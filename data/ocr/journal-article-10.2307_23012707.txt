<plain_text><page sequence="1">Moments and Temporalities of the Avant-Garde "in, of, and from the feminine" Griselda Pollock Why has modernist culture been so unable imaginatively to integrate women's creativity into its narratives of creative radicalism, innovation, dissidence, or transgression? Women are generally missing from conventional stories of the avant-garde. In the recently published landmark volume, Modern Women, MoMA cura tors and invited contributors have finally produced a monument to the design, theater, film, photography, graphic arts, architecture, painting, sculpture, and contemporary media forms created by radical modern ist women, drawn from the collections of the Museum of Modern Art.1 In my introductory essay, I point to two paradoxes. One was the insti tutionalization of avant-garde practices as the curated culture of the modern through musealization itself. The other was that this process was so retrograde, and so antimodern in its outright sexism. "Gender trouble"—to borrow Judith Butler's now famous phrasing—must be acknowledged as one of the central symptoms and neuralgic points of modernity itself. Yet the initial institutionalization of modernism not only failed to acknowledge the centrality of gender to both modernity and its modernisms; it actively fabricated a monogendered, selective narrative of modern art, even in the living presence of the women who defined their moment of modernity through their massive participation in all areas of culture. While personally acquainted with many of these women artists, museum curators and art historians produced a heroic and exclusively masculine legend of the avant-garde that is only being rectified institutionally in 2010.2 I want to propose that, in losing an understanding so finely explored by Clement Greenberg himself in one of the founding American theoretical analyses of the avant-garde, of the avant-garde as a structural position placing itself aesthetically at a distance from the very bourgeois society on which it, nonetheless, depended economically, the curators of the modern museum could also make no sense of the place or meaning of women, or of the radicality of sexual difference, in the avant-garde.3 In other words, the fate of the avant-garde and the fate of women as artists New Literary History, 2010, 41: 795-820</page><page sequence="2">796 NEW LITERARY HISTORY can now be seen to be closely connected. My real question, therefore, is structural: how is "the feminine" implicated in the avant-garde at the level of both theory and practice? In this essay, I shall examine this question from two perspectives. Challenging the linear temporality associated with the avant-garde as the progressive as well as transgressive agency of modernist culture, I suggest there were diverse and discontinuous avant-garde moments at which the defining collision of social and aesthetic radicalisms occurred. While women generally participated in canonical avant-garde moments, there were also some more specific moments particularly attentive to gender and sexual difference. One of these arose in the encounter between feminism and art circa 1970, which must be understood as a distinctive political moment in a long history of feminism—when it addressed the politics of the body—intersecting with a radical moment in art's modernist histories. I then take this rewriting of avant-garde moments in two directions. In the company of several contemporary sociologists, Zygmunt Bau man contests the thesis advanced by Fredric Jameson and other Marx ists that postmodernity is a new phase in late capitalism, in succession to, and a displacement of, modernity. Arguing instead that modernity has entered into a self-reflexive phase, in which its contradictions are being played out, Bauman names the currently destabilized and shift ing conditions of contemporary globalizing consumer culture liquid modernity.4 Liquid modernity exhibits a different logic from the solid melted-resolidified phase of modernity's nineteenth-century emergence, which was characterized by revolutionary interruptions and consolidated new states or forms of government, in which the modern opposed it self to the traditional with the progress-oriented aim of replacement. Vanguardism was a symptom of modernity's faith in social engineering directed towards a permanent destiny, even while several stages might be needed. Remember the originating formulation of the idea of the artist as avant-gardist lay in Utopian political theory as announced by Henri de Saint-Simon at the end of his life.5 No longer fueled by a (con tested) progressive destiny, liquid modernity now modernizes for its own sake, that is, changes merely for the sake of changing, powered by the raw logic of commodification and consumption. Liquefying modernity erodes the solid ground (tradition or dominant political or cultural forms) against which progressive avant-garde transgression alone made sense. In the internally destabilized changefulness of the conditions of liquid modernity, any understanding of avant-garde transgression and its specific gender politics as represented by the latter's encounter with feminism shifts to uncertain ground.</page><page sequence="3">MOMENTS AND TEMPORALITIES OF THE AVANT-GARDE 797 Facing this dilemma, I revisit Julia Kristeva's conjoining of historical materialist and semiotic-psychoanalytical theories of the literary avant garde. By bridging socioeconomic and psychosymbolic levels, Kristeva argued that an avant-garde first emerged in the later nineteenth century to challenge the historically specific articulation in bourgeois society of economic, social, and symbolic forces. As an effect of the bourgeois triangulation of state, family, and religion—linking modes of produc tion, reproduction, and symbolic production—gender/sexual differ ence emerged as a central question in avant-gardism, in the form of a psychosymbolic and metaphorical engagement with "the feminine" and specifically the maternal as the site of a creativity/generativity emancipating itself from the logic and discipline of patriarchal, familial, capitalist production. This "feminine" is not synonymous with socially existing women, and as such, the symbolic negativity of "the feminine" (opposing itself to the phallocentric Symbolic and patriarchal law) was, according to Kristeva, appropriated by men as much as by women as a basis for a positional self-definition as avant-gardists. Yet, while the masculine artist could distance himself from bourgeois culture in the fiction of autogenesis through hysterical identification with/appropria tion of the maternal-feminine, which was then folded into the creative masculine bachelor-subject, women artists had to negotiate the mythic artist-mother fantasy in relation to an all too concrete, socially authorized notion of woman-mother. This psychopositional difference between the son-mother and the daughter-mother plays through the complex politics of gender and sexual difference in both avant-garde practice and its playful identities (Marcel Duchamp comes to mind) and avant-garde socialities which were often marked by sexist, misogynist contradictions (Andre Breton's surrealist circle comes to mind). The social dislocation of women in bourgeois society—having to escape from its novel forms of social confinement and intellectual impoverishment—also accounts for the temporal disjuncture of the belated emergence of a "feminist" avant-garde moment (1920s/1970s). Challenging American and French equal-rights feminism (women seek ing to belong within the bourgeois state) in 1977, Kristeva elaborated a thesis on "Women's Time." She distinguished the linear time of national histories, modes of production, and emancipatory politics (a temporality within which we can place most notions of the avant-garde in general) from monumental time. The latter is the time of sexual difference and modes of reproduction (rather than production) expressed in terms such as patriarchy or phallocentrism that, therefore, impinge on symbolic production, on subjectivity, and on what she names aesthetic practices.6 Kristeva adds a cyclical time associated with, and often metaphorically</page><page sequence="4">798 NEW LITERARY HISTORY represented by, the cycles of female reproductive fertility without be ing bound to their actuality. Cyclical, repeating time (associated with afterwardness, memory, repetition) in turn qualifies the usual idea of revolution, theorized as a rupture in linear historical time, by remind ing us that it shares an etymology with the idea of revolving—of planets and tides, patterns of life and death, the time of species rather than political being. Thus Kristeva posits a counterpoint between sequence/ language (linear) and repetition/body (monumental/cyclical) to stage a profound and long-lasting cultural drama with sexual difference and sexuality at its heart that emerged into historico-symbolic significance at the moment of the first historical avant-garde that challenged state, family, and religion in bourgeois society, placing gender symbolically on its agenda at the same time as bourgeois society placed specific obstacles in the path of thinkers/artists/writers who were women. For Kristeva, religion functions as the socially permitted space for what is excessive to socioeconomic production, namely the body, pain, and pleasure. Religion has been—notably in the Catholic Marian imagery that once dominated the Western imagination and its visual cultures—one of two sites of discourse on the maternal-feminine; the other is science. The avant-garde not only challenged bourgeois ideologies binding state, politics, family, and gender; it also competed with religion for that excess to the sociosymbolic order that touches materiality, corporeality, and the genesis of symbolic forms. Avant-garde practices thus focus on sexuality and play aesthetically with various media's own materialities. It is in this Kristevan perspective that we can read the emergence of a delayed femi nist avant-garde moment in the 1970s marked by a conceptual, cinematic, literary, and artistic attention to the maternal-feminine. Not only has the emergence of the liquid phase of modernity deprived avant-gardist transgression of its opposing, solid ground, but another dimension of modernity has substantially and historically disabled it in a different and unforeseeable way, introducing yet another temporality: traumatic time. I am referring here to the catastrophic rupture at the heart of the twentieth century, whose long-term and traumatic effects have only been belatedly registered in culture.7 That the Holocaust be understood within the logic of modernity is another of Zygmunt Bauman's major sociological revisions. "Auschwitz," the egregious and negative (in the photographic sense) face of modernity—can also be read as the most conservative, homophobic, and antifeminist assault on the radical political deconstructive values of the avant-garde as Kristeva had defined it. "Auschwitz" has also changed the conditions of aesthetic practices, an effect we are belatedly acknowledging. That delay is the mark of trauma, and explains our current cultural attention to what we can name the oxymoron of "traumatic time." Trauma both is without</page><page sequence="5">MOMENTS AND TEMPORALITIES OF THE AVANT-GARDE 799 time, being unrecognized by its subject whom it haunts relentlessly, and is typified by a structure of delay, belatedness, and displaced return.8 Trauma necessitates a different concept of time akin to the monumen tal/ cyclical. It also, however, demands ethical responsibility that, I shall suggest, queries the ethics of a certain masculinist mode of destructive, Oedipal transgression associated with an avant-gardism, which, in the face of such massive twentieth-century and contemporary trauma, risks becoming merely parodic. I shall attempt to show how, in seeking ways to understand a differ entiating history of a nonheroic avant-garde "in, of, and from the femi nine," we retrieve an important legacy from the rereading of modernist avant-garde moments, and from drawing into visibility once again the deeper structural effects of the historical avant-gardes with regard to the "passions of life, death, ethics and narcissism." My argument weaves historical materialism, psychoanalysis, and feminist theories of aesthetics and sexual difference, contesting the rapid shifts in intellectual fashion typical of liquid modernity that are seeping into the academy and lead ing to premature abandonment of certain intellectual-political projects. For all the dangers and complexities of thinking about "the feminine" in any form at all, and certainly now, when high feminist theories of sexual difference are apparently so demode, I shall hope to show how this troubled and troubling concept is still historically significant and theoretically relevant to rethinking the avant-garde. Theoretical Moves I first worked on the avant-garde in 1980 in collaboration with Fred Orton when, as rookie social historians of art, we took on the official modernist versions of the history of art to challenge the identification of the avant-garde with a selective canon of modern art, whereby this exclusive canon valorized, furthermore, as an inevitable historical trajec tory the move of advanced artistic practice from Europe to the United States.9 In place of the manifest destiny thesis applied to the history of modern art by leading American art historians of the time, Fred Orton and I proposed a way of defining the avant-garde as a series of self differentiating identifications that formed avant-garde moments'. An avant-garde does not simply emerge "readymade" from virgin soil to be at tributed a la mode. It is actively formed and it fulfils a particular function. It is the product of self-consciousness on the part of those who identify themselves as, and with a special social and artistic grouping within the intelligentsia at a specific historical conjuncture. It is not a process inherent in the evolution</page><page sequence="6">800 NEW LITERARY HISTORY of art in modern times: it is not the motor of spiritual renovation and artistic innovation; and it is more than an ideological concept, one part of a complex pattern of imagery and belief. An avant-garde is a concrete cultural phenomenon that is realized in terms of identifiable (though never predetermined) practices and representations through which it constitutes itself in relation to, and at a distance from, the overall cultural patterns of its time. Moreover, its construction and the definition of its function result from a broader discursive formation that provides the terms of reference by which artists can see themselves in this illusory but effective mode of difference, and by which others can validate what they are producing as somehow fulfilling an avant-garde's function.10 Analyzing two discontinuous formations, one around 1870 in Paris and another after 1930 in New York, and refusing to link them in an unfold ing narrative of progress, Orton and I theorized dislocated avant-garde moments. An avant-garde moment occurs at the historical point when a specific kind of self-consciousness within a distinctive group emerges to foster identification between members of a self-selecting group or a collection of mutually-referencing groups. These internal identifications serve, in turn, to establish difference and distance from the official cul tural formations. Orton and I thus distanced ourselves, theoretically and historiographically, from the dominant trends in art-historical writing that treated modern art and the avant-garde as synonymous. Such an elision made the latter term meaningless. Accordingly, all art qua art and all artists canonized by modernist art history and the modernist museum immediately had the role of being avant-garde: leading, innovative, and significant. That trend, in other words, was circular. It allowed for no failures of avant-garde moments, no contradictions, internal or otherwise, and no later failure of cultural recognition (thus effectively excluding from legitimation as avant-garde any cultural practice not compatible with a particular, often purely formalist account of modernism). Our project was to turn research back onto the conditions under which both specific moments of avant-garde consciousness were formed and the resulting aesthetic practices were shaped and understood whether critically, or not. I returned to thinking about the avant-garde in 1999 when writing about the first complete exhibition, at the Generali Foundation in Vi enna, of American artist Mary Kelly's Post-Partum Document (1973-79): composed of 139 elements, organized into six parts, now conserved in six different locations over three continents. This assembling of Kelly's multipart project for the first time in a single-site installation invited a critical retrospect on the "moment" of its emergence in the 1970s, that first great feminist decade, which I defined, using the Orton-Pollock formulation, as an avant-garde moment. The difference was that it was</page><page sequence="7">MOMENTS AND TEMPORALITIES OF THE AVANT-GARDE 801 a specifically feminist avant-garde moment occurring at the singular conjunction, around 1970, of independent cinema and emergent video art practices, conceptual art, feminist engagement with contemporary psychoanalytical theories, and a renewed and politicized theorization of, and activism around, gender and sexuality—resuming the broken thread of earlier avant-gardist moments, in Paris in the 1920s for instance. At this moment in the 1970s, for the first time in history, feminism would finally engage with, work on, and intervene in the visual arts. Mary Kelly's project Post-Partum Document coemerged with Laura Mulvey and Peter Wollen's independent film Riddles of the Sphinx (1976) and Julia Kristeva's text Herethique d'amour translated into English as Stabat Mater (1977). I wrote the following: The atmosphere in the mid-seventies was one of experimentation in which cultural practices in art and film produced a laboratory in which the social and the psychic domains in which we are formed as socially positioned and psy chologically constituted subjectivities could be researched in order not only to challenge existing patterns and associated oppressions, but in order to produce knowledge of both what existed and what might be, what was unimaginable and unthinkable in existing terms of patriarchal representation and phallocentric language. I want to suggest that this constituted an avant-garde moment—not in terms of the banal capitalist art market's appropriation of innovation for its tired sake—but in terms of Julia Kristeva's contemporary theorizing of revolutionary poetics that she, however, located only in the late nineteenth century, and in poetry and in work by men. I am suggesting that there was a critical conjunction between the revolutionary poetics of independent cinema, and the poetics of conceptualism that opened a fluid, intertextual aesthetic and theoretical space for a distinctive feminist avant-garde practice: an avant-garde moment "in, of and from the feminine" as defined by a feminist critical consciousness of the unconscious and of language. This avant-garde sought to create knowledge about the feminine that existing discourses or practices could not or did not provide.11 In light of the current theoretical dominance of postfeminist queer theory, I shall need to justify such anachronism as this appeal to the term "the feminine." Expanding the debates about gender beyond the initial feminist inflection towards women, queer theory is vital to our thinking, but not at the cost of outlawing the still unfinished business that it has been a specifically feminist theoretical project to research— not because gender is more important than other arenas of experience, but because feminism alone makes gender a theoretical object. My us age of "the feminine" derives from the existential problematics posed initially by Simone de Beauvoir in 1949 and modified by the vocabulary of Kristevan psychoanalysis and semiotic theory.12 The French term le feminin is not easily translated by the English word feminine or femininity,</page><page sequence="8">802 NEW LITERARY HISTORY which have accrued connotations more typically disowned by feminists. Le feminin does not refer merely to prescribed ideas of what is proper to patriarchally defined women's normalized, gendered behavior. Un derstood as the negated other that consolidates the singular selfhood of the masculine One (de Beauvoir), or as a psychosymbolic position in language, le feminin is defined by Kristeva as "that which is not." Le feminin cannot be in the sense of defining the being of someone: woman is X. Rather it functions positionally as a radical negativity (in the Hegelian sense) that generates renovation and sometimes revolution in the Sym bolic that, ruled by a phallocentric logic, places le feminin as its outside/ excess. While I resist the absoluteness of Kristeva's radical position of le feminin as only a semiotic radicality in phallocentric logic, I want to propose that it is both what is not yet known (for lack of signifiers in phallocentric language) and also what has inevitably and already been, often unconsciously, inscribed into culture precisely by avant-gardist women artists and writers because, as self-conscious avant-gardists, they participated in material, semiotic, and creative dissidence with regard to the patriarchal, bourgeois Symbolic. Yet while avant-gardist experi mentation allowed the space or process for such "other" inscriptions, artist-women might not have recognized what had been inscribed in culture through their aesthetic practices, because the otherness of the feminine in phallocentric culture remains obscured for lack of terms in which to recognize its difference, except as what is "not." If up to now we have lacked the appropriate terms to acknowledge le feminin as the haunting excess of a limiting phallocentrism, as a result of feminist work on language, art, theory, and so forth, we can now both desire to know and frame such difference via terms of analysis and recognition developed by feminist theory, itself an intellectual avant-garde intervention: which is to say, a disturbance of radical significance to the existing orders of meaning.13 In that sense, the attention in feminist theory and practice during the 1970s to both the body and to language, and the intersecting aesthetic and theoretical moves that composed the feminist avant-garde moment, necessarily raised to the level of representational and philo sophical significance the "excess" within patriarchal bourgeois society that had been formerly managed on the latter's behalf by religion, but which now self-consciously radical women—feminists—took on. Kristeva stressed that it was religion that was contested by the avant-garde; but only once feminism had articulated the issues of gender, sexuality, and sexual difference theoretically and aesthetically could the full potential of that contest be staged. It is at this point that the maternal (not motherhood) emerges as an issue, not because of social protests against socially prescribed mother hood in bourgeois society, but because the maternal is the imaginative</page><page sequence="9">MOMENTS AND TEMPORALITIES OF THE AVANT-GARDE 805 and metaphorical site of notions of the creative, the generative, of becoming and of difference, and of the hinge between life and death, desire and ethics. I think it is the confusion between the social ideolo gies of motherhood and the psychosemiotic research into the excess and significance of the maternal-feminine that has created a profound theoretical difficulty in feminist theory and practice. It has tended to make feminism deeply ambivalent toward, rather than bravely interroga tive of, the maternal and/as the feminine. Hence, it becomes important to be so unfashionable as to look at avant-garde representations of the maternal-feminine in art.14 A Dissident Proposal I keep dreaming up exhibitions that no one would or could contem plate putting on. For instance, I would like to create a visual conversation between Mary Cassatt's Reading Figaro, Vincent Van Gogh's La Berceuse and some of his drawings of peasant women from 1885, Pablo Picasso's Portrait of Gertrude Stein, Willem de Kooning's Woman I, while screening Laura Mulvey and Peter Wollen's film Riddles of the Sphinx, Chantal Akerman's Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles and News from Home, Mona Hatoum's Measures of Distance, Martina Attille's Dreaming Rivers, Tracey Moffatt's Night Cries: A Rural Tragedy alongside Charles Chauvel's Jedda and installing as much of Mary Kelly's Post-Partum Document as I could, while commissioning a film about Julia Kristeva delivering her recent lectures on maternal passion and arranging readings of selected texts on Kristeva's own maternity and on woman, creativity, and dissi dence from the 1970s in French and English translation.15 Each of these works deals in a fundamental way with the maternal-feminine as a site of subjectivity and of meaning in intersubjective encounter inflected by manifold dimensions of time, place, social, cultural, and sexual differ ence. All exhibit an aesthetic radicality. For instance, Palestinian artist Mona Hatoum remembers a conversation with her mother in Beirut through letters that speak of love and exile; Martine Attile explores the subjectivity of a Caribbean woman in exile viewed by her children at her deathbed. Tracey Moffat addresses cultural estrangement and personal mourning in the figuration of an Aboriginal woman fostered by a white mother under the epistemic violence of Australian colonialism, while Chantal Akerman works through the silence that is the transgenerational legacy of Holocaust survivorship. Such an exhibition chaotically swerves from the 1870s through to the 1970s and then to the present. In terms of the modernist museum, it incoherendy mixes up paintings and film, documentary and text, cubism</page><page sequence="10">804 NEW LITERARY HISTORY and conceptualism, artworks and cultural theory, Western psychoanalysis and postcolonial cinema, and new media art. Itjuxtaposes heterogeneous avant-garde moments: 1870s Paris, 1900s Paris, 1950s New York, 1970s London and Paris, Beirut, Sydney, and London circa 1988-89. How could Mary Cassatt's impressionist intimiste study of her middle-aged mother reading a newspaper stand beside the dramatic power of Picasso's hom age to Ingres's painting of Monsieur Bertin in his portrait of his patron and fellow genius, the Jewish lesbian writer Gertrude Stein, painted just as he was contemplating beginning Demoiselles d Avignon? What links Cassatt and Van Gogh, let alone both to de Kooning via their relations to Picasso? I want to show how the encounter between selected works of art, as moments of creative dissidence, might help us to recognize the engagement that works of art perform with what disturbs the bourgeois order and also, more recently, their challenging of the forms of ethnic, racist, sexist, or homophobic violence, or the pain of migration and exile. My proposed selection transgresses all the museologically divided categories of medium, style, and movement. It conceptually interrupts established historical narratives and their segregated temporalities. Such a show even unsettles the traditional, exclusionist understanding of the avant-garde, which evaluates works of art for their break with the past in terms of a logic of progressive formal innovation, linking the social and the artistic in the name of a recognized principle of the necessity for change: Marxism, anarchism, antifascism, and so forth. In that light, such an exhibition might seem simply retrograde. With several exceptions, these works are all made by women from diverse moments, cultures, and aesthetic affiliations and thus insist on the heterogeneity of women and of the diverse singularities of the feminine itself. Yet in assembling this group of significant works that undoes any sense of collectivity or homogeneity amongst artists who are women, how are we to account for the shared symptom: the exploration of relations between the maternal, aesthetics, and the avant-gardist self consciousness of intervening in dominant representational languages and social economies of the image? Encounters in Liquid Times and Monumental Time My dreamed-up exhibitions are conceived through a program I call en counters in the virtual feminist museum.16 The virtualfeminist museum—where virtuality is philosophically, not cybernetically, attached to the concept of feminism as something still becoming and to come—is an invitation to revisit past moments, but with (a) difference. The configuration is</page><page sequence="11">MOMENTS AND TEMPORALITIES OF THE AVANT-GARDE 805 driven by what I named in 1999, without any theoretical justification, feminist desire, in order to articulate my epistemophilic ambition to know differently, my curiosity to see difference and to allow different conver sations to take place that might realign our current thinking through novel configurations exposing relationships hitherto suppressed and disappeared by official, phallocentric narratives of cultural history, in cluding the authorized version of modernism.17 Inheritors of a manner of thinking about modernist culture as a project ceaselessly moving forwards and definitively fuelling constant innovation, we are stymied now by "neo"-ism and "post"-ism and worse.18 Current-day Jeremiahs, myself included, lament what appears to be the total penetration of the art world by Adorno's dreaded culture industry in the global mar keting of commodified art and celebrity artists, driven by the necessity to fabricate the latest novelty to keep faith with the commodity-driven idea of progress, which easily mistakes mere newness for once genuine critique.19 Liquid modern times are times of instability and change to which we are responding with often genuine panic, as we have so little to guide us through our newly groundless condition.20 So what can art be or do in liquid modern times? I am suggesting that the concept of the avant-garde in any of its many formulations and moments was, or could only have been, an agency of necessary renovation in an otherwise solid modernity. The newly solid was necessary as a stable ground for avant-garde intervention, innova tion, transgression, radicalization, offering political or aesthetico-political aggravations that sought to effect real change as opposed to fleeting changefulness. Liquid modernity's endless oscillation between fashion and obsoles cence has no guiding purpose (save profit) and is linked to no conviction about where we are going because of alterations of the present. Post modernist disenchantments, some justified, with modernity, furthermore, disabled us from daring to propose a single narrative of improvement in the name of equality (substantial redistributions of wealth, nationally and globally, and real eradication of poverty) or of any other of the now disowned grand narratives of modernity. So, in effect, we are now "up the creek without a theoretical-political paddle" in the face of unfettered globalizing international capitalism, whose powerful economic forces are unleashed from the minimal but still effective correctives created by local and national political regulation that emerged within nation-states through both trade union movements and older conservative pressures in the earlier moments of national capitalism typical of solid modernity. So, wondering why our models for understanding what is going on culturally fail to account for or critically understand a hugely successful</page><page sequence="12">806 NEW LITERARY HISTORY but constantly diversified and shifting art business on a global scale, I think that, paradoxically, an eccentric archaeology of the underanalyzed archive of the modern opens up new potential scripts about what hap pened. Reclaiming them does not lead to some new vanguardist task but to critical thinking that is, perhaps, what remains available to us to demonstrate our fidelity to what we cherished in the historic moments of sociocultural radicalism that bears the label of the avant-garde. If we ask "where is the avant-garde now? Is it a useful category?" might we not be seeking answers either down blind alleys or in already institu tionalized and exclusionary scripts? But if we reexamined some of its invisible dimensions, notably, as I am suggesting, through greater fidelity to its actual historical, experimental, and innovative gender inclusive ness/transgressiveness and varied moments of engagement with sexual difference, might this act of historical archaeology make investigating avant-gardism a litde useful in our present plight? Alternative Models for Thnking The simplest way to explain the basic criteria for my proposed virtual feminist exhibition on the maternal and the avant-garde, on gender, modernity, and renovation, is a juxtaposition. Firstly, there is the infa mous cover created by Alfred H. Barr, Jr., first Director of the Museum of Modern Art for the exhibition of Cubism and Abstract Art in 1936 (Fig. 1). It is set beside a single screen from the forty-nine black canvases hung with a combination of photographs of art works and contemporary visual images created by Hamburg art historian Aby Warburg under the rubric Mnemosyne Bilder Atlas (Memory Picture Atlas) (Fig. 2) in the late 1920s just before his death in 1929. Warburg's assemblages of images demonstrate his singular conception of a nonaestheticising but symbolic art history, created precisely to contest what is encoded in Barr's formal izing and chronological flow chart. Barr's model provided the conceptual and the museological template, as well as the concrete architectural floor plan, for presenting modern art as a flow of art movements tending towards specific destinies—in 1956 geometric and nongeometric abstraction—represented in a man ner removed from historical time and social praxis because the drive forward of artistic innovation is motored by internal, or autonomous, formal necessity. This distillation of formal necessity is undoubtedly a major factor to be considered in studying modernism, but it performs an exclusion of any consideration of what such formalizations might be responding to in society. Too much is erased in the name of isolating</page><page sequence="13">MOMENTS AND TEMPORALITIES OF THE AVANT-GARDE CUBISM AND ABSTRACT ART U-* k Fig. 1 Barr MOMA Chart 1936 Fig. 2 Warburg Mnemosyne Atlas</page><page sequence="14">808 NEW LITERARY HISTORY the self-conscious attention to form as the only and preeminent ques tion for art, instead of asking how and why artists searched for forms for otherwise unrepresented aspects of social reality and lived experience in the conditions of modernity.21 Thus Barr's timeline of the movements descending from post-impressionism in the 1890s to abstract art in the mid-1930s passes chronologically, and without interruption, through the massive historical upheavals of the horrors of the first industrial world war, revolutions, colonial and imperial campaigns, the rise of fascisms, the Third International, Stalinism, the Popular Front, scientific interven tions, and massive social changes brought about by suffrage and mass movements by workers and, of course, by women. Nothing that might pertain to a history of gender transformation, colonial history, racism, technology, philosophy, or physics could be registered as forming part of the conversations that initiated, or were negotiated, by rapid artistic change. Were we to extend Barr's timeline to the present, it would not register the Holocaust, Partition, space travel, AIDS, Szrebinica, 9/11, digitalization, and so on. For many of us, the speed of change and the dizzying accumulation of artistic interventions in this sixty-year period, 1870-1930, that is the crucible of modernism, registers not as a discrete internal unfolding, but rather as a shattering, if not cataclysmic, negotiation in artistic practices with unprecedented change and often traumatic events. On the other hand, paradoxically, Warburg's Mnemosyne Atlas does not so much trace the novelty of art in its responses to challenging conditions of industrial war and social modernity as it discloses persistence within modernity, at deep levels remembered through images, understood as ways of registering and repeating powerful emotions attached to human sociality, life, and death. These image-forms are what Warburg named Pathosformeln, formulations of pathos—where pathos is understood as feeling, passion, suffering in the emotional register and as a kind of sense, understood in relation to the meaning of that word as retained in French. Sens in French is not only on the side of sensation and sensibil ity, but also includes meaning (as in common sense, or making sense of something), without being semantically fixed. Thus Warburg shared with Freud a countervision to the idea of modernity as modernization and self-directed change, arguing that, even as moderns, we are prison ers of monumental/cyclical temporalities at work within both individual psyches and cultural memories in which archaic versions of primary emotions, anxieties, and imaginings persist and return. Or rather, as Freud would argue from 1896 onward via his notion of Nachtraglichkeit, that the initially unassimilable and traumatic mode of such archaic ex periences seeks a form borrowed from the subsequent imaginary and symbolic process of the psychic apparatus.22</page><page sequence="15">MOMENTS AND TEMPORALITIES OF THE AVANT-GARDE 809 Warburg was, however, as much an analyst of his own contemporary visual culture in the decades of European imperialism leading up to World War I and of the racial violence of antisemitism that would erupt in Germany in subsequent decades as he was a scholar of world cultures and notably of the revival of pagan antiquity in Christian Europe in the fifteenth century. Since the 1999 English translation of his major writ ings, Warburg has emerged out of the shadows of esoteric Renaissance studies to take his place as a resource in contemporary cultural theory and art practice and notably amongst feminist thinkers and artists.23 My juxtaposition of Barr and Warburg as models for thinking time in art might be misread as representing the opposition between formal ism and iconography. But that is not the point. Warburg's Pathosformeln mediate between imaging, imagining, and form through the concept of symbolic space. Art is treated as Denkraum: a thinking space that suspends the simple opposition between emotion and reason to suggest art as the space of oscillation and mediation. Freud created a thesis about deep continuity, survival, and persistence in the human psyche, producing his often archaeologically expressed theses about subjectivity in the almost museal surroundings of his own collection of pagan antiquities from religious and cultural traditions other than his own.24 While Warburg and Freud were equally sensitive to, and theorized in their different ways, the novel racializing violence of antisemitic Christian Europe which they themselves witnessed and endured in that very modern period whose culture was indifferently celebrated by Barr as the autonomous progressive daring of a modern art liberated from all history and politics, neither Warburg nor Freud themselves fully registered what Barr absolutely failed to acknowledge: that the modern was also a moment of radicalization of gender and sexual difference. (This is not to deny that Freud was a radical theorist of sexuality who had moments of intense insight and self-criticism about his inability to think his way through the specificity of feminine subjectiv ity and sexuality.) So as to enable both Freud and Warburg to work as partners in conceptualizing the virtual feminist museum, I have to turn to Julia Kristeva, literary theorist and practicing-theorizing psychoanalyst, who transforms Barr's formalism into a dynamic of semiotics and psycho analysis she names semanalyse, while also finding a way to configure the moment of the avant-garde's engineering of modernism as a moment of simultaneous sexual, semiotic, theoretical, and social dissidence, that far from being "modern" in the sense of a simple rupture with the past, has to find ways to negotiate the deep time and deep structures of sexual difference that touch on life, death, and desire. Julia Kristeva declares that, at the turn of the twenty-first century, Western culture is in trouble because it is the first culture in history that</page><page sequence="16">810 NEW LITERARY HISTORY is without a discourse on the maternal, that is, a discourse on human creativity and intersubjectivity such as was represented by mythological and religious thinking about the maternal-feminine. This is not the same, of course, as an ideology of socially prescribed motherhood. Kristeva offers an excoriating analysis of the Sarah Palin phenomenon of the Phallic Mother, while she also returns to her long-standing anxiety about an uncritical feminism's failure to understand its own psychic and unconscious determinations.25 Kristeva has criticized the idealization of the mother in the Western women's movement's self-affirmation of Woman, seeing in what we might call cultural feminism a dangerous potential for a new religion (that is, a space of fantasy about the ideal ized Mother rather than the critical analysis of sexuality, language, and difference). Currently, she notes both a rejection of motherhood and the demand for it: artificial insemination and surrogacy are symptoms of this new, reverse situation: Thus, when feminism goes into reverse, in a rush towards surrogate mothers, and when the unbridled desire to procreate at all cost is accompanied by the macabre series of frozen babies and "forgotten," "abandoned," or "abused" chil dren, will we be able to see that we are the only civilization that lacks a discourse on the maternal vocation? .... Our scientific and medical knowledge is unable to come to the help of feminine distress effectively, a distress that can even lead to maternal madness, and which does not only affect marginalized women. The necessity "to have" a baby by way of an aided "immaculate conception" functions today as an anti-depressant like any other. And why not? But only on condition that its risks, advantages and consequences are elucidated.26 In Revolution in Poetic Language, Kristeva saw the avant-garde located in French literature after Mallarme not merely as a "new form of artistic innovation, but also as a symptom of a crisis in symbolic relations af fecting all areas of social life but more visible in artistic practice than elsewhere."27 Kristeva had anticipated this question of the maternal and the avant-garde because it is so intimately linked to the symbolic relations of language and subjectivity itself. She argued that the state and the family, institutions of social and sexual order, "hold together a certain type of relation between the unity (fixing of meaning and identity) and process (the semiotic, drives and the radical instability of subjectivities on trial) in the economy of the speaking subject, at the same time, being consolidated as a result of this relation."28 The state manages the forces and relations of production; the family ensures unity in the face of the process of drives and pleasure, associated with sexuality and reproduction. Hence the function of the third element of this triumvirate, religion:</page><page sequence="17">MOMENTS AND TEMPORALITIES OF THE AVANT-GARDE 811 This unity, of state and family, is achieved at the price of a murder and a sacri fice—that of the soma, the drive and the process. This is recognized by religion, which thus arrogates to itself the privilege of representing and of speaking the infinite element the ensemble oppresses and yet demands to be spoken. Religion is here that discourse that knows, as far as is possible, what is at stake in the relation between socio-symbolic homogeneity and the heterogeneity of the drives at work within and upon the homogeneity. Complicit with the state and the family to the extent that it restores their other to them, this religious discourse appears not only as the speculative (and often specular) forms of what is unrepresentable in orgasmic pleasure (jouissance) and of what is uncapitaliz able in expenditure of productive forces.29 The complicity of state, family, and religion, far from crumbling with the coming of modernity, was, according to Kristeva, precisely consoli dated by the triumph of bourgeois society in the later nineteenth century. This is the striking novelty of Kristeva's argument. Secularization was not the dissolution of an age of Christianity; nineteenth-century bourgeois culture and society was the contradictory moment of its social sublima tion. The embourgeoisement of (Christian) religion manages the somatic and psychic excess not otherwise allowed into social representation in the tightening capitalist economies of production and phallocentric re production—Victorian values, if you will. This sublimation was, however, simultaneously contested by a new formation of art in the guise of the avant-garde. Art, so to speak, was progressively to seek its independence from the very discourses and institutions upon which it was founded. This complicity of family, state and religious discourse appears for the first time in the second half of the 19th century, following the triumph of the bourgeois revolution, the consolidation of capitalism, and the accompanying fulfillment of the Christian religion. At the same time, there also appears the subversive function of "art"—subversive because of the way it cuts through and reworks the frontiers of the socio-symbolic ensembles.30 (My emphasis) What happened in art, literature, and music as well as many related intel lectual trends such as psychoanalysis with the coming of the avant-garde, constituted a break with fundamental concepts of the monumentally timed sociosymbolic ensemble. The break destabilized the existing, patriarchal knot of gender, sexuality, and sexual difference. Since the Renaissance, Western figurative art had shared a fundamental intimacy with Christianity that shaped not just its content, but also the very plastic and aesthetic character of its representational ideologies and practices epitomized by the primacy of its figuration of the body. The Christian theology of the Incarnation and the relation between a word made visible and a word made flesh provided the deepest drive</page><page sequence="18">812 NEW LITERARY HISTORY in Western visual arts towards its particular conquest of mimetic rep resentation that was based on the pictorial narrative and on placing the human figure in geometrically perspectival compositions. This art developed gesture and pose to incite the appropriate affective reception of theological propositions through the spectator's imaginary identifica tion with anthropomorphic illusion. The theology of Incarnation incited, therefore, a particular trajectory in artistic representation that defined the Western visual imaginary until the mid-nineteenth century when it was interrogated and ultimately interrupted by art practices that were not so much antiacademic, or antirealist (as we are usually taught) as de-Christianizing, that is, liberating the psychosomatic and the psycho symbolic from the religious imaginary. In the tension between theological metaphor and a visual picturing that works iconically through representation of the body, the seeds of the avant-garde revolt against, and contest for, the imaginative ground occupied by religion can be traced. Religion is a metaphorical discourse speaking in linguistic or representational terms of what defies such saying and seeing that yet is only imaginable within them—except, that is, for the excess which religious practice, ritual, and aesthetically hypercharged experience allows into, but also manages on behalf of, the sociosymbolic order, namely affectivity, intensity, mysticism, and momentary (dis)pos session of the self: jouissance. In defying visual art's function as the representational screen for an Incarnation theology, the avant-garde, according to Kristeva, tries to force into productive acknowledgement both the materiality and the af fectivity that underpins the signifying system, the psychosemiotic processes that significatory unity tries to fix ideologically as socially authoritative meaning.31 The project of the avant-garde is to deal with the irreparable dislocation between signifier and referent occasioned in bourgeois capitalist modernity, where the referent lost the transcendent meaning guaranteed by religious discourse. Modernism reminds us endlessly that there are only signifiers and their subjectivizing affects. Yet even in its semiotic nakedness, the poetic or artistic play of signifiers affects us; we are touched and animated by something beyond the symbolic system that tries to harness excess for the sake of socially sanctioned meaning. In coming to know that, however, art lost its faith in its ability as well as its need to provide the visualization of an incarnated subject sustained by imaginary identification and anthropomorphic space. (Cinema might be said to have assumed its mantle.) For Kristeva, therefore, avant-garde art is, structurally, if never ideo logically, both atheist and potentially noniconic, more preoccupied with elements such as rhythm or sonority and its visual equivalents, color, gesture, pulsation. Instead of trying to provide representations of God</page><page sequence="19">MOMENTS AND TEMPORALITIES OF THE AVANT-GARDE 813 realized as an idealized Body, it searched for the means to register the sacrificed soma, that is, the drives and pleasures lining the speaking human subject, the subject on trial and in process, because subjectiv ity is never achieved but is always a challenged process of becoming that is equally at risk of unraveling, as is the case with melancholia or psychosis. Kristeva's insight would inevitably take research back to the foreclosed other of phallocentric signification. Even in its predominantly masculinist mode, the avant-garde retrieved the lost maternal body and her jouissance, epitomized in the form of what Kristeva identified as the massacred feminine of de Kooning's paintings of Woman rather than the idealized Madonna of Giovanni Bellini, whose work stands at the beginning of the incarnational turn in Western painting.32 In her essay, "A New Type of Intellectual: The Dissident" (1977), in which sexual difference is clearly positioned in relation to various avant garde positions of dissidence, Kristeva identifies four key characters: the political rebel, the avant-garde writer, the psychoanalyst, and, finally, "woman." "Woman" is not like the others, however, as she is not a social or professional type. "Woman" signifies le feminin as a complex psycho linguistic and sociohistorical knot still to be deciphered and spoken, even while playing a fundamental role in human sociality through actual women that is radically misread as mere social instrumentality: breed ing, raising children for the state. She writes: "We still cannot reply to Mallarme's question: What is there to be said concerning childbirth ?, which is probably just as poignant if not more than the famous Che Vuoi? which Freud once addressed to a woman. After the Virgin, what do we know of a mother's (interior) speech? .... Through the events of her life, a woman thus finds herself at the pivot of sociality—she is at once the guarantee and a threat to its stability."33 As both the socially managed guarantee of sociality in her role as bearer of new generations, and as a signifier of radical dissidence in relation to the phallocentric system governing bourgeois culture (which inherits different Western paradigms of the patriarchal symbolic), "Woman" signifies a resistance to the bourgeois triangulation of the state, the religion, and the family, as well as to instrumental reason's war on critical thought. But, asks Kristeva, what about female creation, creativity, and thought? "Under these conditions, female 'creation' cannot be taken for granted. It can be said that artistic creation always feeds on an identification or rivalry, with what is presumed to be the mother's jouissance (which has nothing agreeable about it.) That is why one of the most accurate representations of creation, that is of artistic practice, is the series of paintings by Kooning entitled Women, savage, explosive, funny and inaccessible creatures in spite of the fact that they have been massacred."34</page><page sequence="20">814 NEW LITERARY HISTORY De Kooning's painting Woman both contains references to the artist's historic mother and links that motherline to the emblematic figure for the late nineteenth-century artistic avant-garde that is the antithesis of the maternal: the prostitute's body. Kristeva then has to acknowledge the implications of sexual difference for the thesis demonstrated by de Kooning's Woman. Masculine envy of or identification with the Mother, played out through the oscillations of de Kooning's ludic monumentaliza tion of the Goddess-Mother and the violence of the paint with which this "she" is both created and abused, is radically different from a woman's artistic engagements with this topic. So Kristeva asks: But what if [such paintings] had been created by a woman? Obviously she would have to deal with her own mother, and therefore, with herself which is a lot less funny. That is why there is not a lot of female laughter to be found ... In any case, far from contradicting creativity, maternity as such can favor a certain kind of female creation ... in so far as it lifts fixations, and circulates passion between life and death, self and other, culture and nature, singularity and ethics, narcissism and self-denial. Maternity may thus be called Penelope's tapestry or Leibniz's network, depending on whether it follows the logic of gestures or of thought, but it always succeeds in connecting up heterogeneous sites.35 The exhibition I propose is not a demonstration, a pedagogical re presentation of a known narrative. It could, I hope, create a thinking space to allow into visual and thoughtful encounter what is in a sense already there, inscribed across works that variously figure the maternal in ways excessive to the bourgeois ideologies of domesticated motherhood and its vicious antithesis, the prostitute, allowing ethnic and cultural as well as historical and sexual specificities into the field of vision, while articulating intellectuality with creativity in the actually or virtually genera tive "woman." Mary Cassatt's portrait of an adult woman in later middle age reading shares a monumentality and gravity with Picasso's vision of lesbian poet Gertrude Stein, while the presence of the latter disturbs the Oedipal filiation between de Kooning's passionate and ferocious rework ing of Picasso's other work of 1907, the Demoiselles d Avignon, by making us think about the conversations over eighty sittings between the not yet Picasso and a Jewish lesbian intellectual who was prescient enough to see what he was capable of becoming. If these paintings still operate within and against the figurative embodiment of Picasso's position and place, their juxtaposition with works of the international, postcolonial, and queer feminist avant-garde highlights the specific relation between novel modes of artistic inscription enabled, not by abstraction, but by the Kristevan shift into an noniconic/atheistic engagement with avant garde textuality, visuality, and temporality that draws on cinematic and</page><page sequence="21">MOMENTS AND TEMPORALITIES OF THE AVANT-GARDE 815 postconceptual possibilities that might enable inscriptions of many forms of difference. Thus Mary Kelly's exploration of the mutual production of maternal and masculine child subjectivities in the specific economics and politics of class and the sexual division of labor engages with Mulvey and Wollen's seven-part antinarrative cinematic exploration of comparable tensions between work and desire by reclaiming the questioning figure of Oedipus's challenger, the Sphinx. I might conclude the exhibition by looking at another work by Mary Kelly, Interim (1984-90), whose interest is enhanced by locating its resonance in relation to my curious genealogy of feminism and the avant-garde. An-iconic to a degree even more remarkable than the Post partum Document, Interim stages the contradictions of femininity over a four-part installation: Corpus, Pecunia, Historia, Potestas (Body, Money, History, Power). Composed of galvanized steel folded in a form evoca tive of the greeting card that marks life cycle events, Pecunia stages four categorizations of the feminine signified in popular cultural form by the rites of female passage: mater, conju, filia (mother, wife, daughter) and the aberrant, unplaceable figure of soror, sister. Each section has two stories, a joke about how to make a million dollars, an advertisement from a personal column, and a final statement of each subject position. Soror is the loose cannon who refuses her place within the heteronorma tive reproductive economy that defines the daughter, the wife, and the mother. Soror stands for the middle-aged artist, the lesbian or the single woman, wanting a complex life and a creativity beyond the violence of the patriarchal frame, wanting the money and the space of the artist: a studio of her own in the country, wanting a position beyond the economy of exchange of women. The trope of Soror perhaps comes closest to Mary Cassatt, whose considerable earnings from her paintings and pastels enabled her to buy a chateau in France where, in 1927, she died renowned at the age of 83. Yet, there is a vast and historically significant gulf between the mother-daughter genealogy that Mary Cassatt could evoke in her figurative paintings of her mother and sister as a support for an artistic subjectivity utterly identified with the project of modernization in artis tic institutions, practice, and representational schema, and the work of Mary Kelly in the 1970s after a century of the avant-gardes. Kelly had to utilize and radically to intervene in the critical, an-iconic resources of postminimalist conceptual art to stage a theoretically inflected analysis of how dominant representations of the maternal-feminine exile the woman as creative subject. The complexity of Kelly's long term, multi part installations, created in oblique if always brilliant dialogue with the mainstream of conceptualism, aptly confirms my conviction that</page><page sequence="22">816 NEW LITERARY HISTORY the radical transformation of the conditions of sexual difference and subjectivity structuring the historical avant-gardes of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries remains, even now, profoundly unfinished, indeed that it is only just verging on the point of serious intelligibility today. Thus, far from being a momentary connection lost in the disjunctive temporality of the century of the avant-gardes, the current alliance of feminist interventions in culture and thought and an avant-garde poetics, initiated in the 1970s and sustained by a theoretical as well as creative flowering since, still has a major task to perform against the dizzying proliferation of the eroticized commodified image of woman that veils the deeper deadliness of the cultures of death. Thus any consideration of the avant-garde from a feminist perspec tive must initially unearth the maternal as body or ground for the autogenetic fantasy of masculine creativity as it has been absorbed, overwritten, fantasized, and "massacred." Only then can we explore different aesthetic inscriptions of the maternal within critical practices at decisive moments that rupture the social-symbolic ensemble of the Western racist, homophobic, and phallocentric Symbolic. Thereafter we can begin to track the maternal as a site for feminine (that is, dissonant politically or subjectively) genealogies of sexualities and subjectivities, of life and the desire for the life of the other. Thus maternity—as op posed to the socially sublimated Marianism of right-wing ideologies of motherhood—becomes, when artistically reconfigured, a thinking apparatus that raises the very questions tracked back in Warburg's Mnemosyne Atlas to pagan ritual and its formalized encodings as image memory and in Freud's archaeology of the psyche: passion/thought between life and death, self and other, culture and nature, singularity and ethics, narcissism and inter- or transsubjectivity. At once generative and foundationally ethical, the maternal-feminine as such a thinking apparatus reexamines the potential significance of what has been so repressed within Western culture. And for historical reasons, in terms of contemporary liquid times governed by commodity production and technology which is reaching into this foundational crucible of human subjectivity, the creative feminine-maternal complex emerges as a site of profound radicality now. This is where the conjunction of feminist criti cal interrogation of its own thought and of the place of the feminine in culture historically and currently encounters "Auschwitz"—the product of totalitarian fascist masculinity that appropriated the right to life and death, relegated women to social functionality, and hence formed a politico-aesthetic avant-garde that was the antithesis, the negative other, to the avant-garde in, of, and from the feminine I have been trying to outline.</page><page sequence="23">MOMENTS AND TEMPORALITIES OF THE AVANT-GARDE 817 Conclusion In his critical anatomy of the exhaustion of the paradigm of avant garde transgression as the motor for modern artistic gestures, Anthony Julius refers to Hell by Jake and Dinos Chapman (1999-2000). This vast installation created a swastika out of linked vitrines in which a multitude of toy figurines performed acts of horrifying violence on each other in an environment that evoked concentration and extermination camps while the majority of the brutally injured were apparently German soldiers or SS. Confusing the aestheticization of fascism and sadomasochism (which so often now borrows SS insignia) with the horror of the historical camps, Hell generated considerable anxiety amongst critics. In challenging cer tain critics's celebratory claims that this work of taboo-breaking horror offered "imaginative empathy," Julius argues that extreme events such as the "Holocaust [no longer] mandate transgressive art." To the contrary, art-making responsive to the Holocaust demands a break with the transgressive aesthetic. . . . The best of these works contend with these dilemmas: how can the Holocaust be represented, when representation seems to entail the making of art objects that invite purely aesthetic contemplation? .... Only a non-transgressive art practice, one that acknowledges the certainty of defeat and is willing to efface itself before its subject, while knowing that this subject is an impossible one, can negotiate such complexities. It must be allusive, modest, fragile, provisional. It must give witness to the inadequacy of images, and therefore its own inadequacy, to retrieve meaning of the lives that were extinguished. ... It is an art that meets its subject at the mind's limits. It knows that there are limits to representation that cannot be removed, in the critic Geoffrey Hartman's phrase, "without psychic danger."36 I would like to conclude by endorsing Julius's views about art that dares to explore this immense question of historical trauma and aesthetic in scription. In his description of the kind of art that alone can meet such a challenge, which is defined as the opposite of the now parodied notion of vanguardism as heroic transgression, we find in fact a description of what the avant-garde "in, of, and from the feminine" actually looked like. Thus when in her 1996 exhibition of thirty-nine international art ists, all of whom were women who showed how complex difference is, Catherine de Zegher proposed "an elliptical traverse" across the twentieth century to trace various clusters of aesthetic practices that transgressed chronological, national, ethnic and sexual categories (1930s, 1960s, 1990s, Europe, Latin America, Asia, African-American, Latin American cultures, etc.), she was identifying in the work of women their struggle with both the social real of modernity and the psychosymbolic modern</page><page sequence="24">818 NEW LITERARY history ization of language and subjectivity. She showed how diverse feminine negotiations of difference represented the other side of militarized, misogynist, homophobic, and genocidally racist fascism that would, in its egregious crimes against humanity, ultimately condition humanity.37 Far from being a marginal addition to a mainstream (art) history, the investigation into the feminine/maternal and the genuinely radical in the histories of the modern era becomes a vital archive for discerning, beneath the unstable liquidity of liquid modernity, the deeper and persistent challenges of the passions of life and death, ethics and narcis sism, which can be named as the desire for the other to live beside us, with us, and in all the gloriousness and complexity of human plurality.

Rather the lament is for the penetration of the art world by marketing, mediated by market-oriented curation and heritage and attendance figure-oriented museum programming. When presenting a distinguished and passionate dealer who had promoted abstract drawing since the 1960s with the work of one American artist seeking some support from a gallery, the dealer replied that the work was far too intelligent for any gallery to take it on at this time. The disjunction between a kind fidelity to art mediated by dealers and gallery owners who believe in its importance and current conditions for getting one's career made through marketing is growing. 20 Zygmunt Bauman, Liquid Modernity (Cambridge: Polity, 2000) soon followed by Liq uid Love: The Frailty of Human Bonds (Cambridge: Polity, 2003), Liquid Life (Cambridge: Polity, 2005), Liquid Fear (Cambridge: Polity, 2005), and Liquid Times: Living in an Age of Uncertainty (Cambridge: Polity, 2007). 21 See T.
