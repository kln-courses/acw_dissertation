<plain_text><page sequence="1">MAKING MODERNITY INSIDE THE TECHNOLOGICAL SPACE OF THE RAILWAY Marian Aguiar I he recent critical turn to the topic of the modern has questioned the homogeneity of modernity. Reflections have brought to the fore particular contexts, highlighting the conditions represented within those contexts. For this current scholarship, the pertinent question seems less "What is modernity?" than "Where is modernity?" and "What experiences characterize its uneven locations?" This essay con siders both latter questions in the decolonizing context represented by South Asian partition literature. In approaching modernity in a global context, it is useful to think of modernity as rhetoric and then to explore the material history of this rhetoric as it functioned through representational forms. By doing so, one may see both the history of modernity as a fluid concept and its role as an instrument of empire, in which its meaning was and is taken as given. In the first part of this essay, I situate modernity theoretically in terms of both its rhetorical and material expression in places where its history has been inculcated with a colonial past and the promise of a national future. I consider how modernity retains its attraction, a phenomenon some recent critics of alternative modernity (e.g., Gaon kar) have explained by considering how the concept may be opened up to cultural specificity. I argue that this theorization does not ade quately address how modernity continues to be reduced to equiva lents. One main equivalent is technology, which becomes a metonym for modernity. The equation fosters a conceptual reduction of technol ogy itself, for technology appears a self-evident testimony to a series of interconnected ideologies, including rationality, progress, and sec ularism. But technology, looked at as an imaginary, can actually bring us back to the concept of a fluid modernity To demonstrate this, I look at the reconceptualization of modernity Cultural Critique 68?Winter 2008?Copyright 2008 Regents of the University of Minnesota</page><page sequence="2">MAKING MODERNITY | 67 in the context of South Asia's partition by evaluating the representa tions of what is often taken as material evidence of modernity: tech nology, specifically the railway. Partition literature spans over fifty years and includes three works I discuss in this article: Khushwant Singh's 1956 novel Train to Pakistan, Bhisham Sahni's 1950s story "We Have Arrived in Amritsar," and Mukul Kesavan's 1995 novel Looking through Glass.1 Representations of the railway in this literature reveal how an important rhetoric of modernity becomes mobilized. Technol ogy emblemizes certain principals of Western modernity, yet, some what surprisingly, representations of technology also cast the very antithesis of these seemingly self-evident associations. Images of the railway slip in and out of such equivalents as nationalism, rationality, secularism, and deterritorialization. Counternarratives of modernity emerge from the very heart of narratives of technology. These counternarratives turn time back wards, transform technology into a body, ascribe the machine with an uncanny presence, mark the train carriage as a communal space em bedded in the local world around it, and reverse the narrative of prog ress. The technological imaginary includes these counternarratives of modernity, which are produced by the dialectical expression of modernity. The narratives are carried alongside the colonial rhetoric of modernity, destabilizing the seemingly self-apparent equation of modernity and technology. Although these counternarratives exist alongside representations of technology across all cultural contexts, they highlight the particular expressions of modernity outside of a Western context. MODERNITY IN A DECOLONIZING CONTEXT The term "modernity," in theory, is wide open. Modernity's master narrative was never whole, in the sense that the evolving philosophi cal conception of the modern consistently posited the negation of its every expression as fundamental to its very existence. An early notion simply designated a transition between antiquity and the new, but the term underwent a significant shift in meaning during the period of Enlightenment. Modernity became a mode of relating to contem porary reality. In this mode, the present is continually interrogated by</page><page sequence="3">68 | MARIAN AGUIAR self-conscious subjectivity (Habermas 16), creating a forward-driving paradigm that rejects both the immediate past and, perhaps more im portantly for the decolonizing context, the present (Lazarus 18). New approaches to the history of colonization have exposed how modernity has been deeply embedded within colonial and neocolonial projects (e.g., Prakash). Corrective theories of modernity map terrains based on uneven power relations in such conceptual locations as the non-West, the postcolonial nation, or the transnational space of the African diaspora (e.g., Gaonkar, Gilroy). When modernity is relocated to places torn by debates about cultural affiliation, it is also reshaped along the contours of a local space by imaginative and material prac tices that are both individual and collective. Within the imperial or colonial context, this includes multiple cultural inheritances. Colonial and national histories inscribed modernity with various meanings, some of which offered liberation and some of which reentrenched difference. Viewed within a global arena, modernity has a peculiar temporal ity that has expanded to encompass multiple cultural contexts; these diverse contexts rewrite any homogeneous notion of a present (Mak disi 275). Partha Chatterjee describes an ambivalent and contradic tory modernity within a totalizing discourse that travels from Europe to India via colonialism. He explores the idea of Indian modernity as a discourse that "thinks with and also thinks against" a Western modernity that is, for him, framed by the nation. Chatterjee critiques a dominant discourse of nationalism that portrays "third-world nation alism" as a discourse derivative of a Western form, which is "modular ... invariably shaped according to contours outlined by given histor ical models" (Nationalist Thought 21). That modular history offers the rise of industrialism as the foundation of the nation. All that is re quired to make nationalism fit into non-Western contexts is to fine tune the specific production of national subjectivity. The problem with this understanding of nationalism is that it preempts interrogat ing the premises of new nationalisms (or new modernities) that might not necessarily be linked to industrialization. These nationalisms will fail on numerous counts: the non-European colonial countries will never be able to achieve full nationhood, yet these places will be doomed to trying to do so; furthermore, the meaning of national sub jectivity will always be "given" and never actively made.</page><page sequence="4">MAKING MODERNITY | 69 Chatterjee shifts the terrain of debate from the modern rhetoric of technology as emancipation, not only by introducing the politics of location but by "plac(ing) thought itself, including thought that is sup posedly rational and scientific, within a discourse of power" (Chatter jee, Our Modernity 11). Returning to the work of Kant and Foucault, he characterizes modernity as situated within a present that views itself as a break from the past. Within this present lies a civic forum, one that is constituted?in the ideal?by a freedom of reason and voice. Chatterjee questions how this freedom can be deployed within institutional power structures that validate certain voices and sup press others. He calls us to reread the philosophical discourse of modernity in light of its material history implanted in a dynamics of power; departing from an essential definition of "modernity" he moves toward one where meaning grows out of a context of domi nation. Chatterjee recognizes the material history of the concept of modernity did not negate its attraction, for though Indians have chal lenged a universal modernity, they have also sought to create their own. Thus modernity continues to be the site of "the burden of rea son, dreams of freedom; the desire for power, resistance to power" (Chatterjee, Our Modernity 14). Despite its fraught status, modernity is, as Dilip Gaonkar puts it, "more often perceived as a lure than a threat" (17). No matter how complex has been the theorization of modernity, its rhetoric has mobilized easy correspondence. This is despite Chat terjee's theoretical challenges to a singular notion of modernity and the important work of others who have taken up like-minded projects (e.g. Gilroy, Gaonkar, Harootunian, Mitchell). The rhetorical function of modernity allows us to see the chain of equivalents through which the concept functions. Technology and the conceptual structure of modernity play key roles here. Modernity has an authoritative capac ity to act as a narrative form, what Fredric Jameson calls a "unique kind of rhetorical effect, or if you prefer, a trope" (34). This form, I argue, is continually filled with the equation of modernity and technology. Technological materials perform as embodied, concretized symbols that stand in for modernity. The concept of modernity and the advent of the first industrial machines come together with a "gravitational impact" (Jameson 145); the concordance "thereafter seem[s] indissol uble, even in our own historiographically far more self-conscious era,</page><page sequence="5">70 | MARIAN AGUIAR when everyone decries a 'technological determinism' that they secretly harbor in their heart of hearts" (Jameson 145). Jameson writes of modernity in general, but the concordance he finds between modernity and technology holds particular relevance for colonized and decolonizing spaces. The view that links modernity and technology plays a prominent role in empire, which presents the machine as the embodiment of a particular rational, empirical cul tural practice that will be part of a mandatory lesson in civilization. The historical context of India and the railway illustrates this perva sive correlation between modernity and technology. John Chapman, promoter of the Great Indian Peninsular Railway, wrote in 1850 of "the double hope of earning an honourable competency and of aid ing in imparting to our fellow subjects in India, a participation in the advantages of the greatest invention of modern times" (quoted in Headrick 182). Chapman assumed a shared imperial subjectivity, yet undermined the equity of this relationship by framing it in terms of beneficence. Development was undertaken through technological transformation, and the railway, specifically the idea of the railway, became the carrier of modernity In "The Future Results of British Rule in India," published in the New York Daily Tribune in 1853, three years after railway construction began in India, Karl Marx echoed these sentiments toward a slightly different end. "England," he wrote, "has to fulfill a double mission in India: one destructive, the other regen erating?the annihilation of old Asiatic society, and the laying of the material foundations of Western society in Asia" (332). Marx intended to bring India to its full potential as a fully industrialized society, and he saw the railway as the "forerunner of modern industry" (335). Tech nology became the concrete sign of a progressive orientation to such an extent that in 1877 a British official wrote: "Any history of the mate rial progress of India may well be divided into a pre-railway and a post railway period" (Danvers 7; cited in Kerr, "Representations," 296"). The rhetoric of modernity equated colonial governance and tech nological transformation. Together these structures enmeshed the lives of people within the colonial context; as Gyan Prakash phrases it, "they constitute a grid, a coherent strategy of power and identity under pinned by an ideology of modernity that is legitimated in the last instance by science" (Prakash 3). Science, including technological de velopment, thus performed a kind of "cultural authority" in India.</page><page sequence="6">MAKING MODERNITY | 71 This rhetoric may be found even inside theories disavowing a tech nological measure of modernity; the discourse of Mohandas Gandhi reveals the way the material forms of technology become images of colonialism. Gandhi specifically linked technology and modernity; in a 1900 letter to Henry Polak, a close friend and South African lawyer, he writes: "It is not the British people who are ruling India, but it is modern civilization, through its railways, telegraphs, telephones, and almost every invention which has been claimed to be a triumph of civilisation" (Gandhi 130). As a technological object, the train acted as metonym for moder nity?its very existence testified to the presence and legitimacy of the modern; modernity was rendered imaginatively through the materi als of technology. The railway became modernity's most prominent emblem: historian Eric Hobsbawm once called the railway a "syno nym for ultra-modernity" (Hobsbawm 89).2 As we view the mobili zation of modernity's rhetoric in postcolonial nation building, we can trace it through the representation of technology. The story that unfolds as we look at colonial and postcolonial rep resentations of the train, however, sometimes diverges in surprising ways from the colonial rhetoric of modernity as technology. The colo nial rhetoric of technology might well have drawn its net using the material icons of technology and science?and even today the railway in India stands as a symbol to many of Britain's model of progress? but it also enabled other, competing ideologies to enter in the same form. The technological object certainly became a justification for colo nial rule, but it was also the repository of multiple significations that overflowed its assigned role. James A. Flath describes the circulation of the concept of a steam engine in China: "The consequence was nei ther a wholesale embrace nor a rejection of the introduced technology, but rather a new discourse over its meaning that may best be called colonial-modernism" (168). Flath goes on to situate the new meanings of modernity within "tensions presented by imperialism and indus trial technology" (168). The technology itself, as a kind of imaginary, was instrumental to those new meanings. Although colonial rhetoric of the railway equated technology with the progress of a secular nation, the train's symbolic form allowed it more changeability in practice. In the realm of literary representation we may see the countervailing impulses that undermine such one-to-one correspondences.</page><page sequence="7">72 | MARIAN AGUIAR The exploration of the railway as a material and cultural site illu minates many different aspects of the worlds it traveled through, in cluding a shifting set of social relations and changing constructions of space and time. What the train means derives from an amalgamation of representations and functions, and these are shaped by historical context. The railway's myriad meanings deployed tropes historically associated with the train as a representational object, including con cepts of linear space and time, notions of progress binaries of interior and exterior, representations of the nation, and deterritorialization. One may read the changing signification of the train?how represen tations retain, reject, or remake some of these narratives; how they recast time and space?in order to see the revision of modernity in the context of South Asia's Partition. With representational forms that included iconography and imagery, as well as the construction and inhabitation of space, the technological object remade the narrative of modernity to which it was bound. COUNTERNARRATIVES OF MODERNITY Within the Indian colonial context, even the material infrastructure denotes the railway imaginary; Ian Kerr writes "the railways them selves?the stations, the bridges, the tunnels etc.?were part of the process of representing, of signifying what it was railways were or hoped to be" ("Representations," 291). Since the nineteenth century, the Indian train has played an important material and symbolic role as a primary national transportation system. During Partition, polit ical leaders saw the train as a vehicle to concretize political plans for partition and made arrangements for special trains as part of reloca tion efforts (Khosla). These government and railway officials saw the train as a safe vehicle for relocation, for the rhetoric of modernity that was the legacy of the colonial period promised that the state space of the railway would supersede what appeared as localized violence. Many refugees believed strongly in the vision of the railway system as inviolable space, a faith that may be linked back to the insurance of the railway by the civil government (see Kerr's Introduction to his Railways in Modern India, on Indian railway's relation to colonial and national governments). As refugees sought a place on the crowded</page><page sequence="8">MAKING MODERNITY | 73 trains of 1947 India, they saw in the railway a national, secular space that could transcend the religious difference that now manifested itself in violence. The trains were not safe, for they did not have proper state protection and the soldiers who did travel onboard often had their own communal allegiances; an article in an October 1947 issue of the British Railway Gazette had 3000 passengers killed on a Muslim refugee train in Amritsar ("Indian Railways"). The massacres, beatings, and rapes in and around the trains eroded the ideal of the secular nation, breaking down the civil dreams of modernity. Scenes of Partition violence were not simply evidence of a return to tradition from modernity. Written and oral histories describe how local identities, such as those of village or class, often superseded oth ers until that moment of crisis (Hasan). During Partition in South Asia, communal identities were retroactively cast as original divisions. In these cases, communal identities were ironically formulated simul taneous to the nation-states. At that historical moment in a cracking India, communal identities were subordinate to national identity (as the decision was made to create two states), while simultaneously reli gious affiliations found voice in the form of the nation. The categories of national and local, secular and communal were thus articulated through each other. Within this confluence of opposing narratives of modernity, the train held a central place as an overdetermined symbol of modernity. The railway's ability to reconstruct space and time through movement made it a primary space for the constitution of new identities. The train was an agent of deterritorialization, for it transferred its occu pants into a new collectivity out of their original local context. In the process, the trains produced an identity extracted from the complex ities of location. The collectivity was an anonymous one that placed people in harm's way even more than they might have been in a vil lage where they had long-standing relationships across communal lines. The trains themselves represented communal identities that were abstracted from bodies, thus carriages became prime targets as the vehicle came to embody those particular identities (we see this equa tion in contemporary communal violence aimed at the train, such as the attack on the Godhra passenger train in 2002). Movement helped create these abstract identities. The direction the train signified the identities of the passengers and made them vulnerable to attack. A</page><page sequence="9">74 | MARIAN AGUIAR train traveling east near the border became a signifier of Hindus and one traveling west a symbol of Muslims. Partition writers both invoked and altered narratives of the rail way. At the very heart of Western modernity, according to Anthony Giddens, lies a process in which social relations are disembedded (Gid dens 17)?the spatialization of the train enacts this process in sym bolic and material form. The dominant paradigm of the train is that of a space, suspended from the intimacy of place and transformed into abstract, symbolic terms that rely on anonymity. This is why the tableau of the carriage is so often a metaphor for the nation. In liter ary and visual renderings, the train represents the nation: to those who view the passing train, it appears as a concrete sign of an abstract collective identity; to the passengers inside, the train represents the nation moving toward its imagined realization. Very early in the Indian context, the space of the railway signified the secular nation; for exam ple, a Sikh character in Rudyard Kipling's novel Kim, calls out: "Enter! This thing is the work of the Government" (75). In Kipling's same novel, characters from different regions and religions gather together to dis cuss a future India that will supersede these differences. The railroad car, as a public space, has historically attempted to reproduce the national space by inscribing its ideology, hierarchies, and divisions. The railway produces as well as reveals this logic, acting as an emis sary of the nation that promises to enclose all within its security. The shift from an embedded identity to a dislocated one cast in national terms appears in much of the railway imagery of Partition literature, but in these works the national has become derationalized, communal, and embodied. The breakdown of this ideal, represented as a "ghost train" in Khushwant Singh's famous 1956 novel Train to Pakistan, presents the deterritorialization and amalgamation of the communal. The train that previously signified a security based in its perceived national secular character instead becomes the embodiment of a national communal identity. Singh borrows counternarratives of modernity?the anthropomorphic machine, the uncanny presence of the modern?to alter notions of what modernity means in this particular context. Bhisham Sahni, in his story "We Have Arrived in Amritsar" ("Amritsar Aa Gaya Hai'), represents the permeability of boundaries between the interior and the exterior of the train. In doing so, he challenges the abstraction from local space that dominates</page><page sequence="10">MAKING MODERNITY | 75 the imaginative railway space. Both writers revise paradigms of the railway imaginary and, in doing so, transform the representation of modernity. In Train to Pakistan, the image of the train is used to render in symbolic form shifting local and national identities. The author sets his work in the mostly imaginary town Mano Majra in the Northwest Frontier in the summer of 1947, when millions were forced to move to escape the burning intercommunal violence. Mano Majra exists as an "oasis of peace" until relations break down between Sikhs and Muslims as India moves into Independence and Partition. There is relative peace between villagers of different classes and religions, and Singh represents their commonality as they encounter an outsider from an urban area. The villagers all revere a sandstone slab that is the local deity (2), and they gather in the Sikh temple, where Meet Singh pre sides but even the Imam is welcome. The passing trains foster the collective identity. The sounds of the railway have made "Mano Majra very conscious of trains" (4); this consciousness structures the villagers' daily life. With the sound of the morning train the mullah begins the call to prayer, and, hearing that, the priest performs his ablutions. Even the local thieves orient their nightly raids by the timetable of the train. As this "railway time" be comes entrenched in daily life, it gives rise to an integrated local rail way consciousness. Just as the passing trains prompt the timetable of religious rituals, statements about the railway become substitutes for other kinds of interactions: "When the goods train steams in," the narrator tells us, the villagers "say to each other, 'There is the goods train.' It is like saying goodnight" (5). In Singh's representation, a rail way consciousness becomes embedded in local life, and local identity is articulated in terms of the railway. In the novel, time acts as an organizing structure to show the intermeshed quality of the local and the national; it also calls forth the paradigms of progress embodied by the temporality of the railway. The idea of the railway, which gave rise to the term "railway time," has often been represented as imposing a new temporality associated with modernity, a measured time that orders the social world around it (Schivelbusch 44). In Singh's novel, the railway timetable that orga nized the villagers' daily life begins to fluctuate as violence comes to Mano Majra:</page><page sequence="11">76 | MARIAN AGUIAR Some days it seemed as though the alarm clock had been set for the wrong hour. On others it was as if no one had remembered to wind it_ Goods trains had stopped running altogether, so there was no lullaby to lull them to sleep. Instead, ghost trains went past at odd hours between midnight and dawn, disturbing the dreams of Mano Majra. (77) If "railway time" signifies the nation, something is changing within the order of the nation itself. With the unsettling of the "lullaby" of the trains, the village is waking to its national identity?one that had remained latent, in the dream world of night trains, until now. The narrator marks a progressive degeneration that accompanies this con sciousness, as something mistaken (set for the wrong hour) or forgot ten becomes a thing "disturbing the dreams" of the village. This train has a haunted quality, a description that reverses the temporal orientation of the icon of the train. In transforming the image of the train, Singh disrupts the linearity of time that is central to the notion of modernity. The train, with its perpetual forward motion, functions as an emblem of progress, a concept often rendered in artis tic form through the image of the journey. The train is usually a sym bol of where it is going: the train's future is ahead down the tracks. Singh references this orientation through the character of Hakum Chand, who recalls Prime Minister Jahawarlal Nehru's famous speech at the moment of independence: "Long ago we made a tryst with des tiny and now the time comes when we shall redeem our pledge, not wholly or in full measure but very substantially" (Singh 176). Nehru's speech suggests the forward-looking paradigm of modernity. In the novel, however, the chief inspector remembers a man who killed his wife and children on a halted train to save them from dying of thirst: "He came to his tryst by train," Hakum Chand reflects with irony, "along with his wife and three children" (178). Singh shifts the gaze backward down the tracks, reversing the point of reference from future to past?the scene of death prior to the narrative. The ghost train as an image offers the same backward gaze to the collective massacre. In the novel, it is not only the temporality of the train that is altered but the temporality of modernity itself. The constitution of a retro actively cast identity created a different modern relationship to the present, one which did not only look forward but also turned to an imagined collective past. This past reemerged in new forms under the historical contingencies of the present. It is a communal past that is</page><page sequence="12">MAKING MODERNITY | 77 produced by this technology, rather than a transcendent secular future. We might read this reorientation of temporality in the imagery of the train, which fuses the mechanical image of the train to one that is both embodied and communal. In Train to Pakistan, the train begins to function as a metonym for the communal body; Singh reaches this effect through the image of the cyborg. As refugees push across the border by train, the trains become merged with the identities of their "cargo." Singh depicts the express train from Lahore?now in Pakistan?entering India: "Like all trains, it was full. From the roof, legs dangled down the sides onto the doors and windows. The doors and windows were jammed with heads and arms" (44). Singh represents the refugee train as a cross between a crowd and a machine?a cyborg body. Later in the novel, Singh de scribes another refugee train as having "solid crust of human beings" (180). In yet another image, the train stands in place of its passengers: All trains coming from Delhi stopped and changed their drivers and guards before moving on to Pakistan. Those coming from Pakistan ran through with their engines screaming with release and relief. (77) Singh displaces the mood of the passengers and engineer onto the train itself, which expresses relief as it crosses the borders. He recon ceptualizes the image of the train from a value-neutral vehicle to a fraught and embodied social space in the images of cyborg and per sonified machine. Previously a national symbol, the train now sym bolizes a communally coded vehicle, a caravan of Muslims traveling into Pakistan or of Sikhs and Hindus into India. It becomes the very bodies of those identities. When the first "death train" arrives over the border, "There was something uneasy about it. It had a ghostly quality" (78). The character of the train has changed from the instru ment of reason (the clock), to a cyborg body, to a specter. Singh invokes and recodes several narratives of the railway, and in doing so transforms the representational field of modernity. First, he alters a notion of time. The linear time that is a hallmark of the modern and emblematized by "railway time" becomes something irrational and uncanny. As Singh reverses the reader's gaze backward down the tracks toward the origin of the death train, he shifts tem poral orientation from future to immediate past. Singh's train to Pak istan that closes the novel returns the gaze toward the future, but the</page><page sequence="13">78 | MARIAN AGUIAR notion of the tryst with destiny has already been thoroughly critiqued. In the context of Partition, the very idea of this progress is called into question. Finally, Singh shifts from a mechanical vision of the train to first an anthropomorphic one and then an uncanny one, again bor rowing a counternarrative of technology to offset the rhetoric of colo nial modernity. The image of the ghost train appears repeatedly in Partition nar ratives, from Singh's novel to Deepa Mehta's film Earth. With the kinds of reversals that take place in this image, counternarratives within modernity?those that go against the colonial rhetoric of technology? are already available inside historical representations of the train. Remo Ceserani describes the uncanny train in the European context as sutur ing together competing social notions of industrial modernity as both devastating and progressive. Singh taps into this other narrative stream to render the contradictions inside modernity within his historical context. He revives the tropes of this counternarrative?the uncanny versus rational technology, the anthropomorphic versus the mecha nistic?to challenge the dominant narratives of modernity in the con text of Partition. PERMEABLE BOUNDARIES The spatialization of the railway highlights certain kinds of relation ships; this nexus pivots around the paradigm of inside and outside, one of the primary binaries constructing railway space. This split be tween inside and outside produces what Michel de Certeau calls "a closed and autonomous insularity," a fantasy that becomes important as the train travels through the back door of urban spaces many of the passengers would never walk through. Michel de Certeau describes the railway carriage as a "rational utopia" (110), and likens it to "a bubble of panoptic and classifying power, a module of imprisonment that makes possible the production of an order, a closed and auton omous insularity?that is what can traverse space and make itself independent of local roots" (111). The space of the railway promises the order of modernity; to be within the ordered ranks of the railway car is to be protected by the state and simultaneously the promise of modernity, a "rational utopia."</page><page sequence="14">MAKING MODERNITY | 79 The division between interior and exterior becomes mapped as a temporal schism: what is inside the train lies within a progressive narrative, while the outside does not. Anne McClintock describes this temporal order as the production of anachronistic space, which a priv ileged Western spectator sets outside of the space inside present time (40). McClintock depicts this binary as worked out through cartogra phy, but one may find a more immediate and proximate signification in the interior and exterior of the train. The voyeuristic possibilities offered by the structure of the railway carriage, with its elevated view of the world protected by a metal shell, mirrors the position of the colonizer who consumes that prehistory as passive nature. Here only one side is granted the role of spectator: to be inside the train is to be inside modern times, while the outside space hangs in the suspension of prehistory. The lines of demarcation that enable that exterior space to lie outside of time or to be inscribed as a historical antecedent have already been made, however; in fact they were enacted in the very construction of the railway that transformed that seemingly natural world. The division between interior and exterior space of the rail way becomes a concrete rearticulation, a continual reenactment and reinforcement, of hierarchies already in place. Combined, the image of the train as a national space and as one in which the interior was literally and metaphorically suspended above the outside local space were key to how the train became a site of violence during India's partition. The binary of inside and outside stands at the center of moder nity's rhetoric of exclusion and is charted in the representational space of the train. The boundaries of the train carriage mark interior from exterior; they also reference and divide national space inside from local space outside. Of course the train was never successfully disem bedded from the localities it traveled through. Although these spaces of inside and outside are marked as separate, the boundaries between them?and relations between their occupants?are more fluid than they initially appear. One need only think of the relationship between observing traveler and observed native, between threatening terrorist outside and vulnerable passenger confined to a carriage to reflect on an anxiety that points to this permeability of boundaries. The car riage might appear to be apart from the land it travels over and the passenger a distant observer of the outside world, yet they are part of</page><page sequence="15">80 | MARIAN AGUIAR both a national public space and a local space?and subject to its real ities. The violence on the railway during Partition exposes the perme ability of boundaries and thus the fallacy of this bifurcation. Khushwant Singh's view in Train to Pakistan is almost entirely from outside the train, but other Partition stories focus on the shift ing dynamics within the train carriage. Inside the modern space of the "death train," the convergence and renegotiation of the meanings that compose modernity were also thrown into relief. Bhisham Sahni's short story "We Have Arrived in Amritsar" presents a view of the fluid landscape of Partition from within the train itself. Like Train to Pakistan, "We Have Arrived in Amritsar" tells the story of a descent into violence. Violence initially appears as an omnipotent aura char acterizing an unseen exterior. As the train passes through troubled areas, it uses motion to outstrip its perceived vulnerability (Sahni 119). A key aspect of this story is the construction of the "rational utopia" of the railway carriage as a neutral space suspended from the vagaries of the outside (de Certeau 110). As things deteriorate within the rail way car, it becomes evident that the space of the carriage is not invio late. With a new awareness of the permeability of public space comes an increasing sense of vulnerability. Even though the carriage seems isolated, when viewed from the interior of the car (particularly when the blinds are pulled down), the train is also part of the outside spaces through which it rapidly travels. The dynamics governing that space also govern the interior. For example, a tangible sign of the violence materializes in the guise of a frantic Hindu man and his family flee ing something outside, perhaps a mob, with his trunk and cot. When the Pathan aims a kick at the man, and instead kicks the man's wife, the communal violence "outside" reveals itself to be within the com partment as well. The train dramatizes the geography of power in a way a fixed pub lic space cannot, for it is subject to both an interior order and a chang ing exterior order. The dynamic inside the car begins to shift based on the location of the train as the power balance of the towns through which the train travels is mirrored inside the seemingly detached space. The passengers mark the communal allegiances of towns they pass: Sahni describes how the Hindu and Sikh passengers tense and the Pathan passengers relax as they learn the ravaged town they have just passed was predominantly Muslim (Sahni 118). As the train moves</page><page sequence="16">MAKING MODERNITY | 81 east, the power of the majority changes hands, and the dynamics inside the railway car echo and reinforce these changes. After crossing the border, one Hindu man, previously teased and cowed, crashes an iron bar down on an unknown Muslim man (his religion identified by his idiom "In the Name of Allah"), as the man and his wife try to gain access to the moving train. The mobile geog raphy of power and the particular relationship between interior and exterior space enable this ironic turn of the Babu's character. A belea guered man suddenly gains authority as they pass over invisible space: he is supported by an imagined nation mapped with national and communal identities designating who has power where. The train car riage, despite the fact that it is set apart as a "neutral" space, repre sents the status of this outside world. By setting his story on a moving train, Sahni presents the dynam ics of mobile space, showing the permeable relationship between in side and the outside. His story offers a fluid geography of power, as the relation between interior and exterior space determine the rela tive power of Muslims, Sikhs, or Hindus. Sahni invokes a dominant narrative of the railway, the binary of inside and outside, that sym bolizes the tenants of modernity. But like Singh, he also brings in a counternarrative?the anxiety of the permeable boundary that lies at the heart of railway terror?and uses it to alter the imagination of modernity. Singh and Sahni represent another way Partition literature partic ulates modernity. Both authors' narratives play on the concept of an arrested journey, with Singh explicitly invoking Nehru's motif of a tryst with destiny as the endpoint of such a journey. The train is often depicted as the emblem of a forward-facing modernity, and the rail way journey as the symbol in a narrative of progress (Freeman 29); in colonial rhetoric, the train is cast as the ultimate symbol of devel opment. Yet South Asian Partition literature set on the train often undermines if not challenges the notion of progress. The period of Partition transforms the nature of that temporality; as both India and Pakistan gain national sovereignty, the image of the train journey changes from one of progress to one of perpetual reversal. The chang ing timeline of modernity appears in narrative in the form of a train that shuttles back and forth in violence and retribution rather than goes forward. The dynamic of the railway journey is thus a pendulum</page><page sequence="17">82 | MARIAN AGUIAR rather than a vector when the future down the tracks shows simply a reversal of fortune. This reversal confronts the notion of imminent transformation that lies at the heart of modernity's colonial narrative of transformation. The contemporary representation of the train in South Asian lit erature continues to question the associations of modernity in repre senting the period of Partition. Recent events have turned attention toward the opposition between the sacred and the secular, rethinking the binary between the two. Once again, the railway acts as a stand in for modernity, even as its representation also opens a space for reexamining what that means. Mukhul Kesavan's contemporary Par tition novel Looking through Glass, for example, uses the symbol of a railway station to render a complex relationship between the religious and the secular. In a climatic scene in the novel, Kesavan envisages a mosque set between the intersecting tracks of the railway. The pro tagonist glimpses the strangely situated mosque as he passes on an overbridge: It sat precisely between platforms one and two, so conspicuously out of place that it was almost invisible. It was, in fact, in plain sight of the over bridge?three lumpy, whitewashed domes, a little flattened by my point of view, and a tiny courtyard. From my elevation, I could see the bearded maulana and his congregation, bending and straightening in prayer. (188) The railway mosque fuses the sacred and the secular. "Skirling Ara bic sounds" of prayer call the narrator's attention to the mosque in a lull between trains; as a train arrives the opening words of prayer combine with the mechanical sounds of the engine, creating a aurally hybrid space. With this image of a mosque between railway platforms, the author locates religion within the dominant narratives of modernity. The coun ternarrative of modernity appears metaphorically in the interstitial space bound by the rigid structures of development. The mosque is not quite invisible, and its aural traces of a sacred ritual escape out to meld with the sounds of technology. The sacred and secular come together within the space of modernity. Kesavan's choice of a railway station recalls the close association between the train and the history of Partition; on a broader level, it taps into an even longer association between narratives of the train and modernity. Like Khushwant Singh</page><page sequence="18">MAKING MODERNITY | 83 and Bhisham Sahni, Kesavan chooses these very narratives to rewrite the dominant story of modernity. Kesavan's 1990s novel offers a lumi nous image of something embedded in much of the mid-twentieth century Partition literature, namely an invocation of technology to produce a counternarrative within modernity. Such a representational move flies in the face of contemporary rhetoric that, like the colonial and development discourse before it, places technology and cultural expressions in contrast, if not at odds. Partition literature offers insight into the function and reevalua tion that takes place inside of the rhetoric of modernity. In looking at modernity it is important to consider modernity's representational forms, for an analysis of these offers a way to move away from the conflations made by the rhetoric of modernity. Technology in partic ular acts as a metonym in the rhetorical function of modernity. Yet we can use this equivalent as a way to uncover the contradictions inside of modernity. To do this, it is first necessary to see technology as a kind of imaginary, one that actively remakes the narrative of moder nity rather than simply stands in its place as a self-evident signifier. What we find are a series of surprising representations of technology? images of nature, the uncanny, the embodied, the permeable bound ary. These are not to be seen as antimodernity; rather they are coun ternarratives of modernity, there from the very inception of railway technology, that reveal the complexities, contradictions, and fluidity of the modern made even more apparent as the concept moves across cultures and historical contexts.

Although several theorists have coupled the concepts of railways and modernity (Freeman 19; Carter 7; Kerr, "Representations" 288-89), the meaning of modernity alters slightly from critic to critic. In the rhetoric of the public sphere as well as in artistic representations, the railway appears as the embodiment of a modernity comprising a shifting set of criteria, including a rupture from the old social, spatial, and temporal structures (Freeman 27; Carter 8); capitalism (Bear 1); and an evolving national state (Kerr, "Representations" 289, note 5).</page><page sequence="19">84 | MARIAN AGUIAR Works Cited Aguiar, Marian.
