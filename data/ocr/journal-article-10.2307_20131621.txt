<plain_text><page sequence="1">HEGEL AND THE POLITICAL THEOLOGY OF RECONCILIATION MARK LILLA All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation. 2 Corinthians 5:18 The Hegelian philosophy is the last magnificent attempt to restore Christianity by identifying it with the negation of Christianity. Feuerbach ItIaN IS ALIENATED AND IN NEED OF RECONCILIATION. This idea is as old as human thought and appears in countless forms in the myths and religions that have come down to us. In these we learn how the cos mos?whether by necessity or chance?lost its original self-identity, experienced a division within itself, and passed this division down into the natural and human worlds. Man is alienated because the cos mos is alienated, and he will not be made whole until the One is re stored to itself. Whether the cosmos is fated to be reconciled, whether man must assist in bringing this about?on these matters opinions differ; but there is agreement across many traditions that man is estranged from his true being and must await a time when his wholeness will be restored. Among these traditions the Christian account of alienation and reconciliation is unique in several respects. Like orthodox Judaism it refuses to trace human alienation to a cosmic source and places re sponsibility instead squarely on the shoulders of sinful man. By will fully separating himself from God, man has made himself homeless in a world where he must now toil, govern himself, and suffer the conse quences of his fallen nature, until his death. Unlike Judaism, however, Christianity refuses to concede to fallen man the ability to expiate his sins through punctilious observation of the law and thereby reconcile himself to his God and his fellow man through his own efforts.

Repentance is a necessary condition of receiving grace, but it alone is insufficient to work a rec onciliation. Christianity teaches that unrepentant and untouched by grace, man has no power to overcome alienation. Yet once he does repent and joins the company of the faithful, man's collective power to work reconciliation in the world is great indeed?certainly greater than Ju daism imagined was possible through observance of the law. What is unique to Christianity is the conviction that Christendom is the uni versal agent for reconciliation in the world. It is this conviction that lies at the root of its theological-political problems. Beginning with the Church Fathers, Christianity posited itself as an unprecedented form of human community defined by the inner conviction of those belonging to it. Taken individually, each believing Christian is a pil grim in the world, awaiting reconciliation with God in the beyond; taken collectively, however, the community of believers founded by the Messiah has already achieved a measure of reconciliation within itself, and thus becomes an agent for reconciliation in the world. How the reconciliation achieved within Christendom compares eschatolog ically to the final redemption at the Second Coming, whether it is le gitimate to conceive of the City of God in political terms, how that City relates to temporal life?these are permanent problems of Chris tian theology and political thought.1 But however they have been re solved by Christian thinkers, the reconciling mission of Christendom has never come into question. Hegel was not a Christian thinker. His philosophy, however, is undeniably a philosophy of reconciliation, of Vers?hnung. No ac count of Hegelian dialectic or theory of history is adequate if it fails to reckon with the awkward fact that they are conceived in light of an ul timate Vers?hnung, a central term in Hegel's philosophical vocabu lary.2 Dialectic and history have their ends. This is why it has been suggested, not without reason, that Hegel and his epigones must be seen within the traditions of myth and pagan gnosticism that try to re lieve man's sense of alienation.3 But this alone is not sufficient. For when we examine Hegel's treatment of reconciliation we begin to no tice aspects of it that are not ancient or mythological, let alone mod ern. They are unmistakenly Christian. Above all, Hegel appears to ac xFor a classic and challenging account, see Etienne Gilson, Les m?ta morphoses de la Cit? de Dieu (Paris: Vrin, 1952).</page><page sequence="3">HEGEL AND POLITICAL THEOLOGY 861 cept the Christian doctrine that Christendom, the living community of believing Christians, plays a decisive role in bringing about the world's reconciliation with itself by universalizing the experience of spiritual reconciliation. To repeat: Hegel is not a Christian thinker. He rejects the Christian account of sin as the cause of human alienation and is si lent about Christian hopes for redemption in the afterlife. Yet when it comes to Christendom's role in the world, as a social body inspired by certain dogmas giving it a historical mission, Hegel concedes a central claim of the Christian faith: there can be no Vers?hnung in the world without the community of Christians.4 How significant is this concession? Throughout the nineteenth century no question seemed more momentous to Hegel's followers 2Until the publication of Michael O. Hardimon's Hegel's Social Philoso phy: The Project of Reconciliation (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994), this theme received little attention in anglophone Hegel scholarship. Unfortunately, Hardimon's single-minded focus on politics and what he calls Hegel's "social theodicy" (19-21), along with his indifference to strictly theo logical issues (see 85-7, 96), limit the usefulness of his study. More helpful in this regard are G?nther Rohrmoser's Subjectivit?t und Verdinglichung (G?tersloh: Mohn, 1961) and his "Die theologische Voraussetzungen der He gelschen Lehre vom Staat," Hegel-Studien 1 (1964): 239-45, as well as Peter Cornehl's Die Zukunft der Vers?hnung (G?ttingen: Van der Boeck und Ru precht, 1971). 3See, for example, Leszek Kolakowski's chapter on "The Origins of Dia lectic," in his Main Currents of Marxism (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1978), 1:7-80. 4Anglophone readers of Hegel will know from their translations that he makes frequent use of the technical term "reconciliation," which is the cor rect rendering of the German term Vers?hnung. What they may not realize is that the theme of reconciliation is absolutely central to the Protestant theo logical tradition, to which Hegel is making explicit reference. In his transla tion of the New Testament, Martin Luther consistently, and correctly, trans lated the Greek term katallag??which means "reconciliation," specifically the transformation of enmity into friendship?by the German Vers?hnung. The King James Version and many other English-language Bibles translate katallag? inconsistently, sometimes as "reconciliation," but more often as "atonement." The etymology of atonement is similar to that of Vers?hnung: it originally meant "at-one-ment." But over time atonement took on a different meaning in English, something closer to expiation: we say Christ atones for our sins. Hence, Protestant theology in the English-speaking world has put much less emphasis on the reconciling ministry of Christ than have German Protestants, for whom the reunification of the divine and human is a central doctrine. On the translation of katallag? see Richard Chenevix Trench, Syn onyms of the New Testament (Grand Rapids: Baker Book House, 1989), 305 7, and The Interpreter's Dictionary of the Bible, vol. 1 (New York: Abingdon Press, 1962), 309-10.</page><page sequence="4">862 MARK LILLA and critics alike than the relation of his philosophical science to the doctrines of Christianity. For them, it was crucial to determine whether that science was an apology for Christianity's role in history and the modern world, or whether, on the contrary, it was intended as a systematic declaration of independence from religion. Today such debates?among left- and right-Hegelians, liberal and orthodox theo logians?strike us as hopelessly archaic and irrelevant to assessing Hegel's philosophical achievement, which is thought to lie anywhere but in his philosophy of religion or appraisal of Christianity; but per haps it is time for this revisionist appreciation of Hegel to be revised. The question is not whether Hegel looked favorably or unfavorably on Christianity (he did both), or whether his experience with the Chris tianity of his time distorted his views of religious experience or of modern life. The issue is whether Hegel accepted the reconciling claims of Christianity on philosophical grounds and, if so, what role those claims play in his mature philosophical system. An investigation of these questions has implications well beyond the interpretation of the Hegelian philosophy. As suggested above, the Christian doctrine of reconciliation is a theological doctrine which has had tremendous impact on the political existence of Christendom, and therefore on the political existence of nations and continents wherever Christians are to be found. It is perhaps the closest Chris tianity comes to having a pure theological-political doctrine. What de serves to be studied is the degree to which Hegel's own philosophy of reconciliation reproduces the many theological-political problems of Christian thought, whether it resolves them, or whether in the end it compounds them. I Eros. Hegel's theory of religion was made possible by Kant's. Like Kant (and Rousseau) Hegel considered the human religious im pulse to be the expression of a natural, erotic yearning for something elevated; since only man is capable of religious feeling, he reasoned, religion obviously expresses something unique to him that distin guishes him from the animals.5 In his early fragmentary writings He gel even employed Kant's vocabulary to describe a religious impulse arising out of the "needs of practical reason" (which, according to the critical philosophy, are rational not impulsive). Yet even after aban</page><page sequence="5">HEGEL AND POLITICAL THEOLOGY 863 doning such formulations Hegel continued to follow Kant in insisting on the fundamentally moral, rather than merely cognitive, significance of religion, and for that very reason also sought a dignified homeo pathic satisfaction to man's religious need.6 Here the similarities end. As Hegel's theory of religion developed in the period leading up to the Phenomenology of Spirit he did not re nounce the Kantian conception of eros so much as extend it beyond the faculty of reason to the whole of man's mental and emotional life. From a Kantian standpoint this reflects an abandonment of the critical philosophy and a regression to Rousseau's strictly psychological con ception of religious sentiment. Yet by the time Hegel writes the Phe nomenology it is clear that he has rejected Kant's critical/psychologi cal distinction and is searching for a vocabulary to express how the whole of man?his feelings, consciousness, self-consciousness, rea son, spirit?is animated by a single erotic force that gives rise to man's religious need and tries to satisfy it. This ambition to account for the thoroughgoing eroticism of hu man being eventually transforms Hegel's conception of homo 5 Enzyklop?die der philosophischen Wissenschaften im Grundrisse (hereafter, "Encyclopedia") in Werke, ed.

We recall that for Kant the problem of satisfying the religious need was essentially a static one. In the fa mous image of the Critique of Pure Reason, man stands on an island whose shores demark the limits of his faculties, tempted by sirens born out of his own reason to hazard the rocky waters of metaphys ics. So long as he is under the "transcendental illusion" he cannot re sist this temptation and so finds himself tossed about by the winds of dogmatic religion. Kant thought he had shattered this illusion once and for all by discovering reason's speculative limits and the exist ence of "regulative Ideas," and he was convinced that if man accepted the postulates of rational moral religion he could live contentedly on his island. That religion would satisfy his legitimate moral need for hope and justification while simultaneously rechanneling his erotic drive into the improvement of self and society. Hegel could not imagine how the needs of the whole man as ex pressed in religion could possibly receive one-time satisfaction. For what man seeks in religion, he thought, is full reconciliation with life, which presents itself to him as an irreducibly dynamic force. Even in his earliest works Hegel struggles to describe this dynamism, whose laws he eventually derives in his mature Logic and Encyclopedia.1 We are familiar with how this dynamic force is eventually tamed for phi losophy in the dialectic of consciousness. What deserves to be recog nized is how, from the very first, Hegel links it to man's perpetual exis tential dissatisfaction with his division (Entzweiung) from the wholeness of life, and how this dissatisfaction gives rise to the prob lem of religion. Agape. The weakest link in Kant's moral theory, which also weakens his theory of religion, is that of psychological motivation: how can a rational ground of moral action (Bewegungsgrund) also be 7 In the early writings he already writes that "the Absolute itself is the identity of identity and nonidentity; being opposed and being one are both to gether in it" (Nohl, 348), and in the Differenz essay he elaborates on this point: "life eternally forms itself by setting up oppositions, and totality at the highest pitch of living energy is only possible through its own reestablish ment out of the deepest fission," or again, "life is the union of union and non union."

Kant felt it neces sary to show that the moral law necessarily generates its own incen tive, so he could deny any psychological function to heteronomous re ligion in the economy of moral life. His argument is less than convincing, and in the end he is driven to concede that even if the moral law alone can spur law-abidingness, it gives insufficient motiva tion to pursue the highest good as an ultimate moral end. For that one needs to accept a minimal rational-moral faith. The young Hegel finds this reasoning psychologically implausible. "However scrupulously a system of morality may require us to sepa rate in abstracto pure morality from sensuality and make the latter more subservient to the former," he writes, "we must make equally full allowance for man's sensuality," adding that "it is altogether unlikely that humankind, or even a single individual, will ever in this world be able to dispense entirely with nonmoral promptings."8 This is not a merely "realistic" objection to moral "idealism"; it reflects Hegel's view about the importance of man's experience with Entzweiung and its moral repercussions. The problem of moral motivation is rooted ultimately in the discord man feels externally with the forces of life and internally between the forces of his head and heart. One cannot expect men to act morally so long as they feel divided, nor can one ex pect them to give up religions that offer reconciliation. "The need to unite subject with object, to unite feeling, and feeling's demand for ob jects, with the understanding, to unite them in something beautiful, in a god, is the supreme need of the human spirit and the urge to reli gion."9 Religion should not be considered an unfortunately necessary supplement to moral autonomy, let alone a barrier to it. Man is natu rally religious because he is in some deep sense naturally moral and feels the need to reconcile the forces at work in life so that he can re alize his morality.10 Kant's moral religion might be expected to satisfy the needs of practical reason as Kant conceives them but it cannot hope to recon cile the head and heart, which Hegel considers our foremost moral need. In his early writings he therefore distinguishes between objec tive religion as a matter of the mind (fides quae creditur, faith in which one believes) and subjective religion capable of reaching the 8 Nohl, 4,18. 9 Nohl, 332, translation modified. io Nohl, 9.</page><page sequence="8">866 MARK LILLA feeling heart (fides qua creditur, faith with which one believes). He also maintains that the latter being decisive, the important moral task is to render objective religion subjectively valid.11 The moral problem as Kant sees it, namely, the problem of reconciling rational morality with rational religion, is thereby transposed by the young Hegel into the religious problem of reconciling two kinds of faith. This transposition addressed the issue of moral motivation, though at the cost of raising Kant's primary objection to dogmatic reli gion, its moral heteronomy. Hegel is concerned about heteronomy as well, though as a problem of psychology rather than of principle. This is what he is referring to when he discusses the phenomenon of posi tivity. The young Hegel has acquired a reputation as a critic of posi tive religion that is only half-merited. While it is true that the aim of his early theological writings is to analyze and criticize the transfor mation of Christianity from a subjectively valid religion of the heart into a dead set of imposed dogmas, he also maintains that it is impos sible to establish in principle what constitutes positivity. In an impor tant passage he rejects the opposition of positive to natural or rational religion as insufficiently psychological. What counts is that religion and the changing nature of man's needs?"the nature of [religion's] time," Hegel calls it?be brought into sync so that religion continues to motivate.12 If the authoritative doctrines of a culture satisfy the subjective needs of the heart they will not be taken to be positive, and therefore are not. Even at this early stage in his thinking Hegel sees religion's legitimacy as depending on history rather than on its ratio nal character or nearness to a primitive condition.13 Still, the threat of positivity is real. Religion arises because man feels himself divided; he hears the call of the infinite but does not know how to harmonize it with his own finitude. Religion can do that by making morality that is objectively valid also subjectively vital to him. Yet any religion risks reopening that very cleavage by abandon ing the language of the heart for the soulless dictates of universal laws, which will alienate even if they are the self-legislated rules of Kantian morality. The question then becomes: can religion be re formed in such a way that it will retain its subjective power while re 11 In the early writings he ascribes this task to the state. See Nohl, 6-11, 48-9. 12 Nohl, 141.</page><page sequence="9">HEGEL AND POLITICAL THEOLOGY 867 maining objectively valid? Or must a substitute for religion be found, one capable of delivering the permanent reconciliation man seeks? This question lies at the root of all Hegel's reflection on religion, philosophy, and politics, down through the mature system of the En cyclopedia. We must, however, distinguish between two answers he gives to it. The first, developed in his early fragmentary writings, is that such a reconciliation can only be found in a folk religion of love based on Christ's original gospel message. The second, which became a presupposition of the mature system, is that reconciliation is brought about naturally in human history through the coordinated de velopment of religion, philosophy, and political life. To understand fully the significance of this more encompassing reconciliation we must first understand what Hegel eventually found to be lacking in Christianity. The essence of Christianity is love, agape, which Hegel considers a spontaneous moral impulse capable of unifying all that is divided. It is not a quality of the understanding (Verstand), which distinguishes through opposition; nor is it a quality of reason (Vernunft), which re stricts and universalizes. "In love," Hegel writes, "life is present as a duplicate of itself and as a single unified self."14 Kant was incapable of understanding the power of love, so convinced was he of the neces sary tension between reason and feeling, law and inclination; he even mocked the commandments dictating love for God and neighbors. He could not hear what was new in the Sermon on the Mount, its revela tion of the supramoral power of love. Hegel admits that strictly speak ing love cannot be a duty, if only because in love all thought of duty 13 Some religions, however, are intrinsically or merely positive and can never hope to satisfy man's subjective needs. This is the young Hegel's view of Judaism, and here he follows Kant rather closely. In the fragment titled "The Spirit of Christianity and its Fate" he contrasts the alienating heteron omy of Jewish law to the natural, reconciling religion of the Greeks (Nohl, 243-60). Whatever unity men in Palestine once must have felt with them selves, others, and nature was destroyed once and for all by Abraham, a dis loyal man who left his community unprovoked and set out to make the Jews into masters of nature by separating them from other races and placing them under the mastery of a single, distant God. The spirit of Judaism is positivity, which was codified by Moses in his slavish commandments that made the Jewish people slavish and prone to messianic fancy. Like Macbeth, Hegel writes in one of his cruelest sentences, the Jews sundered themselves from nature which has now taken its revenge on them. For Hegel's mature defense of Christianity's positive character, see Religion 3:179-88. 14 Nohl, 379.</page><page sequence="10">868 MARK LILLA vanishes, as does the opposition of law and inclination. A "righteous ness of a new kind" replaces virtue, and all thought of right with it.15 In his break with Christianity Kant fell back into the cold positivity of Jewish law, which renders difficult any reconciliation. Against heter onomous subjection to external laws, Kant preached self-subjection to universal law. Jesus instead preached obedience through love, and virtue as a modification of that love. "Love itself pronounces no im perative. It is no universal opposed to a particular, no unity of the concept, but a unity of spirit, divinity. To love God is to feel one's self in the 'all' of life, with no restrictions, in the infinite."16 What Hegel in these early writings sees in the Christian principle of love is a source of psychological and social reconciliation. A reli gion based on it would unite feeling and reflection, bringing men to gether through mutual recognition and ultimately helping them see the divinity within themselves?as Hegel already puts it, to see them selves as modifications of the Godhead.17 Social reconciliation, how ever, would only be possible if such a religion were also a Volksreli gion, that is, a popular national religion. This is where Christian love has its limitations. Hegel lays out the conditions of an ideal folk reli gion in one of his earliest fragments, the so-called T?bingen Essay, where the model is an imaginary Greece. In Hegel's view, for a reli gion to be a folk religion it must satisfy three conditions: it must re flect universal reason, it must engage the heart, and it must be bound up with public life.18 Christian love clearly satisfies the first two con ditions but not necessarily the third. Greek folk religion was at home in the city and supported its freedom; it was celebrated in guiltless bacchanalic revels, and the gods followed the citizens into the mar ketplace, taking part in their games. The Christian religion, even as preached by Christ himself, turned its back on the City of Man so it could prepare citizens for the City of God. The roots of Christianity's political weakness can be traced his torically to the Judaism it overcame. Since the Jews to whom he was sent had been made slavish by their positive religion and were unable to respond to Christ's religion of love, he was forced to present him self as the divine Messiah and perform miracles. His first disciples 15 Nohl, 267-9. 16 Nohl, 296; 282-3, 288, 290-3. 17 Nohl, 302; 313, 315, 318; 322. 18 Nohl, 20.</page><page sequence="11">HEGEL AND POLITICAL THEOLOGY 869 were drawn from the same Jewish population, and while devoted to their Messiah they promoted his religion as if it were a positive one, proselytizing the gentiles of Europe and "emptying Valhalla."19 Chris tianity finally succeeded in extinguishing all competing folk religions and turning itself into an empire, but from the beginning it was a pecu liar one. Although it wished to convert the world, it did not know if it wished to govern it. The principle of love was meant to work an inner, spiritual transformation of man; it was not promulgated by Christ as a political principle. Even the virtues and habits of friendship which grew up in the Apostolic period and are still cherished by the churches quickly became inappropriate in the public life of an empire.20 When Christianity transformed itself into the empire of Christen dom it prevented itself from ever becoming a genuine folk religion. Brought into the world to heal all the cleavages of human existence it simply reproduced them within itself, becoming the locus of Christian man's new religious problem: Between these extremes of the multiple or diminished consciousness of friendship, hate or indifference toward the world, between these ex tremes which occur within the opposition between God and the world, between the divine and life, the Christian church has oscillated to and fro, but it is contrary to its essential character to find peace in a nonper sonal living beauty. And it is its fate that church and state, worship and life, piety and virtue, spiritual and worldly action, can never dissolve into one.21 Negativity. Among the many changes that took place in Hegel's thinking in the years leading up to the Phenomenology was a new in terpretation of the erotic sources of religious faith and how they might be satisfied. This interpretation would shed a new and far more favor able light on the social practice of religion in history, including Chris tian practice. In the early theological writings Hegel portrays the existential rift between thought and being, between infinity and human finitude, as fully bridgeable only by religion as a way of life. His reasoning was that ordinary human reflection is unable to overcome the breach 19 Nohl, 158-66,215. 20 Nohl, 322-4; 39-44; 173-83. Hegel lays much of the blame on Christ himself, who overreacted to Jewish positivity by appealing to a freedom of the heart untamed by law. In his wish to end terrestrial man's alienation from heaven, Jesus transported him to a heavenly city of the future, thus alienating him from this world (Nohl, 322-31). 21 Nohl, 342.</page><page sequence="12">870 MARK LILLA between itself and its object, while religion in principle can do this.22 But by the 1801 Difference essay Hegel already begins to suggest that the human mind alone might have this power because Entzweiung, though felt in the heart, is fundamentally a product of thought. There is a nearly complete transformation in Hegel's philosophical vocabu lary at this point, though the problem he is struggling with remains that of human self-division. He now describes it in terms of man's re lation to the "Absolute." In every human culture people sense that the Absolute is separated from its appearances and they seek to bridge the gap. Yet as they do so they build up partial and opposed notions of what the Absolute is?soul and body, freedom and necessity? which they mistake for the whole. The more they strive to reconcile these aspects of the Absolute, Hegel surmises, the further they are re moved from it. As cultures develop, these false or partial antitheses proliferate, intensifying man's sense of alienation and giving rise to the need for philosophy (Bed?rfnis der Philosophie). The sole inter est of reason, Hegel now claims, is to unite all these partial opposi tions: "to posit being in non-being, as becoming; to posit Entzweiung in the Absolute, as its appearance; to posit the finite in the infinite, as life."23 The task of ultimate reconciliation now falls to philosophy, not religion: "it is thinking that both inflicts the wound and heals it again."24 But not all thinking and philosophy is therapeutic, and there is the rub. In the preface to the Phenomenology Hegel catalogues the ways in which contemporary modes of thought failed to reconcile hu man existence, from the Romantics' search for a direct, ecstatic en counter with the Absolute, to the idealists' formulation of a lifeless identity between subject and object. Against the Romantics Hegel in 22 Nohl, 347-8. ^Difference, 13-16. Later Hegel described the "need for philosophy" as "thinking remaining faithful to itself by willingly negating its immediate rela tion to its objects in order to understand itself; it makes itself willingly home less "so that it may overcome" (a reference to Romans 3:4). Just as we un gratefully eat the food for which we first give thanks, so thinking ungratefully negates what it is given so that it might live. See Encyclopedia, ??11-12.

Man's own sense of division and alienation may be exacerbated by illusion, but it rests on a fundamentally correct intuition that the Absolute is a dy namically charged tension. "The Absolute is the identity of identity and non-identity; being opposed and being one are both together in it."25 The preface to the Phenomenology puts us on the way to thinking in a genuinely philosophical manner about the Absolute by remarking two of its essential features. The first is that the Absolute is both "sub stance" and "subject" simultaneously, which can only mean that it is the human mind, or Spirit.26 The second is that the force dynamizing this living substance is the subject's power of negativity (Negativit?t). Negativity is the ghost in the machine of consciousness, an inverted erotic force that causes division by negating all simple union, and then reestablishes a more complex union by negating this negation, "sublat ing" it. Negativity is the ultimate source of human alienation and recon ciliation; it is eros and agape at once. It is also the reason why the Ab solute presents itself to us in experience as a process of development, of becoming, rather than as a given result: because the Absolute al ways appears in mediated form we cannot grasp that it is "nothing be yond self-moving self-sameness," a "disporting of Love with itself," "the activity of self-manifesting."27 Spirit is bold. It does not shrink from death, it stares negativity in the face and tarries with it, aware that "the negative is the magical power that converts it into being.28 Ignorant of the fecundity of the negative, philosophy before Hegel wished to be spared this labor; it convinced itself that the acquisition of truth is something easy, a minted coin ready to be pocketed. It could not, or would not, see that "only this self-restoring sameness, or this reflection in otherness within itself?not an original or immediate unity as such?is the 25 Difference, 63-4.

For only at the end of that path does spirit come to know itself; only then does philosophy become science, and thought and being become united as one.31 Philosophy of religion. The Phenomenology marks the point in Hegel's thought and writing where philosophy acquires full title as the reconciler of man, to which religion is hereafter subordinated. Yet this subordination also represents religion's elevation to the position of philosophy's permanent helpmeet. For even philosophy as Hegel conceives it, as a science of absolute knowing, has its limitations. There are two important limitations of philosophy and together they imply a continuing need for religion. The first is that while phi losophy is the noblest form of therapy for those seeking reconcilia tion, few are willing to accept its rigors: "scientific cognition is a par ticular type of the consciousness of truth, and not everyone, indeed only a few men, undertake the labor of it." Religion, on the other hand, can minister to every soul since it is "the mode, the type of con sciousness, in which the truth is present for all men, or for all levels of education."32 Fortunately for man, truth appears in manifold and vari ous ways, which means that "it is not required that for all of humanity the truth be brought forth in a philosophical way."33 A second limita tion is that philosophy does not change the world and so cannot be expected to rationalize it, thereby bringing reason indirectly to those deaf to its call. Painting its gray in gray, philosophy comes upon transformations of the world after they have lost their vitality, and even then is incapable of making objective truths subjectively valid to non-philosophers.34 This work must still fall to religion.

Religion's subordination/incorporation within Hegel's mature phi losophy is only possible on the basis of his new account of human striving as negativity. Negation is the cause of the Entzweiung we ex perience and try to overcome in religion and philosophy, and negation is omnipresent in the life of spirit. Therefore, the problem of religion is omnipresent. This is confirmed in the introduction to the chapter on religion in the Phenomenology, which must be considered Hegel's golden sentences on the subject. There he reveals that religion as con sciousness of the Absolute has been present at every stage of spirit's phenomenological journey, which implies that "spirit in its own world and spirit conscious of itself as spirit, or spirit in religion, are the same."35 But for that identity to be actualized, the final Entzweiung, which we represent to ourselves as the division between God and man, must be overcome. When it is, religion is perfected and philoso phy as science becomes possible. The perfection of religion is there fore the condition of the possibility of philosophy's perfection; and since philosophy is the ultimate reconciler of man, religion's perfec tion is also the condition of complete reconciliation. Thus any philos ophy that pretends to the status of absolute knowing has no choice but to make religion its object, to study scientifically what it is and what would constitute its perfection. Hegel undertakes this scientific task in the Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion (hereafter, "Reli gion") given in the decade before his death. II Cultus. In his early writings the solution Hegel put forward to the problem of human Entzweiung was the development of a subjectively valid folk religion of love. In the Religion lectures this folk religion re appears as the cultus and is described as the locus of the three-step historical process: negation, Entzweiung, and reconciliation. While 35 At Phenomenology, 498-500 (pars. 678-80) Hegel explains that reli gion makes its appearance outside of time in the moments of consciousness, self-consciousness, and reasons, and within time only in the realm of spirit, when it appears as a temporal series of religions corresponding to a series of spiritual shapes.</page><page sequence="16">874 MARK LILLA the Phenomenology helped to explain why consciousness in search of reconciliation is led to, and then beyond, religion, only in the Religion lectures do we discover that the cultus in its truth actually is the very spirit of national life. Hegel's Religion begins with an analysis of the concept of reli gion, which is defined as the relation between man and God. Our knowledge of God first presents itself to us as something immediate: man knows God immediately, even if he does not know what God is or what it means to know him. Even without the evidence of reason or the senses he is as subjectively certain of God's existence as he is of his own.36 But once consciousness becomes aware of itself, be comes self-conscious, it begins to feel a need to ground this knowl edge in thought. Hegel sees the philosophers' proofs of God's exist ence (allegedly refuted by Kant) to be the highest expression of the prescientific attempt to understand the religious relation and to rise through mere thought from the human to the divine.37 This ascension is purely theoretical, however. It offers us knowl edge of God at the price of forgetting ourselves. For us to know our selves knowing God we must enter a different sort of relation with the divine, a practical one in which we act and will as living, free crea tures. Such a relation is only possible within the cultus. The mature Hegel rejects the notion, popularized by religious Romantics like Schleiermacher and Jacobi (and the young Hegel), that a purely im mediate relation with the divine is the highest form of that relation. It is not. "The heart and feeling that directly sense the truth of religion are not the heart and feeling of an animal but of a thinking being; they are a thinking heart [denkendes Herz] and a thinking feeling [denk endes Gef?hl]."^ Like all knowledge religious knowledge is both im mediate and mediate, but is always first experienced through the me diation of a living revealed religion. Such a religion cannot mechanically produce religious knowledge; on this, Schleiermacher and Jacobi (and the young Hegel) are right. Yet the cultus is always the necessary stimulus to religion since only in cultic life can we learn to make explicit our implicit knowledge of God. As spirit we are al ready implicitly reconciled with God; through the life of the cultus that reconciliation is enlivened and explicitly consummated. The cul 36Religion 1:70-2, 279, 281-4.

For it is only through the cultus that individuals discover their ends and thus be come social creatures. The cultus is also a form of acting and hence there is a goal [ Zweck] in it; the goal that it involves is the inwardly concrete totality of the natural and the spiritual. The object of faith is the goal of the cultus.... Its pur pose is real, it is absolute reality in and for itself, though it is not straight-away that this purpose is to be brought to account. Rather [the first step] that has to be accomplished in the cultus is to bring it about that the goal should be actual in me. The cultus is thus practical, in that the purpose is to be realized in me in opposition to me and my particular subjectivity, this subjectivity is the covering that must be stripped away, so that I may be filled by the spirit and this object may be in me as spiri tual.40 This process of incorporation into cultic life is not carried out by force or fear. Men are drawn together through pleasure to experience the reconciliation of man with man, and of man with God, that already ex ists implicitly. The ancient rituals of song and dance, sacrifice and worship, are all means of reenacting the reconciliation of spirit with it self while simultaneously animating the life of the nation. A nation is only as strong as the cultus that binds its people to it and reconciles them with each other. The cultus presupposes the certainty that reconciliation has been im plicitly accomplished... this reconciliation is assumed to be a unity that either has existed from the outset or is restored, and has to be restored, following a rupture. The national spirit [Nationalgeist] of each people is its protective deity [Schutzgott], with whom it knows itself in original unity. . . . Thus the cultus affords individuals their highest reciprocal guarantee; on it the happiness of the different peoples rests; if they ne glect it, evil ensues, individuals recede into their own private conscious ness, and the whole edifice falls asunder.41 39Religion 1:81, 302-7, 330-3. 40 Religion 1:249. ^Religion 1:358-9, 333-4.

Sibree's translation, The Philosophy of History (New York: Colo nial Press, 1899).</page><page sequence="18">876 MARK LILLA The nexus of national life is therefore the cultus, where the work of reconciliation is carried out. Hegel portrays this work as double sided. From the human side the cultus guides man's subjective rise from the finite to the infinite by shaping him morally through the na tion's Sitten and offering him representations of the divine which he is not prepared to understand philosophically. It thus offers social and psychological assistance in the rise of subjective spirit to the Ab solute.42 From the divine side the national cultus is the locus of God's objective reconciliation with his creatures and with himself, for as He gel reminds us, "God is not envious."43 By nature God as objective spirit must reveal himself to creation because he is creation, and must know himself in it: "his self-knowledge is a self-consciousness in man and man's knowledge of God, which proceeds to man's knowledge in God."44 The philosophy of religion is a systematic account of this dou ble reconciliation. But for any genuine reconciliation of the nation to take place there must first be the experience of negativity and Entzweiung. While the young Hegel held out hope for a restoration of national unity through the naive immediacy of a folk Christianity, the mature Hegel sees that every dimension of Spirit?logical, natural, human?is necessarily dynamized by an enriching negativity and alienation. This is especially so in religion, where "the deepest need of spirit is that the antithesis within the subject itself should be intensified to its univer sal, i.e., its most abstract extreme."45 The cultus must be tested by the fires of negativity if it is to bring men genuine reconciliation within their nations, and that testing takes place in history. History, there fore, is the history of reconciliation through religion. This central claim of Hegel's Religion appears banal, given that Hegel equates history as such with the history of every form of spirit: art, religion, philosophy, science, morals, and the state. Yet among these, two forms take precedence because they establish the social setting within which all the other forms can develop: religion and the state. In his lectures on world history Hegel famously proclaimed the state to be the vessel of world-spirit in history; less famously, he also ^Religion 1:291-8; compare Phenomenology, 579 (par. 794). ^Religion 1:278-9. 44Encyclopedia, ?556. ^Religion 3:233.</page><page sequence="19">HEGEL AND POLITICAL THEOLOGY 877 maintained that religion provides the cultural foundations for the state's historical development. The universal that manifests itself in the state and is known in it?the form which is to include all that is?comprises the culture [Bildung] of a nation, taken together. The specific content, however, which takes on the form of universality and which inheres in the concrete actuality that is the state, is the spirit of the people itself. . . . But man must know of this spirit of his, as his own essence, and create for himself the con sciousness of his own unity with it, a unity that is fundamental. For we said that the ethical is the union of the subjective and the universal will. Spirit, however, must come to an explicit consciousness of this union, and the center-point of such knowing is religion. . . . Religion is the place wherein a people gives itself the definition of what it holds to be true.... Thus the representation of God constitutes the general founda tion of a people.46 In the Encyclopedia the conclusion Hegel drew from this reasoning was that the history of religion and that of the state are in fact one, and therefore that their interaction must serve as the foundation of any philosophy of world history. The philosophy of religion has to discover the logical necessity in the progress by which the being, known as the absolute, assumes fuller and firmer features; it has to note to what particular feature the kind of cul tus corresponds?and then to see how the secular self-consciousness, the consciousness of what is the supreme vocation of man?in short how the nature of a nation's moral life, the principle of its law, of its ac tual liberty, and of its constitution, as well as of its art and science, cor responds to the principle which constitutes the substance of a religion. That all these elements of a nation's actuality constitute one systematic totality, that one spirit creates and informs them, is a truth on which fol lows the further truth that the history of religions coincides with world history.47 The preparation of the gospel. The bulk of Hegel's Religion is given over to an account of the history of determinate (bestimmte) re ligions and how their development through the experience of negativ ity?from the orient, though Greece, then Rome?prepared the human spirit for the revelation of Christianity, which is the consummate (vol lendete) religion. Yet since, as we have just seen, the history of reli gion coincides with that of the state, this is also an account of the preparation of the modern state, seen from the theological-political standpoint of the cultus. 46 Philosophy of History, 69-71; 55 (Introduction, 52-3; 41). Compare Religion 1:345-7. 47Encyclopedia, ?562.</page><page sequence="20">878 MARK LILLA In Religion, as in the Philosophy of History, the orient is pre sented as a realm of political theocracies that practiced nature reli gions. By "nature religion" Hegel does not mean natural religion or the worship of external nature. The term refers to man's immediate, naive experience with the spiritual, which reflects his implicit union with God and corresponds to the immediacy of oriental political rule.48 Hegel believes that morality in the oriental world was substan tial and lacking in subjectivity, and that there were no distinctions be tween the Kingdom of God and that of the rulers, the latter having been divinized.49 These theocracies took different forms?in China and India, primarily?depending on how the divine-human relation was understood.50 It was with the Persian religion of Zoroaster and the Egypt worship of Osiris, Hegel surmises, that man began to see in the divine a principle (the good) and bestowed subjectivity upon him, thus beginning the move out of natural political religion.51 The second stage of pre-Christian political religion is the Greeks', which was a religion of beauty. By beauty Hegel here means a spiri tual moment beyond the merely natural when human subjectivity be gins to assert its lordship (Herrschaft) over the finite aspects of con sciousness and the physical world. A beautiful nation is thus one that expresses the individuality of its national spirit in its culture (the sub jective artwork), in religion (the objective one), and in the state (the absolute work of art).52 The relations among these three aspects of Greek life were fundamentally harmonious, for there was no alien ation, no Entzweiung between citizen and political law. This ethical people "knew its state and the actions of the state to be the will and the achievement of its own self." This unity was then celebrated in ev ery aspect of Greek culture, from rituals and sacrifice to the plastic arts, poetry and drama, and even sports and war.53 The Greek gods were the first to be anthropomorphic, though they still remained somewhat under the impress of nature; they were a nosegay of divini ties, powerful but ultimately ruled by a fate they could not control.54 Thus, although the Greeks considered their state to be an indepen 48Religion 2:422-6. 49Philosophy of History, 143 (112). 50Religion 2:433-9, 445-54, 458^66, 475-98; Philosophy of History, 152 68, 177-203 (120-33, 141-62); Philosophy of Right, ?355. ^Religion 2:516, 527; Philosophy of History, 245-71 (198-219). ^Religion 2:532-3; Philosophy of History, 275-95 (225-40). ^Phenomenology, 525-9 (pars. 720-6).</page><page sequence="21">HEGEL AND POLITICAL THEOLOGY 879 dent artwork, they were unable to recognize the freedom of individu als within it, and this proved its greatest political limitation. Rome, the third and final stage of pre-Christian political religion, achieved what Greece could not. It found a way to develop and recon cile the principles of individualism in the law and universality in the reach of the empire; but in so doing Rome destroyed the principle of unity that had effortlessly guided the Greeks on their way, and turned itself into a theological-political monstrosity. Greek subjectivity and individuality pertained to the ethical community, the Gemeinwesen with which each Greek felt at one. Roman law recognized the subjec tivity of classes and individuals, and in this way fostered a perpetual state of civil war. Rome was not a moral unity, Hegel believes; it could only be held together by conquest and discipline. Although its system of law held the structure of the state together, its formality meant that it was thoroughly positive and evoked no subjective feeling of attach ment in the hearts of Roman citizens.55 The larger and more complex the empire grew, the less spiritual sustenance it could offer. Individ ual Romans acquired legal personality (Rechtzustand) and formal equality but lost the sense of self that accompanies genuine personal ity, and so began a fruitless search for comfort in stoicism, which drove them to skepticism, and thence to a state of unhappy conscious ness. Hegel's picture of Roman life is that of a chaos of isolated indi viduals, alienated from themselves and others, an empire permeated by an atmosphere of destitution.56 The sadness of Rome was reflected and cultivated by its political religion, which Hegel calls one of expediency or purposiveness (Zweckm??igkeit). Here the gods are no longer symbols of the com munity's subjection to fate, they are the state's own cynical creations, meant to further its purposes. The Roman state called upon its own gods, Fortuna Publica and Jupiter Capitolinus, to secure its aims, while leaving individual Romans to choose for themselves which of the mundane dieties crowding the Pantheon they wished worship. Po litical religion and the needs of individual faith had never before been so utterly opposed. The more the empire grew, the more alien deities were tolerated, and the worse this split became.

Liber ated as individuals, its citizens were overwhelmed by the changeabil ity of human things and despaired of any connection with the un changing, whether in themselves, in the world, or beyond it. To the degree that determinate religion, driven by negativity, is the religion of estrangement, Rome was its culmination?and therefore the place where the need for reconciliation would be most acutely felt. It was at the peak of the empire's power, therefore, that the time became ripe for God to send his son.58 Ill Annunciation. Now the Messiah has come. In Him the long sought reconciliation of Spirit with itself becomes possible and the history of religion?and therefore history as such?can draw to a close. Yet the Messiah who arrived was not the one on whom Jewish expectations had rested; he did not bring about the complete and im mediate redemption of Israel, let alone of all men. The Messiah whom God sent was his very own Son who embodied the principle of recon ciliation but did not himself actualize it. With Christ, all things be come new and the history of the old dispensations is brought to a de finitive close, and the Kingdom of God is proclaimed. A new kind of history then begins, one whose end has already been announced in 57Religion 2:579-91. 58 Galatians 4:4; Phenomenology, 163 (par. 206); Religion 3:231-2. The 1827 lectures' treatment of Christianity as a response to the estrangement of the ancient world is strengthened by Hegel's analysis of Judaism, though he proved incapable of incorporating the latter into his world-historical scheme. There he treats Judaism as a religion of "sublimity" that serves as a pendant to the Greek religion of beauty. Christianity thus becomes, in a positive sense, the sublation of these ancient religions, while negatively it arises at the intersection of Jewish estrangement from God and Roman estrangement from the world (3:228-30). Because in his other works he wishes to maintain a steady progression from the oriental world to Greece, then from Rome to the Germanic world, he must drop any systematic treatment of Judaism's role in the rise of Christianity. In the Philosophy of History (388-91 [321-3]) and the Philosophy of Right (?358) he treats it as an oriental anachronism "held in readiness" to intensify the estrangement in Rome and thus help open the Christian era.</page><page sequence="23">HEGEL AND POLITICAL THEOLOGY 881 the life and passion of Christ and which the Christian churches and Christian states have the task of realizing. The arrival of the Christian Messiah is not the end of history, it is the absolute historical turning point (Wendepunkt), the "axis on which the History of the World turns."59 It is the last dispensation, within which a genuine reconcilia tion?of God with man, of men with each other, of man with himself? can finally be sought. Stated another way, Hegel's doctrine of reconciliation rests upon his understanding of Christian eschatology, which he takes to be wholly unique.60 As he understands it, the Kingdom of God is no far off messianic state to be expected passively or hastened through hu man action. The Kingdom of God has already been present in the world, if only implicitly, since Christ's birth and it is slowly being real ized in the here and now. It is being realized subjectively through the development of Christian doctrine and philosophy, and later by the secular philosophy growing out of it. It is being realized objectively through the mutual development of Church and state, and through the tension between them. As the Church tries in these two ways to rec oncile itself with the world, it simultaneously manages to reconcile man with God. Hegel's argument here is theological, though it does not rest on recognizable features of Christ's teaching, which Hegel passes over in near silence. Christianity's originality is instead seen to rest on its mysterious doctrine of the Trinity. Some earlier peoples and sects conceived of God as triune, but Hegel is convinced that only Christian ity conceived him as realizing himself in the subjective, historical life of man in a trinitarian fashion.61 The history of Christianity is there fore not only the history of the Church, it is the history of the realiza tion of God in the world as Trinity. The first step in this trinitarian realization was the Incarnation. In the beginning, God differentiated himself by creating the world, and 59 Philosophy of History, 386 (319); Philosophy of Right, ?358. Compare Franz Rosenzweig, The Star of Redemption, trans.

This event is symbolized in the myth of the fall and is experi enced psychologically by men everywhere in their sense of guilt.62 When man's sense of his own evil, coupled with God's apparent death in Rome, brought man in history to the point of utter spiritual despair, the Son of God made his first appearance. Strictly speaking he was born in Bethlehem; yet Hegel insists that Christ was always present as an aspect of the Godhead, and therefore implicitly in human con sciousness. The Incarnation takes place only at the moment of infi nite anguish when man sees that although he cannot bring about rec onciliation by himself, nonetheless it already exists in principle. Only then "a human being appears to consciousness as god, and God ap pears to it as a human being." This is the absolute moment, the turn ing point. We are here in the presence of a new consciousness of humanity, or a new religion. Through it a new world is constituted, a new actuality, a different world condition. . . . The new religion expresses itself pre cisely as a new consciousness, the consciousness of a reconciliation of humanity with God. This reconciliation, expressed as a state of affairs, is the kingdom of God, an actuality.m This reconciliation advanced in a second step with Christ's Pas sion. The pagan Romans felt God was dead, though they never saw him alive; it would be more precise to say they experienced his ab sence but not his death. Once Christ became present his death took on another aspect, with different implications for human self-under standing. To witness the death of God is to see that death is part of God; death is not external to him, a merely human quality. God can be both God and death. Conversely, to witness God's death is to see that his mortality does not erase his divinity; divinity therefore need not be external to man, despite his mortality. Thus, Christ's death can help reconcile man to his own death and thereby reconcile him at least im plicitly with God. This is Christianity's, and Hegel's, hardest teaching: that man is both God and death.64 Christ's death as man makes possible the resurrection of spirit in its third form: the Christian community in history. Once the principle 62Religion 3:217-30; Phenomenology, 559-65 (pars. 770-7). 63 Religion 3:241. 64 Religion 3:245-50.</page><page sequence="25">HEGEL AND POLITICAL THEOLOGY 883 of Christianity is announced in Bethlehem and repeated on Golgatha, the fundamental task of history is to realize it in the world. What concerns us now is to make the principle of Christianity, which has been explained at considerable length, into the principle of the world; the task set before the world is to bring this absolute idea within itself, to actualize it in itself, and thereby to reconcile itself to God.65 This double-sided work of reconciliation takes place in the Christian community which now is existing spirit, the Holy Spirit or "God exist ing as community."66 At this moment the Church strides onto the stage of world history as the subject and object of reconciliation. "The reconciliation of God with himself is accomplished in the world, and not as a heavenly kingdom that is beyond. This community is the king dom of God on earth in the Church."67 Christ's birth announced the coming of that kingdom, but con sciousness was not prepared to grasp the implications of that revela tion. As religious consciousness it still thought of God as something outside itself, and imagined itself united with him only in a distant past or eschatological future. The history of the Church, which is world history from Christ's birth until the modern age, is the progressive overcoming of this confusion through the extension of Christianity into the world, a "world which still awaits its transfiguration."68 How is it transfigured? By placing the philosophical idea of ultimate recon ciliation before the nations and spreading it through a representa tional religion understood and felt by all. "The new religion has made the intelligible world of philosophy the world of common conscious ness," Hegel writes, and quotes approvingly Tertullian's boast that Christian children have a deeper knowledge of God than ancient phi losophers did.69 This transfiguration does not come about through miracles but through the patient work of history. 65 Vorlesungen ?ber die Geschichte der Philosophie (hereafter, "History of Philosophy") in Werke, vols. 18-20, 19:500 (3:5).

Like Judaism, Christianity waits in hopeful expec tation for the Kingdom of God to arrive. Unlike Judaism, however, Christianity has received the seed from which this kingdom will grow and is responsible for seeing that it is nurtured within itself in the here and now. The Church is the Kingdom of God on earth, something the nation of Israel could never pretend to be. Yet for just that reason Christendom has been divided since its inception over how this king dom is meant to relate to earthly things. Is its work of redemption and reconciliation a purely spiritual labor that draws men away from earthly pursuits? Or is it meant to transfigure those pursuits so that they become divine service? Hegel believes this problem, which exists in some form in all de veloped religions, is particularly acute in Christianity because of its unique eschatology. It appears most dramatically, of course, in the struggle between church and state that is conducted on the world stage, but it also appears within church and state as they attempt to reconcile the divine/earthly tension within themselves. The whole of post-Classical European history is, in Hegel's view, nothing but the working out of the spiritual and institutional dynamics set off by Christian eschatology. The goal of European history, and therefore world history, is to overcome the antithesis between church and state; the means by which that goal is approached are the violent struggles brought on by that very antithesis.70 Christianity was born as a "polemical" religion that placed itself in a hostile relation to the world around it.71 Within itself, it had dis covered the principle of freedom which human spirit had always sought; outside it saw only unfreedom. Thus began a withdrawal from the world that would last centuries. Only with the rise of the Carolingian Empire was there finally a Christian state, and only then can we begin to speak about Christian history.72 This empire was uni fied but weak, and eventually split apart under the negative force of individual nations, feudal lords, and the Church itself. Political chaos was the result, which provided the opportunity for the Church to as sert an independent right to govern. This was realized in a parallel ec clesiastical state shaped by the reforms of Gregory the Great. In prin ciple these reforms represented a victory of the spiritual principle 70 Philosophy of History, 140-1 (Introduction, 98); 415 (343).

It developed class distinctions (clergy/laity), lusted after property, bred corruption, and pursued megalomaniacal illusions of worldly empire in the Crusades. It was this last campaign that finally broke the Christian state apart; it would never again ap pear in history as a unified political force.73 The alienation of the Catholic epoch was mirrored in the spiritual lives of individual Christians, who felt themselves torn between unrec oncilable terrestrial and heavenly principles. As Hegel points out, the psychological pressure was all the greater because the Church itself came to preach both principles, one in a purely spiritual form, the other in an inverted worldly one: it preached celibacy and marriage, poverty and work, freedom and obedience.74 Were the individual Christian to turn for reconciliation to the secular world instead, he would not find it, for there alienation had reached an extreme in the mirror-world of the court, governed by honor and flattery.75 The paradoxical failure of Catholicism was to have been swal lowed up by the very world it sought to flee. The paradoxical achieve ment of Protestantism, in Hegel's eyes, was to have recovered the Christian principle by fully embracing the world and transfiguring it in the process. Protestantism discovered the genuine meaning of the freedom represented by the incarnation and passion of Christ. Against the political and spiritual bondage then brought by the 72 Christian history is, for Hegel, the history of German Europe. Hegel claims not to share Tacitus's blind admiration for the Germanic tribes, and in his late writings applauds their abandonment of folk religion and adoption of Roman culture. However, he does attribute the Germans' assumption of the Weltgeist in the Christian epoch to their innate, pre-Christian temperament, which he describes with that elastic term, Gem?t. He speaks of the "Nicht entzweiung des Gem?ts" to describing the reconciling potential of the Ger man temperment, which uniquely combines a genuine sense of freedom with a gregarious inclination toward association. Thus, although the Germans were rude barbarians requiring the polish of Rome and the enlightenment of Jerusalem, their hearts were open to Christian love and their society was pre pared for the demands of the modern state. 73Philosophy of History, 434-67 (360-98). 74 Religion 1:264, 3:342; Philosophy of History, 457 (380).

It also was advanced by the wars of reli gion, which established the independence of the Protestant churches within the modern state. The political implications of freedom were not always well understood by Protestants, as could be seen in the Calvinist theocracy of Geneva or the theories of absolute right of re sistance developed in England; but beginning with the reign of Freder ick the Great, Hegel believes, the political promise of Protestantism had finally been secured. Religious power had been placed outside the state while religious consciousness strengthened it by teaching in dividuals the rights and duties flowing from freedom and properly shaping their moral habits and customs.77 As it turned out, the limitations of Protestantism were not politi cal, they were spiritual. Protestantism is a religion that builds its tem ples and altars in the human heart.78 It teaches men that they will be justified (or not) according to their interior faith, and that the Scrip tures are open to them without the authoritative interpretation of the Church. This doctrine set off psychological dynamics from which modern man has yet to recover, all arising from infinitely complex questions about the grounds of faith, their relation to reason, and the purity of the will, which now served as the sole means of spiritual self justification.79 While Protestantism was making spiritual life more dif ficult, it was simultaneously making worldly life easier?by sanctify ing marriage, the accumulation of wealth, and political obligation, as well as opening up nature to the inquiries of modern science.80 On the 76 Philosophy of History, 492-7 (412-17); Religion 3:264-5; Encyclope dia, ?552. ^Philosophy of History, 504, 508-20 (424, 428-38); Religion 1:340-5. 78 Glauben und Wissen (hereafter, "Faith and Knowledge"), in Gesam melte Werke, ed.

Protestant culture at first represented a victory of individual faith over positive authority. As this principle developed in the Enlighten ment, human reason and freedom sought to vanquish even this inte rior faith. Finding himself a battleground modern man was left dissat isfied with both reason and faith, and his experience with Enlightenment was an unhappy one.81 Seeing sacred groves turned into marketable timber, human feelings reduced to the common coin of utility, by Hegel's time he had become a hollow Romantic living in "the grief of religious nostalgia" and the "torment of eternal self-con templation." This "beautiful soul" was hardly a man; he was a bat be longing to neither earth nor sky.82 He was unreconciled with the world that history has placed him into, haunted by the suspicion that it was not, after all, the Kingdom of God. The Kingdom of God. Hegel takes philosophy's relation to his tory to be thoroughly retrospective, painting its gray on gray long after the vivid colors of lived experience have faded. It is impossible to imagine him constructing an ideal city-in-speech along the lines of Plato's Republic. Yet near the end of the Encyclopedia, when he comes to the relation between Protestantism and the rational modern state, Hegel steps over the limits he himself put on philosophical sci ence and permits himself to speculate. His point of departure is, pre cisely, the Republic. In that dialogue Socrates persuades Glaucon that unless political power and philosophy coincide in the same place, there will be no rest from ills for cities and mankind.83 Hegel sees in this statement an ex plicit criticism of Athenian religion and politics for failing to realize the idea of human freedom. Since only philosophy could discover that idea, Plato mistakenly concluded that philosophy was required to ac tualize it. This was his greatest error, for he ignored the fact that the actualization of objectively valid ideas demands that they be 80 Philosophy of History, 497, 502-8, 520-4 (417, 422-6, 438-42); Ency clopedia, ?552. 81 Phenomenology, 423-4 (par. 573). 82 Faith and Knowledge, 317, 384, 382, 324. 83Republic 472d.</page><page sequence="30">888 MARK LILLA subjectively compelling, and that subjective consciousness is prima rily moved by feeling, intuition, and representation?in short, by reli gion, not philosophy. Philosophy can only comprehend principles al ready implicit in the religious life of a nation.84 The same is true of the state's relation to religion. No state can survive if it is not rooted in the moral life, the Sittlichkeit, of the na tion; principles alone are too weak to guarantee obedience to law if the latter stands against the moral conscience and habits of citizens. It is common to think of religion as a mere reflection of this national Sittlichkeit, but in fact the relationship is reversed. The mature Hegel insists that "religion is the very substance of Sittlichkeit and of the state," which means that "the state rests on the ethical sentiment [Ge sinnung], and that on the religious."85 In terms of content, religion and Sittlichkeit aie identical; but in terms of form, religion is the first to announce the truth which Sittlichkeit and state embody, and there fore must be considered the basis of both. Under no circumstances, even modern circumstances, is it possible to consider the state as in dependent of the religion and Sittlichkeit of its people. If, then, religion and state are inseparable and Sittlichkeit is their bond, the principles governing them cannot be in contradiction. He gel sees proof of this in Catholic lands of his day, which presume a moral servility on the part of individuals in both religion and the state; there, freedom could only be represented in external things, such as the host, the priest, or the king. A free state and a slavish religion like Catholicism are clearly incompatible.86 Protestantism is the religion of freedom par excellence, from which it appears to follow that being a Protestant state is a necessary, if insufficient, condition for being a free state. This truth was hidden from Plato because history had not yet revealed to him the true religion, and so he found it inconceivable that religion could ever assist in the task of bringing freedom to the city. Only when spirit develops to the point that it understands that freedom is its essence "does the absolute possibility and necessity ex ist for political power, religion, and the principles of philosophy to co incide, and for the reconciliation of actuality in general with spirit, and of the state with religious consciousness and philosophical 84Encyclopedia, ?552, pp. 362-3 (288-9). 85Encyclopedia, ?552, p. 355 (283). 86Encyclopedia, ?552, p. 359 (287).</page><page sequence="31">HEGEL AND POLITICAL THEOLOGY 889 knowledge."87 That point was reached, at least in principle, with Prot estantism: Thus ultimately, in the Protestant conscience the principles of the reli gious and of the ethical conscience come to be one and the same: the free spirit learning to see itself in its reasonableness and truth. The con stitution and the code, along with their applications, embody the princi ple and the development of Sittlichkeit, which proceeds and can only proceed from the actual truth of religion, when instated in its original principle. The Sittlichkeit of the state and the religious spirituality of the state are thus its reciprocal, strong guarantees. This extraordinary statement has encouraged two erroneous in terpretations of Hegel's intention, both of which he himself tried to forestall. The most common one in his lifetime, though all but forgot ten today, is that Hegel wished to give religion absolute priority over the state by treating it as the latter's foundation. Yet in the Philosophy of Right Hegel explicitly noted that while religion is the groundwork of Sittlichkeit and therefore of the state, "it is at the same time only a groundwork." Religion's relation to the Absolute is based on feeling and representation, rendering it incapable of bringing the truth into existence. The state, on the other hand, "is the divine will as present spirit, unfolding as the actual shape and organization of a world."m To be genuine, the state must be considered an end in itself and not re ligion's partner. A union of religion and state in the modern age would represent a revival of oriental despotism, which Hegel does not even consider a form of state.90 The state is the idea made concrete and ra tional; religion works through feelings and faith, and therefore is natu rally suspicious of reason and has a deep affinity for authority and tyr anny, as Galileo and Giordano Bruno could attest.91 It also encourages fanatics whose private access to the divine makes them a threat to any ethical order.92 A converse error has been to see in Hegel's theory of the modern state a funeral oration for religion. The notion that religion might eventually be extinguished in history arises out of Hegel's account of religion's relation to philosophical science. Whether this relation is 87Encyclopedia, ?552, p. 364 (290). 88Encyclopedia, ?552, p. 365 (291). ? Philosophy of Right, ?270, pp. 417-18(292).

As the culmination of religion, Christianity allows spirit to be reconciled to itself; philosophy as the science of absolute knowing makes it explicit, transforming the present into spirit's own act and bringing certainty to the truth buried in religion.93 When Hegel in his early works then speaks of the birth of genuine philosophy being prepared by the sense of "infinite grief that "God is dead," and arriving on a God-forsaken "speculative Good Friday," the "Calvary of spirit," many conclude that he was referring to a historical moment when the chains of religion would finally be broken.94 This has indeed been the left-Hegelian position down to our own time. It was stated with admirable economy by Alexandre Koj?ve when he wrote that "all evolution of the Christian world is nothing but a march toward the atheistic realization of the essential finitude of human existence" and that therefore "Christianity is the coming to be of atheism."95 Yet even were we to accept the hypothesis that Hegel sees philos ophy as an atheistic science, this would still leave religion's historical destiny unclear. The arrival of genuine philosophical science in con sciousness and in world history merely signifies that spirit's advance is no longer led by religion; the history of religion thereby comes to an end, but not religion?nor theological-political problems.96 The age of philosophical science brings with it the philosophy of religion, which Hegel calls the "final" philosophical science because with it comes the realization that "philosophy is only explicating itself when it expli cates religion," and that both are Gottesdienst.?7 This science is only 93Phenomenology, 572-4, 582, 588-9 (pars. 787, 797-8, 805); Encyclope dia, ?573. 94 Faith and Knowledge, 413-14; Phenomenology, 571-2, 590-1 (pars. 785, 808). 95 Alexandre Koj?ve, Introduction ? la lecture de Hegel (Paris: Galli mard, 1947), 183, 256.

Religion could cease to exist in the rational state only under one of two conditions. The first is that all its citizens become philoso phers, in the sense that they no longer need to have truth represented to them but become capable of grasping it rationally and acting on it morally without appeal to their subjective feelings. Yet Hegel states explicitly, and more than once, that philosophers will always be a class apart since only the rarest of individuals seeks and is satisfied with scientific cognition of truth.98 A second condition, which Hegel does consider, is that the subjective labor of religion be taken over by some other sort of common experience that brings citizens into the truth and encouraging them to act on it. The one such experience He gel does mention is patriotism, which he also calls the "political dispo sition."99 But can patriotism be strong enough to support the entire system of Sittlichkeit, answering all the questions it answers regard ing our rights and duties? And if it could, what kind of state would it be? Hegel's few and enigmatic remarks on patriotism do not answer these questions.100 If the Kingdom of God is neither a rational state free from religion nor a Protestant oriental despotism, what is it? The most we can draw from Hegel's scattered and inconsistent statements on this supremely ^Encylopedia, 23-5 (11-12), ?573; Religion 1:88, 3:183-4. 99 Philosophy of Right, ??267-8. 100 This issue is addressed once again by Hegel in his manuscript on The German Constitution. There he suggests that the identity religion once pro vided is now "something which modern states have found they can do with out," and that such a state now knows "how to maintain stability enough on its own account." How Hegel judges this development is not clear. See He gel's Schriften zur Politik und Rechtsphilosophie, ed. Georg Lasson, 2nd ed. (Leipzig: Meiner, 1923), 25-6. A different interpretation of the religion and patriotism issue has been put forward by Shlomo Avineri. Avineri believes Hegel to have been a pluralistic modernizer, as he puts it, not a nationalist or proponent of any particular religion. Avineri interprets Hegel's conception of Volksgeist as a cultural force capable of uniting citizens within a state, with out appeal to nationalism or militarism, and thus at some remove from the volkish ideas of Herder or, later, Savigny. See Shlomo Avineri, Hegel's The ory of the Modern State (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1972), 35, 223. Also relevant is Avineri's "Hegel and Nationalism," in Hegel's Political Philosophy, ed. Walter Kaufmann (New York: Atherton, 1970), 130-1. If this interpretation is to be convincing, and not mere wishful thinking, it must con front the thoroughly religious quality Hegel attributes to the Volksgeist of the ancients, and explain how a secuarlized version of it could still satisfy the subjective needs of modern man.</page><page sequence="34">892 MARK LILLA important topic is the following: it will be a rational state in a Protes tant nation, where Protestantism is organically woven into the Sitten of its citizens but where the Protestant churches are clearly subordi nated to the state. This is what Hegel intends when he speaks in Reli gion o? the "harmony of church and state" made possible in a Protes tant context.101 Other religions have a tendency to distinguish the freedom of faith from that of the state, fuelling wars among religions and against them. The only way to ensure that the formal constitution of the rational state is made subjectively effective is that the state learn to allow religion to help it. "Conviction does not necessarily take the form of religion," Hegel concedes, "but in what we refer to as 'the people' the ultimate truth does not have the form of thoughts and principles," therefore, "for the people this determinate character of right and ethical life has its ultimate verification only in the form of an extant religion."102 For modern men, that religion is the Protestantism that surreptitiously rules their hearts and minds. IV The decision. For the young Hegel, Christianity was a problem. With time, as he discovered that the solutions to all human problems lie buried in the problems themselves, Hegel came to see how Chris tianity's development overcame its own shortcomings. Christianity began as an apolitical or even antipolitical religion; its arrival widened the gulf between citizen and state that had grown up in Rome, further removing man from the naive unity of the Greek city-state. Yet, again with time, the theological-political Entzweiung original to Christian ity helped to prepare the way for a higher and more durable reconcili ation within the rational state, a reconciliation cemented by the mod ern Sitten inculcated by Protestantism. Early Christianity's contemptuous withdrawal from political life now appears to have been necessary for the mature faith to develop into the consummate political religion. With the modern Protestant state, man's expectant hopes for ulti mate reconciliation?with himself, with others, with his God?are fi nally satisfied; but satisfaction has its price. Since the achievement of 101 Religion 1:344. 102 Religion 1:347.</page><page sequence="35">HEGEL AND POLITICAL THEOLOGY 893 the rational state does not extinguish the need for religion, that state must find a way to incorporate the churches within itself organically, though without becoming a theocracy or an oriental despotism. Such an achievement would be unprecedented but, according to Hegel, not impossible; indeed, it is the necessary outcome of modern history. The church-state conflict will finally be put to rest once each side learns to see itself in the other. That is, the churches must accept their political obligations, while the state must harken to its divine calling. Hegel's proclamation of the state's divinity has been an embar rassment to nearly all his defenders. They are understandably loath to read into his thought the fateful history of modern Germany, and so have confected ingenious reasons for passing over these remarks. Yet even if we provisionally accept the (un-Hegelian) principle that intel lectual and historical developments must be considered separately, the statements appear more than once in Hegel's works and therefore need to be understood within his system?not least because they ap pear at a culminating moment in that system. The important passages are to be found in the Philosophy of Right, which is indisputably Hegel's last word on politics. There he does not speak in the prophetic language of the history lectures but rather, as we have seen, in the precise vocabulary of science, asserting that the state is the divine will as it unfolds and organizes a world.103 This remark comes just before Hegel's treatment of sovereignty, and turns out to be essential to it. While making the case for hereditary, constitutional monarchy, Hegel likens the king to God in his exercise of sovereignty, and makes explicit reference to ontological proofs of God, which try to reconcile God's necessary existence with his free dom.104 If God is conceived as a necessary being but not free, he is an equation, not a sovereign. If, on the other hand, he is said to be free but not necessary, he is nothing more than a despotic demiurge. The monarch, if he is to be a genuine sovereign like God, must be equally free and necessary. For the concept of sovereignty to have any meaning, Hegel be lieves it must establish the state as being absolute and self-determin ing. To speak loosely of popular sovereignty or, worse, divided i?3 Philosophy of Right, ?270, pp. 417-18 (292). 104 Philosophy of Right, ?280.</page><page sequence="36">894 MARK LILLA sovereignty is to renounce the concept altogether.105 Moreover, if this absolute, self-determined sovereign is to have subjective certainty and not be a mere abstraction, he must be able to exercise his will in a sovereign decision. Monarchy and sovereignty imply each other be cause both rest on the power to decide: "this absolutely decisive mo ment of the whole is not individuality in general, but one individual, the monarch." Only a monarch can give the state decisive "personal ity," cutting short the weighing of alternatives and resolving them with his irrecovable "I will."106 Returning to theology, Hegel then explains the genuine signifi cance of the doctrine of the divine right of kings. He recognizes the abuses to which this doctrine had led, but reminds the reader of the genuine affinity between the powers ascribed to God by theologians and those of the rational state: both must assert their sovereignty. Be fore history reached the point where a king could be truly sovereign and not merely capricious, and could be conceived to be so, men had no choice but to ascribe the power of ultimate decision to some fa tum in the beyond which could only be read by priests or oracles. "This decision had to come into existence, but its roots lay outside the circle of human freedom which the state encompasses."107 For the young Hegelians, beginning with Feuerbach, the ascrip tion of qualities to the divine was a simple process of transference, which was slowly being undone by history as man found in himself the powers he once worshipped in God. Divine right, therefore, was destined to become human right; but here, as at so many junctures, Hegel distinguishes himself sharply from his followers. If divine right were revealed to be simply human, he reasons, politics would be thor oughly disenchanted, appearing as a realm of mere chance?as a realm of freedom without necessity. Yet since we know that the state is sovereign, that it is absolute and self-determining, its sovereignty must be incarnated in a single man chosen by nature, not by human will. Such a monarch must surrender his particularity, since "the ob jective aspect is solely the concern of the law, to which the monarch 105 Philosophy of Right, ??275-8. 106 Philosophy of Right, ?279. Hegel makes a similar argument to ex plain why Christ had to appear as one human being for reconciliation to take place. See Religion 3:233-9. 107Philosophy of Right, ?279. Hegel adds that it was Socrates' discovery of his daimonion that anticipated mankind's later realization that the sover eign of decision rests within man.</page><page sequence="37">HEGEL AND POLITICAL THEOLOGY 895 merely has to add his subjective 'I will.'"108 In return he assumes the mantle of monarchical majesty, proclaiming to the world by his pres ence that the state, whose will and very existence have no ultimate ground, finds in him its unity and necessity.109 Just as God's decision fills the aporia o? being, so the monarch's majestic decisions fill the aporia o? politics. The only difference is that since the birth of Christ, if not since the Creation, God's power of decision has been exhausted; history now does his work for him. The monarch, the incarnation of state sovereignty, must still decide in the here and now. In this sense it can be justifiably said that Hegel reserves powers for the king that he has already removed from God.110 Religion of state. Such a sovereign, if he is wise, will pay very close attention to the churches within his realm. Protestantism seems at an infinite remove from the pagan cults of the ancient Near East, but it is still fundamentally a cultus, with all the duties attending to that office.111 Seen from the standpoint of religion, the cultus is the actualization of the reconciliation between man and God, which, in the Christian case, has been implicit in history since Christ's birth. From the standpoint of the state, the cultus is the loam in which Sittli chkeit is rooted for most citizens, and therefore it is the groundwork of the state.112 Hegel is under no illusion that the modern state, simply by virtue of its modernity, has somehow outgrown the need to culti vate political conviction. On the contrary, he sees that "conviction and the formal constitution are inseparable and mutually indispens able" and warns against the one-sided modern view that constitutions are self-sustaining and that religion can be a matter of indifference. "In the formally developed constitution the ultimate sheet-anchor is still conviction," which for most people means religion.113 Given this fact, the rational state is obliged to manage religion, which in the case of Christianity poses a challenge. Throughout most of its history Christianity considered itself to be the ultimate human community (Gemeinde), a view Hegel accepts as an important, if 108 Philosophy of Right, ?280 z. 109 Philosophy of Right, ?281. 110 "So erlaubt Hegel dem K?nig, was sein Gott nicht darf'; Theunissen, Hegels Lehre, 447. 111 Encyclopedia, ?555. 112 Compare Encyclopedia, ?552, p. 365 (291); ?562, and Philosophy of Right, ?270, pp. 417-18 (292) with Religion 1:249 and 358-9. 113 Religion 1:346-7.</page><page sequence="38">896 MARK LILLA partial, truth; for its was only within the Christian church that man discovered the principle of his spiritual freedom and began to see it actualized.114 Now the church's claim has been superseded by that of the state, which actualizes man's freedom completely in the spiritual and worldly realms. The church therefore loses its status as an inde pendent second estate, leaving only two within the state: the landed aristocracy and the burghers.115 The church is present, one might even say omnipresent, though it has no official position within the state structures. The most Hegel will say about its function is that "if the religion in question is of a genuine kind and does not have this negative and polemical attitude towards the state, but acknowledges and endorses it, it will also have a status [Zustand] and expression of its own [f?r sich]."116 The ambiguity of this statement has led to much speculation about how exactly Hegel imagined the church would play its crucial role in cultivating conviction for the modern state. The issue is com plicated further by his seemingly contradictory remarks about the na tional character of modern religion, and therefore of the state. As we have seen, in the early writings he made much of religion as the vessel of the Nationalgeist and Volksgeist, and later as the foundation o? Sit tlichkeit, but these earlier concepts remain present in the later writ ings, appearing last in Religion: The one spirit is in principle the substantial foundation; this is the spirit of a people [Geist eines Volkes] in the way it is determined within the in dividual periods of world history?the national spirit [Nationalgeist]. This national spirit constitutes the substantial foundation within the individual, for all of us are born within our own people and belong to thisspririt.117 The question is: can Protestantism be conceived in such exclu sive, nationalistic terms? It would seem not. Hegel, in fact, is highly critical of Judaism's "stubborn" exclusivity, which he finds all the more objectionable given that the Jews were the first to discover the (implicit) universality of the divine. He admits, however, that the Christian God is restricted, too, and is represented as the national God of Christendom. Yet since Christianity, unlike Judaism, aspires luReligion 3:256. ^Philosophy of Right, ??303-8. 116 Philosophy of Right, ?270, p. 420 (294). 117 See the footnote at Religion 1:335.

There he asserts that since religion is what integrates individuals into the state, they should be required to belong to some sort of religious community, though which community is up to them, since the state cannot judge the nature of inner conviction. The state should insure that the churches are protected and supported, and if it is strong should adopt a liberal attitude toward religious diversity?but not just any religion is to receive state encouragement. In a long footnote Hegel addresses those groups?Quakers, Anabaptists, Jews?whose faith may make it impossible for them to take part fully in the political life of the state. Such people should be tolerated in the realm of civil society?but again, only if the state is strong, which means that the religions must be relatively weak. Individuals in such groups can be granted civil rights as human beings, even if their religions do not permit them to accept political rights. (On practical grounds Hegel argues that such hospitality should even be extended to Jews, even though they could be plausibly thought to belong to a foreign Volk.) In short, it appears that membership only in certain Protestant churches is fully consis tent with citizenship in Hegel's modern state.119 118 Religion 2:575-8. See also the long footnote from the 1831 lectures appended to this passage. 119 Philosophy of Right, ?270, p. 421 (294-6). Shlomo Avineri has made a case for reading Hegel in another light. He rejects any association between what he sees as Hegel's purely political and cultural conception of Volk and the more vitalistic one associated with Herder. He points out, correctly, that the Greek Volksgeist Hegel celebrated was not national in our modern sense. Consequently, any number of religions would be consistent with the Volks geist of the modern state. See Avineri, Hegel's Theory of the Modern State, 35, 46-7, 169, 223, and "Hegel and Nationalism," 130-1. Franz Rosenzweig and Jean Hyppolite seem on firmer ground, however, when they contrast Montesquieu's concept of national moeurs and Hegel's national spirit?which is, precisely, spiritual and therefore constitutive of the nation. The modern European state is unimaginable without the infusion of the spirit of Protestantism, and the historical triumph of the former necessar ily implies the triumph of the latter. Toleranz in this context might be trans lated as noblesse oblige. See Franz Rosenzweig, Hegel und der Staat, 2 vols. (Munich and Berlin: R. Oldenbourg, 1920), 2:178-88, and Jean Hyppolite, In troduction ? la philosophie de l'histoire de Hegel (Paris: Seuil, 1983), 17, 27 8,92.</page><page sequence="40">898 MARK LILLA Hegel's overriding concern in his treatment of the church-state question here is that religion actively support the state and never again pose a threat to it. Protestantism is the best candidate to serve in that position as the unofficial religion of the modern state. It se cures its power by welcoming all into its tent and by suffusing its per fume throughout society through the medium of Sittlichkeit, protes tantizing even adherents to other faiths. If there is conflict between any of these churches and the state, Hegel's position is clear: the state's view must prevail by right, since while the church only believes in the truth and teaches it authoritatively, "the state possesses knowl edge." The consummate reconciliation. The question with which this investigation began was whether Hegel's adoption of the Christian principle of reconciliation, which gives the community of Christians the decisive role in bringing that reconciliation about in history, had philosophical grounds. The answer to this question is affirmative: He gel demonstrated that reconciliation is the principle of Christianity, and that with the growth of Christendom it had become the principle of the world. Hegel's grounds are not those of the Christian churches, however. Between them yawns an anthropological divide that cannot be bridged. For Christianity, man is in need of reconciliation because he is a fallen creature; he is a sinner who needs the grace of Christ Jesus, who accepts his repentance, justifies him, and redeems him. Hegel is interested in the story of the fall and finds that like all myths it contains a kernel of rational truth.121 But it plays no role in his un derstanding of human nature. For Hegel, man is alienated and mis takes this state for a state of sin; the reconciliation he requires is relief from alienation, not redemption, and this can only be had through the work of negativity, not grace.122 Christendom did indeed prepare the reconciliation of the world, through the cunning of reason, though not 120 Philosophy of Right, ?270, p. 425 (299). 121 Religion 3:224-33. 122 Hegel "understood reconciliation not as an incomprehensibly new beginning, but simply as a continuation of the one eventual course of truth, which is identical with the existence of God himself. . . . God and man can never confront one another in a relationship which is actual and indissoluble, a word, a new word revelatory in the strict sense, cannot pass between them"; Karl Barth, From Rousseau to Ritschl (London: SCM Press, 1959), 303.</page><page sequence="41">HEGEL AND POLITICAL THEOLOGY 899 the triumph of faith. Its victory, which philosophical science alone can comprehend, remains a mystery to Christians. But if Hegel removes the anthropological presuppositions of the Christian doctrine of reconciliation, he vastly extends its reach in his theory of the modern state. The idea of a political reconciliation of the world through Christianity is a marginal notion in the history of Chris tian thought, where it confronted serious theological and political ob jections.123 Hegel imagines that such a reconciliation will take place as soon as two historical processes are complete: the disenchantment of Christianity and the transfiguration of the state. These processes are linked but need to be distinguished. Of the two, the disenchantment of Christianity raises the most serious prob lems since it threatens a central notion in Hegel's political theory, that of Sittlichkeit. All states, including modern states, are held together by Sitten that motivate moral action and political obligation; but for the modern state to be modern, its Sitten must be indistinguishable from those of Protestantism. Is such identity possible for Christianity, even in its Protestant form? This can be doubted, given that all the features of Christian spiritual life that have traditionally inspired con viction?sin, repentance, grace, agape, redemption?have been emp tied of their subjective, emotional content by the Hegelian philosophy. Hegel gives no grounds for thinking that even if Protestantism were fully secularized and the practice of caritas could be routinized, such a religion could inspire the least conviction. Nor does he persuade us that a more robust faith, should it survive, would remain public spir ited. And what if it did? To the extent that Christianity has ambitions in the world, they are universal; they recognize no natural or human boundaries. Yet all states, even modern ones, are defined by just those boundaries, whose maintenance and defense must be guaran teed by healthy Sitten. Unless those boundaries were to disappear or become irrelevant through the development of a universal secular state (a prospect Hegel does not contemplate) or a universal Christian one (which he considers impossible), the problem of dual moral loyal ties remains. Individuals would face the choice of being good citizens, and potentially having to betray the faith that is the foundation of their 123 See Gilson, Les m?tamorphoses, chapters 3-5.</page><page sequence="42">900 MARK LILLA Sitten, or remaining modern Christians attached to Sitten whose foundations and demands are suprapolitical. To the degree that Christianity is disenchanted, Hegel believes, the modern state must also be transfigured. The Hegelian state is not a theocracy, nor is it an oriental despotism. Yet it does have an escha tological mission, inherited from Christianity, to reconcile the world, and must be seen to be reconciling it. That is why Hegel insists that the rational modern state must be a monarchy, albeit a constitutional one. Religion is a form of representation, and as Christianity is secu larized and rationalized, its representational function diminishes; but once the state takes over the mission of reconciliation, its representa tional needs increase. That is why the king is required: he is the last representation. He broadcasts to the world that the state is finally at one with itself, that man has achieved complete sovereignty and is be holden to no one, not even to God. The images of Christ ascending in glory or seated in judgment over mankind are now replaced by that of an aged sovereign dressed in uniform, offering a weary salute and signing proclamations.
