They are not so likely to touch the man whose reputation matures as slowly as himself. For the former, to die at the presumptive top of his form is perhaps to gain; for the latter, it is probably to lose. And although the wonderful thing about death from any cause other than old age is that no one can ever tell whether or not it fell at the right moment, the death of Gaston Lachaise certainly seems untimely. His work had come of age and had been crowned, but many per- haps unexpected things were still to be expected of him. There is, however, a consistency in his work that is as far removed from mere sameness as an autograph signa- ture is from a rubber stamp. Lachaise may have signed his name in many ways, but it was always his name and it never was made into a rubber stamp for someone else to multiply. Names written in rubber stamps may as well be writ in water. Lachaise's work may be said to have taken roughly ten years of initial development from the time of the appear- ance of a strictly personal style about 1910-1912. But one could never say of him; "That period is past. This period begins here," etc.; for his work is all of a piece. And many of his major designs were in process over sev- eral years. He corrected and refined and polished. Not only did he cut and polish stone, but, when he had had a figure cast from plaster or wax, he worked over the bronze with infinite pains and with the skill of the lapidary. The beautiful surfaces of his bronzes (as well as of his stones) are due to his hand upon the metal, as their forms are due to his hand upon the clay. (I cannot understand, by the way, why he should have admired Epstein as he admired Lehmbruck and Brancusi; the direct translation into bronze of Epstein's spattered clay surfaces should have annoyed him. But I never seized the opportunity to ask him.) The Standing Woman begun in 1912 and not com- pleted until 1927 is the complete example of the slow growth of his work; of this piece I shall have to speak again. To pass over the obvious statements to the effect that "It is too soon to appraise," etc., let me say that the excellent comments already made by Messrs. Gallatin, Cum- mings, Seldes, McBride, and Mayor, and most recently and admirably by Lincoln Kirstein, do not simplify, but rather make vastly more difficult, the task of writing about Lachaise. As this is more an extended obituary than a preface to a new catalogue, I find myself obliged to speak from the limited point of view of one who is still puzzled, in spite of having derived pleasure these many months from seeing every day a major work by the sculptor. But of this, too, I must speak later. There are first some general considerations. Of these the most general and the most universally troublesome is the question of the physicality and often sexuality of Lachaise's figures. Perhaps many laymen, pre- pared by the Museum of Modern Art's one-man show in 1935, are less shocked by the group exhibited latterly at the Whitney Museum than they might have been more than a year ago. Still, the word "abnormality" forms upon laymen's lips; and "abnormality" is too easy to say. Mr. Kirstein's introduction to the Museum of Modern Art catalogue has already clarified the point considerably, but it will require to be clarified again and again as the pub- licly known oeuvre is increased (for it is bound to in- crease) by the casting and issuing from the studio of the works which Lachaise left completed in clay or plaster. We know that many of these hitherto unpublished works will be startling to a degree. This "abnormality," seen so superficially and with such FIVE</page><page sequence="2">STANDING WOMAN 1930-1934 LACHAISE At the Lyzman Allyn Muserum, Nezw London alarm by many, is perhaps, as Lachaise may have told himself, a super-normality, a return to first principles. He always insisted upon the healthful effect of his sculpture upon the spectator. Though completely honest, he was even a little childish about it, like a missionary who be- lieves that all will be well if only the heathen will learn to read the Bible, or a manufacturer of nostrums who is sure that a more abundant life follows upon the con- sumption of his elixir. This healthful effect was not of course his prime purpose in creation, for to him as to Walt Whitman, whom he admired, "The song is to the singer." Yet there is something in it: a fine array of Lachaise can banish ten times its weight in prurience. The "abnormality" is also very probably a counter- abnormality in protest against the elaborate, fashionable, professionally conspiratorial sexual abnormalities of this century. His "abnormality" if he had any, was less fancy than these, was in the opposite direction, and was more agreeable. If there was anything Freudian about it, that will have to be investigated by the psycho-analytical faculty; I for one expect a result as vindicating as that found in the case of Van Gogh by doctors Doiteau and Leroy. By this time everyone is bored to tears by the stale jokes made about Lachaise's models. No important professional sculptor of modern time has, I suppose, been so free from the influence of the model. Many admirable sculptors use models without depending too much upon them, but he was so little dependent that he almost never used one. When he did, the model was a point of departure to which he was not likely to return except when he was positively doing a portrait. There are no portraits in his oeuvre ex- cept those which are definitely labeled (and which were usually definitely commissioned) as such. The very an- onymity of his monumental figures is one of the things that make them a little unapproachable. Theirs is the unapproachableness of a just pride. The portraits are more readily approachable, although even they are less specific than they are essential and typical. This is not to say that Lachaise made his sub- jects into types, but rather that he could, by observation of their identifying peculiarities, register and characterize them once for all. For the expression of the inward and spiritual must always be accomplished by the selective and even biased delineation of the outward and visible. The rough-hewn face and the even more rough-hewn hair of John Marin and the extraordinary ears of Carl van Vech- ten, as seen by Lachaise, are unforgettable. And by the choice and manipulation of less highly developed pecu- liarities the sculptor captured that quality, half "clean- cut" and half begeistert, of E. E. Cummings. This sort of diagnosis, this seeing of what others do not see, makes the artist one of the earthly instruments by which cor- ruption may put on incorruption. Through him some may eventually see what they have not seen before, and others may see what no one has seen before, not even the artist. The fact that medical and psychological diagnoses of previously unsuspected ailments have often been made from portraits should restore somewhat the damaged credit of clairvoyance if not of phrenology. Such medical and psychological evidence must abound in Lachaise's portraits. Did he leave a self-portrait? One would like to know. His half-length and full-length portrait nudes are a field in which he had only just got well started at the time of his death. His reasons for doing them may have been connected with his idea of the healthful effect of his imaginative works; those were sincere and, I think, laudable reasons. Even in small size, these portraits are wonderfully successful. Faces, after all, or at least the faces of people who habitually wear clothes, are like clothes, and have to be seen through. The artist may help the spectator thus to see through a face, but when the whole body is visible to both artist and spectator the task is lightened for the latter. What, however, would Lachaise have done with a portrait commission from a sit- ter who to our idealizing eyes was physically disagreeable? And shall we in future learn to dissemble with our bodies as we do, or try to do, with our faces? If we do, we shall still not be able to deceive the Lachaises. The small figures in bronze lie somewhere between the small portraits and the monumental figures. These small ones are not of course without monumentality: some are on a scale so vast that to execute them at larger dimen- sions would be to come much nearer to filling the uni- verse than ever Brancusi could come with his columns- without-end. The only circumstance that makes one feel that these are actually minor efforts is this: some of them "date" in the wrong way. Art-scholarship is almost always able to date works of art by their style, but that a work of art should "date" by its appurtenances or state of mind makes it immediately suspect. The mannered draperies and beads of the otherwise excellent Smith College Woman, SIX</page><page sequence="3">the Cuban heels and Spanish combs of several later figures, and the somehow gay-ninetyish aspect of the Boy With A . . . Tennis Racket, are all rather damaging. This last work is, to be sure, a portrait; the subject must forgive me. Yet in such things as the Woman Walking (No. 19 of the Museum of Modern Art Show), where we might ex- pect "dating" or some other superficial trouble because ! *?i of the unexpected and untypical charm of the piece, there :~i! is no such trouble. Here is all the pride and magnificence of the colossal images, together with a curious poised mo- tion, a reposeful and unviolent rhythm, and a strong sense of organism, of the interpenetration of forms. To this figure, so homogeneous in its scheme of bulbous similar Z:"'! masses restrained as if by an invisible envelope, blunted as if by the pressure of the wind, the sculptor properly gave one of the most brilliantly polished of all his surfaces. Re- peated reflections emphasize the close relationship of the few broad elements of the piece. Many others among the small bronzes are the vehicles of Lachaise's experiments in the synthesis of form and forms, of his studies of the structure of the human body. Almost always, when there exist two or more versions of the same attitude, the later version is the more generalized in its translation of the body, but the more dogmatic in its own structure. Witness the 1929 and the 1934 ver- sions of the female acrobat who stands on one hand with her legs extended above her. The first is a specific repre- sentation of a not uncommon acrobatic feat. The per- former's costume is even indicated by a plating or patina- tion different in color from the bronze of the body. The second version is almost an abstraction. The attitude, but for a change in the position of the free arm, made to unify the mass, is identical, but most of the specific traits have been boiled away. The buttocks have be- come a many-lobed nimbus for the head, which no longer has features. The differences between ankle and calf, be-.ii tween foot and leg, are exaggerated, and the comparison between buttocks and breasts is made much plainer by an arbitrary equalization of measures. The small Back of a Torso (Museum of Modern Art No. 43) and the i similar though not so stylized Front of a Torso, which exists in several casts, are also close to abstraction.

Dunbar FLOATING WOMAN (left) 1927 LACHAISE Collection Madame Lachaise much are they studies in pure form that I have often wished that the backs of the castings could have been routed out and polished, the whole casting being treated as a shell of uniform thickness, so that we might have seen the concave aspect of the form as well as the convex. The marble Knees, in the collection of Edward M. M. Warburg, is the most fully simplified of all Lachaise's works, and is almost purely abstraction. The whole ob- ject has become a symbol, almost in the sense of the symbol of the Bell trademark which appears in the bas- relief frieze in the Telephone and Telegraph Building. In another small marble, the Crouching Torso recently ac- quired by Smith College, the articulation and interpenetra- tion of the principal masses of the female torso are so presented as to make not only a marvellously lucid ex- position of the organism but also the most nolvfacial niece of small sculpture of my acquaintance. One first sees it from above, but he must also see it from slightly below and certainly from all around. In this sense it is totally - - --- -- ----- ... ------- (Continued on page 31) SEVEN</page><page sequence="4">GASTON LACHAISE (Continued from page 7) Both figures have indeed in the highest degree the pride and unap- proachableness which make explana- tions so difficult. Both have a sort of entogeneric vitality, a sense of be- ing full of blood and breath, a look of being pneumatic but certainly not deflatable. And both are of heroic mould, though the later is about half again as tall as the life-sized earlier one. Beyond this, there are differ- ences. From the extraordinarily long time spent upon it, the first has gained the look of being dzurch komnponiert: there is no point of view from which the insistent flow of lines is not satis- factory. The figure loses, though, by being a little self-conscious. Its forms are not so exaggerated as those of the later work, but its state of mind and to some extent its pose are mannered. Yet its mysterious grandeur and its godlike bearing, together with its poly- faciality, make it hard to surpass. The second figure is definitely bad from one point of view: the left side is clumsy when seen at right angles. This question of unifaciality versus polyfaciality, which Stanley Casson has discussed, cannot be settled on merits. Despite its fault from one point of view, the later work is cer- tainly a polyfacial composition. It is also a very compact one. Its articula- tion is much more emphasized than that of the early Woman, who has a certain blurriness which may be a subtle way of making transitions. The later Woman has hardly a transition about her, every ample feature being firmly marked. This is a dogmatic exposition of organic structure. It would be useless for anyone to argue, for instance, against the stylizations: the luxurious wasp waist, the heart- shaped abdomen, and the enviable calves. The whole thing seems in- arguable; one may analyze and an- alyze without discovering what is the disquieting ingredient in this richly satisfactory complex. Perhaps it posi- tively requires the presence of the companion figure, the colossal Man. The complementary nature of these figures, as of the group newly shown, is as far removed as possible from the distressful anthropomorphism of Ro- din's Kiss. Yet the fact that there is in the Standing Woman of 1930- 1934 a disturbing quality which is absent from the Standing Woman of 1912-1927, may be taken to justify Lachaise's own belief that the earlier sculpture was both the kernel and the summation of his work. For the pres- ent, let it be so. ARTISTS' CONGRESS The League of American Artists was formed at the conclusion of the first American Artists Congress in New York City on March 16 as a national organization to advance art- ists' economic rights and defend their freedom of expression in cooperation with other groups working toward that end and other organized groups engaged in the struggle against war and fascism. Out of the country-wide represen- tation in the congress was elected an executive committee of forty mem- bers, including Nicolai Cikovski of Cincinnati, Ohio; Robert White of Cedar Rapids, Iowa; George Biddle, of Washington, D. C.; Philip Kaplan of Cleveland; Beniamino Bufano of San Francisco; John Howard of Santa Fe, New Mexico; Joe Jones of St. Louis; Walt Speck of Detroit, and among New York artists, Paul Man- ship, Stuart Davis, William Gropper, Rockwell Kent, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Alexander Brook, Max Weber, Arnold Blanch, Margaret Bourke-White, and Aaron Douglas, Negro artist. In the public meeting which opened the congress at Town Hall on Friday evening, February 14, the gathering had unanimously adopted a resolution offering by George Biddle, president of the Mural Painters Society, pledging refusal to participate in the exhibi- tion of art to be held in concurrence with the Olympic Games in 1936, and urging "all other American art so- cieties and individual artists to refuse to exhibit in Germany, as a protest against the spiritual intolerance and suppression of free thought, which the present German Government not only condones, but openly boasts of." A plea by Aaron Douglas, in his paper on "The Negro in American Culture", for support of the Negro people in their struggle against dis- crimination and for economic and cultural equality met with an en- thusiastic response. Subsequently a resolution was passed hailing the first Negro Congress in Chicago. Out of the discussions and papers in the following sessions, centering around social, esthetic and economic problems of artists, resolutions were adopted condemning the reported ban- ning of Sinclair Lewis's motion pic- ture "It Can't Happen Here"; urging the extension of government art projects on a permanent basis adequate to meet the needs of all unemployed artists, and supporting the further building of artists' unions throughout the country as the best means of ad- vancing toward that objective. Dis- patching by the government of artists into CCC camps was sharply disap- proved. Organization of art teachers and students along progressive lines was also advocated. The resolution intro- duced by Katherine Schmidt on be- half of the Society of Painters, Sculp- tors and Gravers asking artists not to exhibit in museums that refuse to pay rental for the use of art works was accepted. Reports by the famous mural painter J. C. Orozco and by David Siqueiros, two of the eight Mexican delegates to the convention, on prob- lems of organized Mexican artists in relation to their social situation were enthusiastically received. In outlining the sphere of activi- ties of the new organization, Stuart Davis pointed out that it could be a powerful agent in stimulating the awakening social consciousness of art- ists and impelling them toward the collective effort essential to realiza- tion of their needs. Among the specific activities planned are the organizing of exhibi- tions against war and fascism, sym- posia and lectures on artistic questions of most immediate import, publication of a journal, cooperative efforts for distribution of mechanically repro- duced art works on a mass scale, etc. While the executive committee will meet in New York City, groups of five or more members in other re- gions will be recognized as autonomous units developing their own activities within the general outline determined by the national organization. All members of the Congress are automatically eligible for membership in the League of American Artists, and new applications are being con- sidered on the same basis as those for the congress.
