<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE EXPRESSIONIST STYLE IN EARLY IRANIAN ART BY D. TALBOT RICE T HE WHOLE PROBLEM OF THE ORIGIN OF WHAT IS GENERALLY KNOWN AS THE MESOPOTAMIAN or Baghdad school in Islamic painting has recently been examined by I. Stchoukine,' and his conclusions as to the preponderance of the influence exercised by the Sasanian element on the development of that school can no longer be disputed. Byzantine influence did, indeed, have a part to play, but it was not, as E. Blochet suggested, the role of a protagonist;2 rather it was an influence affecting superficialities only. It is to be seen, for instance, in the types of many of the faces, and also in much of the coloring, more especially in the use of gold. Essentially Byzantine again is the custom of indicating the folds of the stuffs of which costumes are made; the East prefers to portray them as solid, boardlike materials on which the elaborate woven patterns that were popular there can be displayed and appreciated to full effect. But it is only in such features that Byzantine influence is to be seen. The fundamental spirit of the art re- mains quite distinct, and it is something which is essentially Iranian. Stchoukine regarded this spirit as Sasanian, and there can be no doubt as to the influence of Sasanian style on Islamic painting, as well as of Sasanian art in the sphere of iconography. T. W. Arnold has already cited a number of instances in proof of this,3 and though examples could be multiplied, it is not my purpose to do so here. Rather do I intend to trace further than Stchoukine was able to do the history of the style which he believes to be Sasanian, having regard to certain recent researches into the art of Iran at an earlier period, and more especially to those of Rostovtzev. At the outset it will be well to define in my own terms what I believe to be the essentials of Sasanian style, insofar as it affects Islamic painting. In essence it may perhaps be best described by borrowing a term more generally used in writings on the most recent art, namely '4 expressionist." Paintings that are to be described under this head are not closely bound by nature. They do not so much seek to portray any particular object, person, or animal, or even to give an impression of the subject as caught in the sudden vision of a moment, as to render the spirit of the thing concerned, so that it expresses itself and all that appertains to it with the greatest possible force. The art is not bound by vision or by appearances so much as by the underlying idea; it is not the body, but rather the spirit, that the artist concentrates on reproducing, or rather, on expressing. Some particular feature of the model is generally seized upon and accentuated, or even exaggerated, as in caricature, in order to attain this end; but whereas in caricature the main object is humorous, in "expressionism" it is the opposite, and the deepest emotions of life are dealt with. This process may be conscious, as it is in the art I La Peinture iranienne (Bruges, I936). 2 Muisulzen Painting (London, I929). 3 Survivals of Sasanian and Manichaean Art in Persian Painting (Oxford, I924), and Painting in Islam (Oxford, I928).</page><page sequence="2">THE EXPRESSIONIST STYLE IN EARLY IRANIAN ART 2I7 of today, or it may be almost entirely unconscious, as it probably was in ancient Iran. The results, though not in any sense akin, are comparable when regarded from the point of view of psychological aesthetics. That the majority of paintings that are classed under the heading "Mesopotamian School" are to be described as "expressionist" is at once obvious, if we look at them critically. A few typical examples may be referred to by way of illustration. Most obvious are the studies of single objects or animals, like the numerous trees, plants, or beasts which appear as illustra- tions to any copy of the works of Dioscorides; that of the thirteenth century in the Meshed shrine may be cited.4 These trees are not close portrayals of any individual, or even of any known trees, but they express nevertheless as well as it is possible to conceive all that is intrin- sically "treeish." The typical Persian lions, which appear so often on pottery and metal work, are again not exact replicas, nor are they what Cezanne would have called "like"; but they have beyond question a vividness and vitality that not only conveys all that appertains to the animal, but also gives the object they decorate something that is well nigh a life of its own in the animal world. The same approach is again clearly to be seen in the famous camels on a page of the Schefer Harirl.' Close packed and rhythmical in their treatment, they express with amazing clarity all that is essentially camelish. The grunts and moans, the snorting and chew- ing, the very pungent smell of the beasts can all be sensed here probably more vividly than would be possible in a less stylized and less abstract rendering. Apart from the nature of the style, paintings of this group are also to be distinguished by certain more tangible features, all of which have been alluded to by Stchoukine. Most notable is the portrayal of figures and backgrounds on a single plane; only at a later date, when a new manner intrudes from the East, does a multiplication of planes begin. As a result, the work tends to be effective because of its rhythm and the intricacy of its pattern, for with the single plane three dimensionalism is necessarily subordinate. The art is, however, not severe and ascetic, as two-dimensional art so frequently tends to be,6 but is colorful, vivid, and spon- taneous. The treatment on the single plane runs in the happiest accord with the "expression- ist" understanding. We know but little of Sasanian painting, but what we do know shows us that it must have been of exactly similar character. The few fragments of wall paintings that have survived exhibit the same bright colors, the same single planes, and the same vividness. The metal work is again in this forceful style,7 while the superb figures of the rock reliefs, though they have depth and true sculptural feeling, are also invariably shown on a single plane. Usually they are restricted to two figures face to face, as in the well-known investiture scenes, but 4 L. Binyon, J. V. S. Wilkinson, and B.

TALBOT RICE even where more complicated subjects, comprising numerous figures, appear, they are divided into a series of registers, separated from one another by bands, the figures in each series appearing one behind the other on a single plane.8 Even at Tak-i Bustan, where the dividing lines are omitted, the figures are shown in a series of parallel rows, one above the other.9 It was not, however, in Sasanian art that such things appeared for the first time. The single plane and many of the other features characteristic of Sasanian art, more especially some of the subjects, were known long before in the flourishing Achaemenid age, and it is hence to a certain extent true to say, as many writers have done, that Sasanian art constituted a renaissance of what had existed in Iran before the intrusion of Greek elements at the time of Alexander. But such a statement is not entirely true, for there is a very distinct difference between the Sasanian and early Islamic styles on the one hand and the Achaemenid on the other, in that the former are, as I have attempted to show by citing examples from early Islamic times, essentially "expressionist," whereas Achaemenid art was straightforwardly, and sometimes even rather prosaically, naturalistic. It may at times use symbolism, in that it por- trays certain objects that are recognizable as symbols for something else or as symbolical of some religious theme, but the art is never symbolical in spirit, as was much of Sasanian art, and it can never be termed abstract. In Achaemenid art all is to be seen clearly on the surface; in Sasanian much of the meaning is esoteric, and much of the emotion that we experience on beholding its products is due to what is left to the imagination-it is an art that stimulates the imagination rather than satisfies it. The "expressionist" style was thus born after Achaemenid times, though it was fully developed by Sasanian. In actual fact it first grew up in the intervening Parthian age, and two series of monuments survive to bear witness to its growth, one in South Russia and the other in northern Mesopotamia. In religious art the most important example is afforded by the rock sculptures of Antiochus I of Commagene at Nimruid Dagh, of 34 B.c.10 The whole appearance of the relief savors of deep mysticism, and, with its symbolism and abstraction, it is the very expression of the esoteric sun cult with which it was associated. The secular monu- ments are made up in the main of banqueting and hunting scenes and are of the same sym- bolical character; they also have a semireligious significance, on and above the purely sporting context. Later and more spectacular examples are afforded by the numerous tomb paintings of Kertch and Panticapaeum of the second century A.D."1 Earlier ones, in painting, which are purely Parthian, have recently been discovered by the Yale expedition at Dura; that they did not stand alone is proved by the close similarity that they show with monuments from Palmyra, both in painting and in sculpture. The history and whole nature of these monuments have recently been brilliantly analyzed 8 Most notable are two reliefs at Shapiir, one on the south side of the valley, in eight panels (ibid., P1. 72), and one on the north side, in four registers (ibid., P1. 77). These two reliefs are wrongly described in the legend to Sarre's plates as the same. 9 Ibid., Pls. 86 and 87. 10 Ibid., P1. 56. 11 M.

The style, in the secular as well as in the religious sphere, is of an esoteric, "expressionist" character, and at Nimrud Dagh we have a monument that can at very first sight be associated with a mysterious sun cult such as Mith- raism, rather than with an anthropomorphic religious faith like that of Greece. Both in Greece, and to a great extent also in Achaemenid Persia, where flourished the two civilizations from which Parthian culture was derived, straightforwardness and explicitness were above anything else the hallmarks of thought and art. We learned in algebra that two minuses made a plus, and here we seem to have the same thing in art, for the blend between the Achaemenid and Greek cultures which was accom- plished in Mesopotamia between about 300 and IOO B.C. made out of the two cultures, one of which was essentially, and the other to a great extent, explicit, a culture which turned out to be of exactly opposite character. Here ideas in religious thought were muddled and compli- cated, and the lack of clarity was dissembled under a cloak of mystery. Hand in hand with this trend in philosophy there ran a similar trend in art. At the outset the art that resulted was little more than the consequence of an inability to think or conceive clearly; it was an uncon- scious attempt to hide ineptitude under a cloak of abstraction. But it soon developed into a definite style, where abstraction became an aim in itself, and work of real quality was often produced, though it was the inner or emotional side that was stressed rather than that of representation or external beauty. This stressing of inner meaning rather than outward appearance has tended to bring about a general neglect of the history of this style, and even such writers as have admitted its separate existence have often dismissed it as nothing but a manifestation of incompetence. The classical specialists have thus discarded the greater part of Hellenistic art, where the manner is clearly apparent, as nothing but decadence; the Romanists have condemned works which show the presence of the manner as nothing but the result of Eastern maladroitness; the archaeologists, like Herzfeld, have regarded the style, as for instance at Samarra, as the last expiring breath of a sterile Romano-Sasanid hybrid; the medievalists, like Blochet, have attributed its presence in the miniatures of the Mesopotamian school to an inability to copy Byzantine models correctly. All such estimations have in reality been very far from the mark, for the movement was without doubt something ordered and consecutive, as well as something inevitable. It was born, as Rostovtzev has shown, in the Parthian period, as the result of cer- tain religious and cultural changes, thanks to the suppression of the old Achaemenid court art by the Greek invasion. It was fostered, thanks to its sponsorship, by an esoteric religion, and it became at the same time the concrete expression of that religion and the mirror of a very distinct cultural phase. It was developed to the full during the Sasanian age and became 12 "Dura and the Problem of Parthian Art," Yale Classical Studies, V (1936), I55-304.

It survived for the next five centuries in Iraq and Iran in the miniature paintings of the Mesopotamian school. Only with the introduction from the East at the end of the thirteenth century of the new Mongol manner, with its feathery lightness and its idealization, did the "expressionist" style begin to decline. It cropped up again with amazing purity in certain later works, as for instance in some of the miniatures of the Edinburgh al-Birfini of I3o7,13 in some of those of al-Kazwlni's 'Adjd'ib al-Makhlfikat of the fifteenth century at Leningrad,"4 or in a painting in the Sarre collection of the angel who will sound the last trumpet at the Resurrection.'5 But these are single examples. In the main the "expressionist" style was overcome in the fourteenth century by a new art which we know as something intrinsically Persian, and in which Chinese elements play quite an important part. Outside Iran the "expressionist" style exercised a wide influence in the West and in the East. In the latter direction, a considerable number of Manichaean paintings can be cited as examples,'6 as well as others which are Buddhist in context.'7 In the West Millet has shown the full importance of the Syrian realist manner in the history of Byzantine painting, and all the characteristics of this art coincide with those of our "expressionist" style and were cer- tainly the outcome of it." J. Strzygowski too has had cause to refer to it in Christian art, more especially with regard to what he terms the "Hvarenah landscapes," compositions of Iranian inspiration, the character of which was determined, not by fidelity to nature, but by the symbolic value. The mosaics in the apse of St. Apollinare in Classe at Ravenna afford an instance of the occurrence of this symbolical landscape in Byzantine art.'9 The "expression- ist" style was, in fact, carried far afield both by numerous waves of migrating peoples and also by "peaceful penetration," and it is to be counted as one of the fundamental styles at the basis of medieval art. If a thirteenth-century illumination of the Mesopotamian school does not seem out of place beside a contemporary European work, it is not so much because there are certain Byzantine elements to be seen in both, as Blochet would assert, but because the "expressionist" style exercised its effect on the West as well as on the East. It is a style the existence of which we cannot afford to disregard, and one which will come more and more into prominence as our examination of Sasanian and Parthian monuments proceeds. And the more we examine the style from the aesthetic point of view, the more do we come to realize how true was Strzygowski's suggestion that medieval art was born in Iran about the first century before Christ. 13T.
