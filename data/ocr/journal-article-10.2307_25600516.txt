<plain_text><page sequence="1">BRUCE CLARKE Fabulous Monsters of Conscience: Anthropomorphosis in Keats's Lamia I Epiphany of Hermes Human nature abhors a vacuum. Even though one speaks of the absent center, the evacuation of inwardness, depthless surfaces, the death of God, one must always do so from some perspective, ironic or not. So one speaks to one side or another, either the displaced or the displacing center, the incoming or the outcast agent. For in the imagi nation as well as in the political sphere a new center immediately rushes in to usurp any vacancy. Even gods must defend their thrones, insofar as their powers are a product of sheer position. Keats's Lamia is con cerned with such problems?the proper and improper placement of agents and the displacement of one agent by another?for Lamia herself is an incoming, then outcast agent, who will be accused of dispossessing another, who will then be dispossessed herself. Out of such existential topography Keats makes the metamorphic machinery of the poem ap pear.1 Lamia is a daemonic romance tracing the placings and displacings involved in the bargains by which consciences are constructed, the furtive relations holding between the sexual and the spiritual for the i.

On whatever theoretical horizon we examine it, the house image would appear to have become the topography of our intimate being" (xxxii). Lamia's topography, however, traces the principle of disintegration conveyed by improper homes and home lessness altogether. On this more problematic topography see Tony Tanner, Adultery in the Novel (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins U. Press, 1979), especially "City, Field, and Temple" and "The Stranger in the House" (pp. 18-52).

Moreover, Lamia is a demonstration that the forms of poetic ex changes and transferences underwrite all other human economies.3 Keats begins Lamia with a bit of mythic history dislocating his own historical perspective, immediately placing his narrator at an ironic tem poral vantage: Upon a time, before the faery broods Drove Nymph and Satyr from the prosperous woods, Before King Oberon's bright diadem, Sceptre, and mantel, clasp'd with dewy gem, Frighted away the Dryads and the Fauns From rushes green, and brakes, and cowslip'd lawns, (1.1-6) Keats's opening veils with fairy-tale commonness the sterner historical stuff of racial conquests, theological rivalries, and ancient imperialisms. In a fable of political displacement, two mythic groups contest one mythical homeland, and in time prosperity changes hands, passing al ways to the owners of the land. The newer Teutonic, Christian, olden English "broods" of King Oberon usurp the territories formerly pos sessed by the ancient pagan nature spirits; territorial possession is the condition and thus a figure for all other proprieties. "Upon a time, before" the time of this legendary theft and expulsion, Keats conjures up "the rake of gods, " Hermes?Olympian herald and patron god of thieves, merchants, lovers, democratic suffrage and luck at the lottery, 2.

In The Political Unconscious (Ithaca: Cornell U.

In my essay "Metamorphic Romance: The Scene-Agent Ratio, The Sublime, The Narrative of Dynamic Affect" currently submitted for publication I work out this partic ular point at full length. There I discuss the appropriateness of a vocabulary which in this essay I simply put to use. For "tenor" and "vehicle" see I. A. Richards, The Philosophy of Rhetoric (New York: Oxford U.

Stealth ily Hermes gives Jove the slip as he vacates his "golden throne," evi dently sure enough of his own power to leave his seat unattended, seemingly secure that during this absence no uninvited guest will dis possess him: The ever-smitten Hermes empty left His golden throne, bent warm on amorous theft: From high Olympus had he stolen light, On this side of Jove's clouds, to escape the sight Of his great summoner, and made retreat Into a forest on the shores of Crete. (1.7-12)5 "Hermes is the hero of stealthy appropriation," remarks Norman O. Brown in Hermes the Thief, putting the accent more on the stealth than on the appropriation; "when the Greek tragedians describe Hermes as 'tricky' or as 'the trickster, ' they have in mind not a patron of theft or any other type of misappropriation, but a patron of stealthy action in general" (pp. 7,8). That Keats has Hermes immediately steal off toward "amorous theft" is doubly accurate; Hermes was often found in league with Aphrodite, to the point of virtual fusion in the figure of Herma phroditus: "this association was undoubtedly due to the fact that both cults operated in the realm of love-magic" (Brown, p. 15). Walter Otto remarks of Hermes, "he must once have struck the eye as a brilliant flash out of the depths."6 Thus Keats's opening image of Hermes as already in motion; according to Karl Kerenyi: "Hermes is constantly 4-James D. Boulger, "Keats' Symbolism," in ELH 28:3 (September 1961), 244-259: "is this relationship between Hermes and the Nymph intended primarily as an example of ideal love? If so, why Hermes, the rake of gods, and a mere nymph?" (p. 250). I am indebted to Norman O. Brown's compact sociohistorical study of the "Homeric Hymn to Hermes," Hermes the Thief (1947; rpt. New York: Vintage, 1969). A contemporary translation of the "Hymn" is given in Charles Boer, The Homeric Hymns (Chicago: Swal low, 1970), pp. 22-61.

Lamia herself, it may be said, is on a long journey of uncertain destination. Crossing paths with Hermes, however, may not be the lucky break she is looking for. One encounters Hermes especially on the road to hell; so Keats at one point names Hermes "the star of Lethe" (1.81). The opening of the last book of the Odyssey presents Hermes in this role; Chapman's version runs: Cyllenian Hermes with his golden rod The wooers' so?les (that yet retain'd abod[e] Amids their bodies) call'd in dreadfull rout Forth to th'Infernals, who came murmuring out.7 Brown mentions the excavation of "cursing tablets," the word for which in Greek "means 'bindings,' and a number of them invoke Hermes as 'the one who holds down' or, as we say, 'the spellbinder.' Because of his power to bind and to release, Hermes was the god who prevented the souls of the dead from leaving the tomb" (p. 13). Jane Harrison discusses the opposition in the figure of Hermes between the winged messenger and the ponderous, immobile stone Herrn, "a rude pillar later surmounted by a head," to the point that a late ancient fable "makes the god himself voice the dilemma: was he a tombstone, was he an im mortal?"8 In light of Hermes' role as psychopomp, the guide of departed souls, the god who ferries psyches or transfers unbound essences from one realm to another, we can see in Hermes too a god of metaphor, the quick and brilliant transfer of image and meaning from one term to another. But unlike the Apollonian poetic genius enforcing clarity and harmony, Hermes' genius concerns rhetoric, verbal magic, business transactions, skill at the oath, linguistic stealth: "Hermes is the master of the magic formulae which bind" (Brown, p. 14).9 Keats chose Hermes to center the story of a languishing metamorph? a being bound down to a reptilian abode by some immediately inex plicable curse?to focus the ironic undercurrent of a daemonic romance. 7- Chapman's Homer, ed.

So too will this story involve the furtive intrigues of a shady triangle, each of whom is out to steal away from, steal upon, steal from, or steal the other. And more broadly, under the aegis of Hermes and in Lamia's terms one can study metaphor not in its ideal properness but in its necessary impropriety?metaphor as theft and as curse, as the stealthy appropriation of the essences of terms by other terms and as the holding down of terms by other terms. Hermes presides over the metempsy choses of linguistic agents. In this frame of analysis, terms and persons are interchangeable: they are both "linguistic agents" occupying scenes. Metaphor is the linguistic, metamorphosis the psychological figure bound up with the attributes of Hermes: exchanging and expropriating, possessing and dispossessing, binding and unbinding, holding down and setting free. Metaphor and metamorphosis may be factored together by the fol lowing formula: metaphor brings about two agents within one scene? metamorphosis brings about the displacement of an agent from one scene to another. Metaphor establishes figurative, implicit transfers of significance, which may then be made explicit, literalized by metamor phoses that turn the inward- and outwardness of qualities inside out, rendering the inner or essential scenic?visible and material?making the scenic invisible and immaterial. The first twelve lines of Lamia move from metaphor to metamorphosis: through a dispossessive metaphor equating then substituting "Nymph and Satyr" with "faery broods," Oberon enters and overtakes the "prosperous woods," driving out the superannuated pagan sprites; carried backward by mythical retrospective and forward by possessive momentum, Hermes leaves his throne empty and darts from the scene of Olympus to the scene of Crete. His remove suggests the formula for a metamorphosis?the same agent within a new scene?literally fulfilled by Lamia. When a metaphor initiates a metamorphosis, it is dispossessive metaphor, Hermes' linguistic ge nius.10 In the anthropomorphic imagination this formula can be stated: met io. My most immediate debts here are to Irving Massey, The Gaping Pig: Literature and Metamorphosis (Berkeley: U. of California Press, 1976) and Stanley Corngold, "Kafka's Die Verwandlung: Metamorphosis of the Metaphor," in Mosaic 3 (Summer 1970), pp. 91 106.

For instance: "my love is like a red, red rose. " Comprehending the figure immediately exchanges the image of the beloved for that of the rose; but at the same time the essence of the rose is appropriated by the tenor, drawn into the woman. But as long as these two agents participate or share out to each other their linguistic abode, the figure blossoms. The significance of a metaphor is mediated by images but not bound to them, for metaphor's intention is to augment the range of affection and thus of significance. At face value metaphor is an ameliorative figure signifying an erotic transfer; it amplifies essences by intermingling or interchanging two tenors within one vehicle, binding two or more affects to the same idea, moving psychic qualities purposely among the objects and projects of the world. But metaphor also insures that meaning ajways changes its address and thus must be kept up with, must be maintained. To stay abreast of your own meaning you have to act on it; otherwise you get possessed and turn into a vehicle for another's meaning. This is because metaphor is always potentially daemonic: structurally it presents an unstable relation, a potential clash of agencies within the same scene. Figures are doubled signs, signs doubled over: scenes in which relations may pass from participatory to possessive. Participation turns daemonic when one of the participating agents is possessed or dispossessed by another. Dispossessive metaphor leads to metamorpho sis once the usurping agent makes over the original scene in its own image; the mark of the usurping agent now determines the appearance of the scene. Metamorphosis represents the casting out of some agent, which must cast about for a new scene; that soul now wanders through different bodies, or as in romantic narrative, that agent now wanders in quest of a proper home. Just as the tenor of a figure may have predicated to it an infinite series of vehicles, a vehicle once inducted may overpower the original tenor. One way that figuration turns uncanny is for the vehicle not to stay put but to overmaster the tenor; another way is when the tenor is already the vehicle for a previous tenor, to the detriment of the new vehicle. Romance is the anthropomorphizing of the figures of defense: meta il.

Instead of being familiar powers and common properties, eros and capital remain un canny and needlessly cruel. Thus the terror at the heart of human participation and the coupling of lust and greed: the figurations that bring about participatory relations can end in dispossessive ones. II Lamia's First Life To take seriously if not entirely literally at least this much of the ser pentine Lamia's story?"I was a woman, let me have once more / A woman's shape"?would be to understand the fate of Lamia in relation to Apollonius as a representation of the dispossession of the feminine generally and specifically of the casting out of the feminine from the masculine psyche. Critics of Lamia have had little to say about the role of gender in the poem. On this topic the discussion has not advanced much beyond the stereotypical moralization of gender in describing Keats's stylistic development: so, for instance, Douglas Bush remarked on "the masculine and classic style of the sonnet on Chapman, " com menting that "the manner of Endymion is largely that of/ Stood Tip-Toe and Sleep and Poetry, luscious, half-feminine, and often beautiful."13 This line of discussion ends up moralizing Keats's development as the struggle to discover a capable masculine poetic identity, as this is thought to be traced in his crossover from effeminate, narcissistic lyrical to more robust ironic and comprehensive dramatic modes. Again in Bush's loaded phrases for Keats's later self-questionings: "If [the poet's] exis tence is justified, can he allow his imagination to be self-centered, in the 12. Freud, "The Unconscious": "The psycho-analytic assumption of unconscious mental activity appears to us, on the one hand, as a further expansion of the primitive animism which caused us to see copies of our own consciousness all around us, and, on the other hand, as an extension of the corrections undertaken by Kant of our views on external perception," Standard Edition, ?d. Strachey et al (London, 1953-66), vol. 14, p. 171. Harold Bloom, "Freud and the Poetic Sublime": "Current American thinkers . . . describe psychic defenses as fantasies, not mechanisms, and fantasies are always tropes. ... A fantasy of defense is thus, in language, the recursive process that traditional rhetoric named a trope or 'turning,' or even a 'color,'" Freud: A Collection of Critical Essays, ed. Meisel (Englewood Cliffs: Prentice Hall, 1981), p. 212. If a trope is a "color": Lamia's fantastic appearance may be a complex figure for figuration in general: "She was a gordian shape of dazzling hue, / Vermilion-spotted, golden, green, and blue" (1.47-48). 13.

But as Hermes knows, all boundaries are shifty and must be bargained over; boundaries are therefore always subject to disingenuous defini tions. A prime example here is Apollonius himself, who identifies Lamia as a Lamia?a treacherous feminine monster?when all along he knows that she is as human as he is. At least, this will be my thesis. Gender and genre figure strongly if ambiguously in Lamia, where the meta morphic license allows the poet to cut across numerous generic bound aries: male and female; lyrical, narrative, and dramatic; straight and ironic; bestial, human, and divine. To recast the allegory more neutrally, the poem represents the fable of a poet's inability to protect his own psyche?the vital fiction of an essential person?from efficient reduction by the negativity of his own spirit. If in his last work Keats was strug gling to supersede the Lamian fancy in his own genius, it was only because he wanted greater strength to bring to its protection. Garrett Stewart has given close attention to the problem of Lamia's past, carefully tracing Keats's allusions to Ariadne, Proserpine, and Circe, female figures who suffer desertion and transformation, rape and exile, who inflict or suffer metamorphoses: "Proserpine pines, like Lamia, for her proper bearing as an earthly woman. . . . 'Circean' . . . describes not Lamia's present appearance or powers so much as the lamented transformation which has brought her to this state."14 In Lem priere's Classical Dictionary, one of Keats's standard references, the entry on "LAML4E" records one tradition giving the Lamia a past to account for its reptilian state: "Certain monsters of Africa, who had the face and breast of a woman, and the rest of their body like that of a serpent. They allured strangers to come to them, that they might devour them. . . . According to some, the fable of the Lamiae is derived from the amours of Jupiter with a certain beautiful woman called Lamia, whom the jealousy of Juno rendered deformed, and whose children she destroyed; upon which Lamia became insane, and so desperate that she eat up all the children that came in her way" (nth ed., 1820). Keats's suggestiveness concerning a prior life for Lamia may derive from his knowledge of this report, which in his verse would be transformed thus: "Her head was serpent, but ah, bitter-sweet! / She had a woman's mouth with all its pearls complete" (1.59-60). If we place Lempriere's report behind the Hermes episode Keats added to Burton's retelling out of Philostratus' De Vita Apollonii, we can see the serpentine Lamia Ian 14- Garrett Stewart, "Lamia and the Language of Metamorphosis," in Studies in Roman ticism 15:1 (Winter 1976), 13-14.</page><page sequence="9">ANTHROPOMORPHOSE IN KEATS'S LAMIA 563 guishing in Crete as already the victim of a divine rape and retribution that have left her deformed, mad, and abandoned in Aphrodite's myth ical outback. Jupiter's destructive dalliance here is of a piece with Olym pian patriarchal prerogatives, one paradigm of which is the parable of the "ever-smitten" Hermes' conquest of the nymph. We can get more light on the Hermes episode by recalling what is possibly its progenitor, the beginning of Book 5 of the Odyssey, summed up in Chapman's argument thus: "A Second Court on Jove attends, / Who Hermes to Calypso sends, / Commanding her to cleare the wayes I Ulysses sought; and she obayes."15 Here too Hermes departs Olympus and releases a captive stranded on a nymph's island. In Homer he is merely a herald, the sign of another's power, a delegate representing Jove's authority, bitterly resented by Calypso (5.153 ff); but in Keats he is his own authority, self-signifying, so long as he gives father Jove the slip, and Lamia, forewarned of his arrival by a dream, seizes the opportunity to be released from her curse. If the phases of Lamia as languishing captive and amorous captor combine Ulysses and Calypso, so Apollonius as liberator and conqueror is a parody of Lamia and of the Hermes who releases Lamia only in order to devour the independent being of the nymph. However, the question remains: if Lamia was a woman once before, who imprisoned her in the serpent prison-house? Here is Calypso complaining to Hermes about the divine jealousies and Jovian authority forcing her to release Odysseus; her argument is essentially, "I took him in when he was down, who is Jove to make me give him up?" '. . . . Him, cast upon this coast With blasts and billowes, I (in life given lost) Preserv'd alone, lov'd, nourisht, and did vow To make him deathlesse . . .' (5.178-81) Compare Apollonius at the end of Lamia explaining to Lycius why he has come to "release" him from Lamia's clutches, an explanation that will seem especially ironic later when we consider Apollonius' serpentine attributes: "Fool! Fool!" repeated he, while his eyes still Relented not, nor mov'd; "from every ill 15- Chapman's Homer, ed. Nicoll, vol. 2, p. 88. In "Notes on Keats's Reading," PMLA 50:3 (September 1935), 785-806, Douglas Bush speculates concerning the Hermes episode that it "seems to be much elaborated from the story of Mercury, Herse, and Aglauros, at the end of the second book of the Metamorphoses" (p. 789).</page><page sequence="10">564 BRUCE CLARKE Of life have I preserv'd thee to this day, And shall I see thee made a serpent's prey?" (11.295-98) Apollonius echoes Calypso's protest, the perennial protest of all de fense departments: he is not a tyrant but a preserver from ill. And so he claims the captive pupil Lycius as his own property, paid for by the labor of his mastery, his protection and defense. But Apollonius, unlike Homer's Calypso but like Keats's Hermes, is not beholden to a Jovian decree; the philosopher is his own little god. Like Hermes once Lamia has delivered the goods by rendering the nymph visible and thus pos sessable, he exercises the free power of his desire upon the being he has recognized. Some notion of "philosophic acumen and virtue" is not sufficient to account for Apollonius' recognition and the virulence of his power. Apollonius' humanity is at least as questionable as Lamia's dae monic status. The two are rather, if not equal, at least qualitatively comparable, players in an intrigue that has left the all-too-human Lycius far behind.16 Apollonius knows Lamia: shall we say, it takes a thief to know one? Ill Lamia's Tomb One difficulty Lamia poses for stable interpretation involves the impos sibility of answering the serpentine Lamia's first utterance, her definitive and insurmountable questioning of her own existence?"When from this wreathed tomb shall I awake!" (1.38)?since in fact at the poem's end Apollonius' furious stare banishes her from the living human scene. She awakens to her magical Corinthian life with Lycius only to be exposed as a fabulous monster and cast out, thrust back into the tomb: "He look'd and look'd again a level?No! / 'A Serpent!' echoed he; no sooner said, / Than with a frightful scream she vanished" (11.304-6). But if Lamia is not or not only a serpent, then Apollonius' curse may be considered a dispossessive metaphor initiating a reverse metamor phosis, effectively banishing her agency along with her entire scene, her "haunting music, sole perhaps and lone / Supportress of the faery-roof" (11.122-23).17 As a banisher producing a vanishing, Apollonius is equiv alent to Oberon and his hordes: he is a displacer, an authority enforcing a territorial exile. i6. Cf. Morris Dickstein, Keats and His Poetry (Chicago: U. of Chicago Press, 1971), P. 234. 17. Stewart draws out Lamia's genius for the scenic, "the carefully developed corre spondence between Lamia's imagination and the external space it creates. . . . Her essence has been . . . thoroughly projected in the symbolic decor" (pp. 25, 28).</page><page sequence="11">ANTHROPOMORPHOSIS IN KEATS'S LAMIA 565 Readings of Lamia divide along the moralization of this concluding exorcism: is Apollonius' relentless destruction a caustic applied to a corruption?Apollo's healing rational sunshine burning out a pocket of darkness?thus a hard but unavoidable sacrifice enabling the poet to supersede his own immaturity, or is it a blight blotting out a life, and blotting it out again and again, repetitively?18 Charles Patterson consid ers Apollonius a prosaic "center of intelligence" in an otherwise fool hardy fable concerning Lycius, a young man "far gone in the labyrinths of the daemonic" (pp. 209, 207). Nevertheless, he has noticed how the verse suggests for Lamia "a possible earlier stage of existence than the serpentine," such that her Cretan existence as a serpent may be a "pe nance . . . possibly for having once accepted a daemon lover," and he offers this explanation: "the notion that Lamia is being changed back again from serpent to woman" is "a process of exorcising the sinister, and hence most of the suggestion of evil, in the serpentine without expelling all its mysterious glamour, power, and appeal" (pp. 194, 196). I think there is more to it than this; but Patterson concurs that the question of Lamia's existence prior to her serpentine form is significant. Unlike Patterson, those who take up Apollonius' view usually ignore Lamia's prior being, for its possibility confounds the identification of metamorphic female with malign serpentine essence. Some speak not of Lamia but about "the Lamia," thereby distancing their rhetoric from Lamia's possible personhood and setting aside her ontological ambigu ities once and for all: Lamia is the serpent, and thus her professed sleep in the "serpent prison-house" is a lie and of a piece with her other deceptions. Donald Pear ce is the most notable of the recent commen tators to side with Apollonius; but although he cites Patterson's discus sion approvingly, by ignoring the suggestions concerning Lamia's prior life he returns to the figure of Lamia the malignancy that Patterson had 18. In addition to Boulger (pp. 249-50), Bush (pp. 109-15), Dickstein (pp. 239-41), and Stewart (pp. 8-14, 37-39), the Hermes episode is significantly treated in the following works: Edward T.

Pearce sees the figure of Lamia as a deliberately parodie creation; her fate represents on Keats's part a necessary valediction: "Fancy," the lower imagination of the dreamer, must be forsworn so that the maturing poet may come to be. He must slough off his gaudy past and by "casting the self" emerge reborn. On a more despairing note, Barry Gradman argues that because Lamia's "original, essential state of being is unknowable . . . the figure of Lamia defies moral evaluation," a situation constituting as with Pearce a "deliberate self-parody on Keats's part," but one that represents not a step forward but "a cynical undermining of one of his deepest imaginative impulses" (pp. 104, 105). Harold Skulsky offers an effective counter to Pearce's reductive allegory and Gradman's moral impasse: "The gist of Apollonius' theory of Lamia is that in some fundamental sense she is nothing but a serpent ... a theory that the poem as a whole refuses to sustain. . . . Even if Lamia's nature were entirely unknown, it would follow neither that she is unreal nor that her nature cannot be known. But in fact, though her biological species? if any?eludes us, we are reliably informed not only that she assumes bodies but that she thinks and feels. The nature of Lamia, as it concerns us, is that she is a person" (pp. 163-65).19 Skulsky's approach correctly positions one issue of Lamia's signifi cance: insofar as a complete reading of the poem must involve at least a phase of affective identification, Lamia is the name of a person unsig nified by any allegory, a person gathered by the reader's feelings. Never theless, the person and the poem Lamia's incorrigible shiftiness, more fundamentally Keats's astonishingly ironic delivery, cannot be avoided; Meg Williams is right to say that "in 'snuffing out' the illusions of one Lycius who thought he was a poet, Keats in effect attacks the reader by confusing his sympathies" (p. 171). And even granting the humane positivity of Skulsky's reading, if Lamia is a person, if the "I" who implores awakening from a "wreathed tomb" signifies a captive or spellbound personhood and not merely a sinister principle or a cynical 19. Patterson's discussion of Lamia is marred not by using Jung but by using him too superficially; Patterson presents Apollonius as if he were the Jungian archetype of the "wise old man" in benign aspect, when surely Keats presents him in malefic aspect. Similarly Pearce treats the figure of Apollo as if his light threw no shadows, and so bases his championing of Apollonius on an unsatisfactory contrast between a valiant Apollo and a corrupt Hermes. Pearce's attempt to save Keats for masculinist appreciation founders on this misapprehension. Pseudo-Jungians tend to bypass or misplace the shadows.</page><page sequence="13">ANTHROPOMORPHOSIS IN KEATS'S LAMIA 567 snare, then how did this person come to inform the body of a snake? Or less fabulously, what else might it mean that Keats has suggested for her a prior human existence disrupted by a rude metamorphosis? If Lamia enjoyed a human life prior to her serpentine state, then her banishment and vanishing at the end of the poem represent at least a second alienation from the human, although into what cannot be said. Lamia presents the figure of a vanisher, a perpetual exile who must take whatever form her circumstances may permit.20 In this, what does Lamia stand for, what has she had to put up with, such that her person becomes the scene of such fabulous suffering? "When from this wreathed tomb shall I awake! When move in a sweet body fit for life, And love, and pleasure, and the ruddy strife Of hearts and lips! Ah, miserable me!" (1.38-41) A metamorph speaking in figures calls out to Hermes in the first bold metaphor of the narrative. In fact, her cry is composed of two figures: "this body is a tomb" and "being in this body is like the sleep of death." The attribute "wreathed" refers literally to the braided geometric scales of her snakeskin, but figuratively reinforces the gist of her metaphors? that her metamorphosis is like having died?for a wreath is also the garland laid on a grave, the mark of a commemorative gesture for a departed soul. By her own account Lamia is clearly the ?ject?e of a dispossessive metaphor, that is, she has been transformed and held down by a curse, and now lies outcast and spellbound. However derived, within her imprisonment Lamia has curious liberties, her clairvoyance and power over the nymph. But just as Hermes is powerless to discover the nymph without Lamia's consent, so is she powerless to liberate herself without his aid. Here is a strange bargain in the making. Lamia has a stake to bargain with for her release, her genius for the scenic, a pure tincture of "the feminine." Her possessive desires are twofold and both scenic in nature. "Place me where he is" reenacts "give me my woman's form": to be removed from the tomb of her serpentine 20. Cf. D. H. Lawrence's late treatment of the pagan Magna Mater exiled by the Christian era: "She has been in the desert ever since, the great cosmic Mother crowned with all the signs of the zodiac. Since she fled, we have had nothing but virgins and harlots, half-women: the half-women of the Christian era. For the great Woman of the pagan cosmos was driven into the wilderness at the end of the old epoch, and she has never been called back," Apocalypse, ed. Kalnins (New York: Cambridge U. Press, 1980), p. 121.</page><page sequence="14">568 BRUCE CLARKE form without being removed from the exile of Crete would be to no avail. Consequently the metamorphic formula is doubled?she desires a double displacement from her compound exile. Hermes is quick to swear a clean, binding oath: "Possess whatever bliss thou canst devise, / Telling me only where my nymph is fled" (1.85-86). Lamia quickly makes her proposition: "... by my power is her beauty veil'd To keep it unaffronted, unassail'd. . . . Thou shalt behold her, Hermes, thou alone, If thou wilt, as thou swearest, grant my boon! ... I was a woman, let me have once more A woman's shape, and charming as before. I love a youth of Corinth?O the bliss! Give me my woman's form, and place me where he is." (1.100-120) With regard to the nymph, Lamia is the spellbinder. But since this detail as well as the entire Hermes episode is absent from the story of Lamia transmitted by Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy, why is Keats sharing out attributes between Hermes and Lamia? Unlike the patrician Apollo, Hermes was a patron of the relatively powerless and impoverished, and yet was too urbane for the conservative Hesiod, who disdained him as a promoter of stealthy deceit and "feminine wiles" (Brown, p. 9). Lam ia's ability to withhold and bring forth the nymph is an allegory for the maintenance and abandonment of feminine defenses; it is also typical Hermetic magic: "Hermes [stealing] Ares out of the brazen pot . . . belongs to the folk-tale type of the * demon caught in a bottle or other receptacle.' ... In this type of story both the imprisonment and the release of the demon are magical exercises" (Brown, p. 13). Bargaining, trade, exchange were initially numinous acts, presided over especially by Hermes as the "pillar or her m where the boundaries of two properties met" (Harrison, p. 9), as the patron of economic commerce: "Primitive trade at the boundary was deeply impregnated with magical notions. . . . The exchange is itself a ritual act. ... In the earliest Roman codes acts of legitimate appropriation are still called thefts, jurta" (Brown, pp. 40, 42). In his Genealogy of Morals, Nietzsche remarks: "setting prices, determining values, contriving equivalences, exchanging?these preoccupied the earliest thinking of mankind to so great an extent that in a certain sense they constitute thinking as such."21 21. Friedrich Nietzsche, On the Genealogy of Morals, 11.8, in Basic Writings of Nietzsche</page><page sequence="15">ANTHROPOMORPHOSIS IN KEATS'S LAMIA 569 Perhaps Hermes and Lamia together compose an allegory for the par ticipatory exchange of goods in free commerce, the counterpart of theft and dispossession. Yet insofar as their commerce is a fore-echo of the consummation between Hermes and the nymph Keats leaves unwritten, it is a demonic image for possessive or self-retentive eros. In this role Lamia appears as both the pander and the pandered to; she prostitutes her power. Hermes and Lamia agree to swap possessions, to barter potencies, to enter into a momentary, entirely self-interested participa tion in the other's power. But for Lamia, whose power is circumscribed to her sexuality, only bad bargains are possible. The bargain they strike is like a metaphor that reads both ways. Reading Hermes as the tenor of this figure, it says "a thief of love is a snake in the grass"; reading Lamia as the tenor, it asks "can a woman be held down in a tomb forever?" IV The Basilisk Otto Fenichel has written: With the help of the superego the ego "participates" in the more powerful father's might, and the acquisition of the superego is the equivalent of the acquisition of a trophy. . . . All trophies are some how personified "superegos" [in] that they all have one thing in common with the superego: they both protect and threaten their possessor. As long as one keeps a trophy in one's house, one has the powerful being in the house, and compels it to protect one. But, just as behind the peaceful "participation" there always lurks the original intention of robbing, so is this protection always con ditional too.22 That Lamia portays the processes and perversions of conscience-forma tion is attested to by the changes rung on the theme of trophy-acquisi tion, the dispossessions involved in the collusion between possessiveness and defensiveness introduced in the Hermes episode. As Donald Reiman has pointed out, "Hermes becomes enamored of the nymph not because trans, and ed. Kaufmann (New York: Modern Library, 1968), p. 506. Discussing the relation of guilt (Schuld) to debts (Schulden) a bit earlier, Nietzsche notes that "this pri meval, deeply rooted, perhaps by now ineradicable idea . . . of an equivalence between injury and pain" draws its power from "the contractural relationship between creditor and debtor, which is as old as the idea of 'legal subjects' and in turn points back to the fundamental forms of buying, selling, barter, trade, and traffic," 11.4.499. 22.

The nymph is a trophy, a prize that Hermes desires to add to his collection. Compare Fenichel on the psychology of the collector: "'I have acquired something by force or fraud that originally belonged to someone more powerful, but which is now a talisman for me, or which connects me magically with the previous possessor'" (p. 149). Of course the preeminent prizes in pa triarchal households are the women owned by the father. Hermes slink ing past "his great summoner" Jove is essentially a son-figure intending to raid his father's troves, a divine submitting of the feminine to the status of property. Capturing the nymph, Hermes achieves a relative omnipotence, a disingenuous oedipal victory. But then the superego is built on disingenuousness.23 Notice the anticipation of Fenichel's topic "Trophy and Triumph" in Lycius's characterization of his motives for presenting Lamia to the world of Corinth: What mortal hath a prize, that other men May be confounded and abash'd withal, But lets it sometimes pace abroad majestical, And triumph, as in thee I should rejoice Amid the hoarse alarm of Corinth's voice. (11.57-61) Fenichel defines triumph as "the disappearance of fear and inhibition as a result of the acquisition of the trophy" (p. 159). At this point in the story Lycius feels triumph right enough; he has forgotten entirely his fear and inhibition concerning his shadowy mentor Apollonius, "the ghost of folly" who now haunts only Lamia's dreams. For Lycius Lamia is his prize mare "pacing" him to triumph, carrying him "foremost in the envious race" (1.217). Of course Lycius has it wrong: he is the prize that connects Lamia to Apollonius, the prize that Apollonius wants back. Lamia herself apparently did not calculate sufficiently the power of the previous owner of her talisman, for in fact Lycius provides her no 23. Disingenuousness links the Freudian superego to Jean-Paul Sartre's notion of mau vaise foi, bad faith. And compare Hermes' relation to the nymph to Sartre's presentation of the "Actaeon complex": "the idea of discovery, of revelation, includes an idea of appro priative enjoyment. What is seen is possessed; to see is to deflower. . . . Every investigation implies the idea of a nudity which one brings out into the open by clearing away the obstacles which cover it, just as Actaeon clears away the branches so that he can hav? a better view of Diana at her bath," Being and Nothingness, trans.

Her magic is her only defense, a magic Lycius must cooperate with, "par ticipate in, " in order to remain effective. In a phrase, Lycius must remain inside the house, as Lamia knows she must, in order to maintain their magical defenses. The uninvited thought that buzzes into Lycius's head will thrust her out of the house?"you have dismiss'd me; and I go / From your breast houseless: ay, it must be so" (11.44-45)?as will be reenacted in earnest when the self-proclaimed "uninvited guest" Apol lonius appears at the wedding feast to reclaim his possession (11.165).24 So Lamia foretells her own doom; she has seen it before. Apollonius "look'd and look'd again" because this is not the first time he has uttered this curse: Then Lamia breath'd death breath; the sophist's eye, Like a sharp spear, went through her utterly, Keen, cruel, perceant, stinging: she, as well As her weak hand could any meaning tell, Motion'd him to be silent; vainly so, He look'd and look'd again a level?No! "A Serpent!" (11.299-305) Repetition is the principle of identity.25 Lamia and Apollonius are drawn together by the repetition and reciprocation of their daemonic and Hermetic attributes. For instance, when the reincarnated Lamia is set forth as "of sciential brain / To unperplex bliss from its neighbour pain" (1.191-92), her skill at unbinding is of a piece with Apollonius' notorious Newtonian ability to "Unweave a rainbow" (11.237). Garrett Stewart works through more of these details: "Lamia may have a de monic origin, but, in another inversion, the 'demon eyes' (11.289) now belong by accusation to Apollonius. One sign of the original serpent's 24. Discussing The Eve of St. Agnes in Keats and Embarrassment (Oxford: Clarendon, 1974), Christopher Ricks cites the following from John T. MacCurdy, "The Biological Significance of Blushing and Shame," on the dangers of public indulgence among primitive peoples: "It excites jealousy. Hence to make love or to eat in public is to invite rivals to seize that which is being enjoyed" (p. 132). For other examples of Lycius' disregarding of taboos, see Coleman O. Parsons, "Primitive Sense in Lamia" in Folklore 88:2 (1977), pp. 203-10. 25. OED: "Some have thought that ident-(i) was taken from the L. adv. identidem 'over and over again, repeatedly.'"

In what seems like a reverse demonic metamor phosis at the end of the poem, the 'lashless eyelids' (11.288) have become a feature of Apollonius" (p. 33). Here Keats underscores the gender distinction between the two in a way that humanizes Lamia while ser pentizing Apollonius: she has a woman's eyes while his are reptilian, or at least, bald like the tonsured head of a celibate priest. In addition, Apollonius is marked by the serpentine in the manner of his blighting of Lamia. He is a basilisk: Its name comes from the Greek and means "little king"; to the Elder Pliny (vin,33) it was a serpent bearing a bright spot in the shape of a crown on its head. . . . What remains constant about the Basilisk is the deadly effect of its stare and its venom. . . . The Basilisk dwelled in the desert; or, more accurately, it made the desert. Birds fell dead at its feet and the earth's fruits blackened and rotted; the water of the streams where it quenched its thirst remained poisoned for centuries. That its mere glance split rocks and burned grass has been attested by Pliny.26 Apollonius partakes of the fabulous ferocity of the Basilisk, a mythical serpent, a male Medusa, in x-raying and evaporating the presence of his mythical counterpart the Lamia. Lamia's serpent form was all along a mark placed on her by Apollonius, a mark rendered decipherable only at the very end of the poem when Apollonius unleashes his "demon eyes" and thus reveals his daemonic and serpentine identity as well. He is the usurping agent transforming the wedding scene; he was also the usurper of her prior life. In other words, the conclusion of Lamia is also its unstated prologue. The Hermes episode is a "screen prologue"; by adding it to the basic story handed down from Philostratus and Burton, Keats stealthily displaces the "unhappily ever after" of Lamia's conclu sion back "upon a time, before" the Hermes episode. Compare the Basilisk to Nietzsche on the "venomous eye" (Genealogy 1.11.476) of resentment: The slave revolt in morality begins when ressentiment itself becomes creative and gives birth to values: the ressentiment of natures that are denied the true reaction, that of deeds, and compensate themselves with an imaginary revenge. While every noble morality develops 26.

This inversion of the value-positing eye?this need to direct one's view outward instead of back to oneself?is of the essence of ressentiment, (i. 10.472?73) So Apollonius' concluding banishment of Lamia is not only a piece of obsessive repetition and the reenactment of a prior scenario of repres sion; it is also a proclamation that his own identity is founded on the reaction and affect of spite. Apollonius is a "little Apollo, " a bringer not of light but of blight. And pressing some allegories further, Apollonius is the anti-Dionysus, the patriarchal superego, the ascetic idealist whose gaze derives its withering potency from the negativity of his sublima tions, that is, from his drawing up of eros from the phallus to the eye, "like a sharp spear . . . keen, cruel, perceant, stinging."27 In this poem Apollonius is not so much a sophist as he is a shaman, a black magician of negativity, the destructive sublimator transforming erotic desire into defensive aggression.28 Thus Lamia comes forth as the sublimated, the displaced, the victimized Python that the harshly Apollonian psyche casts forth from its consciousness of itself. As her anthropomorphosis out of the serpentine state indicates, Lam ia's story is an earnest parody of the fabulous monsters of the Apoca lypse. The colorings of Lamia's metamorphosis appear to derive from the book of Revelation: The colours all inflam'd throughout her train, She writh'd about, convuls'd with scarlet pain: . . . And, as the lava ravishes the mead, Spoilt all her silver mail, and golden brede; Made gloom of all her frecklings, streaks and bars, Eclips'd her crescents, and lick'd up her stars. . . . (1.153-60) When abominated by the resentful patriarch Apollonius, her figure echoes the great Mother "clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars" (Revelation 12:1), hounded into the wilderness by "a great red dragon, with seven heads and ten horns, and seven diadems upon his heads.

The woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and bedecked with gold and jewels and pearls, holding in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the impurities of her fornication; and on her fore head was written a name of mystery: 'Babylon the great, mother of harlots and of earth's abominations'" (17:3-5). Apollonius shares with John of Patmos the resentful and venomous eye of this Revelation. V Terms of Penance At the beginning of the poem's climax, as Apollonius bends his stare toward Lamia, at the same moment when Lycius unaccountably brings forth Lamia's name, he puts to her a question that her silence answers in the affirmative: " 'Lamia, what means this? Wherefore dost thou start? / Know'st thou that man?' Poor Lamia answer'd not" (11.254-55). Apol lonius needed only to see Lamia's "royal porch" to conclude, "'twas just as he foresaw" (11.155,162) She had of course previously implored Lycius not to invite Apollonius?"from him keep me hid" (11.101). And when the lovers had first arrived in Corinth, Lamia's trembling and coy in quiries concerning the identity of Apollonius were suspiciously nuanced: "tell me who / Is that old man? I cannot bring to mind / His features" (1.371-73), as though she ought to have known his name, and as though she were disingenuously testing Lycius's present loyalties. The d?j? vu she shares with Apollonius is surely ironic: manifestly it claims for Lamia a prior residence in Corinth; but implicitly it asserts that she knows Apollonius from some previous connection. The poem's climax, the light shed on Lamia by the blight from Apollonius' "demon eyes," redefines the narrator's first attempt to identify Lamia: She seem'd, at once, some penanced lady elf, Some demon's mistress, or the demon's self. (1.55-56) Having sketched out the numerous qualities that relate demon to mistress, let us concentrate on "some penanced lady elf." The OED explains that originally "elf" was masculine, "elven" feminine. Although in the 13 th and 14th centuries the two seem to have been used indiffer ently of both sexes, in modern use "elf" chiefly, though not always, denotes a "male fairy." Keats's "lady elf" indicates his sensitivity to the masculine implication of "elf"; but the phrase couples two nouns and effectively the two genders together, as Stewart has noticed of the following line as well: "the confusion of gender between 'demon's mis</page><page sequence="21">ANTHROPOMORPHOSIS IN KEATS'S LAMIA 575 tress' and 'demon's self is also of a piece with the discordant compre hension the snake evokes" (p. 12). What about "penanced"? The term "penance" is ecclesiastical: it signifies the imposition by a spiritual au thority upon a sinner of a period of reparatory repentance. Granting Lamia a prior life makes sense of "penanced": her original metamor phosis is the result of a complex penance. For instance, prime modes of penance are self-concealment, a hiding of the self for shame, and banishment. "Penanced" suggests and contains the notion of "penned," enclosed or closed in, and Lamia's penance consists precisely of her exile to Crete and enclosure in an uncanny body. Concerning "penance" the OED offers these examples: 1653 H.Cogan tr. Pinto's Trav. vii 21 He shut himself up for fourteen days, by way of penance, in a Pagod of an Idol. 1656 COWLEY Pindar Odes Notes (1666)9 The opinion . . . that souls past still from one body to another, till by length of time and many penances, they had purged away their imperfections. This last entry allows us to grasp the metamorphic principle in the act of penance. Insofar as the detachable soul is penitent beyond its connec tion with the fallen body, or more prosaically, insofar as shamed desires persist beyond their repression while undergoing severe qualitative transformations, penance will be a motive for metamorphosis, the cast ing out and transforming of the soul.29 Metamorphosis under the sign of "penance," then, characteristically involves a prior judgment and a thanatoptic moment?a movement of divorce and alienation between the body as the scene of sin and the soul as sinful agent. Penances ritually acknowledge this death and divorce by penning the repentant self anew in a confining space and burying it away, resulting in entombments such as Lamia's. Further, one suffers penance when and if one repents, and it is curious to discover that in biology and zoology the adjective "repent"?pro nounced REpent?denotes "creeping," the reptilian locomotion, as well as the gait of the repentant before the gaze of the judgmental. Lamia repents by becoming repent?she repeats regret by creeping. Her rep 29- L?on Wurmser, The Mask of Shame (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins U. Press, 1981), passim: "Shame's aim is disappearance. This may be, most simply, in the form of hiding; most radically, in the form of dissolution (suicide): most mythically, in the form of a change into another shape, an animal or a stone; most archaically in the form of freezing into complete paralysis and stupor; most frequently, in the form of forgetting parts of one's life and one's self; and at its most differentiated, in the form of changing one's character," p. 84.</page><page sequence="22">576 BRUCE CLARKE tilian form concretizes her shame and self-abasement and signifies an implicit, perpetual apology to the spiritual authority who first authorized her penance. From this perspective, the presence of "penned" within "penanced" can be punned by "penned" meaning "written." Playing on an author's authority to authorize his characters, Keats "pens" his cre ation; but more importantly, the enforcement of her penance has un penned or "written off" her prior mode of being, X'd out her "woman's shape." Finally, if pen-is short for "penis," then "penanced" contains a strong suggestion of the male genitalia, echoed all along by Lamia's snake form. "Penanced lady," then, anticipates the bisexual configuration of "lady elf, " and the entire series of phrases linguistically enacts the enclosing or concealing of feminine within masculine terms: "penanced(m) lady(f) elf(m)," "demon's(m) mistress(f) . . . self(m)." Adding all this up, "penanced" = (i) imposed upon to perform repentance (2) enclosed? concealed, shamed (3) written (off), repressed (4) penised. "Some pen anced lady elf" would thus convey "a repent (creeping, reptilian) meta morphosis (repression or outcasting) of a penitent, penised lady male fairy." A stealthy Hermes and a jealous Aphrodite are brought together to engender a "penanced lady elf," a hermaphrodite then cast out by a spiritual authority. The complex apologia represented by Lamia's suf ferings would bespeak the fate of a feminine soul in a masculine body, or of any psyche inscribed or penned in an inappropriate form through the mortifications of a patriarchal conscience. Lamia is ultimately the story of the creation and the catastrophe of Apollonius' conscience. It is a parable of the apocalypse attending not the omega but the alpha of conscience, the institution of the patriarchal prerogative. Relations between Apollonius and Lamia cluster around the gender indeterminateness of the phallic stage and the terrors of the castration complex. The penised lady is the phallic mother on whom the fantastic catastrophe of castration descends, the potentiated female at the center of pre-oedipal fantasies and post-Freudian speculations.30 The phallic mother is perhaps the most monstrous of all the fabulous monsters in the Freudian bestiary, yet is she any more abominable than the Whore of Babylon? Lamia is an outcast that must hide itself for shame in doomed magical spaces, the fantastic figure of matriarchal power shamed and cast out by the revelation of its visible lack. Is the 30.

Will Lamia ever have her own being, independent of the fantasies and prohibitions of some other agent? The dilemma and as yet unresolved penance of the feminine within a patriarchal culture is to be inescapably contaminated with male fantasies and prohibitions. "I was a woman once" means "I was once unsubmitted to patriarchal mortifications." That Keats could imagine for Lamia no ultimate escape from Apollonius' tyranny dram atizes the tempered bewilderment of a poet who knew he needed to make his peace with the spirit of the fathers but could foresee only death as the outcome of that peace. VI Affective Capabilities In Keats and Embarrassment Christopher Ricks discusses Keats's entrance even into the embarrassments of others: "the blush . . . could sum up so much of what was rightly felt about spontaneity and the extent to which the deepest feelings are somehow involuntary and yet are our responsibility" (p. 53). Ricks shows how Keats's empathy is roused by blushing situations, where shyness, self-consciousness, modesty, or shame exhibit themselves scenically?redden the cheeks?despite the blusher's attempts to conceal or counteract that effect. Ricks links such situations to Keats's speculations on identity and "Negative Capability, that is[,] when man is capable of being in uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact &amp; reason":31 Keats thought "that the healthy strength of a sense of identity depends para doxically upon the risk and openness and not upon self-protection; depends upon risking the absence of identity" (p. 25). Like Hermes leaving his throne empty, but without divine prerogative, the poet puts identity into abeyance in order to be transferred into the lives of others, risking the self-exposure that entails, not to usurp or absorb but to participate in the identities of others: "As to the poetical Character itself ... it is not itself?it has no self?it is every thing and nothing. ... A poet . . . has no Identity?he is continually in for?and filling some other Body. . . . But even now I am perhaps not speaking from myself: but from some character in whose soul I now live" (Rollins, 1, 386-88). 31.

H. Reynolds, 3 May 1818: this letter also contains Keats's lyric "Mother Of Hermes! and still youthful Maia."</page><page sequence="24">578 BRUCE CLARKE Ricks discusses another letter of Keats's evoking "how a woman's sexual self-possession and freedom from embarrassment created in him a corresponding self-possession and freedom" (p. 46). But how can the absence or relinquishing of identity lead to self-possession? Sometimes Keats's lust for identification produces overtones of morbidity, as in "Ode to a Nightingale," where at the extremities of participation an urge to dispossess the self completely is felt: "Now more than ever seems it rich to die." At other times, however, as in Keats's visit with Jane Cox, his own generosity is matched by the other's, in this case the implicit generosity of a self-possessed woman, a woman closer to Bab ylon than to Patmos: She is not a Cleopatra; but she is at least a Charmian. She has a rich eastern look; she has fine eyes and fine manners. When she comes into a room she makes an impression the same as the Beauty of a Leopardess. She is too fine and too conscious of her Self to repulse any Man who may address her?from habit she thinks that nothing particular [i.e., flirtatious]. I always find myself more at ease with such a woman; the picture before me always gives me a life and animation which I cannot possibly feel with anything infer iour?I am at such times too much occupied in admiring to be awkward or on a tremble. I forget myself entirely because I live in her. (Rollins, 1, 395) Anthropomorphic empathy in Keats takes many shapes: Jane Cox, the urn and the nightingale, Apollo and Lamia. But throughout his art and his speculations the formulaic structures and motives of metaphor and metamorphosis remain constant, perhaps the one constant identi fying Keats as the great "camelion Poet" (Rollins, 1, 387), a locution by which Keats signs his trade with an image of Lamia, a blushing or metamorphic serpent. How does the question of gender figure in these dynamics? Lamia ends in an impasse because Lamia can achieve no self subsistent being: her unending tragedy is Lycius' as well, to remain the creature of Apollonius, their identities dissolved in his negativity.
