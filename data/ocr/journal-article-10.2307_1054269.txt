<plain_text><page sequence="1">VOLUME XV The SOUTHERN ECONOMIC JOURNAL July I948 THE PROBLEM OF ORDER IN ECONOMIC AFFAIRS* JOSEPH J. SPENGLER Duke University The art of progress is to preserve order amid change, and to preserve change amid order.... Order is not sufficient .... What is required, is . . order entering upon novelty; so that the massiveness of order does not degenerate into mere repetition; and so that the novelty is always reflected upon a background of system. A. N. Whitehead, Process and Reality The problem of economic order is taking on the importance it had in classic Rome about the time Augustus substituted the principate for the republic, and in Western Europe during the period of religious strife when Bodin and others were searching for a means of unifying the community. In this paper I deal with the problem of economic order and with economists' and others' treatment of it at various epochs in man's ideological history. In the first section I discuss analytically a principal source of error in economic theory, of which the treat- ment of the problem of economic order is later shown to be a prime example. In Section II, I define the problem of economic order. In Sections III, IV, and V, I summarize the treatment of this problem by representative ancient, medi- eval, and modern writers. In Section VI, I examine some of the consequences of Smith's views' having been followed to the exclusion of relevant views of the Physiocrats. In Section VII, I consider the implications of the preceding analy- sis for the contemporary American economy. I Man, as represented by the social theorist, inhabits two realms of being, a realm that is real and a realm that is analytical or hypothetical. The realm that is real comprehends the earthy, dissonant, bumbled, and seemingly confused (albeit not wholly disorderly) world of affairs of which an all-perceiving, all- understanding, and hypothesis-free observer from another planet would be sensible. The realm that is hypothetical consists of the mental constructs more or less wittingly built by the social theorist (and, for that matter, though less wittingly, by every human observer) out of his percepts and concepts of the real realm, with the object in view of mirroring the significant components of the real realm and attaining understanding of and (possibly) control over this realm. The hypothetical realm, moreover, although sharply distinguishable * Presidential address delivered before the Southern Economic Association, November 7, 1947. 1 NUMBER I</page><page sequence="2">JOSEPH J. SPENGLER from the real realm, is an integral part of the latter, inasmuch as man's behavior through time is conditioned by his percepts, concepts, and hypotheses of the elements composing the aggregate environment impinging upon him. The hypothetical, abstract realm of being generated by social theorists con- stitutes a part of their society's ideology, itself an important component of this society's spiritual equipment, which, together with its substantial equipment, determines the well-being of the individuals composing the society. The hypo- thetical realm of being may be distinguished into its irrational and its rational components, and the latter may be divided, in turn, into that which appears to consist with the real realm of being and that which does not. Progress in social theory and (in considerable degree) in man's ability to shape his spiritual and physical environment consists in the supersession of irrational by rational mental constructs, and in the replacement of mental constructs which do not consist with the real realm of being by those which do. At different times in man's ideological history his hypothetical realm of being has been variously divided into subrealms by social scientists. Moreover, with the differentiation of social science and social scientists, particular hypothetical subrealms of being have fallen under the dominion of particular groups of social scientists who have been implicitly charged, somewhat after the manner of priesthoods in ancient Egypt, to make their respective hypothetical subrealms of being adequately represent the corresponding and referent real subrealms of being. The subdivision of the hypothetical realm of being, coupled with the manner of parcelling out of the custody of these hypothetical subrealms, has not been un- mixed blessing. This arrangement has been in accord with the time-tested principle of specialization; but it has not always been accompanied by adequate coordination. In consequence, certain hypothetical subrealms have been neglected while others have been given undue attention and have been allowed to masquerade as both themselves and cognate hypothetical subrealms. Such disproportionality in attention would be of no material concern to man were it not for the fact that the hypothetical realm is, as has been noted, an integral part of the real realm of being; that the hypothetical subrealms of being are interdependent; and that consequently the substantial welfare of man is sensitive to overemphasis of some hypothetical subrealms of being at the expense of undervaluation of others. The subject matter of economics constitutes one of these hypothetical sub- realms of being, respecting whose boundaries, however, economists have differed. Exponents of operational definition have been content to say that economics is what economics does. Others have accepted Robbins's definition of economics as "the science which studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses."l Still others have agreed with Fraser that connecting economics with the idea of wealth need not be inconsistent 1 L. Robbins, An Essay on the Nature &amp; Significance of Economic Science, 2d ed., London, 1935, p. 16. 2</page><page sequence="3">PROBLEM OF ORDER IN ECONOMIC AFFAIRS with centering it about the concept of scarcity.2 For our purposes Parsons' description is more satisfactory: that economics is a science of action, concerned with the ramifications of economic rationality "in its various relations to the concrete facts of action," and to be distinguished both from politics (which has to do with coercive rationality, power relations, and social order) and from soci- ology (which treats of the "integration of individuals with reference to a common value system, manifested in the legitimacy of institutional norms, in the common ultimate ends of action, in ritual and in various modes of expression").3 It is the adequacy of the aggregate content of the definitions of the various hypothetical subrealms of being that is important rather than the specific con- tent of the definition of any particular subrealm. For example, it does not make too much difference how we circumscribe the hypothetical subrealm assigned to economics provided that: (a) this subrealm accurately represents its correspond- ing real subrealm of being; (b) other hypothetical subrealms are so defined that in the aggregate they adequately represent those portions of the real realm of being not represented by economics; and (c) economists are fully aware that, just as in the real realm of being, economic, political, sociological, and other elements are more or less interdependent, so in the hypothetical realm of being the analytical elements corresponding to these real elements are more or less interdependent. If condition (c) is not met, and at the hypothetical level reliance is placed in the capacity of the economic subrealm per se to reflect com- prehensively all significant objects and events relevant to the real economic sub- realm of being, an adequate representation and explanation of the latter will not be forthcoming. Moreover, even though condition (a) is observed, condi- tion (c) cannot be met unless condition (b) is satisfied. Our present incapacity to deal with the problem of economic order arises in large measure from the compounded failure of economists (1) to devise a hypo- thetical subrealm that adequately represents economic objects and events in the real subrealm of being, and (2) to take fully into account at the hypothetical level the interdependence of the economic subrealm with other relevant sub- realms. In particular, economists have failed sufficiently to recognize that what takes place in the real subrealm of being they are studying is conditioned by the prevailing state of power relations and by the extent to which conduct influencing common values and value attitudes have been integrated.4 In the historical 2 L.

For when many persons coexist in the same physical space, their ultimate values cannot be random and multiple; they "must be, to a significant degree, integrated into a system common" to the members of the com- 3</page><page sequence="4">JOSEPH J. SPENGLER sections that follow it will be shown how this neglect of the roles of common values and the distribution of power originated. II Three somewhat incompatible conditions have combined, at all times and in all economies, to create the problem of economic order: the autonomy of many consuming and factor-organizing and supplying agents; the necessity that these autonomous agents behave in an appropriately cooperative and coordinate fashion; and the generally felt need that economic activity be continuous and uninterrupted. The problem has been aggravated, moreover, by the force of secular and random change which is continually playing upon these three con- ditions as well as upon other aspects of man's real realm of being, and which has been the principal source of the recorded improvement in man's material lot. Economic activity issues ultimately out of the pressure men are under to transform more or less undifferentiated factors of production into goods and services. Economic activity therefore entails autonomy at two levels, at that of the consumer-agent and at that of the agent who combines and organizes factors of production, or conditions their supply. Decisions regarding what and how much is utilized for ultimate consumption are made chiefly by individual consumers, by familial units, by eleemosynary institutions, and by governmental units. Accordingly, since each decision maker enjoys a greater or lesser degree of autonomy, it is not possible for any one to gauge at any moment the full significance of the aggregate of consumer decisions being made. Decisions re- garding what and how much is to be produced, and by what methods, are made by private and public entrepreneurs (i.e., proprietorships, partnerships, corpora- tions, and other plural enterprises) in the light both of their surmises and ap- praisals respecting actual and prospective decisions at the consumer level and of other supposedly relevant circumstances. Again, since each of these decision makers enjoys a greater or lesser measure of autonomy, it is impossible for any one to predict at any moment just what the aggregate of producer decisions then being made signifies. Decisions regarding the provision of factors and materials of production are also made by autonomous agencies, the supply of labor being under the dominion of the individual worker and/or a trade union5 (bent upon both perpetuating itself and maximizing the remuneration of its members),6 and munity; and in fact they "are developed in the processes of social interaction." See Parsons's analysis of Durkheim's views, ibid., pp. 400-401. It is interesting to note that Leibniz accounted for the harmony of minds by supposing them under one moral govern- ment. See H. W. Carr, Leibniz, London, 1929, pp. 131-32, 133-34. 5 It may also be under the control of others with power over individual workers (e.g., slave owners). 6 On some of the factors which influence corporate decisions, see R. A. Gordon, Business Leadership in the Large Corporation. On factors which influence trade-union decisions see A. M. Ross, "Trade Unions as Wage-Fixing Institutions," American Economic Review, XXXVII, 1947, pp. 566-88; J.

In the absence of cooperation-producing co6rdinating arrangements, autonomy, at the consumer, supplier, and producer levels must generate unpredictability, conduce to economic disorder, and, in conjunction with the continual stimulus of change, make for frequent interruption of the circular economic flow. In theory these coordinating arrangements may assume a number of forms. But these forms are not equally satisfactory; whereas some secure the cooperation of the discretionary agents without interfering unduly with their autonomy, others operate, actually or in effect, to destroy the autonomy of the agents whose economic behavior they are supposed to coordinate. Thus co6rdination may be accomplished by centering in the state the determination of what is to be pro- duced, how it is to be produced, and to whom it is to be distributed; yet this arrangement, except when it is executed under the guidance of a flexible price system, strips the theretofore autonomous agents of their independence. Again cooperation may be secured by imbedding in the underlying value system an appropriate set of tastes and a preference for appropriate productive methods; but this arrangement, while it does not actually destroy the autonomy of the agents whose activities are being coordinated, in effect solves the problem of order by terminating its existence. Yet again, co6peration may be secured by allowing the several agents their respective autonomy while requiring them to conform their behavior to certain rules calculated to coordinate their activities; this method circumscribes autonomy and co6peration without destroying either, thereby making possible their reconciliation. If it be granted that a large measure of autonomy is desirable, it follows that cooperation may best be secured through (i) a considerable and appropriate integration of underlying values; (ii) the establishment and enforcement by the state of norms and rules suited to produce coordination without destroying autonomy; and (iii) action by the state to prevent any appreciable interruption of the continuity of the ag- gregate flow of goods and services. I shall not attempt to define economic order and its requisites with precision; for its meaning and content have undergone modification pari passu with changes in man's environment, in his conduct-determining ends and norms, and in the means he has at hand to make his environment subserve his ends. In general, it may be said that the problem of economic order is solved in proportion as the three objectives, autonomy, co6peration, and continuity, are achieved and recon- ciled both with one another and with the force of secular and random change. Present-day economists will probably agree that, given a distribution of income both realizable and generally acquiesced in, economic order exists in proportion as: (a) disguised unemployment is absent; (b) technological and related progress is at a rate consistent with the maximization of the annual increment of output per capita; (c) productive processes are not subject to interruption by political strife, by conflict over the division of output, or by cyclical depressants remov- able, or mitigatable, consistently with (b) and (d); and (d) conditions (a), (b), and (c) are compatible with relevant elements in the prevailing common value system. Condition (d) is introduced to allow for value elements whose full or 5</page><page sequence="6">JOSEPH J. SPENGLER adequate realization is, or was, inconsistent with the full realization of conditions (a), (b), and (c). For example, it is necessary to allow for the fact that economic activity has, or may have, value for the actor both as means and as end-both the game itself and its favorable outcome may yield satisfaction to the player; and it is essential to remember that when slave or feudal relationships were dominant, full realization of conditions (a) and (b) was not practicable. III Before I consider the treatment of the problem of economic order by Europeans who wrote prior to Quesnay and Smith,7 I should like to pose the problem in purely abstract terms. So let us imagine an economy composed of individuals who are without conduct-regulating institutions and free of the coercive influence of an external coordinating agent. If these individuals are animated by ap- propriate automatic behavior mechanisms, or are under the governance of ap- propriate conduct-determining norms, they will carry on the interdependent activities of the economy harmoniously and co6peratively. If, although neither of these conditions holds, a powerful external agent is present to co6rdinate these activities, like cooperation and harmony will result. In each of these three situations, our supposed human world is completely atomized; yet the activities of these autonomous atoms are coSrdinated and harmonized, respec- tively, by internal automatisms, by norms, and by a coercive agent. In the absence of each of the stipulated co6peration-producing conditions, there would be disharmony and disorder. The real realm of being, of course, does not correspond to any one of these hypothetical realms; for in the real world the behavior of individuals, while more or less autonomous in character, is subject to the unobtrusive and/or overt regulatory influence of the institutions, associations, laws, folkways, mores, and other habit-patterning arrangements operative in the community. These regu- latory influences are designed and help to produce harmony within circum- scribed segments of the real realm of being. These influences also can and do contribute to the solution of the larger problem, the harmonizing of the diverse economic ends and activities of the more or less autonomous individuals and groups composing the economy. At different times in history men have em- 7 Limitations of time and space prevent our discussing the manner in which the problem of economic order was solved and the good of the individual was harmonized with that of his fellows and that of the community by other cultures and their social scientists. As- pects of the problem as it has been dealt with in primitive cultures are treated in M. J. Herskovits's The Economic Life of Primitive Peoples. On the Chinese solutions see Chen Huan-Chang, The Economic Principles of Confucius and His School. F. C. S. Northrop's analysis (The Meeting of East and West, chap. 10, esp. pp. 352-354, 383-393) suggests that the Oriental emphasis upon the indeterminate and undifferentiated aesthetic continuum entails an approach to the problem of order different from that prevalent in the West. Because of limitations of time and space I have limited my discussion to the views of the leading representatives of different schools and/or epochs. There were differences between members of given schools (e.g., between Plato, Aristotle, and Xenophon); but these have been ignored. 6</page><page sequence="7">PROBLEM OF ORDER IN ECONOMIC AFFAIRS ployed various methods to establish compatibility among the economic ends and activities of individuals and the commonwealth; and economists have fashioned theories respecting the achievement of economic harmony. While these theories have always reflected the premises underlying the regnant complex of philosophi- cal ideas, they usually consisted, in the works of the pre-Smithian writers, of differently weighed combinations of coercive principles, ethical norms, and religious sanctions. The problem of economic order and its solution was dealt with at length by the Socratic philosophers. I shall confine myself to Aristotle, however, since his treatment of the problem, while somewhat unique, is representative of the approach of the Socratic school. Man, as conceived by Aristotle, is a form of matter whose potentiality and excellence can be fully actualized only in the city-state, or polis, which, being the "highest" form of "community," aims "at the highest good." Within it, presumably, was to be found that harmony with which so many of the classical writers were concerned. From Aristotle's discussion of the constitution of Athens and other politico-economic subjects, it is evident that, for him, disorder had its origin in the unrestricted striving of man after the necessarily limited means of wealth and power, while order could be achieved through the appropriate adjustment of man's strivings to the means available for their satisfaction. This adjustment was most likely to be found when there was private property, but accompanied by generosity; when men sought to gratify modest bodily pleasures through "household management" rather than to satisfy a desire for limitless gain by acquiring money through unnecessary kinds of exchange; and when the state was one in which citizenship was duly restricted, the rich balanced the poor, the middle class was supreme, and the government was one of laws rather than one of men.8 Aristotle's con- tribution to the analysis of the problem of order thus consisted in his supposition that individual and household autonomy can best conduce to the development of man's faculties in a middle-class-dominated state where the other classes are in balance and where properly enacted laws are sovereign. Because he did not grasp the possible role of competition or conceive of a self-adjusting economy Aristotle did not effectively apply ethical norms and coercive power to the sustentation of such a self-adjusting process.9 Aristotle's polis could not withstand the impact of the military prowess of his See Aristotle, Politics, I-IV, VI-VII; Rhetoric, I, 4; Ethica Nichomachea, I, 5; IV, 1-2, V, VII, 9; Oeconomica; and Atheniensumn Respublica.

Collingwood, The Idea of Nature, Oxford, 1945, Part I; W. Jaeger, Paideia, I, chap. 9, esp. pp. 164-165, also 266-267, 277. Stressing the importance of the rule of law even more than did Plato, Aristotle said (Politics, III, 16): "He who bids the law rule may be deemed to bid God and Reason alone rule, but he who bids man rule adds an element of the beast; for desire is a wild beast, and passion perverts the minds of rulers even when they are the best of men. The law is reason unaffected by desire." In the Rhetoric (I, 4) he says that "it is on a country's laws that its welfare depends." 9 "A man ought to know," says Aristotle, which of the useful parts of wealth getting "pay better than others, and which pay best in particular places."

SPENGLER most famous student, or the bellicosity of the Greeks and the defectiveness of their economic institutions.'0 Nor could the essentially Hobbesian theory of the Epicureans.11 In the hands of the Roman writers, particularly Cicero, the community-like polis becomes the much more association-like res publica, founded upon a sharp distinction between res privata and res publica and "on a basis of agreed rights and common interests," yet designed through the use of adequate social controls to develop man's potentialities and secure justice. Law is the cement which holds economy and res publica together, whilst preserving freedom and a proper measure of autonomy. The state is "an association of citizens united by law."12 In a much greater degree than Aristotle, therefore, Cicero grasped the function of impersonal laws and rules; but he did not recognize their peculiar fitness as instruments, if properly contrived, to produce economic order. Ideological and material change gradually dissolved the Roman mode of life and the classical culture on which it rested until, in the fifth century, they were finally replaced by barbarism and the Christian culture. Two Stoic philoso- phers, Cicero (106-43 B.C.) when he declared all men to be equal in light of the providential law of nature, and Seneca (d. 65 A.D.) when he described (as did St. Paul and as did Malthus centuries later) government and property as in- stitutions necessary to curb the wickedness of man, undermined the classical belief in the individual-perfecting role of the state and in the supreme value of citizenship in such state.l3 Subsequently, Ambrose (c. 340-397) envisaged man's institutions as means to moderate fallen man's passionate desires.'4 St. Augustine (354-430), reasoning somewhat as did Hobbes later, observed that conflict and oppression rose "so long ... as the object of appetition is insufficient for any or for all," and that the competition of men for wealth and power pro- duced disorder. Happiness is to be found in the appropriate ordering of the hierarchy of beings and of values, and in the subordination of inferior ends to the ultimate value of eternal salvation. Order could not be permanently established in a secular state, however, even through use of force. Felicity and concord must be sought in Christian brotherhood and discipline under the leadership of the episcopate.15 Augustine, therefore, conceived neither of a self-adjusting economic system nor of a state either totalitarian or perfection producing. But he condemned buying "cheap to sell dear," indicating, as had Roman lawyers, that there is a just (albeit not invariant) price to which buyer and seller, under the impelling influence of moral principle, should conform.i6 10 H.

Thus, St. Thomas Aquinas, their most outstanding spokesman, unlike Augustine, looked upon the state as an association divinely instituted to impel "towards the common good of the many, over and above that which impels toward the private good of each individual"; to make possible "virtuous living" through establishment of peace, guidance to good deeds, and provision of a sufficiency of "the things required for proper living"; and to enable men "through virtuous living to attain to the possession of God."17 But Thomas, like Augustine, restricted the role of the state, subordinating it to man's needs, and emphasized the ultimate regulative influence of the moral principles to which the Church sought to induce man to conform. While Thomas conceived of economic society as a kind of organism whose specialized parts are interdependent, and while he looked upon economic order and liberty as complementary, he did not find in competition a means of securing economic order while preserving economic liberty. Cooperation was to be sought rather through the coordinating and regulatory operations of essenti- ally autonomous lesser associations, or gilds, whose activities were to be coordi- nated in turn (presumably) by the principles of commutative and distributive justice which individuals and groups were morally bound to observe. Only when necessary was co6peration to be achieved through the intervention of the hierarchically supreme "commonwealth which is ordained to procure by itself a sufficiency of goods for human life." In just price, therefore, to the formal and the practical definition of which they contributed greatly, Thomas and his school found the principal guide to economic order;18 and, under the pressure of ethical and religious and related sanctions, it did exercise considerable influence.19 With the sundering of medieval ideological unity by the Renaissance and the Reformation, man's theorizing about his behavior tendencies underwent great modification, and the problem of economic order was reformulated. To this development various changes contributed: the supersession of medieval society and pre-capitalist town economy by bourgeois society and nascent capitalism; the rise of religious particularism; the ascendancy of the national state, together with the diminution in the regulatory influence of moral principle and communal precept; and the growth of Gesellschaft-like at the expense of Gemeinschaft-like organizational elements. Political and ethical theory began to emphasize that 17 Thomas Aquinas, On the Governance of Rulers (translated by B. G.

The new formulation implicit in these ideological tendencies was not forthcoming, how- ever, until the midseventeenth century when Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679) greatly elaborated the view, suggested already by Machiavelli, that a society of essentially egoistic individuals must be held together ultimately by the fear of force.20 Hobbes treated the problem of economic order in a manner befitting a century notable for its creative work in mathematics, mechanics, and physics; for its rejection of anthropomorphism, moralism, and hierarchism; and for its espousal of the objective view that man is a physical automaton.21 The problem arises in Hobbes's world of human atoms from the fact that men are animated by ap- petites and aversions which are without limit whereas that which exists to satisfy these appetites and aversions is restricted in actual and potential amount. For man "felicity is a continuall progresse of the desire, from one object to another"; and life is an unending struggle after power which consists in"his present means, to obtain some future apparent Good." Moreover, since men differ in constitu- tion and taste from bees and ants, they do not automatically live sociably to- gether as do these creatures. Quite the contrary. Out of desire for gain, safety, glory, and reputation men necessarily quarrel, and this tendency is strengthened by the fact that in the state of nature men differ little in ability and expectation. Consequently, so long as "men live without a common Power to keep them all in awe, they are in that condition which is called Warre; and such a warre, as is of every man against every man." Under these conditions industry, agriculture, commerce, security, capital formation, and collective activity are impossible; the "Laws of Nature" are not well observed; and man's life is "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short." But a way of escape is open. In fact man is obli- gated to choose this way by the "fundamental law of nature," which commands him to seek peace and avert the destruction of his life. Escape consists in the establishment by men, under mutual covenant, of an absolute personal sovereign (embodying "the Essence of the Common-Wealth"), or "Common Power, to keep them in awe, and to direct their actions to the Common Benefit." Only in this wise can harmony be maintained. Although Hobbes did not sequester the economic from other realms of being, his basic contribution may nonethless be said to consist in his explicit recognition of the dependence of the functioning of an essentially free-enterprise economy upon the existence of a sovereign agent competent to establish appropriate rules and capable of enforcing their observance. While Hobbes indicated that the right of property in goods is limited, that the formation of contracts is subject to regulation, that monopolies are hurtful, etc., he did not indicate in detail what 20 In his Six livres de la republique (1576) J. Bodin also anticipated Hobbes in part. How- ever, while Bodin sought to formulate the bases of peace, order, and unity within the bounds of the modern state, his concern was primarily to solve the problems originating in feudal particularism and diversity of religion, and his solution involved greater restriction than did Hobbes's upon the power of the individual sovereign. 21 See P. A. Sorokin, Contemporary Sociological Theories, chap. 1, esp. pp. 4 ff. 10</page><page sequence="11">PROBLEM OF ORDER IN ECONOMIC AFFAIRS economic rules are needed, or how a sovereign should proceed to formulate them. He was content to urge the criterion of "common benefit." For his knowledge of economic affairs and of the functioning of economic systems was limited; and his grasp of the growing role of autonomy was inadequate. Notwithstanding, he demonstrated, as no economist was to demonstrate for more than 250 years, the very great importance of the element of coercion in the determination of the sequence of economic events.22 We have spanned two milleniums, moving from the elementary Greek com- munity-state through the complex Roman state and the simpler medieval economy into the burgeoning mercantilist state. In no instance have we found an economically harmonious real realm of being, or writers with a thorough grasp of the operations of an economic system. But we have found recognition of sources of economic disharmony, and descriptions, however inadequate as to detail, of means by which economic harmony may be achieved. The means un- covered are the small community-like state, commonly accepted ethical and legal norms, religious sanctions, and an unrestricted coercive agent. Of these means and the need to employ them economists were soon, however, to lose sight. IV A number of circumstances contributed to the formulation of the belief that the harmony-producing agencies I have described-state, common ethical norms, religious sanctions-were not really necessary. The Mercantilists criticized the older ethico-religious appraisals of usury, luxury, etc., and, as a rule, objected to the conduct of business enterprise by the state as such. Al- though some of them believed the state to be essentially incapable of fixing prices at a "just" or any other level,23 many conceived in large nature "of the economic system as a mechanism which could be manipulated,"24 and of man as an egoist animatable and directable through his desire for gain. Whence they supposed that the state, by the use of rewards and penalties, could in some degree canalize the endeavors of undertakers.25 It began to appear that, if this eco- nomic mechanism could be shown to work automatically and in a fashion to 22 See T.

SPENGLER harmonize the interest of individuals, there would not be much need for a regula- tive and coercive agency. To this denouement several elements in the pre- Smithian stream of thought were contributing. From the rationalist thought of the Middle Ages philosophy had received a sense of coherence and order which affected the shaping of subsequent thought.26 The mercantilist assertion of an identity between national and class interests, together with the supposition of some students of juristic natural law that a reasonable harmony of interests tended to be realized, must have contributed to the development of the later view that individual and general interests, if not naturally identical, were recon- cilable either through a fusion of interest or through an artificial identification of interest.27 The actual operation of the economy was illuminated, at a time when the entrepreneur was demonstrating his key role, by Cantillon's descrip- tion of the organizing and uncertainty-assuming roles of the entrepreneur and of his response to effective demand (principally that of the landed proprietors).28 Still additional elements out of which a more or less self-adjusting and harmony- producing mechanical economic system could be constructed were supplied by Hume and others.29 Locke and Hume contributed appreciably to the rejection of Hobbes's central thesis, Locke proceeding from a different view of human nature, and Hume from a H.

(i) There is a "fusion of interests" when "personal and general interest" are spontaneously identified "within each individual conscience by means of the feeling of sympathy" which interests the individual in the happiness of his neighbor. (ii) A natural identity of interests may be supposed to exist; for, since the human species lives and survives despite the predominance of egoistic motives in human nature, "it must be admitted that the various egoisms harmonise of their own accord and automatically bring about the good of the species," and it may be inferred that egoistic motives are essen- tial to survival. (iii) There is an artificial identification of interests if, it being denied that egoisms do or ever will harmonize, it is necessary to suppose it to be the business of the legislator, by means of punishments and rewards, to identify the interest of the individual with the general interest, since this is in the interest of the individual. 28 R.

This insecurity has its origin in the limitedness of resources and man's inability to work them effectively in a lawless world. Solution is found in the compacting of men to establish a government. But this government differs from that of Hobbes; it is distinct from the society of which it is the instrument, and its sovereignty lies in the community as a whole, to which it is subordinate. The "chief end" of this government is the "preservation of... property." This end is accomplished through the establishment of "settled, known" and commonly accepted law, together with a judiciary to interpret it and a coercive power to enforce it. More specifically, the purpose of government is to preserve the fruits of that labor by which men are enabled to escape want and economic insecurity; for property con- sists essentially in these fruits, since "of the products of the earth useful to the life of man" ninety to ninety-nine hundredths "are the effects of labor." Ac- cordingly, Locke's argument suggests, something like economic order can prevail only where there is law and a government that is democratic in spirit, and where consequently, the worker receives the imputed product of his labor.31 Pre- sumably, where such order does prevail, pronounced economic inequality does not tend to develop. Hume, in his discussion of the problem of economic order, considered the various ways in which private and general interests might be reconciled, but he failed adequately to synthesize these ways. The problem of economic order issues, he believed, out of man's nature and the limitedness of resources. There would be no problem if things were to be had for the asking; or if men were ani- mated solely by benevolence; or if, there being extreme want of all necessities, men, from motives "of necessity and self-preservation," were to establish an egalitarian collectivism. Actually, however, enjoyments are limited, although augmentable in supply by human effort, and men act from self-love, albeit tempered somewhat by benevolence, fellow-feeling, and a disposition to be en- gaged by "a tendency to public good, and to the promoting of peace, harmony, and order in society." There is need, therefore, for the institution of property, to preserve an equitable balance between wants and the means of satisfying them. This institution cannot stand by itself, however, Hume's analysis dis- closes; for he declared that "property should be regulated by general inflexible rules" and that "authority," while subject to the control of law, is "essential" to the existence of its antithesis, "liberty," which "is the perfection of civil so- ciety." Hume thus dwelt upon both autonomy and co6peration and noted the complementary aspects of their roles. Notwithstanding, in his able exposition 30 For other criticisms see H. Sidgwick, Outlines of the History of Ethics, London, 1939, pp. 174 ff., 184 ff., 200. Cumberland, a precursor of the later utilitarians, assigned con- siderable weight to benevolence as a determiner of conduct; Shaftsbury reasoned that normally there is much harmony between a man's social affections and his "reflective self- regard." 31 John Locke, Of Civil Government, 1690, Everyman edition, pp. 118-121, 126-141, 158- 165, 180-181, 189-190, 205, 224. 13</page><page sequence="14">JOSEPH J. SPENGLER of the self-regulating specie-distributing mechanism, and in his anticipations of a self-regulating competitivism, he failed to note explicitly the importance of the overhanging presence of a coercive factor, perhaps because he took it for granted.32 The closing third of the eighteenth century witnessed the formation of two dissimilar, yet not wholly unlike, systems of economic thought, that of Quesnay and that of Adam Smith, of which the latter, being more in concord with the prevailing climate of opinion, eventually triumphed and gave to economic theory a bias it was to retain for more than a century. In the somewhat doctrinaire writings of Quesnay and his competent disciples three theses, of import for the present discussion, are to be found: (a) that a contingently self-adjusting competitive system can conciliate diverse economic interests and produce justice; (b) that the continuance of economic activity at a high level presupposes sufficient and appropriately distributed expenditure; and (c) that objectives (a) and (b) are realizable so long as men observe, or are made to observe, the knowable laws and rules expressing that "essential and general" natural order which "comprehends the constitutive and fundamental laws of all societies." Where there is competition and complete freedom of exchange, declared Le Trosne, "natural price" (or "bon prix," the homologue of the scholas- tics' "just price") results, the interest of everyone is subserved, the interest of no one is hurt, and the interests of all individu?ls are equilibrated in such wise as to preserve the social order.33 It is competition which conciliates all interests: it is perfect only under the absolute reign of freedom of trade, which is the premier consequence of the right of property, and in consequence one of the most essential laws of the social order. It alone can establish products at their natural price, so that they feel only the variations of the physical order, which it also renders very much less perceptible.34 Competition serves also to increase the probability that economic activity will continue at a high level. For persistence of prosperity is dependent upon con- tinuity of expenditure, and the flow of a sufficient fraction thereof into agricul- ture and other industries yielding a "net product"; and these circumstances are favored by competition. In their emphasis upon the necessity of continuity of expenditure, and in their denial that it results automatically, the Physiocrats both anticipated certain of the views of Lord Keynes and stimulated Say and 32 David Hume, Essays Moral, Political, and Literary, edited by T. H. Green and T. H. Grosse, I, pp. 113-117, 156 ff., 330 ff., 443-460, II, pp. 179-217, 271-274. Both Plato and Cicero had anticipated Hobbes, Hume noted (ibid., pp. 184-185n.).

These ends were achieved only when men and the community acted in consistence with the natural order and its inviolable natural laws. Then only were liberty, property, and security, together with harmony and prosperity, ensured; then only, in our terms, could autonomy be reconciled with coordination and continuity, consistently with change. The basic laws of the natural order were knowable. The Physiocrats, therefore, proposed to secure economic order in two ways. Through education knowledge of the necessary laws and rules would be diffused and, in our terms, underlying values would be more completely integrated. Provision was made for the use of coercion when necessary and compatible with the basic natural order. The prince, or legal despot, would declare positive laws which expressed the laws of the natural order and which were calculated to maximize the welfare of the population. The formulation of such positive laws could not, however, be entrusted solely to the prince and his legislative aides; they might err, in which event the state would be weakened and the welfare of the people would be ad- versely affected. The Physiocrats, therefore, advocated the creation of a su- preme magistracy, or judiciary, consisting of judges adept in the laws and principles composing the fundamental natural order. It would be the duty of these judges to void all positive laws which failed to conform to the natural order and thus deny them enforcement. While it is true that the Physiocrats gave concrete content only to a small number of positive principles, all of which have since been found more or less wanting, they clearly posed the problem of economic order and noted the basic importance of both the coercive factor and values integration.36 Throughout the nineteenth century and for a time thereafter three presump- tions pervaded the hypothetical realm of being fashioned by orthodox econo- mists: (a) that the economic system is an automatically self-adjusting mecha- nism; (b) that the economic role of the state should be narrowly restricted; (c) and that, given conditions (a) and (b), the interests of individuals are harmonized with each other and with the general interest about as well as may be expected. These propositions had their origin in the writings of Adam Smith.37 35 These views of the Physiocrats are recounted in my "The Physiocrats and Say's Law of Markets," Journal of Political Economy, LIII, 1945, pp. 193 ff., 317 ff.

Beer there was much of Aquinas and scholasticism in the views of the Physiocrats, most of whom presumably were Catholic in religion (An Inquiry into Physiocracy, London, 1939). 37 For a brief account of the introduction of Smith's views into Europe and their wide- spread influence see M. Palyi's essay in Adam Smith, 1776-1926. 15</page><page sequence="16">JOSEPH J. SPENGLER Competition, together with the disposition of men speedily to spend their money receipts, made the economic system self-adjusting, Smith inferred. For competition, through its influence upon prices, directed men where to work, what to produce, and how much to supply. Man's disposition to expend his receipts with alacrity, which later was reformulated as Say's Law,38 served to prevent protracted unemployment. The self-adjusting economic system would therefore maximize wealth and per capita income, distribute it fairly equitably, and ensure a satisfactory level of employment. Because Smith believed that, in the absence of restraint, the economic system tended to operate automatically, and that governments were less competent than individuals to deal with matters of private economy, he assigned to "the obvious and simple system of natural liberty [which] establishes itself of its own accord" all duties but those of defense, administration of justice, and maintenance of useful and desirable public works whose effectuation the profit motive cannot bring about. Actually, Smith's definition of what the state could do was quite elastic, and his list of specific tasks which the state should perform was rather long;39 yet because these tasks were not all assembled in one place, and because his emphasis usually was upon the superior competence of the "system of natural liberty," Smith left the impression of circumscribing the role of government even more than he in fact proposed. It is this somewhat misleading impression which set the tone for subsequent writers. Even so Smith's account suggests that "with some important qualifications, . . the interests of society, by which he understood the interests of the sum of individuals in the group, would be best served by permitting each one to pursue his own interests in his own way."40 Smith did not assert the existence of a natural identity of private and public interest, even though he is sometimes credited with having done so.41 He was 38 On Smith's anticipation of Say's law, see my paper cited in note 35 above. 39 See J. Viner, "Laissez Faire," in work cited in note 37, esp. pp. 138-153. Smith's views on the role of government are found principally in Book V of The Wealth of Nations. He dealt with it also in his lectures as of 1763 (Lectures on Justice, Police, Revenue and Arms, edited by E. Cannan, London, 1896). On the formation of Smith's views see also W. R. Scott, Adam Smith as Student and Professor, Glasgow, 1937, chap. 5. and pp. 111-115. 40 This is H. J. Bitterman's conclusion in his careful "Adam Smith's Empiricism and the Law of Nature" (Journal of Political Economy, XLVIII, 1940, pp. 487-88; see also 488 if., 703 ff.) in which Smith's empiricism is demonstrated. See notes 41, 43 below. That al- lowing great autonomy to the individual and the individual business man would make for the interests of all must have been suggested to Smith by Mandeville's Fable of the Bees (E. Cannan, introduction to Wealth of Nations, p. liv of Modern Library edition). That Smith was influenced in this and other respects by Boisguilbert is the conclusion of H. V. Roberts (Boisguilbert, chaps. 15-17). On Scottish opinion on this matter see G. Bryson, Man and Society. '4 See Haldvy, op. cit., pp. 89-92, 97, 101-107, 212-213, 237. In his Theory of Moral Sen- timents, which was speculative in character, Smith wrote as if the order of nature is har- monious, under divine guidance, and conducive to man's welfare. In the Wealth of Nations, which was empirical in character, Smith had to take disharmonies into account. The dif- ferences are well summarized by Viner ("Laissez Faire," pp. 125-127). Bitterman con- cludes that "Smith's theory of ethics did not rest directly on the doctrine of the order of nature" (op. cit., p. 717). 16</page><page sequence="17">PROBLEM OF ORDER IN ECONOMIC AFFAIRS aware of too much evidence to the contrary. Notwithstanding, he supposed that man's propensities (in especial, self-interest, sympathy, and the tendency to truck and barter) were such as to bind men together in a politico-economic com- munity and to make for a harmony rather than for a disharmony of egoisms.42 In fact, so long as competition remained free, a high degree of harmony tended to result. Although Smith implied that disharmony had its origin principally in monopolistic and other exploitation of buyers and in monoposonistic and other exploitation of sellers, he did not advocate positive governmental intervention to enforce competition. He apparently supposed that if the government did not support monopolistic arrangements, they would not be very effective; and that if it espoused a program of positive action, it probably would not know what to do and therefore would accomplish more harm than good. Accordingly, his analysis suggests, the most that the government could do respecting the enforcement of competition was to refrain from establishing or supporting anticompetitive arrangements. If this policy were pursued, reasonable harmony would result; and, if the history of Europe and the prospects of America constituted an augury, this harmony would increase.43 Without an organized school, a body of doctrine is not likely to be widely dis- seminated. For Smith's views this school was initially provided in England by the Benthamite Utilitarians and on the continent by those who subscribed to the analogous "juristic and spiritualistic philosophy of the Rights of Man."44 Bentham went beyond Smith, rejecting even the latter's defence of the fixation of maximum interest by the state and of governmental interference in interna- tional trade when necessary to national defense. For in a world such as the British, Bentham held, economic liberty consisted with the springs of human action and the interests of men were approaching natural identity. Men were potentially equal. The nation was moving towards economic equality, and this progress would be accelerated by education, savings institutions, and estate- decomposing death taxes. The eighteenth century realm of equality, which was based upon individual property, and in which the interest of each naturally 42 F. H. Giddings transmuted Smith's "sympathy" or "fellow-feeling" into "conscious- ness of kind" and made it "the principal cause of social conduct." See preface to 3rd edi- tion of Giddings's Principles of Sociology. A. W. Small (Adam Smith and Modern Soci- ology) impressed by Smith's historical and institutional analysis, found the object of modern sociology implicit in Smith's moral philosophy. 43 This paragraph is based upon my reading of Smith's two chief works. According to Taylor (op. cit., p. 208) late eighteenth and early nineteenth century economic liberalism "was not a doctrine that selfish interests should be given free play while the state and society remained passive. It was a particular theory of an ideal legal order, imposing equal restraints upon all in order to give equal and maximum liberty to all, so that a 'natural' interplay and adjustment of interests might ensure the welfare of all." Bitterman's (see op. cit.) interpretation is somewhat at variance with Taylor's. Smith's interest in the wel- fare of the common man is brought out in E. Ginzberg's House of Adam Smith. 44 Cp. Halevy, op. cit., p. xvi. F. A. Hayek points out that the Liberalism of the French Revolution was not yet founded upon an understanding of the free market.

SPENGLER concurred with that of all, was nearly at hand,45 and with it the solution of the problem of economic order. Until the early part of the present century British orthodox economists con- tinued to believe the economic system to be essentially self-contained and self- regulating, and the most salutary govermnental policy to be one of minimal state interference. Respecting wages, for example, it was supposed that nothing could be accomplished by trade union activity until Jenkin, Edgeworth, and others showed that in an imperfectly competitive labor market collective action might influence the outcome.46 Both the classical and the neoclassical economists were keenly aware of the dis- harmony of the interests of individuals. Yet they believed that harmony was most likely to be maximized, given security of private property, free competi- tion, and minimal state action; and they failed to advocate state intervention either for the purpose of enforcing competition or for that of maintaining pur- chasing power. The propensities of men would be appropriately channelized and their interests harmonized as much as possible, Malthus implied, in an economic system founded upon private property and the family, each guarded by the state and supplemented by education in individual responsibility.47 Wage and other contracts, Ricardo declared, "should be left to the fair and free competition of the market, and should never be controlled by the interference of the legislature."48 Both the Manchester School, with laissez faire as its maxim, and the followers of Herbert Spencer, who declared the "wisest plan" to be "to let things take their own course."49 deemed competitivism adequate if allowed full play. So also believed Walter Bagehot.50 J. S. Mill observed that the distribution of wealth "is a matter of institutions solely" while that of pro- duce is subject in part to custom; he was critical of the society about him, and 45 For a careful summary of Bentham's views see W.

Yet he considered "every restriction of [competition] ... an evil, and every extension of it... always an ultimate good"; he predicted that the principle of private property would long survive; he in- sisted on the supreme importance of liberty; and he narrowly circumscribed the functions of government, although not so much so as had Smith.51 Jevons acted on a presumption against state interference, qualified, however, by its subordina- tion to the Benthamite principle of the greatest happiness of the greatest number; but although he favored state control of some economic relationships and public utilities and state management of others, he placed his trust mainly in free com- petition.52 Sidgwick presented a qualified defense of the "system of natural liberty," saying that "the general presumption... is not in favour of leaving industry altogether to private enterprise ...; but is on the contrary in favour of supplementing and controlling such enterprise in various ways by the collective action of the community."53 Alfred Marshall, most influential British economist in 1890-1920, while admitting the need for state control of public utilities, and while alert to the deviation of the position of "maximum satisfaction" from that of stable competitive equilibrium, greatly preferred smaller scale private enter- prise. But Marshall's reason for this conclusion, while akin to Mill's reason for defending individual liberty, sets him apart from his utility-dominated forebears. An economy, Marshall believed, was not merely a mechanism to provide utilities; it was also, if it consisted primarily of smaller scale enterprise, a social arrange- ment that tended to bring out the best in men.54 The belief in minimal state interference, self-regulating competitivism, and the consequent realization of essential harmony held sway also outside England. In France J. B. Say, having praised the separation of economics from politics, gave expression to an economic liberalism that found state intervention ob- jectionable even when necessary and that assumed laissez faire to produce a high degree of harmony between individual and public interest.55 This liberalism received its most optimistic expression at the hands of the vulgariser Bastiat who appropriately named his work Harmonies economiques.5 These doctrines, except for occasional protectionist and populationist modifications and a reduc- 51 Principles of Political Economy (W.

The ease with which economic questions can be formulated when pure competition is assumed commended this assumption to later economists as well. 52 The State in Relation to Labour, London, 1882; Methods of Reform, London, 1883. 53 H.

It was criti- cized by those who supposed the state, as did Adam Miiller and some Romantics, to be essential to the development of the individual; by the Utopian socialists and the Godwinian anarchists, who denied the need even of a co6rdinating competitive system, since, given an appropriate world, men rationally and spontaneously co6perate; and by those who believed the followers of Smith were underestimating the effects of social change. It was criticized by the historical economists who denied that competition could produce interpersonal concord any more than it could produce international concord; and who concerned themselves, as did later institutionalists, with (among other matters) the contribution of ideals, institutions, and the state to the coordination of the economic activities of individuals; but who contributed relatively little to the solution of the problem of economic order, since they lacked a unifying theory to guide them in the as- sembly and organization of facts. It was criticized by those evolutionists who found in the economic realm the same purposeless struggle they believed they had discovered in the animal realm. It was criticized by those who believed that, because of the uneven distribu- tion of bargaining power issuing out of the class structure, many members of society received less than they had produced in terms of the marginal principle, or were denied the opportunity to move into employments where productivity and remuneration were relatively high. Even Boehm-Bawerk and Von Wieser admitted his discrepancy between the harmonious hypothetical equilibrium that would result under conditions of pure competition and the actual "equilibrium" that is found in the real realm of being.61 57 Typical though not identical in emphasis are the works of De Molinari, Colson, Leroy- Beaulieu, and Courcelle-Seneuil. Even advocates of protectionism in France and America otherwise accepted the tenets of liberal economics. 68 E.g., the works of H. Carey, A. L. Perry, F. A. Walker, J. B. Clark, and F. M. Taylor. 59 E.g., see accounts of various national schools in Palgrave's Dictionary of Political Economy. 60 Walras, first formulator of the theory of general equilibrium, "was the first economist to show that under perfect competition, full employment of resources is compatible with the desire of each individual to maximize the return from his resources."

Both Saint-Simon and Comte, founders of modern authoritarian socialism, rejected liberty and sought an economy essentially totalitarian in character and subject to centralized direction through the medium of the banking system.62 Marx and his followers described the existing capitalistic economy as shot through with disharmony and the exploitation of class by class; and they predicted its eventual supersession by a planned, propertyless, and competition- less economic order.63 Although students of the business cycle were not usually concerned with the problem of economic order in general, they were concerned with the continuity of a high level of economic activity, and they therefore contributed, as did Marx, to the rejection of one of the props of the belief in automatic self-adjustment and economic harmony, namely, Say's Law. This law was taken to mean in effect that general overproduction, general involuntary unemployment, and the de- struction of purchasing power are impossible. The rejection of this prop pre- pared the way for Keynesian and related forms of anticyclical state interven- tionism.64 Of the contributions of the critics of Smithian harmony economics, the two most relevant to the present discussion are those of Commons and Pareto. Commons added collective action to the body of subject matter with which economists must concern themselves. Building upon Hume, he developed in detail how economic scarcity gives rise to both conflicts of interest and mutual cooperation. Conflicts of interests center in the transactions of individuals and other bargaining units with one another. In the absence of appropriate restrictions these conflicts would generate continuing anarchy and disorder which increasing efficiency in the use of resources would be powerless to correct.

SPENGLER is out of the question, individual transactions must be subjected to collective control which is designed to produce order. This collective control issues out of persuasion, coercion, and duress; it consists in the working rules of collective action; and it manifests itself in the various rationing arrangements by which access to resources is peacefully and lawfully restricted to the limited amounts available.65 Pareto was largely responsible for the destruction of the utilitarianism with which economics was intimately associated in the nineteenth and early twentieth century, and for the recognition that the findings of economic theory, if they are to make possible solutions of concrete problems, must be synthesized with those of other relevant social sciences.66 Pareto denied both the utilitarian premise that the ends of human action are random, and the counter-proposition that the interests of men are naturally identical. He noted that wealth and power are the principal means to ends, and that economic activities can be effectively car- ried on only where "a relatively stable settlement of the power relationships between individuals and groups is attained." Accordingly, it is essential to the realization and maintenance of a social equilibrium conducive to stability in economic relationships that "the value element in the form both of ultimate ends and of value attitudes is in a significant degree common to the members of the society." (When such social integration is lacking it may sometimes be es- tablished through the use of force by an elite newly risen to power.)67 Pareto's inference was made even more explicit by Durkheim who showed that the sanc- tions and the sense of moral obligation, which cause men to conform to the com- mon system of normative rules by which order and social equilibrium are sus- tained and the centrifugal forces in society are contained, rest finally upon "a common system of ultimate-value attitudes."68 Economic order is not attain- able, the argument implies, so long as this common system is lacking. VI I have said that the social theorist gets into trouble when he fashions a sub- realm of hypothetical being to represent a corresponding subrealm of real being, and then supposes that analysis of this hypothetical subrealm, to the exclusion of all other relevant hypothetical subrealms, can adequately explain the objects and events constituting the corresponding real subrealm or provide solutions for 65 J.

For since the subrealms of real being are interdependent, the use of a hypothetical subrealm to discover ex- planations and solutions pertinent to the real realm of being must take this inter- dependence into account. I also stated that solution of the problem of economic order consists in recon- ciling economic autonomy, coordination, and continuity with each other and with the forces of productivity-increasing change. I said, furthermore, that economists had failed to solve this problem because they had relied upon analysis of a circumscribed hypothetical economic subrealm to explain objects and events in a more extended real subrealm. Specifically, economists have ignored the fact that the real economic, political, and moral subrealms of being are inter- twined; and they have acted as if the conduct of affairs in the real economic sub- realm of being is essentially independent of what takes place in the real political and the real moral subrealms. Let us see how this situation came about. It had been recognized long before Adam Smith and Quesnay wrote that the interests of men are not naturally identical but must be harmonized either through coercion, or through commonly held ethical and/or religious beliefs and norms which govern conduct and cause men to cooperate, or through a combination of coercion and norms. The relative weights attached to these two co6rdinating agents by social scientists had varied: in Greco-Roman times the state was deemed of greater importance; in the early centuries of Christianity ethico-religious norms dominated; by the late Middle Ages the role of state had become greater than in the period of Augustine, and it continued to grow in importance until the eighteenth century. At this time, however, both Smith and Quesnay made the great discovery that, even in the absence of a preconceived design, the conscious action of many men in an econ- omy produces results which, though undesigned, are orderly, essentially con- sistent with their separate interests, and (usually) superior to those which an individual or group might achieve through deliberate planning of the activities of a whole economy.69 Smith and his followers thus established the extreme im- portance of economic autonomy, particularly that of the entrepreneur who must function in a dynamic world. The case for economic autonomy was made even stronger by subsequent economists. It was strengthened by the finding of Walras and his followers that free competition tends to maximize effective utility.70 It has been strength- 69 See F. A. Hayek, "Scientism and the Study of Society," Economica, IX, 1942, pp. 288- 291, XI, 1944, pp. 27-30. 70 See note 60 above. The Lausanne school for reasons of mathematical convenience postulated a finely articulated economic system. Elsewhere ("The Role of the State in Shaping Things Economic," Journal of Economic History, Supplement VII, 1947) I have suggested that the economic system, being shot through with play, is not so tightly articu- lated as is sometimes supposed. Professor C. L. Allen has recalled to my attention T. Veblen's observation that "the system has not yet reached a fatal degree of close-knit interdependence, balance, and complication; it will run along at a very tolerable efficiency in the face of a very appreciable amount of persistent derangement" (The Engineers and the Price System, p. 57). Here Veblen refers primarily to level of activity; my reference is to the sensitivity of one part of the system to a change in some other part independently of 23</page><page sequence="24">JOSEPH J. SPENGLER ened on administrative grounds so far by the inability of proponents of cen- tralized planning, despite their refutation of the thesis of Von Mises and others that correct pricing is theoretically impossible in a socialist state, to demonstrate how correct prices can be established in practice under authoritarian socialisms.71 It was strengthened also by the extra-economic arguments of Mill and Marshall to the effect that man can develop his inherent excellences only under a system that allows great liberty to the individual.72 Unfortunately Smith and his followers, because of their emphasis upon the value of autonomy, made a mistake which the Physiocrats did not make: they overlooked the fact that, in the absence of appropriate rules and of a coercive agent to enforce these rules if necessary, the actions of autonomous agents will not be so coordinated as to produce harmony; and they ignored the fact that economic activity can continue at a high level only if satisfactory conditions are present. If the followers of Smith had recognized the contingent character of the harmony and the continuity which, they supposed, tended automatically to be realized, they would have sought to discover what these necessary conditions are; and they would have formulated rules and principles out of which statesmen, armed with practical wisdom, could fashion institutional and governmental controls suited to establish these conditions and reconcile autonomy with co- ordination and continuity in a dynamic world. Had this been done, much bad legislation and many costly failures to take collective action would have been avoided. The cost to the Western world of its failure to combine Quesnay's principles with those of Smith has been accentuated by three changes, the last two of which are attributable in part to the decision of economists to follow Smith to the ex- clusion of Quesnay. First, because of the decline in the conduct-determining influence of the Christian ethic, the underlying common value system has lost some of its homogeneity and, therefore, some of its capacity to coordinate the economic behavior of autonomous agents; whence, as Pareto observed, the need for a harmony-producing coercive agent has increased. Second, the four pillars -the balance-of-power system, the international gold standard, the liberal state, and the self-regulating market-of nineteenth century civilization and Smithian harmony finally collapsed.73 Third, the supposedly egoistic individual bargain- ing units of the early nineteenth century have been largely replaced by plural bargaining units-trade unions, corporations, etc.-whose psychology, objec- tives, and methods of procedure differ markedly from those of the bargaining egoisms postulated by nineteenth century economic theory.74 Whence the the level of activity. The condition of sensitivity, of course, is far more important than that of insensitivity. 71 For a discussion of the problem and reference to some of the relevant literature see my review of Hayek's The Road to Serfdom in Southern Economic Journal, XII, 1945, pp. 48-55. 72 The psychologist I.

Polanyi in The Great Transformation. 74 See references cited in note 6 above. 24</page><page sequence="25">PROBLEM OF ORDER IN ECONOMIC AFFAIRS determinate economy of yesterday in which the forces of competition supposedly produced something like a satisfactory equilibrium is giving way to an indeter- minate economy in which essentially amoral economic interest groups will struggle for power and income until, if this struggle is not otherwise composed, a Hobbesian sovereign takes over.75 A foretaste of what may be in prospect was supplied in the post-V-J-Day period by the struggle of business, agriculture, and labor, always abetted by opportunistic politicians, each to rid itself prematurely of the wartime controls imposed on it in the interest of the common welfare. This Hobbesian denouement is by no means a foregone conclusion; and we could not confidently predict this outcome even if it were assured in fact. We have at our disposal knowledge which may be mobilized to reconcile autonomy, co6rdination, continuity, and change. Keyensianism may yet enable us to ensure the continuity which belief in Say's Law was unable to produce. The allocational principles developed by the Austrian, Lausanne, and related schools may yet be fashioned into economic rules suitable for the guidance of agents, coercive and otherwise, appointed to suppress anticompetitive behavior and bring about a correct allocation of the factors of production.76 The studies of Pareto, Commons, and others, which have made explicit the co6rdinating role of coercive agents, institutions, and common value-attitudes, may help us to implement the information they have provided. VII I turn now to the import of what I have said for the American economy. This economy, as presently conceived and operated, does not appear likely to persist. For it has failed to solve the problem of economic order; and an econ- omy that fails to solve this problem does not tend to survive unchanged. It has provided a large amount of economic autonomy, to be sure. But it has been un- able to ensure continuity of a high level of economic activity, and its capacity to coordinate and harmonize the diverse interests of individuals and groups has been declining and probably will continue to decline so long as present conditions persist. Today powerful groups-I refer particularly to those elements in the business, agricultural, and labor sectors which are seeking to establish quasi- monopolistic prices for their goods and services-are engaged in a struggle for 75 "The Keynesian revolution in theory ... may turn out to be the opening stage of a greater revolution, precipitating us into the theory and practice of an indeterminate econ- omy of organized groups, whose social roots go far deeper, and whose social effects are far wider, than questions of wages and prices." See J. M. Clark, "Some Current Cleavages Among Economists," American Economic Review, Supplement, XXXVII, 1947, p. 2. See also my paper cited in note 70 above. It is significant that six of the ten principal causes of inflation listed in the Monthly Business Review (Oct. 1947, p. 4) of the Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank are the result of action by politicians; the other four causes are attributable in part to actions of politicians. 76 Some of these principles have been expressed formally by A. P. Lerner in his The Economics of Control. Since Lerner's statement of some principles is unsatisfactory at the formal level, and since he does not show how the formally satisfactory principles may be translated into administratively feasible rules, his study, while useful and clarifying, is of quite limited applicability.

SPENGLER wealth and power, which the coercive power of the state is at present unable to compose, and which is affecting adversely the well-being of a large fraction of the population. This struggle is aggravated by the fact that in the cases of agri- culture and labor the two primary forms of power, the economic and the politi- cal, are united as they have never before been united in this country. There is great danger, therefore, that this struggle, if permitted to continue, will generate a totalitarian economic state and thus destroy the very autonomy that most thinking men would like to see preserved. Struggles of this sort may in theory be composed in one of two ways, either of which can produce a co6rdination of activities and an artificial identity of in- terests. A centrally planned economy, dominated and largely operated by the state, may be brought into existence. This solution is out of the question, how- ever. It involves rejection of the very values and ideals to the realization of which the attainment of economic order is merely a means. It entails denial of the autonomy we are seeking to preserve. It almost certainly will neither maxi- mize the rate of growth of per capita income nor bring about the particular kind of co6rdination that most men want. For the entrepreneurial state lacks and probably will continue to lack the know-how, the moral integrity, the inventive- ness, the capacity to give incentive, and the flexibility of economic behavior requisite in a dynamic world. Moreover, because of the uncertainty inherent in human society and characteristic of human endeavor, the state is incapable of establishing for large numbers those complex arrangements which are presently brought about in the democratic world by continual mutual adjustments of the participating autonomous agents.77 A solution may be found, secondly, in the establishment and enforcement by the state and by inferior associations, of a body of rules,78 suited to produce a workable and stable harmony of diverse interests, while probably allowing to individuals and entrepreneurs even more autonomy than they now enjoy in the aggregate. These rules would be designed: (a) to produce an economically cor- rect allocation of factors of production and thus remove short-run and long-run disguised unemployment; (b) to prevent major disturbances in the monetary system and in the orderly growth of the media of exchange. These rules, by reducing diminishable uncertainties and narrowing the range of expectations, would give greater stability and certitude to the expectations of men regarding future prices, the character of prospective institutional controls, and the probable scope of the use of coercion in the economic realm of being. The general effect of these rules would be to prevent monopolistic and related practices and to compel buyers and sellers, whether many or few in number, to 77 See K. Polanyi, "The Growth of Thought in Society," Economica, VIII, 1941, pp 428- 457. See my papers cited in notes 70 and 71 above. 78 "The substance of society, in so far as it is free or moral, is the body of such rules made by human beings for their own association, with a view either to making their activity itself as interesting and satisfying as possible, or else to fulfilling what they conceive to be their 'task' as human beings." See F. H. Knight, "Economic Science in Recent Discussion," American Economic Review, XXIV, 1934, p. 237. This view was effectively stated by the late Henry Simons. See references to his work in my paper cited in note 70 above. 26</page><page sequence="27">PROBLEM OF ORDER IN ECONOMIC AFFAIRS behave as if they were operating under conditions of pure competition.79 Given these rules, collective bargaining between employers and trade union representa- tives could no longer serve, as it so frequently does today, particularly in the case of industry-wide agreements, to establish supra-competitive wages and prices at the expense of the rest of the community; organized agriculture could no longer, through government-sponsored arrangements, collect from American consumers both supra-competitive prices for agricultural products and tax receipts for distribution to farmers participating in these monopolistic opera- tions;80 particular sheltered business groups could no longer overcharge their customers; periodic raids upon the federal treasury by groups such as the "sil- ver interests" would become a thing of the past; and banks would no longer be so free to manufacture or to destroy means of exchange irrespective of the effects of such action upon the economy. In short, effective application of appropriate rules would restore to the consumer, the Forgotten Man of the American econ- omy, his seat at the bargaining table which was taken away from him by the monopoly-seekers and their political henchmen. The establishment and enforcement of these rules will not only serve to pro- duce competition, or its similitude, and an acceptable artificial and dynamic identity of interests. It will also help to make possible what so far has been achieved only in regimented police states dedicated to war or to preparation for war, namely, economic continuity. Something like continuous high-level ac- tivity can be achieved only if the state and other associations make use, when necessary, of the instruments of control which contemporary economic theory has fashioned or may fashion. These instruments cannot safely be applied, however, in a dynamic society under the sway of monopoly-seekers and shot through with the bottlenecks to which full employment gives rise even when free competition prevails. For in such a society the use of these instruments makes for the prevention of necessary price adjustments, the perpetuation of monopolistic arrangements, and the generation of inflation; it cannot, therefore, bring about real continuity in such a society. The establishment of rules, even when supported by the coercive power of the 79 In this section I use the terms monopoly and competition, and their adjectival forms, in a not too rigorous sense. The term monopoly is intended to cover all economically ad- verse deviations from pure competition except those no more extreme than monopolistic competition when selling is aggressive. The use of the concept competitive equilibrium is not intended to suggest that this particular equilibrium necessarily yields the maximum of satisfaction; it is here used as a first approximation on grounds of convenience. It is not possible in this paper to take into account the ways in which a purely competitive equilib- rium may differ from an equilibrium yielding maximum satisfaction. It is the latter which is the desideratum and which, in so far as practicable, the rules should be contrived to realize. See note 54 above. 80 Evidence that schemes such as the tobacco allotment plan elevate prices above the competitive level is suggested by a study of the price of tobacco land which reveals that "a majority of farms in the tobacco areas that were sold in 1945 and which had appropriate tobacco allotments were enhanced in market value by from $300 to $600 for each allotment acre." See J. E. Mason, "Acreage Allotments and Land Prices," The Journal of Land &amp; Public Utility Economics, XXII, 1946, p. 181. On the basic problem which agriculture controls are intended to solve see T. E. Schultz, Agriculture in an Unstable Economy. 27</page><page sequence="28">JOSEPH J. SPENGLER state, will not suffice per se to secure and preserve economic order. First, the basic common value-attitudes of the population must be sufficiently consistent with these rules to mobilize in their support a strong sense of moral obligation to comply with these rules. Otherwise there will be need for a much stronger ex- ternal coercive agent than is likely to be compatible with a high degree of autonomy. What I have said respecting rules and autonomy is well illustrated and at- tested in particular branches of athletics such as football. Everyone with any interest in football-coaches, players, spectators-is concerned above all that the game both survive and improve. Everyone is willing, therefore, even at the expense of temporary disadvantage to himself, to accept and abide by what- ever rules are essential to the survival and improvement of the game. So the rules are enforced both by appointed regulatory bodies armed with sanctions and by the commonly felt sense of moral responsibility for the maintenance and observance of an appropriate body of rules. While these rules circumscribe the behavior of each team, they do not deprive it of its creative autonomy. Each coach plans his offense and defense within the boundary of these rules, incorporat- ing his offensive and defensive plans in a set of plays, maneuvers, and action- directing maxims. This set allows considerable autonomy to the individual player just as the overriding body of rules allows considerable autonomy to each coach and team. A coach does not imagine and describe and plan in detail every possible disposition, and series of dispositions, of men by which his team may be confronted, or with which his team may face the opposing team. It is impossible in practice for a coach to do this, let alone to communicate to his players every possible disposition and counterdisposition of his men and their opponents. If this were attempted the game would be frozen. The coach is content, therefore, to plan broader initial dispositions and counterdispositions of players, to indicate their manner of execution, and otherwise to rely upon action-directing maxims which allow each player a large and necessary amount of autonomy. In sum, in athletics we find autonomy and coordination nicely balanced at all relevant levels. Second, intranational economic order can be achieved only in a world of in- ternational political order; it cannot be achieved so long as unrestricted national sovereignty and, therefore, international anarchy prevail. It is already evident, in fact, that as the cold war of the totalitarian East against the freedom-loving West becomes warmer, the economies of the Western world will tend gradually to be transformed into highly militarized and essentially totalitarian systems. The ultimate way out lies in the establishment of a regime of international law under which all individuals and states must live, and to which they must be made to conform, if and when necessary, by the coercive power lodged at the international level in the United Nations or its successor. If, as is likely, the totalitarian East refuses to participate in such a government of laws at the international level it must be pressed to participate and without too much delay; for the economic and moral cost to the freedom-loving West of delay in this matter is not one that can long be tolerated without serious adverse effects. 28</page><page sequence="29">PROBLEM OF ORDER IN ECONOMIC AFFAIRS Third, it will be difficult to secure and enforce rules of economic order in an economy in which the distribution of wealth is both markedly unequal and with- out the general approval of the population. For marked inequality tends to worsen socio-economic selection; it operates to check incentive and effort, and this tendency is accentuated by the progressive character of the present system of taxation, which is based largely upon income instead of upon capacity to pro- duce income; and it serves to create social dissatisfaction, since few men include in the category of an individual's productivity his having been born in a gilded cradle. A reconsideration of the findings of Rignano, Dalton, and Wedgewood is in order, therefore. Presumably, despite past unsatisfactory experience with death and gift taxes, inequality could be greatly reduced through the use of these taxes and the imposition of ceilings upon the amount of property donatable and/ or bequeathable in the aggregate and to individual direct, or collateral, heirs.81 The preservation of autonomy would require, however: (a) that, as a rule, prop- erty gathered into the hands of the state through such taxation be transferred to private ownership and management; and (b) that gifts and bequests to eleemos- ynary institutions not be subject to limitations, since these institutions constitute bulwarks against the encroachment of the state bureaucracy in many spheres of life in which considerable privately dominated activity is desirable. I have indicated the direction in which the solution of the problem of economic order lies. Whether it will be solved by our society no one knows. Certainly past history does not augur too well for the future. Solution involves action at three levels. First, the problem must be clearly envisaged. Second, the solu- tion must be stated in theoretical terms. I have limited my historical and other discussion to these first two levels. Action at the third level consists in the translation of the theoretical solution into practice; therefore it is by far the most difficult. Yet it is not impossible of realization. And economists can contribute tremendously to its realization by reorienting their economic thinking in terms of this all-inclusive and paramount problem of economic order. 81 Death and gift taxes have not been an important source of income in the past because of difficulties attendant upon their administration. See H. M. Groves, Postwar Taxation and Economic Progress, chap. 9. How much death and gift taxes would contribute if a ceiling were placed upon gifts and bequests as suggested is difficult to determine. Suppose the national wealth is equal to five times the national income and that government absorbs one-fourth of the national income. Then, if 1.5 per cent of the property holders died every year, and the government took all their property, the amount taken would aggregate only 30 per cent of tax income ([.015 X 500] - 25 = 0.3). This percentage is very much reduced, however, by allowances for gifts and bequests subject to little or no taxation. It is not likely, therefore, that death and gift taxes will supply a sizeable fraction of governmental receipts. Death and gift taxes provided 2.3 per cent of federal, state, and local tax revenue in 1942; 1.3 in 1945; and 1.6 in 1946 (see U. S. Bureau of the Census release G-GF46-No. 3 on "Governmental Revenue in 1946"). 29</page></plain_text>
