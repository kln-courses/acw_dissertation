In part, to many readers worldwide, Scholem's oeuvre became synonymous with Kab- balah itself. However, Scholem's interpretation of Kabbalah is precisely that-an interpretation; and like all interpretations, it was historically con- ditioned and ideologically motivated. Scholem's interest in Kabbalah, as David Biale has persuasively shown, was linked to his rejection of the assimilationist tendencies of German Jewry and to his embrace of Zionism.' For Scholem, Wissenschaft des Judentums symbolized the drive of German Jewry for civil rights. Underneath the call for objective, scientific research into the Jewish historical past, the spirituali- zation of Judaism, and the claim that Judaism was compatible with Enlight- enment rationalism lay the apologetic tendencies of petit-bourgeois German Jews struggling for acceptance by the host society. What Scholem called "the myth of the German-Jewish symbiosis" had led Wissenschaft scholars to "take out the irrational sting and remove the demonic passion from Jewish history."2 Consequently, scholars such as Steinschneider, Geiger, and Graetz denounced Kabbalah as medieval obscurantism at its worst: an irritating superstition, an intellectual embarrassment, an obstacle to the civic aspiration of modern Jews. To highlight the development of Kabbalah was to risk impeding the road of German Jewry to social and political emancipation. The Wissenschaft perception of Kabbalah implied the existence of an a priori definition of Judaism by which all else was judged and labeled as either authentic or deviant. Against this view, Scholem advocated a pluralis- tic, anarchic vision of Judaism. Judaism possessed neither an essence nor dogma; neither an overarching philosophical principle nor a core idea. Whatever Jews have thought, written, created, and done in history is Jewish, and as such must be considered the raw data for the Jewish historian. This position was quite consistent with Scholem's view of Zionism, which he saw as the only viable avenue for the modern Jewish intellectual who was estranged from the world of halakhic Judaism to remain committed to his Jewish identity. 1.

In doing so, he not only rehabili- tated Kabbalah from its inferior status in Wissenschaft scholarship; he also put Kabbalah on a pedestal as the most vital element of Judaism, the very secret of its longevity. Without Kabbalah, rabbinic Judaism would have petrified long ago, suffocating under its own aridity. And just as Kabbalah kept rabbinic Judaism alive, so too the historical study of Kabbalah would rejuvenate modern Judaism by exposing the versatility and vitality of rab- binic Judaism. To study the totality of the Jewish experience in history with- out prejudices, preconceptions, and apologetics was a responsible Zionist response to the dilemma of modern Jewish existence. Through critical mastery of the Jewish religious past, Scholem maintained, it was possible for modern Zionists to identify themselves as Jews without embracing the norms of rabbinic Judaism. Scholem placed the study of Kabbalah on firm professional ground. His academic accomplishments are well known: he surveyed much of the corpus of kabbalistic texts in print, as well as in manuscript; he determined the authorship of many anonymous texts; he traced the evolution of major kab- balistic concepts and themes; he outlined the intellectual portrait of leading kabbalists. In short, he mapped out the entire field of kabbalistic literature. But Scholem was not content with mere uncovering of the actual past. and sought also to disclose the general principles which lay behind the causal nexus of the past events. Though Scholem was not a halakhically observant Jew, he did believe in God as the foundation of objective truth and morality. He rejected atheism as intellectually shallow and morally irresponsible. In one of his last interviews, Scholem asserted: "Without God there is no such thing as values or morality that carry any real, binding force."3 Perhaps his own pursuit of objective truth in the study of the past masked a profound religious quest, as Eliezer Schweid has suggested.4 When Scholem moved beyond philology and bibliography to generalize about history or religion, he revealed a surprising loyalty to Hegelian ideal- ism. Even though he rejected the reduction of history to a single idea (be it 3. "With Gershom Scholem: An Interview," in On Jews and Judaism in Crisis, ed. Werner J.

Scholem's idealism was manifested, for example, in his interpreta- tion of Jewish messianism. Scholem distinguished between two types of messianism, the restorative-traditionalist messianism that sought to restore the Jews to a kingdom in the Land of Israel, and the utopian-catastrophic version which entailed the rupture of historical continuity and the advent of a radically new aeon. While Scholem noted the existence of both trends, he focused on the utopian-catastrophic messianism, highlighting its transfor- mative potential. Thus he emphasized the theory of cosmic cycles (in Sefer ha-Temunah and related literature), the notion of a new spiritual Torah (in the Tiqquney Zohar and the Ra'aya Mehemna), and, above all, the outbreak of antinomian messianism in seventeenthh-century Sabbatianism. In the last, Scholem saw at work the force that had corroded rabbinic Judaism from within and paved the way for the emergence of modern Jewish secular- ism (i.e., Haskalah) and Jewish nationalism (i.e., Zionism). Thus, not unlike his predecessors in Wissenschaft des Judentums, Scholem relied on ideas in his interpretation of Jewish history. He regarded an ideational factor (i.e., Lurianic Kabbalah) as the prime cause of Sabbatianism, and considered the dialectics of an idea-the messianic idea-as the primary explanation for the onslaught of modernity in Jewish history. The impact of Hegel was also evident in Scholem's philosophy of reli- gion. Following Hegel, Scholem viewed the first phase of religious con- sciousness as mythical innocence in which the religious believer experiences the gods in a spontaneous, unmediated way. In this paradisiacal phase of human existence, revelation was impossible because no barrier separated man from the gods. The mythical phase, however, ended with the rise of institutional religion, which curbed spontaneity, defined rigid modes of wor- ship, and determined clerical hierarchies. During this creative epoch, religion received its classical formulation. The abyss between God and the religious believer was crossed only by the "voice, the voice of God, directing and law-giving in His revelation, and the voice of man in prayer."' Thus in Scholem's view, religion was grounded in the loss of mythic intimacy between God and man, that is, alienation and distance. The abyss between 5. Gershom Scholem, Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism (New York: Schocken Books, 1967), pp. 7-8.</page><page sequence="5">CONTINUITY AND REVISION IN THE STUDY OF THE KABBALAH 165 God and man can be bridged only through mysticism, the third phase of religious development. Through mysticism the religious believer seeks "to bring back the old unity which religion has destroyed, but on a new plan, where the world of mythology and revelation meet in the soul of man."6 Applying this dialectical scheme to Judaism, Scholem considered both bibli- cal religion and rabbinic Judaism as the second phase of institutionalized religion, and regarded Kabbalah as the mystical bridging over the abyss be- tween God and man. While mysticism, according to Scholem, appears necessarily as the third phase of religious evolution, its specific forms are determined by the particu- larity of the religious tradition. Scholem rejected the notion that mysticism is one and the same in all religious traditions, a view held by prominent scholars of mysticism in the first half of the twentieth century, including Underhill, Jones, Otto, and James. These scholars held that mysticism is one and the same in all religious traditions precisely because it is an unmediated experience of Ultimate Reality, of the Absolute; a numinous experience transcending self and world. Since by definition there can be only one such reality, there can be only one type of religious experience designated as mysticism. In contrast, Scholem asserted: "There is no mysticism as such, there is only the mysticism of a particular religious system, Christian, Islamic, Jewish mysticism and so on."7 Scholem did not deny that there are common characteristics of mystical systems which can be discerned through comparative analysis, but he emphasized the particularity of each mystical tradition. In Scholem's view, Jewish mysticism had a number of distinct features. First, even though some Jewish mystics aspired to union with God, on the whole Jewish mysticism lacked traces of unio mystica. In accordance with the rabbinic insistence on the radical transcendence of God, the abyss be- tween man and God which often lies at the core of the mystical enterprise is never bridged. Jewish mystics remained loyal to the basic tenet of rabbinic theology, the radical transcendence of God. Even if Jewish mystics did expe- 6. Ibid., p. 8. 7. Ibid., p. 6. Scholem patently contradicted himself when he stated that mystical experi- ence is "fundamentally amorphous" and "formless." See Gershom G. Scholem, On the Kab- balah and Its Symbolism, trans. Ralph Manheim (New York: Schocken Books, 1970), p. 8. Schweid already took Scholem to task for lack of consistency in his definition of mysticism; see Judaism and Mysticism, pp. 21-27.</page><page sequence="6">166 HAVA TIROSH-ROTHSCHILD rience identification with God, they nonetheless exercised self-censorship in their reports in order to preserve the principle of divine transcendence. Second, Jewish mysticism was essentially a mysticism of language in which creation and revelation are part of the same process. What exists (the cos- mos) and what is revealed (the Torah) are ultimately the same-infinite permutations of the Divine Name. To penetrate reality, the Jewish mystic must decode the linguistic mysteries of a symbolic text-the Torah. Only through Torah study could the Jewish mystic approach God, who is revealed as a dynamic constellation of ten creative potencies, the Sefirot. This lent Jewish mysticism its particularity and uniqueness as a Jewish phenomenon. The emphasis on the uniqueness of Jewish mysticism and its historical particularity justified the claim that it must be studied by a distinct academic discipline. In 1925 the study of Kabbalah began as a subdiscipline of Jewish philosophy in the Institute of Jewish Studies at the Hebrew University. As the field struggled to establish its academic credentials during the next decades, it focused on itself, giving little consideration to broader methodo- logical questions in the comparative study of religion, even though Scholem himself was well versed in a variety of academic disciplines. In part, Scholem's emphasis on philology and bibliography as the primary tools of historical research hindered the comparative study of Kabbalah even after the establishment of a department for comparative religion at the Hebrew University. One important development was the inclusion of Kabbalah in the Department of Hebrew Literature in the 1950s, a move occasioned by personal politics at the Hebrew University rather than by disciplinary con- siderations. Still, research in Kabbalah did change as a result of this change. If kabbalistic texts were "literature," then they had to be analyzed by the same literary standards applied to other literary texts. By the 1960s and 1970s, this meant that interpretation of kabbalistic texts should conform to the standards of the New Criticism, which dominated the literary scene in Israeli academe. Accordingly, kabbalistic texts were to be interpreted as autonomous entities whose meaning was to be found in them alone. Textual integrity rendered extratextual information inadmissible to the process of interpretation. Thus, Scholem's philological legacy combined with the view of Kabbalah as "literature" led to the primacy of texts in kabbalistic scholarship. A cadre of specialists in Kabbalah concentrated on the author- ship of anonymous texts, edited manuscripts, and, with great precision, traced the transmission of motifs and themes from one text to another. Very</page><page sequence="7">CONTINUITY AND REVISION IN THE STUDY OF THE KABBALAH 167 rarely, however, did Israeli scholars of Kabbalah integrate their analysis of kabbalistic texts with current developments or theoretical debates on the interpretation of texts, especially religious texts. Only limited attention was paid to the interaction between philosophy and Kabbalah, to the role of Kabbalah in the broader matrix of Jewish culture, and to the influence of Kabbalah on European culture. It is precisely this state of affairs which Idel's new work wishes to correct. The publication of Idel's Kabbalah: New Perspectives marks a significant turning point in the academic study of Kabbalah. Building on Scholem's scholarship, Idel respectfully challenges Scholem's methodology, question- ing many of his unspoken assumptions, and proposing alternatives to some of Scholem's most famous assertions. Idel's critique of Scholem is neither malicious nor self-serving. Contrary to several hostile reviews, Idel is not interested in making "a place for himself by overturning the founding figure of the modern field of Jewish mysticism,"8 or in "deposing Scholem and his successors and crowning himself'9 as sole heir to Scholem's reign as master of Kabbalah studies. Nor is Idel engaging in parricide, as one journalist sug- gested,'0 a claim which diminishes the scholarly stature of both Scholem and Idel. Needless to say, such accusations add little to our knowledge of Kab- balah. Kabbalah: New Perspectives is not intended as a book about Scholem, but as an attempt to open new avenues in the study of Kabbalah on the basis of newly discovered material and a reinterpretation of extant data. To cap- ture the central elements of Idel's revision, I will follow the structure of his book. Idel begins by urging his readers to "distinguish between what was understood as Kabbalah according to the Kabbalistic masters who revealed it only fragmentarily, and what contemporary scholars who assumed that the discipline was disclosed in documents, believed to be Kabbalah" (p. 21). In other words, he reminds the reader (especially the non-Hebrew reader) 8. Robert Alter, "Jewish Mysticism in Dispute," Commentary, September 1989, p. 59. 9.

To understand Kabbalah the reader must consult not only the secondary literature but the thousands of manuscripts that lie unread in libraries all over the world. Much like Scholem, Idel urges his readers to listen attentively to the primary sources of Kabbalah without prejudices, preconceived expectations, and ideological preferences. Nonetheless, the profile of Kabbalah that emerges from Idel's reconstruction is significantly different from that popularized through Scholem's studies, and as we shall see, it too is not free of biases. For Idel, Kabbalah is, above all, a multifaceted religious phenomenon. It encompases not only conscious, doctrinal, and speculative dimensions recorded in texts, but also experiential, performative, and even unconscious dimensions. The texts only hint at these nonliterary aspects; they hardly exhaust them. Rejecting what he calls "an ideology of textology," Idel thus diminishes the importance of texts in the interpretation of religion. (In this respect, there is an interesting similarity between Idel's approach to religion and Buber's in his debate with Scholem on the interpretation of Hasidism.)" Reflecting the impact of anthropology on current trends in religious studies, Idel argues that texts and the doctrines they espouse are but the tip of the religious iceberg; the bulk is hidden beneath the surface of the empirical, textual evidence. According to Idel, one consequence of the undue focus on the literary and doctrinal was that Kabbalah was apprehended as a specula- tive system of thought with its own metaphysics, cosmology, psychology, and epistemology. Idel implies (though he does not say so directly) that such overintellectualization betrays Scholem's rationalist bent and philosophic, training in German academe. According to Idel, the proper methodology for the study of Kabbalah is phenomenology of religion (p. 24). Idel does not define phenomenology, but he appears to hold that it is an interpretive method that makes things "become manifest," a form of revealing something "as it is." He believes that phenomenology lets things become manifest as they are, without forc- ing our own categories on them. (Whether this is at all possible is a question which Idel does not address systematically, but his critique of Scholem in- dicates the limits of the phenomenological method.) For Idel phenomeno- 11.

Influenced by Mircea Eliade (his opposition to Eliade's nefarious past notwithstanding), Idel recognizes reli- gion as sui generis, and seeks to unearth the deep structures of the homo religiosus, i.e., the kabbalist. Like Eliade, Idel not only listens to his primary sources with great empathy. He also tries to grasp what Kabbalah could have meant for its practitioners. And what emerges is that Kabbalah was to them neither a mere literary tradition of sacred texts nor a speculative system, but rather a way of life, a praxis, a mode of religious orientation toward the sacred and the profane. To understand better the life and mind of the kabbalist, Idel urges scho- lars to enter a dialogue with contemporary practitioners of Kabbalah.'2 He thus undermines the demand for textual purism which prevailed hitherto in the academic study of Kabbalah. In a recent interview Idel justified the use of extratextual evidence by invoking the analogy of a soccer game. If to understand the game of soccer we must go to an actual game and not merely read books about its rules, then to understand Kabbalah we must meet Jews who live by it.'3 Idel adduces his own personal contacts with Jewish mystics in Bnai Brak and Jerusalem as evidence that such encounters can be fruitful. (However, Idel's optimism concerning the openness of contemporary kab- balists to female scholars [p. 26] is questionable.) Whether the dialogue between scholars and kabbalists is indeed desirable depends on one's metho- dology in the interpretation of texts. Idel at least compels his colleagues to reexamine their assumptions on textual interpretation. As a phenomenologist of religion, Idel must trust the original intention- ality of his sources. The early masters of Kabbalah claimed that they were the recipients of an esoteric oral tradition dating back to Sinai. Idel is willing to seriously consider this claim and argues that medieval Kabbalah originat- ed in esoteric teachings dating back (at least) to the tannaitic period which were preserved in and transmitted by certain families from generation to 12. Scholem did not ignore the importance of live encounter with practicing kabbalists. In 1927 he established contacts with the kabbalists of Beth El to whom he referred in his scholarly works. Still, Idel is correct to note that Scholem did not encourage other scholars of Kabbalah to cultivate such contacts. 13. The analogy is probably derived from Hans-Georg Gadamer, "Hermeneutics as Prac- tical Philosophy," in Reason in the Age of Science, trans. Frederick Lawrence (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1981), p. 110.</page><page sequence="10">170 HAVA TIROSH-ROTHSCHILD generation. Idel implicitly asks: If we accept that biblical narratives are root- ed in prebiblical oral traditions, recognize that halakhic traditions were transmitted orally before and after the codification of the Mishnah and Talmud, why should we be so skeptical about an oral transmission of esoter- ic teachings about the nature of God? If orality is integral to Jewish self- perception, education, scholarly ideals, and theology, why should we exclude it from our interpretation of Kabbalah? In other words, in the debate over the antiquity of Kabbalah (a debate which turned into a public controversy during the last quarter of the fifteenth century), Idel essentially sides with the kabbalists. Kabbalah is indeed an ancient oral tradition. Only historical circumstances, i.e., the dissemination of Maimonidean rational- ism, compelled the recipients of Kabbalah to shift from orality to writing and to surface as an historical movement. Idel states: Kabbalah emerged in the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries as a sort of reaction to the dismissal of earlier mystical traditions by Maimonides' auda- cious reinterpretation of Jewish esotericism and his attempt to replace mysti- cal traditions with a philosophical understanding. Kabbalah can be viewed as part of a restructuring of those aspects of rabbinic thought that were denied authenticity by Maimonides' system. (p. 253) Aside from the relationship between philosophy and Kabbalah (to which we shall return later), Idel's argument for the existence of a preliter- ate, oral phase in the evolution of Kabbalah merits serious consideration. Recent studies in the field of linguistic anthropology appear to support some of Idel's contentions. For example, Walter Ong shows that oral societies invest great energy in saying over and over again what has been arduously learned over the ages. As a result, oral cultures exhibit a highly traditionalist or conservative mind-set which inhibits intellectual experimentation.'4 The shift from orality to literacy frees the mind from its conservative task, thus allowing for greater creativity. This theory could support Idel's portrayal of the early masters of Kabbalah (e.g., R. Abraham ben David, R. Isaac Sagi Nahor, R. Moses ben Nahman) as preservers of received esoteric traditions. Commiting oral traditions to writing might explain the unusual creativity of 14. Walter Ong, Orality and Literacy: The Technologizing of the Word (London: Methuen, 1982), p. 41.</page><page sequence="11">CONTINUITY AND REVISION IN THE STUDY OF THE KABBALAH 171 Kabbalah during the late thirteenth century, whose ultimate testimony was Sefer ha-Zohar. To be fully substantiated, Idel's hypothesis of a preliterate phase to Kab- balah requires further research. Researchers of Kabbalah will have to con- sult the extensive scholarship on the nature of oral cultures and new studies about orality and literacy in late antiquity and the Middle Ages."5 The very fact that Judaism (like Christianity and Islam) is a religious tradition grounded in the transmission and interpretation of canonic Scriptures makes any claim for exclusively oral teaching quite problematic. Further analysis of the early medieval masters of Kabbalah in Provence and Gerona must also be undertaken in order to establish Idel's claim that they merely preserved received traditions. So far, Elliot Wolfson's study of Nahmanides convincingly argues that kabbalistic interpretation was "an innovative transformation of aggadic passages in light of a theosophic system that may itself have older roots in Jewish mythologumena, but which is, in most cases, extraneous to the rabbinic material."'6 Wolfson also emphasized the centrality of Sefer ha-Bahir, that is, a literary text which Nahmanides and all other kabbalists accepted as tannaitic midrash, in the formation of his innovative kabbalistic exegesis. Furthermore, the alleged conservatism of early kabbalists could not have been restricted to Kabbalah and must have been evident in other dimensions of their religious activities. Nahmanides, for example, wrote talmudic novellae. Does Nahmanides' halakhic oeuvre manifest the same conservatism Idel ascribes to his Kabbalah? If not, does Idel hold the implausible view that Kabbalah is by nature conservative while Halakhah is innovative? We should also wonder to what extent the very traditionalist self-perception of rabbinic Judaism imposes a "conservative" public posture that masks innovations. After all, the very idea of Oral Torah was a radical innovation, notwithstanding the rabbis' claim to the contrary. The very fact that several kabbalists (the editors of Sefer ha-Bahir, the authors of Sefer ha-Iyyun and related literature, the authors of Sefer ha-Temunah and its cognate texts, and, of course, the author of the Zohar) resorted to pseudoepigraphy attests that they were fully aware of the tension 15.

In short, while Idel's hypothesis opens a fruitful avenue for further exploration, the origins of Kabbalah remain shrouded in mystery. If medieval Kabbalah originated in oral traditions, how can the modern researcher retrieve them? Idel proposes the "reconstructionist approach" as an alternative to the "ideology of textology." He defines the reconstruction- ist approach as "an attempt to use the more elaborate conceptual structures of the Kabbalah in order to examine various ancient motifs and to organize them in coherent structures" (p. 32). Idel holds that the extant fragments of kabbalistic texts contain the traces of hidden mental structures which consti- tute the kabbalistic conception of reality. It is not entirely clear what consti- tutes a "structure" and how the researcher is to differentiate between one structural unit and another. What is clear is that Idel has in mind a mam- moth project analogous in scope and complexity to the contemporary attempts to reconstruct the human genome. Idel is fully aware of the daunt- ing scope of his proposal and does not claim to have completed it. He begins by identifying three such structural units (to be mentioned below) in order to chart the road which the future study of Kabbalah must travel. The reconstructionist approach is decidedly ahistorical. The hidden structures of Kabbalah are culled from texts that span several historical epochs, centuries apart. More importantly, the reconstructionist approach is based on circular reasoning. Idel reads early material (say a sixth- century midrash) in light of a later kabbalistic text, and then argues that the former persisted in the latter. In other words, Idel's structuralist reconstruc- tion problematically assumes the existence of a continous tradition which he then sets out to prove. Idel is aware of this methodological pitfall and attempts to guard against it by arguing that analysis of many texts is neces- sary for the reconstruction of the hidden structures of Kabbalah. While a quantitative analysis is indeed necessary to substantiate Idel's claim, it does not resolve this methodological problem. Also problematic is the attempt to reconstruct the hidden mental structures of Kabbalah on the basis of an affinity, or similarity, among verbal expressions. Idel assumes that terms largely retain their meaning over time, though this is, of course, a highly debatable claim. Moreover, the very emphasis on verbal affinity indicates that Idel himself remains within the textual circle from which he is attempt- ing to break loose. Finally, Idel's commitment to the phenomenology of reli- gion is not consistent because he often attempts to establish causal links among disparate events, as historians do. The problem is that he adduces</page><page sequence="13">CONTINUITY AND REVISION IN THE STUDY OF THE KABBALAH 173 ahistorical "structures" in order to prove historical causation. When he shifts from phenomenology to history, Idel turns out to be a traditional his- torian of ideas who traces the evolution of concepts in literary traditions with but limited interest in the social context of these ideas. At times, he proves thematic continuity by showing that a given text was accessible (or could have been accessible) to a certain kabbalist at a certain time and place (for example, p. 107). Historians might feel uncomfortable at this type of explanation; conversely, phenomenologists of religion would wonder how his phenomenology collapsed into textuality. Though he does not specifically say so, Idel's reconstructionist approach betrays the impact of French structuralism. By structuralism I mean "the systematic attempt to uncover deep universal mental structures as these manifest themselves in kinship and larger social structures, in literature, philosophy and mathematics, and in the unconscious psychological patterns that motivate human behavior."''7 Like Levi-Strauss, the father of structur- alist anthropology, Idel includes the unconscious, the irrational, and the paranormal within the scope of scholarly interpretations of human beha- vior. He thus departs from Scholem's rationalist skepticism, which insisted that scientific inquiry rely on empirical data.'" If Idel is skeptical, his skepti- cism pertains to the nature of scientific knowledge. Human knowledge, so he seems to hold, is at best partial, incomplete, prone to revisions, and above all historically situated. Idel's sensitivity to the historicality of knowl- edge (apparently under the influence of Gadamer and Ricoeur) leads him to view Scholem in the intellectual context of his generation. Not surprisingly, Idel is among the few Hebrew University scholars who publicly endorsed David Biale's controversial biography of Scholem.19 However, Idel's readi- 17. Edith Kurzweil, The Age of Structuralism: Levi-Strauss to Foucault (New York: Colum- bia University Press, 1980), p. 1. Obviously, this definition does not do justice to the complexity of structuralism. Even though structuralism means different things in literary theory, anthro- pology, and the history of religions, I maintain that the term accurately describes Idel's enter- prise. Unfortunately, Idel does not make clear the hidden assumptions which structuralism brings to the study of religion in general and to his own analysis of Kabbalah in particular. 18. Schweid noted that Scholem intentionally cultivated the public persona of the empiri- cist scholar; see Schweid, Judaism and Mysticism, p. 10. Indeed, some scholars defend this self- portrayal as the exclusive way of understanding Scholem's oeuvre.

See Micha Odenheimer, "A Tale of Two Kabbalists," Jerusalem Post Magazine, 19 May 1989, p. 9.</page><page sequence="14">174 HAVA TIROSH-ROTHSCHILD ness to accept the historicality of knowledge undermines his phenomenolo- gical approach and his attempt to uncover the hidden structures of Kab- balah. Much of Idel's critique of Scholem's legacy can be construed as a dialo- gue between post-World War II France and pre-World War I Germany. Born in Romania in 1947, Idel's intellectual orientation is decidedly French, reflecting the impact of French culture on the Romanian intelligentsia. By name, Idel cites only a handul of scholars (Levi-Strauss, Foucault, Ricoeur, Barthes), but it is evident that he is intimately familiar with current debates and modes of thought in French academe. Unfortunately, Idel does not engage any of the thinkers who inform his thought in an open methodologi- cal or substantive discussion. Instead, he prefers to remain an eclectic, prag- matic thinker who incorporates whatever he finds useful in the interpreta- tion of available kabbalistic data. In line with the structuralist perspective, Idel seeks to uncover the latent though constant mental structures which persisted throughout the long history of rabbinic Judaism. III Phenomenologically, Idel asserts, Kabbalah consisted of two distinct trends-the "ecstatic-unitive" and the "theosophic-theurgic." These two trends are radically different from each other: whereas ecstatic Kabbalah concerns altering the mystic's state of consciousness, theurgic Kabbalah per- tains to external reality. Whereas ecstatic Kabbalah is anthropocentric, the theosophic-theurgic Kabbalah is theocentric. Whereas ecstatic Kabbalah developed through close interaction with philosophy (Jewish and non- Jewish), the theosophic-theurgic Kabbalah comprised authentic, internal Jewish traditions. Whereas ecstatic Kabbalah shunned symbolism, theo- sophic-theurgic Kabbalah was intrinsically linked to symbolism. And if ecstatic Kabbalah tended to develop within a rationalist system, theosophic- theurgic Kabbalah was essentially mythical. The origins of both trends are to be found in the rabbinic Judaism of antiquity; neither was a medieval innovation. The ecstatic-unitive trend is rooted in the Hekhalot and Merka- bah literature and reached its zenith in the prophetic Kabbalah of Abraham Abulafia in the last decades of the thirteenth century. Meanwhile, the origins of the theosophic-theurgic trend can be found in early tannaitic material and the early rabbinic midrashim; its medieval zenith is Sefer ha- Zohar, the magnum opus of Spanish Kabbalah.</page><page sequence="15">CONTINUITY AND REVISION IN THE STUDY OF THE KABBALAH 175 The above typology of Kabbalah is not Idel's invention. It is derived from the primary sources, specifically from Abraham Abulafia. Modern scholarship has not been oblivious to the existence of these two trends. Scholem himself hinted at it when he stated that Abraham Abulafia and Sefer ha-Zohar "belong to two opposing schools in Spanish Kabbalism, schools which I would like to call the ecstatic and the theosophical."20 Together the chapters on Abulafia and Sefer ha-Zohar in Major Trends out- line many of the features discussed by Idel in greater detail. Idel goes beyond Scholem in applying this typology to individual texts, kabbalists, and reli- gious postures, as well as in charting the dissemination of Kabbalah after the expulsion from Spain.21 Idel continues to detect the two trends of Kab- balah in the early modern period. The theosophic-theurgic trend of Lurianic Kabbalah shaped the theology of Nathan of Gaza and served as the theoret- ical underpinning of the Sabbatian movement. Meanwhile, the ecstatic- unitive trend of Abulafia influenced the religious orientation of Hasidic masters in the eighteenth century. Such affinity was noted already (but was not analyzed) by Joseph Weiss, an earlier phenomenologist of Hasidism who should have been mentioned.22 This typology of Kabbalah is helpful as long as it is not taken too rigidly. On the basis of Idel's own detailed documentation, the two trends were textually and phenomenologically intertwined. For example, there were theosophic kabbalists (e.g., R. Ezra and R. Azriel) who exhibited strong ecstatic-unitive tendencies. They delved into the mystery of the Godhead in order to obtain a unitive experience with God or with supermundane beings. Conversely, there were kabbalists (e.g., Yohanan Alemanno) whose ecstatic- unitive experiences were used to effect either theurgic or magical results. In 20. Scholem, Major Trends, p. 124. 21. In other studies, Idel distinguishes between a "northern" route (Spain-Italy-the Balkans-Greece) and a "southern" route (Spain-North Africa-Egypt) in the dissemination of Kabbalah. See Moshe Idel, "Major Currents in Italian Kabbalah between 1560-1660," Italia Judaica II (Rome, 1987), pp. 243-262; idem, "R. Judah Haliwah and His Work Sefer Zafnat Pa'neab" (in Hebrew), Shalem 4 (1984): 119-148. The relationship between the geography of Kabbalah and the phenomenology of Kabbalah is not entirely clear. It seems to me that Idel does suggest some correlation between the two routes for the dissemination of Kabbalah and the two trends in the phenomenology of Kabbalah, but he does not fully clarify it. To assume otherwise would imply that the phenomenology of Kabbalah is not manifested in its history, a position that Idel could not possibly hold. 22. See Joseph Weiss, Studies in Eastern European Jewish Mysticism, ed. David Goldstein (New York: Oxford University Press, 1985), p. 104.</page><page sequence="16">176 HAVA TIROSH-ROTHSCHILD fifteenth-century Italy, in particular, one can find a peculiar fusion of Abulafian and Zoharic Kabbalah which defies a rigid application of Idel's typology. Perhaps it is more useful to view the two trends in Kabbalah as two poles of one continuum. Most kabbalists, and most kabbalistic texts, were somewhere in the middle of the continuum, that is, at a point where the aspiration to unite with God was fused with the desire to affect God. The Ecstatic- Unitive Trend What Idel calls the ecstatic-unitive trend of Kabbalah overlaps with what most scholars of religion designate generally as mysticism. Indeed, for much of the book, Idel uses the terms "mysticism" and "ecstatic-unitive" interchangeably. Mysticism, Idel states, is "the quintessence of religion," and the "sense of union with God" is the "quintessence of mysticism." Idel then offers a more elaborate definition of mysticism as follows: The intensification of religious life that characterizes most forms of mysticism culminates at times in paranormal experiences, whose literary expression appears in description of unitive relations with supermundane beings and sometimes ultimately with God himself. (p. 35) If mysticism is the intensified mode of a given religion, it follows that the difference between the mystic and the ordinary religious practitioner is but a matter of degree. Therefore, in Idel's definition, Kabbalah (qua mysticism and qua theurgy) does not stand in dialectical opposition to institutionalized rabbinic Judaism (as Scholem proposed). Rather it is a "distilled" version of that religious tradition. Moreover, if identification with God is the "quint- essence" of mysticism, Kabbalah must consist of unitive experiences. Against Scholem (and all who followed him) Idel argues that testimonies of unio-mystica abound in Kabbalah. Idel's treatment of mysticism shifts the emphasis from the speculative-doctrinal dimension to the experiential- psychological dimension. The mystical experience effects an extraordinary, paranormal, altered state of consciousness which the mystic interprets as identification with God. Mystical experiences, however, can be known only if they are interpreted and communicated to others (in an oral or a literal form). The problem is that the mystic usually interprets his/her experience in terms of doctrines</page><page sequence="17">CONTINUITY AND REVISION IN THE STUDY OF THE KABBALAH 177 presupposed to be true. Indeed, the relationship between the mystical ex- perience and its interpretation is one of the most vexing problems in the study of mysticism. In recent articles devoted to methodological and episte- mological problems in the interpretation of mysticism, Steven Katz has argued that there is no unmediated experience as such, mystical or other- wise. All mystical experiences are shaped by the concepts which the mystic brings to the experience. Thus, the mystic's prior religious training, social context, and belief-system condition the nature of his/her mystical experi- ence.23 Katz's position lends credence to Scholem's view that mystical ex- perience cannot be cross-cultural; a Christian mystic and a Jewish mystic do not undergo the same type of religious experience even when they both talk about union with God. Rather, their mystical experiences differ from each other as much as the truth claims of their respective religions do. Idel is fully aware of Katz's studies, but does not address them in full. Quite surprisingly, Idel claims that the individual experience of the mystic remains beyond the inquiry of the phenomenologist of religion. The momentary, actual mystical experience cannot be reconstructed or recap- tured. Against Katz, Idel goes on to claim that the pre-experience condi- tioning is evident "more in the form of the written expression . . than in the contents of that experience itself' (p. 36). Almost to the point of self- contradiction, Idel concedes to Katz that "there is a good chance that theological and sociological factors enter into the experience," but he claims that they are not so important in the interpretation of mysticism. Accord- ingly Idel distinguishes between the "core" and the "shell" of the mystical experience and argues that only the latter is culturally conditioned. This answer is unsatisfactory. First, if the mystical experience itself is beyond the pale of phenomenology, then Idel offers us not a phenomenology of mysti- cism but rather a morphology of mediated experiences reported in texts. 23. Steven T. Katz, "Language, Epistemology, and Mysticism," in Mysticism and Philo- sophical Analysis, ed. Steven Katz (New York: Oxford University Press, 1978), pp. 22-74; idem, "The 'Conservative' Character of Mystical Experience," in Mysticism and Religious Tra- ditions (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1983), pp. 3-60. For a recent critique of Katz's position, see J. William Forgie, "Hyper-Kantianism in Recent Discussions of Mystical Experi- ence," Religious Studies 21 (1985): 205-218. To some extent, Idel attempted to present an alter- native to Katz's position in a volume he edited with Bernard McGinn, Mystical Union and Monotheistic Faith: An Ecumenical Dialogue (New York: Macmillan, 1989), but the methodolo- gical difficulties discussed below remain intact.</page><page sequence="18">178 HAVA TIROSH-ROTHSCHILD Here again Idel returns to the primacy of texts in the interpretation of Kab- balah. Second, it is not clear how it is possible to differentiate between the "core" and the "shell" of the mystical experience if all we have is a written report about the experience. "The medium is the message" whether we like it or not. Third, if it is the mediated reports of mystical experiences upon which Idel relies, then those may reflect a certain religious ideal, a desired state, or even a cultural convention, rather than actual mystical experience. Fourth, verbal affinity among disparate mystical reports may not be suffi- cient to prove that the mystics who wrote these reports underwent the same type of unitive experience. It is even more problematic to use verbal affinity to show a causal link between two mystical experiences (for example, between the writings of Abulafia in the thirteenth century and Hasidic mys- tical testimonies in the eighteenth century). Such a causal link is valid only if both sets of mystics adhered to the same conceptual framework. In fact, Idel's detailed analysis of devequt in chapter 3 appears to lend support to the claim that mystical experiences (and not only their interpreta- tions) are culturally bound. Idel argues compellingly that while cleaving to God is a biblical commandment, the ideal of devequt flourished in Judaism under the direct impact of medieval philosophy. The various conceptions of devequt in Kabbalah manifest an intimate dependency on Aristotelianism, Neoplatonism, and Hermeticism. Among thirteenth-century kabbalists, Aristotelian epistemology led to the interpretation of devequt as an intellec- tual union between the knower, the known, and the act of knowing. From medieval Neoplatonism kabbalists derived the notion of devequt as a union between the individual and the universal soul, and under the influence of Hermeticism, devequt was understood to be a union between the spiritually perfected soul of the mystic as an archmagician and spiritual entities. It is doubtful that all three notions of devequt reflect the same type of mystical experience, as Idel would have us believe. Very enlightening is Idel's discussion of "mysticism of descent," which appears in Kabbalah under the influence of Hermeticism. As the writings of Judah Halevi and Abraham ibn Ezra attest, medieval Jews had access to Hermetic literature through Arabic translations long before the corpus was recovered in the fifteenth century by Marsilio Ficino and his Florentine Academy. Abulafia incorporated Hermetic magical practices into his ela- borate mystical system. According to Idel, the Hermetic "descent magic gradually changed into mysticism of descent in which supernal spirits- commonly designated as rulhaniyut, spiritual beings-were drawn by the</page><page sequence="19">CONTINUITY AND REVISION IN THE STUDY OF THE KABBALAH 179 mystics upon themselves, the latter thereby attaining a mystical union" (p. 41). Yet the phenomenon of mysticism of descent in Italian Kabbalah during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries suggests that the two trends of Kabbalah-the unitive-ecstatic and the theosophic-theurgic-were more closely connected than Idel's typology indicates. The mystic's ability to con- nect with spiritual entities is not always the result of an internal psychic process induced by specific meditational techniques (as was the case with Abulafia), but also the outcome of the mystic's knowledge of the Godhead which he utilizes for theurgic purposes. The activation of the Deity through theurgy brings about an overflow of the divine efflux which the mystic harnesses either for further unitive experiences or in order to manipulate nature (i.e., magic). Thus, it stands to reason that the intellectual bent of the mystic and the cultural context in which he operated determined the inter- play between the two poles of Kabbalah. Idel is persuasive in his argument that unio mystica existed in Kabbalah. Some mystically inclined kabbalists desired and occasionally believed them- selves to have attained identification with God, as did mystics in other religions. To these Jewish mystics devequt was the "reintegration of the human into the primordial unity, whose other half was Divine" (p. 63). Idel proves the existence of unio mystica (though it is not clear whether it is intended or actual) by discussing the following literary motifs: the reunifica- tion of two half-circles, the joining of letters in the word ADAM, the absorption of the drop into the ocean, and the swallowing of individual souls by the Deity. These expressions challenge Scholem's view, according to which the Jewish mystic "almost invariably retains a sense of distance be- tween the Creator and his creature" (p. 59). Interestingly, Scholem, who was so sensitive to the threat mysticism posed to religious authority, portrayed the kabbalists as theologically conservative. They would rather abide by the theological tenets of their religion and exercise self-censorship than be true to their personal religious experience. For Scholem, the tension between mysticism and normative rabbinic authority was creative and led to the renewal of the tradition. However, it is ironic that Scholem defined mysti- cism as a unitive experience in his generalization about religion, but denied the existence of such experiences in his discussion of Kabbalah as an histor- ical phenomenon.24 In contrast, Idel, who claims that Kabbalah preserved 24. I owe this point to Elliot Wolfson in a private conversation.</page><page sequence="20">180 HAVA TIROSH-ROTHSCHILD authentic rabbinic teachings, nonetheless insists that some Jewish mystics (especially Abulafia and those influenced by him) had no qualms about reporting on their temporary identification with God, divine transcendence notwithstanding. Thus, there is no necessary dialectical tension between mystics and religious authorities. Whether one endorses Scholem or Idel depends not only on how one defines mysticism but also on one's under- standing of Judaism. Idel's deconstruction of Scholem's position exposes Scholem as a loyal heir of the Wissenschaft conception of Judaism which Scholem had disputed. Not without justification, Idel portrays Scholem as a rationalist thinker, committed to idealism, who held a rather dogmatic view of Judaism as ethical monotheism. Idel subtly implies that Scholem's interpretation of Kabbalah exhibits some of the shortcomings he himself attributed to Wissenschaft scholarship: the removal of the irrational through excessive theologization and spiritualization, idealization of the past, and apologetics.25 One of Idel's major contributions to the study of Jewish mysticism lies in his outlining of the techniques Jewish mystics used in order to induce ecstatic-unitive experiences. Chapter 5 is a mine of new data and insightful analysis of such mystical techniques as ritualized weeping, ascent of the soul, combination and recitation of letters, contemplation of the Tetragramma- ton, and visualization of colors. While some of these techniques are nomian (i.e., they are internalized halakhic practices performed with kavanah in order to lead to devequt), others are anomian (i.e., they do not involve hala- khic practices) (p. 74). Anomian mystical practices in particular manifest the parallels between Jewish mysticism and other mystical systems, such as Hinduism and Sufism (and in certain cases direct borrowing from them). The very existence of anomian mystical techniques challenges Idel's attempt to minimize the tension between mysticism and religious authority. In reli- gious traditions founded on the belief in divine revelation, ecstatic experi- ences interpreted as prophecies from God pose a challenge to those authori- tative figures who present themselves as the sole legitimate interpreters of the tradition. Jewish mystics could (and some did) use their ecstatic experi- ences to reinterpret the revealed tradition, to institute new religious norms and rituals, or even to question the very validity of the tradition. In other words, anomianism could lead to antinomianism. The antinomian potential 25. See Scholem, Explications and Implications, pp. 396-397.</page><page sequence="21">CONTINUITY AND REVISION IN THE STUDY OF THE KABBALAH 181 was particularly strong when the mystic interpreted his revelatory experi- ences in messianic categories (as was the case with Abulafia, Sabbatai Sevi, and perhaps even Moses de Leon).26 To say the least, a strong mystical impulse could lead a mystic to subordinate the performance of miSvot to the attainment of devequt as an individual spiritual end. This was the case with mystically inclined rationalist philosophers in the Middle Ages. Yet Abula- fia's case is perhaps the best example of ecstatic Kabbalah being perceived as a challenge to Halakhah. R. Solomon ben Adret placed his writings and public activities under a ban, a fact to which Idel draws attention, but does not fully analyze in this context. It seems to me that such a discussion would prove that, after all, Scholem was right to note the anomian impulses of Abulafia's mysticism. Abulafia's danger lay not so much in his prophetic and messianic self-perception but in the likelihood that his highly idio- syncratic mystical manuals could have given rise to anomian lay mysticism. One of the mystical techniques Idel discusses is ritualized weeping. The idea that weeping played an important role in religious rites was noted first by Huizinga and analyzed in detail by the Italian anthropologist Ernesto de Martino.27 While I accept Idel's claim that ritualized weeping was an authentic technique used by some Jewish mystics over the ages, his analysis of this technique exemplifies the methodological obstacle in the interpre- tation of mystical testimonies. The examples of ritualized weeping (pp. 75-88) seem to support Katz's contention that the pre-experience beliefs of the mystic determine the content of the mystical experience. In most of these reports, weeping was related to the desire of the male mystic to encounter 26. Yehudah Liebes, "The Messiah of Sefer ha-Zohar" (in Hebrew), in Ha-Ra'ayon ha-Meshihi be-Yis'ra'el (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1982), pp. 87-236. 27. See J. Huizinga, The Waning of the Middle Ages (Garden City: Doubleday, 1954), p. 191; Ernesto de Martino, Morte e pianto rituale nel mondo antico: Dal lamento pagano al pianto di Maria (Turin: Edizioni Scientifiche Einaudi, 1958). For more recent discussions of ritual weeping by ethnographists, see William A. Christian, "Provoked Religious Weeping in Early Modern Spain," in Religious Organization and Religious Experience, ed. J. Davis (London: Academic Press, 1982), pp. 97-114; Laura Graham, "Three Modes of Shavante Vocal Expres- sion: Wailing, Collective Singing, and Political Oratory," in Native South American Discourse, ed. Joel Scherzer and Greg Urban (Amsterdam: Mouton de Gruyter, 1986), pp. 83-118; Charles Wagley, Welcome of Tears (London: Oxford University Press, 1978). Idel's emphasis on the performative dimension of mystical techniques should be viewed in the broader context of current attempts to deprivilize texts in the interpretation of religious systems. For a metho- dological analysis of this enterprise, see Lawrence E. Sullivan, "Sound and Senses: Toward a Hermeneutics of Performance," History of Religions 26, no. 1 (1986): 1-33.</page><page sequence="22">182 HAVA TIROSH-ROTHSCHILD the Shekhinah, the feminine aspect of God. Weeping could be conducive to such encounter only if the mystic already believed that the Shekhinah was a female who would respond to crying as women normally do. It is not sur- prising that Abulafia had little use for ritualized weeping, because he expressly rejected the ontology of the Sefirot and their symbolism. In accor- dance with his Maimonidean epistemology and cosmology, Abulafia designed different mystical techniques. Moreover, it is not entirely clear (as Robert Alter has observed) when weeping is used consciously and intention- ally to produce an altered state of consciousness, and when it is but an emotional response to prior psychological stress or spiritual anguish. That these mystical experiences are reported to have occurred in dreams further complicates the issue. Fearing reductionism, Idel refuses to apply psychoan- alytic theories to the interpretation of mystical dreams, thus leaving them uninterpreted. But if we wish to understand what Kabbalah means for its practitioners, as Idel does, then it seems worthwhile to ask what it means for an anguished, crying, adult male to encounter God as a beautiful young woman whom he mistakes for his mother (p. 81). Perhaps the contemporary practitioners of Kabbalah, with whom Idel confers and who live by the strict sexual code of traditional Judaism, could shed some light on the encounter between male mystics and the Heavenly Female. Does the erotic language of these encounters pertain only to the post-experience interpretation (as Idel holds), or does the mystical experience consist of sexual fantasies by male mystics who envision God as a female? If the latter is the case, there is room to ponder the impact of Kabbalah on the status and welfare of Jewish women in the earthly domain. Even though we assume (though we cannot prove) that Jewish mystics were all married males, their wives were either inconsequential to their religious activities or, at best, a means toward the attainment of mystical or theurgic ends. I suspect that Kabbalah exacerbat- ed the marginalization of women in traditional Jewish society precisely because it expressed (or satisfied) the sexual and erotic needs of Jewish men. Though Idel is generally attuned to the centrality of sexuality in Kabbalah, he does not explore in this study the psychological or sociocultural mean- ings of erotic mystical testimonies. Interestingly, Scholem was very straightforward about the masculine nature of Kabbalah and its exclusion of females. He boldly asserted: "Both historically and metaphysically it is a masculine doctrine, made for men and by men."28 Therefore Scholem could ponder the psychological significance 28. Scholem, Major Trends, p. 37.</page><page sequence="23">CONTINUITY AND REVISION IN THE STUDY OF THE KABBALAH 183 of the Shekhinah for male mystics, which he did in a lecture before the Eranos Society in Ascona, Switzerland. In a veiled reference to Erich Neumann's famous study, The Great Mother, Scholem hinted at the pos- sibility of using Jung's psychoanalytic theory to interpret the symbol of the Shekhinah. That lecture, however, made little impact on Israeli academe until 1976, when it was translated into Hebrew by Joseph Ben Shlomo for Scholem's Pirqey Yesod be-Havanat ha-Qabbalah u-Semaleha.29 In his own public lectures at the Hebrew University in 1962, Scholem was less forth- coming (and at times plainly contradictory) concerning the similarity between the Sefirotic symbolism and Jung's psychoanalytic theory and, more generally, in regard to the usefulness of psychoanalysis in the interpre- tation of Kabbalah. "If we knew more history we would need less psycho- logy," he testily snapped in response to a student's inquiry.30 Did Scholem reject psychoanalysis because it undermined his public image as a rational- ist, epiricist historian, or because he shared the Zionist ambivalence toward psychoanalysis?31 Without answering this, I believe that if we wish to under- stand the dissemination of Kabbalah and its role in Jewish culture we must explore the psychological import of kabbalistic sexual fantasies. The Theosophic-Theurgic Trend The centrality of sexuality in Kabbalah becomes more apparent when we shift our focus from the unitive-ecstatic trend to the theosophic-theurgic one (chaps. 6-8). Idel concedes that "the mainstream in Kabbalistic thought undoubtedly is the theosophical Kabbalah, whose dominant con- ception is that of a complex and dynamic structure of divine powers com- 29.

Joseph Ben Shlomo (Jerusalem: Mosad Bialik, 1976), pp. 259-307, esp. p. 277, where Scholem cites the symbol of the Great Mother without direct reference to Erich Neumann's study. In an interview Scholem expressly distinguished Erich Neumann the man, whom he "greatly esteemed," from Erich Neumann the psychoanalyst, claiming he "often did not understand" what the latter was saying. See On Jews and Judaism, p. 30. I remain skeptical about Scholem's alleged inability to understand Jungian psychoanalysis. 30.

For example, see "Back to Vienna: Zionism on the Literary Couch," in Vision Confronts Reality: Historical Perspectives on the Contemporary Jewish Agenda, edited by R. Kozodoy, D. Sidorsky and K. Sultanik (Associated University Presses. London and Toronto, 1989), 310-337.</page><page sequence="24">184 HAVA TIROSH-ROTHSCHILD monly known as Sefirot" (p. 112). He thus appears to support Scholem's view that theosophy rather than mysticism was the core of Kabbalah. Yet Idel's interpretation of kabbalistic theosophy varies greatly from Scholem's. I will comment only on the most salient points of Idel's richly documented and provocative revision. Idel argues that kabbalistic theosophy was but an elaboration of mental constructs that already existed in rabbinic literature. Using the reconstruc- tionist methods discussed above, he focuses on three theosophic constructs to prove this claim: (a) the anthropomorphic decad of creative forces; (b) the seventy-two hypostases, or "forms" (surot); and (c) the motif of du-pargufim. The gist of Idel's reconstruction is to challenge the prevalent theory that kabbalistic theosophy originated in Gnostic, non-Jewish mater- ial, which infiltrated Judaism in late antiquity only to resurface in medieval Kabbalah. Idel suggests that the reverse was probably the case. Theosophic constructs emerged within Judaism during the century prior to the rise of Christianity, when Judaism was still in flux and the boundaries separating Jews from non-Jews were rather flexible. These theosophic constructs developed in two directions. On the one hand, they found their way to Gnostic circles, where theosophy was liberated from its original ritualistic import and fused with the new Christian soteriology. On the other hand, these ancient constructs were preserved in rabbinic Judaism by Jews who remained within the confines of rabbinic Judaism. Traces of them were left in the aggadic material of the Talmud and Midrash and received full ela- boration in medieval Kabbalah. Thus theosophic Kabbalah was not created by the intrusion of Gnosticism, but was rather an integral evolution of authentic Jewish traditions. Idel's attempt to de-Gnostify kabbalistic theosophy is not entirely revo- lutionary. Scholem himself noted that some Gnostic motifs-for example, the seventy-two forms (morphe)-that appear in Sefer ha-Bahir and in the Hekhalot literature in fact have a Jewish source.32 Idel substantiates this observation by utilizing recent developments in the field of Gnosticism (occasioned by the discovery of the Nag Hammadi library) which Scholem either did not or could not consult. Scholem's Gnostification of Kabbalah was more pronounced when he began to generalize about the relationship 32. See Gershom Scholem, Origins of the Kabbalah, ed. R. J. Zwi Werblowsky, trans. Allan Arkush (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1987), p. 79.</page><page sequence="25">CONTINUITY AND REVISION IN THE STUDY OF THE KABBALAH 185 between Kabbalah and myth; and it is this generalization which Idel correct- ly challenges.33 Idel does not pretend to have solved the complex relation- ship between Judaism and Gnosticism. He merely calls for close coopera- tion between scholars in the fields of Kabbalah and Gnosticism. Idel is aware that he has not yet established a direct, continuous link between the ancient and medieval sources; too many pieces of the puzzle are still missing. Ofttimes, Idel says "I assume" or "I conjecture" (e.g., pp. 115, 119, 131) when solid proof is not yet available. In other words, Idel offers no more and no less than a working hypothesis. Given the methodological difficulties of the reconstructionist method, Idel's hypothesis is fruitful if understood as a proposal to study kabbalistic literature against the background of rabbinic literature, especially in the aggadic material of the Talmud and Midrash. But this is not new; Scholem and several other scholars have already taken this route. Still, Idel's preliminary inquiries suggest that one can no longer take for granted Scholem's emphatic assertion: "the God of the book Bahir is not known to us from any other source of Jewish thought before the twelfth century."34 Especially intriguing is Idel's interpretation of the motif du-parSufim. Citing primarily Midrash Tadshe, Idel shows the existence of a pre- kabbalistic tradition which viewed the two divine attributes (Middat ha-Din and Middat ha-Rahamim), the components of the Tetragrammaton, and the two cherubim as male and female. Idel does not say that the mid- rash actually advocated a conception of a bisexual God as found in medie- val Kabbalah, but he suggests that the sexualization of divine attributes was "an important step toward the Kabbalistic conception" (p. 133). With respect to the conception of God, these midrashim undermine Scholem's rationalist notion that rabbinic Judaism endorsed pure monotheism. The sexual nature of the divine attributes suggests an anthropomorphic and dynamic conception of God. The inner life of God is governed by the rhythm of human sexuality: attraction and withdrawal, coming together and falling apart, marriage and divorce. The unity of God is thus a unity within 33. On Scholem's position concerning the relationship between Kabbalah and Gnosticism, consult Isaiah Tishby, "Upheaval in the Research of Kabbalah (On: M. Idel, Kabbalah: New Perspectives)" (in Hebrew), Zion 54 (1989): 209-222, and Idel's response, "What Is New Is Forbidden," ibid., pp. 223-240. 34. Gershom Scholem, Reshit ha-Qabbalah (Jerusalem: Schocken, 1948), p. 26; Origins of the Kabbalah, p. 66.</page><page sequence="26">186 HAVA TIROSH-ROTHSCHILD plurality, a coincidentia oppositorum, a unification of the masculine and feminine aspects of God (p. 133). Idel's discussion of the du-pargufim motif falls short of explaining the meaning of kabbalistic gender categories. For example, the masculine aspect of God-the right side of the Sefirotic constellation-is associated with compassion, nurturing, and lovingkindness (gender characteristics conven- tionally ascribed to females), whereas the feminine side of the Deity (the left side) is associated with stern judgment, jealous vindictiveness, harsh disci- pline, and dominion (gender stereotypes traditionally ascribed to males). It is the left side of the Deity from which evil, death, and the demonic spring forth. Furthermore, in kabbalistic theosophy a given Sefirah can act simul- taneously as masculine and feminine in respect to other Sefirot, and the entire upper nine Sefirot are considered as male in relation to the tenth, feminine Sefirah, the Shekhinah. So far, there is no systematic discussion that maps the employment of gender categories in kabbalistic exegesis. While Idel's discussion only begins to scratch the surface (see, for example, pp. 209, 227-232), he at least opens the door to an examination of Kabbalah in the light of recent gender studies and feminist scholarship. Idel's work provisionally challenges Scholem's contention about the absence of myth in halakhic Judaism. Scholem accurately identified the link between kabbalistic theosophy and myth, though he oversimplified the rela- tionship between Kabbalah and Halakhah. Scholem interpreted rabbinic conceptions of God as the conquest of ethical monotheism over pagan myth. The medieval Jewish philosophers merely systematized and forma- lized the initial monotheistic impulse.35 Accordingly, Scholem presented Kabbalah as "the revenge of the myth upon its conquerors." But since Scholem associated the mythical dimension of Kabbalah with Gnosticism, he regarded whatever is mythical in Kabbalah as an intrusion of "alien elements" into rabbinism.36 Idel dismisses Scholem's division between "a defeated mythical Gnosticism and a triumphant nonmythical rabbinism" (p. 156) as overly simplistic. He joins other scholars (Baer, Neusner, Yerushal- mi, and Schweid) who argue that Halakhah is not devoid of myth and that the very performance of misvot has a mythic dimension. The mythic dimen- 35. Scholem, Elements of the Kabbalah, pp. 92-93. 36. Ibid., p. 97.</page><page sequence="27">CONTINUITY AND REVISION IN THE STUDY OF THE KABBALAH 187 sion of Halakhah, according to Idel, is to be found in its theurgic interpreta- tion of the mipvot. In short, medieval Kabbalah only elaborated and embellished the theurgic-mythic dimension of Halakhah. Demonstrating the nexus between theosophy and theurgy is one of Idel's novel contributions to the interpretation of Kabbalah. Theosophy was not speculative knowledge for its own sake, but knowledge conducive to the activation of the Deity. To use Idel's analogy (which echoes Jonathan Z. Smith's work),37 theosophy functioned like a road map to the divine land- scape. Mastering the road map (that is, attaining theosophic knowledge) was but a means to another end-bringing about a change in the Godhead. More precisely, the theosophic kabbalist attempted to restore the Deity to its pristine perfection disrupted originally by the First Sin. Subsequent sins of Israel and the nations only perpetuate the broken, disharmonious exis- tence of the Deity symbolically represented by the separation of the mascu- line and feminine aspects of God. To restore the Godhead to its original perfection, the kabbalist had to unify the divine male and female symbolized as Sefirot Tiferet and Malkhut. If successful, the kabbalist added power to God which, in turn, could benefit the universe: divine efflux emanates from the Godhead and sustains the universe. Conversely, theurgic failure dimin- ishes the power of God and obstructs divine efflux from nourishing the uni- verse. The theurgic enterprise requires not only knowledge of the divine landscape (i.e., theosophy) but also specific mental energy-performance of mipvot with kavanah. For Idel, theurgy is the secret for the longevity and vitality of rabbinic Judaism. He avers: "It was precisely the theurgic view of the command- ments that was one of the factors that enforced the performance of the commandments, the lively interest in them, and the adherence of Jews to their rituals" (p. 171). In other words, while Idel does not say that all of Halakhah is mythical, he does say that the mythical import of Halakhah was essential to the success of the rabbinic program. Thus Idel argues (contra Scholem) that Halakhah was not an arid land waiting to be watered by the mythical water of Kabbalah, but rather that within Halakhah there was (along with other trends) a highly mythical, sexually charged trend whose 37.

Because theosophic Kabbalah only embellished the myth, it did not pose a threat to religious authority. And thus the theurgic and mythical dimension of Kabbalah explains both its conservative nature and the readiness of medieval Jews to accept Kabbalah as the authoritative interpretation of Judaism. Theosophy, theurgy, myth, and ritual converge in kabbalistic symbo- lism. Idel's interpretation of kabbalistic symbolism is much more sophisti- cated than the romanticist distinction between symbol and allegory adopted by Scholem. Idel argues that mysticism is not necessarily symbolic, and that kabbalistic symbolism is not necessarily mystical; in fact its major import is often theurgic. Abulafia, the main proponent of ecstatic Kabbalah, sharply distinguished between the human intellect and the imagination, and viewed the latter as an obstacle to the perfection of the former. Symbolism is a product of the imagination, and as such it is corporeally bound, imprecise, and prevents the attainment of pure knowledge, i.e., of union of the human intellect with the semi-divine Active Intellect. Abulafia rejected symbolism and instead his mysticism of language was based on the numerical values of Hebrew letters and his Maimonidean worldview. In theosophic Kabbalah, on the other hand, "the basic unit was not the monadic letter, freed of its link to the canonic text, but the word which remained generally intact while its esoteric meaning alluded to a divine hypostasis" (p. 208). Thus while words retained their literal meaning, the sentence in toto was understood to symbolize an internal process within the Godhead. Idel insightfully explains that this linguistic difference accounts for the social differences between ecstatic Kabbalah and theosophic Kabbalah. The former was highly indivi- dualistic and esoteric, open to but the few initiates, while the latter was con- sonant with the communal nature of halakhic Judaism. Because theosophic Kabbalah retained the literal meaning of canonic texts (while endowing them with symbolic meanings), it preserved the communal structure of traditional Jewish society. Idel's sensitive analysis of kabbalistic hermeneutics does not claim to present a comprehensive theory of kabbalistic symbolism. Indeed, Idel con- siders such theory "a kind of hubris" (p. 233). We still do not know how kabbalistic symbols "work," or "how to do things with kabbalistic symbols," to paraphrase J. L. Austin. Idel could not possibly have proposed such a theory because the raw data for this project have not yet been pro- cessed. Essential to this project are the dozens of anonymous Commentaries on the Ten Sefirot which functioned as "dictionaries" of kabbalistic</page><page sequence="29">CONTINUITY AND REVISION IN THE STUDY OF THE KABBALAH 189 language.38 Idel, of course, is thoroughly familiar with this material, which he insightfully compares to the lists of bestiaries and lapidaries used by Christian scholars to decipher biblical symbolism (p. 213). To articulate a comprehensive theory of language on the basis of these texts as well as the rest of the extensive kabbalistic corpus is a huge project which requires pro- ficiency in philosophy of language, semiotics, and hermeneutics. As Idel encourages scholars to embark on this project, he reminds them that in the final analysis "a kabbalistic symbol invited one to act rather than to think" (p. 223). IV In the concluding chapter of Kabbalah: New Perspectives, Idel shifts the focus from the phenomenology of Kabbalah to the role Kabbalah has played in Jewish history. Several assertions in this chapter have aroused the ire of some critics, who isolate them from Idel's phenomenological analysis in the preceding chapters. Perhaps this indicates the underlying method- ological difficulty of a book that tries to combine phenomenology and his- tory of ideas. As it stands, the chapter treats several complex issues without sufficient depth, either due to limited space or because Idel has dealt with them elsewhere. In principle Idel endorses Scholem's view that Kabbalah was a major force in Jewish history. In his view, it is simply impossible to understand the Jewish experience without paying close attention to Kabbalah. The differ- ence between Scholem and Idel is that Idel denies that Kabbalah dialectical- ly overcame the deficiencies of rabbinic Judaism. Rather, Idel holds that Kabbalah shaped Jewish rituals, sexual mores, education, and life style pre- cisely because it had "deep affinity with certain rabbinic patterns of thought" (p. 252). This affinity accounts for the limited opposition to Kab- balah, as well as to its relative success as an historical movement. On the emergence of Kabbalah as an historical force, Idel's position is somewhere between Graetz's and Scholem's. Idel upholds Graetz's initial 38. A partial list of these commentaries was published by Scholem, "Index to Commen- taries on Ten Sefirot" (in Hebrew), Kiryat Sefer 10 (1934): 498-515. I understand from Idel that he has compiled a much larger list for private use as a research tool.</page><page sequence="30">190 HAVA TIROSH-ROTHSCHILD observation that Kabbalah emerged as a response to philosophic rational- ism, but he agrees with Scholem that the two movements were not antitheti- cal but interdependent. In particular, the ecstatic-unitive trend in Kabbalah borrowed and gave a new twist to concepts and religious ideals from medie- val philosophy. Idel shows that the interplay between Kabbalah and philo- sophy was particularly strong in Italy during the late fifteenth century, where Kabbalah was perceived as an ancient and esoteric philosophic lore conducive to the attainment of mystical and magical ends. Idel's innovative analysis of Yohanan Alemanno shows the impact of Kabbalah on Renais- sance culture. This leads to the conclusion that Kabbalah was important not only in Judaism by also in the formation of Europe's majority culture. Idel's insistence on the indebtedness of Christianity to Jews and Judaism reveals his own (most likely unconscious) particularist bias. No less ardent a Zionist than Scholem, Idel attempts to liberate the study of Kabbalah from the political task Scholem assigned to it in Zionist renewal. For Idel, Zionism is not an ideology in need of justification but an existential, self- authenticating truth experienced by a refugee from Communist Romania. But Idel is not free (neither can one expect him to be) from the particularist tendencies of Zionist historiography. This is but another proof that Gadamer (with whom Idel concurs) is apparently right when he says that we are always children of a given tradition. If knowledge is historically situated, as Idel maintains in his critique of Scholem, so is Idel's own interpretation of Kabbalah. Notwithstanding the importance of Kabbalah, Idel challenges Scholem's famous reconstruction of it as the force which stood at the center of the dialectical process that ushered modernity into Jewish history. Scholem maintained that Lurianic Kabbalah emerged as a response to the trauma of the expulsion from Spain. The expulsion accentuated the tragedy of Israel's exile, but Lurianic Kabbalah endowed it with new meaning: the travails of Israel's exile reflect God's own exile in the act of Simpum and the subsequent crisis of shevirah. Concomitantly, Lurianic Kabbalah offered a messianic message of hope: through the performance of miSvot Israel will restore the broken Deity and hasten the coming of the Messiah. Thus Lurianic Kab- balah not only endowed the expulsion from Spain with metaphysical mean- ing; it also placed the burden of ushering in the Messiah on each and every Jew. Idel challenges this reconstruction on several grounds. First, there is no proof that Luria himself viewed the expulsion from Spain as a traumatic, tragic event. It is not self-evident that Luria experienced the psychological</page><page sequence="31">CONTINUITY AND REVISION IN THE STUDY OF THE KABBALAH 191 crisis which the expulsion caused Sephardic Jews who underwent it. Luria's extant writings indicate that he viewed the expulsion and the influx of Jewish immigrants to the Holy Land as a positive sign of providential activity. Second, the theological principles of SimSum, shevirah, and tiqqun were not Lurianic innovations but elaborations of existing theosophic-theurgic con- structs. Third, "to the extent that Lurianic Kabbalah had a messianic message, it was not greater than the messianic burden of earlier Kabbalah" (p. 258). The theurgic underpinning of Kabbalah always assigned human activity a restorative task. According to both Zoharic and Lurianic Kab- balah, the Messiah will come as a result of preparatory human actions rather than as a sudden eruption of the eschaton in the world. Lurianic Kab- balah thus was not an innovative response to cataclysmic crisis, but an extension of existing trends in Kabbalah. By the same token, Idel revises Scholem's reconstruction of the tie between Lurianism and Sabbatianism. According to Scholem, the messianic import of Lurianism makes understandable its dissemination as a mass movement prior to the activities of Sabbatai Zevi. Idel holds that this recon- struction is not borne out by the extant primary sources. Lurianic Kabbalah did not infiltrate the masses; in fact, it retreated from exotericism to esoteri- cism. Not only did the disciples of Luria agree among themselves not to spread the teachings of their master (as Scholem himself discovered), but the kind of Lurianic Kabbalah which did become public was non-messianic. For instance, the version of Lurianic Kabbalah which was spread in Italy by Israel Sarug gave Luria's theosophy a Neoplatonic philosophic twist. To the extent that Kabbalah spread at all in Italy, it had little to do with the alleged messianism of Lurianic Kabbalah and more with the particular intellectual bent of sixteenth-century Italian Jewish intellectuals. Furthermore, the few Italian kabbalists who incorporated Lurianic Kabbalah in their works were far from creating a mass movement (p. 258). Idel concludes, "Lurianism and Sabbatianism displayed opposing versions of messianism, which could not easily be reconciled" (p. 259). While the former asserted that only the restor- ative activities of Israel bring the Messiah, Sabbatianism claimed that Zevi's redemptive actions by themselves had already ushered in the eschaton. Idel justly calls on scholars to reexamine the causes of Sabbatianism rather than accept Scholem's historical reconstruction as axiomatic truth. In conclusion, Kabbalah: New Persepctive offers a thoughtful, well- documented, and provocative reinterpretation of Kabbalah. The Kabbalah that emerges from this reinterpretation is not a speculative system but a</page><page sequence="32">192 HAVA TIROSH-ROTHSCHILD complex religious phenomenon whose core is experiential, mystical and theurgic. Idel advises us that Kabbalah should be viewed as an integral extension of rabbinic Judaism, indeed as an elaboration of ancient Jewish esoteric traditions and mental structures. In doing so, Idel sheds new light not only on Kabbalah but also on rabbinic Judaism. Both appear in his reconstruction as more mythical, sexual, irrational, occultist, particularistic, and theurgic than previously thought. But to prove his views, Idel must employ the rigorous scholarly standards championed first by Wissenschaft scholarship, as did Scholem before him. Thus both Scholem and Idel exem- plify the dialectic of continuity and revision in Jewish scholarship. Indiana University Bloomington, In.</page></plain_text>
