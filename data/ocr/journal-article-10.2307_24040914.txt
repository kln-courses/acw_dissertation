<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Natural Heart: Jane Eyre's Romanticism By Richard J. Dunn University of Washington In discussing Romantic fiction we have been often unable to distinguish between the Romantic trappings of a basically realistic work and more sus tained Romanticism. But theorists of the novel are now recognizing the in herent Romanticism of the novel form and are beginning to consider the onto logical and teleological implications of fictions that engage in sustained play between their empirical and Romantic impulses. 1 Robert Kiely acknowl edges this formal tension when he concludes his fine study, The Romantic Novel in England (1972), with the insight that Wuthering Heights extends "the pos sibilities of intuition, subjectivity, or lyricism . . . without losing the old-fashioned outlines of the form altogether" (p. 255). But in declaring Wuthering Heights as the most representative formal encounter between Roman ticism and the realistic novel, he omits Jane Eyre because he thinks that "its stress on morality and education, looks to the great themes of Victorian fiction" (p. viii). In terms of formal structure he probably is right. The moralizing first-person narration, the social satire, the use of marriage as a convention of the happy ending, the rational accounting for many strange events--all seem to fall into the format of realistic fiction. Attempts to understand the Romanticism of Jane Eyre have taken two general directions. Robert B. Heilman has searched the text for moments of the "new Gothic," places where Charlotte Brontë uses the old convention for psychological study ("Charlotte Bronte's 'New' Gothic," From Jane Austen to Joseph Conrad, ed. R. Rathburn and M. Steinmann [1958], pp. 118-32). Ruth B. Yeazell has made the more sweeping claim that "like all romantic literature, Jane Eyre is part dream, but this dream has integrity, coherence, and a logic of its own" ("More True than Real: Jane Eyre's 'Mysterious Summons'," NCF, 29 [1974], 128). Her study of the climactic mysterious call does much to define Jane Eyre as a Romantic fiction, a novel with "a vision which . . . dialectically unites independence and love and creates a world whose outward design mirrors the internal progress of the psyche" (p. 129). But in concen trating on the fulfillment of Jane's vision, this reading does not place the mysterious summons in the full context of the frequent testing in the novel of the extent to which mind and nature are commensurate. It is more in the search after vision than in any realized vision that Jane Eyre derives its power as a Romantic statement. The final call, however desperate as psychic necessity or as mere plot device, comes as the paradoxically inexplicable climax to visionary searching that Jane can in retrospect explain rather fully only up to that point. Like many great Romantic poems and novels, Jane Eyre concludes with an incommunicable awareness; what Jane learns is not that there is any definite answer to natural mysteries but rather that imaginative power may be confirmed in a moment of vision. Her conclusions about her experience, then, like many of Wordsworth's, remain strong impressions of how things "seem to exist to the senses, and to the passions" (Prose Works of William Wordsworth, ed. W. J. B. Owen and J. W. Smyser [1974], III, 63). Jane's fictional autobiography, attending to a broadly symbolic progress from Gateshead to Lowood to Thornfield to Moor House and concluding at Ferndean, is a journey with stages marked by her growing awareness of the problematic relationship of human nature and the natural world. Cramped imaginatively in 197</page><page sequence="2">each of these settings before the final one, but beginning to locate natural sympathies at Moor House, Jane, less self-consciously than Coleridge, attempts to make nature "the term in which we comprehend all things that are representa ble in forms of time and space" (Aids to Reflection, quoted in Owen Barfield, What Coleridge Thought [1971], p. 185). For her, as for those Romantic writers Frederick Garber categorizes as egotistic, empathetic, or ironic, there is no easy synthesis of self and nature. As Garber says, "Consciousness and nature . . . can be antagonists as well as partners, and sometimes both at once" ("Nature and the Romantic Mind: Egotism, Empathy, Irony," CL, 29 [1977], 194). Jane Eyre often displays an antagonism between consciousness and nature. It opens with scenes of enclosure, both literal and figurative, in which conscious acts are limited to scanning books, peering into mirrors, sketching landscapes from a limiting schoolroom perspective. As Jane moves outward, literally improving her outlook, her consciousness ironically deceives her and she momentarily surrenders to Rochester's powers. Finally distancing herself from him and finding her concepts of herself and of human nature challenged by the fierce doctrines of St. John Rivers, she defines her nature in terms of space, time, and final awesome silence. Rather than discovering any certain harmony between the individual psyche and the world, Jane Eyre ends with an attitude similar to Carlyle's when he described the "sphinx riddle" of nature. There is in nature, he wrote in Past and Present, "a celestial beauty,—which means celestial order, pliancy to wisdom; but there is also a darkness, a ferocity, fatality, which are infernal" (ed. R. Altick [1965], p. 13). Strain though she may toward some ultimate celestial order, Jane, in describing her return to Rochester, writes as someone informed by a Romantic awareness of the natural sphinx riddle. Even as she finds her imaginative powers confirmed, she grows aware that vision is more easily intuited than expressed. The culmination of this imaginative effort begins with the account of the mysterious call Jane receives from Rochester. She insists it is no supernatural phenomenon but nature at its best, and she ultimately considers some of its circumstances "too awful and inexplicable to be discussed" (Jane Eyre, ed. R. J. Dunn [1971], chap. 35). But although she acknowledges this essential mystery of the power of nature, she realizes this event is the immediate source of great personal power. She says that this is her time "to assume ascendancy. My powers were in play and in force" (chap. 35). There may be some confusion about what powers and what ascendancy she gains. Her immediate return to Rochester and her support of him in his suffering would suggest that the power is of one person over another, neatly reversing the dominance he earlier had over her. Her ascendancy, however, seems to be more that of imaginative power than of will power. The distinction is evident when (in language that shows Charlotte Bronte's characteristic fusing of imaginative and religious faith) Jane utters her thanksgiving for the vision. She tells us that she "prayed in my way" and thought her thanks "effective in its own fashion," for she now feels able "to penetrate very near a Mighty Spirit" (chap. 35). Though her understanding is couched in vague Christian terms, Jane acknowledges an imaginative power like that described by Wordsworth in "Tintern Abbey": "A presence that disturbs me with the joy/ Of elevated thoughts" (11. 94-95). Jane returns to Rochester, but the implicit result of her new realization is the writing of the book that recollects the course of her earlier, less rewarding searchings for visionary power. The first view we get of Jane is one she recalls as a sense of being "shrined in double retirement" (chap. 1). Shut away in the Gateshead window 198</page><page sequence="3">seat, fascinated by Bewick's history of British birds, she is suspended be tween the life of the house and the chilly garden but is stimulated imagina tively by the naturalist's scenes of desolation and icy grandeur. Soon punished and sent to the infernal red room, Jane views herself in a mirror as "one of the tiny phantoms, half fairy, half imp" that "stories represented as coming up out of low, fiery dells in moors, and appearing before the eyes of belated travellers" (chap. 2). This impression foreshadows Rochester's later treatment of her as an elfin creature, and the envisioned encounter with the belated traveller anticipates the first meeting she has with him. But at this early stage it is Jane who tentatively describes herself as an emanation from the moors; under the moral commandment of unyielding guardians she wonders whether she is fairy or demon, natural or unnatural. When she denounces her aunt, she drops her storybook indirection and says that "a ridge of lighted heath, alive, glancing, devouring, would have been a meet emblem of my mind" (chap. 4). Here her metaphors pick up a Carlylean energy, establishing a vital relationship between consciousness and nature. But the energy is not sustained; within an hour she realizes "the same ridge, black and blasted after the flames are dead would have represented as meetly my subsequent condition" (chap. 4). More concerned about how to act than how to think about her own nature, just before leaving Gateshead Jane stares across an empty field and finds little comfort from the scene where "black frost reigned, unbroken by sun or breeze." Plaintively she whispers, "What shall I do?—What shall I do?" (chap. 4). Ironically, her plea is answered by the servant's calling her to lunch; but we should pause to contrast this moment of longing with a far greater moment in Romantic literature, Shelley's "Mont Blanc." There, with a sublime object in sight, silence and solitude are not vacant, and the poem describes the process of a human mind rendering and receiving "fast influencings" as it holds "unremitting interchange/ With the clear universe of things around" (11. 38-40). But Jane, at this stage insecure in any sense of herself as an entirely natural being, afraid of the fiery and supernatural potential of nature, cannot yet find the sustenance Shelley's speaker does in "the secret strength of things/ Which governs thought" (11. 139-40). For her the question remains the practical one of what she is to do when she leaves Gateshead. For the next eight years, though, at Lowood, the question is more one of what is done to her. With its walled garden and gravelike plots for the girls to tend, the school operates on the premise that people must not conform to nature. Even naturally curly hair is quickly clipped, and patient sufferers such as Helen Burns can look only to heaven (and such consolatory reading as Rasselas) for relief. Jane, however, tells us that she continued to gaze longingly at the hills beyond the school and fostered a general awareness of the puzzling contradiction between a seemingly pleasant external world and the many sickbeds in the school. Finally able to move forward on her own, Jane begins at Thornfield with "the promise of a smooth career." But soon she grows restless and paces the corridor of the third story, "safe in the silence and solitude of the spot." There she permits her "mind's eye to dwell on whatever bright visions rose before it" and opens her "inward ear to a tale that was never ended," created by imagination and "quickened with all of incident, life, fire, feeling that I desired and had not in my actual existence" (chap. 12). The searching be comes even more intense as she climbs to the roof and looks "out afar over 199</page><page sequence="4">sequestered field and hill," wishing "for a power of vision that might over pass that limit" (chap. 12). This longing differs from her earlier moment at Gateshead because she is now aware that she lacks vision, not just practical direction. Given the increasing intensity of this longing, her imagination may mis interpret incidents in her new life at Thornfield, and that her first meeting with Rochester involves a characteristic mixture of imaginative distortion and mundane response. The meeting comes in an inauspicious place, at a late hour in the day. Jane once more finds herself alone in a cold, darkening environ ment, but because she has been walking vigorously she does not mind the cold. The noise of an approaching horse suddenly causes her imagination to transform a scene in which she had been finding the "best winter delight ... in its utter solitude and leafless repose." The approaching hoofbeats interrupt this quiet and she fearfully imagines another kind of landscape, a gothically sublime one. She thinks at once of a picture in which "the solid mass of a crag or the rough boles of a great oak, drawn in dark and strong in the fore ground, efface the aerial distance of azure hill, sunny horizon" (chap. 12). The anticipation of a human presence, of a being yet unknown to her, further affects her pictorial imagination. The terrifying shift of perspective from "aerial distance" to massive foreground object resembles Wordsworth's recollec tion of the huge peak uprearing its head to interpose itself between him and the stars. In both instances the anthropomorphism is telling because it signals the imaginative apprehension of a nature possessing an active life of its own. In Jane's case the sense of the impending human presence as a great tree imagistically anticipates her later associations of Rochester with the massive Thornfield chestnut (an obviously sexual association 2), and the fact that he becomes the massive foreground object of her imagination foreshadows the greater impositions he is to make upon her outreaching imagination. At the first meeting Jane's understanding of her own nature is yet tenta tive, flitting between actuality and fearful anticipation colored by her remembrance of childhood stories, for as the horse approaches she thinks also back to the stories of the Gytrash, "a North-of-England spirit" that haunted solitary places. As Jane says, she still "was young, and all sorts of fan cies, bright and dark, tenanted my mind" (chap. 12). The actual meeting, in which she helps Rochester back to his horse after a slip on the ice, is a mundane contrast to these imaginings. But in terms of what is to come, the incident is both ominous and auspicious — ominous because it displays Jane's capacity for misunderstanding and her readiness for being awed by Rochester; auspicious because in helping him it shows her able to act sensibly when required. The series of paintings Jane brought from Lowood and shows to Rochester soon after they meet provides yet another version of her imaginative longing to stretch natural spatial boundaries, and they also obviously once more re flect her sense of chilly solitude broken only by vaguely human powers. Commentators have found subconscious implications in these paintings (see especially, T. A. Langford, "Prophetic Imagination and the Unity of Jane Eyre," SNNTS, 6 [1974], 228-35), but more simply, how they confirm what the novel has been showing about Jane's efforts to relate mind to nature. The paintings are a collective attempt to find relationship in this period when imaginatively as much as socially Jane is uncertain of her place. Thus it is appropriate that the paintings strive toward spaciousness and a grandeur whose source Jane 200</page><page sequence="5">seems to realize only in her mind. The subjects of these landscapes are not the "sequestered field and hill" that surround such houses as Thornfield. The first painting is a seascape, and the primary feature is that "all the dis tance is in eclipse." The second picture presents only the dim peak of a hill and the image of a woman rising into the sky, and although there is no human subject in the third painting, it too includes a rising action because of its focus on the pinnacle of an iceberg piercing a polar sky (chap. 13). As in her early imagining of herself as a creature from the fiery heath, Jane in painting the life of nature cannot yet be clear in comprehending its signif icance to her human nature. That she presents these paintings for Rochester's inspection opens her nature to his view and eases the turn of narrative atten tion to his accounts of himself. Rochester begins extensive rationalizings about his conduct with the com ment that "Nature meant me to be a good man" (chap. 14). Explaining his past, he claims that his failings are more those of dissipation than debauchery, and in so doing establishes a sense of himself as natural man, because dissipation is the misconduct of a lapsed rather than unnatural or inherently evil being. Jane, faced with the presence of his illegitimate daughter and haughty friends, may wince at such arguments, yet from the outset she feels attracted to him. Cynically, readers may account for this by regarding him as the supreme ra tionalizer who wins the admiration of a yet to be successful rebel, but in view of Jane's earlier experience it is important to notice that he provides the exact encouragement she most needs. In his self-justification and through his approval of her as free spirit, he suggests to her that if she seems different from other people, it is the most favorable work of nature. Presenting himself in this fashion, he counteracts the cumulative force of the various persecutors who had treated Jane as fiendishly unnatural. More over, Rochester's claims to naturalness seem valid because he opposes the right things; he criticizes the cramping morality of Lowood, and in his fortunetelling game, turns upsidedown artificial class-consciousness. But the sour note sounds in his self-interest. It comes forth pathetically as he explains his fascination with little Adele, telling Jane he had once been green, "ay, grass green: not a more vernal tint freshens you now than once freshened me." But left with his "French floweret" after his spring has gone, he says he keeps the child in the hope of "expiating numerous sins, great or small, by one good work" (chap. 14). When we learn the terms under which he also keeps his mad wife, and the way he uses Blanche Ingram as a pawn in his courtship of Jane, we can hardly take these pious hopes seriously. But the best index to his character, showing the fallacious quality of his claims as "natural man," may be found in the way he regards Jane. He praises her naturalness, finds her a refreshing contrast to the other friends he brings to Thornfield, yet plays with her as something out of another world. And she, who once had trembled at a supernaturally suggestive mirror image of herself and who had first feared him as a supernatural force, willingly becomes his fairy imp, his birdlike sprite. Later she says she had erred in making him her God, and her moralizing retrospect may obscure the immediate personal issue. In the terms of Wuthering Heights the danger is that he will become more herself than she is, that she will submit her being totally to him. Much later, when the true marriage occurs, Jane will find that the chastened Rochester will suit the "finest fibre of my nature," but at this point neither rightly perceives the other's nature. He projects her into a fairy-story existence and she projects her spiritual being into him, declaring he had become her entire world. Thus the potentially bigamous marriage is a viola 201</page><page sequence="6">tion not simply of social and religious but also of natural law, for it would have linked two beings untrue to themselves and ignorant of their own natures. The falsity of this situation is evident long before the melodramatic interruption at the altar. Bertha, the night creature of his dark past, sets a fire in his bedroom, and Jane, claiming "natural sympathy with him," rushes to the rescue. His first response is curious, for he wakes to ask, "'In the name of all the elves in Christendom, is that Jane Eyre? . . . What have you done with me, witch, sorceress?1" (chap. 15). These are epithets he might better direct at the witch who set the fire, but to avoid the reality of her mad vengeance, he tries to convince his elfish Jane that he really is the victim of supernatural trickery. As he so deliberately distorts realities, Jane tries to find "signs, presentiments, and sympathies" to guide her ac tions. Though she takes these seriously, it is wrong to assume that she ever becomes able to interpret them fully. At the opening of chapter 21 it is the retrospective voice that remarks, "Presentiments are strange things', and so are sympathies; and so are signs: and the three combined make one mystery to which humanity has not yet found the key." She goes on to acknowledge how seriously she has regarded presentiments, testifies to a belief in sympathies, and concludes that "signs, for aught we know [my emphasis], may be but the sympathies of Nature with man." Here, more explicitly than anywhere in her autobiography, Jane acknowledges the mysteriousness of nature and the un certainty of human understanding, even as she asserts her imaginative faith. The contrast between this retrospective reflection and the action she is narrating at this point is strong. Because she is now so emotionally involved with Rochester, she finds it increasingly difficult to perceive and act ac cording to any but his guidance. She seems particularly unable to read signs of nature and instead projects her own mood upon the world around her. When lightning, a grimly gothic portent of punishment upon Rochester, strikes the old chestnut tree, she is momentarily awed. But the very next morning she bounds down the stairs proclaiming, "Nature must be gladsome when I am so happy" (chap. 24). Hers is the mistake of pathetically fallacious sentimental ist. Before the final union with Rochester can take place, she must rediscover the less explicable sympathies of nature and must learn not to oversimplify so the relationship between human and nonhuman nature. The account of her turmoil immediately following the interrupted wedding contains a number of metaphoric references to external nature that convey the confusion of her mind. The old chilling sensations return; she feels as though "a Christmas frost had come at midsummer," and imaginatively she cata pults backward from her simplistic association with the gladsome June. In deepening despair, she cries out with the Psalmist: "'the waters came into my soul; I sank in a deep mire: I felt no standing; I came into deep waters; the floods overflowed me'" (chap. 26). Imagistically there is much more personal involvement than in her earlier references to nature. No longer the passive onlooker or the visionary of potential action, she finds herself directly affected as subject and not artist of the power of nature. When she first leaves Thornfield she looks "neither to rising sun, nor smiling sky, nor wakened nature," but once free of the immediate surroundings, she declares, "I have no relative but the universal mother, Nature: I will seek her breast and ask repose" (chaps. 27, 28). This is the most sentimental of cliches (echoed by a desolate David Copperfield in the Alps), but the discovery of actual relatives soon moots the question of how universally benign nature may be. 202</page><page sequence="7">Among these relatives, St. John Rivers and his sisters, the final test of Jane's independent nature takes place. With Rochester she had been nearly overwhelmed by his ego that too willingly rationalized itself as natural, but with St. John she is nearly convinced of the necessity to exercise human control over merely natural inclination. Rochester and her cousin represent different extremes, but both articulate notions of nature for self-justifica tion, and both nearly persuade Jane of the rightness of their ideas. Although he claims that "natural affection only, of all the sentiments has permanent power over" him, St. John sets out deliberately "to turn the bent of nature." He thinks religion has turned his "original materials to the best account; pruning and training nature." A tormented man, he (somewhat like one of Hawthorne's demented thinkers) grants that religion cannot "eradicate nature: nor will it be eradicated 'till this mortal part put on immortality'" (chap. 32). His distinctions about pruning and training nature may seem absurd, but they come to Jane as the final challenges to her selfhood, and, in ironic re versal of his intended effect, cause her to best understand herself. On the surface her rejection of his proposal that she commit her life to his mis sionary work is a reasoned decision, an assertion of mind over her natural inclinations to admire his work. Were she to join him she would yield her being, submit to the moment's impulse; she acknowledges the temptation "to cease struggling with him--to rush down the torrent of his will into the gulf of his existence, and there lose my own." The seriousness of this threat is stronger than when love for Rochester had nearly eclipsed her "hope of Heaven." "Religion called--Angels beckoned--God commanded—life rolled to gether like a scroll—death's gates opening, showed eternity beyond: it seemed that for safety and bliss there, all here might be sacrificed in a second. The dim room was full of visions" (and of memories of Helen Burns, perhaps). We should note that these are indoor visions, couched in the language of Revelation. The good Christian may gladly sacrifice all existence because of an apocalyptic vision, but Jane the more independent romantic is not comfortable with these pious abstractions. In contrast to such impera tives as the calling of Religion and Angels' beckoning, it is a more "inward dimness of vision, before which clouds roll" that she heeds. When the call from Rochester comes from many miles away she does not regard it as the com manding of God. Finally the vision that comes comes as a voice; in Wordsworth's phrase Jane finds that a "visionary power/ Attends the motions of the viewless winds/ Embodied in the mystery of words" (Prelude [1850 text], V, 595-97). But whatever association we may care to make between this and other descrip tions of romantic visions, it is important to remember that the words she hears are simply her own name, "'Jane! Jane'. Jane!' nothing more" (chap. 35). She hears these from the recognizable voice of Rochester, crying in pain and woe. This settles her first question, "'Oh, God, what is it?'" for it obviously is not God. And to discount superstition, deception, or witchcraft, she sees this as "'the work of nature. She was roused and did—no miracle—but her best'" (chap. 35). The explanation not only avoids the fact that it was Jane herself who was strongly roused to seek an alternative to St. John's vision of Christian martyrdom but also begs the question of nature's own powers. Newfound friends, a fortunate inheritance, and a pleasant teaching situation have already given her new comforts; up to this point her one-time intention of throwing herself upon nature has not been rewarding. But also up to now her rewards (as are many rewards for fictional heroines) have been external; the acceptance of the mysterious call comes as a deeper affirmation of her intuition and as an act 203</page><page sequence="8">of self-confidence. However literally she tries to regard it, the call that allows her "to assume ascendancy" assures her that nature awfully apprehended is at least sometimes the medium for communication between mutually sympathetic souls. But the primary assurance must remain personal, because as the call neither commands nor begs her to come (though she so interprets it) the confir mation is simply that she must act according to the promptings of her imagina tion. As a result of her self-confidence, the reunion with Rochester comes in striking contrast to the cold scene where she first met him. She now moves along a "grass-green track" and descends a "forest-aisle" in the darkening "sylvan dusk." The first question he puts to her is appropriate; earlier he had playfully dehumanized her into sprite or elf, but now he asks, '"You are altogether a human being, Jane?"' It falls upon her to convince him, scarred as he is, that he is still human. She insists he is yet "green and vigorous," and he soon asks whether he suits her. The brief but immediate reply, "'To the fullest fibre of my nature, sir,'" resounds with self-confidence. One further detail of their relationship helps us to realize that this is not false confidence, yet ready to cause Jane to imagine June mornings from Sep tember scenes. When she learns that he had heard her reply to his distant call, she considers the coincidence "too awful and inexplicable to be dis cussed." Once more she deliberately rejects the "deeper shade of the super natural," and from both him and her audience keeps "these things then, and ponder[s] them in my heart" (chap. 37). Despite the tasteless echo of the Annunciation that must have bothered readers ready to damn her work as "an anti-Christian composition" ( Quarterly Review, 84 [1848], 173], this is a particularly Romantic annunciation, for it testifies to the capacity of vision and not the substance of it. Finding that another has participated in awful experience suggests to us, if not to her, that she has earned her place as one of those poets who speak of strange things that at least in theory can be shared. The ground of Jane's natural affection for her husband remains in explicable, even to her, and if we can survive the grandiloquence of the final testimonial to another kind of devotion--St. John's--we may sense that for all this wordiness, Jane "knows" more than she chooses to tell. To return to this novel with attention to her telling of her progress toward this intui tive security is to recognize how fully hers is a Romantic imagination. So regarded, her "autobiography" traces the movement of her imagination from tentative self-questioning and longing for visionary experience toward a secure sense of imaginative powers confirmed by a vision she keeps private, probably because, for aught she knows, nature remains "a mystery to which humanity has not yet found the key."
