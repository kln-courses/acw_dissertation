<plain_text><page sequence="1">Correspondence Trees â€” An Exchange To the Editors: In their article, "Trees, Forestry, and the Responsiveness of Creation" (Cross Currents, Summer 1994), Walsh, Karsh, and Ansell wax eloquent about the need to relate to a tree as a Thou rather than an It. The authors concede near the end of the article that their views cannot be considered scientific, to which I could only respond, "No kidding, you could have fooled me." What bothers me is not that their conclusions are not scientifically supportable, but that they exemplify such a wretched form of philosophizing, even cracker-barrel philosophy. The authors eschew the need to argue for their conclusions, since, they say, they are content to argue from them. Their view is merely prescientific, they say, and as such falls within the tacit dimension to which Polanyi referred. This location apparently frees them from any obligation to avoid fallacies in their reasoning, use terms with reasonable precision and clarity of meaning, and give at least modest philosophical support for their worldview. They do in fact sometimes argue for their point of view, but when they do so they seem to commit the fallacy of false alternatives. Apparently they think that the only way to avoid rationalism (which is apparently a totally pejora tive term for them) and mechanism is to ascribe selfhood, subjectivity, will, motivation, and agency to trees. In fact, no two philosophers are more op posed to mechanism and rationalism (in any pejorative sense) than Whitehead and Hartshorne. Whitehead is apparently a panpsychist or psychicalist and Hartshorne undoubtedly so. Both stress the reality of creativity and respon siveness in every actual entity (the ultimate units of feeling in process which make up the universe). But neither would interpret trees in this way. Trees, and plants in general, are colonies of cells, democratically organized and lacking that dominant sequence of occasions of feeling that animals and humans have and which is essential for selfhood, subjectivity, will, motivation, or agency. Why do Whitehead and Hartshorne deny these capacities to trees? Because there is no evidence that they have them or, for that matter, that trees as such (as opposed to their constituent cells and actual entities) are sentient. In con trast, our three authors, in spite of assuring us that they know the difference between metaphor and literal truth, rely entirely upon metaphor to establish what is apparently to be taken as literally true. Occasionally they cite evidence, 560 CROSS CURRENTS</page><page sequence="2">but it is evidence that is irrelevant or inadequate for their conclusion. They seem to think, for example, that if there is evidence for intrinsic finality in the behavior of trees, that must also establish selfhood, volition, and agency. Once again they leap from the rejection of mechanism (hardly an original view these days) all the way to what appears to be a crudely animistic and sentimental view of trees. If this type of worldview has any merit, then it deserves to be argued for in an intellectually responsible manner and not merely by touchy-feely enthu siasm. If this article were meant as a poem, I would say that Joyce Kilmer did it better, and less pretentiously. More plausibly, I am afraid, it could be inter preted as a parody of the worst of ecotheology. Gary Bedell Kansas City, Mo. To the Editors: The Summer 1994 article by Brian J. Walsh, Marianne B. Karsh, and Nik Ansell, treating trees as responsive creatures with whom we as fellow-creatures can enter into intersubjective relationships, evokes a number of reactions in me. Like others, I suppose, I have had moments in which such a relationship seemed quite plausible, and moments when it seemed simply goofy. The article offers a new perspective from which to reflect on such moments. The authors' claim that trees, in their own fashion, respond to their Creator with both longing and praise calls to mind Gerard Manley Hopkins's sense of the "inscape" of created things. The "dearest freshness deep down things" certainly sounds like another way of speaking of the "thou" of a tree or other creature. Perhaps Hopkins offers elements of a theological and aesthetic frame work within which to discuss such concepts. Thomas Merton, in New Seeds of Contemplation, took this same insight to mean that the nonhuman orders praise God simply by being what they are: the tree lifting its branches, the colt moving in just this way, are being themselves, and in being themselves praise their Creator. Indeed, the shapes of trees sometimes seem to suggest attitudes of praise or devotion. If what Walsh, Karsh, and Ansell propose has any validity, then perhaps these perceptions have more to them than merely the projection of human responses onto dumb objects. As far as the article's biblical grounding is concerned, it is certainly true that the main emphasis of the Bible is on the relation of God's people to their covenant God. However, the authors are right to draw attention to the worldview within which this emphasis is framed as something other than the objectified and mechanistic one in which we have been educated. Besides the examples they note, praise by the creatures appears most notably in Psalms 98; 103:20-22; 114; 148; there are references to all creatures praising God scattered here and there elsewhere as well. Most comprehensive and most beautiful WINTER 1994-95 561</page><page sequence="3">of all, perhaps, is the apocryphal Song of the Three Young Men in the Sep tuagint version of Daniel. Its excerpting in some Christian traditions as the canticle Benedicite, omnia opera Domini offers a powerful liturgical resource for reflection on this theme. Indeed, we who use the Doxology common in many churches might want to think about what we mean when we sing, "Praise God all creatures here below." There are other similarities to "aboriginal" beliefs in the Bible and later Jewish literature. The laws of Leviticus 17 and Deuteronomy 12 allow the con sumption of flesh, but not of the "life" of the animal, which is to be returned to God or to the earth in the form of its blood. This recognition of something in animals given by God that humans may not take runs counter to an ex ploitative worldview, and may have analogues in Native American and other cultures. Even the stridently monotheistic postbiblical Book of Jubilees envisions the first day of creation as including not only heaven and earth and light and dark, but the "angels of the spirits" of weather phenomena and of the seasons, and "all of the spirits of [God's] creatures which are in heaven and on earth" (2:2). The narrowing of monotheism to leave God virtually alone in heaven and humanity alone on earth, while second nature to us, may represent a radical departure from the biblical perspective. It seems necessary also to speculate (one can hardly do more) on the differ ence between human subjectivity and that of trees. Exactly how far and in what direction ought one to go in thinking of the "agency" of plants? Have they a will to beauty or gracefulness? The authors acknowledge that what a tree ex periences as will and what humans experience as will must be two entirely different things. But should we use an anthropomorphism like "will" at all? If there is a subjectivity of plants, it may include other things, totally unlike what we know as "will," of which we cannot even properly conceive. Hence the difficulty of biblical metaphors of trees (not to speak of rivers) praising God. The metaphors of clapping and singing incorporate things that trees do not have, hands and voices. The metaphor must mean that trees do something that is comparable to what we do with those things when we praise God. Perhaps for a tree that is the extrusion of a limb or the curl of a twig in a certain man ner, or merely the lengthening of the trunk in fantastic straightness to fantastic heights, something, indeed, more analogous to dance than to song. These are odd fancies for a biblical scholar to entertain. But then the Bible is an odd set of books by modern standards, and studying them in their historical settings means using care in many ways not to impose our outlook on them. I appreciate the stimulus given by Walsh, Karsh, and Ansell to exercise this caution in yet another wav. David Rensberger Atlanta, Georgia 564 CROSS CURRENTS</page></plain_text>
