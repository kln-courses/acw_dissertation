<plain_text><page sequence="1">BEING HUMAN IN THE COSMOS M. D. Stafleu Introduction In recent years philosophical anthropology has been the subject of an extensive discussion within the circle of Calvinian philosophy. Among other things, this has resulted in an issue of Philosopbia Reformata with contri butions by Dengerink, Glas, Ouweneel and Troost.1 The discussion has left me with a feeling of dissatisfaction. The profoundness and the quality of the publications are beyond doubt, but I cannot suppress the impression that little progress is achieved. This is sad, because Dooyeweerd himself con sidered his anthropology to be unfinished, like a beginning that ought to be elaborated with the help of the special sciences. It may be wondered what could be wrong with the approach of anthropology up till now. I mention a few possibilities. 1. Most striking in the discussion during the past years is the absence of the theory of evolution. For the participants in the international conference on anthropology at Zeist in 19862 and for the contributors to the above men tioned issue of Philosopbia Reformata it seems as if Darwin never existed, and as if no progress has been made in biological and astrophysical insights concerning the development of the cosmos. The participants in the discussion seem to take no interest in the natural scientific contribution to anthropology. For my part, I am convinced that anthropology is in need of all sciences, and is doomed to sterility if an impor tant segment is neglected. In particular the development of anthropology within the context of the Philosophy of the Cosmonomic Idea badly needs uit oLuuy ui uic cvuiuuuii ui niaiucina in me universe, ana tne position or humanity with respect to the kingdoms of plants and animals. Verburg recalls that Dooyeweerd did not finish his anthropological work3 because he did not see a solution to the problem of evolution.4 Evidently, Dooyeweerd attributed the study of evolution a key position.

STAFLEU exceptions his followers did not make conspicious attempts to fill in this hiatus.5 Contrary to his intention, Dooyeweerd's careful and deliberate reaction to Lever's epoch-making work6 appears to have blockaded rather than ad vanced the development of anthropology. Probably it prevented many natu ral scientists from contributing positively to the systematic analysis of the Philosophy of the Cosmonomic Idea. 2. It is generally recognized that Dooyeweerd's theory of enkaptic struc tural interlacements should be one of the starting points of anthropology.7 But then it is surprising that so little attention is paid to a necessary élabora tion of this theory. No author discussing Dooyeweerd's so-called "anthropo logical theses"8 fails to mention his récognition of three basic substructures in the structure of the human body, to wit the physical-chemical, the biotic, and the psychic ones. Should one not consider a spatial and/or a kinematic substructure P9 Is it not the case that besides a primary qualification of substructures (characterized by the "leading" or "qualifying" modal sphere) a secondary characteristic also exists (determined by the "founding" aspect)? As a conséquence, the number of substructures to be found in the human body would amount to 1 (spatial) + 2 (kinematic, i.e., spatially and numerically founded, respectively) + 3 (physical) + 4 (biotic) + 5 (psychic) - 15.10 This makes things rather complicated, but to ignore this state of affairs implies neglecting a fruitful application of the systematic part of the Philosophy of the Cosmonomic Idea to anthropology. Moreover, these structures of the human body have mostly a retroci patory character, albeit that anticipations are already operative. Still, should one not explore the possibility that the human spirit is determined by anticipating structures ? 3. In my opinion too little attention is paid to the relations of every human being with his or her fellow créatures, in particular his or her fellow women or men (which are, of course, not entirely neglected) and the worlds of 5 Of course, a lot has been wrinen on the subject of évolution, usually in a négative sense.

In this respect Dooyeweerd's view of so-called cosmic time is extreme ly important.11 Unfortunately, once more it has to be concluded that the participants in the debate on anthropology are too much concerned with the clarification of Dooyeweerd's views (sometimes arriving at unsufficiently founded proposais for radical changes concerning the meaning of time), and too little with the strongly needed development of Dooyeweerd's revolutio nary conception of cosmic time. In particular the idea that ail relations have an intrinsic temporal character hardly plays a part in the discussion.12 4. Neglecting the problem of évolution implies that hardly any attention is paid to the question in which respects a human being differs ffom an animal. Usually the problem is dismissed by stating (without much argument) that animais (contrary to human persons) are only objects, not subjects, with respect to post-psychical laws, without wondering whether this might be a rationalistic point of view.1^ it could detract from another thesis defended by the Philosophy of the Cosmonomic Idea, i.e., the statement that a human being is primarily a religious being, cailed to bear responsibility, to promote what is good and to combat what is wrong. This means that religion not only implies a relation between any person and his Creator, but also a mission of mankind. It also means that the distinction between "natural laws" and "norms" should be reconsidered.14 The theme of the present paper is the position of any human being in the cosmos. In Part 1 I shall discuss a person as a subject in the various modal aspects. In Part 2 the relation of mankind to the so-called natural kingdoms will be investigated. In Part 3 we shall pay attention to the position of humanity in the history of the cosmos. The problems of the structure of the human body, the relation of body and spirit, and the human "self", will only summarily be touched. My intention is not to discuss extensively the contributions mentioned earlier to the debate on anthropology, but to look for alternative, i.e., com plementary roads. 1. Cosmlc time The first part of this paper is devoted to the so-called subject-subject relations in the modal aspects of reality. It forms a major, though by no 11 Cf. Dooyeweerd op. cit. (c), vol. 3, 781: "... the most important problem of philos o phical reflection: What is man's position in the temporal cosmos in relation to his divine Origin ? ... a philosophie anthropology présupposés an enquiry into the different dimen sions of the temporal horizon with its modal and individuality structures." 12 According to Dooyeweerd op. cit. (d), Stelling XIV, the "act-life" ("act-leven") of a human being is expressed in three fundamental directions: knowledge, imagination, and volition ("... de drie grondrichtingen van kennen, zich verbeelden en willen ..."). It is not difïïcult to recognize temporal relations in this triad: knowledge can only be based on past experience; insight in the present state of affairs does not only présupposé knowledge, but also imagination; and volition is evidently directed to the future. All the same, it is not clear why knowledge, imagination and volition should be restricted to buman acts, be cause animal behaviour contains the same elements. *3 See, however, Dengerink op. cil. (a), 249. 14 Cf. Dengerink op. cit. (a), 222-223.</page><page sequence="4">104 M. D. STAFLEU means the only, part of "cosmic time", which encompasses everything cre ated into a coherent whole. The coherence of reality is expressed by the faa that nothing can exist without having relations to other things. Hence, cosmic time is the set of all relations between ail créatures. Dooyeweerd's challenging and thought-provoking theory of time is strongly programmatic. It demands an élaboration involving the special sciences and their philosophies. It is still underdeveloped, but it is promi sing, and in my view indispensable for the development of anthropology. One of the ambitions of the Philosophy of the Cosmonomic Idea is to design an anthropology that shows humanity in its modal diversity. This implies finding the position of a person in cosmic time, i.e., the cosmic connection of any human being with his fellow men and women (in the past, the present and the future) and with all other créatures. A reliable anthropology cannot arise as long as the framework of cosmic time is not available as a well developed system. The theory states that the mutually irreducible modal aspects are not only ontic aspects of reality - besides epistemic aspects of our experience and principles of explanation - but also have a temporal structure. 1.1. Time as a System of reference Each aspect détermines temporal relations, subject to a modal order of time. Together, the modal aspects constitute a system of reference, enabling us to identify things and events, to détermine their quantity, spatial position, relative motion, interaction, etc., and to relate them to other things and events. For the first six modal aspects this System of reference can be sum marized as follows. First we have a numerical framework that allows us to compare different things and events in a quantitative sense. Next we have a spatial framework, enabling us to détermine the relative position of anything, and to orientate ourselves in our surroundings. Third, we experience a mode of mobility in which the moving thing remains identical with itself. Fourth, we recognize the relation of interaction, without which physical things and events would not exist. Fifth we encounter the relation of descendence, allowing us to relate living beings with each other. Sixth, there is a sense of teleology and communication (dépendent on récognition) as a psychic relation. The désignation of the modal intersubjective relations cannot be done loosely. It ought to be based on a careful analysis of the modal aspect concerned including ils retrocipations and anticipations, and of the idio nomic structures which are qualified or founded by the aspect concemed. Until now this has only been done for the first six modal aspects indicated above.15 From an anthropological perspective, I shall put forward some suggestions with respect to the remaining aspects, and reconnoitre some problems involved. Research into the subject-subject relations in the post-psychic aspects is M. D. Stafleu (d), 'Analysis of Tune in Modem Physics', Phil.Ref. 35 (1970) 1-24, 119— 131; (e) Time and Again (Toronto 1980); (0 'Some Problems of Time — Some Facts of Life', Phil.Ref. 51 (1986) 67-82; op.cit. (a), (b). (c).</page><page sequence="5">BHNG HUMAN IN THE COSMOS 105 not merely essential to anthropology, but unavoidably also part of it. The study of the numerical up to the psychic aspect can be restricted to non human subjects: numbers, spatial figures, moving subjects, physical Systems, living and learning beings. For methodological reasons it is even advisable to restrict the investigation of the modal aspects concerned initially to non human beings. For the post-psychic aspects this is virtually impossible. After all, even if animais are not excluded, human persons are the main subjects in these aspects. This gives rise to a number of complications, some of them related to the order of the modal aspects.16 We shall discuss these problems when we meet them. 1.2. The opposing attitude of a human being Apparently, the logical aspect is concerned with "thinking about ...", but this emphasizes the subject-object relation too much. Whoever wants to put the subject-subject relation to the fore may observe that logic concerns convincing. This means the discussion between two logical subjects, who attempt to achieve agreement about something on which their opinions differed before. In this way they arrive at a rational order in their environ ment. This can be done either in a direct manner, or indirectly, in an abstract, objectifying and theoretical way. The discussion, if logical, is subject to the law of excluded contradiction. Within a certain context agreed upon, no contradictions are allowed. With respect to the logical aspect, Dooyeweerd has stressed that a human being makes use of two different attitudes. The first is natural (or "naive") experience, which by the way is not purely logical. The second is the so called Gegenstand-iefoüon, which, according to Dooyeweerd, is a charac teristic of theoretical thought. In this relationship a thinking subjea opposes the logical aspect against ail other aspects, which are analytically detached from the continuous coherence (as established by cosmic time) between the modal aspects and the idionomic structures.17 This detachment includes methodological isolation and idealization. Such an opposing and therefore critical attitude does not occur in theo retical thought only. It occurs wherever a human being leaves natural expe rience, by putting an instrument between himself and his object. A telling example is how people extend their sensorial abilities by using a telescope or a microscope. In this case, too, one assumes an opposing attitude, creating distance, and narrowing one's vision. One sees further, but one's field of view 16 I shall hold to the order of the modal aspects as proposed by Dooyeweerd. For an alternative order, see Hart op. cit., 152, 190-198. The détermination of the order of the post-psychic aspects is hampered by the faa that humans are simultaneously subject to all these aspects, which are moreover functioning in so-called opened-up form. The study of the retrocipations is not much of a help either, because in the later aspects retrocipations become more and more complicated. 17 Dooyeweerd op.öt. (c) vol.2, 466 and beyond. For a criticism of Dooyeweerd's views, see e.g., D. F. M. Strauss, Begrip en idee (Assen 1973); H. Dooyeweerd, T)e kentheoretische Gegenstandsrelatie en de logische subject-objectrelatie', Phil.Ref. 40 (1975) 83-101 and 41 (1976) 1-8; J. D.

STAFLEU becomes smaller. The observed object is more or less abstracted from the cohérence in which it fonctions. This attitude of opposition has conséquences for the study of cosmic time. In the first six modal aspects (i.e., the numerical, spatial, kinematic, physical, biotic and psychical ones) subjective time can be characterized by a direct relation between "modal subjects". The concept of a "modal subject" is an abstraction from concrete reality. lts meaning is to abstract from the indivi duality and idionomy of the concrete things, in order to arrive at their modal détermination. Each modal subject-subject relation is itself subject to a modal order of time. In this way we introducé abstract notions like numbers and their relations, such as their différence or ratio, subject to the order of earlier and later; spatial figures related by their relative position and orientation, subject to the order of simultaneity; moving subjects and their relative motion, subject to the order of the flow of time; physical Systems with their mutual interactions subject to the order of irreversibility; living beings and their genetic relations subject to the genetic law stating that any living being is a descendent of another living being; and learning beings, with their ability to communicate, subject to the teleological law of goal directedness.18 Each of these subject-subject relations has a direct character. For instance, an animal immediately recognizes another animal, as a mate, a young or parent, as a prey, an enemy, or neutral. This direct character does not ex clude the médiation of other subjects of the same kind. For instance, one physical System can interact with another via a third, and we can détermine the relative position of two spatial things using a coordinate System. Besides we have the habit of objectifying subject-subject relations, e.g., using a map in order to détermine the distance between two cities. This is especially, but not exclusively done in science. We objectify spatial relative positions by distances and angles, kinematic relations by velocities, interactions by ener gy, force, current, and so on. Nevertheless the fondamental modal subject-subject relations maintain their direct character. This is also the case in the later modal aspects, as far as it concerns the "na tu ral" fonctioning of humans and animais. Dooyeweerd has shown that natural (or "naive") experience has a direct character, and should not be confused with theoretical experience, which has an opposing and distantiating character. Elsewhere I have developed this view in my own way,19 first by making distinction between scientific work and theoretical thought.20 Second, by observing that theoretical thought discloses natural thought, because it anticipâtes the formative, lingual and other modal aspects 18 Cf. footnote 15. 19 Cf. M. D. Stafleu (g), Théories as Logically Qualified Artefacts', Pbil.Ref. 46 (1981) 164 189; 47 (1982) 20-40; (h), Théories ai Work (Lanham MD 1987). 20 Scientific work, qualified by the historic-formative aspea indudes theoretical thought, qualified by the logical aspect, but it is more. Science also means experiment, observation, calculation, excavation, dissection, and many other forms of investigation that cannot be called "theoretical thought". Science has a spécifie goal, i.e., the investigation of the laws of the cosmos, whereas theoretical thought lacks an intrinsic goal, and is therefore appli cable for various purposes. Théories are widely used, also outside science. The identifi cation of "science" with "theoretical thought" has caused a lot of unnecessary confusion.</page><page sequence="7">BHNG HUMAN IN THE COSMOS 107 following the logical one. Third, by analysing the idionomic structure of theoretical thought.21 Fourth, by observing that theoretical thought has an instrumental character which is lacking in na tu ral thought. Now this instrumental character introducés a complication into the theory of time, which is absent in the direct subject-subject relations mentioned above. To be sure, insuuments are primarily used in subject-oty'ec/ relations, which lose their simplicity by becoming subject-instrument-object relations. In theoretical thought a person uses théories and similar structural units as instruments to investigate the cosmos. However, the logical subiet-subject relation has an instrumental character as well. In any discussion transcending natural interhuman relations, artificial concepts, propositions and théories are needed. This is by no means restricted to science. The opposing, distantiating attitude is absent in the natural experience of humans as well as in the functioning of animais. It makes an important différence between humans and animais, not only occurring in the logical aspect. A person takes distance from the cosmos, of which he or she is a wholesale part.22 A person is even taking critical distance from his or her fellow men and women, and this influences the interhuman relationship in all its aspects. 1.3. Creativity The fact that human beings design and make instruments is only possible because they disclose ail modal aspects in the so-called anticipatory direc tion. Also this is relevant for the study of the modal aspects firom an anthro pological perspective. With respect to the pre-logical aspects much can be achieved by restric ting oneself to the study of the aspect concemed with its retrocipations (i.e., referring to earlier modal aspects), and to the study of the idionomic struc tures which are qualified by that aspect. For instance, it is very fruitful to study the physical aspect including the preceding "mathematical" aspects as well as the physically qualified idionomic structures, but ignoring the following aspects. At first in biology it becomes necessary to include the anticipations in the physical aspect In the post-psychic aspects such a methodological restriction is virtually impossible. One could propose to study animais in this respect, but that would probably not yield very much of interest. Dooyeweerd seems to have assumed that so-called "primitive people" are functioning in a not-yet dis 21 Theoretical thought makes use of a number of logically qualified structures, which are absent in natural thought. These are concepts (numerically founded), statements or propositions (spatially founded), théories (founded in the logical motion from axioms to proven theorems), etc. Of course, neither natural nor theoretical thought can be taken apart from the thinking subject, who as a human being always belongs to full reality. In a more or less complete analysis of theoretical thought one has to consider ail modal aspects and idionomic structures. See my op.cit. (h). 22 The opposing attitude can easily lead to a dualism, as for instance in the humanistic motive of "nature and freedom". In my opinion this is not restricted to the logical Gegen standsrelation.</page><page sequence="8">108 M. D. STAFLEU closed community, but that is subject to doubt.23 In général, a human being opérâtes anticipating in every modal aspect, i.e., always referring to later as well as to earlier modal aspects. Hence it is nearly impossible to investigate the post-psychic aspects one after the other, in a way that has proven successful in the natural sciences. In the process of disclosure the historie, formative or cultural aspea plays a major part. Mankind not only deforms the non-living universe, but also living nature. This again draws the attention to the subject-object relation, but also the cultural subject-subject relation has the character of formation. We find this relation in éducation, schooling, and each form of tuition, some times directly (apprenticeship), sometimes more distantly. The nuclear word is "tradition", meaning the transfer of cultural achievements from one généra tion to the other. Tradition and tuition are not purely cultural in a modal sense, just because they have an anticipatory character. Ail modal aspects are involved in tradition. 1.4. Front inward to ontward Human beings and animais have an inner experience, which is organically localized in the nerve system. Animais express this experience nearly exclu sively in their behaviour. Sometimes animais have other ways to give expres sion to their émotions, in particular fear. Warnings, and the marking of a territory, can be considered as examples of elementary, undisclosed and instinctive uses of language. In contrast, people have the habit of communicating their inner expe rience to other people, to express themselves. Thereby they reveal their fee lings, émotions, opinions, thoughts, insights, judgements, problems, plans, orders, reports, prohibitions, and beliefs. That is the meaning of language, in ail its appearances: signais, natural language (like English or Dutch), written language, group language, traffîc signs, and ail other kinds of symbols. Ail these are subject to the norm of clarity. The lingual subject-subject relation, in which language plays an instrumen tal mediating part, is not first of ail determined by the need of communi cation (which has a psychic character), but by the need of name giving and interprétation. With the help of language a human being allots himself and others a position in the cosmos, besides ail things and events. The lingual aspect of human experience should be distinguished from the natural languages - or rather "so-called" natural languages, for even the language of speech is already an artefact, having a long history and being strongly differentiated. The same applies to written language. For any pur pose, language is an indispensable instrument for interhuman communi cation, and it is interwoven with other instruments, like logical concepts and propositions. Every person belongs to a lingual community, sometimes to more than one. Such a lingual community does not constitute a community with an internai organisation, with an officiai structure. It cannot act as a modal 23 cf. S. Griffioen, 'De betekenis van Dooyeweerd's ontwikkelingsidee', Phil.Ref. 51 (1986) 85-109.</page><page sequence="9">BHNG HUMAN IN THE COSMOS 109 subject. The romantic ideology according to which a modem state should be founded in a lingual community has given rise to many serious conflicts. In a state community a single language is sometimes privileged, and other lan guages are discriminated. Besides the général language of speech with its dialects one finds group languages with their typical jargon. The position of a person in the cosmos is strongly determined by his mastery and use of various languages. 1.5. Social communities as modal subjects No less important for a person's place in the cosmos are her or his social relations. The study of social communities is part of the study of the idionomic structures and their relations. But the fact that social communities can be subjects in the modal aspects is a reason to consider them in the framework of the modal aspects as well. Usually one distinguishes between natural communities (like marriage, nuclear family, family in a wider sense, tribe, which are also recognizable with animais), and organized communities, like business firms, schools, hospitals, states, and churches. The former are biotically founded, and differ from animal communities because their functions are disdosed and normative in ail aspects. Sometimes they suffer of a loss of functionality, because certain tasks are taken over by other communities. The latter seem to be founded in the cultural-formative aspect. The social subject-subject relation concerns the various ways people interact with each other. It is subject to the norm of mutual respect, which is specified by the relative position they have in society, in particular in many different communities. Two persons can meet each other: the first is a mem ber, the other an elder in church; the first is director, the second employee in the same company; the first is chairman of a club, the second its secretary. In each of these three relations the two have to respect each other in a different way. Without respect or récognition no social relationship can en dure. Together these relationships détermine a social order. Mutual respect is the foundation of a free society.24 In particular a free society can only exist if the various communities respect each other*s responsibility, in a normative way. How is it possible that a community functions like a modal subject ? In part because a community exists independent of the identity of its members. A club remains in existence long after its first members have withdrawn or died. On the other hand no community can exist without members. It can only act as a subject if it is represented by some authorized person. This authorization again rests on récognition. Nobody is able to act with authority within a community if she does not have the respect of the members of that community. Without mutual respect the community collapses. For the external functioning, too, it is necessary that somebody be identified and 2&lt;* Dengerink op.ciL (a), 237-239, relates freedom with the spatial aspect In my view this can only be correct if freedom is considered a spatial retrocipation in the social aspecL</page><page sequence="10">110 M. D. STAFLEU recognized as a représentative of the community concerned. In Sec. 1.8 I shall find occasion to say more about the figure of a représentative. The functioning of social communities as modal subjects is opened up by the economie aspect (a business company), the aesthetic aspect (an orche stra), the juridical aspect (the state), the aspect of care (hospitals), and the aspect of faith (the church). 1.6. The many-sided possibilités of a person Besides other things human beings differ from animais because of their many-sidedness. Every kind of animal displays a certain speciality, which is developed in the course of évolution, and often a certain animal species excels mankind with respect to its speciality. (Never try to outrun a tiger.) A human being's body is not specialized. Even the development of the neo cortex is a function of his many-sidedness. Any person has many possibili ties, and this makes specialization witbin human societies necessary. It would be very inefficient to do everything on one's own. It is much more econo mical to divide our work and to cooperate in peace in order to exploit all human possibilities. In a well-developed society people have various occu pations, and one's occupation is an important determinant for one's place in the community. Therefore the many-sidedness of people should be discussed in the framework of the economie modal aspect. The economie subject- object relation concerns the efficient use of all available means. The sub\ea-sub]ect relation concerns the delivery of services wherein each person makes other persons profit from her or his special gifts. Hence the norm of the econo mie aspect is to be of service to one's fellow beings. The mutual rendering of service soon leads to the need of some kind of seulement or accounting, hence to barter or a monetary System, a market of supply and demand. In a général sense, the "market" may be considered to indicate the economie order. For this view it is relatively irrelevant whether the market is "free" or "planned". Besides a market of various goods, there is a market of employment, a money market, stock exchange, and even a marriage market. The many-sidedness of human beings allows them to play various parts, for instance as a producer, a consumer, a merchant, a negotiator, an infor mer, and so on. We observe a certain kind of asymmetry in economie rela tions: producer versus consumer, for instance. This is not restricted to the economie functioning of humans. Hence we meet another complication in the study of the modal aspects: it is virtually impossible to abstract the functioning of a person such that a pure "modal subject" remains. 1.7. Homo ludens Another différence between hu mans and animais is the need of people to decorate their existence, to enjoy themselves, to create and experience beauty and pleasure. In the relation between the sexes one finds with animais something of beauty and play too, but then it is merely retrocipatory and instinctive.</page><page sequence="11">BHNG HUMAN IN THE COSMOS 111 For an investigation of the arts the phenomenon of "subject-instrument subject relation" mentioned above could be of help. We can easily be focussed on a painter as a subject and his paintings as objects of art, and forget about the art lovers. In my view art can only be understood as func tioning in a subject-subject relation, even if it is asymmetrical, such as the relation between the painter and the onlooker. It means that the painting is not an object but an instrument, the object being whatever the painter wants to paint, irrespective if this is something visible (like a landscape), a fantasy, some émotion, or what not. The painting is an instrument in the aesthetic relation between the painter and the spectator, and next between various spectators. The interhuman relation between the artist and the spectators is perhaps more obvious in theater, ballet and musical performances. In order to determine the character of the aesthetic subject-subject relation it may be advised to pay attention to joy and sorrow, to festivities and mourning, to plays and rites, expressing direct relations. The arts and organized sports are more distantiating. Discipline and compétition are relevant points. It is only possible to communicate in festivals, plays, mour nings, rites, and sports if one adhères to the rules. People compete, and thereby determine each other*s relative positions. Often the rules of play are no less artificial than products of art. Perhaps rules of play are not norms, but it is a norm to obey the rules. The aesthetic subject- object relation cornes to the fore in ornaments, beautiful clothing, delicious food, and objects of art 1.8. Office Discussing the social aspect I said something about the figure of an "authorized person" serving on behalf of a community as a subject in the modal aspects. This figure also has an important juridical fonction. This is especially the case if a community is a légal person. A "légal person" is an abstract modal subject (cf. Sec. 1.2) in the juridical sphere. "Ail natural persons are légal persons" is an ideologically coloured statement. Under Roman law slaves were in général not considered légal subjects, but légal objects, and the légal status of women was disputed. In a Christian society slavery is not accepted, and minors are légal persons, even though they should be represented occasionally by their parents or guardians. The con stitutional rule "ail people are equal before the law* is relatively modem, and still not universally accepted. Besides natural persons a modem society recognizes communities as légal persons. The institutional system of justice is the state, having the task to maintain the légal order. It has the authority to recognize non-state commu nities as légal persons. Within such a community it should be clear which natural persons as "officers" have the right to represent the community in légal affairs. Yet if a social community has no légal status it is not unlawfol. The inner structure of a social community is independent of its being a légal person. An "office" can be defined as a set of tasks and powers, and an "officer" as somebody who is charged with an office, for which she or he can be held</page><page sequence="12">112 M. D. STAPLEU responsible. The juridical aspect of an "office" should be distinguished from the authority that the same "officer" exercises within the community, which is based on social respect, as we argued above. A club which is no legal person still knows such authority. In particular the authority in na tu ral com munities like a nuclear family is exerted independent of the consent of the state. Conversely, within a community an officer can lose his or her authority and still be responsible in a juridical sense. Hence, the status of an "office" is not necessarily juridically qualified, but is usually (but not always) qualified by the same aspect as the community in which the office acts. For instance, the office of an entrepreneur is econo mically qualified. On the other hand, the office of an employer is also econo mically qualified, but it is often exerted by officers of a community which is itself not economically qualified, such as a hospital. In this case the director of the hospital has the office to look after the economie aspects of the hospital. Not surprisingly, in large communities the various offices are often separated from each other. Hence the juridical subject-subject relation is not restricted to natural persons. It is a relation, which can be positivized in various ways. The posi tivation of norms becoming rules may be more characteristic for the juridical modal aspect than the principles of attribution or rétribution which are usually taken to be the nucleus of this aspect. The juridical relations as laid down in positive law determine the legal position of all people in the cosmos, determining their rights and duties, and their liabilities. 1.9. Tbe care for one's fellow bumans The last but one aspect, usually denoted the "ethical" or "moral" one, has the love for one's neighbour as its principle. Perhaps the word "care" could be used to characterize this aspect.25 It concerns the love for one's neigh bour (a subject-subject relation), but also the commitment of a person to her environment and the products of her labour (subject-object relations), and the care with which she handles them. This function is not orüy apparent in the care for the weak in the society (children, sick or elderly people, the unemployed, refugees), but also in human relations such as concern, compassion or pity, sympathy or anti pathy, aversion and indifférence. The term "love for one's neighbour" shows that each person's responsibility for her or his fellow human is a function of the position that this person has with respect to other people. It starts within the natural communities: marriage, the family. Without the experience of such love people become lonely - without love a person fïnds no place on earth. 25 Dengerink op.ciL (a), 227, speaks about this aspect in terms of "dienstbaarheid of ter beschikking zijn" (to be of service). Hart op. cit. 191 uses the terms "... troth, loyalty and faithfulness ... Keeping troth is standing in permanent relations of trust, keeping one's promise. Keeping troth is the subjective ethical response to the call for truth". I think these catégories belong to the aspect of faith or certitude.</page><page sequence="13">BHNG HUMAN INTHECOSMOS 113 1.10. Transcendence: a person as a believer The anticipating character of ail human acts (which we already mentioned in the framework of the formative aspea) also has a transcending aspea. In every anticipation (i.e., the référencé of some aspea to a later one) human beings transcend a modal aspea. Therefore it is relevant to observe that animal fonctions in the post-psychic aspects are merely retrocipatory (i.e., only referring back to the earlier aspects, in particular the psychic and biotic ones). A person is able to transcend aspects and structures of temporal reality, without ever being able to leave behind his or her interhuman rela tions. The pistic subjea-subjea relation concerns shared convictions, certain ties, points of departure, world views and idéologies. These can be religious, but also philosophical, sdentific, or political. An ideology is not merely Personal. Each society has an ideology, a common creed, even if it is cyni cal.26 The ideology détermines the norms to which the society has to answer. The ideology transcends ail modal diversity, because its roots are in the heart of the people.27 It is a leading faaor in the opening up of ail modal aspects, and is highly determining for the position of a person (as well as for each community) in the cosmos, in particular for the position that he assigns himself. It is not without reason that people call themselves Christians or Muslims, socialists or capitalists, positivists or realists. It marks in various contexts the choice of one's position. If somebody changes his ideology, this is rightly called a "conversion". ine pistic subject-subject relation is determined by mutual trust we be lieve each other on our word.28 We make promises, and other people trust them. The antidpatory character comes to the fore in the hope for a better future. Someone's credibility is also determined by the office that he or she exercises. The pistic subject-object relation is denoted by terms like the belief in the correctness of a message, the fairness of a report, the reliability of an appa ratus, the safety of a means of transport, and so on. One person guarantees another that a purchase is reliable. The possibility to transcend the modal aspects (and the idionomic struc tures as well) also implies a certain amount of relativization. The anticipations show that no aspect must be absolutized. This even applies to idéologies, for which every person is himself responsible, whereas he has to respect the ideological self-determination of any other person. In particular every com munity (induding the state) has to respect the personal beliefs of any person, 26 τ. S. Kuhn's "paradigms" and I. Lakatos's 'research programmes" both have a recog nized ideological flavour. According to Kuhn and Lakatos these détermine the "social matrix" of a group of scientists. 27 Cf. J. D. Kim, "Wissen und Glauben bei I. Kant und H. Dooyeweerd', Pbil.Ref. 48 (1983) 1-145. 28 Cf. Dengerink op. cit. (a), 223-227. Meanwhile, J. D. Dengerink (c), 'Mens, kosmos, tijdelijkheid, eeuwigheid η. a.ν. W. J. Ouweneel, De leer van de meni, Pbil.Ref. 54 (1989) 83-102, adds the characterization of "eternity" to the pistic aspect This is a conséquence of Dengerink's view of time as being the first modal aspect, preceding the numerical one. 1 have given my comments on this proposai in my op. cit (c).</page><page sequence="14">114 M. D. STAFLEU as well as the idéologies of any other community. Without such respect, freedom is lost. Hence the possibility to transcend modality and structurality is very im portant for the human "selfness", his or her unique personality. It means that each person is religious, for ultimately, transcending means to be reaching out beyond the limits of the cosmos. 1.11. Conclusion In part 1 of this paper I discussed the position of a person in the cosmos with respect to the modal aspects, stressing the importance of the "subject subject relation" as a temporal relationship. It would be wide of the mark to give the impression that interhuman relations were never discussed in the framework of the Philosophy of the Cosmonomic Idea or in Christian anthropology. But as far as I know the subject-subject relation has never been used as a methodological instrument for the study of anthropology. If I have convinced the reader of the potential fruitfulness of such an approach, I have reached my goal. 2. The position of human persons in the natural kingdoms In the second part of this paper we shall pay attention to the position of a person in the so-called "kingdoms". Usually one recognizes three kingdorns: that of minerais, that of the plants, and that of the animais. Elsewhere I have argued that the Philosophy of the Cosmonomic Idea allows of more king doms, i.e., that of spatial forms and that of structured motions.29 Besides there are kingdoms which are qualified by the aspects beyond the psychical one. In général, we shall consider a kingdom the set of all individual "things and events" with typical structures qualified by a single modal aspect They have the same "radical type". This term refers to the law side of the qualifying aspect, whereas the term "kingdom" refers to the subject-side (i.e., every thing that answers the radical type). Every kingdom is characterized by the subject-subject and subject-object relations determined by the modal aspect concerned.30 For instance, for the kingdom of physical things and events interaction is characteristic, insofar as something assumed not to interact with other physical things does not belong to the physical kingdom, and therefore cannot have physical exis tence. In this paper I shall mostly restrict myself to a discussion of a person's position in the traditional "natural" kingdoms of minerais, plants, and ani mais. 29 Cf. Sufleu op. ciL (a) and (b). In pan 2 of the present paper I shall bypass the king doms qualified by the spatial and kinematic aspects. 3° Roughly speaking, "things" (including plants and animais) are characterized by subjea object relations, whereas an "event' is determined by a subject-subject relation. Cf. my op. cit. (a), (b).</page><page sequence="15">BHNG HUMAN IN THE COSMOS 115 2.1. The astrophysical kingdom For the détermination of the position of a human being in the cosmos within the kingdoms of individual things and events an obvious place to start is with the position of mankind in the astrophysical universe. This concerns the kingdom of physically qualified things, which interact with each other directly or via a third subject Since Copernicus observed that the distance of the earth to the sun is vanishingly small compared to the distance to the nearest stars, the universe became (according to our insights) larger and larger, and the earth compa rably smaller and smaller. Hence the habitat of humanity seems to be minutely small. This gives rise to the anthropological question of why the universe should be as large as it is: billions of light years. The answer given by some astrophysicists is surprising: it is so large in order to make space for humanity.31 That answer rests on at least two assumptions. The first concerns the astrophysical relation between the dimension of space and its age. This relation is laid down by the theory of cosmological évolution which states that the universe has expanded steadily for about fifteen billion years. A universe of the magnitude of our galaxy could contain enough matter for a hundred billion stars as large as the sun, but it would have existed for only one year, and merely contain hydrogen and helium. The formation of the other elements needed for the material existence of human beings took about ten billion years. The second assumption concerns the time needed for the évolution of mankind, starting from the beginning of the astrophysical évolution. A calculation of this period is unavoidably spéculative. In fact it rests on the simple fact that we exisL Considering the fact that humanity exists "now" (i.e., for the relatively short time of at most three million years), its évolution evidently needed more than ten billion years, including four billion years since the earth was formed. The existence of mankind is the best (and per haps only) proof of the possible existence of human beings.32 Hence the fact that the earth is a small and physically insignificant planet in a huge universe does not mean that humanity is insignificant. Barrow and Tiplefs book intends to demonstrate that the lawfulness and the évolution of the cosmos can only be understood by its destination, the évolution of mankind. In this context one speaks of the Anthropic Principle. The ob served structure of the universe is determined by the fact that we observe that structure. Because we are an essential part of the cosmos one could say that the cosmos observes itself.33 We cannot observe the universe as an 31 J. D. Barrow, F. J. Tipler, The Anthropic Cosmological Principle (Oxford 1986) 3. For a discussion of astrophysical cosmology from a Christian viewpoint, sec H. J. van Till, Tbe Fourth Day, What tbe Bible and the Heavens are telling us about tbe Création (Grand Rapids, Mich. 1986). 32 This is called the "Weak Anthropic Principle". It is nearly trivial, but it excludes models in which life, in particular human life, is impossible. This applies for instance to a model which excludes the formation of carbon. The present théories of évolution cannot explain the rise of mankind, but can explain why it took so long. 33 Cf. Barrow, Tipler, op. ciL, 4. The so-called "Strong Anthropic Principle" reads: "The</page><page sequence="16">116 M. D. STAFLEU object, from outside. By considering the universe as a whole we cannot escape including ourselves in our observations. This is the ultimate conséquence of a development started by Copernicus, when he explained the observed retrograde motion of the planets as an apparent motion, caused by the real motion of the earth from which we perform our observations.3* 2.2. The kingdom of living beings For mankind the earth is not in the first place a physically qualified celestial body among many others, but a grown-over and inhabited world. The age of the earth can be estimated in various ways to be of the order of four billion years. During this time the biosphere evolved: the relatively thin skin around the surface of the earth, in which all living beings and fossils can be found. Even the composition of the atmosphère, consisting of about 20% oxygen is probably of organic origin. The biosphere makes human life possible, and according to current théories of évolution mankind has evolved from that sphere. The habitat of human beings is, therefore, the earth, which fact does not prevent us from exploring the surroundings of the earth. Recently mankind has become conscious of the unicity of the biosphere, for the place of humanity in it, and for the responsibility that we have for the maintenance of our environment. 2.3. The closed functioning of animais in the post-psychic aspects Before discussing the place of human beings in the animal kingdom 1 want to pay attention to the subjective functioning of animais. It is a Standard view in the Philosophy of the Cosmonomic Idea that ani mais do not function as subjects in the post-psychic aspects.35 This accords with the traditional view that a human being distinguishes himself from an animal in particular because of his rationality, his ability to think. It therefore detracts from another view of this philosophy, namely that a person is pri marily religions. In the present section we shall consider the question whether it is true that animais, or at least the so-called higher animais, cannot be subjects (rather than objects) in the post-psychic aspects.36 To begin with, it will be difficult to maintain that animais have no distinguishing abilities. It is sometimes stated that human logical thinking is necessarily based on the use of concepts, and that animal distinguishing lacks Universe must have those properties which allow Life to develop within it at some stage in its history", op. cit. 21. It can be specified as "There exists one possible Universe 'de signed' with the goal of generating and sustaining 'observers", op. cit. 22. Barrow and Tipier call this interprétation 'religious". 3* Cf. Stafleu op. cit. 00 44-45. 35 Dooyeweerd op. cit. Cc), vol.l, 39; vol.2, 81, 114; vol.3, 58, 85. 36 cf. J. Lever (b), Geïntegreerde biologie (Utrecht 1973) 187-193. My views in this case are not identical with Dengerink's, op. cit. (a) 214, who effectively rejects the distinction between subjects and objects with respect to all concrete things etc, stating that anything concrete is subject in ail modal spheres. See also Hart op. cit. 176-182 for a discussion of animais functioning in the formative aspect.</page><page sequence="17">BEING HUMAN IN THE COSMOS 117 this ability. I think that the latter part of this statement is correct, but I also believe that conceptual thinking is opened-up thinking, theoretical thought. Natural thought is not necessarily linked up with conceptual thought Animal thought is natural, not opened-up, i.e., not anticipating later modal aspects. Conceptual thought implies the formation of concepts, hence anticipâtes the formative aspect.37 It also anticipâtes the lingual aspect, because concepts are worded. Hence, if animais do not use conceptual thought, this does not mean that they are not functioning subjectively in the logical modal aspect Some animais display a primitive use of language. The significance of the dance of bees is well known. Birds are able to warn each other against dan ger. In groups of apes a recognizable system of communication is esta blished. Many animais display social behaviour: bees, ants, birds during their seasonal migration, mammals living in herds, families of apes, etc. A certain amount of division of labour is sometimes unmistakable. Animais can behave economically and harmoniously. During the process of breeding a primitive ethical behaviour is recognizable. The formative activity of animais often results in the production of indivi dual objects like a bird's nest, the hole of a rabbit, and so on. With respect to plants one can speak of certain "products", for instance wood, which after the demise of the plant still shows a typical cellular structure. The above mentioned biosphere is a product of agelong organic and animal activity. Yet these are merely by-products, however important. Initially they are enkap tically bound in the structure of plants or animais, and they only achieve a relatively independent existence after being separated from their origin. In this respect wood, manure, etc. differ obviously from individual objects like a bird's nest. A nest has an evident structure which is biotically and psychically determined. lts structure is recognizable as belonging to a certain species. The nest of a sparrow differs from that of a blackbird. But the nest itself does not live and does not display any behaviour. It is not a subject in the biotic and psychic aspects, but an object. It is a subject in the aspects preceding the biotic one, but its structure is not determined by these aspects. It is an individual structured object with respect to those animais which made it or use it. We find this not only with birds and mammals, but also with insects (bees, ants), spiders (webs), and with fish. This formative behaviour virtually always has an instinctive character. The animais concerned can only behave in a singular way, which is heritably determined, and is often coercive. In général it should be stressed that the subjective functioning of animais in the post-psychic aspects is invariantly primitive and instinctive. It is retrocipatory, never anticipatory. It is retrocipatory, because all post-psychic behaviour of animais serves their biotic and psychic functioning, in particular feeding, reproduction and survival of the species.38 Human activity, on the contrary, is opened-up, anticipating, transcending, and therefore religious. 37 Cf. Stafleu (g). 38 In fact, I am proposing here a définition of "instinctive behaviour". Not ail animal behaviour is instinctive: animais are able to learn, and can change their patterns of beha viour accordingly. See my op.cit. (c).</page><page sequence="18">118 M. D. STAFLEU As a methodological rule, the question whether animais display subjective behaviour in the post-psychic aspects should not be answered in aa a priori way, but a posteriori, by empirical research. The present section should be read taking this into accounL 2.4. The structure of tbe buman body It is not my intention to discuss the structure of the human body extensively. I restrict myseif to a few remarks in order to discuss the position of mankind in the animal kingdom. In biological taxonomy a human being is a mammal, belonging to the order of the primates. The theory of enkapsis, the interlacement of struc tures, accounts for this state of affairs. The structure of a human body is interlaced with an animal substructure, and its nature détermines a person's position in the animal kingdom. Likewise, because of its organic substruc ture, an animal belongs to the organic kingdom, even though it simultaneous ly transcends this kingdom. The structure of an animal is not biotically but psychically qualified. Hence the fact that we assign mankind a place in the animal kingdom does not imply that its structure is psychically qualified, and it does not exclude the fact that the structure of the human body essentially differs from the animal body. The structure of the animal body, in which biotic, physical, kinematic and spatial substructures are enkaptically bound, is designed for the animal's be haviour. It is remarkable that in several respects the animal substructure of a human being is much more developed than the structure of any animal.39 Human thought is localized in the cérébral cortex, in particular the neo cortex, which is absent in most animais. In mammals it is present only to a small extent. The cultural aspect of human activity is most pregnantly expressed in the hand, an organ that is far more developed than whatever comparable animal organ. The nerve cells related to the hands take a rela tively large volume in the human brain. The lingual aspect finds its counter part in the speech centre, again a substantial part of the brain. Also the larynx, the tongue and the muscles of the jaws are such as to make speech possible. Similarly, the structure of the human face is made to show joy, sorrow or anger. The social development of a human child is furthered by the relatively short period of pregnancy, and by the relatively long period of growing up. More than any comparable animal the human child is unfinished at its birth, meaning that its individual possibilities to develop its faculties are much larger than those of any animal. All these différences in the body structure of humans and animais point to the open character of the "act structure" of a human person.40 It shows how 39 Cf. Lever op. cit. (a) Chapter 5; T. A. Goudge, De wijsgerige aspecten van de evolutie (transi, of: Tbe Ascent of Life (London 1961) Utrecht 1966) 160-183. 40 "The erect gait, the spiritual expression of the human face, the human hand formed to labour after a free project, testi/y to the fact that the human body is the free plastic instru ment of the I-ness, as the spiritual centre of human existence." Dooyeweerd op. cit. (c) vol. 3, 88. See also Dooyeweerd op. cit. (b), 153.</page><page sequence="19">BHNG HUMAN IN THE COSMOS 119 much the human body is directed to spiritual life. The open character can only be understood from the view that a person knows what it is to be called to bear responsibility, because he or she knows the différence between good and evil, as we shall see presently.41 2.5. Body and spirit The distinction between human persons and animais is often expressed by the supposed lack of a "mind" or "spirit* in the latter. In the present con text I can only give a very short comment on the relation between body and spirit. Dooyeweerd has stressed that the human body has a very complex structure (see the Introduction above). The élaboration of his views is much wanted. It is tempting to relate the distinction of body and spirit to the complementary directions of retrocipation and anticipation. We observed already that animal functioning in the post-psychic aspects (if present) is always retrocipatory, instinctive, directed to biotic and psychic needs. It should not be surprising to find that the functioning of a person, as far as it is retrocipatory, does not differ very much from that of the higher animais. But the human functioning (the "act-structure" according to Dooye weerd) is mostly anticipatory, directed towards the opening up of ail modal aspects, and even transcending them. Th is should be the leading motif of any Christian anthropology. This should not be misunderstood as the résurrection of the age old dualism of body and mind, supposed to be two different substances, whe ther or not interacting with each other. Nor do we intend to make a division between the "na tu ral" modal aspects (up to and including the psychic one) and the "spiritual" or "normative" aspects (starting from the logical one), which would again imply an untenable dualism. Rather, our proposai means the application to anthropology of a duality which is already present in Dooyeweerd's theory i.e., the duality of anticipatory and retrocipatory direc tions. It appears at the individual-structural side of reality. It replaces the structure of having a leading or qualifying aspect besides a foundational modal aspect, that is characteristic of virtually all other "radical types". The structure of a human person lacks both a foundational and a qualifying modal aspect. It is characterized by the simultaneous occurrence of retrocipatory ("bodily") and anticipatory ("spiritual") functioning of a human person as a whole. This applies to all modal aspects of human functioning. Hence, the death of a person does not mean the séparation of body and spirit: what remains is neither body nor spirit. And the résurrection concerns the human body as well as its spirit. From this point of view it would be rather silly to narrow the human mind down to his intellectuality. The main incentive for human anticipatory activity is the experience of good and evil, to which we now turn. Only after the fall did Adam and Eve become consüous of the fact that they were naked, i.e., different from animais. Clothing as a cultural phenomenon is typically human.</page><page sequence="20">120 M. D. STAFLEU 2.6. The experience of good and evil It is now generally accepted that the fondamental distinction between human beings and animais cannot be detennined on biological grounds only. Of course, there are relevant biotic différences between human persons and their nearest relatives, the apes. Nevertheless, the biotic distinction between a human and an ape is smaller than that between an ape and a horse. Humans and apes constitute different families of the same order of the primates. When paleontologists want to establish whether certain fossils are derived from ape-like or human-like beings they have to take recourse to non biological characteristics, like the use of fire, clothing, tools and omaments, the burial of the dead. The age-old tradition of seeking the différence be tween animais and human beings in human rationality seems to lie behind us. At present one looks for this distinction in culture, in language, in social organization and the like. In terms of the Philosophy of the Cosmonomic Idea this would mean that a human being is a subject to the post-psychic laws. bui we nave aireaay seen mac œing a suDject m mese aspects as sucn ts not sufficiënt for the distinction between humans and animais. The diffé rence is that animais at most function subjectively in a purely retrocipatory way, whereas human acts are anticipatory. During its history humanity has disclosed the various modal aspects. Human activity is not merely directed to the fulfilment of biotic and psychic needs, but is directed to answering a calling. Instead of speaking of the "act-structure" (or the human mind) one could speak of the "answering structuré" of humanity. In the Philosophy of the Cosmonomic Idea the post-psychic aspects are usually called "normative". According to this view (which I question) norms have the character of laws which can be trespassed by the subjects con cemed. Norms state how humans ought to behave, not how they actually behave. In my opinion the so-called natural laws also have a normative character as soon as they apply to human beings. There is some kind of graduai increase of "normativity" from the earlier modal aspects to the later ones. Laws in later modal aspects have a more obvious normative character than the "natural" laws. Still, a natural law like being fruitful becomes normative as soon as human subjects are involved. The distinction between "natural" and "normative" is not a feature of the laws as such. A law becomes a norm, as soon as a human person makes the distinction between good and evil. Laws can only be norms for créatures having a conscience for norms. The awareness of good and evil marks the birth date of humanity. The fact that animais can learn shows that they have a sense of lawfulness. But only people consider laws as normative. Human beings have discovered the exis tence of good and evil, in the animal world, in their environment, and last but not least in their own communities. For an example I point to the pheno menon of illness of plants and animais. Every biologist can explain that illness as such is a natural process. Only from a human point of view does it make sense to say that a plant or an animal is ill, and that this is anti-normative.</page><page sequence="21">BHNG HTJMAN IN THE COSMOS 121 Illness is an anthropomorphic concept. Also the so-called struggle for life is experienced as anti-normative by people only. All persons experience the calling to combat evil. This not only applies to evil observed in the plant and animal worlds, but also evil in themselves and in their fellow people. The calling to combat evil implies a sense of responsi bility for plants and animais and for humanity.42 In my view this is the most relevant distinction between humans and animais. An animal takes the world as it is, as givea A buman person attempts to better tbe worUL The awareness of good and evil constitutes the basis of culture. The sense of calling, which is the heart of human existence, cannot be traced back in any scientific way. From a philosophical point of view one can only establish that it exists. The question of the origin of this calling cannot be answered scientifically or philosophically, because it is a religious question. Hence the development of humanity from the animal kingdom cannot be scientifically explained or even dated. Rhetorical questions like: "Can you imagine that a gorilla mother gives birth to a human child ?" are therefore quite irrelevant The cultural development of humanity arises from human creativity, the human ability to design and make new things in order to better the world. In a closed form, the cultural modal aspect concerns mastery, the use of things, plants and animais for one's own needs. In this respect "culture" can also be found with animais: beavers building dams, ants exploiting aphides, birds using stones as tools, or building nests. The creativity of human beings dis closes these possibilities and brings new ones to the fore. Through cultural development humanity started to transcend the animal kingdom. For this end also language, the arts, society, the economie, juridical, ethical and faith aspects became disclosed. Each of these is a means to order, to promote the good, and to fight evil. A person no longer expériences the world merely as being psychical, but also as being logical, historical, and so on. More and more, the belief in one's calling has played a leading part in this évolution. Let us now consider the distinction between evil and sin. 2.7. Genesis In the first few chapters of Genesis the story of good and evil is told in biblical language. One is often inclined to read the first and second chapters apart from the third, the création apart from the fall into sin. Probably this dévaluâtes the story of the création as well as the story of the fall into sin. It is certainly better to read them as a whole. For instance, the text telling that God created man and woman "after his image" is more often than not cited out of its context. The context itself explains the meaning of this text: being the image of God means to rule the animal kingdom.43 Genesis tells us that God makes humanity responsible for 42 Cf. A. Troost, 'De openbaring Gods en de maatschappelijke orde', Pbll.Ref. 34 (1969) 1-37, pag. 21. 43 Genesis 1,26: "Let us make man in our image and likeness to rule the fish in the sea, the</page><page sequence="22">122 M. D. STAFLEU the création, as a steward, as God's représentative on earth.44 This inter prétation avoids the idea of making an image of God after man. The story of the serpent tempting Eve and Adam suggests that before the fall into sin evil was already present in the animal kingdom. This would mean that evil can be considered apart from humanity. However, the catégories good and evil only make sense from a human point of view, even though mankind perhaps recognized it at first in the animal world. Genesis 1 stresses repeatedly that God made the world "good". Evil entered the world only with humanity, not in the sense that evil only then came into existence, but because humans are called to consider it as such. Only when human beings started to commit evil themselves did it become sin. Increasing insight in the distinction between good and evil enables human beings to understand much better how to commit evil themselves. The belief in a calling degenerates into belief in one's own possibilities, love for one's neighbour into love for oneself, justice into arbitrariness, division of labour into slavery. Humanity wants to be allowed to use evil in order to further what is good in one's own eyes, the goal sanctifying the means. This is the fall into sin, from which humanity can only be saved by the complete sacrifice and self-denial of Christ The most pregnant expression of evil is death, destruction. In a stricdy biological sense death is not wrong, if it concerns the natural end of a plant or animal as a living individual Human beings fight death, seeking eternal life. Genesis contains the promise of eternal life, meaning the knowledge of God. Eternal life is like a window, from which a human person can look outside the plant and animal kingdoms. This window is opened by God himself, who allowed his son to become a man in order to tell us who is the father of humanity and the Creator of the cosmos. Christ is the real image of God, by conquering death in his résurrection. The victory over death does not mean that people will not die any longer, but that they have the prospect of résurrection, of eternal life. Eternal life means the knowledge of God, which is much more than logi cally qualified insight. Eternal life means meeting the Lord, which is made possible because God himself became humaa By meeting Jésus Christ in our heart and in our fellow men we also meet ourselves. True knowledge of one self is absolutely connected to the knowledge of God in the person of Jesus Christ. Hence we find that also our self-knowledge is dépendent on subject-sub ject relations, the relations between human persons, of whom Christ is the first. Through him we have our relation to God. birds of heaven, the cattle, all wild animais on earth, and ail reptiles that crawl upon the earth". (This and the following quotations are taken from the New English Bible). ^ Compare Genesis 1,26-28; 5,1; 9,6 with Genesis 5,3: "Adam ... begot a son in his likeness and image, and named him Seth". This can hardly mean anything else but Seth's destina tion to become the successor or deputy of Adam as the religious head of mankind. The genealogy of Jésus, God's son, in Luke 3,23-38, ends with: "... son of Seth, son of Adam, son of God". Also this can only have a religious meaning. Clearly, being the image of God is closely conneaed to being the son of God. The unity of mankind, personalized first by Adam, later by Jésus Christ, is not primarily given by its having a common ancestor, but because all people are children of God.</page><page sequence="23">BHNG HUMAN IN THE COSMOS 123 2.8. Conclusion If we accept that science is fully human activity, and also that humanity belongs in every respect to the created world, we can easily conclude that science has its limits, to wit the limits of the cosmos. Because she or he be longs to the cosmos no person is able to transcend the cosmic boundaries. Yet not everybody will accept this conclusion. It is a temptation, for instance, and frequent occurrence to suppose that logic and mathematics do not belong to the cosmos. They are supposed to contain eternal truths, because they are tautological, and empirically empty. It is said, for instance, that God could have created the world in many different ways as long as the resuit is not self-contradictory - God considered subject to logical laws. Descartes said it a bit more subtly. He said that God could perhaps have created a world in which two plus two does not make four, but then he, Descartes, would not have been able to understand that world. Put otherwise: mathematics and logic constitute unalienable aspects of our cosmos, and we cannot do without them. According to Calvin, God is neither subject to laws, nor does he act arbitrarily. With this remark Calvin distantiated himself on the one hand from Scholastic rationalism, stating that God is subject to rationality, on the other hand from contemporary voluntarism, in which God's sovereignty was absolutized to complete arbitrariness. Apparently Calvin meant to say that God created the world in an orderly way, lawful, and moreover that he maintains the laws. This means that the world is rational indeed, and is thus fit to be investigated. But Calvin also implied that the idea of God being almighty, and therefore being able to do anything, is spéculative. It means that not only space and time are created together with the whole concrete reality (such as astrophysics implies nowa days with respect to physical space and time), but also mathematics and rationality. Accepting this radical view we should be careful not to apply mathematics and logic to situations outside the cosmos, to God himself, or to whatever preceded the beginning of the cosmos. Not only our physical insights, but also our mathematics and logic are altogether insufficiënt to understand that beginning, and whatever preceded it. In the third part of this paper we shall find occasion to say more about the boundaries of the cosmos. Dooyeweerd states there does not exist a single "kingdom" or "radical type" of human beings, qualified by a single modal aspect Humanity is cha racterized by the fact that it transcends ail modal boundaries. Instead we recognize a large number of kingdoms, in which people act in various ways, and which are therefore characterized by human activity - for instance, the kingdom of logically qualified structures of theoretical thought, the kingdom of human-made artefacts, the kingdom of all languages (qualified by, but to be distinguished from the lingual aspect), the kingdom of all social communities, the kingdom of all states and their légal parts, and so forth. We have discussed some aspects of the position of human beings in the cosmos. We emphasized that human beings are part and parcel of the cos mos, in particular of the so-called natural kingdoms, but distinguish them</page><page sequence="24">124 M. D. STAFIEU selves from animais by transcending the na tu ral kingdoms as well. This does not mean that humanity is able to transcend the boundaries of the cosmos. In order to have true knowledge of God it is sufficiënt to address oneself to Christ, who came into the worid to become a subject to creational law, a true brother of any human person. 3. Humanlty in the history of the cosmos In Part 3 of this paper we shall turn our attention to the history of the cosmos. This history may be divided in a first, very large part (the natural évolution before the rise of humanity), and a second part (the history of mankind), which is relatively short, such that apparently the natural évolution has halted. The development of humanity during its existence took place at an accelerating pace. We shall mostly pay attention to the first part, and the transition to the second one. 3.1. Time as horizon "Time" as intended both in colloquial language and in the sciences is mere ly a part of a set of relations between ail things and events, their structures and their modal relations. The totality of relations and the order to which they are subjected we call "cosmic time". It is an idea, an extension of the common concept of "time" in a narrower sense. Presently we shall discuss the boundaries of the cosmos, arguing that these are determined by cosmic time. Whenever our sight is not hampered by houses, trees or mountains the horizon marks the end of our sight. We know that the horizon is partly determined by our stand. By climbing a hill we change our horizon. We discover that the horizon is the end of our sight, but not the end of the world. Analogously, we speak of the horizon of our experience, which is just as plastic, because it is individually and culturally determined. The horizon of cosmic time is less individual, yet it is plastic. The whole création is restricted in time, conceived as the network of ail possible relations between ail possible créatures. Because reality evolves, the horizon of time expands. The dimensions of the horizon of time include past, present and future. The past leaves its traces, and the investigation of these traces provides us with insight into the évolution of the cosmos. Paleontological studies of various strata and fossils taught us a lot about the évolution of our planet and the developing kingdoms of plants and animais. The évolution of the sun is mirrored in the state of the stars which are either younger or older. The history of humanity is recovered by archeological and historical research. The availability of written records is most important for our historical horizon. In astrophysics, the idea of a horizon has recently become relevant After the so-called big bang, i.e., the beginning of the development of the physical universe, the universe expands like a balloon. As a resuit ail galaxies move away from each other. Astronomers are able to détermine both the dis</page><page sequence="25">BONG HUMAN IN THE COSMOS 125 tances and the speeds of the galaxies. It turns out that the most remote systems move fastest. Now the light reaching us from these galaxies needs time to reach us. Hence the picture we gain of them relates to states of affairs of a long time ago. The most distant systems are at the spatial horizon of the physical universe, and what we see of them shows events dating from shortly after the big bang. This marks the horizon of cosmic time in its spatial, kinematic and physical aspects. It has become clear that the proper beginning of the astrophysical évolu tion remains behind this horizon forever. With the help of their théories based on observations, astrophysicists explore the possibility of coming very close to the big bang. But they realize that they can never reach that beginning. The theory aims to describe the évolution after the big bang, not the big bang itself. It should be observed that the big bang had better not be identified with the création in the beginning of the cosmos in a biblical sense, which is not primarily the création of matter out of nothing, but the ordering of the cosmos, making possible the coming into being of ail created things, plants, animais, and ultimately people. According to astrophysics, the évolution since the big bang occurs accor ding to laws that we (at least partly) know from our present-day experience. The extrapolation towards the past is based on the supposition that these laws have a constant validity. 3-2. The first living beings In its biotic aspect too the cosmos is bounded by time. Elsewhere I have argued that the biotic subject-subject relation is characterized by descen dence, the genetic relation.45 The genetic law states that every living being descends from one or more other living beings. Consequently, the question of how the first living being came into existence cannot be answered by biology alone. There is clearly no biotic relation between the first living being and whatever preceded it. It may very well be that the beginning of the biotic cosmos remains forever behind the biotic horizon, characterized by the very beginning of life in its concrete manifestations. Speaking about the "biotic cosmos" does not mean that it has a separate existence from the physical cosmos. It can hardly be doubted that the world of living beings arose from the physical world, even if we do not know how, and even if this would forever remain beyond the scope of our knowledge. Dooyeweerd46 reasons that biotic being cannot arise from biotic non-being, which sounds Parmenidian. On the contrary, I contend that the rise of the biotic cosmos is consistent with the view that the création is primarily ordering, not création out of nothing. The coming into existence of the first living beings means the manifestation of biotic laws at a time when the circumstances allowed it. 45 Sufleu op. cit. (b), chapter 8; (0 ^ Dooyeweerd op. cit (b), 126ff.</page><page sequence="26">126 M. D. STAFLEU In his extensive review of Lever*s Creatie en evolutie Dooyeweerd pro posed to practise an attitude of "learned ignorance" with respect to the pro blem of the coming into existence of living beings.47 It is improbable that Dooyeweerd did not realize that this term was used by the fifteenth-century philosopher and theologian Nicholas of Cuse (and even earlier by Augustine). In 1440, Nicholas wrote De docta ignorantia, On learned ignorance. He argued that it is the aim of ail science to determine the measure of all things, the mathematical relation to other things. However, there is no measure of the infinité, and God being infinité is unknowable. I don't think it was Dooyeweerd's intention to accept this view, if only because in the present context he was not concemed with the knowledge of God, but with our insight in the coming into existence of plants, animais, and humans. He had too much respect for the sciences, realizing that all human knowledge is fallible. The Philosophy of the Cosmonomic Idea assumes that reality is fundamentally knowable. lts lawfulness investigated by science is based in the création, which is subject to laws given by God and maintained by him according to his covenanL The possibility to gain reliable knowledge of the world rests on this ground. We can safely agree with Nicholas of Cuse that there is no autonomous road to the knowledge of God. Even for the knowledge of the cosmos huma nity dépends on investigation. Every scientist is bound to the states of affairs which he finds in reality. Dooyeweerd had no intention to use the docta ignorantia thesis to dis crédit the results of science. The positivist view that science merely puts hypotheses, and that any set of hypotheses can always be replaced by an equivalent one is sometimes employed by Christians who feel threatened by scientific results. Within the framework of our philosophy this loophole is useless, however. To acquiesce in the docta ignorantia thesis is an argument of embarrass ment. The above formulated assumption that the beginning of the astro physical and biotic évolution is hidden behind the horizon of cosmic time has a higher philosophical, i.e., explicative quality. Dooyeweerd refused to accept that the rise of the various kingdoms can only be explained on a theological basis, i.e., by special création. Dooye weerd maintained that there does not exist any création within the horizon of cosmic time. From the beginning the cosmos contained the possibility for the development of plants, animais and humans, even if its realization (the process of becoming, according to Dooyeweerd) is a matter of time. 3 3· A philosophical account of évolution It might very well be possible to account for the coming into existence of the first plants and animais in a philosophical way. Evidently, this is widely different from a scientific explanation. Even if the problem of the rise of the first living beings can never be solved in a scientific way, a philosophical System like Dooyeweerd's cannot avoid the question of how to give a philo 47 Dooyeweerd op. cit (b), 156-157.</page><page sequence="27">BEING HUMAN IN THE COSMOS 127 sophical account of the successive realization of the various kingdoms. No serious philosophy would consider a supematural deed of God, an act of création in the course of time, as a scientific explanation. The temporal relations of reality include the modal retrocipations and anticipations. An important part of the development of the création con cerns the graduai opening up of the anticipations. The study of the modal aspects, and of the kingdoms qualified by them, allows us to identify and study these anticipations. It is a typical Dooyeweerdian thesis that the development of the antici pations in a certain modal aspect can only occur "under the guidance" of a later aspect48 This is a dark and even mythical statement A guiding role can only be attributed to individuals or groups of individuals, not to aspects. But Dooyeweerd's intention is suffidently clear from the context. Thus he states that the "bio-molecules* having a physical-chemical struc ture anticipating the biotic functioning of a cell can only exist within the structure of a living cell. This is an old and often repeated thesis. Unfor tunately, it is not altogether dear what kind of molecules is meanL Every time one is identified saentists succeed in producing it sooner or later outside a living cell. Hence it may be wondered if the thesis is righL In fact it has no empirical or theoretical ground, and it seems to be as spéculative as its reversai. At least we should investigate the possibility that under specified circumstances the anticipations of certain structures would develop such that the emergence of new structures would be possible. We should include the possibility that these "circumstances* are such that they are not experimentally reprodu dble, for instance, because they would need a very long time. This is not altogether spéculative. For physically qualified structures an analogical possibility is not only theoretically but even experimentally esta blished. The structure of électrons and similar partides differs very much from that of photons, yet électrons emerge from photons spontaneously. 3.4. The irreducibility of the modal aspects The Philosophy of the Cosmonomic Idea is able to account for this phenomenon by pointing to the distinction between law and subject Even if in certain circumstances électrons are absent, the structural law for électrons is valid. When the circumstances are favourable, electrons can emerge under conditions determined by this structural law. The thesis that there is no law without subjects should not be inteφreted to mean that the subjects should always actually exist Every law has potential subjects besides actual ones. The law is not only valid at present, but also in the future. Thus we can maintain that the laws for life, learning, distinguishing, namegiving, etc., existed long before living beings existed, and the same 48 Dooyeweerd op. ciL (b), 128-129: "... zgn. Wo-chemische en frfo-physische processen, waarin de organische levensfunctie zelve de leidende en richtende rol vervult." (... the so called hiochemical and bfophysical processes, in which the organic fonction of life itself has a guiding and directional part.) Dooyeweerd stresses that an explanation for the rise of living beings through physical and chemical processes only would contradia his philosophy, in particular the view that the biotic aspea is irreducible to the physical one.</page><page sequence="28">128 M. D. STAFLEU applies to learning, distinguishing, or name-giving beings. The graduai deve lopment of the cosmos would have been impossible if otherwise. According to this principle research into the rise of the first living beings is conduaed. With the help of geological and paleontological facts one tries to establish the circumstances under which the first living beings manifested themselves. It cannot be denied that much spéculation surrounds this kind of research, but that does not condemn iL In describing the development of the universe over billions of years, astrophysics too assumes the validity of laws which have been found from contemporary experience. The lawfulness we discover in nature and in our laboratories we apply to happenings which we did not observe. The distinction between law and subject allows us to meet a possible objection against our views as developed so fax. It is the objection that évolu tion erases the idea of the mutual irreducibility of the various modal aspects. If the coming into existence of the first living beings would be a natural process, would that not imply that the biotic aspect is reducible to the physi cal one, alter all ? I don't think so. As soon as the processes started that ultimately resulted in the coming into existence of living beings, the biotic laws became oper ative, as a new order, i.e., as an order irreducible to the physical one. The order in any living cell has a biotic character. In fact, from a physical point of view, cells are merely accidentai aggregates of molecules, with no physical ordering above the molecular level. Even the structure of wood (i.e., "dead" matter) can only be understood with the help of biotic laws. Hence the assumption that the évolution of living beings from non-living material is a natural process, according to natural laws, does not imply that we should reject the mutual irreducibility of the biotic and the physical modal aspects. That would only be the case if we assumed that the emergence of living beings can be explained with the help of physical-chemical laws only. Mutatis mutandis similar remarks can be made with respect to the emer gence of the animal world. 3 5. Evolution witbin the biotic kingdom If the hypothesis that descendence is the fundamental biotic subject subject relation is right, the universality of the biotic aspect implies that the family relation includes ail living beings, past, present and future. If there would be no genetic relation between the individual members of various genera or orders, then these would form as many different biotic kingdoms. This is the philosophical foundation of the theory of évolution, which the biotic theory of évolution attempts to account for. The fact that so far empirically founded théories explaining the évolution of various genera, orders and families have not been successful does not detract from the fact that the kingdom of all living beings is a biotically qualified kingdom, for which a philosophical system like the Philosophy of the Cosmonomic Idea should account. We do not know how one genus has evolved from another one. We do not even know what conditions determine the stability of biotic structures. But we cannot doubt that if an explanation is</page><page sequence="29">BHNG HUMAN IN THE COSMOS 129 found, it will be a natural one, in conformity with laws laid down by the creator of the world.49 3-6. Evolution in tbe animal kingdom For the détermination of the position of humanity in the cosmos it is crucial to rethink the évolution within the animal kingdom. Most important seems to be the development of the vertebrates, which since the Cambrium display a succession of jawless animais, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. Further research along our suggestion made above with respect to the subjective functioning of animais in the post-psychical aspects could lead to surprising results for anthropology. In the animal kingdom, too, évolution means a graduai, sometimes step wise development of possibilities which have been laid down in the création from the beginning. It would be highly interesting to find out if the (retro cipatory) functioning of animais in the post-psychic aspects was subject to évolution. Unfortunatelv. behaviour cannot be fossilized. 3.7. The position of bumanity in cultural bistory The récognition of good and evil, the challenge of responsibility, marks the beginning of culture. This implies that the coming into existence of man kind cannot be traced in any scientific way, neither biologically nor culturally. The opening up of the psychic and post-psychic aspects, as well as the development of the kingdoms of humanity, is of eminent importance for the understanding of history. For instance, the tremendous growth of the indivi dual memory of men and in particular the collective memory of mankind by the development of written language, the invention of printing, libraries and other bearers of information marks the pace of history. Education in the family and in schools is to a large extern directed to the appropriation of the entry to the collective memory of mankind. In the cultural development the normative character of the law side of reality comes to the fore. That is one reason why one hesitates sometimes to call the natural évolution "history". It is certainly meaningful to maintain a distinction between natural évolution and cultural history. At least it has more meaning than to maintain a distinction between natural and normative modal aspects. In particular one should distinguish the cultural development of humanity from the biotic and psychic évolution within the kingdoms of plants and animais. The equivocation of the two processes means to fall into the trap of evolutionism. Incidentally, it would be just as wrong to confuse the astro physical évolution with the biotic one. The First is determined by physical laws, the latter by biotic ones. 3 8. The buman I The search for the position of a human being in the cosmos should be 49 For more details, sec Sufleu op. cit (b) Sec 8.4 and (0 Sec 9.</page><page sequence="30">130 M. D. STAFLEU part of a discussion of the destiny of mankind, the meaning of reality, the unity of the création and in particular of all human beings, their personality and character, their self-knowledge, and their relation to their true or assumed Origin. I have hardly touched on these questions, mainly because these are less often neglected than those related to the évolution of humanity. But of course they are not less important, and implied in our discussion. It would be utterly wrong to relate the religious character of humanity exclusively to questions of destiny, unity and origin. I have tried to make clear that also the position of a human being in the cosmos is religiously deter mined. This follows from the transcendental character of the functioning of a person in the modal aspects, from the relevance of the récognition of good and evil with respect to the position of mankind in the natural and cultural kingdoms, and from the normative positioning of a human being in cultural history. In this context it would be necessary to pay much more attention to the structure of the human body, the spirit, and the self. This would indude a much-needed reflection on the distinction of man and woman, and on the distinction between the various phases of human life. The individuality of every person, the "self* or "I", is the nodal focus of all relations between human beings and their fellow men and women, their environment, and their creator and redeemer.50 To ignore these relations would, if possible, inevitably lead to getting lost in time. General Conclusion In pursuance of the discussion on anthropology in the context of Calvinian philosophy I have posed some questions regarding the position of human persons in the cosmos. It will be clear that I have been proposing more problems than providing solutions. My aim was to investigate why (in my view) the anthropology debate of the past years has borne so little fruit This paper explores some new roads for the development of a Christian anthropology, in particular, but not exclusively, from a natural scientific point of view. Starting from Dooyeweerd's theory of cosmic time, Section 1 points out the relevance of the modal subject-subject relations for an understanding of the position of human beings in the cosmos. An analysis of the subject subject relations in each modal aspect, and their analogies with respect to the other aspects, is a necessary prerequisite for the establishment of a temporal reference system which enables us to détermine the position of individual persons in the cosmos. For each modal aspect the relevant subject-subject relation is briefly and provisionally indicated. Some problems with respect to such an analysis are mentioned, including difficulties concerning the order of the post-psychic modal aspects, a person's oppositional attitude to the création and his or her fellows, the instrumental character of opened up subject-subject relations, the functio ning of social institutes as modal subjects, the openness of mankind and the 5° Cf. Stafleu op.ciL (b), 37. The human self is aLso called the "soul* or the "heart", and must be distinguished from the "spirit" or the "mind" as discussed in Sec. 2.5.</page><page sequence="31">BHNG HUMAN IN THE COSMOS 131 need for specialization, the transformation of laws into positive norms, and the transcendental character of humanity. In Section 2 we discussed the position of a person within the "kingdoms": the astrophysical cosmos, the biosphere of the earth, the kingdom of animais, and briefly, the cultural kingdoms. In particular attention was paid to the distinction between humans and animais. Although taking part in the kingdom of animais, a person transcends it because of his or her calling as a responsible being, to promote the good and to combat the evil. Whereas animais are functioning in the post-psychic modal aspects in a closed (retro cipatory, instinctive) way, mankind has disclosed ail modal aspects in a nnrmotivp cpncp In Section 3 we discussed the position of humanity in history. Using the idea of the horizon of time an attempt is made to understand why some problems concerning the origin of the astrophysical cosmos, of the first living beings, and of the first human beings, will probably for always remain out of reach of the sciences. Finally, we indicated how the natural and cultural évolution of the cosmos can possibly be accounted for within the frame work of the Philosophy of the Cosmonomic Idea. And this is of the uppermost importance. This philosophy should never acquiesce in the image of a static system of modal aspects and idionomic structures, which will be its fate if it fails to account for the dynamics of the création. If we want to avoid this trap we shall have to consider "création" and "development" (both natural évolution and cultural history) not as contrary but as complementary ideas in our philosophy.51 51 Earlier versions of this paper have been read by Dr. R.
