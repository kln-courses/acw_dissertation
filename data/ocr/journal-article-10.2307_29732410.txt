<plain_text><page sequence="1">Immediate enterai feeding after gastrointestinal resection Tests of intestinal permeability were inadequate Editor,?Cornelia S Carr and colleagues report a trial with the important message that early enterai feeding after major surgery is both pos? sible and safe.1 Their conclusion about the changes seen in intestinal permeability is, however, unjustified. Tests of intestinal permeability were per? formed preoperatively and on day 5 postopera tively. No significant change was found in the permeability index (lactulosermannitol absorp? tion ratio) on these two days in the group given early enterai feeding. This does not mean, however, that no rise occurred in this index: the permeability may have increased but returned to normal by day 5. Wicks et al showed that, after liver transplantation, permeability was increased only on day 1 and had returned to normal on day 3.2 This is corroborated by our preliminary data showing that permeability in a range of patients in an intensive therapy unit may be greatly increased on admission but has returned to nor? mal by day 6 (fig 1). We also question the authors' experimental design and methodology with respect to the per? meability tests. They state that after the test Dag* fmmte ^?;%m Fig 1?Mean (SE) changes in permeability in six patients admitted to general intensive therapy unit BMJ volume 313 27 JULY 1996 229</page><page sequence="2">solution was given "a urine sample was taken 12 to 24 hours later." The conventional test requires a five hour urine collection with measurement of the percentage dose excreted for each sugar. This test assesses only the permeability of the small intestine as in the colon the sugars are degraded by the colonie flora.3 4 The results obtained from a urine sample taken between 12 and 24 hours are likely to be affected by the colonie bacteria, especially if no urine collection was performed. Moreover, the group given early enterai feeding had a nasojejunal tube in situ; the test solution is likely to have entered the colon earlier in this group than in the group fed conventionally as gastric stasis will not affect patients fed nasojeju nally. It could be argued that this in itself could be responsible for the difference in the changes in permeability seen between the two groups. Finally, by not standardising the timing of the urine sample the authors may have introduced potential errors and bias.

Study was not sufficiently rigorous Editor,?Cornelia S Carr and colleagues have added to the evidence that enterai nutrition may be started soon after gastrointestinal surgery.1 The importance of anticipating the need for postoperative nutritional support cannot be underestimated, particularly when postoperative complications may delay oral intake. The content of this paper fails, however, to support its title and the key points listed. The nature of the procedures that the patients underwent is not stated; sepsis was scored but the scores are not given. Both factors would influence the degree of postoperative stress and hence the nutritional markers. Moreover, the nature of the surgical procedure might affect the time to the return of gastrointestinal motility and therefore tolerance of enterai nutrition and the incidence of diarrhoea and vomiting. Preopera tive nutritional status was not assessed but is surely relevant. It is suggested that the patients fed enterally experienced less morbidity. The complications described were heterogeneous and seem not to have been denned at the start of the study. Enterai feeding is said to have been associ? ated with improved nutritional status, but this is not borne out by the variables reported. It is inappropriate to quote a mean change in skinfold thickness of 0.05 cm, given the lack of precision and wide interobserver and intraobserver vari? ability in anthropomorphic assessment. The assumption that serum albumin concentration is a nutritional marker is incorrect.2 Finally, the authors imply that the presence of malnutrition was related to the incidence of sepsis in the study by Fong et al3 and that the work of Johnson et al suggested that intravenous nutrition prolonged ileus.4 Neither study supports these statements. The benefit of early enterai nutrition on outcome after orthopaedic surgery has been shown.5 To confirm those findings after gastrointestinal surgery will require more rigorous studies than this.

Fluid regimen given to control group is increasingly being abandoned Editor,?Having read Cornelia S Carr and col? leagues' paper on their trial of immediate postoperative enterai feeding in patients under? going gastrointestinal resection, I question the fluid regimen given to the control patients, who were kept nil by mouth until the passage of flatus.1 Such a regimen has been increasingly abandoned because randomised trials have shown that the immediate introduction of oral fluids after laparotomy (including bowel resec? tion) is not associated with a higher rate of com? plications or fluid and electrolyte imbalances but does improve patients' comfort and allows earlier discharge.2"4 Gastric activity returns 24 hours after laparotomy, and only about 2% of patients require nasogastric drainage.5 The mucosal protection associated with enterai nutrition could have been achieved more simply, cheaply, and comfortably by allowing patients to drink at will in the postoperative period.

Serum albumin concentration is not a marker of nutritional status Editor,?In their paper on postoperative enterai feeding in patients undergoing bowel resection Cornelia S Carr and colleagues used serum albumin concentrations as one of six markers of nutritional status.1 Doweiko and Nompleggi and Klein show that although protein energy malnutri? tion causes a decrease in the rate of synthesis of albumin, this has little impact on albumin concen? trations because of albumin's low rate of turnover and large pool size.2 3 Even during chronic malnu? trition, serum albumin concentration is maintained because of a compensatory decrease in the degradation of albumin and transfer of extravascu lar albumin to the intravascular compartment. Hence the serum albumin concentration changes little in patients with anorexia nervosa. Although inadequate nutrition may contribute to low serum albumin concentrations in patients in hospital, the metabolic response to stress?for example, surgery and disease?is a far more important factor. In such "inflammatory stress" states, synthesis of albumin decreases and degrada? tion and transcapillary losses of albumin increase. Disruption of the normal ratio between body com? partments alone will change the serum albumin concentration. Hence, in Carr and colleagues' study I would not expect the serum albumin concentration to have differed between the groups fed enterally and conventionally unless their meta? bolic response to surgery differed.

Nevertheless, the striking difference at day 5 between the patients managed conventionally and those fed enterally is surely noteworthy. S M Gabe and DBA Silk's figure shows that intestinal permeability had normalised by day 6 in their series of six patients in an intensive therapy unit. The authors do not mention outcome, so they may be interested to learn that in one study intestinal permeability remained increased in non-survivors but returned to normal in survivors of intensive care (T W Evans, Royal Brompton Hospital, personal communication). We agree that the permeability test assesses small bowel function and absorption, so we fail to see the relevance of colonie bacterial degradation of the sugars. We know of no data showing that this affects either interpretation of the test or the sugar ratio in the urine. The purpose of measuring a ratio of at least two sugars is to circumvent problems related to gastric stasis and other extraneous factors; furthermore, the timing need not be fixed to a conventional five hour collection.1 N J Everitt requests more data; unfortunately, space constraints required our original submission to be reduced to a maximum of 1000 words (and this response to a maximum of 400 words). By necessity, details had to be removed?for example, the fact that complications were defined at the out? set. We will gladly supply further details on request. Everitt's remarks about two of our references is correct in that they were accidentally transposed, but Everitt reads too much into our study; we did not make any claims regarding benefit (which would require a much larger study) but simply showed safety and efficacy. Sudip Ray argues for oral fluids to be given immediately after laparotomy; we do not disagree, but old habits die hard and traditional postoperative starvation is still common. Finally, Emma Chojnowska queries our use of serum albumin concentration as one of six mark? ers of nutritional status; we readily accept that it is better used as a marker of inflammation.
