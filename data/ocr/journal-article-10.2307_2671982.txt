The Truthmaker Argument for States of Affairs Assuming that there are particulars and universals, and that the connections be- tween the two sorts of entity are logically contingent, one can mount a strong argument for a third sort of entity, states of affairs. A recent example is the 'truth- maker argument' Armstrong deploys in his A World of States of Affairs.' Sup- pose it is contingently true that a is F, that particular a instantiates universal F-ness, but that there is no logical necessity that it do so. One may then rea- sonably ask: What is it about the world that makes it the case that a is F? What is the truthmaker, or ontological ground, of this truth? The truthmaker cannot be a taken by itself, at least not if a is a 'thin' particular, a particular consid- ered apart from its properties. (A 'thick' particular, a particular taken together with its properties, is itself a state of affairs.) Nor can the truthmaker be the pair of a and F-ness. For a and F-ness could both exist without it being the case that a is F. (If universals cannot exist unexemplified, as Armstrong maintains, F-ness could exist by being instantiated elsewhere, in b, say.) It seems that a further entity is needed to serve as the truthmaker of 'a is F.' According to Arm- strong, the obvious candidate is the state of affairs, a's being F. Armstrong of course realizes that an argument for truthmakers is not automatically an argu- ment for states of affairs as truthmakers; but given the rest of his ontology, states of affairs are the only sort of entity that could do the truthmaking job. I will follow him in assuming that states of affairs alone can serve as truthmakers. It should be obvious that these truthmaking states of affairs are concrete entities, facts, all of which exist or obtain; they are not to be confused with abstract states of affairs which either obtain or do not obtain depending on how the world is. The latter are themselves in need of something in the world that explains why they obtain.

So given the plausible principle that contingent truths require truthmakers, one can argue that an on- tology harboring contingently connectable particulars and universals must also harbor states of affairs. 2. What are States of Affairs? The truthmaker argument gives us reason to accept states of affairs (facts), but what exactly are we accepting? What are states of affairs? Nothing in the truth- maker argument dictates how exactly we should conceive of them. It will emerge that there are three theoretically possible conceptions of states of affairs de- pending on how we account for the unity of their constituents. The datum from which we start is that a state of affairs or fact, however con- ceived, is more than its primary constituents since they can exist without it ex- isting.2 Even if a and F-ness cannot exist except in some state of affairs or other, there is nothing in the nature of a and nothing in the nature of F-ness to require that they combine with each other to form a's being F. So something more is needed to connect them. The problem is to specify the nature of this connector or unifier of a fact's constituents. What could it be? There are exactly three possibilities only the first two of which have re- ceived any 'press.' Either the connector is (i) internal to the state of affairs, i.e., is a secondary constituent of it that 'ties' the primary constituents 'into' a state of affairs; or (ii) the connector is the state of affairs itself; or (iii) the connector is external to the state of affairs. Corresponding to (i) is the reductionist con- ception of states of affairs as analyzable without remainder into their (primary and secondary) constituents. Corresponding to (ii) is the nonreductionist con- ception of states of affairs as irreducible entities distinct from their constitu- ents. Corresponding to (iii) is the hitherto unexplored conception of states of affairs as complexes whose constituents are united by a unifier distinct from the state of affairs and its constituents. What I plan to argue is that there are excellent reasons for rejecting both op- tion (i) and option (ii), and thus reasons for exploring option (iii). My thesis could also be expressed as follows. If (i) and (ii) are the only possibilities, then the concept of a state of affairs is incoherent, and the truthmaker argument for states of affairs, despite its great intuitive appeal, is unsound. 3. The Connector as Internal to States of Affairs Corresponding to (i) is the view, call it reductionist, according to which states of affairs are analyzable without remainder into their constituents. The locus classicus of this approach is Bergmann's Realism.3 'Constituents' here includes both primary and secondary constituents; no one could reasonably hold that a</page><page sequence="3">States of Affairs 239 state of affairs reduces to its primary constituents alone. The reductionist view has quite a lot to recommend it as the following argument shows. It is obvious that (P1) there is more to a's being F than a and F-ness; a and F-ness can both exist without constituting a fact. But (P2) there cannot be anything more to a complex such as a fact or state of affairs than its constituents. Equivalently, if two complexes differ, they differ in a constituent. Therefore, (C) the 'some- thing more,' the 'togetherness' of particular and universal must be, or must be grounded in, a further constituent of the fact, a relation of instantiation or nexus of exemplification. On this reductionist approach, one accounts for the differ- ence between a s being F and the sum a + F-ness4 (and also the difference be- tween the state of affairs and the membership or extension of the set {a, F-ness}) by positing a further ontological ingredient in the state of affairs that ties the others together. It is important to appreciate how strong and natural this argument is. P1 is self-evident. But given the sort of analytic ontology presupposed here, P2 also seems well-nigh self-evident. If a complex is built up out of simpler elements, how could there be anything more to a complex than these elements? A strict adherence to the analytical ideal bids us construe every feature of a complex, and every difference between two complexes, as grounded in a constituent. But then C follows and the unifier or connector of a and F-ness is a further constit- uent of a s being F. But all is not well: the reductionist approach faces a serious objection, which is the sound core of F. H. Bradley's famous regress argument against external relations. The core idea (roughly) is that once you analyze a fact into its con- stituents, you destroy its unity and will never be able to reconstitute it by add- ing constituents. A fact is a contingent unity of constituents, and this contingent unity can never be explained analytically by attempting to ground the unity in a special unifying constituent. Ontological analysis reaches a limit here.5 Unity eludes analytic understanding, understanding which proceeds by moving from whole to part, from complex to simple. Thus the unity of a's being F cannot be explained by saying that the connector EX (exemplification) connects a and F-ness, for the unity of a, F-ness and EX is just as much in need of explanation as the unity of a and F-ness. Bradley's point is rock-solid, but easily misunderstood, so it will be worth- while to spend some ink on a catalog of misunderstandings. Bradley's point is essentially that for x and y to be related by dyadic relation R, there must be a distinct triadic relation R* to relate x, y, and R. And so on into a regress both infinite and vicious.6 It is clear that the argument applies not only to relational facts ordinarily so-called but also to monadic ones since if an individual has a property, and properties are universals, the individual is in some sense or other 'related' to the property.? Thus for a and F-ness to be related by the dyadic ex- emplification relation EX, there must be a distinct triadic exemplification rela- tion EX* to relate a, F-ness, and EX, etc. What Bradley wants to conclude is that "a relational way of thought-any one that moves by the machinery of terms</page><page sequence="4">240 NO US and relations-must give appearance, and not truth."8 Now we needn't acqui- esce in this conclusion; we may take the regress to show merely that the unity of a fact's primary constituents cannot be explained by any further constituent. In rebuttal of Bradley the following moves have been tried: (1) deny that a (dyadic) relation is a third thing between its terms; (2) deny that exemplifica- tion is a relation; (3) deny that there is an infinite regress; (4) deny that there is a vicious regress. All of these moves involve a misunderstanding of the real thrust of Bradley's argument as I will now show. 1. According to Brand Blanshard, Bradley's mistake is that, misled by a metaphor, He is thinking of a relation as if it were another term, as if A-R-B were three beads on a string ... But R is not the same sort of being as its terms. It is neither a thing nor a quality. It is a relation, and the business of a relation is to relate.9 To evaluate this oft-made objection, we need to distinguish two different senses of "The business of a relation is to relate." On one reading it is false, on the other it doesn't stop the regress. The slogan could mean that (i) the very being of a relation is its actually relating the very terms it does in fact relate. Thus supposing external R relates a and b only, the point would be that the being of R is exhausted in relating a and b. But this would imply that R could not relate any other pair of relata, that it is essential to R that it relate just those terms. This is entirely too strong a reading of the slogan. For one thing, it would imply that no relation that just happens to relate exactly two things is a universal. Secondly, we surely don't want to say that a relation that relates a and b, by its very nature as a relation, could not have related any other pair. That would contradict the fact that R is external to its terms. On the weaker reading, "The business of a relation is to relate" says that (ii) there are no unexemplified relations, that a relation cannot exist without actually relating some relata. Accordingly, dyadic R cannot exist unless it is exemplified by some pair or other, but its existence does not depend on its being exemplified by any particular pair. This weaker reading is very plau- sible, but note that it doesn't stop the regress. For now R is sufficiently like a third term to cause a problem. For the weaker reading allows that a relation is more than its relating of specific relata; it is a universal capable of entering into different relational facts. But if a relation does not necessarily have the terms it has, if it is a contingent fact that R relates a and b, Bradley's problem legiti- mately arises: what is the ontological ground of the difference between aRb and the mere sum, a + R + b? If further relations are introduced to connect R to its terms, a vicious infinite regress ensues. Or at least, nothing that Blanshard says shows that this is not the case. Here is the place to note briefly David Seargent's suggestion that universals are ways for individuals to exist rather than entities to which they are related.'0 As Seargent correctly notes, on a conception of properties as ways, Bradley's regress cannot arise.1" Unfortunately, the conceptions of properties as univer-</page><page sequence="5">States of Affairs 241 sals and as ways pull in opposite directions. For how could a universal, a re- peatable, be a way in the manner required to block Bradley? Suppose that a is red, b is merely possibly red, and redness is a universal. Redness exists since a is (actually) red. But redness is not a way b exists since b is merely possibly red. At most, redness is a way b could exist. Hence there is a difference between b's being red and the sum, b + redness. The existence of b + redness does not entail the existence of b s being red. This gap is suffi- cient to give rise to Bradley's problem. Something additional is needed to make redness a way for b actually to be as opposed to a way for it possibly to be. Something more is needed to tie redness to b. My criticism of Seargent may be summed up as follows. Properties con- strued as ways block Bradley only if (i) properties are particulars individuated by the things that have them, or (ii) properties are universals which are neces- sarily instantiated by the individuals that instantiate them. But if properties are universals only contingently instantiated by the individuals that instantiate them, then talk of them as ways for individuals to exist does nothing more than un- derscore the fact that universals cannot exist uninstantiated.12 But this is not enough to defuse the Bradley regress. 2. The question thus remains: What is the difference between the relational fact aRb and the mere sum, a + R + b? The difference, one might respond, is that in the fact aRb, R is exemplified by a and b, but exemplification is not a relation. Thus it is admitted-contra #1 above-that if exemplification were a relation, there would be a regress; but it is not a relation, so there is no regress. Accordingly, one might hold with Bergmann that exemplification is a nonrela- tional tie or nexus where "A nexus does not need a further entity to tie it to what it ties...13 Exemplification ties directly. But this move won't work ei- ther. It mislocates (dislocates?) the bone of contention. For let it be granted that exemplification is a nonrelational tie or nexus, call it NEX, and that this nexus does not spawn a regress. There will remain the problem of accounting for the difference between a's being F and the sum, a + F-ness + NEX. Thus the prob- lem is not primarily one of blocking a regress, but one of ensuring the lunity of a fact's constituents. If you try to do this with exemplification relations, you get for your trouble a vicious infinite regress. But if you try to do it with a non- relational tie, you avoid the regress, but are left with the unity problem. It might be thought that the unity problem cannot arise on Bergmann's ap- proach. For if NEX is not a relation (being a nonrelational tie), it is not a uni- versal. And if it is not a universal, then it is a particular, in which case there would seem to be no difference between a's being F and a + NEX + F-ness. The mere existence of a, F-ness, and their nonrelational togetherness would en- sure the existence of a's being F.14 This attempt to save Bergmann from the unity problem fails. Although NEX is not a universal strictly speaking, it has the "one-many feature." 15 Since NEX is the same in every fact, the nonrelational togethernesses of a and F-ness, and of b and G-ness, are grounded in the same entity. NEX is therefore sufficiently</page><page sequence="6">242 NOUS like a universal to generate the unity problem. Since there is nothing in the very nature of NEX to ensure that it connects any two or more things it does in fact connect, what accounts for the difference between a's being F and a + F-ness + NEX? The unity problem remains. It is easy to misunderstand the exact sense of the unity problem. The ques- tion, What accounts for the difference between a's being F and the mereologi- cal sum a + F-ness + NEX? is not a question about the difference in general between fact-unity and sum-unity.16 For I could easily grant that NEX is what accounts for this difference: all and only facts contain the NEX constituent. The question is about the difference between any particular fact such as a's being F and the sum (or the extension or membership of the set) of its primary and sec- ondary constituents.17 If NEX unifies the fact's primary constituents, then no doubt it unifies them into a fact: that is just what NEX (the nonrelational tie of exemplification) is posited to do. The question, however, is whether and how NEX actually does this unifying job. For if you add NEX to a and F-ness, the result is not a fact, but at most a possible fact: you have everything you need for a fact except the actual connecting of a, F-ness and NEX.18 It is precisely this problem that I am highlighting when I ask, What accounts for the differ- ence between a's being F and the mereological sum a + F-ness + NEX? Thus the question does not concern the nature of fact-unity in general, but the exis- tence of fact-unity in particular cases. It may well be that all and only facts are complexes the unifying constituent of which is NEX. But this at most specifies the nature of facts and could be true even if there were no facts. What I am calling the unity problem, however, is a problem about the existence of partic- ular facts. For a fact cannot exist unless its constituents are actually unified. So the unity problem is precisely this: What makes it the case that a number of constituents of the right kinds-constituents which are connectable so as to form a fact but need not be connected to exist-are actually connected so as to form an actual or existing fact? Another way to deny that exemplification is a relation is by going the Fregean route: properties are 'gappy' or 'unsaturated' or 'incomplete' entities that some- how fit together with, and are completed by, individuals without the need for any sort of metaphysical binding agent.19 Exemplification is not a relation, not because it is a nonrelational tie, but because it is not a tie at all. Exemplifica- tion does not exist. But this eliminativist solution won't cut it either. For even if one can make sense of gappy properties, what grounds the difference be- tween a's being F and the mere sum, a + _F, where ' F' denotes a gappy property?20 (Don't forget that we are assuming that properties are universals;2' and don't confuse 'Properties are incomplete' with 'Properties are themselves particulars.') Granting that two constituents can form a unity without the ser- vice of any intermediary item, whether an instantiation relation or a nonrela- tional tie, what makes it the case that they actually do form a unity? To insert a plug (saturated entity) into a socket (unsaturated entity), there is no need for the likes of solder to make a good connection. But from the fact that the con-</page><page sequence="7">States of Affairs 243 nection can be made 'Frege-style,' it doesn't follow that it is made. Something else is needed: an agent who actually inserts the plug into the socket. Similarly, something else is need to account for the difference between the sum, a + _F, and a's being F. Of course, the inserting of a plug into a socket is a causal process; the sat- urating of a gappy property by an individual is not. But the unity problem does not trade on the confusion of causal questions with ontological ones. The prob- lem is that the mere existence of a and F does not entail the existence of a's being F. What then accounts for the difference between the sum a + F and the corresponding fact? It is no answer to say that in the former case a does not saturate _F while in the latter case it does.22 For that merely re-describes the problem. The problem is to specify ontologically what the saturation consists in. It is important to see that this saturation cannot be explained by empirical causation. We cannot say that the unity of a and F-ness is empirically caused by some other state of affairs. For if the relata of the causal relation are states of affairs, as can be plausibly maintained, then the existence of a's being F is a logical precondition of its standing in any causal relation to any other state of affairs. But the existence of a's being F is just the unity or connectedness of a and F-ness; hence whatever it is, if anything, that accounts for the connected- ness of a and F-ness cannot be an empirical cause. To appreciate this, one must see that the question, What accounts for a's be- ing F? is ambiguous as between: What is the empirical cause of a's being F? and What is the ontological ground of the unity of a and F-ness (and thus of the very existence of a's being F and the possibility of its being a causal rela- tuin)? To the first question, one could answer: b's being G. But one cannot give this answer to the second question. Thus the unity problem arises whether we think of exemplification as a re- lation, as a nonrelational tie, or as a 'nonrelational nontie,' i.e., as a gap in a property. Hence we are saddled with the problem whether or not we think of exemplification as a tertium quid 'between' a and F-ness. The problem arises from the circumstance that there is nothing in the natures of a and F-ness to require that they come together (as they would be so required if F-ness were an Aristotelian accident of a); it does not arise because of the presence of a third item 'between' a and F-ness. The postulated third item is not the source of the difficulty, but a (misguided) attempt to solve it. Hence removing it a' la Frege does not remove the difficulty. This point is often overlooked. 3. A third response to Bradley is to hold that exemplification is a relation, but that it does not engender an infinite regress, not even a benign one. Accord- ing to Reinhardt Grossmann, the regress requires the following false assumption: A. Whenever two entities x and y are related to each other, there exists a third entity, the relation R, that relates them. Principle (A), coupled with the assumption that exemplification is a relation, clearly implies an infinite regress for every monadic fact of the form, Fa. Some,</page><page sequence="8">244 NOUS like Grossmann, will take this regress, even if benign, to show that the assump- tion is false. They will insist that relations are in no need of further relations to relate them to what they relate. "Relations are the glue of the world. As such, they need not be glued to what they hold together." 23 It follows that the exem- plification relation does not ignite an infinite regress. But again this misses the point. For let it be granted that if a exemplifies F-ness, it does so without the need of any intermediary relations. What accounts for the difference between a's being F and the mere sum of a + exemplifica- tion + F-ness? In terms of the glue metaphor, it is clear that there is no need of superglue (superduperglue ...) to cement the glue (the superglue ...) to the boards. But the existence of two boards and some glue does not entail the existence of two-boards-glued-together. Something more is needed: the glue has to be ap- plied to the boards, and they have to be brought into contact with one another. Similarly, it is not enough that a, F-ness and the exemplification relation all ex- ist; they have to brought together so as to form a state of affairs. Bradley's point is that this bringing together cannot be accomplished by any constituent of the state of affairs in question. Surely he is right about this. 4. A fourth response to Bradley admits the regress but argues that it is as benign as the truth regress. If proposition p is true, then it is true that p is true, and true that it is true that p is true, ad infinitum. This truth regress (progress?) is clearly benign. For it is obvious that the ground of p's truth is not the truth that p is true, and so on, but the state of affairs that makes p true (assuming p is contingent). And this state of affairs makes every member of the infinite se- ries true. Armstrong's main position, as we will see in the next section, is that there is no need for an instantiation relation to tie particulars and universals into states of affairs. But he has a 'fall-back' position: even if an instantiation relation is admitted, the resulting regress is as harmless as the truth regress.24 His idea is that "while the step from constituents to states of affairs is a contingent one, all the further steps in the suggested regress follow necessarily." 25 What he means is more clearly explained in an earlier publication where he describes the re- gress as follows. I have interpolated numerals into his text for later reference. [1] The particular a instantiates property F. [2] Prima facie, however, instantiation is a universal, found wherever there are things having properties. [3] So this state of affairs, a's instantiating property F, is a token of the type instantiation ... [4] The state of affairs instantiates instantiation. [5] But here we have another token of in- stantiation. [6] So the state of affairs (that state of affairs instantiating instantia- tion) also instantiates instantiation. And so on ad infinitum.26 I think it is clear that this regress, which is structurally similar to the truth regress, is as benign as the latter. But it is not Bradley's regress. Armstrong con- fuses it with Bradley's regress because he confuses the instantiation relation with instantiation relationships.27 So let's first review the crucial distinction be-</page><page sequence="9">States of Affairs 245 tween a relation and a relationship or relatedness. A relationship is a particular relational fact which is nothing apart from its terms, and so cannot exist with- out the terms it in fact has. A relationship is in every case a particular, an un- repeatable. But a relation is a universal that can exist without relating the terms that it happens to relate. Thus Tim's kicking Tom (at a particular time) is a re- lationship, a relational fact, that cannot exist apart from Tim and Tom; but kicks is a universal whose existence does not depend on that of Tim and Tom, though it may depend on the existence of some pair or other. Turning now to Armstrong's text, I will show that Armstrong confuses the instantiation relation with instantiation relationships. Note first that Armstrong is treating the fact that a instantiates F-ness as a unit and claiming that it (rather than its constituents) is a token of the type instantiation. But on this assump- tion, [3] follows from [1] and [2] only on the further assumption that 'instan- tiation' in [3] is short for 'instantiation relationship.' The inference is a non sequitur if the key term is short for 'instantiation relation.' For it is obvious that the instantiation relation cannot be instantiated by a single object: it needs at least two objects. But the fact that a instantiates F-ness is a single object, a unit. Given this clarification, [4], [5] and [6] follow. The upshot is that, as a result of confusing the instantiation relation with the instantiation relationship, Armstrong confuses his innocuous regress with Brad- ley's regress, which poses the real threat to the instantiation or exemplification relation. By misunderstanding Bradley's regress, he does not appreciate its true force. Bradley's problem concerns the very constitution of a state of affairs in the first place, not what happens once there is a state of affairs. Given a state of affairs, the ensuing regress is of course benign. Bradley's regress, however, is internal to would-be states of affairs. There must be something that binds to- gether the constituents of a would-be state of affairs; but if this is a further con- stituent, a vicious infinite regress breaks out that prevents the formation of a state of affairs. The upshot is that none of the above four responses to Bradley is effective, and that his regress argument remains a devastating refutation of the attempt to account for the unity of a fact or state of affairs in terms of any constituent thereof. And since Bradley's problem is a problem about unity, and not a prob- lem about avoiding a regress, it should also be clear by now that adopting Frege's doctrine of the unsaturatedness of concepts or properties does nothing to solve the unity problem. 4. The Connector as the State of Affairs itself The reductionist approach to facts fails. A fact is a contingent unity of constit- uents, but this unity, which needs explaining due to its contingency, cannot be explained in terms of a special unifying constituent. (Nor can it be explained by saying that properties have slots into which particulars fit.) Nevertheless, if there are to be states of affairs at all, something must hold particulars and uni-</page><page sequence="10">246 NO US versals together, and if this cannot be an item internal to a state of affairs, then one might suppose that it must be the state of affairs itself. Armstrong accord- ingly holds that "States of affairs hold their constituents together..."28 On this view the proper response to Bradley is to adopt a nonreductionist approach ac- cording to which states of affairs are not analyzable without remainder into their constituents; they are irreducible albeit complex entities. A state of affairs is a complex that is ontologically additional to its constituents, including any sec- ondary ones one cares to posit. It is 'an addition to being' as opposed to 'an ontological free lunch.' Among the proponents of nonreductionist states of af- fairs are Armstrong, Kenneth Olson, and Herbert Hochberg. For Olson, "The connection [between a and F-ness, say] is not a constituent of the fact, it is the fact itself."29 Thus facts are not "analyzable without residue into their constit- uents," one of which serves to bind together the others; they are instead "ir- reducible entities in their own right." 30 Essentially the same view was maintained about a decade earlier by Hochberg for whom facts are "irreducible" albeit com- plex entities, "existents in addition to constituents of facts."31 Suppose we consider the nonreductionist view in Armstrong's version. For Armstrong, "there is no relation of instantiation over and above the states of affairs themselves." 32 "States of affairs hold their constituents together. 33 "...there is no call to bind together the constituents of a state of affairs by any- thing beyond the state of affairs itself. The instantiation of universals by par- ticulars is just the state of affairs itself." 34 I submit that the nonreductionist conception of states of affairs is incoher- ent. I will provide three arguments. Al. A state of affairs is composed of its constituents, but the composition is 'unmereological.' By this I simply mean that the existence of the constituents of a state of affairs does not entail the existence of the state of affairs in the way in which the existence of the members of a mereological sum does entail the existence of the sum. In this sense, sets are mereological compositions: the existence of the elements of a set entails the existence of the set. Of course, there is a sense in which sets are not mereological: sets do not obey all the laws of mereology. For example, the sum of all cats includes the parts of all cats, but the set of all cats includes cats only and not their parts. For David Lewis, states of affairs are impossible since unmereological com- position is a contradiction in terms.35 But this would be to beg the question against defenders of states of affairs who would calmly reply that the truth- maker argument establishes their existence, and it is simply the nature of these critters to be unmereological compositions. In any case, it is not true that there can be no unmereological compositions. If I place all my chess books side by side on one shelf with opening manuals first and endgame studies last, I have created an unmereological composition: the existence of my chess books does not entail their togetherness on one shelf, let alone the existence of that partic- ular arrangement of them. What is true is that there are no unmereological com-</page><page sequence="11">States of Affairs 247 positions without an external composer. (To appreciate that sets, which do not require an external composer, are not counterexamples to this, recall my expla- nation of 'unmereological' in the previous paragraph. On that explanation, sets are mereological compositions in the sense that the existence of a set's mem- bers entails the existence of the set.) Thus we can modify the Lewis objection so that it does not simply beg the question against the defender of states of af- fairs. The objection would then be that states of affairs as Armstrong conceives them are unmereological compositions without an external composer (connec- tor, unifier), and it is impossible that there be such a thing. This does not beg the question against the defender of states of affairs since the defender need not adopt a nonreductionist theory of states of affairs. In this modified form the objection is sound. It is impossible to see how states of affairs can be both nonsupervenient entities (entities whose existence is not entailed by the existence of their constituents) and yet composed of these con- stituents unless there is an external unifier that accounts for the unity of the state of affair's constituents. How there could be such an external unifier will be ex- plained in the next section. Apart from an external unifier, a nonsupervenient state of affairs is a whole of parts (insofar as it is a complex) that is not a whole of parts (insofar as it is more than its constituents), and is thus a self-contradictory structure. A2. Along the same lines, what is the difference between the sum, a + F-ness, and the fact, a's being F? On the nonreductionist approach, these two are dis- tinct, but nothing makes them distinct. I am not assuming that there cannot be entities that are just numerically distinct without anything that makes them dis- tinct: Armstrong's thin particulars fit this description, and I will assume that they are unproblematic. My point is that it is difficult to see how two complexes can be distinct without there being anything internal or external to them that makes them distinct. Every other type of complex of our acquaintance is such that there is no difference without either a difference in constituent or a difference grounded in an external entity; so why should facts be any different? Two sets, for exam- ple, cannot differ unless they differ in an element; two sums unless they differ in a member. Consider a bicycle and (the sum of) its disassembled parts. Are these two just distinct without anything that makes them distinct? Obviously not. The distinctness is due to an external entity, an assembler. How then can a fact and the corresponding sum of its constituents just differ? One might bite the bullet here and say that this is just the way facts are. In support of this one might adduce apparent cases in which two facts differ with- out differing in a constituent. Where R is a non-symmetrical relation, loves for example, aRb and bRa seem to differ without differing in a constituent. If there are complexes that differ without differing in a constituent, perhaps the differ- ence between a fact and its corresponding sum is but another instance of this. Indeed, in one place Armstrong argues for states of affairs from the premise that there are complexes that differ without differing in a constituent.36 Since aRb</page><page sequence="12">248 NOUS and bRa (R either non-symmetrical or asymmetrical) are different states of af- fairs that share all constituents, they differ only by being different states of affairs. "Hence we require states of affairs in our ontology."37 This is not a satisfactory argument for states of affairs. For one thing, it is question-begging.38 And as Armstrong later came to realize under the influence of Reinhardt Grossmann, it is not at all clear that our two relational facts do not differ in a constituent.39 Arguably, ...RR is different from R... . Non- symmetrical and asymmetrical relations have a 'direction' so that, e.g., x's lov- ing y is distinct from y's loving x. Thus there is something internal to the two states of affairs that distinguishes them; they do not just differ as states of af- fairs. In any case, how could they differ as states of affairs given that the dif- ference has to do with the order of the constituents? With the concession to Grossmann, Armstrong loses an independent reason for accepting states of affairs as unmereological compositions. (But a bad rea- son is one well lost.) He is thrown back upon the truthmaker argument as the sole support for nonreductionist (nonsupervenient) states of affairs. It is there- fore puzzling when he writes that "If we have to choose between the (intuitive- ly quite attractive) 'Nominalist' principle ['a system is nominalistic ... if no two entities are generated from exactly the same atoms.'] and the truthmaker argu- ment that leads us toward states of affairs, then my judgment is that the truth- maker principle is by far the more attractive."40 Well, they are both attractive, and there is no need to choose between them. To reject the notion that facts supervene upon their constituents it is not necessary to hold that facts can dif- fer without differing in a constituent; it is only necessary to grasp Bradley's point that a fact is more than its constituents. It is consistent to maintain both that (i) facts are more than their constituents and (ii) facts cannot differ without differ- ing in a constituent. Indeed, I claim that both (i) and (ii) are true. This second argument may be summed up as follows. It is unintelligible to suppose that two distinct complexes just differ as a matter of brute fact. A fact and the sum of its constituents are distinct complexes; hence there is need for a ground of their difference. The case of aRb and bRa ( R either asymmetrical or non-symmetrical) does not show that two complexes can just differ. A3. On the nonreductionist conception, a state of affairs is a connectedness of constituents without a connector 'responsible' for this connectedness. This implies that (SI) a's being F and (S2) b's being G have no constituent in com- mon. And yet each is a state of affairs, and so they appear to have the universal being a state of affairs in common. Now this is puzzling. If SI and S2 have no constituent in common, how do we explain the fact that they are both states of affairs? This is no problem for the reductionist who posits a universal instanti- ation relation in both; he can say that they are both states of affairs because one and the same constituent ties their respective primary constituents into states of affairs. There is a universal of being a state of affairs because there is a uni- versal of instantiation. But the nonreductionist cannot say this. What he must say is that there is no (or need not be any) universal of being a state of affairs</page><page sequence="13">States of Affairs 249 because there is no (or need not be any) universal of instantiation. So the non- reductionist faces the problem of explaining why we group all states of affairs together as states of affairs. Armstrong with his characteristic intellectual hon- esty recognizes the problem. In the case of a's being F and b's being F he says that it is the common universal F-ness that accounts for their both being states of affairs.4' But what if there is no common universal as there cannot be when we consider all states of affairs? Armstrong's solution is this: "...the unity of the class of all the states of affairs is given by the unity of the class of all the universals. This latter, in turn, would seem to flow from the essential nature of universals: their promiscuous repeatability."42 But what could this mean? It cannot mean that what universals have in com- mon is repeatability, and that this repeatability is also what states of affairs have in common. For it is clear that states of affairs are (thick) particulars and are thus unrepeatable. This is the famous "victory of particularity." Combine a (thin) particular and a universal and you get a (thick) particular. Nor can Armstrong mean that what all states of affairs have in common is that they include univer- sals. For this is also true of sets, sums, and conjunctions of universals. Clearly, what all states of affairs have in common is a peculiar sort of unity of their respective constituents. Each state of affairs is a unity of its constitu- ents, but if unity is to be common, there must be that which is the universal ground of these particular unities. The reductionist will say that this is the uni- versal of instantiation. In the next section I will float the suggestion that there is an external unifier that is responsible for the unity of each fact's constitu- ents. But Armstrong, and nonreductionists generally, are not in a position to spec- ify in a satisfactory manner that which is common to all states of affairs as states of affairs. 5. The Connector as External to the State of Affairs The dialectical tide has washed us up on the shores of a strange predicament. The truthmaker argument gave us excellent reason to posit states of affairs or facts. But when we confronted the question as to what exactly they are, we hit an aporetic impasse. We examined and rejected the reductionist idea that the connector of a fact's constituents is a further constituent. This led to an exam- ination and rejection of what seems to be the only other theoretical possibility, namely, that a state of affairs is an irreducible entity, a connectedness of con- stituents without a connector. If these are the only two possibilities, then the concept of a state of affairs is an incoherent one, and that the truthmaker argu- ment, despite its appeal, is ultimately unsound. But there is a third possibility, namely, that the unity of a state of affair's constituents is due to an external unifier. For it does not straightaway follow from a fact's being more than its (primary and secondary) constituents that it is a connectedness without a connector or unifier. The unifier might be external to the fact and its constituents. If sense can be made of this, we can retain the</page><page sequence="14">250 NOUS attractive view that a fact is not an entity distinct from its constituents (which is the element of truth in the reductionist approach) while also accounting for the undeniable unity of the fact's constituents. Just as contingently true sen- tences have need of states of affairs to make them true, contingent states of af- fairs have need of an external unifier to connect their constituents and so make them exist. The external unifier is the 'existence-maker' of states of affairs. Such an 'existence-maker' cannot of course be an empirical cause. For empirical causes and effects are states of affairs, but the 'existence-maker' of states of affairs is what makes it the case that there are states of affairs in the first place. (If you think contingent states of affairs need no explanation of their existence, why should you think that contingent sentences need an explanation of their truth?) But what could this external unifier, this 'existence-maker,' be? Let's be- gin with some analogies. For a number of rocks to constitute a cairn (trail marker) they must be stacked. (It is also perhaps necessary that they be stacked by a purposive agent, one who intends to mark a trail by stacking rocks, but this is no part of the analo- gy.) Hence the mere existence of the constituent rocks does not entail the ex- istence of the cairn: the composition is 'unmereological' or 'non-automatic.' Something more is needed to bring the rocks together to form a cairn, and it is evident that this further ingredient cannot be another rock or any other physical object internal to the cairn. It must be something external to the cairn, whether a purposive agent or forces of nature. The togetherness of the rocks in the cairn is not a further rock internal to the cairn, or something brought about by a further rock internal to it, just as the togetherness of the constituents in a state of affairs is not a further constituent, or something brought about by a further constituent. But we will certainly not conclude from this that cairns hold their constituents together. Thus we will not conclude that cairns are ontologically additional to their constituents, that they are irreducible entities belonging to a category different from that of their constituents. A cairn is just stacked rocks, and stacked rocks are just rocks that have been stacked by an external agent. We will explain the unmereological mode of composition, i.e., the difference between three rocks and the same three rocks stacked into a cairn by invoking an external unifier, namely, the agent purposive or not who/which stacked the rocks. This explanation makes clear the relation between the cairn and its con- stituent rocks: the cairn is the product of the operation of a stacker upon pre- existing materials. To say that cairns are ontologically additional to their constituents would leave this relation wholly unclear. What this analogy suggests is that the external unifier must be a metaphys- ical agent or perhaps some sort of ontological operator; it cannot be an inert constituent but must instead do something to the primary constituents to unify them. Of course, in the case of the cairn, the agent is an empirical causal agent, presumably the person who stacked the rocks, or perhaps blind forces of na- ture; but as already pointed out, the existence of the ontologically basic states of affairs comprising the ultimate furniture of the world cannot depend on an</page><page sequence="15">States of Affairs 251 empirical cause. Every analogy breaks down somewhere; the cairn analogy breaks down here. The point of the analogy is that, just as the togetherness of the rocks in a cairn cannot be accounted for except by invoking an external uni- fier, the togetherness of a universal and a (thin) particular in a monadic fact cannot be accounted for except in terms of an external unifier. But the nature of the unifying is different in the two cases: in the first it is empirical; in the second it is ontological or metaphysical. Recall that on the reductionist conception of states of affairs what was im- possible to accommodate was the felt need for a tying tie as opposed to a tie that was just one more constituent wanting unification with the others. I am well aware what a reductionist like Bergmann would say in response to my demand for a tying tie or a connecting connector. He would say that this is a piece of anthropomorphism that cannot be taken literally: all talk of making, makers, ty- ing, ties, etc. (talk in which he freely engages) is metaphorical and must at the end of the day be cashed out literally.43 Bergmann makes a brave and brilliant attempt in this direction in his posthumous New Foundations of Ontology with his difficult doctrine of 'canons.' But I cannot see that he succeeds: the 'parti- cipial dimension' (the tying, making, etc.) cannot be expunged from ontology. To argue this out would take many a page, but I can throw out a hint on the present occasion. To the Feuerbachian suggestion that God is an anthropomor- phic projection of man, the theist can calmly reply that it is the other way around: Man is a theomorphic projection of God. Similarly here. To the Bergmannian suggestion that talk of tying and making, etc. is an anthropomorphic projection of human agency onto the nonhuman, the theistic defender of states of affairs can calmly reply that human and nonhuman states of affairs (thick particulars) are theomorphic to the extent that their existence depends on God's unifying activity. An option shy of theism is to say that human and nonhuman states of affairs are noomorphic to the extent that their existence depends on (transcen- dental) mind's unifying activity. More on this later. But again, this connecting or tying activity that makes states of affairs out of universals and particulars is not an empirical event-causal process any more than truthmaking is an empirical event-causal process. The relata of the causal relation are presumably facts or events;44 hence facts or events are presup- posed for there to be causation, and thus the 'existence-maker' of states of af- fairs is not an empirical event-cause of them. If we can understand how there can be a making or a grounding that is not an empirical event-causing-as pre- sumably we can if we understand the truthmaker argument-we should also be able to understand how there can be a connecting or unifying that is not an em- pirical event-causal process. One possibility this leaves open is that it is agent- causal where the agent is a metaphysical (non-empirical) entity. Let us now consider a less crude analogy, a nonphysical one. One can com- bine in imagination elements that cannot be combined in reality. I may form the mental image of a Saguaro cactus with human legs, say as part of an imag- ined comic strip in which a Saguaro runs away from a cactus rustler. Suppose I</page><page sequence="16">252 NOUS do this. The complex mental image is a unity of elements, and it is clear that what unifies the elements cannot be any further element. On the one hand, the complex is nothing more than its elements. But on the other hand, the complex is something more than its elements, since it is the latter actually united. The only way to resolve this tension is by positing an external unifier, which in this case is the mind that does the imaginative combining. It would be absurd to suppose that the complex image is an entity above and beyond its constituents. But the best analogy is as follows. Suppose I judge that a is F, and suppose further that the contents of acts of judging are not Fregean propositions, but items that cannot exist apart from acts of judging. In judging that a is F I create mentally a complex content composed of a subject-constituent and a predicate- constituent. This complex is a unity of constituents. On the one hand, the judg- mental content is nothing more than its constituents. But on the other hand, the judgmental content is something more than its constituents insofar as it is the latter actually united to form a content capable of being either true or false-in the way in which neither the constituents taken by themselves, nor any list, set or sum of them is capable of being either true or false. But how can the judg- mental content be something more than its constituents without being a further entity irreducible to them? The only way to resolve this tension is by positing an external unifier, an external ground of the unity of the judgmental content. In this case it is the judging consciousness that brings about the content's unity. Without recourse to such an external ground, we would be stuck with the tension. I take it that no human (or any finite) consciousness could be the external unifier, the external ontological ground, of states of affairs. That would be to embrace an intolerable idealism. But if one is a theist one has at hand a good candidate for external unifier. God has His uses. God can play the role of ex- ternal unifier or 'existence-maker' for all contingent states of affairs. What I have said does not of course amount to an argument for the existence of God, but at most an argument for an external unifier. My point is merely that the the- ist already has an entity in his ontology that can play the role of external unifier.45 But one need not go the theistic route in search of an external unifier. One might perhaps maintain that the concept of a state of affairs is a transcendental concept imposed on the world by transcendental consciousness. The rudiments of such a view may be gleaned from Butchvarov's latest book.46 He would agree that states of affairs are neither reducible to their constituents nor irreduc- ible entities in their own right.47 And yet, "...they are indispensable for any (advanced) thought and especially for language about the world."48 For it is essential to indicative sentences that they have a truth-value, and as Butch- varov notes, this is most naturally understood in terms of 'correspondence' with the world. Thus Butchvarov would appear to accept the truthmaker argu- ment for states of affairs. But if states of affairs are neither reducible to their constituents, nor irreducible entities in their own right, then they must depend on something external to them for their constitution or noncausal construction. Butchvarov speaks of imposition. We impose "propositional forms on the man- ifold of entities we confront, that is, by 'seeing' them as constituents of states</page><page sequence="17">States of Affairs 253 of affairs, rather than just as a bare 'given.' "49 In this sense, (transcendental) consciousness 'makes' states of affairs. Whatever the ultimate value of this proposal, it at least illustrates the idea of an external unifier. It may occur to readers familiar with Hector-Neri Castanieda's theory of on- tological operators that it provides a more sober way of fleshing out the idea of an external unifier than the theistic and transcendental ways just suggested. But although there are certain analogies between Castanieda's ontological operators and the external unifier, the former are too anemic to do the job of unification. With his talk of ontological operators, Castafieda seems to be importing activ- ity and the 'participal dimension' into the serene precincts of ontology; but in fact he does not. Castanieda introduces his theory of ontological operators by way of a discus- sion of the problem of individuation, a problem he distinguishes from that of diversity.50 The problem of individuation is concerned with what makes an in- dividual be an individual, whereas the problem of diversity is concerned with what makes numerically diverse entities be numerically diverse. The tendency is to conflate these two problems, but Castafieda successfully argues for their separation. Now suppose you have two distinct individuals a and b. Since both are individuals, the individuator that which 'makes' them be individuals- should be common. Could a and b be individuals in virtue of their instantiation of a common property, that of individuality? Obviously not. "Instantiation, which is an external connection between a property and what instances it, presup- poses that a full-fledged entity fit to be the subject is already constituted."51 In other words, it would be hopelessly circular to explain the individuality of an individual in terms of a property that the individual instantiates: an individual must already (logically speaking) be an individual if it is to instantiate any prop- erties. But if the individuator is common to all individuals, but is not a prop- erty, what is it and how is it related to individuals? Castafieda proposes that within the category of abstract entities we must rec- ognize the sui generis subcategory of ontological operators on properties or sets of properties. The individuator, then, is an operator. This allows us to explain the constitution of a concrete individual as follows. Begin with some proper- ties, say, P, Q, and R. Operate upon them with the set-forming braces {...} to form the set {P, Q, R}, which is an abstract individual. Now operate upon this set with the concretizing operator c to form the concrete individual c{P, Q, R}. To complete the picture, think of this operating not as something we do, but as something the operator does. Think of operators as having ontological standing apart from mind and language. This seems to satisfy the demands of the situa- tion, since the operator c is common to all concrete individuals, but not com- mon in the manner of a property. Because c 'produces' c{P, Q, R} 'out of' {P, Q, R}, c is not related to c{P, Q, R}, as it would be if the individuator were a property instantiated by the individual. Why not then think of the external unifier as an ontological operator in Castanieda's sense? It is clear that the external unifier cannot be a property in- ternal to a fact, for then it would be just one more constituent wanting unifica-</page><page sequence="18">254 NOUS tion with the others. Nor can it be a property exemplified by a fact, for a fact must already (logically speaking) be constituted as a fact if it is to exemplify any properties. So it is natural to think of the external unifier U as something like an ontological operator. Accordingly, U operates upon a set or perhaps an ordered n-tuple of fact-appropriate constituents to produce a fact. There would then be three items to distinguish, operator, operand, product: U(a, R, b) = Fl; in the monadic case, U(a, F-ness) = F2. A closer look, however, will show that U cannot be an ontological operator in Castafieda's sense. On Castanieda's theory, operators are "syncategorematic," "dependent" entities which "combine with their operands in a unique and un- analyzable way."52 They are dependent entities in the sense there is no differ- ence such as would cause Bradleyan trouble between an operator operating upon its operand and an operator + its operand. In the concrete individual c{P, Q, R}, one cannot drive a Bradleyan wedge between operator c and operand {P, Q, R}. This is because the connection between operator and operand is noncontingent. In Castafieda's Meinongian ontology, for every set of properties, whether com- possible or not, there is a corresponding concrete (but not necessarily existent) individual: it is not as if c operates on some property sets but not on others. The concretizing operator operates on all of them, and necessarily so. One can- not therefore reasonably ask for the ontological ground of the difference be- tween c{P, Q, R} and the set {c, {P, Q, R}} or the difference between c{P, Q, R}and the sum c + {P, Q, R}. Bradley's regress cannot arise from within the structure of a concrete individual on Castafieda's assay of same. U, however, cannot be a syncategorematic or dependent entity in this sense for the simple reason that its combination with its operands is contingent: U operates on some but not all sets of fact-appropriate constituents, and those sets it does operate on, it might not have operated on. U therefore cannot be a de- pendent entity. Unlike c, it must be distinct from its operating even if it cannot exist without operating on some set of fact-appropriate constituents or other. As such, U is not an ontological operator in Castafieda's sense. How then does the postulation of external U avoid Bradley's problem? If an internal unifier gives rise to the problem, why shouldn't an external one do so as well? Apparently, there will still be the problem of how U connects with what it unifies given the contingency of the connection. If the difference between the fact aRb and the mere sum a + R + b demands an ontological ground distinct from these constituents, then why doesn't the difference between U(a, R, b) and U + (a, R, b) demand an ontological ground distinct from this second sum of items? So the question remains as to the ontological ground of the difference between U(a, R, b) and U + (a, R, b). The better to appreciate the difficulty, recall that I found fault with the Blan- shard line that "the business of a relation is to relate" on the ground that it is- sues in a dilemma. For taken in one way, it implies that external relations are essential to their terms, which is absurd, since that would entail that there are no contingent relational facts. But taken in the other way, as boiling down to the plausible claim that there are no uninstantiated relations, it fails to explain the</page><page sequence="19">States of Affairs 255 difference between a relation's relating specific relata and its failing to do so. Now if this dilemma is decisive against Blanshard, why isn't it decisive against my operator theory? Isn't a contingently unifying unifier strictly analogous to an externally relating relation? What is accomplished by introducing an opera- tor to do the work of a relation? The dilemma my operator theory appears to face is as follows. If U's being a unifying unifier (as opposed to an inert item that in turn needs unification with what it unifies) means that U necessarily unifies the sets of fact-appropriate constituents that it does unify, then the facts that result will be necessarily existent which contradicts their being contingent. If, on the other hand, it remains contingent that U unify the sets of constituents that it does in fact unify, then how can U be a unifying unifier, one for which the difference between U qua unifying the members of set S, and the mere sum, U + the mem- bers of S, cannot arise? Thus it may appear that the preceding operator rigma- role makes no advance at all over the Blanshard position. But it does make an advance if we are willing to construe U robustly enough. U must satisfy three constraints: (i) the connection between U and its operand must be contingent and so cannot be grounded in the nature of U; (ii) the con- nection cannot be brute, and so must have a ground; (iii) the ground must lie in U itself on pain of a vicious infinite regress. Now if the connection between U and its operand cannot be grounded in the nature of U, and yet must be grounded in U, then U must have the power of contingent self-determination: it must have the power to contingently determine itself as operating upon its operand. In other words, if U is the ground of the contingent unity of a fact's constituents, then U contingently grounds its grounding of the unity of the fact's constituents. A model for U that satisfies the above constraints is available in our own freedom which of course is a power of contingent self-determination. Suppose I freely unify disparate elements in the synthetic unity of one consciousness: I judge that a is F, or perhaps I merely entertain the thought that a is F. The con- nection instituted is contingent; both the connection between the subject and predicate representations, and the connection between me and the judgmental content. The connections are contingent since I could have refrained from com- bining the representations. But the connections are not brute since they have a ground in my combining activity. As for the third constraint, my consciousness C, as the unifier of the subject- and predicate-representations, is not an inert ontological ingredient that itself needs unification with what it unifies. It is not as if there must be a C' which unifies a, C, and F-ness, a C" which unifies a, C, C', and F-ness and so on into a vicious infinite regress. A Bradley-type regress cannot arise precisely be- cause C is a unifying unifier in a way in which a relation cannot be. An exter- nal relation is not exhausted in its relating of what it relates, else it would be essential to its terms and hence not external. But if it is not exhausted in its relating of what it relates, then it is distinct from them and the problem arises as to how it forms a unity with its terms. You cannot say that a relation, in re- lating its relata, relates itself to them in such a way that it grounds not only their togetherness, but also its togetherness with them. For no relation has the</page><page sequence="20">256 NOUS power of contingent self-determination. But this is exactly the power conscious- ness exercises when it unifies disparate representations: it establishes their to- getherness, and in so doing, establishes its togetherness with them. Thus the difference between U(a, R, b) and U + (a, R, b) is grounded by U itself in a way that an external relation R cannot ground the difference between aRb and a + R + b. This of course requires that we impute to U the power of contingent self-determination, which in turn demands that U be construed along the lines of God or a transcendental consciousness. Of course, my talk of an external unifying unifier needs more defense than can be provided here and may itself in the end prove to be incoherent. If it does, the truthmaker argument, and indeed every argument, for states of affairs is doomed. For then there would not be any coherent conception of a state of affairs. 6. Conclusion The truthmaker argument takes us from contingent truths to their ontological grounds in worldly states of affairs. But states of affairs are problematic enti- ties. They are composed of simpler entities, their constituents, and so one nat- urally tries to understand them as reducible to their constituents. This reductionist attempt, however, cannot account for the unity of states of affairs and so moti- vates the view that states of affairs are irreducible entities distinct from their constituents. But this view is equally unacceptable since it cannot explain how a state of affairs, a complex, can be distinct from the very constituents of which it is composed and without which it is nothing at all. Now if these were the only two ways of construing states of affairs if they were logical contradic- tories of one another we would have to conclude that the concept of a state of affairs is internally incoherent, and that the truthmaker argument for states of affairs is unsound. But the two ways of construing states of affairs are logical contraries of one another, and so can both be false. There is the possibility that the unity of a state of affairs derives from an external unifier. (And it is the only other possi- bility.) So if the truthmaker argument for states of affairs is sound, then states of affairs have an external unifier. I would apply Modus Ponens at this point; others will reach for Modus Tollens.53 Notes ID. M. Armstrong, A World of States of Affairs (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997), p. 115 ff. I will follow Armstrong in writing 'truthmaker' without a hyphen. 2In a's being F, a and F-ness are the primary constituents; any further constituents posited to tie together the primary ones are secondary. Thus instantiation relations and nonrelational ties are secondary constituents. 3Gustav Bergmann, Realism: A Critique of Brentano and Meinong (Madison: The University of Wisconsin Press, 1967).</page><page sequence="21">States of Affairs 257 4Like Armstrong, I assume throughout a principle of unrestricted mereological composition.

This is not quite the way Bradley sets up the problem, since for him all relations are dyadic (two-termed). But my interest is in reconstruction over exegesis. The importance of his ar- gument does not hinge on a doctrinal peculiarity that most present-day philosophers would reject. For Bradley, a dyadic relation RI is needed to tie a to R, a separate dyadic relation R2 to tie R to b, and so on infinitely and viciously. 71f the properties of particulars are themselves particulars, Bradley's problem does not seem to arise. Suppose substance S has accident A. Since A cannot exist except in S, being nothing more than a nontransferable and unrepeatable mode or modification of S, there is no need for any third item to tie it to S. If Socrates' whiteness exists at all, it exists in Socrates; hence there is no differ- ence between the fact of Socrates' being white and the sum, Socrates + his whiteness. To put it another way, if Socrates and his whiteness both exist, then the fact of Socrates' being white 'auto- matically' exists. 8lbid., p. 28. 9Brand Blanshard, "Bradley on Relations" in The Philosophy of F.

The problem is not to explain the difference between a fact and the corresponding set of its constituents, but between a fact and its constituents. And if anyone is tempted to think of a sum as distinct from its members, then I will reformulate the problem as fol- lows: What is the difference between a's being F and the membership of the sum, a + F-ness + NEX? 18Note that in 'possible fact,' 'possible' is what Geach calls an alienans adjective: it shifts or alienates the sense of 'fact' in the way 'negative' in 'negative growth' shifts the sense of 'growth.' Strictly speaking, a possible fact is no more a fact than negative growth is growth. For a fact is the actual unity of its primary and secondary constituents and not their mere sum. This of course im- plies that all facts exist or are actual; there are no merely possible facts. There are no facts in the mode of possibility. This is of course not the view Bergmann came to hold after Realism. 191 am of course aware that states of affairs are entia non grata in Frege's mature thought. What interests me here is solely the idea that properties are unsaturated. 20Frege of course denies that unsaturated entities can be named. If this doctrine were unprob- lematic, it would perhaps provide a way of handling the unity problem. But the doctrine is deeply paradoxical if not incoherent, implying as it does that "The concept horse is not a concept." See G. Frege, "On Concept and Object" in Translations from the Philosophical Writings of Gottlob Frege, eds. Geach and Black (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1960), p. 46. 21See note 7.</page><page sequence="22">258 NOUS 22As was claimed by one of the Nous referees. 23Reinhardt Grossmann, The Categorial Structure of the World (Bloomington: Indiana Univer- sity Press, 1983), p. 169. 24D.

M. Armstrong, A World of States of Affairs, p. 118. 33Ibid. I take this in a privative, not a positive, sense. Thus I do not uncharitably read Arm- strong as committed to the absurdity that states of affairs, which are logically posterior to their con- stituents as that out of which they are formed, are at the same time logically prior to them as that which ties them into states of affairs. I take his dictum to mean, not that there is a unifier of state of affairs S's constituents and that unifier is S itself, but that S's constituents has no unifier. Com- pare 'God is causa sui.' Taken positively, this says that God causes himself, which is absurd. Taken privatively, it says that God is not caused by another, which is reasonable. 34Ibid., p. 119. 35David Lewis, "Critical Notice of Armstrong, D.

What is the external unifier of these states of affairs? One must avoid both a vicious infinite regress as well as the ob- noxious thesis that God unifies Himself. One way to do this, as one of the Nous referees percep- tively notes, is by invoking the medieval doctrine of divine simplicity. Thus it should come as no surprise to this referee that I have defended the coherence of this doctrine elsewhere ("Divine Sim- plicity: A New Defense," Faith and Philosophy, vol. 9, no. 4 (October 1992), pp. 508-525). But it is not necessary to go this far. The unity of a state of affairs is a problem only if its constituents are contingently connected. But God is not contingently connected to His existence or to His attributes. God's being omniscient, for example, exists or obtains necessarily; hence there is no need for an external unifier beyond God. 46Panayot Butchvarov, Skepticism about the External World (New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998).</page><page sequence="23">States of Affairs 259 47Ibid., p. 131. 48Ibid. 49Ibid., p. 132. 50Hector-Neri Castafieda, "Individuation and Non-Identity: A New Look," American Philosoph- ical Quarterly vol. 12, no. 2 (April 1975), pp. 131-140 5'Ibid., p. 137. 52Ibid., pp. 138-139. 53 am indebted to Lawrence H.
