<plain_text><page sequence="1">DUAL BELONGING/PERSONAL JOURNEYS Retracing Buddhist Encounters Ursula King University of Bristol My aim is a modest one-to retrace earlier experiences of encounters with Buddhism and share my thoughts with others. I am not writing as a "dual practitioner," nor do I philosophize about "double belonging," its possibility or impossibility. Neither do I intend to write in an academic, objectifying mode of thought. It is not even about my ongoing personal journey, as journeys seem to imply participation in a continu- ing process. What I am going to describe are more unconnected encounters, years apart, rather than an ongoing journey, perhaps more like Grace Burford's "postcards" than any of the other accounts submitted. I first caught a glimpse, no more, of Buddhist thought in my early teens, in one of my school history books, and was both puzzled and intrigued to see Buddhism described as "more of a philosophy than a religion." What could that possibly mean, and how could I find out more about this so very different religious thought from the East of which our teacher spoke so highly? Later I learned more, but not much, in comparative religion classes and philosophy of religion courses during my univer- sity studies in the fifties and sixties, and from reading Henri de Lubac's book on the Amida Buddha and his study on the encounter between Buddhism and the West, a pioneering but little known work written in 1952, just before the expansion of Bud- dhism into the West really took off. I also saw Buddhist monks and rituals in some of the documentary films (with Arnold Toynbee as a narrator) I used in a world reli- gions class taught almost forty years ago. But none of this really prepared me for meeting Buddhist people and Buddhist culture in Asian lands, all unpredictably more diverse and appealing than any description found in Western books. When I lived with my family in New Delhi from 1965 to 1970, I met a Buddhist monk from Cambodia who had founded a vihara outside New Delhi open to peo- ple of all faiths, and it is there that I first encountered and took part in Buddhist meditation, worship, and festivals, but what attracted me most and left an indelible impression were the profoundly moving spirit of wisdom and compassion and acts of loving kindness that I experienced again and again and that moved me deeply to the core. Such experiences are so alive and vivid, so rich in texture and memory traces that they can feed thoughts and attitudes for the rest of one's life, but they are never fully captured in clever intellectual and philosophical abstractions, however Buddhist-Christian Studies 23 (2003). ? by University of Hawai'i Press.

It is for this reason that I always value and cherish the richness of lived experience and participation, even in its often contradictory and profoundly ambivalent nature, more than any finely honed intel- lectual points concerning profoundly metaphysical insights about ultimate reality or absolute truth claims. In this sense I am perhaps more a practitioner realizing the rela- tional, contingent nature of any and all positions rather than an absolutist thinker wanting to defend one system of thought over another. Soon my personal contacts with Buddhists in India grew through meeting dif- ferent Tibetan monks, and some Tibetan nuns too, and through visits to the newly founded Tibet House in New Delhi. But most of all I was deeply touched by an early visit to the Dalai Lama in Dharamsala, probably in March 1966, in the company of an American Sacred Heart nun, Mother Adele Fiske from Manhattan College, who was fitting in this visit while officially undertaking research on the Ambedkhar Bud- dhists, the leatherworker converts from an outcaste background, some of whom I also met on different occasions. The personal visit to the Dalai Lama in an intimate setting was a high point of my life, as (with the help of an interpreter) we spent about an hour and a half discussing the Christian understanding of the Holy Spirit in comparison to the Buddhist idea ofprajnaparamita, of ultimate wisdom. I wished I had known more about Buddhism then, or that a Christian theologian of the stature of Henri de Lubac could have been present at this important conversation. It was a very deep and searching discussion that outlasted the assigned hour of our visit, at the end of which the interpreter told us we had discussed with His Holiness what inter- ested him most deeply. This has remained with me always, and this deep memory trace was further strengthened when about eight years later I was introduced to the Dalai Lama after an interfaith service in Westminster Abbey, London. Hardly expect- ing he would remember me, I was amazed when he said, "Oh yes, I remember meet- ing before. We talked so much about theology then." There were many other encounters in other places, at other times-Bodh Gaya, Mathura, Varanasi. Traveling in Sri Lanka in 1981, I visited many of the Buddhist holy places there and was overcome by the numinous presence conveyed by so many Buddha statues, whether at Kelanya, Kandy, Polunnaruwa, or in more modest sim- ple shrines where people performed puja. I thought of Thomas Merton's description of his encounter with the Buddha figures in Sri Lanka in his Asian Journal, but also of the much earlier reaction of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin when visiting Buddhist temples in Kobe, Japan, where he was deeply moved and felt that Christians in the West have "no finer representation of divinity" than the serene Buddha figures he encountered in Japan. During my stay in Sri Lanka I engaged more closely with the few Buddhist nuns I met, the dasasilamatas, who were then just beginning to reclaim full ordination for themselves, an aim achieved only much later. I also participated in interfaith meetings that revealed to me some of the Buddhist responses to the presence of people of other faiths in Sri Lanka itself. This was during a memorable stay at Subodhi, the Institute of Integral Education directed by Father Mervyn Fer- nando, who has been very active in the field of Buddhist-Christian dialogue through</page><page sequence="3">RETRACING BUDDHIST ENCOUNTERS his public activities and writings. I also spent a day at Tulana, Father Aloyisius Pieris's place, dedicated to participation and immersion in Buddhist life and thought, from where I took a sense of deep peace and wisdom with me that I can still recall within me. Later still, in 1985, I briefly visited Thailand, where I was asked to lecture at a monastery in Bangkok to a large group of monks on "Buddhism in Britain"-not an easy task, especially not via an interpreter, and I have often wondered what the young monks may remember from that encounter, probably so different for each side, for them and me. There are other moments I can recall, other encounters, other glimpses caught, gestures made and words exchanged. Back in Britain I have met many Western Bud- dhists too, and those living among us from India, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Japan, and China. Some became friends, other partners in dialogue. What strikes me as signif- icant in reflecting on "belonging" to a faith is the fact that I cannot see or approach either Buddhism or Christianity as a monolithic experience, but only as multifaceted, multilayered, internally very plural and diverse realities that are themselves always dynamic, always in process of living transformation and change. My encounter with the Buddhist faith has been primarily refracted through an Indian lens, and any strands of belonging are closely interwoven with an Indian, Hindu background through which I first encountered Buddhism in practice, and that also provided the historical context from which Buddhism first emerged. But my encounter with Bud- dhism has been equally connected with experiences of interfaith encounter and dia- logue, often involving members from several different faiths, so that Buddhists and Christians would be only two of several different standpoints represented at such an encounter. I think this multiplicity or complexity of contexts is important in that I find it difficult, if not impossible, to isolate and distinguish precisely which cognitive and practical influences from Buddhism alone have shaped me. What I would like to offer for further reflection and discussion are two points: (1) The appreciation of another faith and one's own-what I can become aware of, learn, practice, share-requires explicit attention and the cultivation of inner reflec- tion, and it is this we need to foster and facilitate, in ourselves and others. (2) The possibility of nurturing such reflection, mutually interrogative dialogue and exchange is much helped through the experience of interfaith encounter and dialogue in all its different forms. The work of the SBCS can be a great facilitator in this. SOME CONCLUDING REFLECTIONS ON PRAYER AND MEDITATION I add some further reflections, written recently in another context. I think they bear on the theme of double belonging and personal religious journeys nourished by more than one religious tradition: Many years ago I was asked by the BBC German service to say a few words on the difference between prayer and meditation. At the time I was surprised at the appreciative reaction these words evoked among some listeners. I have not returned 63</page><page sequence="4">URSULA KING to this theme of prayer and meditation since then, but would like to do so now when there exist many more writings on both. Far more people, both young and old, have some knowledge about and experience of these two different modes of centering. It is not my intention, however, to provide a survey here. I only offer a few thoughts of my own. I was surprised to find, though, that the recently published, quite splen- did Oxford Companion to Christian Thought (eds. Adrian Hastings, Alistair Mason, and Hugh Pyper, Oxford University Press, 2000) has no entry at all on either med- itation or contemplation, which it only mentions in passing in the long article on prayer. What does that say about Christianity, or rather about the late-twentieth- century consciousness of Christian scholars about their own religious tradition? All religions know different forms of prayer. During the First World War the German scholar Friedrich Heiler wrote a famous comparative study on prayer, which has recently been republished. But meditation, in contrast to prayer, was far less known in the West until quite recently. How do these two forms of religious expres- sion-prayer and meditation-relate to each other? Human experiences and formulations of prayer comprise many dimensions, which range from a few personal words to widely known, set prayers used over many generations; from private to public prayers to deeply mystical, wordless prayer expe- riences of exultation, adoration, supplication, and abandonment. One might almost say that oral prayer moves on into contemplative (using images without words) and meditational (without images or words) exercises. I think an important distinction is the fact that prayer always seems to be addressed to a personal God (or, in some religions, to several gods)-a very special, great person, almost a "super-person" when seen from an anthropomorphic perspective, but always a personal "Thou" who we intimately, lovingly or imploringly, speak to. The worship of a personal God is there- fore always connected with human prayer, whether traditionally formulated prayers like the "Our Father" in Christianity, spoken by an individual or a congregation, or the Orthodox "Jesus prayer," which is much more a silent inner prayer. Such deep prayers have been described as the language of the heart, and it is in this deeply per- sonal prayer that our soul breathes and grows in its intimate conversation with God. All faiths possess a rich heritage of prayers, as can be seen from contemporary anthologies and interfaith services-prayers that human beings have created and uttered in all kinds of different life situations, from the cradle to the grave. There are prayers to address all needs, to plead, to thank, to eat, to travel, to grieve, to celebrate, to adore, for different times of the day and the year, for rites of passage as well as fleeting events-the list is as long as the rich patterns of human life. Prayer seems to be mostly connected to linguistic expression in words, or even song. Comparing prayer to meditation, one might be inclined to emphasize the con- trast between such a word-centered religious activity and the silent, wordless inner meditation. But I think it is a mistake to overemphasize such distinction, which, after all, is again an external one. For many, meditation is primarily understood as con- nected with Eastern religions, especially Buddhism and Hinduism. Meditation has especially arisen within faith contexts that are centered on an impersonal Reality or</page><page sequence="5">RETRACING BUDDHIST ENCOUNTERS All, and is thus connected with an illumination or enlightenment understood to be utterly transpersonal. Meditation is closely connected with deep inner concentration and outer withdrawal; meditational techniques bear down on a deep inner center, a transcendent All-ground, although some methods also work with visualizations. But on the whole we associate meditation more with an imageless realization or experi- ence than with anything else. This kind of experience has usually been called "con- templation" in the Christian mystical tradition, whereas the word "meditation" orig- inally meant in Christianity the meditative reflection on specific themes or images, often drawn from the life of Jesus or from other biblical sources. Comparing prayer and meditation, one can say that the intentional direction of prayer is mostly one from inward to outward, from self to other, in that the prayer addresses another Person, the great "Other," so that the self finds a transcendent cen- ter for itself, whereas Eastern meditation consists rather of a movement from outward to inward, an effort to reach the immanent center of the self in a deeper dimension within. Thus, the direction of prayer and meditation differ; their center is found in a different place and experienced in a different way. But ultimately this difference disappears in that the transcendent and immanent reality touch each other in the depth of being and are ultimately interrelated. One can therefore speak of an inter- weaving and a continuity between prayer and meditation-the deepest prayer expe- rience of Christian mystics ultimately translates itself into a meditative depth expe- rience of union with the divine ground. There exists much discussion today regarding the different methods of medita- tion in East and West. But to speak of meditation is perhaps already a contradiction, because meditation is above all linked to personal practice of concentration and deep inner experience apart from words. And yet such practice requires guidance and training; thus, meditation invites both reflective thinking and practical exercises. We need to learn how to open our mind and heart, how to open ourselves inwardly to be seized by divine grace, or be at peace, be attentive and ready to receive the power of the spirit. For Christians, this is connected with the dynamic of divine life, the experience of all-sustaining love, whereas the Buddhist may experience ultimate enlightenment as both emptiness and fullness. Eastern religions have developed many helpful means for practicing meditation, whether one thinks of bodily postures, breathing exercises, helpful images such as the mandala, or repetition of words in a mantra. All of these have by now become widely familiar and are used by many Western people today. A fine example of inter- weaving Christian prayers with Buddhist meditation is found in Penelope Eckers- ley's Nepal notebook Holding the Silences (Glastonbury: Abbey Press, 1998). High up in the Himalayan Mountains she described her experience: "I closed my eyes to draw myself down into my own stillness, undisturbed by the sights around me and the thoughts to which they give rise." But she also talks of bringing "prayer and med- itation out of the limited world of introspection, ethical choices and self-improve- ment, into a greater involvement with all that IS" (93, 89). I think it is very important to see how closely interrelated prayer and meditation 65</page><page sequence="6">URSULA KING are, and it may be part of the contemporary spiritual renewal to combine the best of the two. In Christian churches people pray a great deal, but there is often not enough meditation. There is far too much emphasis on the spoken word and external action, and yet many people can no longer easily relate to the art of praying. In contempo- rary culture we are externally overstimulated by words, images, and constant noise, which seem to drown the quiet search of our inner being. Many contemporaries are therefore looking for new wholeness; they need a time and place for quietness and spiritual nourishment. That is why meditation is so popular and is a practice many are attracted to, whether they are religious or not.</page></plain_text>
