MACCORMAC Professor of Philosophy, Davidson College SCIENTIFIC AND RELIGIOUS METAPHORS For quite some time, critics have attacked religious language on the grounds that theologians employed metaphors that were irreducible.1 By irreducible, they meant metaphors that could not be paraphrased in literal language. And any such language that could not be reduced to words that can be taken in a literal sense, would be devoid of cognitive meaning or truth value. Since theologians claimed that statements like 'God is love' cannot be reduced to a literal sense without robbing the concept of God of its trans cendent status, sceptics replied that such failures merely indicated the meaninglessness of religious language. Or, if apologists did assert that 'God is love' can be paraphrased by statements describing the love of one man for another, the sceptic claimed that such a move reduced religious language to anthropological language where terms like 'God' were superfluous. Critics argued that metaphors of religion posed the following dilemma: either religious metaphors could not be reduced to literal paraphrases and were, therefore, meaningless; or, religious metaphors could be reduced to literal paraphrases, but the method by which they were reduced eliminated the necessity for theological terminology. Like most dilemmas, a solution can be found by rejecting one of the horns, in this case, the first one. The assertion that metaphors which cannot be reduced to a literal statement are meaningless is based upon the assumption that metaphors used in everyday language and in science can be reduced, and it is this reduction that justifies these metaphors as meaningful. And there certainly are numerous metaphors that appear in ordinary discourse, and, while they are new and startling when first used, they become common place after a time. When someone first said, 'he was struck by her likeness to Jane', the audience probably was surprised by the use of 'struck' for the literal meaning of this word once was 'to hit' or 'touch with force'. Although at the beginning a misuse, gradually through continued utterance, the word 'struck' came to mean 'affect emotionally' as well as 'to hit'. When we are no longer startled, 'to be struck by a resemblance' has become a dead metaphor and may be considered to be part of ordinary discourse. Since science is considered to be composed of meaningful language, the pre sumption is often made that its metaphors are similarly reducible to ordinary I Cf.

We shall argue to the contrary citing examples of metaphors in scientific language that cannot be reduced to a literal paraphrase. If religious metaphors are indicted for being irreducible, then metaphors used by scientists will incur a similar fate. The fact that a metaphor cannot be reduced to ordinary sensible discourse does not of necessity justify its condemnation as meaningless. Critics holding the irreducibility thesis-that those metaphors not reducible to literal paraphrase are meaningless, must face another difficulty arising from the impossibility of understanding a metaphor that was com pletely irreducible. The very nature of a metaphor requires that we employ a familiar word to stand for the unfamiliar. This juxtaposition of the known with the unknown produces the tension within us that enables us to recognise the utterance as a metaphor rather than as another form of ordinary dis course. If the metaphor is reducible to a literal paraphrase, then it is no longer a metaphor, instead it is ordinary language. While it may have been a metaphor, when we carry out the reduction we have reduced it to the status of being a dead metaphor. If the metaphor is completely irreducible, then we shall have difficulty in understanding it, for the terms within it will be completely foreign to our ordinary usage. Our solution will be to propose a theory of metaphor that both views metaphor as a process of linguistic development rather than as a static category, and interprets the process as resulting in a variety of outcomes. Some metaphors are certainly reduced to ordinary language while others defy full reduction, but need partial interpretation in ordinary discourse for them to be intelligible. We shall show that the indictment of religious language under the irreducibility thesis has interpreted metaphors far too simply. Positivist philosophers of science attempted to demonstrate that observa tion statements gave legitimacy to the meaning of scientific language. Their programme included an effort to reduce theoretical statements to observa tion statements by means of logical rules.1 Their goal was to show that scientific language was precise, unambiguous, and empirically confirmable. Failure, however, plagued this attempt as scientific language was found to be imprecise, ambiguous, and impossible to reduce completely to observa tion statements.2 Among scientists, historians of science, and philosophers of science, there was a growing awareness that ambiguous devices like metaphors were not just the result of poor quality scientific work, but were 1 For the most famous exposition of the reductionist programme see: Rudolf Carnap, 'Testability and Meaning', Philosophy of Science, Vol. 3, No. 4 (October I936), pp. 420-7I and Vol. 4, No. I (January I937), pp. 2-40. 2 Carnap modifies his reductionist programme to one of partial interpretations in his 'The Methodological Character of Theoretical Terms', Alinnesota Studies in the Philosophy of Science edited by Herbert Feigl and Michael Scriven (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1956).

When a scientist wanted to propose a new hypothesis or theory, he needed a linguistic device that would suggest a possible new interpretation and which was intelligible. Scientific metaphors offered just such a possibility for they would take a known word in the context of a known theory and extend its meaning by suggesting a new and speculative meaning. For example, in the context of Newtonian theory the concept of length had the connotation of rigidity; a standard length under controlled conditions of temperature did not vary. But with the advent of relativity theory, length took on the meaning of variance with velocity. Similarly, the concept of a particle has undergone a series of changes in meaning as theories about the nature of the atom have changed. From a solid irreducible unit, the notion of particle has evolved into a complex interpretation of a combination of other particles, protons, neutrons, electrons, positrons, mesons, etc., that have few of the properties of the earlier Newtonian corpuscles. Modern 'particles' have the properties of waves and energy and are most unlike the 'particles' of Democritus or Newton. As theories change, the terms within them vary in meaning and very often the variance in meaning is only possible through the use of metaphors.1 The metaphor allows the investigator to comprehend part of the new meaning since he is familiar with the term and, yet, he must stretch his imagination in order to be able to consider the new possibility that is also suggested by the metaphor. In describing modern scientific language, E. H. Hutton explicitly declares the scientist's need for metaphor. Metaphors are used to give a more precise meaning, or to add an important nuance, to our expressions, when words normally used in a given context seem to fail, we seek help through words, which usually, belong to another context. In this way we extend the usage of our customary expressions; and this is necessary if we want to build up a technical language for describing an experiment arti ficially produced in the laboratory. In physics, we speak of a field of force, or of the flow of heat, and so on. Indeed, technical discourse cannot do without meta phorical language....2 Max Jammer's studies of force, mass, and space demonstrate the metaphoric quality of these terms.3 A look at the different meanings that 'force' has had from Newton to the present will reveal its performance as a metaphor. Even Newton himself held different views of 'force'. He thought that the concept was both the innate 'force' of momentum and the impressed 'force' of motion, concepts which are not consistent with each other. It is also fairly well known that Newton's gravitational 'force' is inconsistent with his I Cf. Earl R.

MACCORMAC laws of motion. Many contemporary textbooks treat Newton's second law of motion (f ma) as if it were a precise definition, but Newton clearly distinguished between definitions and axioms, relegating the second law to the latter rather than the former. Newton probably took the 'force' of the second law to be a concept given intuitively by analogy to man's muscular 'force'. In any event, it is clear that Newton held to several different concepts of 'force' of which that in the second law is only one among many. Since Newton, there has been an effort by scientists to eliminate the term 'force' as an unnecessary concept. Mach, Kirchhoff, and Hertz were all of this mind. In contemporary physics, 'force' plays the role of an inter mediate methodological term and, although possessing little explanatory power whatsoever, is still used in statics and dynamics. Quantum mechanics, by using the terms of classical mechanics, has also kept 'force' as a device for economy of thought, based upon analogy with the human body. General relativity led to a further revision of the concept, but this is presently in a confused state and the process is by no means complete. 'Force' seems to be an irreducible metaphor prevalent in many scientific theories and, yet, difficult if not impossible to reduce to an observation statement. Jammer notes that 'mass' has a similar status. Throughout its long history in human thought, from its early adumbrations in Neo-Platonic philosophy, its mystic and still inarticulate presentation in theology, to its scientific manifestation in the physics of Kepler and Newton, to its carefully thought out redefinitions in positivistic and axiomatic formulations, up to its far-reaching modifications in modern theories of physics,-nowhere does science seem to get full command and control over all the conceptual intricacies involved. One has to admit that in spite of the concerned effort of physicists and philo sophers, mathematicians and logicians, no final clarification of the concept of mass has been reached.' If there are numerous scientific metaphors that are not reducible to a literal paraphrase, and if scientific language is upheld as a paragon of meaningful language, then there can be no objection to the use of irreducible metaphors by theologians for such an objection would be both hypocritical and self-contradictory. And hypothetical metaphors used by scientists rarely can be directly reduced to statements capable of observation. Confirmation is, at best, indirect and involves the acceptance or rejection of an entire theory. Why, then, object to the use of irreducible metaphors by theologians? Religious language is not necessarily meaningless because it employs hypothetical metaphors that are not capable of reduction to literal and observable paraphrases. Religious metaphors must be judged in terms of the theological context in which they occur. Some experiential confirmation must be provided for that theology if it claims to possess any truth value, but not every statement of the theology must be confirmable, nor should 1 Jammer, Concepts of Mass in Classical and Modern Physics, p. 224.</page><page sequence="5">SCIENTIFIC AND RELIGIOUS METAPHORS 405 one count the use of an irreducible metaphor as the creation of nonsense. Paul Edwards' objection to irreducible metaphors not only would rob religion but science also of cognitive meaning. He states: When a sentence contains an irreducible metaphor, it follows at once that the sentence is devoid of cognitive meaning, that it is unintelligible, that it fails to make a genuine assertion. For what has happened is that the sentence has been deprived .of the referent it would have had, assuming that certain other conditions had also been fulfilled, if the expression in question had been used in its literal sense. To say that the metaphor is irreducible is to say in effect that no new referent can be supplied.' By this criterion, not only religion, but science would be filled with sentences 'devoid of cognitive meaning'. Scientists are quite happy to employ specu lative metaphors in theories since such hypotheses suggest possible explana tions. They know that only a very few observation statements can be generated by a theory and that these will often encounter negative as well as confirmatory evidence. Yet, scientists persist in holding such theories until they find an alternative theory that may be considered superior because it interprets the data better or is simpler as an explanation or offers more fruitful possibilities for experimentation.2 Theologians should take heed of these discoveries in the plhilosophy of science and not flinch when a critic finds an irreducible metaphor among their utterances. Such religious metaphors must be judged by the context in which they occur. The entire theology must be accepted or rejected by the few statements capable of confirmation produced by it. The second part of our argument finds fault with the very notion of an irreducible metaphor. If metaphors could not even be partially paraphrased, if we could not say by analogy what they were like in ordinary experience, then they would be unintelligible. And one of the major features of a metaphor is that we can comprehend the possibility which it suggests. If by 'irreducible', one means that no way exists to understand the metaphor by analogy to ordinary experience, then irreducible metaphors are not even metaphors but are unintelligible jibberish. If, however, by 'irreducible' one means that no exact paraphrase exists, then it becomes quite possible for irreducible metaphors to play a legitimate role in language, for this second delineation allows for the analogous interpretation of a metaphor in ordinary terms even though such an interpretation may not capture the full meaning of the metaphor. Critics of religious language have acted as if irreducible religious metaphors were entirely beyond the possibility of understanding, forgetting that 'irreducibility' might prohibit an exact paraphrase, but not necessarily prevent a partial interpretation by analogy. 1 Edwards, 'Paul Tillich's Confusions', pp. i99-200, also quoted by Burgess, 'Irreducible Religious Metaphors', p. 356. 2 Cf.

MACCORMAC Metaphors involve the juxtaposition of two referents which, if taken literally, would produce an absurd reading.1 Read literally, the metaphor appears as either a misuse of the language or as an actual contradiction. Upon initial hearing, we are surprised and even, perhaps, shocked by the new usage. If there is some way in which we can comprehend it, if some part of the juxtaposition seems to be a possible way of looking at things, then we recognise the word or words as a legitimate metaphor. We con sider what it would be like if the metaphor were a correct expression of a state of affairs. When a reporter describes the condition of the electorate in response to a ruthless and corrupt government as 'sheep before the slaughter', he does not mean, of course, that people are literally sheep but suggests that in many ways people are acting in a docile fashion like sheep. In this metaphor, we can see the analogy between the behaviour of people and the behaviour of sheep. But, as Max Black has pointed out in his interaction theory of metaphor, it might also make sense to see just what human traits sheep appear to have as it does to look at people as possessing sheep-like characteristics.2 The analogy between sheep and people enables the metaphor to express a way of describing experience. The first time that someone hears this metaphor, however, it may suggest rather than express a way of looking at things that he had never considered before. The metaphor 'man is a machine' is like that. For the average person, likening man to a machine may be a new and suggestive way of considering humanity, but to the researcher who has been studying neurophysiology it may be a commonplace expression. Many metaphors begin as shocking suggestions and, then, after we become familiar with them, they become more expressive and finally end up as everyday expressions in our language. These meta phors undergo a process of transition to ordinary language and just when that occurs is difficult to say, but that it does occur, can be attested by examining the descriptions of words given by dictionaries of different periods. Take the verb 'seed', for instance; at the time of Samuel Johnson's dictionary it applied only to plants and agriculture.3 Yet, by the mid-twentieth century, it had the further connotation of 'seeding clouds', meaning the process of dropping silver iodide or carbon dioxide particles into clouds in order to 1 Cf.

Note that I take similes and other grammatical forms to be included as metaphors. There and in this essay I draw upon standard sources for a tension theory of metaphor including: Douglas Berggren, 'The Use and Abuse of Metaphor: I and II', The Review of AMetaphysics, Vol. i6 (December I962), pp. 237-58, and (March I963), pp. 450-72; Max Black, Alodels and Aletaphors: Studies in Language and Philosophy (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, I962); Northrop Frye, Anatomy of Criticism: Four Essays (Princeton: Princeton University Press, I957); Colin Turbayne, The AMyth of Metaphor (New Haven: Yale University Press, I962); and Philip Wheelwright, Afetaphor and Reality (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, I962). 2 Max Black, 'Metaphor' in his AModels and AMetaphors. 3 Samuel Johnson, A Dictionary of the English Language (London: W. Strahan, I755), reprinted by AMS Press, Inc., New York, I967 under the entry for 'Seed'.</page><page sequence="7">SCIENTIFIC AND RELIGIOUS METAPHORS 407 produce precipitation.' If you told an eighteenth century farmer or someone in the twentieth century unacquainted with efforts to control the weather, that you were going to 'seed clouds', he would have thought you to be out of your mind, for seeding meant to him planting seeds in the ground not in clouds. Those who first described their activity of dropping particles into clouds as 'seeding' undoubtedly had the pictoral analogy in mind between dropping particles into clouds and dropping individual seeds into the ground. Those who hold that all metaphors must be reducible to ordinary language in order to be meaningful, seem only to consider expressive metaphors and to ignore metaphors that are more suggestive than expressive. Philip Wheel wright called the first kind of metaphor, that which had as its primary function the expression of experience, the 'ephphor'.2 He argued, however, that there was a second kind of metaphor, the 'diaphor', that suggested possible experience rather than expressing an analogy. We have already encountered this kind of metaphor in the concepts of 'force' and 'mass' and in the concept of 'God'. It is well known that poetry abounds in diaphors, metaphors that suggest interesting ways of looking at the world that very likely will not become ordinary discourse because they are so unusual and foreign to the usual perceptions that we have. But, there are no pure diaphors, for every metaphor must have some expressive element in it or we could not understand what is proposed by way of suggestion. A pure diaphor would be unintelligible. Nor can there be pure epiphors for if a metaphor had no suggestive quality, it would not shock us and would be an explicit analogy rather than a metaphor. Those who reject all diaphors as meaningless fail to examine the degree of suggestion and expression found in individual metaphors. While it is certainly true that many poetic metaphors find little analogy in our experience and offer imaginative suggestions, there are other diaphors that offer possible hypotheses. To distinguish among these metaphors let us examine several examples illustrating the degrees of expression found in them. Consider a metaphor found in John Dryden's 'A Song for Saint Cecelia's Day, November 22, I687'. From harmony, from heavenly harmony This universal frame began; When Nature underneath a heap Of jarring atoms lay, And could not heave her head, The tuneful voice was heard from high, Arise, ye more than dead. 1 Jess Stein, The Random House Dictionary of the English Language (New York: Random House, I967), p- I290 2 Philip Wheelwright, Metaphor and Reality, pp. 57 ff.</page><page sequence="8">4o8 EARL R. MACCORMAC The metaphor of nature as a body resting under a pile of solid irreducible atoms seems strange to us and yet we can understand both the metaphor and the image for we know what nature and a body are, and we can imagine nature as if it were a body. Yet, it is very unlikely that we shall reduce this metaphor to ordinary discourse, for it clashes with our modern under standing of nature as an impersonal force governed by scientific laws. Here is a diaphor that probably will not be reduced to a literal paraphrase since the anthropomorphic view suggested by Dryden varies so greatly with our normal way of viewing nature. There are other metaphors, however, that begin life as diaphors and then, when evidence appears that confirms what they suggest, they become epiphors. This has happened to a number of particles suggested by scientists. Initially, particles like the positron were proposed as highly speculative and hypothetical entities; they were diaphors in that if one took them literally in light of knowledge available at the time they were proposed, they were somewhat absurd suggestions. The positron, a particle with the same mass as the electron and yet with a positive electrical charge, seemed to be an anomaly. After Blackett and Occhialini had located the positron experimentally, it became an epiphor expressive of experience rather than primarily suggestive.' More recently, scientists have considered the possibility that there might be particles that travel faster than the speed of light.2 In view of Einstein's postulate of the speed of light as an absolute maximum, such an hypothesis seems to be an impossibility. Yet, consequences from Einstein's own equation used in his theory of special relativity warrant the consideration of this possibility. To talk about the hypothesis, scientists took a Greek word, 'tachyon', and infused it with properties foreign to most known particles. The tachyon presently represents a scientific diaphor which we can under stand, but which suggests an hypothesis impossible by present accepted scientific theory. One cannot reduce it to a literal and observable paraphrase since no experimental evidence exists for it. Nevertheless, it is not meaning less, contrary to the irreducibility thesis. We can understand a tachyon because it is based upon at least some analogy to that with which we are familiar, namely relativity theory. Our brief survey of metaphor shows that there are two types of metaphor, the epiphor expressive of experience, and the diaphor, more suggestive of possibilities. Some metaphors begin as diaphors, become epiphors when evidence or experience confirms their suggestion as plausible, and finally become part of ordinary language as dead metaphors. Other metaphors remain diaphors in that they suggest more than they express. Those proposing 1 Norwood Russell Hanson, The Conicept of the Positroni (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, I 963) - 2 Roger G.

For, as we have seen, even the most hypothetical diaphor must have some element of analogy to our experience or we will be unable to comprehend it. And there are degrees of plausibility among diaphors. The major question about irreducible religious metaphors is not whether they are meaningful or not, but the degree to which they are suggestive rather than expressive-another way of asking how close they are to diaphors rather than epiphors. Whether the statement 'God is love' be taken by a believer as an epiphor expressing his experience, or by a sceptic as a diaphor suggesting an unlikely possibility, both believer and sceptic have some sense of what the metaphor means, even though neither may be able to give an exact paraphrase of it in ordinary language. The term, 'God', really has a metaphoric quality in that it offers a number of suggestive possibilities. A glance at the history of Chirstian thought quickly reveals that this term has ranged from being a symbol for religious experience to a term referring to an anthropomorphic and transcendent being. Believers will not allow the metaphor 'God' to be reduced to a literal paraphrase for to do that would rob the concept of its tension and hypothetical status. Yet, to claim that it is a meaningless term because it remains irreducible, ignores the fact that all irreducible metaphors whether in science or religion, must have some expressive quality found in analogies with our own ex perience. The believer will claim that the irreducible metaphor, 'God', contains a higher degree of corroboration in his experience than the sceptic is willing to allow. The believer understands 'God' as a metaphor that partially expresses his experience and yet still remains suggestive and mysterious. The unbeliever views 'God' more as an imaginative and poetic suggestion, more of a diaphor. Both believer and unbeliever, however, can find irreducible religious metaphors like 'God' meaningful just as scientists can comprehend diaphors like 'force' and 'tachyon'. Our analysis has shown that if one applied the irreducibility thesis to scientific language in the way that it has been used to analyse religious language, then much of the necessary theoretical language of science would be indicted as meaningless. Careful attention to the nature of metaphor also reveals that irreducible metaphors cannot be unintelligible and, therefore, meaningless since all metaphors whether reducible or not depend upon some form of analogy with the hearer's experience if they are to be understood as metaphors. One can easily consider unlikely possibilities whether they be poetic, religious, or scientific. These metaphors are all intelligible and meaningful whether they are corroborated in full or not. The irreducibility thesis does not prove the futility of religious language at all; what it does do is to demonstrate its own inadequate understanding of the nature of metaphor.</page></plain_text>
