Can an ecological approach be used to solve a linguistic problem? One of the pur- poses of this paper is to find out. The subject was triggered by George L. Trager's article, 'Cottonwood' = 'Tree': a Southwestern Linguistic Trait,' in which he pointed out that a number of southwestern languages identify the name of this deciduous tree with the concept tree. A somewhat similar situation exists in the Dieguefio Indian language spoken in Southern California where there are separate names for each species of tree, shrub, or other plant. But there is no single word meaning tree as does the word in Eng- lish. The word the Dieguefo use generically for tree, /isnyaaw/, is actually the name of a particular species of oak, Quercus agrifolia, commonly known as the Coast or California Live Oak. Why has this word rather than any other come to be used to express the con- cept tree? This problem leads to other questions. Is there a classificatory system of flora and fauna in Dieguefo? Can the organization of such material show how the Dieguefio con- ceptualize their world? Finally, can such a study be conducted and answers obtained from previously published data? In attempting to answer these questions I have relied exclusively on published material, In Dell Hymes, Language in Culture and Society, New York (1964). most of which was originally gathered in the middle of the last century and first third of this one. In addition to searching the litera- ture on the Diegueno I have taken a good look at their close Shoshonean neighbors, especially the Luisefo and Cahuilla who share a similar habitat. Common names of plants are used but are further identified by their scientific and Dieguefio names (if known) at first mention. The Diegueno words are from a corpus of historical and current vocabulary I have been compiling for some years. 1. The Dieguefo are a Yuman speaking people of Hokan stock. Prehistorically they lived in San Diego and Imperial Counties in California and in Baja California, Mexico. Their western boundary was the Pacific Ocean. On the north they were bounded by the Luisefo, Cupefo, and Cahuilla. Barrows placed the northern boundary at Warner's Ranch where he found the population mixed Dieguefo and Cahuilla. On the south were the Yuman speaking tribes of Baja Cali- fornia. No one knows just how far south this boundary extended, but it must have been at least a hundred miles. Ownership of the desert areas around the Salton Sea and Imperal Valley has not been estab- lished.2 The people were organized into non- totemic exogamous clans with patrilocal residence. They practiced a hunting and gathering economy. Because they had a fairly dependable stable food source close at hand they were able to remain more or less in one locality, moving about within a spe- 2For prehistoric areas of the Dieguefo see A.

They lived in an area encompassing three Life Zones: Lower Sonoran, Upper Sonoran, and Transitional. 1.1. A look at the subsistence pattern shows that the Dieguefio did not lack for a variety of foods. More work has been done on this subject among the Luisefio, and Cahuilla than among the Dieguefo, but since all three groups occupied somewhat similar ecological niches, some of the data can also be accepted for the Dieguefio. Ray- mond White, in his Luisefio study,3 charts the principal foods for both coastal and in- terior groups. For the inland people he gives the following foods and proportions of the total diet: acorns 25-50 %; seeds 15-25 %; greens 10-15 %; bulbs, roots, and fruits 10- 15%; game 15-25 % and fish and marine animals 0-5 %. For the coastal groups the consumption of seeds, greens, acorns, and game was slightly lower, but fish and marine animals played a much more important part in the diet. For desert dwellers mesquite was probably more important than acorns. Thus, the most important single item of food, the staple in the diet, was the acorn, followed by seeds and game and to a lesser degree, bulbs, roots, fruits, and greens with fish negligible inland but important on the coast. At this point it is tempting to jump to the conclusion that here is the answer to the question. Since the acorn was the staple food the oak was a likely candidate for the title tree. Unfortunately it is not s( simple. Obvi- ously the oak tree was very important to the Dieguefio, but the favorite food acorn was not /isnyaaw/ but /kopal/. Six different oaks thrive within Dieguefio territory. Not all were equally desirable. As a food source there was a definite order of preference. 1. BLACK OAK (Quercus Kelloggii; Diegu- efo: /kopal/) was prefered because it had a gelatinous quality when cooked and be- cause it yielded most meat per acorn; 3 R. C. White, Luisefio Social Organization, UCPAAE, Vol 48, 91-194 (1963). 2. COAST LIVE OAK (Quercus agrifolia; Dieguefio: /isnyaaw/) was most widespread and second choice when the Black Oak crop was insufficient; 3. CANYON LIVE OAK (Quercus chryso- lepsis; Dieguefio: /samtay/); 4. ENGELMAN OAK (Quercus Engelmannii); 5. INTERIOR LIFE OAK (Quercus Wisli- zenii); 6. SCRUB OAK (Quercus dumosa; Dieguefio: /iswup/) was said to have the best flavor al- though it was considered less desireable for other reasons. Small quantities were added for flavoring purposes. Several of these species might actually occur in the same grove.4 Other plants in common use by the Diegu- efio were agave (Agave deserti Engelm.; Dieguefio: /amul/), yucca (Yucca Whippleii Torr.; Dieguefio: /sha'aa/) mesquite (Pro- sopsis julifora; Dieguefio: /anal/), screw- beans (Prosopsis pubescens Benth.), pinyon nuts (Pinus quadrifolia; Dieguefo :/xwiyu/), chia (Salvia Columbariae Benth.; Dieguefio: /upsil/) and other seeds, manzanita berries (Arctostaphylos species; Dieguefio: /xaasil/), elderberries (Sambucus coerulea Raf.; Die- guefio: /k'pul/), and wild plums (Prunus virginiana L. var. demissa; Dieguefio: /ax- kay/ and Prunus emarginata; Dieguefio: /itut/). This partial list is representative of the plant foods used. Barrows discovered at least sixty products used for nutrition and twenty-eight additional ones used as nar- cotics, stimulants or medicines by the Ca- huilla. 4 The different oaks, their uses, and occurrences are discussed by L. Bean and K. Saubel, Cahuilla Ethnobotanical Notes: The Aboriginal Use of the Oak, Archeological Survey Annual Report, UCLA, Los Angeles (1961); E. B. Higgins, Annotated Distributional List of the Ferns and Flowering Plants of San Diego County, California, San Diego (1949); P. A. Munz and D. D. Keck, A California Flora, Berkeley (1963).

XXXIV</page><page sequence="3">NO. 1 DIEGUERO TREE: AN ECOLOGICAL APPROACH TO A LINGUISTIC PROBLEM Although fewer animals were utilized for food, meat was an important item in the Diegueno diet. Small game included rabbits, woodrats, and quail. Deer were the impor- tant large game, and though never considered a major part of Diegueno diet, they were nevertheless sought after. Big horn sheep must have been a major meat source for the desert people, and antelope were also numer- ous at that time. 1.2. Turning from a consideration of the Indian diet to an examination of how these foods were obtained leads to a study of the economic resources of the people. Clearly the oak tree was the single most important re- source from a subsistence viewpoint. Not only was the acorn the staple food, but other by-products of the oak were sought after. Acorns served as bait in traps for small animals. Women used them in juggling games and strung them for necklaces. The leaves of the oak were their mattresses. Oak wood produced the finest, hottest fire for cooking and for warmth. Both ashes and bark were used medicinally. Acorn cups made a black dye, and oak bark was em- ployed in tanning and dying buckskin. Acorn groves were preferred camping spots because the branches of the trees provided shelter. Moreover, acorns could be traded for an- other food. Such trade was not limited to Dieguefios. To a considerable degree the oak tree was a year round resource. 1.3. An examination of the times at which the various foods were available for harvest reveals an interesting pattern. Food could be gathered almost year round. In April agave and yucca stalks budded out. In May and June chia and other seed plants were ready for gathering. In June and July wild plums ripened. During July and August the highly prized elderberries were harvested. Throughout June, July, and August mesquite could be gathered in some form. From Sep- tember on pinyons and acorns were ready. October and November were the customary times for the acorn harvest. This was just before or at the beginning of the rainy season since it was important that the acorns be gathered before they became wet. Among the animal resources the flesh of rabbits was used for food and the skins for rabbitskin robes. The large number of skins required to make one robe suggests that many rabbits were taken. Woodrats were a major meat source. They were taken in one of two ways, either by trapping with acorns for bait or by setting fire to their brush pile nests. As the animals came out they were shot with bow and arrow. There were desig- nated areas for this, and a number of smoke clouds might be seen in one area at the same time. Little material is available on hunting techniques for Bighorn sheep or antelope, but there is good information on deer habits.5 It is noteworthy that from Decem- ber through August the deer diet consists of grass, forbs, and browse, but that from September into December the preferred food is acorns, particularly Black Oak acorns. This means that the deer were at the higher elevations and in the oak groves at the same time the Indians were there. Since the acorn harvest required a stay of from three to four weeks in the groves, and since small game as well as deer were usually abundant in the area, the men hunted these animals during their stay in the groves. 1.4. That there was a monthly or seasonal pattern of harvesting food resources is ap- parent. It is important to examine the ge- ographical distribution as well. Oak of one species or another is found at almost every elevation. To consider only the distribution today would be misleading because it has been recorded that oaks were far more numerous in earlier times. A glance at the distribution of the plants already mentioned shows a wide overall range. Agave occurs in desert foothills at relatively low elevations. Yucca is found on sunny slopes. A second variety is found in the 5 J. T. Light, Jr., Limited Big Game Manage- ment Plan, Ms by U. S. Forest Service, Dept. of Agriculture (1965). 11</page><page sequence="4">INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AMERICAN LINGUISTICS southern part of the territory. Chia, perhaps the most important seed plant, is widespread. Wild Cherry grows in the Cuyamaca Mountains. Choke Cherry is found in the mountains and down to eleven hundred feet. Holly-leaved Cherry and Desert Apri- cot occur in the desert foothills in the ex- treme southeastern part of San Diego County. Elderberries are found all the way from the coast to the eastern edge of the mountains. Mesquite occurs widely in desert washes. Pinyon is found on desert slopes of the Laguna Mountains and into Baja California. The various species of oaks are widespread. Even the Cahuilla, whose land is seventy- five percent desert or chaparral, could find oak within ten miles of most village sites. Black Oak is found in the higher elevations of the Cuyamaca and Laguna mountains. The Coast or California Live Oak, /isn- yaaw/, is common on shaded slopes and in valleys from near the coast into the moun- tains. Another variety is found to the east and into Baja California. This oak has the widest distribution of any of the county and is found at almost every elevation. Canyon Oak occurs in the Cuyamaca and Laguna mountains and occasionally follows the streams into lower regions. Engelman Oak is fairly common on open slopes. The In- terior Live Oak grows in chaparral forma- tions in the Lagunas. Scrub Oak is abundant in chaparral except near San Diego. The distribution of the various plants made it possible to move from one area to another to exploit each resource in turn. Wild life also occurred in each area so that hunters could search out this food at the same time. Raymond White has shown for the Luisefio that their food sources followed a vertical pattern. As an ecological segment, the alignment of a rancheria runs contrary to the present agri- cultural scheme. By nature, the latter is vir- tually horizontal; the rancheria on the other hand is vertical for reasons just as compelling. The sierra and riverine terrain comprise a territory marked generally by three different vegetation characteristics. The stream valleys contain most of the water and corresponding vegetation; the steeper hillsides are covered with native chaparral; the upper reaches with flats and saddles ... were marked by the best oak groves. Foodstuffs matured at different seasons in the different altitudes, further con- tributing to a vertical ecological arrangement. Thus, each rancheria is composed of several definite topological units, arranged so that all necessary types of terrain are included within its boundaries. This same pattern seems to hold true for the Dieguefio where the lower elevations provided "sites ideally suited for the early spring growth of bulbs, tubers, reeds, buds, berries, and greens. These were readily ex- ploited from the village site. As the summer and early autumn ripened the seeds and berries in the chaparral, the emphasis and direction of the gathering activities shifted ... acorns were gathered in late autumn." 6 That the use of certain areas was reserved for a particular group seems indicated. If for some reason, such as local crop failure, a group wanted to harvest acorns in another's groves, it was necessary to get permission. A woman possessed one or more mortars for grinding acorns. These were located in the groves and could be either bedrock or porta- ble. They were considered hers alone and could be used only by herself or closely re- lated kinswomen. With the subsistence and economic pat- terns in mind the system may now be tested by considering the data with relation to spe- cific Dieguefno lineages and localities. For this only two areas will be examined, one Southern and the other Northern Dieguefo. The Southern Dieguefo lineage selected is Kwamay which was located by Spier. They occupied at least a dozen sites along Valleci- tos Creek into the Laguna Mountains and westward to Pine Valley. The Kwamay were one of the larger clans. Their occupation of each area was seasonal. In the winter they 6 White, op. cit., p 116; 120-21. 12 VOL. XXXIV</page><page sequence="5">NO. 1 DIEGUENO TREE: AN ECOLOGICAL APPROACH TO A LINGUISTIC PROBLEM lived among the foothills of the Colorado Desert. "In the spring they returned to the moun- tains, keeping pace with the ripening of the wild food staples, and passing the summer in their respective territories, where they lived in little groups around the valleys. The whole territory was not occupied at one time; when a locality was hunted out or fruits ripened elsewhere, they moved on. In the course of a year or so, however, all of the recognized settlements would have been occupied." 7 Within their territory the Kwamay had access to all of the plant and animal life dis- cussed previously. For the Northern Dieguefio the lineages generally considered as living at Mesa Grande were Critcak, KwiLp, and U'u. However, these clans lived at Mesa Grande only during the summer. In the winter they were at Pamo. Pamo is about nine hundred feet above sea level, Mesa Grande is thirty- three hundred feet. Pamo was about nine miles downstream from Mesa Grande and was the real home of those Indians who now live at Mesa Grande. Every necessary re- source must have been available within a short distance and rise in elevation. In addi- tion to the higher elevations needed for the oaks, this area was deeply chiseled by Santa Ysabel Creek as it dropped down from the mountains to the valley. In wide damp places reeds and other useful plants grew. Large boulders were pockmarked with bed- rock mortars. It could be further demonstrated that other Dieguefo lineages occupied similar ecological niches. Although every resource might not occur in each area, a sufficient number would to make the pattern hold true. 2. To return to the original problem, why was /isnyaaw/ among all possible trees se- lected to be the one used for the concept 7 Dieguefio lineages are discussed and located by Spier, op. cit. p. 306 and also by Gifford, op. cit., p 172. tree? Surely the oak was the most important plant resource of the Dieguefio. While /isnyaaw/, the Coast Live Oak, was not con- sidered the most desirable food acorn, in times of scarcity or failure of the /kopal/ crop, it was used in quantity. Moreover, the oak was economically of value for various non-food uses. A glance at the distribution shows that while different oaks occurred in different localities, one species could be found almost anywhere from coast to near desert and from the northern limits of the area well into Baja California. No matter in which area a Dieguefio lived, from desert slope to coastal plain, /isnyaaw/ occurred within his territory and was functionally important. He might have to travel for miles for the pre- ferred /kopal/ acorn, but when that crop failed or was unattainable, /isnyaaw/ was usually readily available for food, bedding, firewood, or medicinal purposes. It seems logical that this name should be used for tree when the need arose. By using an ecological approach, it has been possible to suggest a solution to this problem and in addition to learn something of the economic and subsistence patterns of these people and how they exploited the resources of the particular niche they oc- cupied. An additional problem is involved. Assum- ing that the ecological situation at the time the Dieguefno were first contacted was as described above, there is still no proof that this was the actual linguistic situation before white contact. It is possible that prior to European contact the Dieguefo used only individual species names instead of generic terms. A deeper search into the past would be required for an absolute answer, but re- gardless of when /isnyaaw/ first began to be used as a generic term, the reason remains the same. A somewhat similar situation appears to exist concerning the word dog /xat/. /xat/ has also been recorded for animal and for horse. Deer /kwak/ might seem to be a more logical choice when a word was needed for 13</page><page sequence="6">INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AMERICAN LINGUISTICS horse. Again, it seems to have been the ani- mal that was most closely associated with the Indian, the readily available dog which was to become the generic animal. Both the dog and horse were domestic animals, closely associated with man. 3. The foregoing suggests other possibili- ties-to discover whether or not the Die- guefio organized plant and animal life ac- cording to a classificatory system. As a pre- liminary it is necessary to find out how they perceived their universe. Only by under- standing their assumptions and concepts can one see the world as they saw it. The language itself gives the first clue. There are very few generic terms. Each species is separately named. The above men- tioned tree and animal are two of the rare generic terms. How they came to be has already been discussed. Flower /tapch/ is perhaps another. /isa/ is the word for bird. However, this may be another instance of a species name being expanded. Hooper cited /iseL/ in Cahuilla as a particular kind of bird with a yellow breast. Although Cahuilla is a Shoshonean language, it is a neighbor of Dieguefio, and other instances of borrow- ing have occurred. Sparkman finds that generic terms are the exception in Luisefio also, but some do occur.8 A search of the literature shows that the Dieguefio do view their world in a particular fashion. They place all flora and fauna in one of two classes: Tipay or non-Tipay. Tipay means person, and anything Tipay is con- sidered human. If something is Tipay it can speak to certain persons who can in turn speak to that which is Tipay. Shamans are such people. Gifford, referring to the mourn- ing dove, said, "It was called a tipai (person), because certain souls of the cremated dead were believed to be incarnate in these birds." 9 Forde wrote, "The owl is regarded with reverence and awe for the souls of the 8 P. S. Sparkman, The Culture of the Luiseno Indians, UCPAAE Vol 20 (1908). 9 Gifford, op. cit. p 48. dead can return among the houses of the living in the guise of an owl and lure living souls... with them to the land of the dead." 10 The following were considered Tipay or human. Birds: crow, dove, eagle, flicker, horned owl, hummingbird, mockingbird, owl, raven, roadrunner, turkey vulture, white pelican, wild pigeon, woodpecker, and yellow- hammer. Animals: coyote, fox, tree squirrel, rattlesnake, skunk, wildcat. Plants: quinine weed, white sage, wild plum, all bushes. These were known to be non-Tipay. Birds: duck, lark, quail, robin, passerine dove. Animals: beetle, deer, dog, grass- hopper, snakes other than rattlesnake, and woodrat."l An additional distinction was made. Animals that were Tipay could not be eaten. Spier quoted his informant as saying, "The dove is a person (tipai), but he is disliked. Still this is similar to eating a human being." 12 Those that were not Tipay were eaten freely. There seem to be two excep- tions. Dogs are not Tipay, but they are not eaten. They are individually named and are addressed by name. Among the neighboring Cahuilla they are considered to have souls. Some Tipay creatures such as doves, wild- cats, and rattlesnakes are occasionally eaten by old people, who, as they say, are going to die soon anyway. Although Tipay animals are not eaten, they may be killed. The eagle, the most important bird, was killed sacrificially. How- ever, the body was not eaten nor thrown to the dogs because it was a Tipay. It was buried, not cremated. Although bushes are Tipay, their fruit plays an important part in the diet. In Dieguefio the fruit of any plant, including the oak, is named the same as the plant. 10C. D. Forde, Ethnography of the Yuma Indians, UCPAAE Vol 28 (1931). 1 Tipay and non-Tipay classifications were compiled from L. Hooper, The Cahuilla Indians, UCPAAE Vol 16 (1920); and from Gifford, Spier, and Sparkman. 12 Op. cit. p. 336. 14 VOL. XXXIV</page><page sequence="7">NO. 1 DIEGUENO TREE: AN ECOLOGICAL APPROACH TO A LINGUISTIC PROBLEM To trace these concepts to their starting point it is necessary to examine Dieguefio origin myths. All the animals created in the beginning were human at that time, and most have remained so. The feathers used in every ceremony (initiation, mourning, dances) all came from Tipay birds. The numerous accounts of the origin vary in many details, but all are unanimous in bestowing anthropomorphic qualities on the important animal characters. They converse with humans and possess souls and spirits. The Dieguefio believed an individual could possess up to four souls, but whether this trait applied to Tipay animals was not made clear. 4. That at least a preliminary classifica- tory system can be worked out for Dieguefio flora and fauna is now clear, but the goal of the present study is not merely to establish the categories as an end in themselves but as a starting point to use in the search for a meaningful interpretation of the social organization. As a step in this direction, knowing some- thing of how the Dieguefio conceptualize their universe, we might tentatively explore the various Tipay animals and birds to see how (or if) their classification in this taboo group is functionally important. Eagles and their nests appeared to be owned and could not be hunted. This possibly functioned to insure a sufficient number of these important and none too abundant birds for ceremonial purposes. The human quality of owls tended to reinforce the concept of soul loss. To return to the opening questions, all have been at least partially answered. The ecological approach made possible the demonstration of how /isnyaaw/ came to be used for tree. The underlying assumptions for a taxonomy of flora and fauna have been postulated, all from bits and pieces of published data, none of which was originally gathered specifically for such a study. It is possible to rework material gathered for other purposes to gain new insights into some more current problem. 15</page></plain_text>
