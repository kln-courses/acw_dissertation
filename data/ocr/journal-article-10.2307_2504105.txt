<plain_text><page sequence="1">HUIIZiNGA AS ACCUSER OF HIS AGE 8 PIETER GEYL Huizinga I was a notable figure in the Dutch, and even in the wider Western, life of his time. None of our Dutch historians has been so much read and so much admired. At the same time he irritated many and was sharply attacked. His fascination is by no means spent. Even now one can surrender with delight to the pictures he creates, one can both learn from and enjoy the sparkling of his intellect; then again one feels repelled by his prejudice or wonders how it could dominate this subtle mind to that extent. An un- common and an important personality he remains. I say this at the outset so emphatically because I am going to approach him from the side that rouses me to opposition. Those charges against our time in which he indulged especially in the years of crisis before and during the Second World War, and which procured him an entirely novel reputation with the public at large, seemed to me at the time already to be missing their mark, inspired as they were by personal feelings of unease, historically and politically unwarranted. A thorough reo reading has confirmed me in this opinion, and it will be the starting point of this paper. Next I shall ask myself how these prejudices and these personal sentiments are to be explained. In looking back on his earlier work we shall find that they were present in his mind from the beginning; in which pecu- liarities, in which general attitude towards life and society did they have their roots? A further analysis of his general outlook - at first more particularly in connection with the severe criticisms levelled against him from three sides in 1930 - will then occupy the two concluding sections. I In 1935 there appeared In de schaduwen van morgen (In the Shadows of Tomorrow). Our world was living under the double menace of Communism, * This essay, which is to be included in the author's Encounters in History (London: Collins, 1963), appeared originally in Dutch, Huizinga als aanklager van zijn tijd (Am- sterdam: Akademie van Wetenschappen, 1961). One section has been omitted here.

And now here appeared the famous historian - the scholar, or at times it seemed more like the esthete, the man playing with beautiful forms and subtle ideas - and threw this book into the fearful tension of the moment like a loud cry of anguish. "A diagnosis of the spiritual distemper of our age", so ran the subtitle. The book drew an enormous amount of attention. The first edition was sold out almost at once; in 1938 appeared the seventh, and by then translations into nine languages were spread over Europe. The book has indeed uncommon qualities. It is written vividly. The anxieties of the present are taken up in a broad argument, which could not but impress by the inexhaustible erudition of the author, not a mere expert in his particular branch of study, but apparently at home in all fields of the mind. What a power of observation, what an ever ready adequacy of ex- pression, and how did he not seem, with quiet authority, to reveal undreamt- of depths! And at the same time there rose from the book a profounder tone of true concern and sacred conviction. The scholar as warning prophet and guide towards salvation. It is small wonder that he was avidly read by countless disquieted and bewildered readers. Huizinga envisaged the crisis through which the world was going as an exclusively cultural crisis. It was culture, our own, our Western culture, which had lost its bearings and seemed to be making for disaster. And to avert that happening? Yes, for that, too, there was nothing but that we should reform ourselves, our attitude of mind, our spiritual life. Was the diagnosis correct? Would the cure he indicated prove effective, was it even practicable? Banning, whose own view of the book was critical, spoke at the time of "the uncritical veneration and the disgusting yapping" with which it had been received. The profoundest word came from Verwey 2. In his last pub- lished article the great poet and critic wrote in the monthly journal Het Kouter of 1936 that "Being Distempered with the Age" - this was the title of the article, in which Huizinga is not mentioned by name - "with some of our contemporaries, and not the least, takes on forms which seem to me regrettable." They lament "the decline of what they regard as culture." Verwey then dismisses the indulging in thoughts of ruin, melancholy cogita- tions, and discouragements, as poisonous weeds. And he says: "I esteem of 2 W. Banning, b. 1888, 'modernist' Reformed minister, Professor of Sociology in the University of Leyden 1946-1958; a leading figure among religious-minded Socialists. Albert Verwey, 1865-1937, poet and critic, leader of a group associated with his periodical De Beweging, 1905-19; Professor of Dutch Literature in the University of Leyden 1924-35.</page><page sequence="3">HUIZINGA AS ACCUSER OF HIS AGE 233 importance only those minds - they need by no means be great minds - who resist these sorrowings and unconditionally believe and confide in the powers, first defensive then creative, of the human mind." A confidence, it is true, which is not presented to us as the result of scholarly investigation; an unconditional belief. But will not critical reason admit that it constituted an element of culture of greater constructive capacity than did the equally preconceived pessimism of which Huizinga made himself the spokesman? They were indeed terrible years, the years in which our lives were then cast. But one should think (so it looks from the vantage point of the present, and so it did look to more realistic minds then) that the crisis was embodied in Stalin, Mussolini, Hitler. And to explain them it is plainly necessary to adduce the particular circumstances of their environment and of their period. With not one word, however, does Huizinga allude to these. Was he aware of what was being done in deadly earnest and being prepared across the frontier? One is almost inclined to doubt it when one sees how in his letter to Benda of December 1933 he had noticed only the folly of it all. Certainly, he realized the dangers of nationalism, so he then wrote to the man who, in denouncing "la trahison des clercs", had wanted to have all nations dissolved at one blow into the universal state (where - significantly - French was to be used as the cultural language ... ). But, says Huizinga, remember: "His- tory, and the advantages of diversity!" I agree wholeheartedly. However, he went on, he at other times so inclined to take the gloomy view: "Have patience. The nationalism that you abhor is about to collapse in ridicule." And in his conclusion once again: "The excesses of a demented nationalism which the closing year has witnessed will conduct it to absurdity and ridicule." So he directs his indictment - as I already said - against our own culture. It is from its decay that all our troubles result. Culture, so he begins his argument, can exist only on condition that there exists a certain equilibrium between spiritual and material values. This equilibrium is now disturbed. Culture must be oriented ethically and metaphysically. "Thus, earlier pe- riods had as their generally accepted ideal: the honor of God, however that might be interpreted, justice, virtue, wisdom." For this has been sub- stituted that which divides rather than unites: "Well-being, power, safety ... all proceeding directly from the natural instinct, unrefined by the spirit. The caveman already knew these ideals." The victories of technique and of organization are celebrated. Huizinga is ready to admit that there is something impressive in the astonishing progress of the natural sciences, but the result- ing material progress can drag a civilization to its ruin. On the basis of popular education, politics can by means of organization and propaganda work destruction. Is the effect of popular education in itself so educative? does it not detract from, rather than add to, the people's wisdom? Popular thinking, so he believes, is actually going through a crisis full of dangers of corruption. Judgment has been weakened. The average member of the</page><page sequence="4">234 PIETER GEYL community has allowed the obtrusive culture apparatus and the cheap mass product to flatten and expropriate his notions, unfortified as they are by any more than superficial knowledge. The cinema Huizinga sees as playing a maleficent role in that process; and the radio no less. The critical turn of mind has declined. The cult of life has an anticultural tendency, for a culture of high quality must in a certain sense be oriented towards death. The state exacts adoration, to the detriment of all independence. Moral norms are consequently weakened, especially where actions by or on the authority of the state are involved. Where Nelson before Trafalgar appealed to "duty", men are now spurred to fanaticism with "heroism", and an ever more prevalent puerilism is put to use. The present-day theory of race proves, acording to Huizinga, that men no longer listen to the veto of criti- cism. Cultural evidence of the decline is supplied by the loss of style and by the inroads of irrationalism. "We witness the worst culmination of combined dangers that can threaten our culture. We have entered a state of affairs characterized by weakened resistance to infection and intoxication. The mind is being spilt. The means of exchange of thought, the word, is inevitably losing value as this develop- ment proceeds. It is distributed in ever more immoderate quantities ever more easily ... Feelings of responsibility, seemingly strengthened by the slogan of heroism, have been torn from their base in the individual conscience and are being mobilized for the benefit of every collectivity that wishes to elevate its narrow view to be a canon of salvation and attempts to enforce its will . .." It is all very eloquent, and the admonitions deserve being taken to heart. But most of the charges put forward, and the worst of them, related in fact only to the countries where totalitarianism had triumphed. That cult of heroism, for example - Huizinga illustrates it with high-sounding placards he had seen in Italy. Did he expect that in Holland the N.S.B.3 was going to win? When speaking of state absolutism and the subjection of moral judgment to the interest of the state, he quotes Carl Schmitt, one of the theoreticians of National-Socialist public and international law, the inventor of the friend-enemy formula. But he does not add the comment that this was a concomitant of the infatuation then reigning in Germany, and that not only he Huizinga, but we, we Westerners, with the exception of some few unbalanced or disgruntled individuals, still - heaven be praised - see things in a different light. We heard him about the racial doctrine as a proof of a decline of the critical faculty. Had we succumbed to it? The moral sense in its entirety seems to him to have been affected in the centre of its strength, and, after first quoting some more German instances, he mentions as the profoundest cause its relativation inherent in Marx's historical materialism. 3 N.S.B.: Nationaal Socialistische Beweging (Movement) in Holland.</page><page sequence="5">HUIZINGA AS ACCUSER OF HIS AGE 235 Freud's influence he considers to be equally pernicious. And as an illustra, tion he then quotes from a little textbook of morality with the aid of which the young Soviet citizen is educated. The young Soviet-citizen? I am not surprised, but did not Huizinga know that in our own country the Socialist Party was just freeing itself from the shackles of Marxism? Striking evi- dence, indeed, that our society and culture still disposed of a good deal of resisting power on their own account. By lumping together the Western world, to which he himself belonged with the whole of his being, and the countries that had fallen under totali- tarian regimes, Italy, Germany, Russia, Huizinga committed a grave method- ological error which falsified his "diagnosis of the spiritual distemper of our time" from the start. The error was more than a fortuitous lapse. It was connected with funda- mental peculiarities of his attitude towards life and the world. All through his oeuvre one can observe an unwillingness to bring into account, when dealing with the cultural process, economic factors and also the purely political ones of the state and of the struggle for power. Culture was to him the service of what is nobler and more beautiful as it is carried on by a small elite. In this way he saw the cultural process as it were in isolation, obeying its own impulses, realizing its own essence. I shall try to explain this attitude of mind later on. Here I observe only that it appears not only in his diagnosis but also in the treatment he recommended.4 For indeed - as I hinted before - he did point to a road of escape from the threat of ruin. He did so, one suspects, more from a sense of obligation not to give way to despair than from genuine conviction firmly rooted in his soul. It was a road, indeed, which to a sober eye like mine loses itself in metaphysical and illusionist mists. To him the only means of salvation was to reduce life to greater sobriety and simplicity, asceticism; men of their free will would have to renounce the superfluous and the meaningless with which life has come to be encumbered. For domestic relations within each separate country he sees a promise in the organic idea: a division springing naturally from pre-existing units. He dreams of a return (for that is what it would have to be) to "a noble relationship of service" so that the individual might, each "in his class", feel at home in the community and would there, "in his place", be happy in being "himself". In that way the foundations of culture would be stabilized. This is no more than dreaming, and also, the suggestion that Europe would come back to the Christian faith and at the same time learn 4 In his oration on the occasion of his transferring the rectorate of the University of Groningen, In de laagvlakten der cultuur (In the Plains of Culture), 1960, Professor P. J. Bouman, a sociologist, points to the exclusivist character of Huizinga's conception of culture in which only "the higher" is taken into account. Bouman then quotes some passages to show that Huizinga has occasionally "wavered as to whether he should not adopt a more comprehensive view", and adds: "Modern scholarly thinking is moving i] the direction of a very wide, practically all-embracing, conception of culture."</page><page sequence="6">236 PIETER GEYL to recognize the "rightness" of Islam and the "profundity" of the Orient (it is as if we were listening to Toynbee) does not impress one as more than a pious wish. But the high point of unrealism is reached in the solution he suggests for the international tensions which were soon to rend the world: "a far-reaching international benevolence." Indeed. . . "If only all men were wise"; if only the world were quite other than in fact it is . . . But let us return for a moment to the diagnosis. In support of it, Huizinga constantly draws comparisons with the past. With an - one would almost say, wilfully - idealized past. Here his feeling out of tune with his own time led him to commit a second methodological error. Or is it a fact that older periods present so luminous, for us so shaming, a contrast to the shortcomings of the present that we heard him enumerate? I could demonstrate, point by point, that while he paints the present in the darkest colors, where earlier times are concerned he contents himself with those convenient generalities under which imperfections, weaknesses, and abuses can remain withdrawn from our observation. When, for instance, he speaks of the honor of God, or of an orientation towards death, I feel driven to ask whether the average human being was ever touched so deeply by religion even when religion was far more indisputably powerful than it is now. We should in any case remember how little it was able to restrain the human vices of earlier generations. But Huizinga in his comparison never mentions this fact. When, to what according to him was so stabilizing and elevating a force in ancient times, a respect for "the honor of God", he adds the words however that might be interpreted, he glides indeed lightly over the religious differences which in the past used to give rise to ruinous divisions. The evils happening around us today do not let themselves be relegated so unobtrusively to the background. Although - and I notice this in passing because it is so characteristic5 - Huizinga himself in "diagnosing the dis- temper of our times" does not devote one word to the evil of unemployment which had assumed such terrific proportions at that very moment. His readers at any rate might easily allow themselves to be dazzled by the beautiful appearance of earlier stages of culture which he conjured up before them. Yet if he had searched the past for symptoms of folly and of spiritual or intellectual sloth as industriously as he did the present, how often should we have had reason to be surprised that Western civilization did not succumb long ago! For truly, there has never been a lack of iniquities and human deficiencies. History is largely made up of them. But - to use a word of Toynbee's for once - these shortcomings have always had the effect of 5 Banning drew attention to this in the article in Het Kouter cited above.-It is true that H. in his subtitle spoke of "the spiritual suffering" (suffering is a more literal trans- lation than distemper used in the title of the book when it appeared in English in 1935), but did not unemployment have depressing and demoralizing effects in a spiritual sense?</page><page sequence="7">HUIZINGA AS ACCUSER OF HIS AGE 237 challenges, and it is in struggling with them that the succeeding generations have confirmed our culture. Why should not the present generation do likewise? Verwey was right in pointing to Huizinga's lack of faith in the human mind as his fundamental error. In the Shadows of Tomorrow was not Huizinga's last word on the subject. Again and again, in endless variations, he gave expression to the same ideas, with respect to both diagnosis and cure. Shortly before - I am confining myself for the moment to the 'thirties - he had already spoken in the same strain in a chapter "The Crisis of Culture" of his little book Nederlands Geestesmerk (Characteristic of the Dutch Mind). Shortly after The Shadows he wrote a lecture Der Mensch und die Kultur, which was meant to be read at Vienna in 1938; in April 1940 he published, in the Fortnightly Review, an article "Conditions for the Recovery of Civilization". In between there had been a radio talk, "Neutrality and Freedom, Truth and Culture", broad- cast in November 1939 (this was the only time that Huizinga let himself be heard through that pernicious instrument). In 1938 his great work Homo Ludens had been published, about which more in a moment. In 1941, that is to say during the occupation of Holland, he read a paper for the Academy at Amsterdam, entitled "On Change of Form in History". In it he contended that American history had become unpresentable to the imagination (in- capable of being pictured) ever since the Civil War, because of, among other things, the dominance of the economic motive, and that the history of the rest of the world was moving in the same direction.6 I cannot see in these speculations anything but a crass manifestation of his aversion to the modern age. He compares this chaotic present, not with the equally chaotic reality of the past, but with the presentations of the latter as they have assumed form in the course of time and become current. Finally, he wrote during his exile in De Steeg, one more, fairly extensive, essay, Geschonden wereld (Violated World), which was not published until after his death and after the war. It is worth noticing how he clung to his opinions even while events went on their ever more violent course. The paper Der Mensch und die Kultur could not be read in Vienna because unhappy Austria had fallen into the clutches of Hitler just before. Nevertheless, Huizinga would not hear of any "cultural schism", the term which seemed to many to sum up the situation, and he published his lecture unaltered, now that Austria had been enslaved, in Switzerland. "This pretended cultural schism is to a large extent no more than politically conditioned manufacture." Politically conditioned? That 6 The assertion is disproved-to mention one instance out of many-by the splendid work of A. M. Schlesinger Jr., The Age of Roosevelt (three volumes published 1957, '58, '60). The economic motive plays an important role in this story, no doubt. But the author is constantly making us see the men, while the figure of F. D. Roosevelt dominates the scene. No question of "change of form".</page><page sequence="8">238 PIETER GEYL means apparently to him as much as to say: has nothing to do with culture. So here, too, he offers his specific: simplification of life, asceticism, and the rest. In the Fortnightly even, at a moment when his Engish readers were at war, he tells them imperturbably that "international good faith" is the solution and that it cannot exist without Christianity. (Because there had been no rivalries, no breaches of faith, and no wars in the Christian centuries? . . ) After the restoration of peace the world would be encumbered with genera- tions spoilt by a lying propaganda. So, once more: sobriety, etcetera. In the radio talk of November 1939 he had indeed assured the Dutch listeners that neutrality was a beautiful thing. This was not for the first time: the same illusionist idealization of neutrality occurs in a newspaper article written in 1938 on the occasion of Queen Wilhelmina's celebrating the fortieth anni- versity of her reign. I myself argued in December 1939, taking issue with the then Minister- President, De Geer, and the Leyden Professor of International Law, Telders, that our neutrality policy might be imposed upon us by circumstances, but that above all things we should not extol it as of positive moral value. "The great ideological contests in history", so I wrote, "have always realized themselves in wars as well. In this war, too, the ideological conflict does undeniably constitute the ultimate issue." I quote this because it has to do directly with my subject. Huizinga was averse to this insistence that we should choose sides, or rather, that we had our appointed place on one side, even at that moment when there was no choice left for Europe than either to make an end of Hitler or to be ruled by Hitler. "Could one at this moment gauge the mood of the various peoples", so he ruminates in the radio talk of 19 November 1939, "the keynote would in every case be that of a profound sadness. Sadness at the downfall of so rich and beautiful a civilization as we have shared in." Huizinga did not usually admire contemporary civilization so whole-heartedly - we know it - but as regards that sadness: was it not rather that in Germany contempt for the noblest traditions of Western civilization was hammered into people's heads, while in England there reigned a determination to save them - for us too? Meanwhile Homo Ludens had thrown a clear light on his mental attitude, although it is almost a contradictio in terminis to speak of a clear light in connection with the changing and gliding tints amid which he moved. A most remarkable book undoubtedly. A book such as can only spring from an unusual mind equipped with a tireless curiosity about the phenomena of life, with an immense erudition, with a vivid imagination. At first one lets oneself be carried along, thinking that the author is in his pricelessly entertaining fashion revealing a great truth, namely that culture, in the sense of giving shape to and ennobling community life, has in the early stages of human history owed a great deal to play, nay, that the coming into existence of</page><page sequence="9">HUFZNGA AS ACCUSER OF HIS AGE 239 culture cannot be imagined without play. in involuntary anticipation the leader expects - that is at least how i reacted - that he will be shown how, when culture gets more highly developed (Huizinga himself makes that distinction between primitive and highly developed states of civilization all the time), the element of play will come to fill a less essential role, and even that the growing predominance of seriousness is the sign par excellence of that higher development. Gradually, however, one becomes aware that this is not how Huizinga sees the problem. He is, on the contrary, out to efface the distinction between play and seriousness. It is as if he were himself carried away by his subject and attached ever greater importance to the play element, Until, finally, towards the end of the book, one comes across what reads like a conclusion: "We have by degrees come to the conviction that culture is rooted i} noble play, and that in order to deploy her highest quality in style and dignity, she cannot do without that admixture of play." Even the intercourse between nations and states should according to our philosopher of civilization be seen as a game. The entire argument seems to have served no other purpose - G. J. Renier made this remark in a review of the book - than to pronounce once more the verdict of guilty over present- day civilization, which has allowed play to deteriorate into puerilism. But has not the whole of the exposition been a play with an unreal and unworldly conception of culture? 7 A play outside what is earnest and crude in life, and intended by the author to screen himself off from these? Plato and Luther are called in to lend their authority to the representation of life itself as a game, a game of God. This does not do much to enlighten us mortals, who cannot unravel God's secret in history; but Huizinga seems to feel the more justified in eliminating from his consideration those unplayful political and economic factors. Even in Violated World, written in 1943/4, we find him in the same mood. Again we are treated to striking samples of that comparison between now and then in which the shortcomings of the ancestors are concealed in order to bring out our own more sharply. Take for instance the degeneration of parliamentarism. "Until some time after 1870", so he says, "the game of popular representation, elections and parliamentary debate was in the countries where it was practised played with a considerable measure of seriousness, good manners, dignity." (The termi- nology the game was played is characteristic.) "Habits like systematic obw struction, clapping desks, or throwing ink-pots were not yet fashionable,,. The representatives of the people belonged in large majority to a certain elite, whether based on wealth, birth, or intellect. They brought good manners along from their homes. They were wont to behave decently and even I The book was dismissed as thoroughly unscientific, based on insufficient and some- times erroneous definitions, by Prof. Buytendijk in De Tijd, 19 Dec. 1938.</page><page sequence="10">240 PIETER GEYL formally. The press worked less quickly than it does today and was less virulent ... It is in a certain sense the admixture of an element of aristocracy which makes democracy possible, for without this it is always in danger of being wrecked on the uncivilized behaviour of the masses." If we were to detail the sins committed by the aristocracy, for all its good manners, long before the period of parliamentarism, or if we displayed the worse than virulent pamphlets of the seventeenth century, the advocates diaboli would find plenty of evidence that Western civilization has always been in a bad way. For symptoms of decay he would not have to wait until "the uncivilized masses" obtained their share of power. How exquisitely unfair can Huizinga be! For pages he describes the "symptoms of degeneration, of decadence and infatuation of political life" which manifested themselves already in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. (This dating of the phenomenon is in flagrant contradiction with the utterance quoted above in which in November 1939 he described the outbreak of war that had just occurred as signifying "the downfall of that rich and beautiful civilization" in which we had still had our share. But there is no end to the contradictions in which he involves himself.) He goes on to point to the Dreyfus affair as an example. A miserable business in- deed, but what has always struck me most in it was the courageous stand made by a small band of intellectuals, and I still regard their victory - in which no doubt less pleasant aspects obtruded themselves only too soon - as an encouraging sign of the vitality of our civilization. But I have not yet mentioned the most astonishing - I ought to say really, the worst - token of Huizinga's blindness in Violated World. Writing in 1943/4 he does not show the slightest awareness of the powers of resistance manifested by Western civilization in the test of war. This racial doctrine, for instance, against which, he had seemed to believe in 1935, the modern lack of critical capacity and the weakening of moral standards were making men defenseless - how splendid an answer had been given by the many (many, if it is remembered that human beings are apt, in any period of civilization, to shrink from danger), the many who had given shelter to persecuted Jews. Also, there were the working men of Amsterdam who in February 1941 went on strike in protest against the anti-Jewish campaign then just opening. This, one should think, ought to have shaken Huizinga in his view - as if the workingmen, "less civilized" or "less educated", were no more than a deadweight on civilization, worse, a danger, now that they are trained by means of "organization" (that modern pest) to "soulless group egoism". But in Violated World Huizinga is still of the opinion that there will be a cultural emergency when the war is over; radio and advertising will have to be limited or abolished, and we shall have to give up much useless lumber, spiritual claptrap and material superfluities. Just as in 1935 (and we shall</page><page sequence="11">HUIZINGA AS ACCUSER OF HIS AGE 241 observe him in similar attitudes at much earlier dates) he rises for a moment in his conclusion - as it were in his own despite - "from the dark mood of seeing not much comfort in the near future of the desolate world that will lie before our eyes tomorrow". If only "the men of good will" scattered over the entire world can come into their own; and it will then be their task "to establish an international order of law among the states" and realize, "on however modest a scale, a fair division of goods and a social reconstruction of society." For a moment then, with his last word, he suggests political and social reforms; only, if one listens to him, they must come about all of a sudden, without contest or fumbling, as a result of a change in the mentality of mankind. II We have gradually seen taking shape - I have at any rate - the illusionist, unworldly attitude of mind that inspired Huizinga to his gloomy speculations. The two methodological errors that I pointed out: the overlooking of the fact that what governed the world crisis was the establishment, under very par- ticular circumstances, of certain political regimes in certain countries; and the idealization of the past for the purpose of having an object of comparison against which the shortcomings of the present (largely imaginary ones) would come out as blackly as possible - these two methodological errors do not so much explain that attitude as that they are produced by it. In order to make this clear we shall have to concern ourselves with Huizinga's earlier life and his earlier works. We shall have the help there of critiques levelled against him in his lifetime; also of impressions published by friends after his death; and of some few studies devoted to him already. There is also his own auto- biographical sketch written in the last year of his life: Mijn weg tot de historic (My Road to History). In these retrospective reflections Huizinga mentions the first impressions that tempted him in the direction of history. They were evoked by a students' pageant in resplendent medieval costumes (he was still a child at the time) and by the collection of old coins he and his elder brother assembled. For a long time he felt no more than velleities. Towards the end of his university study, which was in the field of Dutch language and letters combined with history, he wanted to become a Sanskritist or expert in Indian religion. Gradually however, he felt his heart drawing him away from those distant and alien subjects back to the West, and particularly to the medieval West. The decisive moment - this, too, is characteristic - was his visit to an ex- hibition of old Netherlands art at Bruges in 1902. Life styled in art - that touched him in his inmost being. He approached history visually, with a hankering after beauty, beauty different from what his own time offered him.</page><page sequence="12">242 PIETER GEYL In an article of 1954 8 J. Kamerbeek has strikingly expounded how the literary climate of his younger years had helped to shape Huizinga's mental outlook. De Nieuwe Gids, which at first had seemed to reveal to him life and the world, had almost immediately passed its zenith, but in Tak's Kro- niek, which in the 'nineties had reacted against certain tendencies represented by the famous journal - against the unbridled individualism especially - other of its tendencies were vivaciously continued. As a matter of fact Huizinga had begun by abandoning himself completely to the influence of Van Deyssel, the extreme exponent of the Nieuwe Gids spirit. That "bound- less veneration of art and letters" that "high-literary cult of sentiment", that extolling of "the inner life" above everything, "above the sphere of study or profession" - later in 1942 (in his commemoration of his contemporary and Utrecht'colleague, G. W. Kernkamp) he might smile about it as something "typically undergraduate", but it did fit in with a trait of his being. And especially did he absorb the spirit of opposition to the age, which moved the men of the 'nineties as well as those of the 'eighties. This was in fact an international phenomenon. Everywhere intellectuals, poets and artists sur- rendered to feelings of estrangement from a society that seemed practical and dull, governed by the machine, by the arithmetic and the rationalism of science, by the bourgeois, or by the masses. I mention Nietzsche. Kamerbeek quotes Huysmans saying: "Depuis trois siecles le monde ne fait que dechoir", and adds that the men of the 'nineties practically adopted this view as the leading principle of their philosophy of history. For while the immediate preceding revolutionary period had been inimical to history, now, in the critical examination of tradition, historical awareness woke up again. I add: allied, in the case of some, and probably exactly those with whom Huizinga felt akin, to a nostalgic mood, a neo-romantic dreaming themselves away, into the Middle Ages, or, as did Diepenbrock, the musician, into a past which he saw surviving in the barbaric-hierarchic splendour of the corona- tion festivities at Moscow in 1894. In that same passage in the speech commemorating G. W. Kernkamp, from which I quoted a moment ago, Huizinga said, looking back, that this "ex- treme esthetization of the mind" emanating from De Nieuwe Gids "implied a certain depreciation of scholarship" and that the intellectual life of that young generation (to which he belonged himself) was "well considered, marked by a curious unsolved contradiction". He adds that "this, never- theless, did not in the least hinder an intensive and personal devotion to study and scholarship." I believe it. But it seems none the less certain that this "esthetization", this extolling of the inner life, to a large extent deter- 8 "Huizinga en de beweging van Tachtig", that is to say, the literary movement of the 'eighties centering around De Nieuwe Gids (The New Guide), the monthly journal founded in 1885 by a group of talented young men in opposition to De Gids, by then grown staid and unadventurous. Tijdschrift voor geschiedenis.</page><page sequence="13">HUIZINGA AS ACCUSER OF HIS AGE 243 mined the nature of what in his devoted labor he sought for. Also, was it only his youth that was spent, as he admits, in this "unsolved contradiction"? One of the principal conclusions which my argument about his work will seek to establish is that the contradiction remained unsolved to the very end. In his Groningen inaugural oration, in 1905, at the outset of his career as a historian, he speaks as if he had found the solution. Het aesthetische be- standdeel in geschiedkundige voorstellingen (The Esthetic Component in Historical Exposition), that was the title. The esthetic then, was no more than a component: examination and criticism, scholarly precision, are em- phatically required: "the mining work of critical labour". But at the same time he draws a clear distinction, with grateful acknowledgement of Rickert and Windelband, between historical scholarship and natural science. A picture, an image, should be evoked, laws and generalizations are to be avoided, what matters is the particular; it is men, "who must not be reduced to a bundle of political or economic potentialities", but who are to be ap- proached individually, with psychological imagination. We must remain aware "how vast and beautiful is the world around us". Towards the end of his life the scales seem to have inclined even further towards the particular and the imagination. In his little autobiography, which was then written, he lays a more one-sided emphasis on the intuitive, I shall not say the Un- or anti-, but the extra-scientific, character of his approach to history than he had done in 1905. The conception which was to dominate his most famous work, Herfsttij der middeleeuwen (The Waning of the Middle Ages, 1919), "not the announcement of what was to come, but the dying off of what had had its time", he now describes as having been a "sudden revelation", "6a spark igniting the imagination". This sensitiveness to the fascination of decline in beauty was in itself part of the spiritual at- mosphere in which breathed the Nieuwe Gids-men and their immediate suc- cessors. It is to be found with Kloos, it is to be found with Diepenbrock. In looking back, Huizinga says quite generally: history made an impact on his mind and soul "less as a solid, normal, scientific curiosity, than as an hantise, an obsession, a dream". His work never seemed to him to have "the character of a struggle"; the subjects "never faced him in the way of problems which he had to master." There is no doubt that the sketch Huizinga here presents of his historical labors is heavily charged. The mental attitude that he describes is what distinguishes him most markedly among historians, but it did not govern him completely. He often acted in the other, in what he himself calls the "normal", way. With the intuition, with the seeking contact through the emotion roused by beauty, with the preference for objects of mood or quality not to be comprehended by reason, he did most certainly combine an organ not Qnly for precision but for understanding in a sense different from what he had indicated in his Groningen oration. Years afterwards, in 1929, in a</page><page sequence="14">244 PIETER GEYL theoretical treatise "De taak der cultuurgeschiedenis" ("The Task of Cultural History") and in a brief essay "Een definitie der geschiedenis" ("A Definition of History") - I shall deal with both at greater length later on - he laid all emphasis, more than in 1905 and more especially than in 1943/4, on "ac- counting to oneself": a function in which reason must have the lead, and indeed an essential attribute of the scholarly cast of mind. Much of Huizinga's best and most interesting work owes its existence to that desire for rational "accounting for". Yet it is often a little disturbing to notice that the two inclinations of the personality such as I have delineated them did not harmonize too well. Even when the rationalistic, the critical side, the side intrigued by the problem, takes charge, Huizinga remains, to use a phrase of Kamerbeek's "an irrationalist mal repenti". In some of the writings, no doubt, the conversion appears to be complete and flawless. To mention one instance: in the masterly essay "Het probleem der Renaissance" of 1920. Huizinga himself was of the opinion, in the retrospective sketch of his life, that The Waning of Middle Ages was likely "always to be considered as the top of [his] production." And this is exactly the work in which this distinctive quality of the imagination commandingly and magically manifests itself. It appeared in 1919, but the conception, about which we heard him a moment ago, dated according to his recollection as far back as 1907. It thus became a vision deepened and enriched by many years of study during which he came to be on intimate terms with the phenomena that had fascinated him from the start through the subdued passion of his preference: the phenomena of the different ways of life of those generations, the phenomena of their psy- chology, of the unfamiliar forms in which these expressed themselves in the social as in the political sphere, all of it seen throughout in the tints of decline. But in this definition of what drew his interest, in which the social and the political factors never seem to have a significance of their own, at best serving as a framework, a limitation is indicated which struck his fellow historians at once. It was particularly S. Muller Fzn who, with all admiration, gave voice to professional criticism. When at the end of his long article in Onze Eeuw (1920) he advised Huizinga to write a little "more simply", "as befits a calm historian", warning him "that literary laurels always have a suspicious colour for a writer of history", the philistinism is hard to bear. But the reservations he indicates from his historian's point of view are not therefore less well- founded. He points to the uncertainty with which the author had treated the problem, mostly evading it in fact, of the relationship between the French- Burgundian culture of the court and the burgher civilization especially in the Dutch-speaking Netherlands. He criticizes the systematic neglect of economic and political factors. The violent party feuds of the Hoeks and Kabeijauws, by which especially the Northern Netherlands were torn in the fifteenth</page><page sequence="15">HUIZINGA AS ACCUSER OF HIS AGE 245 century, Huizinga tries to explain psychologically, as springing naturally from the quarrelsome temperament of that vehement medieval generation: he shrugs away the politico-economic conflict which was so obviously at the back of these troubles. He does not even seem to be interested in the great event of the establishment of the Burgundian state (or dynastic power), with the result that the Burgundian dukes, whom he pictures so vividly in their personal behaviour and peculiarities, do not in the end get their due.9 How we do recognize here the Huizinga we saw emerge from his treat- ment of the crisis governing his own day in the 'thirties! The man who wanted us to look upon culture in isolation, as an exclusively spiritual process, flourishing or declining according to its own rhythm. The man who never faced the question as to which political and economic factors had raised National Socialism to power, nor exactly where. But in the same period of the long incubation of The Waning of the Middle Ages such profoundly differing work appeared over Huizinga's name as Geschiedenis der Universiteit (History of the University of Groningen, 1814-1914) in 1914, and Mensch en Menigte in Amerika (Man and the Crowd in America) in 1918. These publications afford indeed striking evi- dence of the variety of his powers as a writer of history and of the vastness of the field of his interest. The university history especially satisfied all that might be asked in the way of rational and scholarly method. And that sub- ject, far from promising as it might seem at first sight, he managed to trans- form into a little masterpiece of cultural history. Simply by means of patient and loving attention, by means of a disinterested desire to understand these men - quite little men, often enough - within the framework of their time, that is, in the wider framework of European intellectual life - and the author here gives evidence of unusual erudition - but local circumstances too, po- litical and economic, are taken into account when necessary. The style, moreover, is as "simple" as Muller could wish, which does not prevent it from sparkling with life and wit. But then Man and the Crowd in America! Side by side with the late Middle Ages in their romantic splendor and violent emotions, colored by 9 Prof. Hugenholtz writes in his Ridderkrijg en burgervrede, 1959, that "modernity", "something new", was increasing in importance from the twelfth century on and was visible everywhere in the fifteenth. "Only, the group Huizinga had taken for his subject did not see it ... What manifested itself as modernity was not to be found at the courts; the phenomena were in the first instance economic, bureaucratic, bourgeois. And since H. did not deal with, and never meant to deal with, those aspects of life-and one cannot blame him for this, and those who did blame him were grievously wrong-, this modernity is hardly at all to be found in his book." The way in which the problem is posed here does not quite satisfy me. One certainly cannot "blame" Huizinga for having wanted to deal with the court and knightly culture particularly. But that he neglected expressly to set out this limitation, that he did not draw the reader's attention to the contrast indicated by Hugenholtz (I am not suggesting that he should have given it elaborate treatment), does detract from the value as history of his magnificent book.</page><page sequence="16">246 PIETER GEYL the sunset of a civilization that has come to seem to us so strange, and with the quiet, often somewhat provincial and self-satisfied sphere of academic Groningen during the last hundred years slowly changing over from eigh- teenth-century enlightenment to modern realism, he dared to cope with that youthful, seething society of America and its sharply differing forms and problems. What drove him to that study - and here the Huizinga of the 'thirties announces himself after all - was undoubtedly that he was already beginning to watch the development of Western civilization with misgivings, and in America he discerned some of its, to his thinking, most ominous tendencies in alarming force. The book has not for all that grown to be an indictment, as seventeen years later In the Shadows of Tomorrow was to be. It gives a richly varied picture, in which bright and hopeful phenomena have their place. Yet what will remain most vivid in the reader's mind is the specter of "the mechanization of communal life" (so runs the title of one of the four chapters): man become the slave of the machine and of the organization. In one striking passage Huizinga admits that mechanization contains in itself a civilizing factor. Man must - "indispensable condition for becoming aware of his human value" - order the forces of society and of nature. But every improvement or refinement of the instrument "binds him anew to the blind power". And, one is inclined to ask, does the dialectical process then come to a stop? It seems clear at times that this in indeed what Huizinga means. "How", he says, "'will the life of the spirit in this highly developed modem society escape the deterioration, the levelling and mechan- izing, which are bound indissolubly to the commercializing of society?' As if the spirit did not dispose of independent power to react! As if culture did not, among other things, mean resistance against what threatens the spirit! It should be remembered that Huizinga studied America at a somewhat unfortunate moment in the country's development 10; and when a few years later he was able to see it with his own eyes, it was perhaps even worse off. In the notes he made of that experience, the despondent tone sounds more insistently. Since then, however, has not that reaction in which he found it so difficult to believe manifested itself overwhelmingly? Meanwhile, Man and the Crowd, for all that the author's idiosyncrasy misdrew in it, is a wonderfully able achievement. The knowledge and the acumen, the subtlety of the observation and the bold vision with which con- nections are suggested between various aspects of American life - these can- not be observed without the most vivid admiration. But how puzzling seems that pessimism, coming from this despiser of the material, from this devoted servant of the spirit. I said already that this pessimism had not only America for its object. 10 It should also be noted that the historians Turner and Beard, to whom H. liked to listen, at that time could still pass for authoritative. Their views have since been seriously devalued.</page><page sequence="17">HUIZINGA AS ACCUSER OF HIS AGE 247 Huizinga brought it with him from the contemplation of his own country, of his own Europe. "In the century in which we live", so he wrote, "mankind seems to become the helpless slave of its own perfect means of material and social technique." In the ensuing years his mood did not lighten. In 1921 Spengler's Untergang des Abendlandes made its appearance, and in the entire Western world, shocked by the first world war, disillusioned by Versailles, helplessly stumbling in economic distress, that book made an enormous im- pression. It did so on Huizinga. "Everyone who sees the mechanization of the life of the spirit and of the community as the phenomenon spelling ruin to our present world", so he wrote, "will find much to enlighten him". But he also finds much in it to revolt him. The system, upon which as upon the bed of Procrustes Spengler fits his historical presentations, was unacceptable to the historian in Huizinga. "Whoever still feels the need to know about the things of the past what we can truly know of them, whoever loves things in their own singularity even when it is inexplicable and irreducible, will not surrender to the magician." Moreover Huizinga's humanity was repelled by Spengler, by the man's philosophy of power, by his Germanic racialism. And so he concludes his article by stating that "Spengler's book has in a homoeo- pathical way had a curative effect on me, freeing me in some little measure from my own dark despair about the future of our civilization: his hopeless certainty made me feel that I still had hope and did not know." It still sounds passably dejected. And his near-despair made him turn to and cling to, most unexpectedly, the comfort that Wells's Outline of History might furnish. He reviewed that book in the same article, "Twee worstelaars met de Engel" ("Two Strugglers with the Angel"). He could not but find Wells's system as unacceptable as Spengler's. Wells, the illusionistic hu- manist and rationalist, had but "little sense" of "art, cult, and rite" and so belonged to a species of men for which Huizinga really had little use. But after all the criticism to which he subjected the book, Wells charmed him by "his great mildness, his boundless confidence, his firm hope". To me the long passage which he quotes in support, Wells's fervent announcement of a new world after the deplorable failure of the old, sounds equally un- historical with the rest. But in fact the whole of that famous piece of Huizinga's - and indeed it is written with irresistible fervour and vividness - proves only that he found himself in a labile state of mind. We see him seek a way out of "despair". For one moment, in that same year, he imagines he has found a guide in Seilliere, the French philosopher. Seilliere looked for the cause of the malady of culture in the undue strain put upon two of the three life forces that he distinguished and for which he had his own names: imperialism, the desire of each human being and of each group for self-realization; mysticism, the sense of living and working by the grace of a higher, a supra-rational, supra-human principle. The third force, which ought to keep the others in control, is reason, a term which</page><page sequence="18">248 PIETER GEYL Seilliere does not interpret rationalistically, but by which he means the capacity of observing limitations with the aid of the experience and wis- dom of our ancestors. The weakening of the last-named force, and the over-straining of the first two, coming to light in the forms of nationalism, socialism, and estheticism; all have, according to Seilliere, their origin in romanticism. He gave expression to a wide-spread mood: it is well to recall tile fact, because it helps to place Huizinga. In France there was not only Maurras, the preacher of what he himself called "classicism", although in his hands it degenerated into a nationalism that could not be more "over-strained". But there was also his disciple, who soon parted ways with him, Pierre Lasserre, whose Le romantisme franQais (1907) for all its exaggerations amounts to an impressive indictment. In America there appeared in 1919 Irving Bab- bitt's Rousseau and Romanticism, animated by a closely related spirit. For Seilliere also, Rousseau was the fatal figure par excellence. He opposes to the fashionable aberration an attitude of stoicism and preaches self-control on the basis of a rational traditionalism. He closes on a note of pragmatic optimism - indispensable if one is to persist in striving after improvement. Huizinga, in the article he devoted to him, follows his exposition on the whole with agreement; he even sees in the philosopher's emergence a proof that the role of the French people as guide and pioneer is not yet played out. But the conclusion leaves him doubtful. "May we hope it? Is not man's thinking power too badly paralyzed under the double influence of the supremacy of sentiment on one side and of the mechanization of culture on the other? ... Society overwhelms us with impressions, cheap and mass-produced. The influence of strong and pure minds has lost in effectiveness because blind and mechanical organizations feed the masses gratis with surrogates and poison. The spirit has been plebeianized and our poor brain can no longer cope with the world." (I remark in passing that he would not, could not, surpass this in the 'thirties; the word gratis is revealing!) "The only way out seems to be through a strong resorption of culture: limitation, simplification, our entire world of notions more severely shaped. Has Western humanity sufficient control over its mind to see to, in the way Seilliere proposes, the purification of its civi- lization itself? Or will it have to be done by a succession of catastrophes? . . It is the program of 1935 in optima forma. But Huizinga still has some- thing to add: "At all events, let us strive. This is the lesson taught us by Seilliere's earnest works." However, how does one strive for the realization of such ai completely unreal program? One can go on uttering laments and admonitions, but if one takes one's stand on these negative principles, so detached from the time, it is impossible to interfere to any purpose in devel- opments. Huizinga did not, during the remainder of his life, mention Seilliere more</page><page sequence="19">HUIZINGA AS ACCUSER OF HIS AGE 249 than once or twice in passing. Yet I believe that the Frenchman had made a permanent impression on his thinking. More sharply than before he seems from now on aware of the dangers of romanticism. With respect to nation- alism and socialism he was sufficiently on his guard already, but in over- strained estheticism too he now saw an enemy. Applying to history the powers of reason, with aristocratic and stoic restraint, that, he feels, is the way for him to strive.and combat the diseases of culture. m These were the ideas he elaborated in some treatises on the theory of history collected in a volume under the title of Cultuiurhistorische verkenningen (Explorations in Cultural History) in 1929. These essays are not among his best work, for all the subtle and arresting remarks one comes across in them. But in connection with my subject they are of importance - also on account of the sharp attacks they elicited from three younger men. Huizinga begins by defining the history of civilization as an attempt to distinguish forms of life which take shape under the hands of researchers and thinkers. The concept of development, borrowed from biology, he rejects. Elsewhere, but not unconnected with this, he ranges anthropomorphism, the staging of historical abstractions under the guise of human beings, among the greatest dangers that threaten true historical understanding. Meanwhile he has entered upon a long digression about another danger, namely that "history for a larger public might fall into the hands of an estheticism-cum-sentimentalism proceeding from literary aspirations, work- ing with literary methods and directed towards literary effects." This is the introduction to an - I should almost say, tempestuous - outburst against the genre of the vie romance, which had then suddenly come into fashion. A concession, so he thinks, to the feeble romanticism of our levelled-down society, to the plebeian love for sentimentality and passionism, to the dimin- ished capacity for concentration of the reader, enslaved to time-wasting diversions - a disloyal competition with the professional historians. At the same time he recognizes as an element, and "a very important one", of the process of "becoming aware historically" the emotion, related to art or religion, which he dubs "the sensation" - a term which Van Deyssel had introduced for his own purposes and which it is indeed curious to see cropping up here; the more so since the argument as a whole means a definite break with Van Deyssel's influence. For, note well: "The form in which modern civilization can know the past is that of critical scholarship." True history must be stoic, must not indulge in pity with all the world's sorrows, must observe a certain sceptical reserve. When Huizinga next comes to giving practical advice, there are also some</page><page sequence="20">250 PIETER GEYL points that arrest our attention: "For the time being the history of civilization finds enough to do in determining the particular forms of historic life. Her task it is to draw up a special morphology before she should venture upon the general." For periodization she had better use a colorless, merely chron- ological terminology, instead of, for instance, the Renaissance, the period of the Baroque, and the like. "There is plenty of time before we should come to describe entire civilizations round one central notion. Let us for the time being be above all pluralistic." In another treatise, a paper read before the Amsterdam Academy in this same year 1929, Huizinga tried to define his conception of history. Every civilization, so he said, produces its own form of history and must do so. It is work demanding "inexorable seriousness", for, as he had already asserted in the other piece, the element of play, so prominent in literature, is lacking in toto in history-writing. A statement that surprises coming from the future author of Homo Ludens. And this is how he formulated his "concise de- finition": "History is the spiritual form in which a civilization accounts for herpast." One advantage of this definition that he stresses is: "It provides a way out of the dilemma of either the more intellectual or the more visual character of our historical knowledge." It is the dilemma that I observed already never ceased worrying Huizinga, and while he asserts that he here leaves it intact, I feel rather that with the term "accounting to oneself", and indeed with the distribution of his accents in the whole of the preceding argumentation, he comes down unmistakably on the side of the "intellectual". The factor of "the sensation", which as we saw he did not pass by in silence, to which on the contrary he still seemed to attach great importance, does not find a place in his definition. He now speaks of "a way out". I should not want him to have made a choice, but a connection was indeed required. Evidently he had not yet solved the prob- lem, as can indeed be seen throughout. Now this was the central point against which the three to whom I alluded already directed their criticism, Ter Braak, Van Eyck, Romein - no con- temptible adversaries." Ter Braak, to take him first, in an essay "Huizinga vo6r de afgrond" ("H. I Mennno ter Braak, 1902-1940 (committed suicide on the day of the capitulation), critic, took a leading part in the definitive reaction against Nieulve Gids estheticism. (Verzanzeld Werk published after the war.) His friend and ally Du Perron, 1899-1940, an even more impetuous fighter than he, and author of at least one outstanding novel, died of a heart attack on the same tragic day. My essay on the two, mentioned below, is reprinted in my volume Reacties (1952).-P. N. van Eyck, 1887-1954, poet and critic, succeeded Verwey as Leyden Professor of Dutch Literature in 1935.-Jan Romein, 1893-1962, Professor of History at the University of Amsterdam 1939-1962. About him see a little essay in my volume Encounters in History, Meridian, N.Y., 1961.</page><page sequence="21">HUIZINGA AS ACCUSER OF HIS AGE 251 Before the Abyss"), mocks at the older man's caution, his desire to ensure his safety. This "pluralism" for instance, and then "for the time being": for the time being no philosophy of life! He discerns in his exposition a return to the old, the antiquated, objectivist historiography against which the de- spised literary genre, the vie romancee, meant a welcome reaction. I am still of the opinion which I expressed in an essay devoted to Ter Braak and Du Perron in 1951, not only that Ter Braak valued the signifi- cance of that genre too positively, but that he followed all too easy a line in arguing as if, now that we are agreed on recognizing a subjective element in all history-writing, the brakes may be loosened altogether and we can be subjective to our heart's content: all that we can provide is after all no more than myths... And yet I am struck now to observe how often Ter Braak hits the mark in indicating Huizinga's hesitations, evasions, contradictions. Even before I re-read his essay, I had come to be more keenly aware of these than I was when writing in 1951. Huizinga's angry rejection of the "disloyal competi- tion" of literary history-writing seems to me now to be undeniably lacking in measure. Ter Braak suggests - and I must say that I think there is something to be said for the suggestion - that his anger is that of the man who shrinks from his own inclination in that direction and who moreover too often lost his balance under the influence of the fear and hostility with which he regarded his time. If Ter Braak did not go beyond making light-hearted play (so at least it seemed on the surface) with Huizinga's confusions and uncertainties, Van Eyck went all out for him in grim earnest and with murderous sarcasm. His article makes heavy reading (as is usual with him), but if one manages to work through the awkward constructions and the long sentences, it turns out to be an important contribution. Naturally, for him too the first butt is the assigning of a lower place to the imagination and the extolling of critical scholarship, though better than Ter Braak he makes it clear that he does not want to deny the latter its due. We saw that Huizinga in the 1929 volume represents history as free from all element of play, while literature is permeated with it. But much worse was an utterance in another essay, which Van Eyck quotes: "A literature must never take itself wholly seriously. For when it imagines itself to be mounting the heights of supreme Wisdom and leaves the bounds of the playground, it will forsake its glory." Bitter was the indignation of the serious-minded poet. The sallies against the vies romancees he could (unlike Ter Braak) dismiss with a shrug: what is at issue here is mostly "bad history and bad literature". But Huizinga had asserted that even "literature in general" is inclined today to magnify the element of passion and that the critics will not on any account have the standards of morality praised. And now Van Eyck retorts, briefly and cuttingly: "The judgment of a layman, even where the Nieuwe Gids period is concerned." And on the</page><page sequence="22">252 PIETER GEYL passage quoted first: "He forgets the royal works of the creative spirit" -- a pronouncement with which he also meant to efface the sharp line of cleavage drawn by Huizinga between literature and historiography. In his reply to the three critics - not until 1935 - Huizinga admits that Van Eyck had "drawn his attention to a lapses memoriae". When he, Huizinga, in distinguishing between history and literature, had asserted that the first-named "is entirely lacking in the element of play, [he] was for a moment forgetting [his] own view, expressed since", and so he now corrects: "is almost entirely lacking in." Expressed since refers to his rectoral oration of 1933, which was a kind of rehearsal, in brief, of the ideas to be published in maturer form in Homo Ludens a few years later. The problem at issue here is only adumbrated in that oration and what strikes me most in it is the account, towards the end, of a conversation with a colleague on the scientific side. When this man said: "I believe that for you even science and scholarship are a noble game", "I was startled", confesses Huizinga, "I answered with a half-hearted yes, but within me I heard the cry of no!" On second thought, in the oration, he saves himself from his embarrassment by quoting that word of Luther's, of which I observed before that it does not really make us any wiser. His own view, he said to Van Eyck. Did he have anything so positive? He rather seems to be groping around in un- certainty. Another point is that of anthropomorphism. We know how decisively Huizinga rejected that device. But, observes Van Eyck, in the very definition he submitted to the Academy he sins against his own precept. Does he not describe history as "a spiritual form in which a culture accounts to itself for its past"? Does he not add: "We cannot abandon the demand of scholarship without forsaking the conscience of our culture." Comments Van Eyck: "One can only forsake one's own conscience. Not our culture, but our historians have a conscience that can be forsaken." And he argues that in Huizinga's phrasing there is implied the demand that the modem historian should subordinate his labors to his conception of modem culture. And he adds: "The fact is that Huizinga assumes the existence of one contemporary culture and not only considers it possible to know and define the nature of that culture, but is positively convinced that he has discovered that defini- tion, so that he can summon all present-day cultural phenomena before his, or our civilization's, judgment seat." A question of fundamental importance arises here, and I shall now on my own account expressly pose it. Huizinga is inclined - even though he speaks quite differently on many occasions - to present contemporary culture or the culture of an earlier age as a unit by itself, an inclination of which the anthropomorphic way of ex- pression is unconscious evidence. Listen to the following. Huizinga regards the sham history which is so successful nowadays as a danger, because</page><page sequence="23">HUIZINGA AS ACCUSER OF HIS AGE 253 historical science must not be borne by a band of esoteric scholars alone: "It must rest on the foundation of a historic culture, which is the property of all civilized men." My first query here would be: "Only of all civilized men?" Van Eyck asks (and this too is an obvious query): "Of all civilized men? Can there not be two varieties of culture simultaneously?" It is true that Huizinga himself in another passage accepts the possibility of differen- tiation: "according to different nations", and within each of those again "according to groups, classes, parties"; whereupon, so he thinks, "there follows automatically the corresponding differentiation in the form of history- writing." But in this way the concept of culture assumes an even more tyrannical character. The unending variety, the contest between numerous views, of which our culture is the resultant shaped in our comprehension - Van Eyck's mentioning "two varieties" is far from doing justice to reality as I see it- are obscured and the historian's personal liberty of judgment gets impeded. But into what a confusion does Huizinga land himself - Van Eyck points it out mercilessly - when he attempts to determine the task of historical scholarship within contemporary civilization! First, he lays it down that historical scholarship shall be stoic. Then, that our civilization, of which he also had said that it tolerates no other form of knowledge with respect to the past than that of critical scholarship, "shall be democratic, or it shall not be". Next, that "the people is always anti-stoic". Finally, "history may become democratic, it must remain stoic." And he adds: "It is questionable whether the construction of present-day cultural life leaves any room for a historical science which as donor of culture will dominate over the literary apperception of the past." Indeed, there remains little else than such a dejected and doubting con- clusion once one has got stuck in such incompatible convictions so positively expressed. Huizinga, it is true, says bravely that "historical science must venture to enter into competition with all that talent, fashion, and intellectual sloth throw into the scale of literature." Van Eyck is not impressed. He characterizes Huizinga's attitude with the word passivity. And how could Huizinga "venture" when he has weakened his position by mistaking a possible ally - true literature - as an enemy! "Impotent dreaming, which will not turn the tide, that is all he does, instead of co-operating, with clear perception, in throwing up a dyke." Thus Van Eyck. Romein wrote after Ter Braak and Van Eyck. He also speaks of confusions and contradictions, of rashness and retreat, a retreat "into a clair-obscur, leaving behind all sharp-lined, exact opinions". Romein employs for a large part the same arguments as the two other critics had done, sometimes strengthening them; but at the same time he introduces a new point of view. It is, naturally, the point of view of historical materialism. Bartstra, in</page><page sequence="24">254 PIETER GEYL an article of 1938, reviewed more especially the relations between Huizinga and Romein. He contrasts very tellingly: the indeterminism of the one, aiming at nothing but the enrichment-through-observation of the history- writer's personality, conquering the eternal uncertainty and the doubts accompanying his contact with the past through ethical speculations, which remind Bartstra of nothing so much as of the well-meaning sermons of modernist Protestant preachers; and the determinism of the other, who possesses a perfect certainty and sees in history the means for serving the realization of the final purpose known to him; "dangerous one-sidedness", as Bartstra puts it, who remarks also that this attitude of mind little fitted Romein for approaching Huizinga's characteristic qualities with patience and comprehension.12 My attitude towards the Romein-Huizinga "dispute" is not fundamentally different from Bartstra's, but, since I am now dealing especially with Hui- zinga and his indictment of his age, I shall confine myself largely to what I have found to be illuminating in Romein's criticism. Not that I shall not repeatedly have to make reservations on particular points. When for instance Romein misses in Huizinga's definition of history the relevance to the present which is indispensable for all history-writing (he naturally quotes Croce in this connection), then, although I am far from underestimating the significance of history for our own life, I cannot help querying the word all. When he is pleased with Huizinga's recognition of the inevitability of subjectivity and especially with his connecting particular subjectivities with groups (sectional cultures), I on the contrary, as I ex- plained above, not only feel that Huizinga's argument in this passage in- volves questionable consequences, but must especially shake my head, or smile, when Romein among those group-subjectivities awards a decided preference to the socialist, "or more exactly, Marxist", brand; indeed, he goes further and asserts that the inevitable subjectivity can best be overcome, even though always only partially, with the aid of the historical-materialist method, which directs the attention especially on "the zones where deter- 12 "Indeterminism" undoubtedly fits in with the whole of H.'s vision upon history. Nevertheless, in 1924, in an address to American students at Leyden, discussing one of my earliest expositions of the view that the sixteenth-century split of the Netherlands had been caused, not by innate differences between the populations, but by the fortuitous events of foreign intervention and military operations, he had spoken as follows: "I for myself am inclined to side with those who regard historical development with the eyes of determinism, rather searching the past to find why things have come about as they did than to prove-what theoretically always can be proved-that they might have fallen out otherwise too." I took position at once against this statement of principle in an article in De Gids, 1926; reprinted 1930, 1946, 1960. In 1938, in a review of his Science of History, I recalled his statement and placed over against it what he wrote now: "The historian must stick to an indeterministic point of view with regard to his subject . . . Only by retaining an open mind for the boundlessness of possibilities can he do justice to the fulness of life." Personally, of course, I found, and find, this latter statement wholly satisfying.</page><page sequence="25">HUIZINGA AS ACCUSER OF HIS AGE 255 mination applies". When Romein, continuing, describes Huizinga's opting for "colorless names for periods" as "a mere smoke-screen" to hide the colorlessness of his own theoretical position, I can no more willingly follow him. No doubt the description of an Idealtypus of culture (Max Weber's term, with which Romein here operates) can yield splendid results, we need remember only Burckhardt's Kultur der Renaissance in Italien and Huizinga's own Waning of the Middle Ages. But to lament "the pulverization of the image", as Romein was to do some ten years later in his inaugural oration, has always seemed to me senseless. Romein reproaches Huizinga for having in his article (of 1920) "The Problem of the Renaissance" merely demolished Burckhardt's vision without, not even later, erecting an image of his own devising in its place. "The counterpart of The Autumn of the Middle Ages [this is the literal translation of the title known in English as The Wanino of the Middle Ages], The Spring of the Modern Age, has remained stuck ill 'The Problem'." Let me say only that in my opinion that article "The prob- lem of the Renaissance"' is a splendid piece of work, which gives profound intellectual satisfaction, "the liberating word" as Enno van Gelder has said of it, a triumph of critical scholarship. It shows with what mastery Huizinga, if he was so minded, could practise the craft, which, truly, we must not for- sake, neither for the literary or Nietzschean certainty of Ter Braak nor for the historical-materialist certainty of Romein.13 But I can go along with Romein in the criticism he levels at Huizinga's precept to confine the task of cultural history to "specific morphology" - "for the time being" at that, an additional clause with which (to make in passing a remark of my own) he seems to be adducing that ostensibly humble pretext of Vorarbeit, which in an earlier paragraph he had denounced. He now suggests a number of subjects: the Garden, the Road, the Market and the Inn; the Horse, the Hound and the Falcon; the Hat and the Book - all these in their cultural functions. There is here plainly something of that abdication which Ter Braak and Van Eyck too had noticed. When, however, Romein attempts to explain this passage by Huizinga's mental attitude, we notice an accent differing from that laid by the two literary men. By proposing these "harmless subjects", he says, Huizinga 13 H. Schulte Nordholt in his doctoral thesis promoterr Prof. Romein) Het beeld aer Renaissance (1948) devotes a note of over three pages to H.'s article. He deplores the "pulverization" (Romein's term), but the weakness of his position comes out when he writes: "If a writer does not believe in the possibility of a rebirth, that is to say, of a change involving the complex in its totality, happening per saltum and being final, then he will see every image falling to pieces in his wavering hands. And he will not only fail to see God's Kingdom, but not a single kingdom will he see, not that of the Renaissance either. Iridescent fragments, glittering splinters, that is all that will remain." The "image" of the Renaissance is here postulated by a faith. H.'s criticism levelled against it must be rejected, because otherwise that faith-the faith in sudden and final turns in history-might be affected. But why should we allow that faith to be forced upon us?</page><page sequence="26">256 PIETER GEYL degrades history to the level of a game - he who had just declared so proudly that it, in contradistinction to literature, is lacking in the element of play, that it must be "inexorably serious". A game? Instead of a struggle. For, says Romein, "great historiography is a fighting weapon; or at least a fighting testimony." Huizinga "has succumbed to his Erasmian need of a safe neu- trality." His subjects are "deliberately turned away from the aspirations of our time and confined to the quiet of his study, where the plebeian tumult of the street doet not penetrate, and the anti-stoic struggle for a crust of bread is not perceived." And Romein quotes Huizinga's dictum "that history must not indulge in pity for all the world's sorrows." Pity? asks Romein; apparently it does not occur to Huizinga that history might engage in a struggle. Let me here insert the remark that, while fully admitting the justification of the factor of struggle in history-writing, I should not, as Romein does, make it a condition of great history. His introduction into the debate of the social motive, however, I think is completely warranted. I only wonder whether it is sufficient to speak of Huizinga's "need of a safe neutrality". We heard him call upon the historian, in 1905, to remain aware "how vast and beautiful is the world around us." A few years after Explorations in Cultural History he wrote, in his Wetenschap der geschiedenis (Science of History, 1934/5), that "to let oneself be engrossed in history is a form of enjoyment of the world"; he wants to "lose himself in the contemplation" of the past. Even though, deeply shocked by the spectacle offered by "the world around" him, he had as early as 1921 abjured estheticism; even though, calling in the aid of all forces of rational control, stoicism had since become his fa- vorite word; in his heart he still wanted that history should reveal to him, truth no doubt, but also beauty. His reactions were those of the disappointed esthete. True, it seems undeniable that the esthetic satisfaction, and no less the esthetic repulsion, were largely socially determined. Even in order to explain the confusions in Huizinga's philippic against the estheticizing sentiment- alism of a certain kind of literary historiography, Romein emphasizes the social aspect. According to him Huizinga came to find himself in the wrong camp "out of dread of democracy". Huizinga could not recognize in "the people" any potency for culture; he quotes the conclusion of Rostovtzeff's Social and Economic History of the Roman Empire: "Is it possible to extend a higher civilization to the lower classes without debasing its standard and diluting its quality to the vanishing point? Is not every civilization bound to decay as soon as it begins to penetrate the masses?" 14 A question that may 14 Romein reproaches H. for having ignored another statement made by Rostovtzeff immediately before: "Our civilization will not last unless it be a civilization, not of one class, but of the masses." This does indeed throw a different light on the passage quoted by H., who did not, however, take up this point in his reply of 1935.</page><page sequence="27">HUIZINGA AS ACCUSER OF HIS AGE 257 well oppress us, according to Huizinga, and indeed it reverberated gloomily within him. "Our culture", says Romein, "about which Huizinga is talking all the time, naturally is in course of disappearing, but the thought can oppress only a man who does not or does not want to perceive the new culture behind it (which is the old one at the same time)." Again I can go in the direction here pointed by Romein, although I do not like this terminology of "the old" and "the new" culture: I find too much in it of Huizinga's own, so to speak, absolutizing conception of culture, even though Romein by that somewhat confusing clause about it being "the old one at the same time" tries to meet the objection. I should rather say that the composite of forces and tendencies which in our observation or our conception or our imagination appears as an entity that we call culture, is from its very nature subject to constant alteration. The component factors change places in their mutual relationship, each grows either stronger or weaker, or varies its direction. We need not for that reason doubt the continuity of the process, and the awareness of this which history can teach us is in itself a quality of culture and an invigorating one. But Huizinga felt oppressed by the changes he noticed, part of a natural development though they were. His heart was wedded to a state of affairs which he, wrongly, identified with "our" culture; a state of affairs that he wanted to see stabi- lized, but that was in fact "in process of disappearing" - which did not at all mean that culture was disappearing. Above all he detested the larger share taken by the masses and all the phenomena inevitably accompanying that development. Here then we have, in my opinion as well as in Romein's, a decisive point for the explanation of Huizinga's mentality. This interpretation is confirmed by numerous utterances, not in the later writings only, which I have already quoted. Ter Braak and Van Eyck certainly gave evidence, in their reactions to Explorations in Cultural History, of having noticed this factor, but they laid the emphasis elsewhere nevertheless. They saw the celebrated author of The Waning of the Middle Ages shrink back from his own success. It was the men of letters who had applauded him, the professional historians had maintained reserve. With them now, with critics of the kind of S. Muller Fzn, he wanted to rehabilitate himself. In his reply of a few years later, in which he passed by many of the objec- tions advanced, Huizinga scouted this interpretation decisively. "I have never bothered about suspicions of unscholarliness. I work and write as it is given me." This is a protestation in which I believe unconditionally. His work, his convictions, his outlook upon life, were too closely tied up with his deepest nature for him to have wanted to adapt them to the pleasure of his critics, or of his professional colleagues however highly esteemed. The unmistakable change, and the contradictions, must have welled up from a much deeper source.</page><page sequence="28">258 PIETER GEYL The stoical and rational, anti-romantic doctrine of Seilliere, whence he sought support from 1921 on, agreed with part of Huizinga's being, but there were, and there remained, other needs urging his soul. Romein, as we saw, in speaking of Huizinga's need for safety, slipped in the qualification "Erasmian". I see another problem here. Not long after Huizinga's death, in 1946, Romein wrote that in his book on Erasmus (1934), Huizinga had in fact painted himself: "wavering between the op- posing sides, the non-fighter."'15 But with how little sympathy did Huizinga approach Erasmus, and on this very ground! He actually reproaches him, as did Direr, for not having chosen for Luther. It is not because wavering between the parties or keeping apart from the struggle appeal to me that I have never found this particular book of Huizinga's satisfactory. I see Erasmus in quite a different light, and he seems to me to have been mis- judged by both Huizinga and Romein. Erasmus's true greatness lies, not in that he wavered, but in that he consistently refused to take sides with either of the two absolutisms which were then threatening Western civilization. But Luther's absolutism, Luther's, who in Erasmus saw Reason incarnated and on that score hated him so passionately'6 was able to charm Huizinga. Luther, as he says in another connection, "whose word has at times the sound of eternity."'17 Erasmus, on the other hand, left him cool. Between reason and mysticism, too, there was in Huizinga's make-up an unsolved conflict. I myself wrote in 1946 that in his personality and mind we seem to discern "a floating, a conscious weighing and probing of subtle distinctions, a trying to make extremes go together, which did occasionally rouse his critics to impatience. Understandable - although what we have here before us is Huizinga's deepest being, which constitutes his irreplaceable value." Yes, this judgment I can maintain. That "conducting a conversation with himself" (as I put it in the same article), that unending, unsolved struggle with himself, those inclinations in incompatible directions, make him inter- esting. "Subtle versatility rather than closed systematism" - to quote once more my own words of sixteen years ago - "the advantage is unmistakable. In fact it placed him in an attitude towards life and towards history which can surprise ever anew. One may differ, one may observe that he differed from himself. But one feels all the time in contact with a human being, with a mind, and one feels enriched even in opposition." All this I can still say with conviction, and yet, after my renewed and more thorough study of the work, I feel that the contradictions of the state of mind may suggest less extenuating terms. In Explorations in Cultural History we see not without concern the signs of an irresolution, an inner 15 "Huizinga als historicus" (1946), in Tussen Vrees en Vrijheid, 1950. 16 Lucien Febvre, Un destin; Martin Luther (Paris, 1927), 257-8. 17 Towards the close of his rectoral oration, 1935.</page><page sequence="29">HUIZINGA AS ACCUSER OF HIS AGE 259 confusion, which betray a profound dichotomy. The connection of this with the systematic hostility towards the development he saw the world going through is evident. By giving such prominence in his analysis to the social motive, Romein has undoubtedly made a contribution. It is there that I too find the decisive factor: in the irritation, in the uneasiness bordering on panic, with which he observed the progressive democratization or, as he put it, plebeianization, of society. It was this feeling that threw him out of his balance in his intellectual life as well, so that he was apt to warp relations and to mistake proportions." IV "True historical interest presupposes a certain detachment from the present." So Huizinga wrote in 1926, in the preface to his volume Ten Studies. It is a debatable thesis. But the curious thing is that Huizinga did not at all conform to his own precept. I have shown all through that he was on the contrary closely tied to his present- through opposition, through disapproval, through constantly saying 'no', through near-despair (the word he used as early as 1921). He added to the statement quoted above that the historian "must possess a certain lightness and coolness of mind". This cannot be applied to all great his- torians. And what about Huizinga himself? Yes, in much of his work one will find that quality, and it can strengthen both the charm and the persuasive power. But his profound alarm about the present could at other times crush or scorch that lightness and that coolness. I said a moment ago that it could make him lose sight of the proportions. How obvious this is in those hot-tempered attacks on literary history-writing. But when one looks through the four or five thousand pages of the Collected Works, without skipping the smaller pieces, the indignation about the use of doctorandus as title, about simplified spelling, about the multiplication of universities and technical high schools, about the Dutch flag, which one can see in so many different colour combinations and which some fail to take down at sunset - all that seems at times just a little comic. The interest was intense, but it covered a limited area. In the impassioned effusions of the 'thirties about the decline of our civilization we have seen how large a part of life remained outside it and how as a result the picture was distorted. But it deserves noting that Huizinga's tie with the present should not be described in negative terms only. His irritations and his glooms were the counterpart of positive and fervent feelings of attachment, always, of course, 18 Anyone who has read T. S. Eliot's Notes towards the Definition of Culture (1948; 1962) will be struck by the similarity between his basic views and Huizinga's. In the presentation there are no doubt considerable differences, not all due to Mr. Eliot's anxiety to make concessions and to avoid giving offense to modern democratic feeling.</page><page sequence="30">260 PIETER GEYL towards the social order or forms and institutions fitting in with his con- ception of culture, or which he saw as requisite for it, to the exclusion - this too we have seen - of much that had at least as valid a claim to recognition. I mean the forces of dynamism and of change, in which he would see nothing but destruction. Huizinga's ideal of culture was that of an elite. This elite had not only its intellectual outlook, it had its social structure. As a member of that community he felt "being himself within his class", he appreciated that "noble relationship of service", words which I quoted above. To observe the habits of that group, to conform to its conventions, that he did with con- viction and gracefully. The articles or addresses of homage or commemora- tion such as he wrote or delivered on numerous occasions are always ideal- ized, free from even the lightest reservation or criticism. The "inexorable seriousness" of the historian of which we heard him speak is sometimes wanting in these pieces. It was to him a game. When Ter Braak and Van Eyck explained his shrinking back from The Waning of the Middle Ages and from imagination generally by a desire to be accepted by his Leyden circle as a normal university scholar, they misjudged him (as I said above); but this unmistakable social trait in his way of living must have led them into their error. Ter Braak, mocking at his longing for safety, pictures him at a Faculty meeting, at the editorial board of De Gids, with pinnacles in the shape of honorary "promotions", not forgetting the one by which Princess Juliana received a doctor's degree. I did not know much about that particular "promotion". The speech delivered by Huizinga on that occasion has not been included in his Collected Works. I had to look it up in the Yearbook of Leyden University. I confess that it startled me a little, and I can enter into the feelings of the Utrecht Professor of Ancient History, Bolkestein, who in the Socialistische Gids of 1930 protested against it as an offense against "the respect due to scholar- ship". Huizinga's newspaper article of 1938, on the occasion of the forty years' jubilee of the reign of Queen Wilhelmina - I mentioned it above as representing Dutch neutrality at that critical juncture in so illusionist a light - was also couched in that somewhat high-flown style. We have, so he assures us, passed the years of the First World War safely and honorably, "under the firm hand of Her who bore the highest responsibility for all the difficult decisions." Here speaks neither the historian nor the expert of public law, here speaks the panegyrist. Discussing, in his Homo Ludens, the Baroque, with its "desire to ex- aggerate", "to be understood as proceeding from a strong playful element in the creative urge", Huizinga cites as an example Grotius's dedication of De iure bell ac pacis to Louis XIII of France, who is there in the most extravagant fashion lauded to the skies for his widely famed sense of justice. And he speculates: "Did Grotius mean all this? - Was he, then, lying? -</page><page sequence="31">HUIIZINGA AS ACCUSER OF HIS AGE 261 He played, with the others, on the instrument of the style of his age." Can this be said of Huizinga himself as well? Yes, provided it be added: the style of the age as he understood it, but which had in fact got hopelessly out of date, as is proved by Bolkestein's protest. "A safe history" in order to make sure of "a safe life". Thus Ter Braak rails at the end of his article. It is putting it unkindly. The choice that he demands Huizinga shall make, could not be a choice for Huizinga. Ter Braak argued all too one-sidedly from his own point of view. Combining the two tendencies caused tensions for Huizinga, but if he constantly operated with cautious reservations (cautious, a word that infuriated Ter Braak), it was certainly not so much in order to secure safety for his life as not to detract from critical truth. "Huizinga is no fighter", said Romein, who later on added: "Huizinga was no thinker." A thinker in the sense of a man whose thinking opens up new fields, and who manages to build up his finds into a well-composed whole - no, this Huizinga was not. The Science of History, of which one thinks in this connection, is after all not original enough. Homo Ludens rather im- presses one as a brilliant but wrong-headed improvisation. Huizinga was no thinker, but he was a remnueur d'idees. It is a joy - I often am truly im- pressed - to see him moving in the world of ideas, making subtle distinctions, striking comments, unexpected applications. The spectacle is the more at- tractive for being so unusual among us Dutch historians. But we have observed how, from year to year and sometimes in one and the same argu- ment, he could tie himself up in contradictions. As regards: "he is no fighter" - I should think that in the last decade of his life (after Romein had uttered that verdict) he did reveal himself in that capacity in a surprising way. He fought, it is true, for something that was not worth the effort: for the conservation of that "rich and beautiful culture" from before 1914 (you will remember the phrase), without taking notice of the oppressive and soul-destroying conditions out of which the masses were only just beginning to struggle upwards. But he fought also against the National-Socialist madness, and for the spiritual values that had become consolidated in the imperfect society of earlier generations, and in that fight I can still gratefully honor him. He did not, in my opinion, fight with the most effective weapons. His mixing up the phenomena in Germany and in Russia with what filled him with concern in his own world was an error, and a bad one. But he fought. His error was connected with his blindness for certain realities of life, for politics, for economics, for social evils. I have tried to demonstrate that blindness with the help of his writings, but after his death his friend Heering testified to it expressly in a little book, Huizinga's religieuze gedachten: "a deficiency of social feeling", this, he says, was one of Huizinga's limitations. He could not work up any interest, so he himself admitted to Heering on one</page><page sequence="32">262 PIETER GEYL occasion, "for social or political plans of reform". He turned away from the whole of that sphere of care and struggle; and culture, as he understood it, stood apart from it. Homo Ludens, with that excessive and questionable elevation of play, was inspired by that aversion. Only in noble play did Huizinga feel at home. There he could realize his dream of a world in which the struggle would shed its rudeness and be transformed into a rule-governed tournament with which material interest, gain, improvement of living con- ditions, would have nothing to do; of a safe world, as Ter Braak and Romein put it - I seem to be coming quite close to them after all. I have discussed Huizinga primarily as accuser of his age, and in that capacity I have not been able to say much in his praise. My attitude towards Shadows of Tomorrow, Violated World, and the numerous smaller essays of the disturbed 'thirties and early 'forties when he appeared in that role more particularly, has been largely negative. The state of mind, the direction of his interest and of his indifference, which led him to his errors there, make themselves felt in the historian's work also. Less perhaps than in any other branch of study can a separation between the man and the scholar be made in historiography. So some of the more strictly historical works, too, I am inclined to put aside as errors: for instance Homo Ludens and Change of Form in History, both dating from that last period when the obsession with decline and ruin and the rancor against his own time had taken complete control over his mind. In other of his publications I observe weaknesses which stem directly from the mental attitude I have sketched. There is The Waning of the Middle Ages, which for all that remains a masterpiece; Eras- nIus, which retains great beauties; the works on theory of history, like Science of History, which I have always enjoyed and which despite its shortcomings is full of wise and perceptive remarks. But besides there is much that will always be admired without these reservations: I mentioned the History of Groningen University, 1814-1914, and "The Problem of the Renaissance"; I add now Holland's Civilisation in the Seventeenth Century; but the list is far from being exhausted with these titles. With all this work he remains an imposing figure in our Dutch historio- graphy, and especially, he remains, not on account of that historically flaw- less work alone, but with contradictions, prejudices and all, an uncommon figure. Those eight volumes of the Collected Works sparkle with life. I have not scrupled to speak my mind about him and the defects of his historical vision. In doing so, I have in a way rendered him my homage. He does not leave me indifferent. I remain convinced of what I wrote in 1938 in a review of his Science of History. "We have but one Huizinga."
