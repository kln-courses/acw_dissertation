<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reason, Xenophanes and the Homeric Gods By Paul Feyerabend R 5 ATIONALISM and science are conquering ever-increasing sections of the globe. Education pounds them into the brains of the children of "civilized" nations; development takes care that "primitives" and "underdeveloped" societies can profit from them. Weapons research, which is an international enterprise and independent of political affiliations, introduced them to the very centers of power; even the smallest project has to be adapted to scientific standards to be acceptable. The trend has some advantages, but it also has serious drawbacks. "Development," for example, often created the scarcity it is now trying to remove and destroyed institutions and cultures that sustained the lives of many people. Some critics have these drawbacks in mind when arguing against a further extension of the powers of science. They con- sider problems of life. They want to remove hunger, disease, and fear, but they are aware of the dangers of science-based technologies; they work for peace and the independence of cultures different from our own, but they deny that a scientific rationalism can achieve these aims. Other and more esoteric critics of the present trend also exist. These critics hardly ever descend to such proletarian subjects as sanitation or the possibility of a nuclear war. They are not interested in the day-to-day existence of living things: of women, men, children, dogs, trees, birds. What they are concerned about is the power of special groups. This power, they point out, has suffered as a result of the expansion of the sciences. For example, the humanities now count for much less than the sciences, and a thing called "myth" has lost much of its influence. The criticism is followed by positive sug- gestions: give more money to the arts and the humanities and revive the mythical qualities of human life. The suggestions assume a sharp distinction between pure thought with its artificial categories and myth, or the poetic imagination, which grasps human life as a whole and gives it meaning. Making this assumption the critics overlook the fact that the distinction is itself a rational distinction. They criticize rationality on the basis of categories which were introduced by reason in the first place. Homer did not separate reason and myth, (abstract) theory and (empirical) common sense, philosophy and poetry. Are the "myths" and the "poetic imagination" that modern esoteric thinkers have in mind but mystifications, light-years removed from the past they want to revive and the 12</page><page sequence="2">lives they want to enrich? But how does one react to the phenomena of this world and the opinions and institutions it contains without making use of the distinctions of a rational approach? These are some of the questions I ask myself when confronted with the love some intellectuals show for what they think are old things. To find an answer, I took a look at history and examined how early "rational" critics of tradition proceeded and how their observations were received. More specifically, I analyzed what Xenophanes had to say about the traditions of his time. Xenophanes was one of the first Western intellectuals. Like many of his successors he was a conceited bigmouth. Unlike them, he had considerable charm. He did not present well-constructed arguments-this is why Aristotle called him "somewhat uncouth" and advised his readers to forget about him -but effective one-liners. He crisscrossed Greece and Ionia singing the old stories, but he also criticized them and made fun of them. "He dared, he, a Greek of the sixth century, to reject traditional tales as old inventions!" writes Hermann Fraenkel (Wege und Formen Fruehgriechischen Denkens, Muen- chen: Beck 1968, 341). He still used the old forms such as the epic and elegies. The fragment Fraenkel refers to (fragment B 1 in the numbering of Diels- Kranz) sounds about as follows: Clean is the floor, clean are the hands and the cups; and the garlands freshly now woven, are put on the heads by the boy. Redolent balsam preserved in the phial is brought by another, exquisite pleasure lies waiting for us in the bowl; and a different wine, with the promise not ever to bring disappointment, soft tasting and sweet to the smell stands here in the jar. And in the center the incense dispenses the holy perfume; cool water is there, full of sweetness and clear to the eye. Behold the goldyellow loaves and, on the magnificent tables, overflowing abundance of cheese and rich honey. And in the center an altar fully covered with flowers and festive songs sounding all over the house. But first it is proper for well disposed men to the god to pay tribute with words which are pure and stories that fit the occasion; then, after the common libations and the prayer for strength to act wisely (the most important concern, preceding all others) it is not hybris to fill the body with drink -provided only the old ones need later a slave to get home. And I praise the man who, having imbibed, can still remember how much he achieved and how he followed the virtues. Let him not tell us of battles conducted by Titans and Giants or even Centaurs-the fantasies of our fathers; or of civic dissension-not useful are these events. But one should always pay respect to the gods. This poem has various interesting features. First, the surroundings: it is a somewhat restrained party where one thinks of the gods and does not drink to excess. While some poets, like Alkaeus, praised drinking for its own sake; I3</page><page sequence="3">I4 THE KENYON REVIEW while those who imitated the Lydians "were so corrupted that some of them, being drunk, saw neither the rising nor the setting of the sun" (Athenaeus' paraphrase of the end of fragment 3), Xenophanes advises his drinking com- panions to drink with moderation so that only the elderly will need a slave to get home. We owe the fragment to precisely these observations: the physician Athenaeus of Attalea who lived in the first century B.C. noticed its relevance for medicine and quoted it in his book on dietetics. A second interesting feature is the content of the talks. They are not about wars or epical topics; they are about the personal experiences of the par- ticipants-"how much they achieved and how they followed the virtues." Ac- cording to Xenophanes these matters are furthered neither by Homer (who even in democratic Athens was the basis of formal education (T.B.L. Webster, Athenian Culture and Society, University of California Press 1973, chapter 3) nor by the modern craze for athletics: Let him be swift on his feet and in this way defeat all the others; let him excel in five ways in the grove of the god here in Olympia, close to Pisanian waters; let him wrestle, or master the painful profession of boxing or the terrible contest, known to all as Pankration- greater would be his honor in the eyes of his neighbors. Excellent seats would be given to him at the fights and the games he could eat what he wanted and eat it at public expense; in gifts they would drown him and permanent property would be his due and this also if he had proved his ways with a horse, he, who is lower than I. For my wisdom is better by far than the brute power of men and of swiftfooted horses. No, the custom that puts rugged strength over useful achievements is without sense and should not be further encouraged. Small is the gain for the city that harbors an excellent boxer or a fivefold contestant or winner in wrestling, or an excellent runner who, among all professions engaged in competing is by far the most praised. Short is the pleasure the city derives from a contest in Pisa for it does not fill the stores of the town. "The greedy way in which these men [the athletes] ate, does not surprise us," wrote Athenaeus, who also preserved this fragment. "All participants in the games were invited to eat a lot and also to exercise a lot." To set them up as examples and to revere them is of no use to the city, says Xenophanes. However, Xenophanes not only resisted the cultural tendencies of his time. According to the opinion of most modern thinkers, he also revealed their foundations and criticized them. Above all, he criticized the idea that there ex- ist gods who resemble humans, who are cruel, angry, and treacherous like the heroes of the epic and who influence history. The critique, his later admirers say, led to the rise of rationalism. Is this true? Are Xenophanes' objections to traditional forms of thought really as penetrating and as fertile as is believed by many philosophers? Do they really force us to abandon the old idea of gods who have human features and act in this world?</page><page sequence="4">PAUL FEYERABEND I5 Xenophanes' "argument," as we know it, is very brief. It consists of the following comments: Everything humans despise and condemn and try to avoid, theft, and adultery, and lying deception of others Homer and Hesiod respectfully brought to the gods ... (frgg. 11,12) But the mortals consider that gods were created by birth that they wore clothes, had voices, and also a form. But if cattle, or lions, or horses had hands, just like humans; if they could paint with their hands, and draw and thus create pictures- then the horses in drawing their gods would draw horses; and cattle would give us pictures and statues of cattle; and therefore each would picture the gods to resemble their own constitution. Aethiopian gods-snubnosed and black Thrakians-blueeyed and blond [incomplete] (frgg. 14, 15, 16) Here is what some modern writers have said about these lines. Guthrie (A History of Greek Philosophy, Vol. i, Cambridge 1962, 370) speaks of "destructive criticism." Mircea Eliade, otherwise a very clever gentleman, praises "Xenophanes' acute criticism" (Geschichte der Religioesen Ideen ,Vol. ii, Freiburg: Herder 1979, 407). And Karl Popper who has dragged Xenophanes up and down the countryside as one of his most important predecessors reads the fragments as the "discovery that the Greek stories about the gods cannot be taken seriously because they represent the gods as human beings" (Auf der Suche nach einer besseren Welt, Munich: Piper 1984, 218); he, too, speaks of a "criticism." Xenophanes' positive views about god, or his "theology," are contained in the following lines: One god alone is the greatest, the greatest of gods and of men not resembling the mortals, neither in shape nor in insight. Always without any movement he remains in a single location as it would be unseemly to walk now to this, now to that place. Totally vision, totally knowledge, totally hearing. But without effort, by insight alone, he moves all that is. (frgg. 23, 26, 24, 25) It is interesting to trace the influence of this doctrine in antiquity. We have quotations of key phrases in Aeschylus (compare the first appendix to Guido Calogero, Studien ueber den Eleatismus, Darmstadt 1970) and we have a comment by Timon of Phleios, a pupil of Pyrrho the sceptic (quoted in Diogenes Laertius and, with a slight difference, in Sextus Empiricus, Outlines of Tyrrhonism, 224-A 35 in Diels-Kranz). Timon writes: Xenophanes, semi-pretentious, made mincemeat of Homer's deceptions, fashioned a god, far from human, equal in all his relations, lacking in pain and in motion, and better at thinking than thought.</page><page sequence="5">I 6 THE KENYON REVIEW "Far from human" Timon calls the god of Xenophanes -and he (it?) is indeed inhuman, not in the sense that it left anthropomorphism behind but in the entirely different sense that certain human properties, such as Thought, or Vision, or Hearing, or Planning are monstrously increased while other, bal- ancing features such as Tolerance, or Sympathy, or Pain have been removed. "Always, without any movement, he remains in a single location"-like a king, or a high dignitary for whom "it would be unseemly to walk now to this, now to that place." What we have is not a being that transcends humanity (and should therefore be admired?) but a monster considerably more terrible than the slightly immoral Homeric gods could ever aspire to be. These, one could still understand; one could speak to them, try to influence them, one could even cheat them here and there; one could prevent undesirable actions on their part by means of prayers, offerings, arguments. Personal relations existed be- tween the Homeric gods and the world they guided (and often disturbed). The God of Xenophanes who still has human features, but enlarged in a grotesque manner, does not permit such relations. It is strange and, at least to me, somewhat frightening to see with what enthusiasm many intellectuals embrace this monster, regarding it as a first step towards a "more sublime" interpreta- tion of divinity. On the other hand, the attitude is also very understandable for the remaining features are ones many intellectuals would love to possess: pure thought made efficient by the power of moving everything from afar, super vision, super hearing (for picking up intellectual gossip?)-and no feelings. To summarize: Xenophanes mocks the traditional gods because of their anthropomorphic features. What he offers in their place is a creature that is still anthropomorphic, but inhuman, adding, incidentally (frg. 34), that he has no idea of what he is talking about ("what I said about the gods no human has ever seen nor will he ever know it"). And this Popper calls the "discovery that the Greek stories about the gods cannot be taken seriously because they represent the gods as human beings." I now turn to the critical fragments and my question is: are we here deal- ing with a criticism or simply with a rejection of the idea of regional gods that share the properties of the region they dominate? The answer is: the latter. The rejection becomes a criticism if we can assume: (A) that the concept of a god (or, speaking more generally, the concept of a Truth or of a Being) that changes from one culture to the next is not valid anywhere or, conversely, that a fitting concept of a deity (or a fitting concept of truth or being) must be valid everywhere and (B) that the receiver of the criticism accepts (A), at least implicitly. Only then will the mockery hit its aim. Otherwise, the opponent can always say: "You are not speaking of our gods who are tribal gods, take care of us, look like us, live in accordance with our customs but have superhuman powers. What you are speaking of is an intellectual monster of your own invention which you use as a measure for all other gods. But this has nothing to do with us." The mockery can even be inverted as Timon's characterization shows:</page><page sequence="6">PAUL FEYERABEND I7 "You, Xenophanes," such inverse mockery could point out, "are jealous of Homer's fame, so you want to outdo him and invent a god of your own, bigger than all the other gods, more stiff in his behavior and more intelligent than even you." Many modern authors praise Xenophanes for making assumption (A). Not all of them are sincere in their praise, for not all of them believe that the world is ordered by divine powers. What these writers have in mind is not a super person but something more abstract such as a law of nature, or a univer- sal truth, or a uniform material. Disregarding this feature of Xenophanes' popularity, we must still point out that not all people accepted proposition (A) and that there existed authors and entire cultures, both before and after Xenophanes, who explicitly denied it. Thus Poseidon says in Ilias 15, 187ff [Lattimore tr.]: ... Since we are three brothers born by Rheia to Kronos, Zeus, and I, and the third is Hades, lord of the dead men. All was divided among us three ways, each given his domain. I when the lots were shaken drew the grey sea to live in forever; Hades drew the lot of the mists and the darkness, and Zeus was allotted the wide sky, in the cloud and the bright air. But earth and high Olympos are common to all three. Therefore I am no part of the mind of Zeus. Let him in tranquillity and powerful as he is stay satisfied with his third share. According to this passage the natural world, just like the political world, is subdivided into regions which are subjected to different (natural) laws. E. M. Cornford commented on the passage and explained the terms it contains (From Religion to Philosophy, New York: Harper Torchbooks 1965, 16). Moira, translated as "share," means "part," "allotted part,"-this is also the original sense of "fate" or "destiny." Poseidon's objections show that gods like humans have their morial: each god is given a well-defined part of the world as his field of action. The parts are not only separated from each other, they are also qualitatively different (sky, water, darkness) and adumbrate the elements which started as regions with certain qualities attached to them and only later on became substances that could wander around in the cosmos. The region that is allotted to a god also determines his status (time)-it determines his position in a quasi-social system. The status occasionally is called his privilege (geras). Inside the region the rule of the god is not questioned; but he must not transgress its boundaries or else he encounters offended resistance (nemesis). Thus the world at large is seen as an aggregate with different divinities ruling over different parts of it: (B) is false. The aggregate character of the Homeric world is not restricted to the very laige-it is found in its smallest parts. There are no concepts that forge the human body and the human soul into a unit; there are no means of representa- tion in the arts of the time that would enable the artists to give optical expres- sion to such a unity. Both conceptually and optically human beings are like rag</page><page sequence="7">I 8 THE KENYON REVIEW dolls, constructed from relatively isolated elements (upper arm, lower arm, trunk, neck, head with an eye that is simply put into its region without "look- ing" at anything) and functioning as transit stations for events (ideas, dreams, feelings) that may arise elsewhere and only briefly merge with a particular human being. Action in our sense does not exist in this world; a hero does not decide to bring about a certain event and then cause it. He finds himself in- volved in one series of actions rather than in another and his life develops ac- cordingly. All things-animals, carriages, cities, geographical regions, historical sequences, entire tribes are presented in this "additive manner"-they are aggregates without an "essence" or a "substance." The same is true of world views. In religion we have an opportunistic eclecticism that does not hesitate to add foreign gods to those already ac- cepted, provided their presence promises some advantage; different versions of the same story survive side by side (this was raised to a principle by Herodotus (Histories 7, 152, 3: legein ta legomena) and even the "modern" and already rather desiccated ideas of the Ionian philosophers (Thales, Anax- imander, Anaximenes) do not combat tradition. There is no coherent knowledge, that is, no uniform account of the world and the events in it; there is no comprehensive truth that goes beyond an enumeration of details but there are many pieces of information, obtained in different ways from different sources and collected for the benefit of the curious. The best way of presenting such knowledge is the list-and the oldest scientific works were indeed lists of facts, parts, coincidences, problems in several specialized domains. The gods have complete knowledge. This does not mean that their glance penetrates the surface and perceives a hidden unity beneath events-they are not theoretical physicists or biologists-but that they have the most complete lists at their disposal. Even the early notions of validity agree with this situation: nomos comes from nemein; in the Iliad this word has the sense of distributing, or at- tributing to a certain region. To sum up: (A) and (B) are not applicable to the Homeric World; Xenophanes rejects this world view, but he has no arguments against it. Turning now to authors who wrote after Xenophanes, we notice that some of the most intelligent writers either disregarded him, or went a different way. Aeschylus who was "strongly influenced" by Xenophanes (Calogero, Studien, 293, footnote 16) on the one hand gave the gods greater and more spiritual power and thereby made them less human; on the other hand he let them participate in the activities of the city (Athene, in the last part of the Oresteia, presides over a council containing Athenian citizens and casts her vote side by side with them) and so brought them closer to human concerns. The gods of Aeschylus also acted less arbitrarily and more responsibly than the Homeric gods, arbitrariness and responsibility being again measured by the</page><page sequence="8">PAUL FEYERABEND I9 standards of the city; this brought them closer even to human modes of action than were the gods of Homer and Hesiod. And, of course, the gods of Aes- chylus were still the old gods; there were many of them, not just the one Xen- ophanean powermonster. Sophocles then revived the arbitrariness of the Homeric gods. Trying to explain the seemingly irrational way in which good and bad fortune is distributed among humans, he attributed it to the actions of equally willful and irrational gods (example: Electra, 558ff). Herodotus, whose sentence con- struction (lexis eiromene) and whose tolerance towards conflicting versions of the same story already formally reflect the aggregate view, supported the exis- tence of divine influences with empirical arguments. His analysis of social laws and customs employed a regional notion of validity. It may be summarized in the following statement: Customs, laws, religious beliefs rule, like kings, in restricted domains. Their rule rests on a twofold authority-on their power (which is the power of those who believe in them) and on the fact that it is rightful power. Protagoras extended this view from laws and customs to all matters that are of concern to humans, "ontological matters" included. This was the relativism of Protagoras. The relativism of Protagoras denies the two assumptions that turn Xenophanes' mockery into an argument and thus agrees with basic principles of the Homeric world view. This shows that the followers of Protagoras and Herodotus were not lazy bums who-having reached the limits of their city, their nation, or their cosmic region-stopped searching for a universal Truth or universal Canons of Validity and remained content with a collection of local opinions. Their philosophy was an exact mirror image of a world that had been inhabited by their forefathers and that still guided the thoughts and the perceptions of their contemporaries. Why else would the Platonic Socrates constantly run into people who answered questions such as "What is knowledge?" or "What is virtue?" or "What is courage?" by giving lists? (Com- pare on that point K. Dover, Greek Popular Morality, Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press 1978.) But if the world is an aggregate of relatively independent regions, then any assumption of universal laws is false and a demand for universal norms tyrannical: only brute force (or seduc- tive deception) can then bend the different moralities so that they fit the prescriptions of a single ethical system. And indeed -the idea of universal laws of nature and society arose in connection with a life-and-death battle: the bat- tle that gave Zeus the power over the Titans and all other gods and thus turned his laws into the laws of the universe (Hesiod, Theogony., 644ff). The idea of a universal truth and a universal morality has played an im- portant role in the history of Western thought (and Western political action).</page><page sequence="9">20 THE KENYON REVIEW It is often regarded as a measure by which theoretical suggestions and practical achievements must be judged, and it gave respectability to the relentless expan- sion of Civilization into all corners of the world. The expansion in a very ironical way revealed the violent origin of the expanding cultures: Western achievements were only rarely asked for and Western colonizers were hardly ever invited to bless the Primitives (or the Chinese, or the Japanese, or the In- dians) with their advanced ideas. The comment that relativistic philosophies are of no importance when compared with this almost inevitable development is of course true but only confirms the (relativistic) idea that the popularity of philosophical positions is a result of power (or deception), not of argument: the regionalism of natural phenomena was never overcome, neither by philos- ophers nor by scientists, while the regionalism of social phenomena was repressed or destroyed by violence, not shown to be inadequate by ethical reasoning. Regarding the first part of this statement, the part dealing with natural phenomena, we have to realize that a unified view of the physical world simply does not exist. We have theories that work in restricted regions, we have purely formal attempts to condense them into a single formula, we have lots of un- founded claims (such as the claim that all of chemistry can be reduced to physics). Phenomena that do not fit into the accepted framework are suppressed. In physics, which many scientists regard as the one really basic science now, we have at least three different points of view -relativity dealing with the very large, quantum theory for an intermediate domain, and various particle models for the very small. Without a promise of conceptual (and not only for- mal) unification, perceptions are outside the material universe (the mind-body problem is still unsolved). From the very beginning, the salesmen of a univer- sal truth cheated people into admissions instead of clearly arguing for their philosophy. And let us not forget that it was they, and not the representatives of the traditions they attacked, who introduced argument as the one and only universal arbitrator. They praised argument - they constantly violated its prin- ciples. Xenophanes' mockery is the first, the shortest, and the clearest example of such double-talk. In the social domain the situation is even worse. Here we have not only a failure of theories, but of human decency as well. Only a few proponents of in- tellectual and industrial progress regarded the great variety of views and cultures that populated the earth as a problem for their universalizing tenden- cies, and hardly any politician or colonizer or developer was prepared to argue for things he could get by force (there are exceptions, but they are rare). Thus the increasing uniformity of "civilized" societies does not show that relativism has failed; it only shows that power can eliminate all distinctions. I conclude with an example which shows how uncritically the basic assumptions of Xenophanes (assumptions A and B) are accepted by some of our contemporaries. The example is not a theory, or a philosophical point of</page><page sequence="10">PAUL FEYERABEND 2 I view, but a poem by Czeslaw Milosz. The poem is rather naive and its faults can be shown in a few lines. Does this mean that people have ceased thinking about matters that affect their lives and that empty phrases, artfully put together, are more powerful than even common sense? Xenophanes had strange views-but he showed signs of intelligence (and humor). I cannot detect any such sign in the following: INCANTATION 1 Human reason is beautiful and invincible; No bars, no barbed wire, no pulping of books, no sentence of banishment can prevail against it. It establishes universal ideas in language 5 and guides our hand to write Truth and Justice with capital letters, lie and oppression with small. It puts what should be above things as they are it is the enemy of despair and a friend of hope. It does not know the Jew from Greek or slave from master 10 giving us the estate of the world to manage. It saves austere and transparent phrases from filthy discord of tortured words. It says that everything is new under the sun, opens the congealed fist of the past. 15 Beautiful and very young are Philo-Sophia and poetry, her ally in the service of the Good. As late as yesterday Nature celebrated her birth. The news was brought to the mountains by a unicorn and an echo. Their friendship will be glorious, their time has no limits. 20 Their enemies have delivered themselves to destruction. "Destruction" (line 20) threatens the opponents of a nonregional Reason intent on "manag[ing] the estate of the world" (line 10) without any "filthy discord of tortured words" (line 12); that is, without democratic discussion. This is of course true, but not in the sense intended by Milosz: "destruction" did indeed remove all those small and well-adapted societies that were in the way of the expansion of Western Civilization, even though they tried to defend their rights with "tortured words." Noble Reason, on the other hand, is hardly "invincible" (line 1); prophets, salesmen, politicians trample it underfoot; the alleged friends of reason distort it to make it fit their intentions. The sciences of the past have showered us with useful and terrible gifts-but without employing a single unchangeable and "invincible" agency. The sciences of to- day are business enterprises run on business principles. Research in large in- stitutes is not guided by Truth and Reason but by the most rewarding fashion, and the great minds of today increasingly turn to where the money is, which means military matters. Not "Truth" is taught at our universities, but the opin- ion of influential schools. Not Reason or Enlightenment, but a firm faith in the Bible or in Marxism was the strongest preserving force in Hitler's prisons, as Jean Amery discovered. "Truth," written "in capital letters" (line 6) is an or- phan in this world, without power and influence, and fortunately so for the</page><page sequence="11">22 THE KENYON REVIEW creature Milosz praises under this name could only lead to the most abject slavery. It cannot stand diverging opinions -it calls them "lies" (line 6); it puts itself "above" (line 7); the real lives of human beings, demanding, in a way characteristic of all totalitarian ideologies, the right to rebuild the world from the height of the "what should be" (line 7); that is, in accordance with its own "invincible" precepts (line 1). It refuses to recognize the many ideas, actions, feelings, laws, institutions, and racial features which separate one nation (culture, civilization) from another and which alone give us people, that is, creatures with faces (line 9). This is the attitude that destroyed Indian cultural achievements in the USA without so much as a glance in their direction; this is the attitude that is now destroying non-Western cultures under the guise of "development." Conceited and self-satisfied is this faith in Truth and Reason for which a democratic discussion is but a "filthy discord of tortured words" (line 12)-and also very uninformed: philosophy was never the "ally" (line 15) of poetry, not in antiquity when Plato spoke of the "ancient battle between philosophy and poetry" (Republic 607b6f), not today when Truth is sought in the sciences and poetry is reduced to the expression of feelings. The reason of ordinary people trying to create a better and safer world for themselves and their children-which is reason with a small "r" and not Reason written "in capital letters" (line 6)-has very little in common with these ignorant and irra- tional dreams of domination. Unfortunately, common sense is too common an instrument to impress intellectuals and so they abandoned it long ago, replaced it by their own conceptions and tried to redirect political power accordingly. We must restrict their influence, remove them from positions of power and turn them from the masters of free citizens into their most obedient servants. -: ,\'~~</page></plain_text>
