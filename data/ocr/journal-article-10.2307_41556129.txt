<plain_text><page sequence="1">Achebe's Spatial Temporalities: Literary Chronotopes in Things Fall Apart ana Arrow of God HARRY OLUFUNWA Human perception is most commonly shaped by the ostensibly 'concrete' nature of things, that is, by their existence at specific moments of time and in particular locations in space. In spite of longstanding philosophical enquiry into the issue of 'whether time has a continuous or discontinuous structure',1 there is clearly a close correspondence between the progression of time and movement in space. Indeed, time itself may be said to assume essentially spatial dimensions: it is often conceptualised as a movement from one moment to another, regardless of whether such movement is perceived as being linear or cyclical. As Aristotle observes, 'when some time is thought to have passed, some movement also along with it seems to have taken place.'2 Time expands into past, present and future, the development of such stages strengthening the impression of temporality combined with spatiality. In imagining the present for example, notions of the here-and-now almost inevitably conceive of the 'here' as 'this space' and the 'now' as 'this time', with each term reinforcing the meaning of the other: space is located in time; time moves in space. The literary chronotope (literally, 'time-space') is a concept which shows how such temporal and spatial assumptions play important roles in determining the nature of fictional genres, particularly their themes and structures. According to Mikhail M. Bakhtin, the Russian philosopher and literary theorist who first developed the chronotope as a tool of literary exegesis: In the literary artistic chronotope, spatial and temporal indicators are fused into one carefully thought-out concrete whole. Time, as it were, thickens, takes on flesh, becomes artistically visible; likewise, space becomes charged and responsive to the movements of time, plot and history. This intersection of axes and fusion of indicators characterizes the artistic chronotope.3 Â© CS 2005</page><page sequence="2">50 Critical Survey, Volume 1 7, Number 3 Chronotopes are thus distinguished by the presence of spatial and temporal markers of various kinds which combine in different ways to produce specific effects. This article is an examination of two novels by Chinua Achebe from the point of view of the chronotope, and its main aim is to show the ways in which a chronotopic analysis helps to explicate the issues raised in his texts. In his seminal essay, 'Forms of Time and the Chronotope in the Novel', Bakhtin sets out a typology of major chronotopes which emerge from the various configurations of time and space in specific fictional genres. They include the chronotope of encounter or meeting, in which characters are in the same place at the same time; the chronotope of the road, which represents the temporal and spatial progression of characters over a given area, and the chronotope of the threshold, involving their arrival at life-altering situations with the potential for either progress or disaster.4 To these can be added the chronotope of memory, which is the act of recall and prediction in which the human mind goes back in space and in time to recall the past, or forward to anticipate the future.5 These chronotopes cannot be regarded as constituting totally discrete, watertight categories because they all involve the mediation of the notions of temporality and spatiality in closely interrelated ways. The chronotope of the road, which is associated with movement over time and in space, cannot be considered apart from the chronotope of the threshold, which involves the traversal of critical intersections of time and space, or from the chronotope of encounter, which has as its purview the presence of disparate elements at particular loci in time and space. As given above, Bakhtin's definition of the chronotope appears to contain certain notions of time which, although universal in their essential particulars, are in some important respects different from many indigenous African notions of time. Indeed, as John S. Mbiti claims, '[t]he linear concept of time in [European] thought, with an indefinite past, present and infinite future, is practically foreign to African thinking.'6 Given that the 'mode of perception and apperception of time reveals many fundamental trends of society',7 and since Achebe situates his novels firmly within an African cultural context, there is a corresponding need to establish what African concepts of time are. Discussing the nature of temporality among the Yoruba of present- day West Africa, Wole Soyinka notes, 'traditional thought operates,</page><page sequence="3">Achebe s Spatial Temporalities 5 1 not a linear conception of time but a cyclic reality.'8 It is, he claims, so significant in its continuing influence that it is in fact 'a reflection of that same reality which denies periodicity to the existences of the dead, the living and the unborn.'9 This sense of an integrated temporal completeness, rather than simply 'time as duration',10 is the distinguishing feature of African perceptions of time. Past, present and future do not constitute separate stages which succeed one another in a rigid sequentiality, but are in fact indicative of a complexly realised continuity manifested along different temporal and spatial planes. This idea of cyclical time, which Bakhtin sees as inherently unprogressive - '[t]ime's forward impulse is limited by the cycle'," he states - is from most African perspectives, indicative of an integrated wholeness which the essentially incomplete and neverending linear time does not possess. African worldviews do not commodity time, and its patterned cyclicity works to prevent the development of the adversarial relationship implied in notions of being 'too early', 'too late' or 'just in time', which are expressions of a chronologically specific interpretation of time that is often absurd in traditional Africa. Since African notions of time are usually expressed in inherently communal terms - as age groups and market days, for instance - it is less open to individual manipulation, and conversely, individuals are less likely to be manipulated by it. In Achebe's Things Fall Apart, for example, Okonkwo's wives notice that one of the egwugwu, or masked spirits, 'had the springy walk' of their husband, who is himself nowhere to be seen. The women, however, realise that this seemingly familiar egwugwu is in fact 'one of the dead fathers of the clan.'12 Although some interpretations of this scene claim that Achebe 'makes it quite clear that the egwugwu are ordinary men',13 the central idea is evident: Okonkwo is there, yet he is not; he is present at the proceedings not as a human being but as an ancestral spirit, and even so, the presence of the human is clearly discernible in the 'springy walk'. Ancestral past, human present, the spirit realm and the human world are temporal and spatial categories which seamlessly intersect and merge in the person of an individual in an all-encompassing harmony. This is in accordance with the way in which Achebe continually stresses the 'tripartite relationship between the subject, culture, and time.'14 Another example of the harmonious integration of ostensible opposites can be found in the notion of chi in Igbo cosmogony. As a</page><page sequence="4">52 Critical Survey, Volume 17, Number 3 concept, chi has been subject to much debate, not least due to the different connotations it assumes in varying contexts. Achebe himself identifies two sets of meanings: one is usually translated as 'god, guardian angel, personal spirit, soul, spirit double', the other as 'day, or daylight'.15 However, he claims that in broad terms 'we may visualize a person's chi as his other identity in spiritland - his spirit being completing his terrestrial human being; for nothing can stand alone, there must always be another thing standing beside it'16 (emphasis his). Chi is therefore in a significant way the affirmation of a symbiotic spatiotemporal relationship between human and spirit, and between free will and destiny. It is the integrated comprehensiveness of cyclical time that makes this duality complementary rather than contradictory. As a literary genre, the African novel symbolises the tension between African and Western notions of time and space, especially as they manifest themselves in an African setting. Being a written rather than an oral narrative, it acquires a temporal specificity and a spatial concreteness which stand in contrast to its nearest indigenous equivalent, the folktale, whose content and form often depend on the context of storyteller, audience, and the circumstances in which it is being told. It is significant that Emmanuel Obiechina locates the principal elements of this contrast within the framework of time and space: The novelist can only make sense of individual lives by placing events and incidents connected with them within temporal and spatial dimensions. Within the folk-tale, the essential factors are the moral lessons conveyed by the particular story and its entertainment value.'17 The fixedness of the novel, its realisation as a finished artifact, contrasts with the fluid flexibility of African oral narrative genres, a distinction which is in part the result of the differing spatial and temporal considerations brought to bear upon them. Since it is a literary genre whose antecedents (for many Africans, at least) are Western, the novel form implicitly carries within it western notions of spatiality and temporality, such as the various assumptions and revisions of the unities of time, space and action which seem to be almost inbuilt features of the form. The English novel for instance, has essentially bourgeois roots, and its corresponding emphasis on empiricism, individualism, national consciousness and social propriety were often expressed in overwhelmingly temporal and</page><page sequence="5">Achebe s Spatial Temporalities 53 spatial terms, as can be seen in the chronological and geographic comprehensiveness of early prose narratives like The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe. The significance of these influences on the African novel is strengthened by the nature of the genre's audience, which consists mainly of a literate, Western-educated elite who are, for the most part, eager converts to Western cultural values, including those shaped by Western notions of time and space. Among the better-known examples in this regard are the adoption of Western ideas of 'personal space' (the nuclear family and individual property, for example) as taking precedence over African views of the pre-eminence of 'collective space' (the extended family, communal property), and chronologically-specific time, as opposed to activity-centered time. As a person and as a novelist, Chinua Achebe symbolises this tension between African and Western notions of time and space to a remarkable degree. He is a product of a missionary-based education, one aimed mainly at producing good Christians. However, he was also raised within a still-vigorous indigenous cultural tradition. Thus, he has developed a familiarity with both African and Western notions of time and space, which is seen in his work. It is perhaps this dual heritage which John Updike has in mind when he speaks of the educated African as having 'lived a synopsis of history', having 'outgrown pre-history so quickly that nothing has had time to die; the village gods, the Christian God and the modern absence of God coexist in him.'18 This is an intriguing argument, but one which makes too much of a concession to the impact of a linear concept of time, even though its notion of temporal coexistence fits neatly into cyclical time. Updike appears to assume that different time-stages are incorporated into the psyche of the educated African in roughly equal measure, and are consequently similar in their effects. What is probably more accurate is the idea that the simultaneous presence of two often contradictory concepts of time has led to a state of 'temporal flux',19 an ambivalence which is manifested in different ways, most obviously as culture conflict, and the consequent difficulty of determining what is culturally appropriate in an exceptionally dynamic society. Achebe 's fiction demonstrates an awareness of human lifespans as measured in African age groups as well as European calendar years, and physical space as perceived in Western notions of extent and expansiveness, as compared to African notions of rootedness and depth. This duality of perception is present in</page><page sequence="6">54 Critical Survey, Volume 17, Number 3 Things Fall Apart and Arrow of God and, by extension, in the chronotopes that characterise them. Both novels are particularly suitable for chronotopic analysis because they span the era of British imperialism, a form of domination identified by Edward Said as 'an act of geographical violence through which virtually every space in the world is explored, charted, and finally brought under control.'20 Colonialism as a type of subjugation was a spatial imposition because it involved the conquest of ethnic groups and political entities, and the consequent deprivation of African and other indigenous people of control over their 'territory', a concept which, as Michel Foucault notes, 'is no doubt a geographical notion, but it's first of all a juridico-political one: the area controlled by a certain kind of power.'21 Accompanying spatial dispossession was the curtailing of temporal freedoms as well, for in addition to the forcible introduction of new temporal concepts such as chronological time and the seven-day week, the time of native peoples was no longer their own, subject as it was to colonial requirements. The aftermath of such disruption was cultural chaos, with old values losing much of their force and the new ones which were to replace them being only imperfectly understood. Consequently, few things could be perceived as fixed or certain, and this created a cultural fluidity which permitted the selective application of social mores in different contexts. This is the genesis of what Anthony R. Guneratne calls 'indeterminacies of time and space',22 which he claims are a prominent feature of contemporary postcolonial fiction. Many of the chronotopes in the novels of Chinua Achebe emerge from his sense of the spatial and temporal ambivalence of this era - what he calls a 'crisis in the soul'23 - and the tensions inherent in making the alien genre of the novel serve his purposes. This article organises the more prominent chronotopic motifs of his novels around the major categories of chronotopes that have been identified by Bakhtin himself and by other researchers of the chronotope in fiction. In Bakhtin's own estimation, the chronotope of meeting is 'probably the most important.'24 It is fundamental to plot development and is closely linked to motifs such as 'parting, escape, acquisition, loss [and] marriage',25 all of which play significant roles in the exposition of the events being narrated. At the most basic level, it is characterised by the interconnectedness of temporal and spatial markers, the occurrence of disparate elements converging in the same place at the same time. Indeed, the very notion of the chronotope</page><page sequence="7">Achebe s Spatial Temporalities 55 itself implies a meeting of sorts, the intersection of the notions of time and space. In the texts under focus, the chronotope of meeting assumes a fundamental importance, not just in encounters between individual characters, but also between cultures, and between characters and their fates. Often, these manifestations of meeting are bound together to form a complexly-realised portrait of individuals and communities at specific points in time. Things Fall Apart, as its title suggests, examines the fragmentation of a community and its culture, a process which partly results from the spatiotemporal consequences of its encounter with British colonialism. In the words of Simon Gikandi, 'Umuofla's attempt to represent itself as an organic and unchanging community is always confronted with, and often challenged by, temporal and spatial progression.'26 A character observes that the white man 'has put a knife on the things that held us together and we have fallen apart' (Apart, 1 62). The things that hold this community together are most clearly realised in the encounters of its members within the familiar context of their culture: the assemblies of the various umunna, the adult males, which are the centerpiece of traditional Igbo democracy; the religious ceremonies and festivals through which the people commune with their ancestors and deities, thus reaffirming their sense of solidarity; the primal contests of young men on the proving-ground of the wrestling arena. Communal and ritual encounters such as these are encapsulated in the person of the novel's central character whose achievements exemplify the worth of such ties. Valiant warrior, successful farmer and skilled wrestler, Okonkwo is symbolic of triumph over adversity, seen in his determination to overcome life's obstacles, and conceptualised as his chi's apparent affirmation of his aspirations. In this regard, chi is representative of the meeting of Okonkwo 's human and spirit elements, and their arrival at some form of consensus on the path that his life is to take. It is this culture, and this man, which encounter another culture, one with a very different set of values, and it is a meeting that gives rise to the notion of culture conflict. In Arrow of God, the central conflict stems essentially from a failure to meet, a spatial displacement with temporal consequences. The New Yam festival, which signals the beginning of the harvest season, cannot be announced because Ezeulu, the Chief Priest of Ulu and the community's timekeeper, is in the wrong place - in colonial</page><page sequence="8">56 Critical Survey, Volume 1 7, Number 3 detention - when he should be in Umuaro, and consequently, the start of three lunar cycles pass by unacknowledged by him. It is a spatiotemporal disjunction that symbolises the wider displacement of a culture in a period of crisis in which things are no longer what they once were. The various ritual assemblies of the community still take place, but are tainted by rancour and discord because it is riven by rivalry between powerful deities and their respective chief priests. This antagonism stems mainly from competing perceptions of the true temporal status of the pan-Umuaro deity, Ulu. The community set it up at a specific time and in a particular place, in response to a definite problem (Abam slave-raiding) which it resolved forever. Ulu's supporters recount the deity's coming into being at a timeless period, 'in the very distant past, when lizards were still few and far between',27 thereby endowing it with incalculable age, and by extension, great power. Even though the six villages predate Ulu, the Umuaro creation myth has the 'priesthood of Ulu firmly implanted at its very heart.'28 Consequently, Ezeulu conceives of the deity as a divine creator, 'the god who founded their town and protected it' (Arrow, 15). Ulu's timelessness, linked as it is to the eternal resolution of the problem for which it was established, is thus the basis of a spatial pre-eminence. Ulu's detractors, on the other hand, point to its status as a human creation, imply that it is temporally irrelevant because the end of Abam depredations has caused it to outlive its use, and limit its founding to 'rememberable' time, within the bounds - and therefore the limitations - of human memory. Thus, the Chief Priest of Idemili claims 'every boy in Umuaro knows that Ulu was made by our fathers long ago. But Idemili was there at the beginning of things' (Arrow, 4). Colonial incursion brings this rivalry into sharp focus, for it raises once again the issue of a crisis point in Umuaro history and the need for an extraordinary means of resolving it. Ezeulu's downfall signals the end of Ulu's era and the rise of another belief system, one that is radically different, but in similar fashion draws its strength from the immediacy and coherence of its response to a particular problem in a definite place and at a specific point in time. Indeed, as Neil ten Kortenaar remarks, what is shown is 'not the collapse of one religion and the triumph of another but the flexibility of Igbo beliefs.'29 Meetings, encounters and confrontations in both novels all take place within the context of an era whose own outstanding chronotope is that of the threshold. The advent of colonialism put the continent on</page><page sequence="9">Achebe s Spatial Temporalities SI the verge of momentous change, and a sense of this is reflected in the chronotopes of the threshold which characterise the novels. Some are depicted as specific periods, such as the New Yam festival, while other threshold chronotopes represent particular locations: the obi (father's hut), the ilo (village playground), the marketplace and the Evil Forest. The chronotope of the threshold, like all other chronotopes, is an intersection within an intersection. Within the framework of the meeting of space and time, the threshold signifies the critical intersection of the two notions in a particularly resonant way. It represents the point at which change - whether as improvement or as catastrophe - is at its most imminent. The point at which life-altering decisions are made, this chronotope signifies both freedom and limitation. In this regard, it is not surprising that as central characters, Okonkwo and Ezeulu ultimately become interstitial figures. As suicide and lunatic, each man has moved from the displacement of exile and detention into the dreaded realm of absolute isolation, beyond the spatiotemporal boundaries of his patently communal society. The New Yam festivals in Things Fall Apart and Arrow of God are essentially celebrations of the agriculturally determined traditional Igbo New Year. The sense of an integrated completeness inherent in a cyclical new beginning is seen in the fact that it is as much a reaffirmation of the old as a welcoming of the new. Thus, in Things Fall Apart, it is marked 'to honor the earth goddess and the ancestral spirits of the clan' (Apart, 37); in Arrow of God, the festival 'reminded the six villages of their coming together in ancient times and of their continuing debt to Ulu who saved them from the ravages of the Abam' (Arrow, 201-2). As a reminder of the past, a celebration of the present and an expression of hope in the fixture, the New Yam festival marks a significant intersection of the already interwoven stages of time in the cyclical matrix. It is also a spatial intersection as well, for it is a ceremony that brings the community - and even 'gods and men' (Arrow, 202) - together. As a chronotope of the threshold, the festival proposes both positive and negative kinds of change: it determines the extent of adaptation within the context of traditional culture and thereby marks off the outer limits that are breached as a result of colonial incursion. In Arrow of God, for example, it is the refusal of Ezeulu to declare the day of the festival which triggers the crisis that exposes the limitations of the traditional culture and consequently gives Christianity the opportunity to make inroads. The New Yam festival is literally the</page><page sequence="10">58 Critical Survey, Volume 1 7, Number 3 threshold over which the church successfully steps in its campaign for the soul of Umuaro. Because it is a victory over the temporal limitations of Umuaro, it also indicates the emergence of a new concept of time, a new beginning that will forever change the state of things in traditional society. Just as there are chronotopes of the threshold that occur mainly as time periods, so are there chronotopes that are situated within an essentially spatial framework. This is the case of the obi, 'the large living quarters of the head of the family' (Apart, 192) in the two novels. In Things Fall Apart, the spatial configuration of Okonkwo's compound is simultaneously a testimony to his achievement and an authentication of his manhood: 'He had a large compound enclosed by a thick wall of red earth. His own hut, or obi, stood immediately behind the only gate in the red walls. Each of his three wives had her own hut, which together formed a half-moon behind the obV {Apart, 17). Positioned directly behind the only entrance to the compound, and therefore the hut through which every visitor to the household must pass, the obi symbolises Okonkwo's pre-eminence as family head and protector. Poised on the threshold of the homestead, the obi elicits acknowledgement of its owner's status from all who go through it to enter and to leave. It is the place where many of the rituals of everyday courtesy occur; it is where the head of the family takes his meals and receives visitors; it is where his ikenga, 'the symbol of paternal authority and masculine powers',30 is normally kept; it can only be inherited by the eldest son. The obi is thus quintessential^ masculine space, and, as the site where 'the extended family coheres',31 it is also the locus of almost everything that affirms kinship in traditional Igbo society. While Ezeulu's own obi performs broadly similar functions in Arrow of God, it has an additional purpose, indicated by what Gerald Moore terms its 'special architecture.'32 'Built differently from other men's huts, [it has] the usual ... long threshold in front but also a shorter one on the right' (Arrow, 1). This dual-threshold obi is a strikingly literal example of space shaped to meet the requirements of time: in addition to the usual threshold over which every visitor passes, there is another threshold which Time itself must traverse, its passage in lunar cycles ritually acknowledged by Ezeulu as Chief Priest of Ulu. Being near-synonymous with the identity of its owner, the obi cannot be ignored, as one character points out: 'We do not by- pass a man and enter his compound' (Arrow, 111).</page><page sequence="11">Achebe s Spatial Temporalities 59 As a chronotope embodying both freedom and limitation, the obi is the place where the negative effects of colonial intrusion are most clearly manifested. Like an impudent stranger, colonialism attempts to bypass the owner of the obi by supplanting his values with alien ones. Householders like Okonkwo and Ezeulu who resist or attempt to negotiate terms, are destroyed. The ilo, or village playground and the nkwo, or marketplace (significantly, also the word for 'market day') are like the obi in that they also represent spaces which are symbolic of culturally defined notions of self-perception, but on a more collective scale. As a place which is 'almost as old as the village itself and where all the great ceremonies and dances took place' {Apart, 43) the ilo in Things Fall Apart is an indication of the collective soul of traditional Igbo society. Elizabeth Isichei identifies the traditional Igbo market as 'an institution which marries the dimensions of space and time'33 and in so doing emphasises its status as a threshold marking the boundary of indigenous temporal and spatial categories. In the novel, the ilo and nkwo constitute the backdrop against which Okonkwo is realised; they are the spatial and temporal framework within which his rise to fame and eventual tragedy are worked out. His triumph over Amalinze the Cat which sets off his ascent to greatness occurs on the village ilo; it is in the nkwo that he finds that he has acted alone in beheading the messenger. Ilo and nkwo are thus the poles between which Okonkwo 's fate is charted. In Arrow of God, the marketplace is the place where Ezeulu 's pre- eminence in the life of Umuaro is made most clear as it is the location of the sin-expiation ceremony of the Festival of the Pumpkin Leaves. Ilo and marketplace as thresholds are also the arenas where indigenous and Western notions of authority are contested. In Things Fall Apart and Arrow of God, Umuofia and Umuaro meet in the marketplace to formulate responses to the outrages of colonialism and Christianity, and the lack of effectiveness of such responses indicates the extent to which foreign incursion has debilitated the culture. In the last of such meetings in Things Fall Apart, their deliberations end inconclusively, interrupted by Okonkwo's precipitate murder of the messenger, but even before this catastrophe, it is clear that the clan is able to do little more than bemoan its own impotence: 'This is a great gathering .... But are we all here?' {Apart, 187). The answer is, of course in the negative: ilo and nkwo as expressions of traditional society's communal essence have been</page><page sequence="12">60 Critical Survey, Volume 1 7, Number 3 profoundly compromised by the fragmentation brought about by alien values which celebrate the individual at the expense of the communal. It is one of the more obvious twists of fate that Okonkwo's precipitate killing of the messenger reveals his own sense of appropriate time and place, and this characteristically individualistic act shows just how far he has strayed from the norm. In Arrow of God, gatherings on the ilo and in the marketplace are affected by a similar disunity which signals inherent weaknesses within traditional society itself. Ezeulu's absence from Umuaro, which eventually results in spatiotemporal disruption, is partly caused by those whose dislike of him surpasses their commitment to clan unity. Thus, his request for advice is flung in his face: 'You tied the knot, you should also know how to undo it' (Arrow, 144). Consensus is aborted precisely at the time that it is most vital, and the consequent crisis reveals the damage only when it is too late to be repaired. The Evil Forest, as a chronotope of the threshold in Things Fall Apart, is unique. Unlike the others, it is not in the ordinary sense a meeting place reflective of traditional Igbo society's communal instincts; yet it is a zone of convergence and does reflect divinely sanctioned communal mores. As the recognised site for the disposal of abominations, it is society's spiritual tip, the place where harmful matter is isolated and prevented from infecting the community. A depository for disease, evil magic and culturally unacceptable phenomena, the Evil Forest is 'alive with sinister forces and powers of darkness' {Apart, 138), and thereby representative of chaos - the uncontrolled and the uncontrollable - within the established temporal and spatial framework of traditional Igbo society. The Evil Forest as threshold is yet another arena for the battle between alien and traditional values because its very existence symbolises those beliefs that colonialism and Christianity have come to eliminate. This is why the victory of Mbanta's nascent church in Things Fall Apart is essentially a spatial and temporal triumph: the Christians are given a portion of the Evil Forest, in essence, a 'bad space', which from time immemorial has been associated with things considered spatially and temporally abhorrent - swollen stomachs, osu outcasts and twins; they are expected to die within a specific time as a result of inhabiting this particular space, but actually embark on the creation of additional new space from the Evil Forest on the very day by which they should all have been dead (Apart, 138-40). The continued existence of the Evil Forest guarantees the integrity of the</page><page sequence="13">A chebe s Spatial Temporalities 6 1 beliefs which sanction it; its successful occupation by Christians represents the fatal undermining of that integrity. As Sue Vice points out, the principal way in which memory is represented in the novel genre is through the formal chronotopes of prolepsis (flashforward) and analepsis (flashback).34 Both establish the framework, the 'road' along which the human mind moves in recalling the past or anticipating the future. Such acts of recall and prediction create a parallel set of space and time coordinates which exist simultaneously alongside currently experienced reality. In this regard, the chronotope of memory acquires the characteristics of other chronotopes in addition to its own. It takes on the journey element of the road chronotope, representing as it does movement back and forth over time and in space; it resembles the chronotope of encounter because it involves a meeting between the present and the recalled past or the anticipated future; it also takes on the characteristics of the threshold chronotope, since memory straddles the recollection of the past, the understanding of the present and the anticipation of the future. In a society as communal as that of Umuaro in Arrow of God, it is unsurprising that individual memory is linked to other individual memories, as seen in the way in which several characters attempt to justify the accuracy of their recollections by reference to what they were told by their fathers. Ezeulu's objection to war with Okperi is essentially paternal: 'my father said this to me that when our village first came here to live the land belonged to Okperi' (Arrow, 15). Nwaka contradicts him by drawing upon his memories of his own father: 'My father told me a different story. He told me that Okperi people were wanderers' (Arrow, 16). Memory thus becomes as much an act of ancestral veneration as it is the process of recall; what is being said and heard in the present is validated by what had been said and heard in the past. It is a form of retention which is worthy of keeping, as Ezeulu tells his young son Nwafo: 'A man does not speak a lie to his son. Remember that always. To say My father told me is to swear the greatest oath' (Arrow, 93). Yet the times are such that, far from being sustainable, this time-honoured route to recollection is reversed, and even as he seeks to maintain it, Ezeulu realises that '[t]he world is changing' (Arrow, 45) and attempts to rely on his son Oduche for information about Christianity and the system of knowledge which undergirds it. In doing so, he reverses the assumptions upon which father-dependent memory rest: in getting a reluctant Oduche to do his bidding, he is compelled to address him</page><page sequence="14">62 Critical Survey, Volume 1 7, Number 3 not as a father would his son, but as 'a man would speak to his best friend' (Arrow, 45). Unlike traditional modes of recollection, which appear static and unchanging, Ezeulu predicts a perilous and unstable new reality in which the son rather than the father will be the source of knowledge, as well as of its validation: 'I want one of my sons to join these people and be my eye there .... My spirit tells me that those who do not befriend the white man today will be saying had we known tomorrow' (Arrow, 45-6). The transferrai of recollective authority from father to son is effectively concluded by Ezeulu who demands from Oduche a nimble retentivity in a new locus of knowledge and memory - Western education: 'I want you to learn and master this man's knowledge so much that if you are suddenly woken up from sleep and asked what it is you will reply. You must learn it until you can write it with your left hand' (Arrow, 189-90). The tragedy of Ezeulu, and by extension, of Umuaro is thus, in a significant sense, that of a loss of memory and the paternal reverence upon which it is based. Sent to discover the secrets of Christianity, Oduche comes into contact with a belief system predicated upon the rejection of the past as encapsulated in tradition, and consequently, he finds himself able to do without his father as the primary source of memory. It is unsurprising that he attempts to demonstrate his acceptance of his new-found beliefs by trying to kill the sacred python, an animal called 'father' by the community. In the memory chronotope, the notions of space and time are manifested quite differently from their appearance in reality. Particularly as a recollection of the past, memory appears to telescope space and time, the normal spatial and temporal markers which measure these notions in reality being either absent or radically altered in memory, and as a consequence, particular events become much more marked in their significance. The competing memories of Umuaro 's founding in Arrow of God have already been referred to, and it can be seen that they derive their potency from sharply contrasting perceptions of the longevity of Ulu and Idemili as deities in the memories of their respective chief priests. In Things Fall Apart, space and time in Okonkwo's memories are distorted to a great degree. He appears to be able to remember only his father's 'contemptible life and shameful death' (Apart, 21), a recollection which so dominates his perception of his father that it obscures whatever else occurred in his past. Indeed, it is so pre-eminent in his thoughts that it eventually becomes the sole basis of his behaviour: he</page><page sequence="15">Achebe s Spatial Temporalities 63 is 'ruled by one passion - to hate everything that his father Unoka had loved' (Apart, 17). At crucial points in the narrative, he is moved to act solely by his recollection of what his father had been, and by implication, what he has to ensure he himself never becomes. The distortion of space and time in Okonkwo's memory inevitably carries over to real life; fears and obsessions are transferred from the there-and-then of the remembered past to the here-and-now of current experience through the chronotope of memory. The humiliation of the past gives rise to a fear-driven present and anticipates the frustrations and disappointed expectations of the future. Unoka, Okonkwo, and Okonkwo's eldest son, Nwoye, as anthropomorphic representations of past, present and future, fuse in Okonkwo's memory to provide him with a stunningly brief flash of insight: 'How ... could he have begotten a son like Nwoye, degenerate and effeminate? Perhaps he was not his son .... But Nwoye resembled his grandfather, Unoka, who was Okonkwo's father. He pushed the thought out of his mind' (Apart, 143). Okonkwo's obsession with becoming the exact antithesis of his father makes the uncannily similar dishonour in which both die almost inevitable. In committing suicide, he undertakes 'an ironic retour to the space inhabited by his father'35 confirming that he is, after all, Unoka's son, no matter how strenuously he makes his adult life a denial of that fact. Okonkwo's attempts to be unlike his father ultimately result in the creation of a son who does not resemble him. It is a pattern of contrasts within which the cycle of social failure remains constant, and it is the time- and space-bending chronotope of memory that enables this to be clearly realised. A chronotopic analysis of Things Fall Apart and Arrow of God ultimately reveals that Igboland in the late nineteenth century was just that: a particular location in space and a specific period in time. As has been shown, examining the novels within this framework yields meanings which are surprisingly consistent with the author's thematic concerns. Notes 1 . P.J.
