<plain_text><page sequence="1">American Anthropologist NEW SERIES Vol. 29 OCTOBER--DECEMBER, 1927 No. 4 A SURVEY OF THE MATERIAL AND SOCIOLOGICAL CULTURE OF THE MANOBO OF EASTERN MINDANAO BY JOHN M. GARVAN, M.A. INTRODUCTION THE following synoptical review was written as Chapters II &amp; III of an extensive ethnological monograph on the Manobo of eastern Mindanao, Philippine Islands. The whole manuscript was written for the Bureau of Science, Manila, while the writer was still a member of the now extinct Division of Ethnology during the years 1907-1914. In the preparation of his material the writer had the advantage of having lived, and established schools, among the Manobo for four years, during which time he came to acquire an intensive knowledge of their language and customs. Following that period he lived among them, for purposes of further study, all over the country in the guise of a trader and tribesman, in full conformity with tribal ways, even to the blackening of his teeth and to the growing of hip-long hair. Such procedure, opportunity, and know- ledge gave him a familiarity with tribal ways and modes of belief and such an insight into the inner life of these remote people as would have been otherwise unattainable except after a far longer sojourn. Before entering into the introductory details oYf habitat, etc., it may be well to remark here that in his travels among thirty Philippine tribes, some of them never before visited by white men nor even by Filipinos, and one of them by not even the contiguous tribes, he never experienced the slightest danger either to life, limb, or baggage. His experience leads him to believe that the 567</page><page sequence="2">568 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 29, 1927 danger, hostility and ferocious practices attributed to so many primitive peoples are travelers' fantasmagoria or globe-trotters' colorizations. Good sense, sympathy, courtesy and common ordinary decency go far with tribespeople and bring a reciproca- tion in kind that is so frequently lacking among the great White Tribes. The habitat of the Manobo with whom this article deals covers that huge rectangle of the great island of Mindanao which is included between the central Cordillera on the West, the hinter- land of the Pacific coast on the east, the eighth degree of latitude on the South, and the Northeastern hinterland of the island on the North. The great mass, however, of these primitive tribes- folk live on the middle and upper reaches of the great Agusan river, which spirals its two hundred miles of crocodile-infested, forest-walled waters right through the center of the rectangle from, its solitudinous sources in the South till it debouches its ooze-laden bulk into the seas on the Northern coast. Dotting the banks of the whole Agusan river system-every five, ten or fifteen miles-are the little hamlets of these simple riverfolk. In groups of ten, twenty, thirty houses they stand scattered along the banks in one or two irregular streets-each house perched on its poles above the ground. In the background a few hundred yards away halts the primeval virgin forest, while down below on the surface of the river tug a miscellany of dugouts, at least one for every family head. In the hinterland or over on the other side of the river but far back in the ancient jungle-one, two, three miles-over slimy leech-infested sinuous trails are the diminutive clearings of these primitive husbandmen, each one with its little hut, on which is grown the modicum of rice, yams, and little vegetable odds and ends for the simple needs of the family.' In perusing the following article it must be borne in mind from the beginning that the descriptions and interpretations of 1 Physical characteristics, including anthropometrical measurements, racial relationships, etc., are dealt with fully in the writer's extensive ms. which has been ready for the press for some time and which is now awaiting a favorable opportunity fcr publication.</page><page sequence="3">GARVAN] CULTURE OF MANOBO OF EASTERN MINDANAO 569 Manobo life are applicable for the most part to the Manobo that have been least influenced by civilization and that still live their ancestral lives, uncommercialized, unsophisticated, and un- spoiled, on the upper reaches of rivers and on the serried summits of Sierras, far from the hurry and scurry, bustle and rustle of the busy abodes of Civilization. GENERAL MATERIAL CULTURE Dwellings.-For a home the Manobo selects a site that is clearly approved by supernatural agencies and that is especially suitable for agricultural purposes by reason of its fertility, and for defense, because of its strategic position. Hereon he builds an unpretentious, square, one-roomed building at a height of from 1.50 to 8 m. from the ground. The house measures ordinarily about 3 by 5. Posts, usually light, and varying in number between four and sixteen, support the floor, roof, and intervening parts. The materials are all rattan-lashed and seldom consist of anything but light materials taken from the immediate vicinity. The floor is made of slats of palm or bamboo, the roof is thatched with palm-leaves, and the walls are light, horizontal, superimposed poles laid to about the height of the shoulders of a person sitting on the floor. The space between the top of the walls and the roof constitutes a continuous window. This open space above the low house wall permits the inmates, during a fight, to shoot their arrow at the enemy in any direction. The one ceilingless room serves for kitchen, bedroom, and reception room. There is no decoration or furniture. Scattered around or hung up, especially in the vicinity of the fireplace, are the simple household utensils, and the objects that constitute the property of the owner-weapons, baskets, and sleeping-mat. On the floor farthest away from the door are the hearth frames, one or more, and the stones that serve as support for the cooking pots. A round log with more or less equidistant notches, leading from the ground up to the narrow doorway, admits the visitor into the house. Under the house is the pig-pen. Here the family pigs and the chickens make a living off such refuse or remnants as fall from</page><page sequence="4">570 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 29, 1927 above. The sanitary condition of this part of the establishment is in no wise praiseworthy. The only redeeming point is that the bad odors do not reach the house, being carried away by the current of air that is nearly always passing. The house itself is far from being perfectly clean. The low, cockroach-infested thatch, the smoke-begrimed rafters, the un- swept, dirt-bestrewn floor, the bug-infested slats, the smoke-laden atmosphere the betel-nut-tinged walls and floor, these and other features of a small over-populated house make cleanliness almost impossible. The order and quietude of the home is no more satisfactory. The crying of the babies, the romping and shouting of the boys, the loud talking of the elders, the grunting of the pigs below, the whining and growling of the dogs above, and the noise of the various household occupations, produce, in an average house containing a few families, a din that baffles description. But this does not disturb the serenity of the primitive inmates who laugh, chew, talk and work, and enjoy themselves all the more for the animation of which they form so great a part. Alimentation.-In the absence of such luxuries as matches the fire-saw or friction method of producing fire is resorted to, although the old steel and flint method is employed. The cooking outfit consists of a few home-made earthern pots, supplemented by green bamboo joints, bamboo ladles, wooden rice paddles, and nearly always a coconut shell for receiving water from the long bamboo water-tubes. The various articles of food may be divided into two classes, one of which we will call the staple part of the meal and the other the concomitant. It must be remembered that for the Manobo, as well as for so many other peoples of the Philippine Islands, rice or camotes or some other bulky food is the essential part of the meal, whereas fish, meat and other things are merely complements to aid in the consumption of the main food. Under the heading, then, of staples, we may classify, in the order of their importance or abundance, the following: camotes, rice, taro, sago, cores of wild palm-trees, maize, tubers and roots (frequently poisonous). Among the concomitant or supplementary foods are the following, their order being indicative of the average esteem in which they</page><page sequence="5">GARVANJ CULTURE OF MANOBO OF EASTERN MINDANAO 571 are held: fish (especially if salted), domestic pork, wild boar meat (even though partially putrescent), venison, iguana, larvae from decaying palm-trees, python, monkey, domestic chicken, wild chicken, birds, frogs, crocodile, edible fungi, edible fern, and bamboo shoots. As condiments, salt, if on hand, and red pepper are always used, but it is not at all exceptional that the latter alone is available. Sweet potatoes, taro, tubers, and rice are cooked by steaming. Maize and the cores of palm-trees are roasted over the fire. There are only two orthodox methods of cooking fish, pork, venison, iguana and chicken: (1) in water without lard; (2) by broiling. Python, monkey, crocodile, wild chicken, and birds must be prepared by the latter method. When the meal is prepared, it is set out on plates, banana leaves, or bark platters, with the water in glasses when availa- ble, or in coconut-shell dippers. On ordinary occasions the husband, wife, children, and female relatives of a family eat together, the unmarried men, widowers, and visitors partaking of their meals alone, but on festive occasions all the male members, visitors included, gather in the center of the floor. The hands and mouth are washed both before and after the meal. All begin to eat together on the floor. The men eat with their left hands and, on occasions, when the remotest suspicion of trouble exists, keep their right hand on their ever-present weapons. It is customary not to leave one's place after the meal without giving due notice. Narcotics and stimulating enjoyments.-The most common and indispensable source of every-day enjoyment is the betel-nut quid. It would be an inexcusable breach of propriety to neglect to offer betel-nut to a fellow tribesman. Not to partake of it when offered would be considered a severance of friendship. The es- sential ingredients of the quid are betel-nut and lime, but it is common to add tobacco, cinnamon, lemon-rind, and several other aromatic elements. At times substitutes may be used for the betel-leaf and betel-nut, if there is a lack of either. Another important masticatory is the tobacco quid with its ingredients of lime and mau-mau juice. This is carried constantly</page><page sequence="6">572 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 29, 1927 between the lips. Occasionally, however, the men like to smoke a little tobacco in small pipes or in little leaf cones. The greatest and the most cherished enjoyment of all is drink- ing. Men, women, and children indulge, the last two sparingly. In Manoboland the fame of a banquet is in direct proportion to the number who become drunk, sobriety being considered effemi- nate, and a refusal to drink an affront to the host. The main drinks are of four kinds: Cabonegro toddy, sugar- cane brew, bahi toddy, and mead. The first and third are nothing but the sap of the palms that bear their respective names, the sap being gathered in the same manner as the ordinary coconut tuba. The second or sugar-cane brew is a fermented drink made from the juice of the sugar-cane boiled with a variety of the ginger plant. It is the choice drink of Manobo and of Manobo deities. The fourth drink mentioned above is mead. It is similar to the last mentioned except that, instead of sugar-cane juice, honey is used in its preparation. One feature of the drinking is that it is seldom unaccompanied by meat or fish. Hence, on every occasion on which a supply of these may be obtained, there is a drinking bout. Religious sacri- fices, too, afford abundant opportunity for indulgence. Quarrels sometimes ensue as a result of the flowing bowl and war expeditions are proposed, but on the whole it may be said that the Manobo is a peaceful and a merry drinker. Means of Subsistence.- The Manobo makes his living by farm- ing, fishing, hunting, and his womenfolk clean off the brush, sow broadcast a little rice, plant camotes, some taro, maize, and sugar- cane. As the rice crop seldom is sufficient for the sustenance of his household, the Manobo must also rely on the camote for his maintenance. He obtains his supply of fish from the streams and rivers. When the water is deep and the current is not strong, he shoots the fish with a special bow and arrow. When the water is shallow and swift, he makes use of bamboo traps and at times poisons the whole stream. To provide himself with meat, he occasionally starts off into the forest with dogs and seldom returns without a deer or a wild</page><page sequence="7">GARVAN] CULTURE OF MANOBO OF EASTERN MINDANAO 573 boar. He keeps several spring-traps set somewhere in the forest, but it is only during the rainy season that he may be said to be successful with these. He has a trap for monkeys, a snare for birds, a decoy for wild-chickens, and uses his bow and arrow on monkeys and birds. With meat that he procures from the above sources, together with lizards and pythons, which he sometimes catches, and fungi, larvae, and palm-tree cores which he finds in the forest, he manages to fill in the intervals between the ceremonial and the secular celebrations that recur so frequently during the year, and to keep himself fairly well supplied. Weapons and implements.-The bolo and, in some districts, the dagger, is the inseparable companion of the Manobo. On the trails he always carries a lance and frequently a shield. For war he has an abaka coat of mail and a bow and arrow. In time of alarm he sets out bamboo caltrops, makes an abattis of fallen trees, and places human spring-traps around his lofty house. For work he has a bolo and a primitive adze. These with a rice-header, a small-knife, a hunting-spear, a special arrow for hunting, a fish-spear, and perhaps a few fishhooks, serve all the purposes of his primitive life. With one or the other of these he fells the mighty trees of the primordial forest, performs all the operations of agriculture, of hunting, and fishing, builds himself a house, in certain districts hews out shapely canoes, whittles out handsome bolo sheaths, and makes a variety of other necessary and often artistic articles. They are the sum total of his tools and serve him instead of all the implements of modern civilization. Industrial Activity.-The burden of toil falls on the woman. The man fells the heavy timber once a year, builds the house, hunts, fishes, traps, and fights. Practically all the rest of the daily labor is the woman's share. The man is the master, and as such he attends to all matters that may arise between his family and that of others. Besides the occupations mentioned above, the man may en- gage, usually under the stress of a contract or of a debt, in canoe- making, mining, and basket making.</page><page sequence="8">574 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 29, 1927 The women weave all the clothes of the family except when imported cloth has been obtained. Most of the clothes, both for men and women, are made of native woven cloth. The woman does all the sewing. A needle of brass wire in the absence of an imported needle and a thread of abaka fiber constitute her sewing outfit. Almost all the material employed in weaving is abaka-fiber. The dyes are vegetable, their fastness depending upon the dura- tion of the boiling. The Manobo woman, unlike the Mandaya women and women of most other tribes in Mindanao, has never developed the art of in-weaving ornamental figures. The best she can do is to produce warp and weft stripes. The making of simple earthen-pots is also one of the industries of the woman. Pots are not, however, made in great quantities, the demand being, I think, a little greater than the supply. Bed mats and rice bags are made out of various materials such as pandanus and buri in the ordinary Philippine style. The work is done principally by the woman and the supply is not equal, as a rule, to the family needs. GENERAL SOCIOLOGICAL CULTURE Domestic life; marital relations.-In his choice of a wife the man is guided to a great extent by the wishes of his relatives, but the woman is given no option. There are no antenuptial relations between the pair, the marriage contract and all arrangements being made by their respective relatives. The transactions usually cover years. The woman's relatives demand for her an amount of worldly goods-slaves, pigs, bolos, and spears-that is almost impossible of payment. The man's relatives, on the other hand, strive to comply but make use of every means to gain the friend- ship of the other side and thereby bring about a more considerate demand. When, perhaps after years of effort, an agreement is reached, a great feast is prepared by the two parties. The final payment is made by the man's relatives, and the following day a reciprocal banquet is given by the girl's relatives, in the course of which one half of the value of the payment made by the man's relatives is</page><page sequence="9">GARVAN] CULTURE OF MANOBO OF EASTERN MINDANAO 575 returned by the girl's relatives as an indication that "she has not been sold like a slave." The marriage ceremony consists in the exchange of rice between the bride and the bridegroom. This is followed by a religious rite that consists mainly in determining by divination the fate of the couple. A marriage is sometimes effected by capture, usually, I think, with the connivance of the woman. But the procedure involves a heavier payment to the throng of armed relatives that invariably set out in pursuit of the captor. Pre-natal marriage contracts are rare, but child marriage without cohabitation is practiced to a certain extent, especially among the more influential members of the tribe. The age for marriage is about the age of puberty for the woman and about the age of eighteen for the men. Polygamy is a recog- nized institution, but is comparatively rare except among those who have the means to pay for the luxury of a second, third, or fourth wife. It presupposes the consent of the first wife, who always retains and maintains her position, there being no jealousy, as far as my observation goes, and few domestic broils. Polyandry is considered swinish, and concubinage is unknown. Divorce is not in accord with tribal customs. The same holds true for prostitution. There is no evidence of the practice of endogamy which is so widespread among the Oceanic peoples. As a rule, however, the Manobo marries within his own tribe. This is due to his environ- ment, to the hostile relations he ever holds with surrounding tribes, and to the differences of religious beliefs. The only impediments to marriage is consanguinity, but even this may be removed in the case of cousins by appropriate religious ceremonies. Such marriages are rare. Upon the death of the husband, the wife is considered to belong to his relatives. Upon the presentation of a second suitor, she is re-married in the same manner as on her first marriage, but the payments demanded are not so high. Marriages seem to result in reciprocal good understanding and happiness. The wife goes about her manifold duties day after</page><page sequence="10">576 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 29, 1927 day without a murmur, while her master keeps his weapons in good condition, fishes, and hunts occasionally, goes on a trading trip at times, takes part in social gatherings, lends his voice 'in time of trouble, and goes off to fight if there should be occasion for it. Faithfulness to the marriage ties is one of the most striking features of Manoboland. Adultery is extremely rare. The husband lives, at least during the first part of the married life, with his father-in-law, and displays towards his parent-in-law the same feeling that he entertains for his own parents. His wife is always under the eyes of her own parents, so that he is restrained from indulging in any marital bickerings. Pregnancy, birth, and childhood.-The desire for children is strong. Hence voluntary abortion and infanticide are unknown. In case of involuntary abortion, which is comparatively frequent, the foetus is hung or buried under the house. When the child begins to quicken in the womb, the mother undergoes a process of massage at the beginning of every lunar month. Parturition is effected almost invariably without any difficulty, the umbilical cord is cut usually with a bamboo sliver, the mother sits up "to prevent a reflux of the afterbirth into the womb," the child is washed, and the operation is over. If the mother cannot suckle her child, it is nourished with rice-water, sugar-cane juice and other light food, but is not given to another to be suckled. In a few days after her delivery the mother is up and back at her work. A little birth-party takes place soon after the birth in which the midwife receives a slight guerdon for her service. The child is named, without any ceremony, after some an- cestor, or famous Manobo, or occasionally receives a name indicative of some thing which happened at the time of the birth. He is treated with the greatest tenderness and lack of restraint. As he grows up he learns the ways of the forest, and about the age of fourteen he is a full-fledged little man. If the child is a girl, she helps her mother from the first moment that she is able to be of any service. Birth anomalies are rare. I have seen several albinos and several people who might be called in a loose sense hermaphrodites.</page><page sequence="11">GARVAN] CULTURE OF MANOBO OF EASTERN MINDANAO 577 Medicine, sickness, and death.-The Manobo attributes some twelve bodily ailments to natural causes, for the cure of such he believes in the efficacy of about as many herbs and roots. For wounds, tobacco juice and the black residue of the smoking pipe are considered a very good remedy. Betel-nut and betel-leaf are a very common cure for pains in the stomach. The gall of snakes has a potency of its own for the same trouble. As a rule, all natural remedies are applied externally until such time as they prove unavailing, and the symptoms assume a more serious aspect. Whenever an ailment is of a lingering character, especially if accompanied by increasing emaciation and not classifiable as one of the familiar maladies, it is attributed to magic causes. Certain individuals may have the reputation of being able to compound various noxious substances, the taking of which, it is believed, may superinduce lingering ailments. The pulverized bone from a corpse or the blood of a woman dried in the sun and exposed to the light of the moon and then mixed with finely cut human hair, are examples of such compounds. Other magic medicines exist such as aphrodisiacs, and bezoar-stones. When it is decided that the ailment is due to any of these magic causes, neutralizing methods must be resorted to, the nature and applica- tion of which are very secret. Epidemics are attributed to the malignancy of sea-demons, and by way of propitiation, and inducement to these plague- spirits to hurry off with their epidemic, offering placed on raflets are launched in the nearest rivers. As soon as it is realized that the malady is beyond the power of natural or of magic resources, recourse is had to the deities or good spirits, as will be explained under the head of religion. Upon the occurrence of a death wild scenes frequently take place, the relatives being unable to restrain their grief. Signals, by bamboo horns, are often boomed out to neighboring settlements to warn them to be on their guard. War-raids to settle old feuds are some- times decided upon on these occasions, so all trails leading to the houses are closed.</page><page sequence="12">578 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 29, 1927 The corpse is washed and laid out on its back in its best apparel. The coffin is a hexagonal piece of wood made out of a log with a three-faced lid also hewn out of a log. The body is often wrapped in a grass mat before being laid in the coffin. Before decomposition sets in, the coffin is borne away by men amidst great grief and loud shouts. A high piece of ground is selected in a remote part of the forest for the last resting place of the deceased. A shallow grave is dug out, a roof of thatch is erected, a pot-ful of boiled rice is placed over the grave as a last collation for the departed one, and the burial party hurry back in fear to the settlement. As soon as they can provide themselves with temporary huts they almost always abandon the settlement. Social and family enjoyment.-Music, instrumental and vocal, and dancing are the two great sources of domestic enjoyment. There are several kinds of instruments, which I will mention in the order of their importance and frequency of use. The drum, the gong, four varieties of flutes, four species of guitars, a violin, and a Jew's harp. With the exception of the first two, the in- struments are made of bamboo and are, in every sense of the word, of the most primitive kind. The strings are of vine, bamboo, or abaka fiber. The drum is the instrument of most frequent use. It is played during all dancing and at other times when a tribesman feels in- clined. It is used as a signal to give alarm or to call an absent one. During the dance, religious or secular, it is nearly always ac- companied by the gong. The use of the other instruments seems to depend upon the caprice of the individuals, though two of them appear to have a religious character. With the exception of the gong and the jew's harp, all of these instruments can be made to produce varied and pleasing rhythm or music, according to the knowledge and skill of the performer. Each strain has its appropriate name, taken frequently from the name of the animal that it is supposed to imitate. Instrumental music, in general, is of minor tonality, melancholy, weird, and suggestive in some ways of Chinese music. Bamboo stampers are sometimes used to give more animation to a dancing celebration, and bamboo sounders are attached to looms to draw attention to the industry of the weaver.</page><page sequence="13">GARVANJ CULTURE OF MANOBO OF EASTERN MINDANAO 579 Songs are always sung as solos. They are all extemporaneous and for the most part legendary. The language is archaic and difficult for an outsider to understand. The singing is a kind of declamation, with long slurs, frequent staccatos, and abrupt end- ings. Of course, there are war-songs that demand loudness and rapidity, but on the whole the song-music is as weird and melan- choly as the instrumental. Ceremonial chants do not differ from secular songs, except that they treat of the doings of a super- natural world, and are the medium through which supplications are made to supernatural beings. Perhaps the greatest of all social enjoyments, both for men and deities, is the dance. It is performed by one person at a time. Men, women and children take part. Dressed in a woman's skirt and decked out in all obtainable finery, the dancer keeps perfect time to the rhythm and clang of the gong. System of government, political organization, and social control. Manoboland is divided into districts, more or less extensive, which are the property of the different clans. Each district is under the nominal leadership of the warrior-chiefs and of the more influential men. In time of peace, these districts are open to everybody, but in time of war-and wars were formerly very frequent-only persons of tried friendship are permitted to enter. A clan consists of a chief whose authority is merely nominal, and a number of his relatives varying from twenty to perhaps two hundred souls. The whole system is patriarchal, no coercion being used unless it is sanctioned by the more influential members, and approved by the concensus of opinion of the people, and in accord with traditional custom. The authority of the elder people is respected as long as they are physically and mentally able to participate in public gatherings. Those who have distinguished themselves by personal prowess always command a following, but they have a greater influence in time of trouble than in time of peace. Perfect equality reigns among the members of the clan except in the one respect that the recognized warriors are entitled to the use of a red head-kerchief, jacket, and pantaloons, each of these articles, beginning with the first being added as the number of people whom the warrior has killed is increased.</page><page sequence="14">580 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 29, 1927 The chieftainship naturally falls to one who has attained the rank of bagani, that is to one who has killed a certain number of persons, provided he is otherwise sufficiently influential to attract a following. His duties consist in lending his influence to settle a dispute and in redressing the wrongs of those who care to appeal to him. As a priest he is thought to be under the protection of a war-god, whose desire for blood he must satisfy. The bagani also acts as a medicine man, for he is reputed to have certain magic powers both for good and for evil. The natural secretiveness of the bagani made it difficult for me to secure much information on this point, but his power of harming at a distance and of making himself invisible are matters of general belief. In his character as a priest, he performs ceremonies for the cure of diseases in which fluxes of blood occur. Methods of warfare. There is no military organization in Mano- boland. The greater part of those who form a war-party are rela- tives of the aggrieved one, though it is usual to induce others of acknowledged prowess to take part. No resentment is harbored by the opposing party toward paid warriors. Vendettas and debts are the most usual cause of war, and not, as has been reported, glory and the capture of slaves. There is never wanting on the part of those who originate the war a reasonable motive. The vendetta system is not only recognized, but vengeance is considered incumbent on the relatives of one who has been killed, and, as a reminder, a piece of green rattan is some- times strung up in the house. The rattan suggests that until it rots the wrong will not be forgotten. If the father is unable to avenge the wrong, he bequeathes the revenge to his sons as a sacred legacy. Sometimes another person is deputed to take vengeance, in which case no blame is attached to him. The peculiar custom prevails of killing a third party who may be neutral, or of seizing his property, but I have known such an act to be resented. As a result of this custom a war-party return- ing from an unsuccessful raid is dangerous. There is usually no formal declaration of war. In fact, the greatest secrecy is generally observed, and in urgent cases a body of ambushers proceed at once to kill the first one of the enemy</page><page sequence="15">GARVAN] CULTURE OF MANOBO OF EASTERN MINDANAO 581 that happens to pass their lurking-place. As a rule the location of the enemy's house and his actions are watched for weeks, perhaps for years, until a favorable opportunity for attack presents itself. The usual time for undertaking an expedition is during the rice- harvest and after a death. The preparation consists in acquiring a thorough knowledge of the enemy's house and its environment. Everything being ready, the warriors assemble, a sacrifice is made, omens taken, and the band starts out at such an hour as will enable them to reach the vicinity of the enemy about nightfall. From the last stopping-point a few warriors make a final reconnaissance in the gloom of the night, release the enemy's traps, and return. The whole band, numbering anywhere from ten to one hundred, advance, and, surrounding the house, await the dawn, for it is at the first blush of the morning that sleep is supposed to be the heaviest. Moreover, there is then sufficient light to en- able the party to make the attack. Hence the peep of dawn is al- most always the hour of attack. If the enemy's house is within spear-reach, it is usually an easy matter to put the inmates to death, but if it is a high house, and especially, if the inmates are well prepared, a warrior climbs up silently under the house and spears one of them. This, followed by the killing of pigs and by the battle-cry, usually causes consterna- tion. A battle of arrows then takes place, there is a bandying of fierce threats, taunts, and challenges, and the attacking party endeavors to set the roof on fire with burning arrows. If they succeed the inmates flee from the flames, but only the children, as a rule, escape the bolo and spear. It is seldom that the attack is prolonged for more than a few hours and it is seldom that the attack is unsuccessful, for if other means fail hunger and thirst will drive the besieged ones to flight, in which case they become the victims of the besieging warriors. If one of the latter is wounded or killed, the attack is abandoned at once, such an occurrence being considered extremely in- auspicious. Each warrior gets the credit for the number of people whom he kills, and is entitled to the slaves that he may capture. The warrior-chiefs open the breasts of one or more of the headmen of</page><page sequence="16">582 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 29, 1927 the slain, insert a portion of their charm-collars into the opening, and consume the heart and liver in honor of their war-spirits. During the return home, the successful warriors make the forest resound with the weird ululation of the battle cry, and adorn their lances with palm-fronds. Upon arrival at their settle- ment, they are welcomed with drum and song and loud acclaim. A purificatory bath is followed by a feast in which each one recounts the minutest details of the attack. After the feast some of the captives may be given to warriors who were unlucky or who desire to satisfy their vengeance. The captives are oc- casionally despatched in the nearby forest. Ambush is also a very ordinary method of warfare. Several warriors station themselves in a selected position near the trail and await their enemy. Whenever there is open rupture between two parties, it is customary for each one of them to erect a high house in a place remote and difficult of access, and to surround it with such obstacles as will make it more dangerous. In these houses, with their immediate relatives, and with such warriors as desire to take their part, they bide their time in a state of constant watch and ward. When both parties in a feud are tired, either of fighting constantly or of taking refuge in flight, a peace-making may be brought about through the good services of friendly and influential tribesmen. On the appointed day, the parties meet, balance up their blood debts and other obligations and decide on a term within which to pay them. As an evidence of their sincere desire to preserve peace and to make mutual restitution, a piece of green rattan is cut by the leaders, and a little beeswax is burnt,; both operations being symbolic of the fate that will befall the one that breaks his plighted word. Intertribal and analogous relations. Intertribal relations between pagan Manobo and Christianized Manobo, and between the former and Bisaya, were comparatively pacific during my residence in the Agusan Valley. Between Manobo and other mountain tribes, excepting Mangguangan, the relations were, with casual excep- tions, rather friendly, due, no doubt, to the lessons learned by the</page><page sequence="17">GARVAN] CULTURE OF MANOBO OF EASTERN MINDANAO 583 Manobo in their long struggles with Mandaya, Banuaon, and Dibabaon up to the advent of the missionaries about 1877. The Manobo are inferior to the tribes mentioned in tribal cohesion and in intelligence. Their dealings, however, with Mangguangan who are undoubtedly their physical and intellectual inferiors, present a different aspect. With the Mandaya and Dibabaon, they have helped to reduce the once extensive Mangguangan tribe to the remnant that it is today. Manobo and other mountain tribes have very little to do with each other. Only particular individuals of the various tribes, who have the happy faculty of avoiding trouble, travel among other tribes. In general, Manobo are afraid of the aggressiveness of their neighbors (excluding the Mangguangan), and their neighbors fear Manobo instability and hot-headedness, hence both sides pursue the prudent policy of avoidance. Inter-clan relations have been comparatively peaceful since the establishment of the special government in the Agusan Valley. Occasional killings took place formerly and probably still take place in remote regions, notably on the upper Baobo. It is probable that, since my departure from the Agusan in 1910, these murders take place much less frequently, as the special government organ- ized in 1907 has made great headway in getting in cotitact with the more warlike people of the interior. Up to the time of my departure dealings between the various clans were purely commercial and of a sporadic nature. Old enmities were not forgotten, and it was considered more prudent to have as little as possible to do with one another. On all occasions when there is any apprehension of danger arms are worn. During meals, even on festive occasions, the Manobo eats with his left hand, holding his right in readiness for an attack. The guests at a feast are seated in such a way that an attack may be easily guarded against. Various other laws of intercourse, such as those govern- ing the passing of one person behind another and unsheathing a bolo, regulate the dealings of man with man and clan with clan. Commercial relations between the Bisaya and Manobo, both pagan and Christianized, constitute, on the part of the first mentioned, (Bisaya) a system of deliberate and nefarious spoliation</page><page sequence="18">584 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 29, 1927 which has been denounced from the time of the first missionaries and which, by the establishment of trading-posts by the govern- ment, eventually will be suppressed. Absolutely inadequate values both in buying and selling commodities, use of false weights and measures, defraudation in accounts, demands of unspeakably high usury, wheedling by the puanak or friendship system, advancing of merchandise at exhorbitant rates, especially just before the rice-harvest, and the system of commutation by which an article not contracted for was accepted in payment at a paltry price,-these were the main features of the system. It may be said that the resultant and final gain would amount to between 500 and 1000 per cent. The bartering was carried on in a spirit of dissimulation, the Manobo being cozened into the idea that the sale was an act of friendship and involved a comparative loss on the part of the Bisaya. A period, more or less extended, was allowed him wherein to complete the payment, with a promise of further liberal advances. Since the Manobo has become aware of the stupendous gain of the Bisaya, he is not so prompt in his payments and in fact often thwarts his creditor by deliberate delays. Hence the frequent bickerings, quarrels, and ill-will that are ever a result of these commercial relations. It is needless to say that throughout the valley there was great fluctuation of prices. Moreover the Manobo sold a part of his rice in harvest time at 50 centavos a sack, and in time of scarcity repurchased it at as much as 5 pesos. The internal commerce of the Manobo presents, on the whole, a very different spectacle. It consists in simple exchanges. There is no circulation medium. The units of exchange are slaves (valued at from 15,00 to 30,00 pesos each), pigs, and plates, but with the exception of the first, these units are not constant in value. The measures used are the gantang, a cylindrical wooden vessel with a capacity of from 10 to 15 liters; the kaban2 which contains 25 gantang; the yard, measured from the end of the thumb 2Called also bakid and anega. A kaban is measured by counting 25 gantang.</page><page sequence="19">GARVAN] CULTURE OF MANOBO OF EASTERN MINDANAO 585 to the middle of the sternum; the span, the fathom, the finger, and the finger joint. Slavery is a recognized institution, but since the diminution of intertribal and inter-clan wars the number of slaves has diminished. Slaves were originally obtained by capture and then passed from hand to hand in making marriage payments. It sometimes occurs, in an exigency, that a man delivers a child, even his own, into captivity. The slave is not generally ill-treated but has to do all the work that is assigned to him. He has no rights of any kind, possesses no property except a threadbare suit, and is usually not allowed to marry. However, he receives a sufficiency of food and seems to be contented with his lot. Administration of justice: general principles and various laws. It is frequently stated by Bisaya and others that Manobo justice consists in the oppression of the weak by the strong, but I have not found this to be true. The Manobo is too independent and too much a lover of revenge to brook coercion. He recognizes a set of customary rules, and any departure from them is resented by him and by his relatives. Nearly all the violations of right are considered as civil, and not as criminal wrongs, and upon due compensation are condoned. Failure on the part of the offender to make this compensation leads the aggrieved man and his relatives to take justice into their own hands. The guilty one in nearly every case is allowed a. fair and impartial hearing in the presence of his own relatives. The matter is argued out, witnesses are called, and the offender's own relatives generally exert their influence to make him yield with good will. Hence the feast that follows nearly every case of successful arbitration. One of the fundamental customs of the Manobo is to regard as a duty the payment of one's debts, and this duty is performed sacredly and often at a sacrifice. Another fundamental custom is the right of revenge. Revenge is a sacred duty that is bequeathed from generation to generation, and from it result the long and terrible feuds that have devastated Manoboland.</page><page sequence="20">586 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 29, 1927 Customary law is based on the intense conservation of the Manobo, fostered by the priests and strengthened by a system of religious injuctions and interdictions. Anyone who violates these taboos or interdictions becomes liable for all the evil consequences that may follow. Property rights are understood and rigidly upheld, so much so that there seems to be no conception of a gift as such. Large tracts of land are considered the property of a clan, but anyone on good terms with the clan may settle on the land and may have all the rights of a clansman except those of fishing. Each individual becomes the temporary owner of the land that he selects and of the crops that he plants thereon. As soon as he abandons the land it becomes the collective property of the clan. Land disputes are unknown. Property that is the result of one's labor or of one's purchase belongs to the individual except in the case of women, children, and slaves. Loss of, and damage to, property belonging to another must be made good, no excuse being admitted. The law of contracts is stringent, but a certain amount of consideration is shown in case of a failure to fulfill a contract on time, unless a definite stipulation to the contrary has been pre- viously made. All contracts are made in the presence of witnesses, and frequently a knotted rattan slip, representing the number of items or the number of days to elapse before payment, is delivered by the one who makes the contract. Nearly all transactions are made on a credit basis, hence frequent disputes arise out of the failure of one party or the other to fulfill the terms of the contract. The failures are sometimes due to the fact that one individual man depends on payment from another in order to satisfy his debt to a third party. Undue delay on the part of a debtor finally gives the creditor the right to seize the property of the debtor,, or even the property of a third party. Such an action is not common and is always taken under the stress of exasperation after repeated effort to collect have proved unavailing. As a rule the relatives of the debtor prefer to settle the obligation rather than to allow matters to become too serious,</page><page sequence="21">GARVAN] CULTURE OF MANOBO OF EASTERN MINDANAO 587 but it happens at times that they, too, are obstinate and allow things to take their course. No interest is charged on loans except in the case of paddy. There are few loans made, and no leases or pledges. These last imply a distrust that is not pleasing to the Manobo. The law of liability is very strict, For instance, if one should ask another to accompany him on a journey and the latter should fall sick or die, the former would be liable for his death. If one should die in the house, thereby causing the abandonment of it, the relatives of the dead man would have to pay the value of the house. Similar instances are of frequent occurrence and can be readily understood. This liability law extends to evils supposed to be due to the violation of taboos and to the possession of magic powers. There is a system of fining that serves, harsh though it may seem, to maintain proper deference to the person and the property of another. Thus, spitting on another, rudely grasping another's person, entering another's district without due. permission, fishing in a river without the owner's leave, are a few of the many cases that might be adduced. The fine varies according to the damage and amount of malice that may be proved in the subsequent arbi- tration. Regulations governing domestic relations and property, customary procedure in settlements of disputes. The house belongs collectively to the builders. The property in it belongs to the male inmates who have acquired it. The elder brother takes possession of the property of his deceased brother, unless the eldest son of the deceased is of such an age as to be capable of managing the household. In case the deceased did not have a brother, a brother-in-law or son-in-law becomes the representative of the household. The eldest son inherits his fathers debts and must pay them. There is so little property in the ordinary Manobo home that there are no disputes as to the inheritance. After a death the house is abandoned and the grief-stricken relatives scurry off with their baskets, mats, and simple utensils to make another home in a solitary part of the forest.</page><page sequence="22">588 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 29, 1927 The relations both prenuptial and postnuptial between the sexes are of the strictest kind. All evil conduct from adultery down to immodest gazing is punished with appropriate fines and even with death. The fines vary from the equivalent of three slaves down to that of a few pesos. The marriage contract is very rigid. I know of few cases in which the stipulated price was not paid prior to the delivery of the fiancee. In case of the death of one of the affianced parties the payments made must be refunded. In case of the refusal of the bridegroom to continue his suit even though there has been a fault on the part of the bride or of her relatives, he loses all right to recover. Should the bride's people, however, decide to discontinue the proceedings, they must return the previous pay- ments and ,make compensation for the trouble and expenses incurred during the previous transactions. No case of a discon- tinuance of the marriage proceedings ever passed under my observation. The father has theoretically full power over his wife and children, but in practise his domestic jurisdiction is of the most lenient kind. Marital affection and filial devotion reign in the household. The husband may not marry a second wife during the lifetime of the first without the latter's consent. This rule, as well as the lack of sufficient wordly possessions to purchase another helpmate, makes polygamy comparatively infrequent. The bridegroom is supposed to live with his father-in-law or with the previous owner of his wife, very often with his wife's brother, but nearly always sets up his own establishment a few years after marriage. With the exception of adultery, fornication, rape, and wanton homicide, all crimes presuppose an appeal to arbitration. The author of another's death is the one on whom vengeance must be taken if it is possible. When an outraged party is unable to obtain redress by arbitra- tion or by direct reprisal, he avenges himself on a third part, preferably a relative of his enemy, by killing him or by seizing his property. He thus brings matters to a head. It is usual to</page><page sequence="23">GARVAN] CULTURE OF MANOBO OF EASTERN MINDANAO 589 compound with the relatives of this third party, either for the death or for the seizure, on condition that they will league them- selves with the one who is seeking revenge against the original wrongdoer or that they themselves will undertake, as his paid agent, to wreak vengeance on his enemy. Minor offences are punished by fines that are determined by arbitration. These fines vary in amount, but nearly always include a feast, more or less elaborate, the expenses of which are borne by that party that lost the case. The arbitration of a question may be made immediately after it has arisen or it may not be brought for weeks or months. When the discussion has begun it is not considered politic for either side to yield at once. Threats are bandied between the principals until, through the influence of friendly chiefs, they are brought together. Then the relatives discuss the affair, each side exag- gerating its own view of the question. It is only after lengthy dis- cussions, and the use of similitudes and allegories, loud shouts, dissimulation, and through the sagacity and influence of the chief men that the opinions of the parties are so molded that an agree- ment is reached. It may be necessary to determine the offence. This is done by witnesses who give, as far as I have been able to judge, truthful testimony. Whenever the veracity of a witness is doubted he may be obliged to take a kind of oath which consists in the burning of beeswax. In the case of suspects, ordeals are employed. They consist of making the parties under suspicion either plunge their hands into boiling water, or undergo the diving test, or take the candle ordeal. Circumstantial evidence is admissible. By means of it the authors of hidden crimes are often brought to punishment after years of patient waiting. It is customary for the guilty one to make at least a partial payment immediately after the arbitration, and to treat the assembly to a banquet in which it is good form for the two op- ponents to close the breaches of friendship by generous quaffs to each other's health.</page><page sequence="24">590 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 29, 1927 RELIGIOUS IDEAS Survey of religion.-A study of Manobo religion is difficult be- cause of the natural secretiveness and suspiciousness of this primitive man, because of his dependence for his religious ideas on his priests, because of variations and apparent contradictions that arise at every step and finally, because of his inability to expound in a satisfactory manner the beliefs of his religious system. The religious belief of the Manobo is an essential part of his life. On his person he often carries religious objects. The site for his home is not selected till omens and oracles are consulted. In his method of cooking there are religious rules. He cannot procure his meat from the forest nor his fish from the streams without making an appropriate offering. He sows and harvests his rice under the auspices of certain deities. His hunting dogs are under the protection of a special divinity. His bolo and his spear must answer a special magic test. He cannot go forth to fight till divination and sacrifice have assured him success. All the great events of his life-his marriage, the pregnancy and parturition of his wife, death, burial, war-all are consecrated by formal, and often public, religious rites. As far as I have been able to judge, fear of the deities, of evil spirits, of the dead, of all that is unintelligible, unusual, somber, is the mainspring of the Manobo's religious observances and beliefs. In order to detect the evils, natural and supernatural, to which he may be exposed, he has recourse to dreams, divination, auguries and omens, and, in more serious cases he calls upon his priest to ascertain by invocation, oblation and sacrifice, the course of the evil that has befallen him, or of the danger that he fears. Though there are two principal classes of beneficent divinities, little is known of one of these classes beyond its supposed existence. The other class is made up of humanlike deities called diuata, that retain a fondness for this world and the good things thereof. They select mortals for their favorites, and, through them, keep themselves provided with such earthly delicacies as they may desire, even though they may have to plague their mortal votaries in order to secure them.</page><page sequence="25">GARVAN] CULTURE OF MANOBO OF EASTERN MINDANAO 591 There is another catagory of spirits of a slightly different character whose desire is blood. These are the war-divinities that select certain individuals for their champions and urge them on to deeds of valor, with the hope of procuring blood. In contradistinction to the above divinities are others of a malignant or dangerous character. Chief among them are the busau, black, hideous spirits that dwell in dark desolate places, and who are for the most part implacable enemies of man. To counteract the machinations of these spirits, the beneficent deities are called upon by Manobo priests, and feasted with song and dance and sacrifice. Pleased with these tokens of friendship, the good spirits pursue the evil ones, and even engage in battle with them. The tagbanua are a class of local spirits that reign over the forest tracts and mountains. They are not of an unkindly nature as long as a certain amount of respect is paid them. Hence the practice of making offerings during hunting and other forest occupations. Among the other inimical spirits are the rice-pilferer Dagau; Anit the thunderbolt-spirit; numerous epidemic-demons; the goddess of consanguinous love and marriage; the spirit of sexual excess; the wielder of lightning, and the manipulator of the winds and storms; the cloud-spirit and various others. Agricultural and hunting operations are all performed under the auspices of gods and goddesses. Thus Hakiadan, and Tap- hagan take care of the rice during sowing and harvest time respectively; Tagamaling attends to other crops; Libtakan is the god of sunshine and good weather; and Sugujun is the god of the chase. There are other gods-Mandait, the birth-deity; Ibu, the goddess of the after-world; Makalidung, the founder of the world; Manduyangit, the ferryman; and Yumud, the water-wraith. The performance of nearly all the greater religious rites is left to the priests who are of two classes,-bailan or ordinary priests, and bagani or war-priests. It is the prerogative of these priests to hold communication with their familiar spirits, to find out from them their desires, to learn the doings of the unfriendly spirits, and the means to be taken for a mitigation of the evil in question.</page><page sequence="26">592 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 29, 1927 The ordinary priests are simple intermediaries, claiming no wondrous powers, making use of no deceptive nor mercenary methods, as far as my observation goes, with no particular dress and little paraphernalia, having no political influence, but possess- ing, in all that concerns religion, paramount authority. Their title to priesthood is derived from the violent manifestations (such as trembling, perspiring, belching, semi-unconsciousness) that are believed to be a result of communication with their familiars. The war-priests have blood-spirits for their favorites and, accordingly, perform their rites only in matters that concern war and wounds. Ceremonial accessories consist of a few heirlooms, a small altar-house, a wooden oblation tray, a one-legged stand, a sacri- ficial table, ceremonial decorations, sacred images, and sacrificial offerings. The religious rites peculiar to the ordinary priests, consist of betel-nut offerings, the burning of incense, invocations, prophy- lactic fowl-waving, omen-making, blood unction, the shield ceremony, the death-feast, the rice-planting ceremony, the hunt- ing rite, and the sacrifice of pig and fowl. The ceremonies peculiar to the warrior-priests are-besides the betel-nut tribute to the war-spirits and invocation offered to them- : invocation and offerings to the spirit-companions or "souls" of the living enemy, special forms of divination connected with war, a special invocation to the omen bird preparatory to the war-raid, placation and propitiation of the tutelary war-deities by invocation, by sacrifices and by ceremonial cannibalism. The main features, then, of the Manobo religious system are:- (1) A firm, traditional belief in the existence of anthropomorphic beneficent deities that will help the Manobo if he supplies them with the offerings they desire but if not, that will allow and even cause evil to befall him. (2) A belief in the existence of forest-spirits and sky-spirits, who on occasions may become hostile and must be propitiated. (3) An absolute reliance on priests, who are the favorites of one or more of the friendly divinities, and through whose mediation he secures their good will and assistance. (4) The fear of the dead who are thought to harbor an envious feeling toward the living.</page><page sequence="27">GARVAN] CULTURE OF MANOBO OF EASTERN MINDANAO 593 (5) The frequent consultation or interpretation of omens, auguries and oracles for ascertaining future events. (6) A rigid adherence to a numerous set of taboos, some based on religious ideas, some founded on sympathetic magic. (7) A frequent application of the principle of sympathetic magic by which one act is believed to be productive of a correlated result. (8) A conscientious avoidence of everything disrespectful in word and act towards one of the brute creation. (9) A belief in two spirit-companions or souls that accompany each mortal from birth till death. (10) A belief in the possibility of capture of one of these spirit-com- panions by malignant spirits. (11) A universal and constant faith in the existence of an after-world and of the survival of at least one spirit-companion therein. (12) A belief in dreams as being often indicative of future evil. (13) A belief in secret methods that may be productive of harm to others. (14) The recourse to oaths and ordeals for the enforcement of promises and for the determination of guilt. (15) The unmistakable apotheosis of bravery as illustrated by the war- like character of one class of deities. The peculiar fear, entertained by the lowly votary, for lonely mountains, odd-shaped rocks, gloomy caves and holes, hot springs and similar formations of nature, his belief that planted things have "Souls" and his peculiar respect for animals and insects -these and minor manifestations may point perhaps to a former nature and animal worship, but at present there is no indication of such. The Manobo's conduct in the presence of such objects and phenomena is one of fear toward, and placation of, the agencies which, he believes, produce the phenomena or of the spirit-owners of the objects that come across his path. It is to them alone that he pays his respect, and not to the material object or manifestation that has become the object of his perception. Though one of the characteristics of Manobo religion is the apotheosis of bravery, as is apparent from the warlike character of the divinities, and from the general desire to die the death of the slain, yet I find no trace of ancestor worship. The dead are feared, their burial-place is shunned, their character is deemed perfidious, and relations with them are terminated by a farewell mortuary feast after which it is expected that they will depart, to vex the living no more.</page><page sequence="28">594 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 29, 1927 MENTAL AND MORAL CHARACTERISTICS The Manobo intellectual attainments are very limited. He counts on his fingers and on his toes, or by means of material objects such as grains of corn. He has no system of writing and does not know how to read. His "letters" and his "contracts" are material objects in the shape of bolos and other things, sent from one person to another with an oral message, or strips of rattan with knots. His method of counting is decimal, and comprehends all numbers up to a hundred, though I am inclined to think that this last number represents infinity to him. The reckoning of time is equally simple. The day is divided into day and night, the hour being indicated by stretching out the arm and open hand in the direction of that part of the sky where the sun or the moon would be at the time it is desired to indicate. The month is not divided into weeks but the lunar month itself is carefully followed, each phase of the moon having its distinct name, though it is only in the case of the plenitude of each phase that they agree on its name. Years are reckoned by the recurrence of the rice-haryesting season, which varies according to the climate and geographical posi- tion of different regions. It is seldom that anyone can count back- wards more than four or five years unless he can help his memory by some event such as an earthquake, an extra" heavy flood, the arrival of the Spanish missionaries, the Philippine insurrection, or the growth of trees, but as a rule no attempt is made to deter- mine the number of years that have elapsed since any event. I have seldom met a Manobo who had any idea as to his age, or any ability to judge approximately of the age of another. Historical knowledge is confined almost entirely to events that have occurred within one's lifetime. There are few traditions that have any historical value, and even in these there is an element of the wonderful that makes them unreliable as guides. It is obvious that the pagan Manobo has made no advance along academic lines, due to the fact that he never has had an opportunity afforded him, but judging of his intellectual ability by that of the Christianized Manobo it is not inferior to that of the Bisaya. I had experience in organizing and conducting schools</page><page sequence="29">GARVAN] CULTURE OF MANOBO OF EASTERN MINDANAO 595 among the conquistas, and it has been my experience that, ceteris paribus, they advance as rapidly as Bisaya. If the conquistas have not progressed as far intellectually, it is due to lack of facilities and not to any inherent inability to learn. Knowledge of astronomy is limited among the Manobo to the names of a few of the principal stars and constellations. The nature of the stars, moon, sun, eclipses and kindred phenomena are all explained in mythological tales, from a belief in which no amount of reasoning can move them. The old story that the comet is the harbinger or bearer of diseases is in vogue. Arts, such as painting and architecture, are unknown, though Manobo can carve rude and often fantastic wooden images, and make crude tracings and incisions on lime tubes and baskets. Notwithstanding their lack of scientific and aesthetic knowl- edge, their observation of nature is marvelous. This is obviously due to long familiarity with the forest, the streams, and the mountains. From his boyhood years the Manobo has lived the life of the forest. He has scanned the trees for birds and monkeys, the streams for fish. Living, as he generally has, within a definite district, and roaming over it in search of game and other things to eat, at the same time keeping a close watch for any variation that might indicate the presence of an outsider, he has come to possess those marvelous powers of sight and of observation that would astonish the average white man. Within his own district the position of every tree is known. Every stream and every part of it, every mountain, every part of the forest is known and has its appropriate name. The position of a place is explained in a few words to a fellow tribesman and is understood by the latter. Trees and plants are recognized, and their adaptation, in a great many cases, for certain economic uses is known, though I think that in his knowledge of the latter the Manobo is inferior to both the Bisaya and the Mandaya, as he is undoubtedly of a more conservative and less enterprising disposition. The Manobo character has been so vilified by missionaries, and by all the Bisaya who have dealings with them, that it de- serves a clearance from the aspersions that have been cast upon it. In dealing with the Manobo, as with all primitive peoples, the</page><page sequence="30">596 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 29, 1927 personal equation brings out more than anything else the qualities that underlie character. Several of the missionaries seem not to have distinguished between the pagan and the man. To them the pagan was the incarnation of all that is vile, a creature whose every act was dictated by the devil. The Bisaya regarded him somewhat in the same light, but went further. He looked upon him as his enemy because of the many acts of re- tribution, even though retribution was merited, that had been committed by the Manobo or by his ancestors. He entertained a feeling of chagrin and disappointment that this primitive man was unwilling to become an absolute tool in his hands for thorough exploitation. Hence no name, however vile, was too bad for the poor forest-dweller who refused to settle near his plantation and toil-man, woman, and child-for an utterly inadequate wage. His feelings toward the conquistas, is little, if at all better. Upon first acquaintance the Manobo is timid and suspicious. This is due to the extreme cautiousness that teaches him to guard a life that among his own people has only a nominal value. When in the presence of strangers for the first time, he remembers that reprisals have been bandied from time immemorial between his people on the one hand, and Bisaya on the other, and he realizes that without proper care, reprisals might be made on him. Again, if the visitor has penetrated into his district, his suspicion may be aroused to its full force by calumnious reports or rumors that may have preceded the visitor's arrival. My own visits were frequently preceded by rumors to the effect that I had magic power to poison or to do other things equally harmful; that I was a soldier in disguise, or by other similar reports. But in these eases and all others one may allay the timorousness and suspicion of these primitive people, to a great extent, by previous announce- ment of one's visit and intentions and upon arrival in their settle- ment, by refraining from any act or word that might betray one's curiosity. Surprise must not be expressed at anything that takes place. The mere question as to what, for instance, is beyond such and such a mountain or where are the head-waters of such and such a stream, may start up the full flame of suspicion. Hence prudence, a kind, quiet but alert manner, a good reputation from</page><page sequence="31">GARVAN] CULTURE OF MANOBO OF EASTERN MINDANAO 597 the last visited locality, and a distribution of trifling gifts is always efficacious in removing that feeling of distrust which these primi- tive people feel towards a stranger. Another charge is that they are revengeful. They certainly believe in "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth." Revenge for an unatoned wrong is a stern fundamental, eternal law, sanctioned by Manobo institutions, social, political, and religious; one that is consecreted by the breath of the dying and passed on from generation to generation to be fulfilled; but it has one saving clause, arbitration. Hence a stranger must inform himself of such past happenings as might jeopardize him. The Manobo has a very limited conception of the extent of the outside world and of the number of its inhabitants, and he is inclined to believe that one American, for instance, knows every other one and may be related by blood to any other. Hence any imprudent action on the part of one may draw down revenge on the head of another,3 relative or not, for even innocent third parties may, by Manobo custom, be sacrificed to the unsatisfied spirit of revenge. The danger, however, in which a stranger might find himself from this cause, is easily eliminated by questioning the people as to who had wronged them on previous occasions; and should he learn that he is considered a party to the wrong through identity of blood or of race with the guilty one, he must gently suggest a plan for arbi- tration at some later date, and in other pacific ways, avert the revenge from himself. It is, moreover, affirmed that Manobo are treacherous. If by treachery is meant a violation of faith and confidence, they cannot be said to be treacherous. They kill when they feel that they are wronged. I know of few cases where they did not openly avow their feelings and demand reparation. Refusal to make the reparation demanded is equivalent to a declaration of war, and in war all is fair. It is every man's duty to safeguard himself as best he can. The Manobo, Mandaya, Mangguangan and Dibabaon houses erected in strategic positions throughout the interior of 3 It is almost certain that the death of Mr. H. M. Ickis, geologist, of the Bureau of Science, Manila, was partly due to the capture and exile of one Gubat of the upper Umtiam some 15 or 20 years ago.</page><page sequence="32">598 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 29, 1927 eastern Mindanao bear witness to the fact that these people recognize the principle that all is fair in war. The fact that they frequently carry their spears and shields when on the trail, and in time of trouble accompany their womenfolk to the farms and guard them there, is sufficient evidence of the fact that every means must be taken to safeguard one's self and interests from an enemy. But let a case be once arbitrated, and beeswax burned or other solemn manifestation of agreement be made, and it is my opinion that the pledge will not be broken. Cowardice is a trait attributed to Manobo and other people of Mindanao. It is true that they do not take inordinate risks. The favorite hour for attack on an enemy's house is dawn. They perfer to thrust a spear through the floor rather than to call the enemy out to fight a hand-to-hand battle. In other cases they prefer to ambush him on the trail, five or ten men against one. Again, it may be more convenient to pick off a lone woman in a camote patch. Such are recognized methods of warfare. Once aroused, however, the Manobo will fight, and fight to a finish. Throughout the Jesuit letters we find mentioned various instances of really brave deeds on the part of the Manobo. In some cases the husband killed his family and then himself rather than fall into the hands of the Spanish troops. I have been informed of hundreds of instances in which the male members of the attacked party threw themselves against superior numbers in order that their wives might escape. Hand-to-hand encounters are not uncommon, if I may believe the endless stories that have been narrated to me by warriors throughout eastern Mindanao. Laziness and dilatoriness can certainly be predicated of Manobo men, but such qualities are to be attributed to lack of incentive to work and to hurry. All the household duties fall by custom upon the shoulders of the women, so that there is little left for the men except to fish, hunt, trap, trade, and fight. When the men set themselves to clearing the forest or to other manual tasks, it is surprising with what agility, skill, and perseverance they work, though such spells of labor are short-lived. No one has ever uttered a written word against the Manobo sexual morality. It is true that sexual matters are discussed with</page><page sequence="33">GARVANI CULTURE OF MANOBO OF EASTERN MINDANAO 599 the greatest freedom, but the most venial breaches of morality are punished. The greatest modesty is observed in regard to the exposure of the private parts. Gazing at an undressed woman, for instance, at the bathing-place, results in a fine. Unseemly in- sinuations to a woman are visited with a similar punishment, but if such overtures go further, even death may be the penalty. As to temperance and sobriety, the rule is to eat and drink all one can, hence the amount of food and drink consumed depends upon the supply. Sobriety is not a virtue. To lose one's equil- ibrium and sense is to do honor to the host and justice to his generosity. Honesty is certainly a trait of the Manobo character. I do not mean to maintain that there is not occasional pilfering, especially in small things that are considered to be more or less communal in their nature, such as palm-wine while still flowing from the tree, but other kinds of property are perfectly safe. The rare violations of the rule of honesty are punished more or less severely according to the amount of property stolen and according to other considerations. Though respect for another's property is decidedly the rule, yet it is surprising to note with what care everything is counted, tied up, or put away, and how marks of ownership are set up on all occasions. I think, however, that these precautions are due not so much to a fear of pilferers as to a feeling of the instability of conditions in a country that has always been subject to turmoil. Honesty in the payment of debts is one of the most striking characteristics of these people. I have advanced merchandise on credit to people whom I had never met before and the whereabouts of whose houses I did not know except from their own information, and yet, six months or a year later, when I entered their region I had no difficulty in locating them nor collecting from them. So high is their feeling of obligation to pay a debt that even children are sometimes parted with in settlement, but this occurs in ex- treme cases only. Though debts are satisfied conscientiously, yet a certain amount of consideration is expected as to the time and other details of payment, except in some very urgent cases.</page><page sequence="34">600 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 29, 1927 Honesty in other matters, as in the performance of formal agreements, is equally noticeable though I must say that the per- formance may not be as prompt in point of time as we would expect. But it must be remembered, in connection with this last point, that in making an agreement one is presumed to make allowance for a great many impediments, such as evil omens, that do not figure in our system of contracts. Another difference, which applies also to the matter of debt, is that the man who owes a debt must be reminded of his obligation and urged in a gentle way to the performance of it. It occurs in some rare instances that a debtor is under a definite contract as to the exact time for meeting his obligation. In these cases, the creditor may be more insistant upon payment. It is to the credit of the Manobo that he never disowns a debt nor runs away to avoid the payment thereof. It has been said that the Manobo is ungrateful, but I do not think that his gratitude is so rare nor so transitory a virtue as is claimed by those who pretend to know him. It is true that he has no word to express thanks, but he expects the giver to make known his desires and ask for what he wants. This is the reason why he himself is such an inveterate begger. He receives you into his house, feeds you, considers you his friend, and proceeds to make you reciprocate by asking for everything he sees. If he is under any obligation to you, he expects you to ask in a similar manner. If you do not do it, he considers you either apathetic or rich, and hence no reciprocation is forthcoming. Among the Manobo no presents are made except of such trifles as have no value. The Manobo feels that he is at perfect liberty to conceal his real thoughts and to give utterance to such distortions of truth as may not compromise him with others. The penalty for slander is so great that this fault is seldom committed. Hence to get the truth from a Manobo, it is useless as a rule, to question him singly or even in the presence of his friends alone. 'He must be brought face to face with those who hold an adverse opinion or belong to an opposite faction. If this can be done, in a more formal way, as for example, by having a number of principal men attend, it will be so much the easier to obtain the desired in- formation.</page><page sequence="35">GARVAN] CULTURE OF MANOBO OF EASTERN MINDANAO 601 Queries as to trails or the dwelling-places of neighboring Manobos are hardly ever answered truthfully and do more harm than good because they tend to arouse suspicions as to the questioner's motives. Such information is obtained more readily by cultivating the friendship of boys than by consulting the older folks. This tendency to disguise or to distort the truth, though it has its natural basis in a desire for self-protection, give the Manobo a reputation for lack of the straightforwardness and frankness that is so noticeable among the Mandayas even after very short acquaintance. This lack of frankness, coupled with a certain amount of natural shrewdness, makes the truth difficult to dis- cover, unless the suggestion made before be carried out, or unless one is willing to wait till the truth leaks out in private con- versation among the Manobo themselves. One trait of the Manobo that seems hard to understand is love for long discussions. No matter how trifling the matter may be it always becomes the subject of an inordinately long conference even though there are no dissenting parties. Even in such trifles as getting a guide to take me, by well-known trails, to settlements of people with whom I was well acquainted, the inevitable discussion would always take place. A great number of people would assemble. The matter would be discussed at length by every one present without a single interruption, except such exclamations of assent as are continuously uttered whether the speaker's views are acceptable or not. It seems that these and ,more solemn dis- cussions afford the speakers an opportunity to make themselves conspicuous or to display their judgment. I can divine no other reason for these conferences because, in many cases that I have known, the result of the discussion was a foregone conclusion from the beginning. Perhaps such discussions are for the purpose of "making no concessions" or if they must be made, of making them begrudgingly. These conferences are as a rule rather noisy, for though one speaker at a time "has the floor," there are always a number of collateral discussions, that, joined to the invariable household sounds, produce somewhat of a din. Noise, in fact, is a general characteristic of Manobo life, so much so that at times one is</page><page sequence="36">602 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 29, 1927 inclined to be alarmed at the loud yelling and other demonstrations of apparent excitement, even though the occasion for it all may be nothing more than the arrival in the settlement of a visitor with a dead monkey. Harmony and domestic happiness are characteristic of the Manobo family. The Manobo is devoted to his wife, fond of his children, and attached to his relatives, more so than the Mang- gauangan, but much less so than the Bisaya or the Mandaya. He is dearly fond of social gatherings for besides the earthly comforts he gets out of them, they afford him an opportunity to display such wealth, rank, and possessions as he may possess. His invita- tions to neighbors serve to keep him high in their estimation and thereby gather around him a number of friends who will be of service in the hour of trouble. Of the Manobo, as of the other people of Mindanao, too much cannot be said of his hospitality. If he has once overcome his suspicions as to a stranger's motives, he takes him into his house and puts himself to infinite pains to feast him as best he knows how. In Manoboland, one who travels carries no provisions. He drops into the first house and when the meal hour arrives he sits down upon the floor and helps himself without any invitation. It is practically his own house, because for the time being he becomes one of the family. If there happens to be a feast, he partakes without any special invitation and when he is ready to go, he proceeds upon his journey, only to repeat the operation in the next house, for it is customary always to pay at least a short visit to every friendly house on or near the trail. One of the mental traits that has perhaps done more than any- thing else to retard the Manobo in his progress towards a high plane of civilization is his firm adherence to traditional customs. All things must be done as his forefathers did them. Innovations of any kind may displease the deities, may disturb the present course of events, may produce future disturbances. "Let the river flow as it flowed-to the sea" is a refrain that I heard quoted on this subject by Manobo. "Fish that live in the sea do not live in the mountains" is another, and there are many others, all illus- trating that conservatism that tends to keep the Manobo a Manobo and nothing else. He is Christianized but, after going through the</page><page sequence="37">GARVAN] CULTURE OF MANOBO OF EASTERN MINDANAO 603 Christian ritual, he will probably invoke his pagan divinities. He takes on something new but does not relinquish the old. Hence the difficulty of inducing the Manobo to leave the district of his fore- fathers, and take up his abode in a new place amid unfamiliar spirits. This feature of their character explains the inconstancy and fickleness exhibited by the Christianized Manobo at the beginning of their conversion. They were due to the call of the forest hailing them back to their old haunts. These characteristics will explain also a host of anomalies that are noticeable throughout the Manobo's life. The first visit of a stranger to a primitive settlement may produce upon him a very unfavorable impression. He may find that the women and children have fled, so that he finds himself surrounded by men, all armed. This should not discourage him as it happens in many cases that the men are unable to keep the women from flight. The wearing of arms is as much a custom with Manobo as the wearing of a watch is with us. The bolo is his life and his livelihood. Were he not to wear it he would be branded as insane, and be looked upon as a defenseless person. Upon first acquaintance the Manobo will ask a host of ques- tions that tax the patience of the visitor if he ventures to answer them personally. These questions spring from a desire to learn the motive of the visit. People from the neighboring houses drop in at intervals just as soon as word reaches them of the new arrival, and may continue to do so until the time of the visitor's departure, thereby keeping the house crowded. The assembling of these people arises from a desire to see the visitor and to find out the object of his visit. They will proceed to ask him every imaginable question that may suggest itself and if an answer conveys in- formation that has anything of the wonderful in it for them, it gives rise to a thousand and one other questions. Another phase of the visit is the frank demand on the part of the primitive people for any object of the visitor which they may take a fancy to. They always understand, however, a quiet re- fusal, if it is accompanied by an appropriate reason.</page><page sequence="38">604 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 29, 1927 It happens sometimes that the chief of the settlement will claim a fee for transgression upon his territory, but he will usually accept a small present in lieu thereof, or will forego any gift, if the matter is argued quietly and diplomatically. The Manobo resents harsh words, especially when used towards him in the presence of his nominal subjects. Personalities or threats in such cases often prove fatal. It is not good etiquette to ask a Manobo his name, especially if he is a chief, until one has acquired somewhat of an acquaintance with him. The information must be secured from a third party and in a quiet way. Moreover, it is customary to address chiefs and other persons of distinction by the names of their corresponding titles. Thus a warrior-chief is addressed bagani, and not by his proper name. It is needless to say that no familiarity should be taken with the person of another until acquaintance has been cultivated far enough to permit it. Thus touching another on the arm to call his attention to something may be resented and may result in an attempt to collect a fine. The handling of arms requires a word. The lance must be stuck in the ground, head up, at the foot of the house ladder; or if it must be brought into the house, as at night, the owner must take care that it points at no one while being handled. If one desires to draw a bolo from beneath its sheath, he must draw it slowly, and if it is to be presented to another, the blade must be kept facing the owner's body and the handle presented to the other man. The same rule holds for the dagger. It will be noticed that as a general rule the men in a Manobo settlement go armed and keep their hands on their weapons, especially during meal-time, at which time it is customary to eat with the left hand, the right hand being reserved for the use of the weapon in an emergency.</page></plain_text>
