<plain_text><page sequence="1">American Philosophical Quarterly Volume 23, Number 4, October 1986 OMNISCIENCE-IMMUTABILITY ARGUMENTS Richard M. Gale HPRADITIONAL theism holds that God is essen ^ tially both omniscient and immutable, or more precisely: (1) God essentially knows all and believes only true propositions. (2) God essentially does not change from one time to another in respect to any non-relational property. Here a non-relational property is one which an indi? vidual could possess even if there were not to exist any other non-universal particulars, save for spaces and times. This restriction allows God to undergo so-called "Cambridge changes," e.g. being thought about by Jones at tx but not t2. Since theism forms the basis of the great historically-based religions of the West, it also accepts (3) There are true temporal indexical propositions (A propositions) to the effect that certain events and/or times are now past, present, or future. It is such A-facts that give these religions their dramatic urgency?that the world was created in the past, has reached a certain stage in its spiritual development at present, and awaits a future day of judgment. It is the purpose of this paper to evaluate various arguments that attempt to deduce from (1) (3), in conjunction with additional necessary prop? ositions, a contradiction. The manner in which one of these omniscience immutability arguments proceeds at this point depends upon whether it is being deployed against the timeless or omnitemporal God of theism. There are two radically different ways in which theism has understood God's eternality. According to one tradition, that includes Boethius, Augustine, Aquinas and Anselm, God is timeless in that He neither endures in nor occupies time, and thereby does not qualify as a subject of any temporal deter? mination or distinction. According to the other trad? ition, which derives from the Bible and is supported by Hegel, numerous post-Hegelians, and contem porary existential theologians, God is omnitem poral in that He both exists throughout a beginning less and endless time and logically cannot begin or cease to exist. When the argument is deployed against the time? less God it argues that it is conceptually impossible that a timeless being know an A-proposition, and, therefore, since God is timeless, there are true prop? ositions that He fails to know, resulting in God both being and not being omniscient. The omnitem poral version, in contrast, argues that necessarily a being who knows every true A-proposition has to keep changing his beliefs so as quite literally to remain up to date. But for God to change in this way is inconsistent with His immutability, a con? tradiction again resulting. Each of these arguments will be considered in turn, beginning with the time? less version. The crucial step in this reductio is its claim that (4) It is conceptually impossible for a timeless being to know an A-proposition. This needs justification, especially since it often has been denied. The first thing that must be done toward this end is to clarify the very troublesome notion of an A proposition. An A-proposition is expressible by (but not necessarily only by) the use or intentional tokening of an A-sentence, i.e. a sentence which is such that successive tokenings of it by the same person, at the same place, and with the same meaning logically could express propositions that differ in truth-value. The meaning of an A-sentence is given by its "Tokening Rule," which specifies the conditions under which an intentional tokening or use of it expresses a true proposition, e.g. the intentional tokening of "Event E is now present (past, future)" expresses a true proposition if and only if it is simultaneous with (later than, earlier than) event E.1 Care has been taken to give only a sufficient condition for an A-proposition, thereby 319</page><page sequence="2">320 AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY leaving it open whether an A-proposition also is expressible by the use of a B-sentence, i.e. a freely repeatable sentence that reports a temporal relation between two events and/or times. Since the propo? sitions expressed by B-sentences?B-proposi tions?can be known timelessly, this avoids beg? ging the question against a common rebuttal of this omniscience-immutability argument, viz. every A proposition is identical with some B-proposition? the B-reduction?and, thus, by timelessly knowing every true B-proposition, God also timelessly knows every true A-proposition. Given this account of an A-proposition, why should we accept (4)'s contention that only a being in time can know an A-proposition? A. N. Prior has given arguments for (4).2 He gives both a nega? tive and positive defense of (4). The former consists in an argument against the chief ground for denying (4)?the B-reduction. Since, as we shall see when we consider Casta?eda's rebuttal based on a time? less way of knowing an A-proposition in oratio obliqua, there are other grounds for denying (4) than that supplied by the B-reduction, Prior's nega? tive defense suffers from incompleteness. We will consider it anyway and then go on to criticize his positive argument for (4). Against the B-reduction's claim that every A proposition is identical with some B-proposition, Prior repeats his earlier objection from his paper, "Thank Goodness That's Over."3 When we say of some particularly unpleasant experience?the final examinations?"Thank goodness that the final examinations are over (past)" we are not expressing the same proposition as we would by saying "Thank goodness that the final examinations occur (italics indicate that the verb or copula is in the timeless present) at t7 (or are 2000 years later than the birth of Christ)"; for why should we be glad about the latter. In brief, Prior's argument is that the A- and B-propositions in question are not identical, since one could be glad about the former but not the latter. Prior's point can be generalized to all prop ositional attitudes, since one could believe, know, etc. that the final examinations are now past without having the same propositional attitude to the B proposition that these exams occur at t7. Herein Prior is implicitly appealing to (at least the only-if part of) the following propositional attitude-based criterion for propositional identity: (PA) Proposition p is identical with proposition q if and only if it is not possible that someone who under? stands both p and q have a propositional attitude at some time T toward one of them that she does not have toward the other. A similar type of propositional attitude-based criterion can be given for determining when two sentences express the same proposition. (PA') The sentences "s" and "s/' express the same proposition at some time T if and only if it is not possible that someone who understands the meaning of both 'V and "s/' have a different propositional attitude at T toward what "s" expresses than toward what "sx" expresses. "at some time T9 was inserted in both (PA) and (PA') so as to make them applicable to A-proposi tions and A-sentences. These criteria could aptly be called the "Fregean Criteria," since it was Frege who stressed the cru? cial role that propositions play as objects of prop? ositional attitudes. These criteria are the most demanding ones and will play a key role when we examine versions of the B-reduction that have appeared subsequently to Prior's criticism of the B-reduction. But even if Prior's negative defense of (4) is not completely convincing because it fails to consider these new versions of the B-reduction, as well as Casta?eda's oratio obliqua way of denying (4), his positive defense of (4) could be completely satisfactory, and we now turn to it. In support of (4) Prior claimed that an A-propo? sition "isn't something that He (God) or anyone else could know timelessly, because it just isn't true timelessly."4 Herein Prior employs the Aris? totelian-scholastic-Lukasiewicz terminology according to which an A-sentence expresses the same proposition whenever it is tokened, albeit one that changes in truth-value. When this argument is reformulated in my above terminology for A-sen? tences, which makes no such assumption,5 it comes to this: (4a) For every A-sentence there are at least two times such that this sentence expresses propositions which differ in truth-value when tokened at these times.6 Prior is here attempting to deduce (4) from the</page><page sequence="3">OMNISCIENCE-IMMUTABILITY ARGUMENTS 321 mere definition of an "A-sentence," and I am unable to see how (4) follows from this definition.7 That more must be said in defense of (4) than that supplied by (4a) is also evident by the fact that no less a philosopher than Peter Geach, in his Pro? vidence and Evil, no doubt with Prior in mind, flatly denied (4), and moreover did so without accepting either the B-reduction (which he opposes) or the possibility of timelessly knowing an A-prop? osition in oratio obliqua. In other words, Geach claims that God can timelessly know an A-propo? sition in oratio recta, even though no A-proposition is identical with any B-proposition. Geach begins by giving the following simple rule for God's omniscience: "'God knows that /?' is true if and only if the plain '/?' is true."8 He goes on to say: We need not lose our heads in dealing with tensed propositions; we need only stick to he simple rule I have just given. In 1939 it was true to say 'Hitler is alive'; it was therefore true to say in 1939 'God knows that Hitler is alive'. In 1970 it was true to say 'Hitler is dead'; it was therefore true to say in 1970 'God knows that Hitler is dead'.9 Notice that no temporal qualification is made on when God knows. Whatever He knows He knows timelessly. What is temporally qualified is the prop? osition He knows and when we time-bound crea? tures can truly say that God timelessly knows this proposition. There is an ambiguity in Geach's presentation which must be clarified before we can evaluate his position. When I now say "God knows that Hitler is now dead" am I ascribing to God knowledge of the very same A-proposition as the one I express by my present use of "Hitler is now dead"? This question gets down to whether the occurrence of "now" in the oratio obliqua clause expresses God's present tense indexical mode of reference to the present moment as well as my own. As Casta?eda has so ably shown, an indexical word, such as "now," always has the widest scope in a sentence, even if it occurs in an oratio obliqua clause, because it expresses the speaker's own indexical reference.10 The question is whether in cases in which an index? ical word occurs in an oratio obliqua construction attributing a belief, desire, etc., to someone it also expresses this other person's own indexical refer? ence. Casta?eda denies that it does. In many cases it does not, especially those involving personal indexicals. If I say "Jones knows that I am tired" the occurrence of "I" expresses my own first per? sonal indexical reference, not also Jones's. For were Jones to have employed this mode of indexical reference, he would have referred to himself rather than me. In this case, the oratio obliqua clause abstracts from how Jones refers to me and thereby underdetermines the proposition known by Jones. But the issue is not so clear cut with "now." Ordi? nary usage, in my opinion, is not sufficiently pre? cise to determine whether an occurrence of "now" in an oratio obliqua clause attributing a belief, etc. to a person does or does not indicate this person's indexical reference as well as the speaker's. If we take such an occurrence of "now" as expres? sing only the speaker's indexical reference, we abstract from how the person in question refers to the present moment and thereby underdetermine the proposition he believes, etc. On this construal, Geach would have failed to show that God can know an A-proposition; for it could be true that God knows that Hitler is now dead without God making a present tense indexical reference to the present moment and thus without God knowing any A-proposition. In this case we underdetermine the proposition known by God. We can, of course, simply decide to construe an oratio obliqua occurrence of "now" or any inde? xical word as expressing both the speaker's and the believer's indexical reference; and we could adopt the convention that when and only when an oratio obliqua construction is represented in the explicit paratactic manner are we so to construe it. If I say "God knows that (this): Hitler is now dead," the oratio obliqua occurrence of "now" expresses both my and God's indexical reference; and, thereby, I do attribute to God knowledge of the very same A-proposition as I express by my use of "Hitler is now dead." This is how we must construe Geach's example. Thus, Geach winds up with the seemingly bizarre position that God is able to make a present tense indexical reference to the present moment without doing so at any time.11 But many a bizarre claim is true, and thus it behooves us to find some cogent argument against Geach.</page><page sequence="4">322 AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Such an argument is to be found in Robert Coburn's version of the omniscience-immutability argument. If a being is omniscient, then presumably it follows that this being knows everything which (logically) can be known. But it is easy to see that an eternal being could not know everything which (logically) can be known, and this is because some of the facts which (logically) can be known, are knowable only by tem? poral beings, by beings who occupy some position (or some positions) in time...assume that the idea of a non-temporal knower makes sense. Then ask, could such a knower know, e.g., that today is May 12, 1962? The obvious answer, I submit, is that it could only if it could use temporal indictor words. For other? wise, it could not express and a fortiori could not entertain a truth such as the above. But a necessary condition of being able to use temporal indicator words is being an occupant of time. Hence, God's alleged eternity is logically incompatible with his alleged omniscience.12 Before we can properly understand and criticize this argument, it must be given an explicit mount? ing. In the following Coburn's "use of an indicator word" is replaced by "tokening of an A-sentence" in which the tokening is intentional. Further, each of its premises is a necessary conceptual truth, as is required, since the conclusion (4) is a necessary conceptual truth. (4b) A person can know a proposition only if she can truly express it. (4c) A person can truly express a proposition only if she can truly token a sentence which expresses this proposition. (4d) A person can truly express an A-proposition only if she can truly token a sentence which expresses this proposition. (From (4c) by universal instantiation.) (4e) An A-proposition is expressible only by the tokening of an A-sentence. (4f) A person can truly express an A-proposition only if she can truly token an A-sentence. (From (4d) and (4c).) (4g) A person can truly token an A-sentence only at a time. (4h) A person who can truly token an A-sentence exists in time. (From (4g).) Therefore: (4) It is conceptually impossible for a timeless being to know an A-proposition. (From (4b), (4f) and (4h).) This argument is valid, but its premises stand in need of further elucidation and justification. Premise (4b) must not be taken as requiring of someone who knows a proposition that she can give overt expression to it in some public language. (Let us not forget Gunga Din and William James's deaf mute. ) For the sake of argument we can assume the possibility of an in-principle private language and thereby permit our Deity to express His thoughts in His own private Deitese language. To establish (4c) we must begin with the fact that knowing entails believing, which in turn entails having a certain occurrent thought or the disposition to have this thought. While God has counter-factual possibilities?He varies across possible worlds? His essential immutability precludes His changing within any world in which He exists; and, in this sense, He has no dispositional potentialities. As a result, all of His thoughts are occurrent. Now to think something occurrently is to say something to oneself, to express a proposition even if only in one's mind or heart. Here we must appeal to an important thesis championed by Geach and Wilfrid Sellars that such internal sayings are to be under? stood as an analogical extension of the overt use of language. This means that we are to construe a person's saying some proposition to himself as involving a mental tokening of a sentence which has the same meaning or plays the same role as does a sentence by which his thought could be publicly expressed. To summarize: (4c) requires of a knower of a proposition that he either can publicly express it by tokening a suitable sentence or mentally token (or be disposed to token) a sen? tence which has the same meaning as some sentence by which this proposition can be publicly expressed. (4d) is just a substitution instance of the universal proposition (4c) and needs no further comment. (4e), which is a denial of the B-reduction, is not explicitly asserted by Coburn, but plainly it is required for the derivation of (4f). More will be said about (4e) when we consider rebuttals based upon the B-reduction. (4g) is necessary in virtue of the Tokening Rules for A-sentences which specify the sort of temporal relation that must hold between the tokening event and the event reported for a true proposition to be expressed. Because the</page><page sequence="5">OMNISCIENCE-IMMUTABILITY ARGUMENTS 323 tokening must stand in a temporal relation to the event reported the tokening must occur at a time. And this seems to entail (4g), since a person cannot do something at a time without existing at that time. I will defend this reconstructed version of Coburn's argument against a number of possible rebuttals. Hopefully, this will enable us to gain a greater understanding of and justification for its various premises. A. God's timeless tokening ofA-sentences. The theistic doctrine of God's timeless causation of effects in time can be marshalled against premise (4g). All of God's actions occur in a single timeless present which bears no temporal relation to any of the events or times in the created universe. These timeless actions are able to bring about effects at different times. Given the doctrine of God's time? less causation, it is apparent how God can truly express A-propositions by timelessly bringing it about that tokens of A-sentences occur at different times in a way which satisfies the Tokening Rules.13 (This might result in some pretty strange phenomena, e.g. a rainbow that has the sign-design of "Mary is now baking pies.") The major weakness in this response, other than its reliance on the highly suspect notion of timeless causation, is its abuse of the Tokening Rules for A-sentences. These Rules specify what temporal relations must hold between an intentional tokening?one done purposely as the sense of the token on that occasion is thought?and reported event. There must be a temporal coincidence between the thinking (believing, etc.) of the sense or proposition and the tokening. Therefore, these Rules also require that the temporal relations in question obtain between the thinking and the reported event. But this is exactly what cannot happen in God's case. God's occurrent believing and thinking of an A-proposition (remember that He has no dispositional potentialities), unlike the occurrence of the A-sentence token He causes, has no temporal relation to any event, and this results in a failure to satisfy the relevant Tokening Rule. Furthermore, God believes all at once, in a single timeless present, every A-proposition (e.g. that E is now past, present, and future), which hardly satisfies the Tokening Rules.14 There is another path that leads to (4g). It begins with the conceptual truth that a person cannot express a proposition unless he can understand the expression of this proposition by someone, in which the "someone" can be himself. God cannot under? stand the expression of an A-proposition by anyone, including Himself, since to do so He would have to determine the temporal relation between the tokening of the A-sentence and His perceiving it; but His perceivings are not in time at all. At this point, our proponent of the "timeless-cau? sation" rebuttal might take the desperation tack of charging us with being unduly anthropomorphic in requiring the Deity to jump through the same con? ceptual hoops as we mortals do, in particular, of having to satisfy our Tokening Rules if He is to have knowledge of A-propositions. It is sufficient if His occurrent believings of A-propositions stand in some appropriate non-temporal counterpart rela? tions to ordinary temporal ones to the reported events; e.g. that His believings of a present tense A-proposition stand in the Kretzmann-Stump ET simultaneity relation (see footnote 11) to the reported event, which, unlike temporal simul? taneity, is neither transitive nor reflexive. My gut reaction to this move is the same I have to apologia for God permitting evil based on God's goodness being totally different from ordinary human good? ness. The price it pays for avoiding anthropomorphism is dishonesty. B. The B-reduction. This family of rebuttals argue that every A-proposition is identical with some B-proposition, and thus by knowing the latter God also knows the former. The first version of this rebuttal to be considered was developed by Nelson Pike for the expressed purpose of refuting Coburn's argument.15 Pike begins by correctly pointing out that a time? less God, in virtue of His knowledge of B-propo sitions that report a temporal relation between an A-tokening and the event it reports, can know when time-bound persons express true A-propositions. E.g. God can know the B-proposition that Smith's tokening of "? occurs now" is simultaneous with E and thereby know that the A-proposition expressed by Smith is true in virtue of satisfying the relevant Tokening Rule. If Smith should be called upon to justify his A-assertion he would do so by pointing out that it satisfied the relevant</page><page sequence="6">324 AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Tokening Rule, i.e. he would assert this very B proposition. And, furthermore, God also would offer this B-proposition to justify His knowledge of the B-proposition that the A-proposition expressed by Smith is true. And, Pike controver? sially adds, this identity in justification shows that the latter B-proposition that the A-proposition expressed by Smith is true is identical with the A-proposition expressed by Smith. And, in virtue of this identity, God timelessly knows the A-prop? osition expressed by Smith. There are several flaws in this. In general, it is not true that a person cannot know that the propo? sition expressed by another is true without knowing this very proposition. There are at least two cases in which this does not hold. In one case a suitable justification cannot be given; e.g., I can know that the mathematical proposition expressed by some noted mathematician is true but fail to know this proposition because I cannot derive or prove it. A more relevant case is one in which I cannot express the proposition known by the other person, thereby failing to satisfy requirement (4b) for knowledge; e.g. I can know on the basis of reliable eyewitness reports that the first proposition expressed by Smith yesterday is true and yet not know this proposition because I cannot express or specify it. And this is exactly the predicament God seems to be in regarding the A-proposition expressed by Smith: He cannot express it since He cannot truly token an A-sentence. That God can identify but not express this A-proposition is not paradoxical once we realize that there are two different ways of iden? tifying a proposition. In one we use a noun "that" clause which expresses the proposition, i.e. has a sense which is the proposition; e.g. one says "that snow is white." In the other we use a non-specifying singular identifying expression, e.g. "Smith's favorite proposition." What Pike fails to do is to show that God can identify an A-proposition in the specifying manner. Another flaw in the argument from sameness of justificatory responses for two assertions to identity of propositions asserted is the assumption that what is asserted is identical with how it is justified. Pike is right that we justify an assertion of an A-sentence by stating a B-proposition indicating that the relevant Tokening Rule is satisfied, i.e. that the tokening bears the proper temporal relation to the event reported. But obviously the A-proposition asserted is not identical with the justificatory B proposition, since the latter alone entails that a token occurs simultaneous with the reported event. The A-proposition that it is now raining could be true even if no tokens were to occur now. The sentence, "It is now raining even though no tokens occur now," is pragmatically self-refuting in that every tokening of it expresses a contingently false proposition. An interesting new version of a B-reduction can be developed from Kripke's views on rigid desig? nators and a criterion for propositional identity based on the semantics of possible worlds, viz. (PS) The proposition/? is identical with the proposition q if and only if they have the same truth-value in every possible world. Consider any A-proposition, say the one expressed by now tokening "E occurs now." "now," which means the same as "at this time," denotes a moment of time (whatever that might turn out to be). There? fore, there is a true identity proposition, say that t7 is now. Both the indexical word "now" and the proper name %" are rigid designators in that they denote in every counter-factual proposition in which they occur the same individual as they do in the actual world. Therefore, if d is rigid, the proposition expressed by "?/ might not have been d" is necessarily false. Both "now" and "i7" are rigid designators by this test. As a consequence, the proposition expressed by the identity sentence "i7 is now" is necessarily true if true at all. Given that it does express a true proposition, it follows that there is no possible world in which now?this moment of time, viz. t7?is not identical with t7. And, since E occurs now, there is no possible world in which E occurs now but does not occur at t7. Therefore, that E occurs now and that E occurs at t7 have the same truth-value in every possible world, and, thus, by (PS), are identical. The only thing suspect in this B-reduction is its criterion for propositional identity. (PS) is a far weaker criterion than (PA), and the question is which one should be operative in our discussion of God's omniscience. It seems that (PS) not only is in general inadequate, since it yields the counter</page><page sequence="7">OMNISCIENCE-IMMUTABILITY ARGUMENTS 325 intuitive result that there is only one necessary (im? possible) proposition, but demands too little of an omniscient being. God would not be disqualified from being omniscient according to (PS) were He to believe that 2+2=4 but fail to believe that 2+3=5. Thus, (PS) permits God to have a second class sort of omniscience, which is definitely not the sort we expect of the greatest conceivable being. C. The Co-reporting Thesis. That we cannot permit God to have a second-class sort of omnisci? ence also undermines this way out of the Coburn argument. It is based on a far more modest claim than that made by the B-reduction?that for every A-proposition there is some B-proposition which reports one and the same event (rather than is iden? tical with it). The event reported by a proposition is the event referred to by its participial nominali zation. That 5 is Oing reports the event of 5's Oing. Thus, the co-reporting thesis claims that for every A-proposition there is a B-proposition such that their participial nominalizations are co-refer? ring. This seems correct. Consider the A-proposition expressed by now tokening "5 is 4&gt;ing now." As seen above, "now" denotes a moment of time, and thereby there is a true proposition identifying now with a moment of time, say that t7 is now. As a result, the B-propo? sition that S is &lt;E&gt;ing at t7 is co-reporting, since 5"s Oing now is one and the same event as 5's Oing at t7, the reason being that these events involve the same subject instantiating the same property at the same time. While our timeless Deity, for the reasons given by Coburn, cannot know the A-prop? osition that 5 is Oing now He can timelessly know the B-proposition that S is Oing at t7 and thereby know of one and the same event as is reported by the A-proposition. Thus, a timeless God can know of every event, including events such as 5's ?&gt;ing now. But this way out attributes second-class omnisci? ence to God. God, on this account, does know of every event but not under every true description. He knows what is going on now, but He doesn't know of these events that they are occuring now. The co-reporting way out receives a spurious plausibility from an ambiguity in "God knows of 5's Oing now" which exactly parallels the aforementioned ambiguity in "God knows that 5 is Oing now" in regard to whether the oration obliqua occurrence of "now" indicates both the speaker's and God's indexical reference or only the speaker's. Since the co-reporting thesis agrees that it indicates only the speaker's, it must say the same about the occurrence of "now" in "God knows of 5's Oing now." And this gives the game away.16 D. The Elimination Thesis. Yet another possible escape from Coburn's argument is supplied by a radical theory of indexicals that has been developed by John Perry in two articles of unsurpassed clarity and brilliance.17 It is radical because it denies the very existence of the sort of A-propositions whose existence is asserted by premise (3)?that there are true A-propositions. These propositions are sup? posed to resemble non-indexical ones in that both are a complete, unified Fregean sense compounded of the senses of the subject and predicate expres? sions of a sentence that expresses this unified sense. Such a Fregean proposition or "thought," in addi? tion to serving as the sense of this sentence, also serves as its indirect reference (i.e. its direct refer? ence when the sentence occurs in oratio obliqua) and most importantly the object of propositional attitudes. Let us follow Perry and call such propo? sitions "traditional" or "de dicto" propositions. Perry has an argument for the elimination of de dicto A-propositions, as well as other de dicto inde? xical propositions, in favor of what he calls "de re" propositions; and, it will turn out that a timeless God can know these de re propositions. Perry begins by clearly demonstrating that the traditional Fregean theory does not fit indexical propositions. The A-sentence "Now is when E occurs" obviously has the same sense or meaning from one time to another, since the sense or meaning of "now" is invariant over time, although its referent is not. And yet one could believe what this sentence expresses when tokened at one time but not believe what it expresses when tokened at another time. This shows that the sense of this A-sentence cannot be identified with what it is that someone believes who believes the proposition or thought it expresses when tokened at some time. The source of the difficulty is that the predicate of a subject-predicate sentence supplies an incomplete sense (e.g. the sense of "_is when E occurs") which requires a sense-completer supplied by the</page><page sequence="8">326 AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY subject expression so as to form a complete, unified sense, i.e. a de dicto proposition. But the subject of an indexical sentence (and for the sake of simplicity indexical sentences whose subject alone is indexical are to be considered) is not fitted to serve as a sense-completer, for the reason just given. Plainly, if we are to go on believing in the existence of de dicto indexical propositions, we must modify this traditional theory of propositions. The most likely way to do this, and one which Frege himself seemed to pursue, is to continue to hold that indexical words are sense-completers but impute to them a sense of limited access that varies with the context, as opposed to the context invariant senses that other words have. Every time "now" is tokened it has a different sense which is apprehendable only at that time, and similarly for other indexical words. As a result, the proposition or complete, unified sense expressed by a tokening of "Now is when E occurs" at t7 can be apprehended or thought only at t7; and only Jones can grasp or apprehend the proposition she expresses by tokening "I am O". The sense that "now" has at t7 cannot be conveyed by any non-indexical or fully general description, since the replacement of "now" by such a description results, according to PA, in a different proposition being expressed at t7. The notion of a sense that is private or of limited access is anathema to Perry, and thereby he cannot get himself to accept the existence of de dicto in? dexical propositions that involve such a sense. Such a theory of propositions of limited accessibility seems acceptable, even attractive, to some philoso? phers. Its acceptability or attractiveness will depend on other parts of one's metaphysics; if one finds plaus? ible reasons elsewhere for believing in a universe that has, in addition to our common world, myriads of private perspectives, the idea of propositions of limited accessability will fit right in. I have no knockdown argument against such propositions, or the metaphys? ical schemes that find room for them. But I believe only in a common actual world.18 Perry develops his de re theory of indexical prop? ositions so as to avoid countenancing these mys? terious private senses and perspectives. Instead of thinking of the sense of an indexical sentence as the proposition or thought it expresses in some context, he proposes that we think of it as the "role" of the sentence, a role being specified by what we have called a Tokening Rule. And instead of thinking of the proposition expressed by an index? ical sentence in some context (i.e. as tokened by some person, at some time and place, etc.) as a complete, unified sense?an abstract entity com? posed of abstracta?we are to think of it as an ontological mixed bag?a pair comprised of the value or referent of the indexical subject expression in that context and the incomplete sense of its pred? icate.19 This ontological mixed bag is called a "de re" proposition. It is true just in case the value or referent of its indexical subject expression in that context falls under or is an instance of the concept denoted by the incomplete sense of its predicate. E.g. my tokening of "I swim every day" expresses this de re proposition: the pair made up of Richard Gale the man (which is the referent of my use of "I") and the incomplete sense of"_swims every day." And it is true because Richard Gale?the value of "I" in that context?falls under the concept being-someone-who-swims-every-day, which is denoted by the incomplete sense of "_swims every day." The next step is to identify a de re proposition with the information conveyed by the tokening of an indexical sentence in a certain context. He says of the tokening on August 1st, 1976 of "Russia and Canada quarrelled today" that it seems to yield just this information: (i) an incomplete sense, that of 'Russia and Canada quarrelled'; (ii) an object, the day August 1st, 1976. (i) and (ii) do not uniquely determine a thought, but only an equivalence class of thoughts. Belonging to this equivalence class will be just those thoughts obtainable by completing the sense of 'Russia and Canada quarreled' with a sense completer which deter? mines, as reference, August 1st, 1976. I shall call thoughts related in this manner informationally equi? valent.20 Herein we have the key to escaping Coburn's argument. God can timelessly know a B-proposi? tion, e.g. that Russia and Canada quarrel on August 1st, 1976, that is informationally equivalent to the de re A-proposition that is expressed by tokening on August 1st, 1976, "Russia and Canada quar? relled today." And thereby God knows this de re</page><page sequence="9">OMNISCIENCE-IMMUTABILITY ARGUMENTS 327 proposition, i.e. its informational content. If it should be objected that God still does not know the de dicto A-proposition that is expressed by the tokening of this A-sentence on that date, the reply would be that there aren't any such propositions and not even an omniscient being can be required to know what isn't there to be known. While I sympathize with Perry's worry about indexical sense completers of limited access, I believe that he has exaggerated the problems they give rise to and, more seriously, that his own de re theory faces far greater problems. Perry's eliminative claim that de dicto indexical propositions are nothing but de re propositions, unlike the eliminative claim that demons are nothing but hallucinatory experiences, is based on purely conceptual considerations consisting in arguments to the effect that such de dicto proposi? tions give rise to puzzlements and perplexities. While he admits that his argument for their elimi? nation is not "knockdown," a better description of it would be a light jab that misses. His "argument" amounts to little more than an expression of his intuitive bias against "private perspectives." But since many, in fact a majority, of philosophers have accepted such perspectives, the onus would seem to be on Perry to make us unhappy with them by showing the conceptual problems they give rise to. But this he has not done. I now hope to show that we should not run in horror from de dicto indexical propositions of limited access because they are not private in any objectionable way. The first thing to note is that these propositions stand in relations of logical entailment to each other; e.g. that 5 is now O at t7 logically entails, on the assumption that there is a later time t9, that it will be the case at t9 that 5 would have been O two time units prior to then. Let us call sentences that differ only in their personal, spatial or temporal indexical expressions "differently indexed counter? parts"; e.g. "5 was O" and "5 is now O", "I am F" and "He is F." The appropriate tokening of differently indexed counterparts can express diffe? rently indexed counterpart de dicto propositions that are at least logically equivalent if not identical. The propositions expressed respectively by tokening at t7 "5 is now O at i7" and at a later time t9 "5 was &lt;t&gt; at r7" mutually entail each other, on the above assumption that these times exist, just as do the propositions expressed respectively by my tokening of "I am F" and your tokening of "He (pointing to me) is F." Thus, even if it were true that each de dicto indexical proposition is apprehendable or expressible only in a single con? text, we can still apprehend or express in other contexts a differently indexed counterpart proposi? tion that entails this proposition. And this should go a long way to allaying our worries about the "limited accessibility" of de dicto indexical propo? sitions. Furthermore, by appeal to the intuitively plausible principle that if X knows both p and that p entails q then X knows q, it can be shown that any indexical proposition can be known in a dif? ferent context than that in which alone it is expres? sible. For, in general, people know that differently indexed counterpart propositions entail each other. This indirect way of knowing an A-proposition is of no help to a timeless God, since He is unable to express and a fortiori unable to know a diffe? rently indexed counterpart proposition to any A proposition. Perry's worries about indexical words as sense completers also applies to proper names if Kripke is right that they aren't replaceable by a description. Just as we had to settle with something like being now as the current sense of "now" we must accept being-Socrates as the sense of "Socrates," the only difference being that the latter has a context-inde? pendent sense; but the problem posed by senses of limited accessibility, supposedly, has already been solved. Of course, Perry might find being-Socrates just as objectionable as being-now and extend the scope of his de re theory to cover propositions expressed by sentences containing proper names. Not only is the de re elimination theory not prop? erly motivated, it faces serious conceptual problems of its own. It will be argued that the de re theory fails to offer a suitable object for an indexical belief as well as a suitable bearer of a truth-value. According to Perry, when someone believes an indexical proposition the object of belief is not a de dicto proposition but one of his ontological mixed bag de re propositions consisting of an incomplete sense and the object which is the value or referent of the indexical expression in that con? text. This is a variant on Russell's multiple relation</page><page sequence="10">328 AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY theory of judgment, according to which belief is an ordered (rc+l)-tuple relation whose relata are the believer and the number n of objects referred to by the subject(s) and predicate of the sentence expressing his belief: and it faces the same serious problems.21 There has been a standard objection to the mul? tiple relation theory which applies with equal force against the de re theory, viz. that it fails to account for the unity of what is believed, said, etc., since it gives us a mere heap, reported by a laundry list, as the accusative. To say or believe something is not to refer successively to different items. A tip-off that something is amiss surfaces with Perry's misuse of "information" when he tells us that the tokening of "Russia and Canada quarrelled today" on August 1st, 1976 "seems to yield just this infor? mation: (i) an incomplete sense, that of 'Russia and Canada quarrelled'; (ii) an object, the day August 1st, 1976." For,if I were without further ado to present you with Jones the man as I say "the incomplete sense of 4_is a fireman'," I would not be said to have informed you of anything nor to have expressed a belief. Of course, were I to have done this in response to the request "Present me with a man and tell me of an incomplete sense which refers to a concept under which this man falls" I would be informing you of something, because, in effect, I would be saying "Jones (this man here) falls under the concept referred to by the incomplete sense '_is a fireman'." But this blown up platonic proposition, like the proposition that Jones instantiates firemanness, is a de dicto proposition, not one of Perry ' s de re propositions. Because a de re proposition lacks an internal articulation and unity, it is categorically unsuited to be the bearer of a truth-value and thereby also unfit to serve as a relatum in an entailment relation. Were I, without any special stage setting, to present you with the man Jones as I say "is the incomplete sense of '_is a fireman'" it would be concep? tually absurd for you to reply "That's true" for I have not presented you with a suitable subject of a truth-value. And, since a de re proposition categorically cannot have a truth-value it is unable to entail or be entailed by anything. But, as seen above in the discussion of differently indexed coun? terpart propositions, indexical propositions do enter into entailment relations. They also have such rela? tions to non-indexical propositions. The A-propo? sition that 5 is now ?&gt;ing at t7 entails the B-propo? sition that 5 is &lt;I&gt;ing at t7. All of this is rendered anomalous on the de re theory. In defense of Perry's de re theory against the charge that there are conceptual absurdities in taking a de re proposition to be an intentional accusative and the bearer of a truth-value, it could be said that his theory is not supplying us with a paraphrase type of analysis, such that the analysans is categorically substitutable for the analysandum in every context, but with a semantic or truth-con? dition type of analysis.22 It is not claiming that instead of saying "Jones believes that. Here is 42nd Street and Broadway" we could have said "Jones believes that" followed by an acting of pointing to 42nd Street and Broadway as we say "the incom? plete sense of '_is 42nd Street and Broadway'." Rather it is giving us the truth-conditions for Jones ' s indexical belief. If this is all it is doing, the de re theory is a very unperspicuous philosophical theory, since it fails to account for the object of an indexical belief, etc. And since the de dicto theory attempts to explain these things, it is, to that extent, a better theory. E. The Quasi-indicator theory. Casta?eda has developed a theory of "quasi-indicators" or quasi indexicals in a series of articles that represent the best treatment of indexicals by any philosopher,23 and he has put this theory to use in refuting Kretzmann's temporal version of the omniscience immutability argument.24 But since his refutation can easily be extended so as to apply to a timeless version of the argument, it will be considered in this section. For, if it succeeds against the latter, it also succeeds against the former, since anything that can be known timelessly can be known at a time (but possibly not vice-versa). Basically, this rebuttal is directed against premise (4e) of Coburn's argument, because it attempts to show that an A proposition can be expressed by the use of a non-A sentence in oratio obliqua containing a quasi-indi? cator, thereby refuting the claim that an A-propo? sition is expressible only by the tokening of an A-sentence. This refutation is extremely subtle and requires that we first get control over the notion of a quasi-indicator.</page><page sequence="11">OMNISCIENCE-IMMUTABILITY ARGUMENTS 329 Briefly, a quasi-indicator makes an anaphoric reference within an oratio obliqua construction attributing a propositional attitude to someone and indicates what sort of indexical reference this person made. In the sentence "Jones believes that he himself is rich" "he himself," in the first place, makes an anaphoric reference within such an oratio obliqua clause and picks up its reference by falling within the scope of a referring expression ("Jones") outside of the clause. But it is more than your ordinary bound variable or relative pronoun, for it also indicates that Jones's belief is expressed or thought by him through the use of a first-personal indexical reference, such as "I." Had we simply said "Jones believes that he is rich" we would not attribute any such first-personal indexical belief to Jones, since the use of "he" in the oratio obliqua clause would be an indexical one and thereby would express the point of view of the speaker. And this would result in our underdetermining the proposi? tion Jones believes, since we would be leaving undetermined how he referred to the subject of his belief. Now for the controversial part of his theory. Through the use of a quasi-indicator we can express in oratio obliqua the very same proposition as is expressed by someone else through the use of an indexical sentence. If I say "Yesterday Jones said that is it then i7," the occurrence of "then" within the oratio obliqua clause, in addition to making an anaphoric reference to yesterday in virtue of falling within the scope of "yesterday," also indicates that Jones made a present tense indexical reference to that time by tokening a sentence synonymous with "It is now f7" in my language. Through the use of the quasi-indicator "then" I succeed in expressing in oratio obliqua the very same A-proposition that Jones expressed in oratio recta through the tokening of an A-sentence. This doctrine is pressed into service in refuting Kretzmann's contention that an omnitemporal God cannot know at any time the very same A-proposi? tions that He or someone else could express in oratio recta at any other time by the tokening of A-sentences. First, Casta?eda shows how God could express all of these propositions at a single time; for if He can't express them He can't know them. Next, he shows how He can know them at a single time. Kretzmann's somewhat confused claim that First such a being (God) knows that it is now tx (and that it is not now t2) and then it knows that it is now t2 (and that it is not now tx).25 is perspicuously rendered by the use of quasi-indi cators as (5) At tx X knows (tenselessly) that it is (tenselessly) then tx, but not t2, and at t2 later than tx, X knows that it is then t2, but not tx.26 This, in turn, is recast so as to show how at a single time, tx, X can know the very same A-proposition that he knows in oratio recta at t2: (6) Time t2 is later than tx, and at tx X knows both (1) that it is then n tx, but not t2, and (2) that somebody knows (or would know) at t2 that it is (would be) then t2 t2, but not tx.27 in which the quasi-indicators "then^" and "theni2" carry subscripts that indicate which date-name out? side of the oratio obliqua clause binds them. It will be important later to realize that a subscript does not turn the quasi-indicator "then" into a constant but only serves as an aid in locating the constant which binds the subscripted word. Proposition (6) does not by itself show that at tx X knows the very same A-proposition that he or someone else knows at t2 in oratio recta. An addi? tional premise is needed, and Casta?eda finds it in the principle of the transitivity of knowledge: (T) If a sentence of the form 'X knows that a person Y knows that... ' formulates a true statement, then the person X knows the statement formulated by the clause filling the blank.28 He goes on to point out that This principle must be carefully understood: it estab? lishes a sort of transitivity of knowledge, but it does not say anything about detaching expressions of the form T knows that'.29 All that remains to be done is to plug into formula T the relevant parts of 6. This results in (6a) At txX knows...that somebody knows at t2 that it is then t2t2.</page><page sequence="12">330 AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY and has the consequence that at tx X knows the very same A-proposition which someone knows at t2?the one which he would express at t2 by tokening "It is now ?2" Before we evaluate this beautifully foxy refuta? tion, it will be shown that it can and ought to be reformulated so as to apply to a timeless Deity. To see why this ought to be done let us begin with the following objection. Even if your Deity X at every time can know in oratio obliqua the very same A-propositions that are expres? sible in oratio recta by the tokening of A-sentences at other times, it still is the case that He must change the way in which He expresses these A-propositions from one time to another; e.g. at tx he expresses in oratio recta that it is then tXtx but does not do so for the A-proposition that at t2 it is then t2 t2, but he changes at t2 in that He no longer expresses the former A-proposition in oratio recta but must do so in oratio obliqua. And this change in the way God formulates His beliefs compromises His immutability. An easy way out of this problem is supplied by the realization that there is no need to place X (God) at a moment of time in order for X to know an A-proposition in oratio obliqua. To see this we only need to rewrite 6 by substituting "and X timelessly knows" for "and at tx X knows" and make our time-bound knower someone other than X. (6') Time t2 is later than tx, and X timelessly knows both (1) that at tx someone knows (or would know) that it is then tX tx, but not t2, and (2) that somebody knows (or would know) at t2 that it is (would be) then t2 t2, but not tx.30 The reason why we can place our oratio obliqua knower X "outside" of time is that the sentences which express his beliefs (e.g. "at tx someone knows that it is then tX tx"), because they contain quasi-indicators, are freely repeatable B-sentences. And this is the vital nerve in the refutation?that, pace (4e), an A-proposition can be expressed by a B-sentence that contains quasi-indicators. Unfortunately, although (6') helps to avoid the mutability problem, it creates a problem of its own in that it clashes with religious orthodoxy. According to theism God is essentially omniscient, i.e. (7) God is omniscient in every possible world in which He exists. It also is the case for theism that God is free to create finite, time-bound knowers or not to. There? fore, (8) There are possible worlds in which both God and time exist but no finite, time-bound knowers do. But the Castaneda-style solution using (6') saves God's omniscience in a temporal world by making Him into an epistemic Count Dracula who must live off the blood of His time-bound oratio recta knowers of A-propositions, which has the conse? quences that (9) There are no possible worlds in which both God is omniscient and time exists but no finite, time-bound knowers do. From (7) and (9) it follows that (10) It is not the case that there are possible worlds in which both God and time exist but no finite, time bound knowers do. And this flatly contradicts theism's belief in (8). Thus, the choice between employing (6) or (6') in a refutation poses a dilemma, for we wind up either compromising God's immutability or departing from theistic beliefs. But it will turn out that there is an escape from this dilemma, because a (6')-style refutation really does not require that there be finite, time-bound knowers. But first it will be shown that both of these refutations suffer from an additional flaw: the principle of the trans? itivity of knowledge T not only is false but also is misused in these refutations. This principle is subject to the same sort of counter-examples and restrictions as is the above principle that a person cannot know that the prop? osition expressed by another is true without knowing this very proposition. Just as I could know that the proposition expressed by another is true but not know it because I lack a suitable justification for this proposition I can know that another knows this proposition and lack this needed justification. Both principles, furthermore, must be restricted to cases in which the proposition expressed or known by the other person is completely specified, and</page><page sequence="13">OMNISCIENCE-IMMUTABILITY ARGUMENTS 331 this means that both the subject and predicate sense components be specified or expressed. If there is propositional underdetermination within the blank space of T, the following sort of counter-example can be constructed. In the case in which "X knows that Y knows that concerning (or of) the F that it is G" the proposition that y knows is undertermined because we are not told how Y refers to the F\ he could have been ignorant that this individual is the F. And, therefore, it does not follow that X knows the very same proposition that Y does. The relevant part of (6') (and (6)) say "X knows timelessly (knows at tx) that somebody, Y, knows at t2 that it is then t2 t2\ The crucial question is whether this also is a case of propositional under? determination in the final "that"-clause?the one that is inserted in the blank space of T. It could be argued with some plausibility that it is not, because the quasi-indicator "then t2" tells us how Y refers, viz. through the use of a present tense indexical word such as "now." Unfortunately, its final "that" clause?"that it is then t2 t2?does not specify a complete proposition since "then t2" occurs as a free variable, no longer being bound by the occurr? ence of "at it2" outside of the "thaf'-clause. Thus, the relevant parts of (6') (and (6)) are not fit to be plugged into the blank space of T. It might be thought that this problem of failing to specify a complete proposition in the final "thaf' clause is easily solved by moving the "at t2 from outside to inside the final "thaf'-clause, resulting in "X knows timelessly (knows at tx) that some? body, Y, knows that at t2 it is then t2i2." But now it becomes clear that neither Y nor X know any A-proposition at all. The proposition that at t2 it is then t2 t2 is identical with the tautology that t2 is t2, which is a B-proposition since it is expressed by a freely repeatable sentence. Assuming, pace Perry, that there are de dicto A-propositions, that it is now t2, by Leibniz's Law, is not identical with that t2 is t2 (or that at t2 it is then t2 t2) because only the latter has the property of being knowable a priori. God, of course, can timelessly know that t2 is t2 (as well as what is expressed by Mr. Rogers' tautological song, "Only you are you"), but this gives us no reason to think that He can timelessly know that. It is now t2. That He can know these tautologies in oratio recta shows that nothing is gained by making God into an epistemic Dracula who must live off the oratio recta blood of time bound knowers. The response to this might be that the proposition that at t2 it is then t2 t2 cannot be identified with the proposition that t2 is t2, since only the former identifies an A-proposition, viz. the one that is expressible by tokening the A-sentence "It is now t2 at t2. This response has a spurious plausibility because it fails to distinguish between the specifying and non-specifying mode of identifying a proposition. While "that at t2 it is then t2 t2 does identify an A-proposition, it does not do so in a specifying manner, as does the tokening now of "that it is now ?2." As seen above, T requires that a complete specification of a proposition be inserted in its blank space. While "that at t2 it is then t2 t2 does completely specify a proposition, it is the B-proposition that t2 is t2. What is tricky is that it also identifies in a non-specifying manner an A proposition. Thus, the phrase "the proposition that at t2 it is then t2 t2 identifies both an A- and B-proposition but does so in a specifying manner only for the latter. F. The limitations on a perfect being's omnisci? ence. This refutation accepts Coburn's argument for (4) but escapes the contradictory conclusion of the omniscience-immutability argument by rejecting the account of God's omniscience given in premise (2) in favor of a weaker one which not only permits but requires that God not know A propositions. It takes its cue from a well known analysis of God's omnipotence that places a logical restriction on what God can do. (11) God is omnipotent just in case for any proposition that p (or action a) if it is logically possible that God brings it about that p (or does a) then God can bring it about that p (or do action a). The omniscience-analogue to this (except for the replacement of "can bring about" by "actually knows" since omniscience requires actual know? ledge) is: (12) For every proposition that p if it is the case that p and it is logically possible that God know that p, then God actually knows that p.</page><page sequence="14">332 AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY The aim of this refutation is to deduce from (12), in conjunction with other conceptual truths, that it is conceptually impossible for God to know an A-proposition. It begins with the conceptual truth that (13) God is an absolutely perfect being. Then it argues that necessarily (14) An absolutely perfect being is timeless. by appeal to the alleged conceptual necessity that (15) Any temporal being has the possibility of ceasing to exist. Since having even the mere logical possibility of ceasing to exist is an imperfection, it follows that necessarily (16) God (i.e. an absolutely perfect being) is timeless. And by appeal to (4) It is conceptually impossible for a timeless being to know an A-proposition. it deduces the desired conclusion that (17) It is conceptually impossible for God to know an A-proposition. And, since God's type of omniscience logically precludes His knowing an A-proposition, His failure to do so is no stain on His omniscience, anymore than His inability to bring about the log? ically impossible is a limitation on His omnipo? tence. This refutation faces two insuperable difficulties. First, by relativizing God's omniscience to what a perfect being can know and defining a perfect being as one which is timeless (and thereby can't know an A-proposition) it creates a paradox of perfec? tion?that an absolutely perfect being possesses a lesser degree of omniscience than is possessed by some possible non-perfect omniscient being, assuming, as seems reasonable, that a being could possess one of God's omni-properties without pos? sessing every other one. This non-perfect omnis? cient being, provided it is in time, would know more than an absolutely perfect being does, since it would know every proposition known by the latter plus H-propositions. Thus, God winds up with a second-class type of omniscience. Second, its claim that (15) is a conceptual truth is quite dubious, since there is a long-standing trad? ition within Western theism that accepts as mean? ingful the concept of an omnitemporal God, i.e. a God Who both exists throughout a beginningless and endless time and logically cannot begin or cease to exist. That the language-game involving the con? cept of an omnitemporal Deity has been played by so many for so long counts against the claim that 15 is a necessary conceptual truth. Having had little success in rebutting the timeless version of the omniscience-immutability argument, the theist might do well to go with this concept of an omnitemporal God and see if he can do better in refuting the temporal version of this argument, thereby salvaging at least part of the theistic trad? ition. This argument establishes that an omniscient omnitemporal God must continually change in the way in which He expresses A-propositions in oratio recta\ e.g. at tx, but not t2, He tokens (even if only mentally) a sentence synonymous with our "It is now tx" and at t2, but not tx, sl sentence synonymous with "It is now i2." Such changes do not com? promise His omniscience. For His change of mind from one time to another does not result in His holding incompatible beliefs?His believing at one time what He had disbelieved at an earlier one. Furthermore, He knows at every time everything that it is logically possible to know at that time; since at every time He knows both every A-prop? osition truly expressible in oratio recta at that time and for every A-proposition truly expressible in oratio recta only at another time a differently indexed counterpart A-proposition that entails it. The problem, rather, concerns His immutability, since these changes in His mode of oratio recta expression of His beliefs result in His having dif? ferent non-relational properties from one time to another, which violates the requirement for strict immutability specified in premise (2). While the requirement of strict immutability befits a timeless Deity, it being a logical conse? quence of His timelessness, why should the omnitemporal version of theism accept it, rather than some less demanding requirement, say that</page><page sequence="15">OMNISCIENCE-IMMUTABILITY ARGUMENTS 333 God cannot change in His underlying character, nature, and purposes? According to Kretzmann, the great medieval theists were committed to strict immutability because they accepted the platonic argument that since a perfect being is absolutely excellent any change in it would be a deterioration and the Aristotelian argument that since a perfect being is in a state of complete actuality it could not undergo any change. It was the latter argument, he claims, that was decisive for them. Moreover, those such as Aquinas and Ockham who argue against the mutability of a perfect being's knowl? edge would surely agree that the change they are intent on ruling out would not constitute deterioration, since they regularly base their arguments on the inadmissa bility of process in an absolutely perfect being.31 And because anything less than strict immutability clashes with the doctrines of these great medieval theists, Kretzmann rejects the attempt to rebut the temporal version of the omniscience-immutability argument by adopting some weaker version of God's immutability. At this point the defender of the omnitemporal version of theism should take the offense and charge the concept of a timeless personal God of Aquinas, et. al with being an impossible one which, moreover, does not square with the concept of the "religiously available God" that informs the working theism of ordinary believers. A person, in the value-laden forensic sense according to which persons are morally responsible agents who are subject to certain rights, is self-conscious and rational. An adequate analysis of either of these traits, be it of a linguistic or phenomenological sort, establishes the temporality of persons. For starters, it seems obvious that consciousness is a temporally elongated process. This is especially true for the higher sort of consciousness enjoyed by rational, self-conscious beings. The brilliant phenomenological analyses of the temporally "ek static" mode of existence of such beings given by Heidegger and Sartre (and before them James, Bergson, and Husserl) bring out the necessity for a self-conscious being to have retentions of its past which inform its present experience in the forma? tion of future projects. Such a being is always on the make, always running ahead of itself into the future. The concept of a strictly immutable, com? pletely actualized person is one that we do not have. The necessity for a person to endure in time can also be seen from an analysis of what it is to be a rational agent. An agent performs intentional actions so as to bring about some goal or end. But to have a goal or end, the agent must have desires and values. But only a temporally incomplete being can have a desire or intention, since one cannot desire or intend what one already has. The rich man does desire and intend to be rich, but what he desires is the continuation of his richness into the future. And he does not yet have these future wealthy states. An agent, furthermore, is a morally responsible being. But someone can be morally responsible only in a community of other morally responsible agents with whom she interacts.32 A timeless being cannot interact with other agents, since it cannot be causally affected by what they do. It is not an accident that those theists who conceived of God as timeless, although they thought He could timelessly bring about effects in the world, were careful to deny that anything in the world could in turn affect Him. (The petitionary prayer of working theists makes no sense on this view.) This doctrine of one-way interactionism makes God a non-agent, since he is rendered unable to be a member of a community of agents who mutually hold each other morally responsible. And without community there can be no communion, thereby rendering the timeless Deity religiously unavailable. The upshot of this brief analysis of personhood is that it is conceptually impossible for any person, even a deific one, to satisfy premise (2)'s require? ment of strict immutability. And with the demise of premise (2) we can bid farewell to the temporal version of the omniscience-immutability argu? ment.33 University of Pittsburgh Received September 6, 1985</page><page sequence="16">334 AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY NOTES 1.

Philosophy vol 34 (1959), p. 17. 4. "The Formalities of Omniscience," op. cit., p. 415. 5. Nor should it, if we want our terminology to agree with ordinary usage concerning being a same-sayer. If I successively token "It is now t7" I would not be said to have expressed the same proposition on each occasion. Rather, I would have changed my mind in regard to what I believe. Further, if I say at one time "Jones is now seated" and at a later time say "Jones is not now seated," I would not be thought to be denying what I formerly said. 6. Prior's use of "there are" needs to be replaced by "there could be" since if it were always raining, as is possible, then every tokening of "It is now raining" would in fact express a true proposition. 7. There is another argument for 4 in Prior's "The Formalities of Omniscience" in which it is made to appear that the mere fact that a timeless being's knowing cannot be located in time bars it from being omniscient, in fact, from knowing anything at all. He writes on p. 416: "...it seems an extraordinary way of affirming God's omniscience if a person when asked what God knows now, must say 'Nothing', and when asked what He knew yesterday, must again say 'Nothing', and must yet again say 'Nothing' when asked what God will know tomorrow." This cute rhetorical flourish derives its effectiveness from the fact that since most of the time we are not talking about a timeless being we might forget we are doing so on this occasion. Since such a being is extraordinary, it should not surprise us that what we must say about it is extraordinary. 8. Providence and Evil (Cambridge, England: 1977), p. 40. 9. Ibid. 10. See his "'He': A Study in the Logic of Self-consciousness," Ratio, vol. 8 (1966) pp. 130-157; "Indicators and Quasi-indicators," The American Philosophical Quarterly, vol 4 (1967) pp. 85-100; "On the Phenomeno-Logic of the I," in Proceedings of the XTVth International Congress for Philosophy, vol. Ill pp. 160-66; "On the Logic of Attributions of Self Knowledge to Others," The Journal of Philosophy vol. 65 (1968) pp. 439-56; "On the Philosophical Foundations of the Theory of Communication: Reference," Midwestern Studies in Philosophy, vol. II (1977) pp. 165-86; and "Perception, Belief, and the Structure of Physical Objects and Consciousness," Synthese, vol. 35 (1977) pp. 285-351. 11. The same claim is implicit in the attempt by N. Kretzmann and E. Stump (in "Eternity," The Journal of Philosophy, vol 78 (1981) pp. 429-58) to refute the timeless version of the omniscience-immutability argument by appeal to a non-temporal type of simultaneity relation, called "?T-simultaneity," in which God stands to every event in time. In virtue of having this relation to a given event God is able to observe it "as temporally present." (p. 439) He "knows what is actually happening as it is happening." (p. 457) There is the same ambiguity in these claims as in Geach's in regard to how we are to interpret the temporal indexical references within the oratio obliqua construction; and, again, if premise 4 is to be challenged, we must interpret them as expressing both the speaker's and God's indexical reference. 12. "Professor Malcolm on God," Australasian Journal of Philosophy, vol 41 (1963), pp. 155-56. 13. For a helpful account of God's timeless causation see W. E. Mann, "Simplicity and Immutability in God," International Philosophical Quarterly, vol. 23 (1983) pp. 267-76. 14. In cases in which there is a large time-lapse between the A-tokening and its later perception, we often adopt the different convention that the referent of "now" is the time of the perceiving rather than the tokening. But only a being in time can make such a "statement-to-be," since his intentional tokening of the A-sentence must temporally precede its subsequent perception. 15. God and Timelessness (New York: 1970), p. 90ff. 16. The co-reporting thesis is the brainchild of Michelle Beer. See her doctoral dissertation Temporal Indexicals and the B-Theory of Time (University of Pittsburgh: 1981). 17. "Frege on Demonstratives," The Philosophical Review, vol. 86 (1977), pp. 474-97, and "The Problem of the Essential</page><page sequence="17">OMNISCIENCE-IMMUTABILITY ARGUMENTS 335 Indexical," Nous, vol. 13 (1979), pp. 3-21. 18. "The Problem of the Essential Indexical," op. cit., p. 16. 19. For relational sentences with more than one indexical subject expression, e.g. "This hit that," the de re proposition expressed in some context will be an ordered ?-tuple comprised of a sequence of the different values of its indexical words in that context and the incomplete sense of its relational predicate. 20. "Frege on Demonstratives," op. cit., pp. 481-82. 21. For a fuller treatment of these problems see my article on "Propositions, Judgments, Sentences, and Statements," in the Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ed. by P. Edwards (New York: 1967)) pp. 494-505. 22. I owe this reply to Paul Coppock. 23. See articles listed in footnote 10. 24. He does this in "Omniscience and Indexical Reference," The Journal of Philosophy vol. 64 (1967) pp. 203-10. Kretzmann's article "Omniscience and Immutability" appeared in the same journal one year earlier. Both articles have been reprinted in the B. Brody anthology Readings in the Philosophy of Religion, op. cit., and all future references are to the pagination in this book. 25. Kretzmann, op. cit., p. 366. 26. Casta?eda, op. cit., p. 378. I have changed Casta?eda's numeral-name for this proposition from (4a) to 5 so as to fit the format of my paper and similarly for his other numbered propositions. 27. Ibid., p. 381. In what follows the qualification "(or would know)" will be dropped, since, as will be seen, it is not needed. 28. Ibid. 29. Ibid. 30. In correspondence Hector Casta?eda has expressed his whole-hearted approval of this amendment, since it was his intention all along to refute the timeless version of the omniscience-immutability argument. 31. Kretzmann, op. cit., p. 375. Kretzmann rightly finds the platonic argument to be unacceptable. 32. They must play what I call "The Moral Responsibility Game" in my article "William James and the Ethics of Belief," The American Philosophical Quarterly, vol. 14 (1977), pp. 1-14. A full account and defense is given in this article. 33. I wish to thank the following people for their helpful remarks on an earlier draft of this paper: Robert Almeder, Stephen Brody, Joshua Golding, Carl P. Hempel, Norman Kretzmann, William Mann, Gilbert Plumber, Philip Quinn, Jay Rosenberg, Richard Swinburne, and Irving Thalberg.</page></plain_text>
