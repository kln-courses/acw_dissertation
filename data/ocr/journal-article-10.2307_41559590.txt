<plain_text><page sequence="1">Karamat: sacred places and persons in Malaya. By B. 0. Winstedt M.A., D. Litt. (Oxon.) Tlie study of sacred places and persons (karamat) in Malaya has hardly received the attention it deserves. Besearch in this, field throws light not only on the nature-worship and ancestor- worship of the primitive Malays but also on that facile canonization of Muslim saints living and dead that marks the Indian source from which Islam came originally to the Peninsula. The traditions as to the fifty one sacred places and persons, recorded here have led to a classification of karamat under several heads: (1) natural objects such as rocks, hilltops, capes, whirl- pools and so on; (2) sacred tigers and crocodiles;, (3) graves of magicians; (4) graves of the founders of settlements; (5) graves of Muslim saints, and (6) living Muslim saints. In my second, example a dead Sayid has been dragged in of recent years to hallow the nature-worship centring round Pulau Aur. Muslim jins are often used for the same object: - examples (4), (6) and (8). Syncretism has made the kernel of many traditions hard to dis- cover. Living saints often bear the hallmark of some physical peculiarity: one has a hairy uvula, another is a dwarf, another is short-sighted, another has half his tongue black. All have mysterious powers and some can perform miracles. One mark of a dead saint is the saffron-like fairness of his corpse: another the mysterious separation of the head and foot stones of his grave^ The traditions here collected contain many details of interest to the student of primitive religion and magic and it is to be hoped that other enquirers may add to these records of the karamat of Malaya. Further material is to be found in W. W. Skeaťs " Malay- Magic ", pages 61-71, 153, 163-165, 283. Natural objects - rocks, hill-tops, capes, whirlpool. (1) In the Perak river near a deserted village, Labit, and opposite Mount Berembun stands a large isolated rock, above a rapid known as the Baťs Elbow. The rock is called Gaffer Idol (TV Berhala). From Labit to Mt. Berembun is stretched a magic- branch that lies at the bottom of the Pérák river and rises, mottled and mossy, to the surface only when the Gaffer wants to use it as a bridge to his rock in midstream. For Gaffer Idol and his wife Embun originally were mortals. One day the wife went to this huge rock to bathe and vanished, carried off by the ghosts of her ancestors. Her husband bewailed her fate and she came and.</page><page sequence="2">1924] WinsŤedt : Karamat. 265 carried him off too. The Gaffer used to keep a pair of sambhur deer and a pair of barking deer (each with gold neck-chains), a white crocodile, and a white crow: prayer to his sacred rock will render these animals visible at times. Neglected, the Gaffer can cause sickness among settlers and passers-by, and the wrecking of boats in the rapid. If his help is required to heal the sick, the yellow thread, the betel quid and the cooling water to be used as medicine must be laid on his rock for half an hour so that the Gaffer may come invisibly and bless them. Thank-offerings 'also are laid on the rock only for half an hour. Pawangs invoke his aid to recover wreckage. They can find the spot where it lies by casting a handful of rice on the stream where the boat sank, and following the progress of the grain till it revolves: at that place che sunken boat lies. The kernel of this Tcaramat is a rock and the legend that .anthropomorphism has woven round it embraces a sacred hilltop also., Mt. Berembun. (2) In the China Sea is the Island of the Bamboo, Pulaü Aur. Formerly it was only a rock, out of which grew not any plant commonly met in salt water but a bamboo with two joints. Once the five sons of an Arab Sayid, who had settled at Da'ik, were sailing in search of fortune when the eldest died at sea. His brothers committed him to the waters along with two joints of bamboo, as symbols of grave-stones. At their prayer the rocky islet tiróse. Sailors in want of a favouring wind make offerings of rice and goaťs fiesh, and hang up white and yellow rags on the island. Then if they sail away fasting and with their thoughts fixed on this sacred place they will get fair winds and a prosperous voyage. (3) In the district of Lumut in the Dindings there is a rock lying on a larger rock, which has been a sacred place for fifty years or more. Once there was a pious Patani Malay in the district, -called Dato' Sulong. On several occasions he disappeared and on his return said he had been visiting this Hanging Eock ( Batu Bertenggeh) . One dav he vanished for ever. Later he informed the local pawang in a dream that the Hanging Rock was sacred and that any one guilty of unseemly language or conduct in its neighbourhood would fall sick. A pert boy tested the truth of the tale and suffered from fever and vomiting until his father vowed to offer at the rock seven plates of rice and seven black-skinned fowls. Chinese as well as Malays revere the spot. (4) At the foot of Gunong Mesah near Gopeng in Perak "there is a cave with several hanging rocks. One night the local pawang dreamt that a Muslim jin, bearded and attired in Arab dress, spoke to him, saying that one of the rocks was his dwelling- place and that people should not defile the cave. A sceptical boy tried the experiment and at once got fever. By divination from a candle set on the edge of an ewer of water the pawang discovered the patient had been crossed (Mtëgoran) by a spirit downstream -where the cave was. The patient confessed and was cured by</page><page sequence="3">266 Journal Malayan Branch, Royal Asiatic Society [Yol. II an offering of rice and a black fowl to the jin in the cave. Today- all who pass the place exclaim, " Greetings, grandsire. Your children ask leave to pass. Forgive them for what thay take or brush against, for they have no manners." (5) Once upon a time a pelican was drinking on the brink of the Jelai river at Kuala Lipis, Pahang, when there passed a mythical giant, Sang Kelembai, who changed all. he greeted into» stone. So the pelican was turned into a bird-shaped rock and has given its name to a pool (Luboh Batu Burong). The stone is sacred and rags are hung upon it to this day. In the early days of' British protection a white man tested its sanctity by firing shots at it. It showed no marks or damage. (в) In Elephant Hill ( Gunong Oajah ), near Kuala Dipang; in Kinta, Perak, there is a cave containing rocks and stones which once were people engaged in a feast, when »Sang Gedumbai (= Kelembai) passed and by his greeting petrified them. An: old midwife lived at the edge of the cave. Once she vanished' for a week and returned at last, sallying out of the jungle with a basketful of various foods. She said a Muslim jin had fetched" her to deliver his wife at the top of the hill. There too was a town with shops, where the jin had bought presents for her. He- had told her to appeal to him in trouble when he would visit her in dreams. In later times a local magician reported that the tale was true and that the child delivered had married a mortal. The« sanctity of the hill was confirmed by the fact that the vow of an offering by the parent of a sick child caused its recovery. (7) At Merlimau in Malacca about four miles from the sea there stood a large sacred rock called the Junk ( Batu Jong) until' in 192''0 A. D. the Public Works Department broke it up to make^ the Jasin road. Once upon a time a naughty boy, Ragam, ran away from home till he came to the sea-shore. Seeing a junk pass gay with flags and music he took off his coat and waved. The captain stopped his ship and took the boy to his mistress, the princess of Ledang Island. iS.he brought him up and eventually made him captain of her ship. Some years later, when his crew were ashore, an old shabby woman hearing the name of their captain declared he must be her lost son. When she was taken aboard, Nakhoda Eagam failed to recognize her and disowned her.. Weeping she returned. But the petrified remains of the junk and its anchor, of an elephant that was on board and of the clothes of the crew remained till 1920' as witness to the fate- that overtook the unfilial captain. All this happened when sea . lapped the foot of Gunong Ledang. (8) Near the village of Batu Kikir in the Kuala Pilah district there is a peak like an ant-hill in the Melintang range. It is called Bukit Merbau after a tall шёгЪаи tree that crowns it. Thither a headman once led his people to decide a case between a man, Haji Sa'iran, and his fellow-villagers, who, falsely, the Haji" said, declared that his ne'er-do-well son, Long, the child of his:</page><page sequence="4">1924] Winstedt: Karamat. 26 T old age, was a bastard. Long alone of the party fainted and failed to reach the top. On the summit was discovered a flat stone with a hollow full of water. Its warder is a Muslim jin, called Green Turban, who is accompanied by a were-tiger, Dato' Negun. If any evil is about to overtake or any alien tiger about to enter the district, this ghost tiger roams round it roaring for three nights.. People make vows at this sacred place for recovery from sickness,, for plentiful crops and so on. Formerly incense and invocations would produce magic crockery on the summit for the use of those* believers who lacked plates and dishes for a feast. But borrowers failed to return them or returned cracked ware for good. So this miracle has ceased! (9) On the top of Gunong Eembau are rocks, which onc&amp; upon a time were the palace, the goatpen and the fowl-house of a prince. There also are two ponds, the Footprint pond and the Cooking Pot pond. Many vow to present offerings at this sacred spot in return for riches or good crops. If a request is going to be answered, there will be water in the ponds: if it is going to be refused, the water will at once dry up. A fierce wind will strip stolen clothes off any dishonest person who scales the mountain. Formerly the mountain was an island, where a Pasai prince and his consort, Princess Manila, landed and settled.. Gradually dry land silted around it and the prince's settlement was peopled with aboriginal Malays. The prince retired to live a hermiťs life at Cape Eachado but his consort still lives atop Gunong Eembau, whence in one step she can visit her husband. Some detect at this cape the footprints of this princess, who if invoked will step down from her hill to push off ships ashore on the promontory. Again. At the extremity of Cape Eachado there is a whirl-pool, about a chain square, inhabited by a female Muslim jin, who can cause and cure sickness. (10) There was an old pawang, Nenek Anggam, of Sungai Baharu, Malacca to whom a Muslim saint revealed in a dream that at the confines oí the parish there was a holy spot marked by a tall tree and a great rock bearing the marks of a tigress and her cubs. It lies at the source of the river that irrigates the local rice-fields. It is called Karamat Dato ' Budi and prayers are said there yearly before the rice seed is planted. A gold-mine was once opened in the neighbourhood but the coolies fell sick or were killed by tigers : the Chinese headman dreamt that the spirit of the karamat demanded seven women, primae gravidae, and work- stopped. After the harvest a great feast is held, scraps of the different sorts of food being left as offerings. (11) In Market street, Teluk Anson, stands a tall pulai tree. When two Indian coolies were ordered to fell it, the hacks they made by day closed up by night and they themselves died. Then a Malay pawang dreamt it was a sacred tree, where ghosts and spirits sport, and ever since all races, Malays, Chinese, Indians,, have laid offerings there.</page><page sequence="5">;268 Journal Malayan Branch, Royal Asiatic Society [Vol. II (12) An old couple had seven sons. One day they went to bathe in the Muar river and did not return. Only their clothes were found. But a bearded figure in Arab clothes visited their father in a dream and told him that his sons had been transformed into saints with invisible bodies like fairies and one of them guarded Mensira. Now at that spot is a huge měnsira tree unto this day. Under it are often met a tiger, a crocodile, snakes and scorpions, to kill any one oef which would bring disaster on the parish. People make vows there. Formerly incense and prayer would produce magic plates for those in need, but this miracle has ceased, because, instead of returning the shards of any broken, borrowers replaced them with whole but ordinary plates. (13) A pawang lived on Gunong Berembun in Negri Sembilan. He had seven sons, to whom he taught his magic. Finally he sent them to practice austerities ( běrtapa ) beside a stream. After twice seven days he searched for them. They had disappeared. But a bearded fairy prince {raja orang bunyian) in Arab dress visited him in a dream and told how his sons had become saints. They had all plunged into the stream and the youngest had risen to the surface at Kuala Sungai Dioh. To guard the sacred spot he haunts are four warders: a lame tiger that rules the jungle, a white crocodile and a white snake which rule the water, a white gibbon that rules beasts and men. The white gibbon was once a princess of Pagar Ruyong and was turned into a gibbon for breaking troth with Anggun Che Tunggal! The lame tiger was captured by the saint of Kuala Sungai Dioh from a band of tigers, guardians of the sacred place on Gunong Ledang, who had come to attack the karamat at Kuala Sungai Dioh. Having learnt their purpose in the form of a cat, he went behind a bertam bush and made his body as big as a mountain ; then he chased the tigers so that their rush broke a pass through a hill, still called Bukit Putus; one of them he captured and made a warder of his domain. A Sakai saw all this happen. No pawang will let his people wash mosquito-curtain or curry- stone in a river above a sacred place, because the white crocodile and the white snake once slew a couple who defiled their river and inconvenienced their fish by doing so. The white gibbon was booting at the time. So pawangs say the hoot of the gibbon at midday betokens the death of a man by violence. Offerings are made, incense burnt and trays of food hung on a certain twisted root at Kuala Dioh. If a sick man recovers, he fulfils his vow by offering white and black broth, a black fowl and a portrait of himself made of dough. At the beginning of the planting season a mock combat with calladium sterns takes place there, д buffalo is slaughtered, and a portion of blood and flesh given to each person to take away and plant in the corner of his or her field ■^s an offering to earth spirits. (14) A couple living on Ayer Hitam hill, Penang, had «even virgin daughters. Every day the girls took their goats to</page><page sequence="6">1924] Wilstedt: Karamat 2691 graze till one day three of the girls went astray and took refuge in a cave. The youngest, Che Nah, was lost on the return the following day and her foot became caught in a crevice. An old man found her there but her body had turned to stone. She had become a karamat. Her father prayed to her to relieve his poverty. In a dream she told him to dig at the foot of a tree where he would find gold. A hut has been built over the sacred stone. Malays, Tamils, Indians and Eurasians frequent the place. It is- known as Karamat Che Nah or as Karamat tujoh bèradek. A variant account states that Che Nah died at home but appeared to her sisters in a dream, instructing that her body should not be buried but cast into the jungle. On returning to the spot they found it occupied by their sister in the form of a white tigress. In a dream she warned her sisters that they should remove to Pulau Tikus Kechil, where now there is another famous "karamat . After they had removed, an old man Harun took offerings to the tigress. When he died, the beast disappeared. (15) Between Tambun and Pulai in Kinta there is a rock bearing a mark which has made it a karamat . It is the footprint of a famous medicine-man, Pawang Rej ab. One day he went, as was his custom, to fossick for tin. With him he took his son, whom he warned not to express surprise at what he saw. But when his father started to work, he was so amazed that he cried out, "Why, father, you split rock easily with a twig ( puchok dědap) ! Other folk would find it hard to split with iron."' His father did not hear. So the boy repeated this remark three' times. Straightway the Pawang uttered a loud cry, sprang and slipped along the rock to seize his son by his long lock of hair, whereupon they both vanished. The mark where his foot slipped is still on the sacred rock. Soon afterwards the Pa Wang's wife and property also vanished. (16) The karamat at Paroï between Seremban and Bukit Putus embraces traditions of hills, of a well now filled up but due originally to the footprint of a sacred white elephant, of seven or eight families who founded the village beside the well and of eight Arab missionaries who sailed from Sumatra to Patani and Kedah (wherefore those countries are celebrated for religion to this day), fared then to the top of Bukit Putus (where today there is a hut for folk to pay their vows in) and so down to the sacred well at Paroï. A Malay saw seven of them dive into the well, whence they never rose again: - for they came up at the Seven Hills ( Bukit tujoh) near Sri Menanti, so that all who approach those hills today say " Greetings, Gaffers ! Your grand- child would pass." The eighth Arab stayed on the brink and told the Malay all about himself and his fellows so that the legend might be preserved ! The next morning he too dived into the well and vanished, to become the karamat of Paroï. One account makes him leader of an army of were-tigers. And in Negrf Sembilan any one angry with his cattle utters the imprecation^.</page><page sequence="7">370 Journal Malayan Branch, Boyal Asiatic Society [Vol. II " May the Dato Paroï attack you !" Malays, Hindus and Chinese revere the spot, which in 1922 was visited by H. H. the Yang •di-pertuan. Sacred Tigers and Crocodiles. When Tun Ali (died 1847) ruled Pahang, there lived in Chini lake a huge crocodile called the Luck (seri) of Pahang. He was betrothed but his betrothed was carried off by another crocodile, called the Luck of Cambodia. Transforming himself into a human pilgrim or Haji, the Luck of Pahang took ship to the sea of Cambodia where resuming his proper shape he leapt into the water and sought his rival. His rival took shelter in a rocky cave. Dashing after him the Luck of Pahang hurt himself and so was worsted in the encounter. He returned to Pahang, hanging on to the rudder of a ship but could ascend the river no further than Pasir Panjang near the estuary. A pawang about, to go to Chini lake dreamt that the Luck of Pahang bade him inform the crocodiles there that they must go down to Pasir Panjang to meet their dying lord. All the crocodiles of the Pahang river and its tributaries went down. Tun Ali, ruler of Pahang, also had a dream, in which the Luck of Pahang asked to be shrouded and buried at Pasir Panjang. This his highness did, using 70 rolls of linen. White rags and palm blossoms are hung beside the grave and vows are made to bathe the sick there if in answer to their friends* invocations to the sacred crocodile they regain their health. (18) About 30 years ago a tiger frequented a cave in Gunong Kurau near Kampong Sungai Akar, Perak. He molested no one and over his resting-place in the cave was what looked like curtains of stone. Three nights running one Haji Muhammad Salleh dreamt that this tiger was sacred. And when his child fell ill, he vowed that if the infant recovered he would bathe it at the door of the cave, sacrificing a white goat and burning incense. This he did, unharmed by its inhabitant. Today the tiger is very old and can hardly crawl. But all the villagers believe he is sacred. Graves of Magicians. (19) At Bukit Serudong in Rembau there is the sacred grave of a famous pawang, To* Anggut, to which folk resort for recovery from sickness, for good crops or if any of their relations have been arrested by the myrmidons of the law: - it is guarded by a were-tiger, the familiar of local medicine-men, as once it was the familiar of To' Anggut. This worthy is reputed to have founded the custom of mock combats before clearing the rice- fields. For seven days he visited all homesteads in a procession headed by a spearsman and seven flag-carriers. * On the last day a white and a black goat were sacrificed, and the combat with -calladium stems took place. He also instituted lustration for the</page><page sequence="8">19&amp;4] Wjnstedt: Karamat. 271 sick and tied threads and lead on their wrists. In epidemics Ъе let no one cut down vegetation, or slay beasts for seven days; no one might leave the house of the sick or talk to visitors or strangers. (20) _ At Bagan Tambang, Teluk Ayer Tawar, in Province Wellesley there _ died on the 25th June 1817 a famous Pawang ffitam the son of Haji Abdul-Karim, aged 98 years. One Friday night an adult grandson dreamt that the deceased had become ii karamat. Soon afterwards there was a theft in the village. Diviners failed to trace the stolen goods. Then their owner vowed to offer saffron rice and a white cock at the Pawang's tomb, it he would help to find them. Forthwith the idea came that the goods were buried in the sand at the foot of a certain tall tree. There, to be sure, they were unearthed, the thief not having had time to Temo ve them. Vows at this tomb will also help the sick. (21) About lOO years ago at Kemunting near Taiping there lived an old Achehnese midwife or medicine-woman called To' Bidan Lanjut, to whose grave people of all races resort asking for offspring or health or wealth. Her grave is under a huge tree on which supplicants hang rags or stones. An Indian Muslim is employed by the Chinese miners to look after this holy place. Graves of founders of settlements. (22) Among the founders of Trong in Perak was a famous medicine-man, Johan. Vows are made at his grave, incense burnt there and a curtained frame hung over it. (23) In the parish of Pengkalan Baharu in the Dindings there is a sacred place in the middle of a plain ( Karamat To ' РаДапд), reputed to be the grave of a Bugis prince, Johan. &lt;îangga Shah Johan, (who was worsted by Raja Suran according to the "Malay Annals ") invited Johan to a combat with his son, the winner of which was to wed his niece Princess Puchok Xelumpang. But the defeated prince persuaded his father's Yizier to fence with his Bugis rival, and Johan was slain by a stream (called Alur darah 'the gully of blood ') where the •water still flows red. The grave with an Arabic inscription still stands beside the Bruas river. A were-tiger there keeps off •elephants and grouting pigs ; a crocodile is warder of the adjacent river-bank; a white cock dusts the grave with his wings. Beside it is a tall fig tree ; a Chinaman started to fell it for a planter but was struck with paralysis and did not recover till his comrades laid offerings before the tree. The ancient grave of an unknown man seems to have started this legend. (24) Near the Malay school at Salak N'ama, Rembau, is the sacred grave of Dato' Sri Maharaja (younger brother of Dato' Laut), one of the founders of Rembau. Tradition says that he liad a hairy tongue; whenever he spoke, the hairs fell into his lap ; when he had finished talking, he replaced them in his mouth !</page><page sequence="9">272 Journal Malayan Branch, Boyal Asiatic Society [Yol. II (25) A poor Achínese fisherman having caught nothing visited an island where a saint seated on a white rock gave him a twig which would always attract fish. So he became rich and was called Dato' Pulau, "Island Chief." He left Sumatra for Negri Sembilan where he settled and married at Kampong Glong. Later he founded Pengacheh, where he became famous as a medicine-man. He had two daughters, Kudeh and Machang, the ancestresses of the two divisions of the local Achinese tribe (anale Acheh darat and anale Acheh baroli). The grave of this founder and medicine-man is sacred, the resort of suppliants. The wife of this chief ran away from him, after accidentally burning her bosom in a pan full of hot sugar. She hid by the riverside, where a white crocodile came and licked it and made it well. So to this day the Glong tribe ( sulcu Glong) shroud and bury dead crocodiles. (26) Three brothers, members of the royal house of Pontianak migrated first to Bangka and then in the time of Sultan Husain ( 1800 A. D.) to4a spot on the coast of Singapore harbour. The eldest was named Lasa, the youngest Bujang and the other Lasam. As they were making a clearing, a storm came accompanied by great darkness. So they called the place Siglap ! Immigrants from Eiau and Lingga swelled the population. So, Lasa having returned to Pontianak, the English made Lasam chief (Penghulu) of the place. Once a Bugis, Wak Biak, ran amuck, killing several people. No one could capture him. Lasam arrested him single-handed. The police let him escape and he killed more people. Lasam again captured him. People began to regard their Penghulu as sacred (karamat). Lasam died and the colour of the corpse was like saffron. This confirmed his sanctity and vows are still paid at his grave. (27) Several hundred years ago eight holy men came to Pahang from Minangkabau, including To' Tun Bahau, To' Tun Cheruis, To* Tun Bandan, To' Panglima Mat Kasim. The last settled at Segenting near Kuala Cheka and had four sons, whose sacred graves are at Yong Blit, Yong Kudong, Aur Gading and Kampong Atir. Most sacred of all is the grave of the father, karamat Segenting. On his tomb is a stone, which was the water- vessel ( gopong ) he used for his religious ablutions. Alive he kept two crocodiles, with rattan cords through their noses. These crocodiles appear to persons who fail to fulfil vows at their master's tomb. The great flood of 1885 covered all the surrounding land but not that grave. Goats are slaughtered and white cocks loosed beside the tomb by those whose prayers there have been answered. Graves of Muslim Saints. (28) In former days, the route into Perak was from Brua» to the Hill of the Achinese Grave (thangkat kubor Acheh) in the parish of Blan ja. Once at that Hill there was a large settlement</page><page sequence="10">1924] Minstedt: Karamat. 273 with a mosque. A princess lived there, betrothed to a Bruas trader, Muda Che' Maalim. But another Bruas trader, Che' Idin, came in his absence and forcibly married her. A fight ensued. Che' Maalim entering the mosque in pursuit of fugitives, saw its keeper {siale) behind a pillar and hacked at him, where-upon he vanished mysteriously. The two rival lovers fought and perished. Soon afterwards a man dreamt that IV Siak had become a saint {karamat) and founded an invisible settlement, where the material settlement wasted by fighting had sunk back into the jungle. Later another dream revealed that To' Siak had removed to Changkat Kuala Parah on the Perak river. A tiger and a crocodile guard the place sacred to him. Syncretism has composed this karamat of hills, a founder, a saint and a shadowy tradition of a grave. (29) Thirty years ago a pious Muslim trader, Muhammad Eawi, opened a shop in Gopeng, Perak, and prospered. He went alone to Mecca and on his return was styled Shaikh. Later at his funeral rain fell, though the sun was shining. A grandson of the deceased fell very ill and his parents vowed to bathe him at the Shaikh's tomb if he recovered. At once the child got well and the tomb became a sacred spot where vows are made. (30) Two hundred years ago at Bukit Tersan near Raub lived a very pious man possessed of magical arts. He and his family are buried there in tombs waist-high. The saint is known as Dato' Karamat. The sick make vows to bathe there, hang flags and release a white fowl on the grave if they recover. Those who make vows, at once have white flags hung here as symbols that a vow has been made. Some drink the water from the crevices of the grave-stones. (31) A pious Achinese, To' Pakeh, settled at Nibong Tebal and died there in an odour of sanctity. His grave at Matang Pauh is still honoured. His son, To' Baik, followed his example. One day he went down to the Krian river to get water for his ritual ablutions. A crocodile seized him. But five or six times he rose to the surface, e j aculating, " It is well " ( baik ! ) . Only his left leg was recovered and duly buried near Nibong Tebal. A villager dreamt that the deceased had become a saint {karamat). The crocodile, which still lives, is also regarded as sacred. At To' Baik's tomb Malays, Indians and Chinese make vows and supplication. (32) At Kampong Jalan Baharu, Penang, is the sacred grave of Dato' Janggut, who was born, the youngest of five children, in 1824 A. D. and died in 1884. He had a great name as a religious teacher. After his burial a voice reciting the Quran was heard from his grave. One Friday night a light as of fire shone on the tomb and a figure, the exact likeness of To' Janggut, was sitting there reading a religious book. The tomb became a sacred place. Suppliants offer candles and money there. All</page><page sequence="11">274 Journal Malayan Branch, Royal Asiatic Society [Vol. II who pass by or wish to take any of the money lying there, must invoke the saint thrice for permission, or sickness will overtake them. (33) There was a poor pious keeper of the mosque at the village of Lahar Ikan Mati in Province Wellesley, called Lebai Qadir. When he died, the imam went to the mosque one night to pray for his soul. He fell asleep and Lebai Qadir visited him in a dream and told him that he would answer the vows of all who invoked him. The sick vow to offer saffron rice, slaughter a goat or release a white fowl at his tomb, if they recover. (34) At Ampang three miles from Kuala Lumpur is the sacred tomb of a pious Sumatran immigrant, To' Janggut, who kept a pony and cattle there nearly fifty years ago. When he died, his pony, his buffalo and his cow seemed to go mad and refused food and drink, sleeping at night by the grave. There the pony died first and next the cow and the buffalo. People marvelled and surmised that the deceased waa a saint. The fulfilment of prayers in response to vows made there confirmed this belief. Eich Chinese have built a shrine over the grave, so that it is known as Karamat Tangga China . A yellow mosquito- net is hung over it but renewed at short intervals, as suppliants take scraps of it to make amulets. Another account of this saint is given below (42). (35) In the last century a pious Muslim teacher, Shaikh Abdul-Ghani settled at Gopeng. One day after his death a pupil of his fell into financial trouble and invoked his dead teacher, vowing, " If I am released from this trouble, I will bring flags and water and repair the tomb of my master." His prayer was answered, and the Shaikh's tomb became a sacred place. (36) At Ketapang in the district of Pekan, Pahang, is the sacred grave (makam To ' Panjang) of a pious Malay, Jaafar, who never married. After he died, the head and foot stones of his grave separated to a length of 15 feet. iSo he was accounted a saint and vows are made for his help. (37) A very poor but pious couple lived in the parish of Serandu, Pahang. One Friday the husband died on his praying mat. The wife went to beg a shroud. When she returned with assistance, a light was seen to be shining from the navel of the corpse. Soon after the wife died, also on a Friday. A man passing the graves saw that tall stones adorned them and curtains, and that an angel in the form of an aged man sat within the curtains. The passer-by enquired, what he did. The angel replied, "I guard this sacred tomb." Said the man, "If indeed it be sacred, let the stones be parted." The stones parted, making" the grave 30 feet long. It is called Karamat To' Panjang, Bruas and is at Kampong Marhum in the district of Kuala Pahang. All races respect it.</page><page sequence="12">1924] Winstedt: Karamat. 275 (38) At Kampong Baharu, beside a branch of the Dinding Hiver, is the grave of a pious Chinese convert to Islam, guarded by a crocodile who upsets the boats of the profane and irreverent. Once a rubber-planter ordered his coolies to throw rubbish round the grave. He died and most of the coolies fell sick. Villagers ihen cleaned up the site and found several remarkable objects : - in the middle of the grave a stone three feet high and six feet round, larger at the base than the top; beside the river bank, a large flat stone like a mat, two large and several smaller wells ■and a betel-chewer's stone spittoon. (It is just possible that this spot might be of interest to an .archaeologist?) (39) At Kampong Gedang in the Jelebu district is the «acred grave of To , Rabun, who was born short-sighted (as his name implies) forty years ago and brought his needy parents luck and riches. They died and then their child's presence made the trees and crops of his guardian flourish. To' Rabun also •died at the age of eight. His grave was forgotten till recently the village headman dreamt that the child visited him in a dream, announced that having reached the age of 40 he was a saint, and that his grave would be discovered at the end of a certain gully. There- the dreamer found it, under a huge leban tree. Now folk make supplications to the saint and hang yellow cloth in the sacred tree in his keeping. Many revere the tree rather than the grave. Recently a tiger caused much loss in the neighbourhood till an -old man dreamt the tiger was the saint, who enraged at the villagers' lack of faith in him had taken this form. Living Saints. (40) In Mecca there lived once a pious religious teacher, Shaikh Muhammad, who had a devoted pupil, Shaikh Ahmad. They sailed to Java, where they made many converts and Shaikh Muhammad received the title of Shaikh Mutaram. A year later they came to Mecca, where their shining countenances and the •efficacy of their prayers for the sick earned them the reputation of living saints. They said they would die in Malacca and both asked to be buried on the top of Bukit Gedong. Both died at the same time and were buried, as they had desired, Shaikh Mutaram on the right of his friend. A pupil of Shaikh Mutaram dreamt that his master had become a saint and going to the hilltop discovered that the distance between the two graves and between their headstones and footstones had grown! He prayed that if his dream were true, a strange snake and a strange bird might appear. Straightway they appeared but vanished when he prayed. To this day these sacred graves are honoured by suppliants. (41) About 1880 A. D. there came to Klang an Arab, Shaikh Muhammad Ali, said by some to have been a kinsman of Habib Nob whose sacred tomb stands on a hill at Teluk Ayer,</page><page sequence="13">276 Journal Malayan Branch, Royal Asiatic Society [Vol. II in Singapore. He had the gift of seeing the future and all his prophecies came true. He could read thoughts and he cured the sick merely by the words, " Be well." His uvula was hairy and he clipped it once a week. In his life he became a saint and his tomb near Simpang Lima, Klang, is the resort of those who- want children or health. A way to test if the dead saint will cause a vow to be fulfilled is to take a stick and say, ' If thou wilt help me, let this stick grow longer if help is to be forth- coming, it will lengthen at once. All races make vows at this tomb. (42) There was a poor pious Sumatran, Shaikh Taih, who wandered about Selangor asking alms and living at times as a hermit. Once he lived as a hermit at Batang Kali for seven days. Wherever he did this has become a sacred spot ( Jcaramat ). He always read as he walked. House or mosque he would enter by one door and always leave by another or through a window. If he came across any article lying right side up he would turn it bottom upwards: any article lying bottom upwards he would place right side up, saying " It must be tired of one position " Г His prayer could revive the sick. The alms people gave to him he distributed to the poor. He was recognized as a saint. He settled at Tangga China and died there where his grave is revered as a sacred place. (43) At Jeram in Selangor, there lived a pious old Javanese, Lebai Husain. Once when he was about to go to Mecca,, all his money was stolen. Soon afterwards he said to his children, "Tonight I go to Mecca" and forthwith vanished. At morning prayer he reappeared with shining face and a sweet smell. He got to care little for food 'and drink and raiment and he prayed much. One day he prophesied that in three days time a shoal of whales would be cast up on the beach. This happened and the- English collected skin and skeleton of one whale. Another time a woman brought an infant blind in one eye. Before she spoke he divined her purpose. With his spittle he cured the child's sight. A man complained of the theft of his goods. " On Fridays at dawn the thief will lay them by your house-ladder " said Lebai Husain and his words came true. While alive he was; accounted a saint and his tomb is a place of pilgrimage for all races. fr (44) A pious Javanese goldsmith, Pa' Tukang Rena, settled at Serkam in Malacca and married there. One day digging his garden he struck a large lump of gold which however turned the colour of coal. He died and his wife sold the property. The eldest son of the buyer, and his pious wife, Che Puteh, built a house opposite the tomb of the dead goldsmith: Che' Puteh dreamt that a bearded saint in Arab dress appeared and said to- iler, "Guard my tomb in your garden and you shall have your reward." This she did and burnt incense there every Thursday night. One day seven snakes were descried in a bunch on the</page><page sequence="14">1924] Winstedt: Karamat . 277 roof of Che' Puteh's house. After a while they vanished and two hours later dollars and silver and copper coins rained from the roof every quarter of an hour for a whole hour. Che' Puteh fainted. Those present prayed, " If in truth here is the tomb of á saint (wali), may this woman recover." Straightway she revived. After that all races believed in the sanctity of the grave but suppliants must use Che* Puteh as an intermediary, .and tell her their need, whereupon she will light tapers and burn incense at the tomb. Che' Puteh herself has become a living saint ( karamat hidup) and wears yellow robes every day. People give her many offerings! (45) Formerly there lived at Chembong in the Eembau district a very poor pious orphan, called Lebai Janggut. One day he fell into a trance lasting several hours. On recovery he discoursed of the pillars of Islam, of divination, of the places in the neighbourhood frequented by Muslim genies and the way to placate them. People said, ' He has become a saint 9 and bonoured him. Many besought him for amulets and medicine. Once he persuaded the villagers to build a mosque of bricks ( masjid tanah). For drum he bade them get a tree-trunk thirty feet long. When the trunk was bored and ready, thirty men failed to lift it, till Lebai Janggut waved over it seven times. •On Thursday evenings and feast days it sounded of its own accord. In the mosque at that time was a basket of a hundred plates not of mortal fashioning. To this day on Fridays and other days people pay their vows to the dead saint. (46) At Bukit Tunjang in Kedah there lived a very pious man, To' Alim. His person was fair; his teeth, his nails and ЪаН his tongue were black. For his ritual ablutions he used forty four cans of water. He wore seven layers of raiment, like his grandfather To' Dahman, who was also a karamat . On a Thursday night in A. H. 1340 he died. The same night he informed the Sultan of Kedah of the occurrence in a dream and bade His Highness invoke him if ever there were trouble in the land. The Sultan attended his obsequies. He was buried on the top of Bukit Tunjang. His gravestone is fifteen feet long and the grave is Tmown as the sacred place of the White Stone ( Karamat Batu Puteh). Every year his descendants fix beside it in a tall tree a revolving v/heel of bamboos slit so as to make a roaring sound : •omission to do this would bring misfortune. Invocation of this saint will make his tomb or a tiger appear before one, if such an apparition has been prayed for. (47) in 1876 A. D. an Arab, Sayid Makbuli, came to 'Taiping anu settled there as a religious teacher. One day a Malay suffering from discoloration of the skin ( sopak ) held out his hands for alms. The Sayid prayed to Allah, spat on the skin and the disease vanished. The patient contrived to give a thanksgiving feast to the Sayid and a few friends. The Sayid disked him why he had not invited more people. He replied that</page><page sequence="15">Û78 Journal Malayan Branch, Royal Asiatic Society [Vol. II he had not got enough rice. " Go " said the Sayid, " and call all the folk from the mosque." Then he prayed to Allah and the rice on the dish, so far from being insufficient, did not decrease although all helped themselves to it. He was recognized as a saint. When he died in 1886, his grave near the Taiping mosque became a sacred place. (48) Seventy years ago a Perak Malay dwarf only three feet tall was leader of the mosque at Menglembu. He was called Imam Pandak. Every morning it was his custom to go in search of some particular food, mush-rooms or fish or fruit: nothing else would he take home, and whether he got his hearťs desire or not he returned home about ten o'clock. Though poor he gave alms. If a borrower failed to repay, ill-luck overtook him. He was fond of buying and releasing wild animals and birds. When he reached the age of forty, folk invoked him as a saint. When at the age of 48 he died, a huge crowd attended the funeral and then incontinently disappeared. The villagers said they must have been angels or Muslim genies. The grave is only 3 feet long. In 1919 A. D. one Haji Abdul-Kahman tried to fell a durian tree beside this grave but though he hacked it for four days and cut it almost through, it would not fall until he invoked the assistance of this Saint. (49) There was once a swashbuckler, AbuVSamad, who- fled from Patani on account of his misdeeds and went to Mecca where he lived for years. At last one of his pupils, Haji Ismail, brought him to Kampong Permatang on Sungai Dua in Province Wellesley. There he married and had children. He had a wonder- ful turtle-dove ( тётЪоТс ) which often crowed by day: when it crowed at night, good luck came on the morrow. The bird died and a month later, its corpse was found beneath the house uncorrupted: it was baîhed, shrouded and is still kept in a box. Also AbuVSamad kept a hen that crowed like a cock. One day- as she was cooking, his wife saw the water in a jar was finished: her husband fetched water from the well and in it floated a wonderful white mushroom! These portents and his piety have earned Haji AbuVSamad the name of a saint. In 1917 A. D. Sultan Abdul- Jalil of Perak visited him. He is about 80 years'" old now. (50) About 2Ю0 years ago there lived in the Temerloh district of Pahang, a pious boy .Shaikh Abdullah who devoted his- life to religion and fed only once a day or once in four days. One Friday he vanised but at last was found in the mosque beside- the bilal, clad in sweet-smelling raiment and shining with a radiant light. Another day, when his boat capsized in a storm, he walked ashore on the water. So he got the name of a living- saint. During great floods, he would tie branches and fronds to tall tree trunks to help mice and insects to escape. In A. H. 1135 he sailed for Mecca and stayed there for five years. He died in A. H. 1160 aged 75 years. His grave is known as makam</page><page sequence="16">1924] WiNSTEDT : Karamat. 279 To' Shaikh Sentang . Seven days after the burial, the head and foot stones separated and are now 15 feet apart. Vows are frequently paid there. (51) There was born in the district of Temerloh Pahangr a man of mixed Indian descent, Haj i Abubakar son of Haj i Abdul- Karim, and grandson of Tambi Badoh (whose sacred grave is at Pulau Malang). He acquired much religious knowledge partly by study, mainly in dreams. All his words came true and despite his protests folk began to make supplications and fulfil vows to him as a living saint. He was master of a charm ( pětunang bělit) that could send a bullet to its mark, though that mark were invisible and the gun pointed in another direction. He was as strong as seven elephants. His profession was that of a boat- builder. He died in 1891 A. D. at the age of 120 and his grave at Kampong Karai is sacred.</page></plain_text>
