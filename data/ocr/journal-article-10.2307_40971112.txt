<plain_text><page sequence="1">Fabling Beasts: Traces in Memory / BY NICHOLAS HOWE ¿_ We will make a Zion out of this Sinai and we will build there three tabernacles, one for the Psalms, one for the Prophets, and one for Aesop. (Martin Luther)1 "Animals don't find it hard to die," he says gently. "Perhaps we should take our lesson from them. Perhaps that is why they are with us here on earth- to show us that living and dying are not as hard as we think." (J. M. Coetzee, 1994, p. 208) iJour grapes, tortoise and hare, country mouse and city mouse, Stuart Little, mouse and lion, Detroit Lions, The Jungle Book, William Wegman dog photographs, Saturday morning cartoons, Big Bird and Miss Piggy, Babar, a certain purple dinosaur, Animal Farm, Mickey Mouse, Art Spiegelman's Maus, wolf in sheep's clothing, sly as a fox, Reynard the Fox, Tony the Kellogg's Tiger, the Esso Tiger in Your Tank, cars called Jaguar or Cougar or Lynx, Puma athletic shoes, The Lion King, Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats, Cats (the musical), the boy who cried wolf, the goose that laid the golden eggs- these are but a few of the traces left in our memories, both personal and cultural, by the human act of fabling beasts. The term "fabling beasts" denotes something quite simple and, therefore, hard to define precisely: the activity of telling stories in words about animals, sometimes with and sometimes without people, in order to point a moral that humans believe should hold SOCIAL RESEARCH, Vol. 62, No. 3 (Fall 1995)</page><page sequence="2">642 SOCIAL RESEARCH throughout the natural world. As H. J. Blackham emphasizes, the fable is "about what can be thought of without time or place" (1985, p. 210). In this act of fabling, animals can imitate the behaviors of humans, humans can imitate the behaviors of animals, but most of all the genre calls into question all categor- ical distinctions between animals and humans. If animals can speak in human language, and they must if there are to be beast fables, then the most cherished of our modern distinctions be- tween human and animal- that based on language as a creative, recursive faculty- seems pointless, even evasive. The relation between beast fables and Saturday morning car- toons for children is, of course, more obvious than that between beast fables and many of the traces listed above. If advertise- ments can persuade us that driving a Jaguar will give us a dark aura of feline grace, or if calling teams Tigers, Sharks, Bulls, or Eagles makes us believe they will be more likely to win, then distinctions between humans and animals blur in a different way: for these names allow humans to acquire some of the force we attribute talismanically to animals and also, we like to think, some of their elegance of purpose. Our notions about animals do seem most childish when they become the nomenclature of big- time sports and mass advertising. For who but a child can believe that a Jaguar gives its driver feline grace, or that calling a hockey team from San José the Sharks insures that it will defeat a team from Anaheim (and the Disney Empire) called the Mighty Ducks? Yet, if in the natural world sharks are more ferocious or aggres- sive than ducks, so by a discernible logic it must be in the world of a child's desiring. After a certain age, however, believing such things about Jaguars or Sharks suggests that one has never quite left behind the world of children's books and beast fables. For we as adults rarely think much about beast fables, and if we do, we like them least when they are most preachy. Our tolerant skepticism toward the genre is finely registered by the title of Lloyd W. Daly's collection, Aesop without Morals (1961). If we must have collections of fables, his title suggests, let them be free of tedious moralizings tacked on at the end to convince</page><page sequence="3">FABLING BEASTS 643 us that stories about animals have didactic value. As two more recent translators of Aesop, Patrick and Justina Gregory, remark: "It seems to us that these moral tags not only jar with the fables' sophistication of form, but also deprive them of one of their prime functions: to make the reader think" (The Fables . . . , 1975, p. 2). That we burden animals by asking them to teach us how to behave like human beings seems no more than yet another way of exploiting them. We force animals to do physical labor, we raise them under cruel conditions, we mistreat them in all sorts of ways, and then we domesticate them most fully by moralizing them. Far better, it would seem, to read accounts by naturalists who observe animals in their own environments to learn about the natural world, who resist treating animals as figures to be written into beast fables to confirm our moral categories. If we use animals to write about our concerns, let it be with a gentle reserve, with the sense that we are crossing lines or confusing categories that they themselves do not cross or confuse. Consider, as such an example, "Apartment Cats" (1971), a poem by our contemporary Thorn Gunn. The title registers the poet's awareness that the animals he describes exist in a space separate from even the outside world of domesticated pets. These are cats who live entirely amid human surroundings. The poem's speaker describes coming home and being greeted by "The Girls," as he calls the cats, who go through a routine of awakening, stretching, sniffing his shoe "rich with an outside smell," and rolling on the floor to be petted. Gunn continues: "Now, more awake, they re-enact Ben Hur / Along the corridor, / Wheel, gallop . . . ." The final stanza moves toward its quietly observed truth: And then they wrestle: parry, lock of paws, Blind hug of close defence, Tail-thump, and smothered mew. If either, though, feels claws, Che abruptly rises, knowing well How to stalk off in wise indifference (Gunn, 1994, p. 194).</page><page sequence="4">644 SOCIAL RESEARCH Only the allusion to cats racing in the corridor like charioteers in Ben Hur seems to impose human knowledge on feline behavior; the rest is simply observation about two cats in an apartment. And yet the phrase "Ben Hur" is enough to remind us that all of the poem is attributed human knowledge, that it is our reading of cat behavior to draw an unobtrusive but fully moralized point: that when they play, cats follow rules that we humans would do well to emulate. For like them we should, when the rules of the moment are transgressed, know "to stalk off in wise indifference." There are at least three reasons this poem does not seem a beast fable: it speaks of two specific cats ("The Girls" in the poet's affectionate phrasing); it makes no claim that all cats behave in a predictable way as fables require their animals to do (a dull-witted fox would be absurd by the rules of the genre); and it requires interpretation to understand its moral (and thus allows one's interpretation to be rejected as overly determined, as a misreading). By contrast, the fables we remember always portray typical beasts who remain true to their species (sly foxes always want grapes); they maintain quite strict conventions of behavior for animals and people (foxes cannot climb trees to get at grapes); and they state their morals explicitly ("So it is with men, too. Some who can't do what they want because of their own inability blame it on circumstances" [Daly, 1961, p. 268]). Or so it seems as we hold one or two fables in memory: the fox that consoles itself by calling the grapes it cannot reach sour; the goose that lays golden eggs but is not itself made of gold; the boy who relieves the tedium of watching sheep by raising false alarms about wolves. In a curious way, though, as we remember individual fables we distort the genre because we mistake traces of memory for the form itself. Knowing a moralized fable or two rather than living with many of them is like studying a particular animal in its natural environment without refering to anything else in that same environment. It is convenient, perhaps necessary, but it leads to overly certain findings.</page><page sequence="5">FABLING BEASTS 645 That beast fables have left even these limited traces in our memory suggests that they were once a more vital form of representation, that they were once not reserved for children. For the questions they raised about the mutual company of humans and animals were not matters simply for children. Consider, to offer a surprising example of the fable's lost prestige, Plato's account of Socrates' last days in the Phaedo (60D-61C). Socrates, as he calmly awaits death, has become in the Western tradition the exemplar of philosophical self- possession. Plato tells us that Socrates spent his time while imprisoned writing poetry so that he could satisfy what he believed to be the injunction of a prophetic dream he had one night. Lacking any capacity for invention, Socrates says, he decided to versify some of Aesop's fables because he had them at hand (which means most likely that he had them in memory). And then Socrates tells Cebes, another character in the dialogue, to report his versifying of Aesop to Evenus: "So tell Evenus that, Cebes, and bid him farewell, and tell him, if he is wise, to come after me as quickly as he can. I, it seems, am going to-day; for that is the order of the Athenians" {Plato: Phaedo, 1990, pp. 210-13).2 That Socrates consoled himself with Aesop is itself a kind of fable, all the more haunting for its unlikeliness, about our reasons for reading fables. Socrates versifying Aesop became a fable for later fabulists because it suggested that such stories could retain value when other ways of thinking or other forms of philosophical discourse faded in the face of elemental circumstances. In the Preface to his great collection, La Fontaine retells this story of Socrates to prove that his own act of fabling beasts is a work of serious literary merit and concludes: "Socrates was not alone in judging poetry and our fables to be sisters" (Spector, 1988, p. xxix).3 In an oblique way we recognize the value of beast fables- their simplicity of form- when we put them in the children's bookcase along with other troubling works that cross adult distinctions between the comforting and the frightening, between the human and the</page><page sequence="6">646 SOCIAL RESEARCH animal. As Annabel Patterson observes shrewdly, "Everybody has been, since childhood, familiar with Aesop's fables, and almost everyone, consequently, believes them to be children's literature" (Patterson, 1991, p. 1). And here we might remember such other "children's books" as Gulliver's Travels and Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, works which feature talking horses and long-legged birds that serve in a game of croquet. Socrates was not alone in valuing beast fables as moral illustrations. Aristotle in the Rhetoric (11.20) recommends them to public speakers addressing popular assemblies, and adds "they have this advantage that, while it is difficult to find similar things that have really happened in the past, it is easier to invent fables" to serve as analogies or illustrations (Aristotle, 1991, pp. 276-77). Aristotle's claim that beast fables are easy to invent is striking because it suggests not only that they are valuable in rhetorical persuasion but also that they come out of a shared body of experiential knowledge. They are easy to make up, in other words, because everyone knows about animals, whether they be of the household, barnyard, or wild variety. (So, too, their currency helps to explain the persuasive force of fables.) As we think about the animals we know- or, at least, that most of us know well who do not study or work with them daily- we see our pets, our companion animals, our cats and dogs and birds and mice. It seems much harder to invent fables from them because they do not display as wide a range of behavior as do animals in the older fable collections. Perhaps that is why an anthology such as John Hollander's Animal Poems (1994) should contain so few examples that we can read as fables. For people in the industrialized West over the last several centuries, when most of the poems in this anthology were written, have grown apart from a diverse company of animals. We live in cities and suburbs with our pets; we visit zoos and watch television documentaries to see exotic animals; we use animal metaphors and read animal books. But we have never encountered anything as routinely</page><page sequence="7">FABLING BEASTS 647 necessary for the workings of a beast fable as a fox raiding our chicken coop. The ways we live with animals, or do not live with them, affect the stories we can tell about them. So, too, the variety of animals we keep daily company with affects the variety of stories we can tell and understand about them.4 Aristotle's claim that the beast fable functions well as illustration was repeated by Isidore of Seville, the seventh- century Christian bishop and encyclopedist. His testimony is historically vital because his great work, the Etymologies, was an essential reference throughout the Middle Ages and into the early Renaissance. Anyone wanting to know how to define fabula (fable) in the period from the seventh through the fourteenth centuries would have been likely to consult Isidore's statement that fables are intended "to produce a recognizable picture of human life through the conversations of imaginary dumb animals" (1911, I. 40).3 The idea that fables have their origin in what seems to us a paradox- the human conversations of mute animals - must also have been a puzzle to the ancient Greeks. As he does with most such puzzles, Aesop explains this one with a fable (number 240): At the direction of Zeus, Prometheus fashioned men and beasts. But when Zeus saw that there were more of the dumb animals, he ordered him to destroy some of the beasts and make them over into men. When he did as he was told, it turned out that the ones who had not been fashioned as men from the start had human form but were bestial in spirit (Daly, 1961, p. 193). This is not a frequently anthologized fable, nor has it left its trace with a memorable phrase like 'sour grapes'. It is, in fact, unsettling as a story about why there can be beast fables, stories which record the human conversa- tions of mute animals, because it posits that animals and humans were made by Prometheus from the same material. Had it been otherwise, it would hardly have been possible for him to remake animals into humans, at least in their outward form. Now, if some of these humans retained their animal nature, that also explains why in turn some animals could</page><page sequence="8">648 SOCIAL RESEARCH possess human characteristics, at least to the extent of speech. The absolute distinctions between humans and animals that today make us increasingly uncomfortable were confused, one might suggest, from the very start. Or so this fable teaches us. The fable as a form explores those regions where human and animal overlap, where it becomes not only hard but also counterintuitive to separate them. The fable is not simply the metaphorizing of human behavior in animal guises, that is, in guises created from human-made or anthropomorphic con- ventions about animals. When modern writers such as George Orwell in Animal Farm and Art Spiegelman in Maus represent human evil as being literally bestial, their mistake lies not in imagining animals to be capable of such behavior. Rather, it lies in treating the beast fable as an allegory or literal equivalence in which, as Speigelman draws it, mice are Jews, cats are Nazis, pigs are Poles, dogs are Americans, and reindeer are Swedes. The difficulty is that if one finds it hard to imagine cats as Nazis, or, more crucially, if one finds representing Nazis as cats to be inadequate (for lack of a better word) to that historical experience, then Maus as a fable collapses. One can argue this point while also understanding and even admiring Spiegelman for depicting that most inescapable, if over-represented event, the Holocaust, through the moral obliqueness of a beast fable.6 That the fable requires a more elemental blurring of human and animal not at the extremes of history (such as the Holocaust) but as a fact of daily life is evident from a wonderful, if spurious Life of Aesop written in the first century A.D., long after its subject would have died in the fifth century B.C.- that is, if he were ever alive to die.7 This Life of Aesop seems to have been written less out of biographical curiousity than out of a felt need to invent an origin story for the genre of beast fable. It is literary theory masquerading as life story. According to the Life, Aesop was a slave of "loathsome aspect," of "portentous monstrosity" (Daly, 1961, p. 31). He was also born mute. He is described by characters in the Life as being</page><page sequence="9">FABLING BEASTS 649 one or another ugly beast or object, as when the Samians cry out: "What a monstrosity he is to look at! Is he a frog, or a hedgehog, or a pot-bellied jar, or a captain of monkeys, or a moulded jug, or a cook's gear, or a dog in a basket?" (1961, p. 74). At another moment, when Aesop's master orders his steward to sell him in the slave-market, the steward responds: "Who will want to buy him and have a baboon instead of a man?" (1961, p. 35). The point is clear: Aesop in his bestial ugliness and muteness is for all intents and purposes an animal, most likely a baboon. But then one day he shows great kindness to a priestess of Isis, and the goddess herself rewards him with the gift of speech. So, too, each of the Muses gives him some gift of her own art (1961, pp. 33-4). Only after this transformation does Aesop's master succeed in selling him to a slave-dealer who just this once is searching the area to buy not slaves but pack animals (1961, p. 36). Again, the implication is clear: Aesop is at least as much animal as human, even if he possesses speech. After the dealer succeeds in selling Aesop to the philosopher Xanthus on the island of Samos, a maid of the house greets him in this way: 'Are you the new slave?' Aesop said, 'I'm the one.' The maid: 'And where's your tail?' Aesop took a look at the girl and, realizing that she was making fun of his dog's head, said, 'My tail doesn't grow behind in the way you think, but here in front' (1961, p. 46). Aesop's obscene response to the maid's taunt of bestiality is the first sign in the Life that his wit comes from a sense of being somewhere between the categories of animal and human. If she accuses him of having a tail, he will in turn allude to his penis, which is, as we later learn, enormous (1961, p. 67). In time, the Samians come to respect Aesop for his wisdom and even prefer his fables to the teachings of his master, Xanthus. When the citizens ask Aesop for advice, he responds with fables which allude to a past time "when animals talked</page><page sequence="10">650 SOCIAL RESEARCH the same language as men" (1961, pp. 77, 88), that is, to a time when fables were not necessary because there could be direct communication among species. The Life explains that Aesop wrote the majority of his fables after he was freed and "deposited them in the library/' a fact that explains how it is that they survived to circulate as written texts. After wandering through many lands, the Life tells us, Aesop met a grisly death in Delphi where, by a decree of the citizens, he was pushed over a cliff for honoring the Muses rather than Apollo. For remaining loyal to the nine sisters who had each given him some of her gift after he gained the power of speech, Aesop fell victim to "the ritual sacrifice of the scapegoat (pharmakos)" a tellingly ironic fate for the creator of the beast fable (Perry, 1965, p. xlii). In turn, the Delphians are punished with a plague, the Life tells us, and an injunction by Zeus that they expiate the killing of Aesop. Without ever slipping into explicit statement, the Life records the birth of the beast fable as a genre by tracing the stages of Aesop's career. As grotesque and inarticulate as an animal, as rational and economically valuable as a man (because a slave and, thus, a saleable commodity), Aesop seems a liminal creature. By his act of human kindness to a divine stranger, he gains speech so that he can utter his wisdom. But his wisdom is not that of academic philosophers, like his master Xanthus. It is instead practical, moral instruction that can be understood by anyone who hears or reads his fables. It is a wisdom that derives from a time before animals lost their ability to use speech. Only when Aesop is freed and no longer a slave, a category neither quite animal nor quite human, does he compose and inscribe his fables. And only then does he fall victim to the kind of human behavior that seems so incomprehensibly evil that we distance it by labelling it bestial. The Life of Aesop is by my reading an attempt to explain the riddle posed by the fable as a genre: How is it that anyone can know enough to narrate all of the various creatures it depicts? How can anyone know what words to give the fox or what</page><page sequence="11">FABLING BEASTS 651 behavior to ascribe to the tortoise? And more, how can any being that knows all this also know how to speak to human beings? In other words, as you trace out the Life, you comprehend the genre. In this way, the name of Aesop came in antiquity and afterwards to designate the author of all fables (Ziolkowski, 1993, p. 16). By an irony he might have predicted, Aesop has become as stock a figure as any of the animals or people who appear in the genre: the fabulist of beasts. This Life of Aesop survives in a tenth-century A.D. manuscript held by the Pierpont Morgan Library (MS M.397).8 In this Greek manuscript from the south of Italy (tenth or eleventh century), Aesop is depicted with a misshapen head that gives him something of a canine appearance. That collections of fables, whether by Aesop or such later writers as Marie de France and William Caxton, are frequently illus- trated with drawings reminds us that the fable is itself an illustration, a sketch in words that creates a picture.9 Fables typically present a moment or moralized scene that can be represented visually to good effect. There are recent transla- tions of, to cite only the most famous names in the genre, Aesop and La Fontaine which feature new illustrations.10 Tellingly, the title page of the Aesop volume names the illustrator, David Levine, before the translators, Patrick and Justina Gregory. We might also consider that such illustrations, especially when drawn by a gifted cartoonist such as David Levine, function much like those moralizations we modern readers claim to dislike. For these illustrations make explicit to the eye what the text presents implicitly and, thus, do the work of moralizing. Medieval men and women who met Aesop in a manuscript had, in a direct and palpable way, a richer and yet more ambiguous experience as readers than we can have. As they read fables written on the prepared skin of an animal, most likely of a sheep or a calf, they saw that the words spoken by animals were inscribed quite literally on the back of a beast so that they could be read by human beings. This circumstance at</page><page sequence="12">652 SOCIAL RESEARCH the very least would have reminded medieval readers that fables merited being written on the same rare and expensive material as did the most sacred of texts, the most learned of commentaries, the most jealously guarded of legal privileges. To translate my point into our economic terms, medieval fables were not relegated to the children's hour of Saturday morning television. Nowhere is the medieval reverence for the beast fable more evident and yet also more perplexing to the modern reader than in Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. The most elusive of the Tales, the one most stubbornly resistant to any of our sophisticated theories of interpretation, is a beast fable called The Nun's Priest's Tale. The title refers to the pilgrimage character who is supposed to tell it, and gives no hint that it is a fable about a widow, a rooster, and a fox. At some 625 lines, The Nun's Priest's Tale is far longer than any of Aesop's fables, but, like some of them, it turns on how one animal tricks another into opening its mouth and thus dropping its prize, as in the well-known example of the fox persuading the crow to drop its morsel of meat (number 124). Chaucer's tale opens by describing the widow's barnyard and its various inhabitants: the rooster Chauntecleer; his harem of seven hens, including his favorite Pertelote; three sows; three cows; a sheep called Malle; and three dogs called Colle, Talbot, and Gerland. One morning, Chauntecleer awakens from dreaming about an unknown beast that looks like a hound, is between yellow and red in color, has a tipped tail and ears, and two glowing eyes. Chauntecleer has no name for this beast- obviously a fox- perhaps because the naming of species is a human concern, perhaps because this wild beast inhabits a different sphere and is thus unfamiliar to Chauntecleer. He does tell Pertelote that the beast wanted to seize and eat him. She dismisses his dream and its value as oracular warning with an extended lecture on medieval dream physiology and psychology. Simply put, she tells Chauntecleer that his bad dream is a result of too much "red choler" and advises him to</page><page sequence="13">FABLING BEASTS 653 take a laxative and purge himself, much as we might take an Alka-Seltzer after awakening from a nightmare caused by eating too much pizza too late at night. At this moment, The Nuns Priest's Tale moves into its most crucial revision of the beast fable, one that raises very high claims for the genre, by presenting a long and learned discussion between Chauntecleer and Pertelote on the ways in which dreams are to be understood as a form of knowledge. Readers, especially those familiar with this discussion else- where in medieval philosophy, are likely to forget that Chaucer's text is in fact spoken by chickens. They display all the features of learned speakers in medieval texts: they bolster their arguments by alluding to honored authorities; they score debaters' points; they talk to hear the sound of their own voices. Their resemblance to academics may explain why I once heard an eminent Chaucerian open a talk about The Nuns Priest's Tale by asking: "Do we really think this is a tale about chickens?" The audience, polite to a fault, murmured appreciatively at this suave opening gambit, but now I wish I had said "Yes, it is about chickens and how they look at the world. And if it is not about chickens, then it is about nothing at all." The precise substance of the discussion in Chaucer's tale is not of immediate concern, but I can translate it into contemporary terms by asking you to imagine my cats, Mimi and Lola, interrogating Wittgenstein's dictum that "the limits of my language mean the limits of my world." (An aside: when I said this to my wife, she asked, "What else do you think they talk about all day?") After a long discussion about dreams, complete with learned allusions to Cato, Macrobius, and other revered authorities, the substance of Chauntecleer's dream comes to pass: Don Russell the fox enters the barnyard, flatters Chauntecleer into singing for him, then seizes him by his outstretched neck, and makes off for the woods. A cry of alarm is raised, the old widow and her animals chase after Chauntecleer in a scene that the narrator compares to such moments from epic history</page><page sequence="14">654 SOCIAL RESEARCH as the Greeks sacking Troy and Nero burning Rome. When Russell with Chauntecleer firmly in his mouth enters the woods, the barnyard rooster urges the woodland fox to turn on his pursuers and tell them that they must return home because they are violating their nature by chasing him into his territory. The fox agrees, opens his mouth to speak, and, thus, Chauntecleer flies away to make good his escape to the safety of a tree. Part of Chaucer's fable is to revise the fable's generic convention by showing that the fox is indeed too sly for his own good. That a rooster and a hen can talk intelligently about dream psychology and epistemology might seem at first no more than Chaucer's joke about the folly of human concerns. By one reading, The Nun's Priest's Tale is simply brilliant satire. But such a reading neglects many issues: that throughout his work Chaucer takes dream psychology and epistemology very seriously; that the chickens have shrewd points to make about these philosophical concerns; that Chaucer elsewhere casts animals (often birds) as authority figures; and, most crucially, that at the end of The Nun's Priest Tale Chauntecleer uses what he has learned from interpreting his dream to persuade the fox to open his mouth. That is, this one fable illustrates the value of fables as a genre; it proves that knowing them may help you save your own neck or, conversely, your dinner. Anticipating that we might find The Nun's Priest Tale to be a piece of foolishness, Chaucer ends with a brief speech of authorial instruction: But ye that holden this tale a folye, As of a fox, or of a cok and hen, Taketh the moralité, goode men. For Saint Paul seith that al that writen is, To oure doctrine it is ywrite, ywis; Taketh the fruyt, and lat the chaf be stille. (Benson, 1987, p. 261, 11.3438-43) The Pauline injunction to take the fruit and let the chaff be</page><page sequence="15">FABLING BEASTS 655 seems no more than an injunction here to take the moral of the fable and let its narrative be. Yet it is not that simple. For if there can be no fruit without the chaff, so there can be no moral without the narrative. Or, in the terms of the genre, without the words of chickens there can be no truth for humans to ponder. And in one way, at least, it is the fact that chickens can and do speak about troubling issues of existence which may be the first truth we humans need to ponder. This reading may also reassure us when we stop to notice that properly speaking The Nuns Priest's Tale has no pithy moral at its end. The Nuns Priest Tale can be read as providing a key to the genre of the beast fable and also as suggesting an explanation for its decline. Central to both readings is the fable's setting. It takes place chiefly in a barnyard bound on one side by the human (the house of the old widow who owns the rooster and the rest of the domestic animals) and on the other side by the wild (the woods where the fox makes his home). This kind of symbolic setting features two clearly demarcated zones (the house and the woods) as well as an intermediate zone that links the two and, thus, gives each its meaning (the barnyard).12 It is the talking rooster, the figure at once animal and human, who makes this symbolic topography explicit when he urges the wild fox to tell the human widow and her barnyard animals that they cannot go into the woods because it is for them forbidden territory. This sense of place does not govern each and every fable ever told, but it does underlie the fable's sense that the human and animal exist together as something other than a rigid binary opposition. Put another way, the setting of The Nuns Priest's Tale and the sequence of events in the Life of Aesop are alike in explaining how it is that humans and animals can do what is so palpably obvious they do: speak to each other. Just as barnyards have disappeared from the common experience of people living in cities, so fables have slipped out of our normal range of reference and discourse. A few traces</page><page sequence="16">656 SOCIAL RESEARCH remain, perhaps more than are listed at the start, but what does seem gone is the impulse as well as the ability to create new fables. We are in that sense surprised by William Hazlitt's avowal that "I would rather have been the author of Aesop's Fables, than of Euclid's Elements^ (Blackham, 1985, p. xvi). In making this claim, I must admit at least one exception: contemporary writers like Gerald Vizenor have created tricksters or shapeshifters that move as characters between the human and the animal. But these writers are novelists, not fabulists, and they would be uncomfortable if I attached morals to their tales. And there lies another reason for the slow disappearance of the beast fable. For much as we claim that fables can exist apart from their morals, we know that this really is not true. We know that the very act of telling a story in which an animal does something it cannot do in life- speak Latin or English or French- becomes a moral critique of the order by which we interpret our experience. That fables tell stories about another order of experience, one in which humans and animals each speak to one another, suggests a longstanding unhappiness with the way things are. When we lived and worked in barnyards and knew animals as something other than pets or exotica, we understood that the beast fable could have a moral function. This knowledge came with belonging to a group defined at least in part by its knowledge of animals, knowledge not strictly speaking scientific but rather traditional or experiential. Within the group that tells them, fables must depend on reasonably fixed associations between a particular species and a certain form of animal behavior as it can be used to gloss human behavior. In its allusiveness, the fable demands a community of knowledge. Once we stopped knowing animals as a direct matter of survival- as partners in work, as quarry to hunt, as predators to evade- fables could be read as stories about cute animals that could safely be given to children. Similarly, we find the infantilization of animals in cartoons, such as the gradual softening of Mickey Mouse's sharp rodent features that</page><page sequence="17">FABLING BEASTS 657 Stephen Jay Gould noted in his essay on that figure's fiftieth birthday (1980). Cartoon animals must be cute and never die because we want our children to be cute and never die. Under these conditions, the beast fable cannot be a vital, or even a possible, form through which adult human beings can explore their place in the larger scheme of the natural world. But let me end by suggesting that as we continue to reimagine our relations with animals as one of continuum rather than difference, then we can also reimagine our representations of them. Perhaps as adults we can listen to them and learn from them. Aesop would, I think, like that.13 Notes 1 Quoted in Ziolkowski, 1993, p. 24. For a reading of this episode in the Phaedo that illuminates the political value of the fable as a genre, see Patterson, 1991, especially Chapter 1.

To translate lightly into modern English: "But you that hold this tale a folly, About a fox, or a cock and hen, Take the morality, good men.
