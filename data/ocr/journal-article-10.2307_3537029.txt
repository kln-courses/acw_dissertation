<plain_text><page sequence="1">REPORTS PRECLASSIC HOUSEHOLD PATTERNS PRESERVED UNDER VOLCANIC ASH AT TETIMPA, PUEBLA, MEXICO Patricia Plunket and Gabriela Urufiuela Located on the northeastern flank of the Popocatepetl volcano in the state of Puebla, Mexico, the Tetimpa region was buried under volcanic ash from two major eruptions: the first, at the beginning of the present era and the second, between A.D. 700 and 850. We review the volcanic and cultural sequences based on 12 radiocarbon dates, and then focus our discussion on the well-preserved house compounds of the occupation destroyed by the first eruption. The village at Tetimpa was abandoned rapidly in the face of disaster; and domestic goods were left in situ, providing us with a unique, almost ethnographic, view of rural life in the Terminal Preclassic. The house compounds follow a highly standardized pattern, consisting of two or three structures set at right angles to one another around a central patio, in a layout similar to that of the three-tenmple complexes at Teotihuacan. The wattle-and-daub walls of the rooms are built on stone talud-tablero platforms with a central staircase. Small shrines, located at the midpoint of each patio, provide evidence that volcanic activity formed part of the domestic rit- ual focus. La region de Tetimpa, ubicada en la falda noreste del volcdn Popocatepetl, quedo en tiempos prehispdnicos sepultada bajo la ceniza volcdnica emitida por dos importantes erupciones: la primera de estas, a inicios de nuestra era, y la segunda, entre 700 y 850 d. C. Con base en 12 fechas de radiocarbono, revisamos aqui tanto la secuencia volcdnica como la cultural, para posteriormente enfocar la discusion especificamente sobre las unidades domesticas precldsicas, excelentemente preservadas, correspondientes a la ocupacion destruida por la primera de las erupciones mencionadas. Ante el desastre inminente, la aldea de Tetimpa fue aparentemente abandonada de subito, dejando in situ la mayoria de los bienes domesticos, lo que nos proporciona asi una visi6n unica, casi etnogrdfica, de la vida rural en el Precldsico Terminal. Los conzplejos habitacionales siguen un patron altamente estandarizado, que consiste de dos o tres estructuras colocadas en angulos rectos alrededor de un patio central, en un acomodo semejante al de los complejos teotihuacanos de tres templos. Los cuartos de bajareque estdn construidos sobre plataformas con talud-tablero, y se accede a ellos por una escalinata central delimitada por alfardas. El contexto inalterado ha permitido incluso documentar la existencia de areas familiares de culto, generalmente marcadas por pequenos adoratorios localizados en la parte central de los patios, mediante los cuales se ha obtenido evidencia de que la actividad volcdnica formaba parte del enfoque ritual domestico. RF ortunately for humankind, but unfortu- nately for archaeology, cataclysmic vol- canic eruptions are relatively rare events. Although it seems contradictory, the most dra- matic examples of both destruction and preserva- tion of human settlements often are found at ancient communities located in high-risk areas of volcanic activity, and we only need to mention sites like Pompeii and Herculaneum in Italy and Cuicuilco and El Ceren in Meosamerica to sup- port this assertion. Plinian ash falls, as opposed to lava flows or surges, provide the most interesting prospects for archaeology: When the column of tephra rises high into the atmosphere from the crater and then collapses over the landscape, the pumitic material blankets the agricultural fields, buildings, and activity areas in a way that effec- tively preserves them for future study. The local inhabitants flee, some with more luck than others, and in their haste they often leave behind many of their household goods, providing archaeologists with an impressive array of primary contexts that are particularly relevant to modem research goals related to understanding past lifeways.

Tetimpa, located on the northeastern flank of the Popocatepetl volcano in the state of Puebla, Mexico (Figure 1), is just such a site. It was first mentioned in the literature by researchers from the Fundaci6n Alemana para la Investigaci6n Cientifica (FAIC) (Seele 1973; Tschohl and Nickel 1972), who described the presence of fur- rowed agricultural fields, ceramics, and the remains of stone and adobe buildings interbedded with distinct layers of pumice and soil in the vicinity of San Buenaventura Nealtican and San Nicolas de los Ranchos, about 15 km west of Cholula. The archaeological remains were dis- covered when a local farmer, lamenting the low productivity of his land, decided to mine these layers of pumice underneath the topsoil, sell the material to a construction company, and then resume farming on the paleosol at the base of these volcanic deposits. The easy availability of this pumice has led to the establishment of local cottage industries that produce cinder block and provide an important economic alternative to farming in the region. Although mining of the fields has greatly accelerated over the last 25 years, leading to a good deal of destruction, there still are many intact areas where the pumice pre- [Vol. 9, No. 4, 1998] 288</page><page sequence="3">REPORTS serves and protects the ancient cultural remains. In 1993, the authors initiated a research project designed to study the impact of the Popocatepetl volcano on the Prehispanic towns and villages that once dotted its northeastern slope. Our pri- mary objectives have been to identify and date the volcanic events recorded on this part of the moun- tain, reconstruct the types of eruptions that occurred in order to understand the human expe- rience, document the material remains of the buried settlements, estimate the extent and nature of the destruction, and assess the impact of these eruptions on the western part of the Valley of Puebla. Tetimpa is located at an elevation of approxi- mately 2,350 m. Although the rolling hills were originally covered with a pine and evergreen oak forest, today the area is planted with corn, beans, flowers, and orchards of plum, pear, and apple. The landscape is dominated by the Popocatepetl volcano (Figure 2), one of the largest and most impressive active volcanoes in the world. Together with its northern neighbor Iztaccfhuatl, Popocat6petl constitutes a formidable geographic barrier between the Valleys of Mexico and Puebla. It rises to a height of 5,450 m above sea level and covers an area of 500 km2, although its products, including lava flows, pyroclastic deposits, and lahars, spread over 1,000 km2 (Robin and Boudal 1987: 116). During the Prehispanic period two major volcanic eruptions devastated the communities on the northeastern flank of the volcano, and Popocatepetl's recent eruptive activity has triggered fears that soon his- tory may repeat itself, causing major problems for both Mexico City and Puebla de los Angeles, which lie 65 and 45 km, respectively, from its crater. The Cultural and Volcanic Sequences The initial occupation of Tetimpa, designated the Early Tetimpa phase, occurred around 700 B.C., during the Middle Preclassic period, when a set- tlement was established in the fertile piedmont of the volcano. This early village was at least par- tially abandoned by 200 B.C. At the two Early Tetimpa phase households we have excavated to date, a sandy volcanic soil accumulated over the occupation floors and/or the ruined wall founda- tions. The reasons for this interruption in the set- tlement sequence are unclear, but we suspect that they may be related to an increasing awareness of the hazards presented by Popocatepetl, or even actual volcanic events whose products are not readily apparent in the local Tetimpa stratigraphy. A growing body of archaeological and geological data suggest that the Late Preclassic and Early Classic witnessed numerous volcanic events of varying intensity, from plumes of vapor to violent eruptions, in the Sierra de Chichinautzin that sep- arates the Basin of Mexico from Morelos to the south (Barba 1995; Cordova et al. 1994), and of Popocatepetl in the Sierra Nevada to the east (Panfil 1996; Plunket and Urufiuela 1998b; Siebe et al. 1996). It will take much more work, how- ever, before we will be able to precisely correlate the entire volcanic sequence with historic events and cultural processes. The resettlement of the region, or Late Tetimpa phase, was underway by the middle of the first century B.C., and the dwellings of this second occupation were constructed directly on top of the paleosol that accumulated over the first houses. Farmers mounded earth around their plants to cre- ate sequences of linear ridges that look very sim- ilar to the furrows of modern plowed fields and that reflect an agricultural technology designed, at least in part, to prevent the erosion of the fine sandy soil on the sloping terrain during the heavy downpours of the summer months (Figure 3). This furrowed paleosol and the structures built upon it were abruptly buried by an airfall deposit of between 1 and 1.5 m of yellow pumice that protected and preserved the buildings and activity areas at the same time that it devastated the set- tlement and made the region uninhabitable for many generations to come. The pumice deposit covers an elliptical-shaped area that extends more than 25 km to the east of the volcano's crater, just a few kilometers short of Cholula. Geological studies of the volume, lateral extension, and clast size of the yellow pumice have been used to esti- mate that the plinian column that produced the 3.2 km3 of pyroclastic material that blanketed the northeastern slope of the volcano rose to at least 25 km (Panfil 1996:16). This event undoubtedly would have been visible from all of the surround- ing valleys in the central highlands of Mexico. Immediately to the south of Tetimpa, across what is now the barranca (ravine) formed by the 289</page><page sequence="4">LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Figure 2.

The lava flow, known as the Pedregal de Nealtican, altered the surface hydrology of the region, damming and diverting drainages (Panfil 1996:20). The seven calibrated radiocarbon dates associated with the second Preclassic occupation at Tetimpa, taken from sealed cultural contexts, indicate that this violent eruptive sequence took place towards the end of the first century A.D. (Table 1), because most of the dates overlap at the 2 sigma range in the time span between 45 B.C. and A.D. 90. We have tentatively placed the Late Tetimpa phase between 50 B.C. and A.D. 100 based on these 14C dates and the ceramics recovered from three sea- sons of excavation, which include diagnostic traits of Teotihuacan's Tzacualli phase (A.D. 0-150): spiked braseros, censers decorated with thumbed strips of clay, rim-shouldered bowls, and proto-floreros. The absence of vessel supports and solid clay earspools provides additional con- firmation for this Terminal Preclassic dating (Millon et al. 1965; Rattray 1973; Smith 1987; West 1965).

Early Tetimpa phase house covered by paleosol with furrowed agricultural fields of the Late Tetimpa phase that were buried under pumice from the first eruption registered at Tetimpa. A new soil developed on the surface of the yel- low pumice during an interlude in the volcanic activity that apparently lasted from the first cen- tury A.D. until the end of the seventh century. An A soil horizon, consisting of organic accumula- tions and a sandy matrix, is evident in the upper 15 to 40 cm of the yellow pumice (Panfil 1996: 21); around A.D. 500 this surface was reoccupied despite the weak development of the soil and the difficulties of building and farming on the uncon- solidated deposits. This third settlement at Tetimpa, the Nealtican phase, is more difficult to document than the two earlier occupations because it is entirely destroyed by front-end load- ers during mining activities and only is evident in cross-sections along the borders of mined fields. Research on the Nealtican phase reoccupation (e.g., Operation 7) is being supervised by Kenneth Hirth of Pennsylvania State University as part of the Tetimpa Project. Between A.D. 700 and 850, a second major sequence of volcanic events affected the north- eastern flank of Popocatepetl, resulting in the air- fall deposition of more pumice; this episode was accompanied by highly destructive pyroclastic surges and massive lahars that flowed down the slopes (Siebe et al. 1996). Two dates, cal A.D. 660 ? 80 (1-17,625) and cal A.D. 675 ? 70 (Beta- 86483) (Table 1), recovered from the surface of the paleosol that formed on top of the yellow pumice (Figure 4), are associated with the Classic occupation and the eruption that ended the Nealtican phase settlement: both carbon samples probably resulted from a volcanic surge that charred the surface vegetation on this ancient soil (Panfil 1996: 10 and 31). Geological studies sug- gest that the second eruptive sequence consisted of two distinct phases separated by perhaps 150 years, the first occurring about A.D. 700, and the second around A.D. 850 (represented by radiocar- bon dates of cal A.D. 855 ? 60 and 875 ? 70, but not included in Table 1 since they do not come from cultural contexts) (Panfil 1996: 10). Covering the most recent pumice is the moder topsoil composed of sand, silt, and organic mate- rials. There is no evidence of major volcanic events in the Tetimpa region after A.D. 850 (Panfil 1996; Siebe et al. 1996). In this article, we focus on the nature of the Late Tetimpa occupation that was buried by the yellow pumice from the plinian eruption in the first century A.D.

After the pumice fell, collapsing the roofs of the houses, the community was not disturbed again by the constructions, agricultural activities, or looting of later occupations until barely a generation ago. The drama of Tetimpa's fate is what first draws our attention, but its real significance lies in the fact that so few settlements of the Late and Terminal Preclassic in central Mexico, where soils are thin and modem develop- ment is so intense, have survived to any apprecia- ble extent; this is particularly true of villages and simple domestic structures. This period is crucial because it lies on the threshold of urban life, and Tetimpa has much to tell us about community and household patterning, family size, food process- ing-foodstuffs have been found inside ollas and cazuelas, domestic ritual activity, economic orga- nization, and agricultural technology. Here we provide a general discussion that will serve as the basic framework for future studies on more spe- cific aspects of village life at Tetimpa. The Late Tetimpa Phase Settlement As we mentioned above, the rolling topography of the northeastern flank of the Popocatepetl vol- cano was resettled with households surrounded by agricultural fields at some time toward the middle of the first century B.C. It is difficult to document the extent of this occupation or deter- mine whether it was one continuous community or a series of small separate villages because the remains that have not yet been destroyed by the mining activity are still sealed beneath layers of pumice or lava. Experimental studies by Dr. James Fink using ground penetrating radar and dc resistivity have demonstrated that both techniques provide excellent imaging of the subsurface 292 [Vol. 9, No. 4, 1998]</page><page sequence="7">REPORTS SECOND ERUPTIVE SEQUENCE AD 700 - 850 FIRST ERUPTIVE SEQUENCE AD 50 - 100 - 0.00 - 0.20 _ 0.40 - 0.60 - 0.80 -1.00 -1.20 -1.40 -1.60 - 1.80 - 2.00 - 2.20 - 2.40 Figure 4.

Surveys undertaken by the FAIC in the late 1960s documented furrowed fields under the yellow pumice of the first eruption at the southern edge of the Pedregal de Nealtican, near San Juan Tianguismanalco and San Pedro Atlixco (Seele 1973: 83), about 8 to 9 km from Tetimpa, sug- gesting that 2,000 years ago the lower slopes on the eastern side of the volcano were covered with dispersed settlements farming what was then a fertile and attractive ecological niche. Our excavations and surface surveys of mined fields have shown that the occupation at Tetimpa was more or less continuous, although there appears to be some variation in the density of households (Figure 5). At present we do not know if these differences reflect topographic irregulari- ties in the ancient landscape or whether they result from internal community patterning. The interhousehold distances we have documented so far vary between 6 and 86 m, and the uncon- structed areas between houses are filled with fur- rowed agricultural fields that extend almost to the edge of the buildings (Figure 6), leaving only enough space for narrow paths to wind around the outside of the residential compounds. We have found evidence of footpaths through the milpas leading to and from structures, but no roads or streets have been detected. Although we cannot yet calculate the maximum extent of the occupa- tion, we have tentatively estimated that the mini- mum area covered by the Tetimpa settlement was at least 2 km2. Given the variation in household density, this suggests a population of perhaps 400 to 600 families, or between 2,000 and 3,000 peo- ple. We have explored 10 domestic structures, or groups of structures, in three distinct areas (Figure 5): Petlachica, an area of gently sloping 293</page><page sequence="8">LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [ FIELD WITH PUMICE l MODERN BUILDING * DEMOLISHED HOUSE COMPOUND A EXCAVATED HOUSE COMPOUND (EARLY TETIMPA PHASE) * EXCAVATED HOUSE COMPOUND (LATE TETIMPA PHASE) Figure 5.

The first of these tracts, Barranca Nexac, provides a view of the Valley of Puebla below to the east, while the other, Cruz Verde, faces the Sierra Nevada to the west (Figure 2). The houses on the flatter land at Petlachica are constructed directly upon the pale- osol and, in some cases, cover the ruins of Early Tetimpa phase compounds, but those located on the steeper slopes at Barranca Nexac and Cruz Verde had to excavate into the hillside and build a low retaining wall, between 30 and 60 cm high in most cases, on the downslope to create a terrace with enough level building space (Figure 7). These terraces and the edges of the furrowed mil- pas provide the actual limits of the houses at Tetimpa and allow us to generate realistic esti- mates of their total size. The house compounds in each area follow a standard pattern. They consist of two or three structures set at right angles to one another around a central patio (Figure 8). The wattle-and- daub walls of the rooms are built on low stone 294 [Vol. 9, No. 4, 1998]</page><page sequence="9">REPORTS TETIMPA PROJECT 1996 OPERATIONS 9, 10, II AND /2 SCALE O ,i 40" Figure 6.

The platforms use the talud-tablero architectural system, a sloping wall crowned by a horizontal panel, that is con- sidered both typical and diagnostic of Classic period Teotihuacan, although it is now clear that this feature was developed during the Late Preclassic and was employed for both domestic (Plunket and Uruniuela 1998a) and ceremonial structures (Garcia Cook 1981: 252).

In the three-room compounds the spatial pattern is similar to the three-temple complexes at Teotihuacan in the sense that the larger central platform is flanked by two smaller structures. When there are only two rooms in a household, the space where the third room should be is occupied with groups of ollas or small indi- vidual mud-and-wicker storage bins known as cuexcomates. The uniformity of the spatial pat- tern evident in the residential compounds of Tetimpa is significant in reflecting rigid adher- ence to a set of rules used to generate the domes- tic environment. Essentially, the household space is defined by two axes, skewed 15? to 17? east of the cardinal points (MN)2, that intersect at right angles in the center of the patio. This position is always marked by a small shrine or altar that would have served to promote group identity and cohesion through shared domestic rituals. Table 2 provides information on the total area and individual room size at each of the Late Tetimpa residential compounds. It is important to understand that measurements marked with an (*) indicate that the building already had been par- tially destroyed by the time we began our rescue work or that it extended into an adjoining field and therefore could not be fully documented. The reconstructed room sizes in most cases are based on the evident symmetry of the buildings and the observation that the interior room area is usually about 45 percent of the basal dimensions of the platform itself, although there is some variation in this relationship (between 39 and 47 percent), depending primarily on the height of the platform. The size of main rooms has a bimodal distrib- ution, one group ranging between 7.5 and 9.5 m2 and the other between 16 and 17.5 m2. Operation 8, in the Petlachica area, appears to be a special case. The main room had about 43 m2 of roofed space, more than twice the size of the largest rooms at the other compounds. The lateral room also is proportionately larger. In addition, the platform of the principal building at Operation 8 is more than twice as high as the others, reaching 1.78 m above the floor of the patio. We were able to explore only the main structure at this location. As a result, we cannot provide more than rough estimates of the total area occupied or the size of the patio, but this compound may have covered as much as 550 m2 with an ample courtyard of about 250 m'. Differences in size of the main rooms in the compounds do not appear to be associated with a corresponding pattern of size variation in the lat- eral rooms, except perhaps in the case of Operation 8. The majority of the small flanking structures have between 5 and 7 m2 of interior space. We suggest that there is a basic functional difference between the central room and the lat- eral rooms in each compound. The central room, rising behind the household shrine, is what a vis- itor sees when approaching any residential group, making it and the shrine the identifying features of each building complex. The fact that the larger rooms have much wider doorways (ca. 2 m) than the smaller buildings argues for a more commu- nal and generalized function, such as the recep- 296 [Vol. 9, No. 4, 1998]</page><page sequence="11">REPORTS UNIT 3 TETIMPA PROJECT 199, OPERATION II ,i hil:i /FEIAIid-??

The doorways of the side rooms are barely wide enough to permit entry (40 to 50 cm), perhaps identifying them as sleeping areas where both privacy and warmth were the fundamental criteria. Many of the rooms at Tetimpa have hearths made from olla rims and stones set into their floors, but in some cases one of the lateral rooms has a daub-plastered quad- rangular stove built into the corner, just to the left of the entrance, and broken ollas strewn over the floor, providing solid evidence that these were kitchens.

Facade of a talud-tablero house platform (Unit 2) in Operation 2 at Tetimpa viewed from the east. A paired stela and altar (Feature 9) is located south of the staircase. and the patio, the more public spaces of the household, show important variations. More energy and materials were invested in the recep- tion areas of some residential compounds than others. Perhaps the differences between house- holds reflect administrative and ceremonial func- tions of the kin group or their socioeconomic status, rather than significant variations in family size. An interesting illustration of this can be seen at Operations 10 and 12. When we first excavated these two groups, we thought they were indepen- dent households because, although less than 10 m apart, each followed the basic rules for generating domestic space: a main platform flanked by one or two lateral rooms with a central shrine. However, Operation 10 (Figure 10) seemed aber- rant in several ways. First of all, it was very poorly constructed when compared to the pol- ished surfaces and straight lines of Operation 12. In addition, it had too many pots and too many cuexcomates for its size: there were over 10 ollas shattered on the floor of its tiny kitchen (Unit 3) plus several other vessels along the edges of the patio, while a total of five cuexcomates (Features 1, 4, 6, 7, and 8) lined the rim of the basal plat- form. At most other households we have found evidence of only two or three cuexcomates (for example, Features 5 and 6 at Operation 11 [Figure 8] and Features 2, 3, and 4 at Operation 2 [Figure 11]). Another telling feature was that at the center of Operation 10's patio there was only an uncar- ved stone marking the midpoint of the intersect- ing axes, instead of a shrine (Figure 10, Stone 1). The peculiarities we noted at Operation 10 sug- gest that this was not an independent household, but rather the kitchen and storage area of Operation 12 located a few meters to the south- west. Two other features seemed to link Operations 10 and 12. The most important was that at Operation 12 (Figure 12), the northeast comer of the patio had been formally marked with a diago- nal step made of andesite slabs that provided access to a corridor leading out of this compound, ending directly in front of the staircase of the 298 [Vol. 9, No. 4, 1998]</page><page sequence="13">REPORTS %.E^ *.UNIT I Fi j j _ A tBa -A - '[ [&gt;..- ' n . .

At this point, there was a circle of hardened daub, about 2.2 m in diameter that, because of its location, must have been used by the inhabitants of both Operations 10 and 12 (Figure 6). Based upon these observations, we suggest that Operation 10 and Operation 12 were two functionally separate parts of the same household, and that when the families of Tetimpa needed more space, they fol- lowed the basic spatial rules for the domestic environment by adding on another entire unit. In Operation 10, however, at the midpoint of the patio where other households affirmed their spir- itual identity with personalized shrines, there was only a blank, anonymous stone, signaling perhaps the subordinate position of this structural unit within a larger, more complex household. Size was not the only indicator of status differ- ences or ritual and civic specialization. The qual- ity of construction of some households, like Operations 2 and 12, was highly superior to that of others, such as Operations 4 or 11. At the first two, the floors were nicely polished, the buildings were symmetrical and well finished, ollas were placed on built-in pedestals rather than set directly on the patio floor, and corner spaces were converted into ground floor rooms rather than left open. Both Operations 2 and 12 also had indications of specialized activities that did not appear in other households. Resting against the wattle-and- daub wall of the ground-floor coner storage room at Operation 2 (Figure 11, Unit 5), we found a turtle-shell drum with a deer antler inside (Nos. 35 and 36) that was probably used in domestic rit- uals.

In addition, this room had a low interior bench built along the south wall; along its main facade, on either side of the doorway, were other built-in benches and an amphora rested upon one of these. We believe this structure may have been used either as a temazcal (sweatbath), or perhaps a spe- cial meeting room (Figure 13). At two house compounds we recovered the remains of architectural ornamentation from the facades of the center buildings. At Operation 2 the main platform was finished with symmetrical, U- shaped, recessed tableros flanking the central staircase, each framing a modeled-daub human face painted with yellow ochre and wearing a red turban. Underneath the tablero, two red-painted cords ran along the rim of the talud, intertwining beneath each face to form an intricate knot (Figure 14). Another example of modeled-daub decoration was documented at Operation 8. The 27 ... 0C O 2 FEATURE qS2 4 14 43,, 300 [Vol. 9, No. 4, 1998] 8, 11: -</page><page sequence="15">REPORTS Figure 12. Plan of house compound excavated at Operation 12 at Cruz Verde. upper portion of the platform had been badly damaged, but the alfardas were originally adorned with an elongated, undulating red figure, perhaps a serpent. Although in several houses the plain tableros still had vestiges of red paint, only Operations 2 and 8 provided any indication of high-relief decorations. The fact that the large, well-built house compound at Operation 12 did not have this kind of embellishment suggests that these features refer to more than just size and wealth; perhaps they are symbols of civic and cer- emonial distinctions. It may be coincidence, but we think it is probably significant that both exam- ples of architectural ornamentation were found in the Petlachica area. Domestic Ritual in the Terminal Preclassic Among the the most fascinating aspects of the houses at Tetimpa are the family cult areas located at the center of the patios. We recovered shrines from Operations 1(3), 2, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, and 12. At Operations 3, 8, and 9 the patio already had been excavated by the front-end loader or remains buried under layers of pumice. Although 301</page><page sequence="16">LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Figure 13. Operation 12: Northeast corner of the house compound with the temazcal or meeting room (Unit 4) built onto the north facade of the main platform viewed from the southwest. Note the diagonally placed stone slab step. none of the shrines are exactly the same and much individuality is apparent, there is some obvious thematic repetition. Apart from the plain stone marker at Operation 10, the simplest shrines con- sist of one or two crudely carved stones including images of snakes and felines. Although they now lie directly on the dirt floors of the patios, it is possible that they once rested upon wooden or wicker frames. The preservation of woody mate- rials in Late Tetimpa contexts, however, is gener- ally poor, and we have no solid evidence of this. At Operation 11 we found a low rectangular altar plastered with polished daub that had a plain stela of local andesite embedded in the eastern end (Figure 15). On top of the altar were two mortar- like stones and remains of fine gray ash indicating the use of burnt offerings or incense. Plain andesitic slab stelae apparently also were used at Teotihuacan in ritual contexts, perhaps as Soruco (1991) suggests, to mark the summer solstice. At Tetimpa plain stelae occur in various contexts and may not always imply ritual activity. For exam- ple, at both Operations 4 and 11 (Figure 8, Stone 4) stelae were found in association with cuexco- mates or grinding stones; at Operation 2 (Figure 9 and Figure 11, Feature 9) a paired stela and stone altar had been set directly in front of the talud of one of the platforms (Unit 2), probably a kitchen. Given the location of the site and the ultimate fate of the Late Tetimpa phase occupation, the most significant shrines were the effigy volcanoes found at Operations 2 and 12. In each case the artist sought to evoke the image of a smoking vol- cano, but there are important differences in the appearance of these two compositions and in the nature of the carved stones associated with them. The volcano effigy at Operation 2 (Figure 16) consisted of two miniature modeled platforms, or hills, each surmounted by an anthropomorphic carved stone head. Under each figure was a chim- ney (Figure 17), made from the inverted mouth- and-neck fragment of an olla, that led to a charcoal-filled chamber excavated into the patio floor (charcoal from one of these chambers pro- vided the I-17,814 '4C date). The figures faced south, towards the entrance to the compound, 302 [Vol. 9, No. 4, 1998]</page><page sequence="17">REPORTS Figure 14. Modeled daub figure in the recessed U-shaped tablero on the main fa2ade of the central platform (Unit 3) at Operation 2. while the volcano rises in the background to the southwest. The shrine measured only 80 cm long by 50 cm wide, while the height of the larger hill was just over 30 cm. The larger of the two carved stone heads is made from a porous light gray material and represents an individual with fur- rowed hair, round protruding eyes, and mouth and cheeks puffed in the act of blowing. The smaller figure is poorly sculpted from a dark gray lava, but his bug-eyes and the remains of red and yel- low pigments are readily apparent. Since we have found other examples of figures with these char- acteristics among the materials torn up by a front- end loader in a field adjoining Operation 2, among stones used to support a cuexcomate at Operation 6, and at the center of the patio in Operation 1(3), we conclude that both pieces rep- resent specific personages within the Late Tetimpa belief system (Plunket and Uruiiuela 1998c). The second volcano effigy shrine was discov- ered at Operation 12 in 1996 (Figure 18). This was a more elaborate version of a model volcano consisting of a rectangular basal altar, about 1.5 m long by 80 cm wide and 20 cm high, finished with polished daub. Set into the western end of the altar was a carefully carved stone head with bug- eyes, remains of red pigment, and a cap incised with a cross sign within a cartouche. On top of the altar was a smooth circular stone, crudely pecked to represent a human face, resting on a small ori- fice with no charcoal inside, although remains of gray ash were evident on the polished daub sur- face. At the eastern end of the altar, rising 20 cm above its surface, was a conical volcano effigy with a crudely carved stone serpent on top. Underneath this figure was a chimney formed from an olla rim that led to a specially made ceramic chamber. The carved images faced west, towards the Popocatepetl volcano that spectacu- larly dominates the horizon. Both of the volcano shrines are constructed so that smoke would have puffed out from under the carved figures in imitation of the ash and vapor plumes that are expelled from the volcano's crater during periods of activity.

Discussion There remains much to be done at Tetimpa, both in terms of exploration and analysis, but we can make some tentative observations and sugges- tions about household patterns during the Terminal Preclassic in central Mexico. First of all, the data demonstrate that domestic space was organized according to a standardized layout based on two intersecting axes, skewed 15? to 17? east of magnetic north. Buildings were centered on these axes, and shrines were located at their intersection. The basic unit could be replicated over and over so that households could be enlarged and new functions could be added according to the growing needs of each family group. It is possible that the cross incised within a cartouche on the cap of one of the carved figures of the altar at Operation 12 is a graphic manifes- tation of this cosmological concept. Our excavations of houses from the Early Tetimpa phase indicate that this domestic layout already existed by at least 400 B.C. Both of the houses we have excavated for this time period consist of three rooms placed at right angles around a central patio, although the dominance of the central room is perhaps not as pronounced as in Late Tetimpa times. These early houses proba- bly also used talud-tablero architectural profiles on their main facades. One of the major differ- ences between the two periods, however, has to do with the patio shrines. We have found no evi- dence of these at the Early Tetimpa houses, which instead have produced numerous examples of small modeled human figurines (Clear and 304 [Vol. 9, No. 4, 1998]</page><page sequence="19">REPORTS Figure 16. Volcano effigy shrine at Operation 2 viewed from the east. Shrine measures 80 cm long by 50 cm wide. Plunket 1996) typical of Middle and Late Preclassic occupations in central Mexico3; signif- icantly, figurines do not form part of the Late Tetimpa inventory. This suggests that one of the major changes between the Early and Late Tetimpa phases centers on the development of cult and ritual associated with mountains and the increasingly volatile nature of the Popocatepetl volcano. The basic household unit documented at Tetimpa is particularly important because it was probably the architectural pattern used for houses at other population centers in western Puebla, like Cholula, where unfortunately all of the buildings of this time period have either been destroyed or lie under 2,000 years of later occupation. In addi- tion, this architectural layout constitutes an important pattern at Teotihuacan where it proba- bly dates to the initial phases of the city (Cowgill 1996:329; Manzanilla et al. 1996: 246). Although most researchers associate it with the three-tem- ple ceremonial complexes, there has been little excavation of Patlachique and Tzacualli phase residential architecture that can provide informa- tion relevant to domestic spatial configurations. Millon (1973:51) has observed that Patlachique phase Teotihuacan consisted of clusters of small buildings separated by varying amounts of space, each perhaps related to a kin group, but Blucher's (1970) excavations at Tlachinolpan did not iden- tify any clear patterns. She did demonstrate conti- nuity between the Patlachique and Tzacualli phase constructions, and it is interesting to note that Structure 1 at Tlachinolpan probably occu- pied an area similar in size, about 130 m2 (Blucher 1970:108), to the smaller compounds at Tetimpa, although there are few data regarding the internal arrangement of this building. Since the tripartite building pattern based on intersecting perpendicular axes that divide space into four quarters is evident in early Teotihuacan ceremonial architecture (Cook de Leonard 1957; Paz 1996), and appears later as an element embed- ded in many apartment compounds (Manzanilla 305</page><page sequence="20">LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Figure 17. Chimney openings underneath the carved stone heads of the volcano effigy shrine at Operation 2. 1996: 242), the Tetimpa data suggest that this was a domestic organizational pattern that developed in the Late Preclassic and served as the basis for the increasingly complex and hierarchical struc- tures, both administrative and ceremonial, at the emerging urban centers of Cholula and Teotihuacan. Trade links between the Teotihuacan Valley and western Puebla can be demonstrated for the latter half of the Preclassic since almost all of the obsidian used by the settlement at Tetimpa comes from Otumba (Iceland and Albaitero 1996). Yet, it is not clear whether the residential pattern we have described here is Teotihuacan-derived, a Puebla phenomenon, or a characteristic common to both areas. We know little about household spa- tial organization for the Late and Terminal Preclassic in the Basin of Mexico (Manzanilla 1985; Serra Puche 1986) and from western Puebla, but the results of our explorations at Tetimpa will certainly provide important insights into this poorly understood time period. The intensive land use evident on the western slopes of the Popocatepetl volcano during the Terminal Preclassic suggests expanding popula- tions and perhaps increasing requirements by more demanding political structures associated with emerging urban communities. The house- holds of Tetimpa provide evidence for the devel- opment of new storage systems that are probably a consequence of the need for increased produc- tivity. In the Early Tetimpa houses storage was primarily subterranean, either in bell-shaped pits or in large ollas embedded in the patio floors, but during the Late, Tetimpa phase we have docu- mented a greater variety of storage systems including bell-shaped pits, partially underground roofed storage structures, and most significantly, the above-ground cuexcomates that can still be found in the more remote villages around the vol- cano. The experimentation involved in the devel- opment of new types of storage facilities evident in the Late Tetimpa phase may reflect new possi- bilities for the accumulation of wealth in a chang- ing political environment. And finally, we must at least briefly consider the impact of massive eruption of the Popocat6petl [Vol. 9, No. 4, 1998] 306</page><page sequence="21">REPORTS Figure 18. Volcano effigy shrine at Operation 12 viewed from the west. at the beginning of the present era. For Tetimpa, it was the end of the world, but for the surrounding regions we think that the major consequences involved population movements away from the western edge of the Puebla Valley, outside of the area of significant ash fall. Important Late Preclassic sites along the western edge of the Popocat6petl volcano, like Colotzingo (Uruniuela 1989) and San Francisco Coapa (Tschohl and Nickel 1972), show no signs of Classic period occupation and we suspect that they were largely abandoned after the volcanic disaster. We doubt that their populations went far, however, and it is quite possible that many refugees settled at Cholula, an emerging urban center safely beyond the limits of the airfall tephra from the plinian eruption (Panfil 1996:25). The refugees must have numbered in the thousands and this natural disaster perhaps provides at least a partial explanation for the population increase and subsequent massive building projects at Cholula (Marquina 1970). The volcanic eruption also must have had a significant ideological impact on the settlements of central Mexico, but it will take additional research, includ- ing more archaeological exploration at Cholula itself, to unravel this fascinating possibility. 307</page><page sequence="22">LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Acknowledgments.
