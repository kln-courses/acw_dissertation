<plain_text><page sequence="1">Liberal Theology for a Global World GRACE EDITH CAIRNS* P ROFESSOR NORTHROP in his recent book Logic of the Sciences and the Hu- manities discusses the need of the world for a global religion.1 He is strongly of the opinion that a religion which seeks to become global in character cannot base itself upon supernatural revelation, but instead must found itself upon a kind of truth and method of ascertaining it that can be open to, and ac- cepted by all men everywhere. He claims, rightly, that science and its method alone have given us this kind of truth; therefore, a global religion ought to found itself upon science and its method. Professor Northrop then goes on to point out the inadequacy of Christianity in both its Roman Catholic and Protestant forms because its theology is unscientific; and then he suggests at the end of his chapter on this subject a combination of what he calls the "theoretic component" of western science with the "aesthetic component" of Oriental mys- ticism as the basis for a global religion. Pro- fessor Northrop has done us a valuable service to remind us in these times of irrationalism, of fanaticism and dogmatism in religion and politics of the only approach to problems in these fields that can be universal or global, the rational or scientific approach. This paper, therefore, will be an attempt to sketch an out- line of a possible global theology based upon the implications of science and scientific method. Although most thinkers accept the results of scientific research as the most probable truth that we have, there are differing views of the meaning and of the implications of science and its method. It is the opinion of many philosophers that the best definition and most profound interpretation of science and its method and of all that is implied therein is given by Professors Morris R. Cohen and Ernest Nagel in their book on this subject, Logic and Scientific Method. Further interpre- tation is given throughout Professor Cohen's book Reason and Nature which discusses method and undertakes a critical examination of results in all of the sciences. Professors Cohen and Nagel have no theological precon- ceptions, nor are they concerned in the least with Hebrew or Christian apologetics. Yet they affirm that science depends for its very ex- istence upon logical relations in nature, and logical relations, moreover, that form a ra- tionally ordered system. In Logic and Scientific Method science is defined as "knowledge which is general and systematic, that is, in which specific propositions are all deduced from a few general principles."2 The relationship between the general propositions and the deduced sub- sidiary propositions is one of logical implica- tion. Since a science gives us the most certain knowledge we have of any area of inquiry, it is more probable than improbable that the sys- tematic logical relations that science discovers are objective in nature rather than convenient fictions of our own minds. Science implies, therefore, that logical relationships are realities in nature; if this were not true and nature were chaos, science would be impossible. Logical relationships are neither temporal nor spatial; they are eternal realities discovered, not created by us, in nature. As the simplest example to illustrate this let us take the law of falling bodies illustrated by an apple falling from a tree. The particular tree and the par- ticular apple are concrete, individual objects in time and space; they came into existence at a certain period in time and they will perish in time; but the law of falling bodies illus- trated by the falling of the apple from the tree is a mathematical or logical relationship which is always true in a certain given system. Logical relationships, therefore, are the eternal aspects * Assistant Professor in the Department of Phi- losophy and Religion of Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida. 106</page><page sequence="2">LIBERAL THEOLOGY FOR A GLOBAL WORLD 107 of our universe in so far as science reveals what is eternal. If we wish to base a theology upon science and scientific method, then we must look to the system of logical relations in nature for the foundation of our idea of God; for eternity is basic to such an idea. As Professor Northrop puts it, the "theoretic component" of reality which science is continuing to dis- cover can be the cornerstone for a global re- ligion because it can be accepted as a probable truth by anyone who respects science and its methods. However, whether or not this "theoretic component" is an organically integrated logical system we do not know. The idea would have normative value for science, since science at- tempts to systematize all of its propositions under a minimum of comprehensive theories; but at present we are far from being able to subsume all of the theories of the various sciences under one or two comprehensive ideas. In short, the sciences are relatively independ- ent of one another; for example, biology and psychology use different categories from those of physics. On the basis of our present scientific knowledge, we cannot see the universe as one coherent logical system. If we could, we should have absolute truth. Furthermore, it well may be true as Professor Morris R. Cohen argues, that if all were rational, then the rational or logical would have no meaning. The rational can only be real and distinguishable over against the irrational; or to put it in another way, relational forms are unreal apart from terms that they relate. In actuality, science has not succeeded in reducing everything to logic or systematic patterns of relationship. Logic does not exhaust existence, although it is the knowable and the eternal element in existence. This "reason" in nature which our minds have discovered and are continuing to discover ex- cites our reverential awe, wonder, and humility if we are at all sensitive intellectually; and most of us are or can be if we are made aware of the wonders that science reveals. This theo- retical component of reality can be the only basis in science for the hypothesis of a super- human "intelligence" in nature, though to call it "God," in the usual sense of the word, is to give it personal and anthropomorphic conno- tations that are misleading. The obvious and popular criticism of such a view of divine reality is that it is too abstract, lifeless, or cold ever to appeal to any group of people. On the contrary the abstract when properly understood is far from colorless. As F. H. Bradley, in his book, Appearance and Reality, points out, the most interesting things in the universe, including our precious selves, can be shown to be abstractions. Furthermore, such a view of divine reality would have the appeal of having a foundation in scientific truth which cannot be said of present day Western Christianity. If Christianity is crum- bling today, it is because its theology is not grounded in the accepted universe of truth, the scientific universe; so better what is popu- larly called an abstract or colorless reality that has truth than a vivid, sensuous, romantic one that is largely a fiction of imagination and wish-belief. The East would be better prepared to ac- cept such an idea of the divine than the West because its sages have long been familiar with the idea of an impersonal absolute. Howev-r, their mode of becoming acquainted with this absolute, mystical intutition, is, of course, un- scientific. If Nehru of India can be taken as the forerunner of a new Eastern scientific approach to the universe, it seems that the East is rapidly awakening to the values of science and scientific method. Thus the ground- work is being laid of a common, global basis for a universally understood religion based upon science and its method. But could the Russian Communists have respect for such an idea of divine reality? It is true that the Communists are irrational fa- natics in their dogmatic belief in the economic interpretation of man and history. However, even for the Communists, there is logic in history and nature although it is wrongly con- ceived of in materialistic terms. The Com- munists would be more accurate in their ter- minology if they called their logic impersonal rather than material; for logical relations are</page><page sequence="3">108 GRACE EDITH CAIRNS nonmaterial abstractions. The idea of an im- personal logic in nature, human nature, and human history would not be foreign to their thought; whereas they have no difficulty in showing those who have not been emotionally conditioned to Christianity the absurdity of its ideas of a God of love who takes care of everybody when all the starved children of Europe felt no such reality during the recent war and its aftermath. The Chinese and Indian children for a long time have felt no such reality. But if we adopted an idea of divine reality based upon reason, upon science and its method, even the Communists might one day, despite their Marxian Bible, be converted. In any case, they could not truly say that our religion was unscientific or irrational. In proposing that we accept as the divine reality the logical structure of nature, what would become of human values such as love, truth, beauty, and the good, and what of the immortality of the soul? Love would retain its present value, for it is the basis of the social coiperation which is more than ever needed today in a global world where the atomic bomb threatens to destroy us if hate and unreason prevail. Truth is the ideal of science and its method and would remain a supreme value. Beauty depends for its existence upon harmo- nious relationships, so it, too, is grounded in logical structure; and the good is the har- monious, the beautiful, and rational in all re- lationships, personal and impersonal. All of these values are values for man, al- though grounded in the divine reality which is the theoretical component of the universe. It is man who loves and appreciates truth and has a conscious awareness of it because he alone knows error and falsehood; it is man alone who loves and worships beauty in so far as we have sufficient evidence; for conscious thought and feeling are necessary to appreciate the significance of great beauty; and here again our appreciation, which often amounts to re- ligious worship would be impossible if it were not for our human awareness of the inhar- monious, the vulgar, the hideous. The good, also, is primarily a value for man. Isaiah, the great Hebrew prophet, attributed this quality to his god, Yahweh. Since Yahweh was considered a personal deity, Isaiah must have felt, in the experience of God which he describes, as if he were confronted with a being possessed of all the greatest human spiritual qualities imaginable and in the most superl- ative degree. Naturally, the imagery of his vision was peculiar to the mythology of his time, but his experience of awe and reverence in being, as he thought, face to face with the greatest conceivable spiritual values has been felt and relived in all of its intensity by many of the great mystics, and in lesser degree in contemplative prayer by all religious persons. As Plato said long ago, the idea of the good is the sun and the glory of the spiritual world. It is truth and beauty and the holy light of inspiration that draws finite creatures towards an infinite goal. Truth, beauty, and the good are, then, values for finite human creatures, but have their objective foundations in the logical structure of the universe. The final problem to face in our theology is that of the nature of man and of his soul. It would follow from our view of the reality of logical relations in nature, that the rational aspect of nature is self-conscious in man if nowhere else, and that man is the highest in- carnation, to use a Christian theological term, of the reason-in-nature. In a limited sense, man can say as Hegel said, "I am the Absolute." There is in man a perfectly rational basis for his noetic mystical intuitions that he is one with an all-inclusive reality or reason. Man is eternal in the sense that he comprehends that which is eternal and can, if he desires, con- sciously identify himself with the eternal. He does not need to wait for death to become eter- nal in this sense. But he is eternal, also, in another sense. The existentialists have truth in their view that in man existence precedes essence, or in other words, man defines his essence in existence. Certainly man does not have the kind of radical freedom to define his own essence that the existentialists claim, since he is born with some traits and his environ-</page><page sequence="4">LIBERAL THEOLOGY FOR A GLOBAL WORLD 109 ment determines others; yet it is true that man, so far as is known at present, can in large measure develop his character or essence during his life period, and it is this character or essence which is immortal and eternal. George Santayana gives beautiful expression to this view of immortality in his introduction to the Ethics of Spinoza. He writes: A man who understands himself under the form of eternity knows the quality that eternally belongs to him, and knows that he cannot wholly die, even if he would; for when the movement of his life is over, the truth of his life remains. The fact of him is a part forever of the infinite context of facts. This sort of immortality belongs passively to everything; but to the intellectual part of man it belongs actively also, because, in so far as it knows the eternity of truth, and is absorbed in it, the mind lives in that eternity.3 REFERENCES 1 F.
