<plain_text><page sequence="1">A SCRUTINY OF THE CHARGES OF FORGERY AGAINST MAIMONIDES' "LETTER ON RESURRECTION" By ISAIAH SONNE Shortly before the big controversy about the Dead Sea Scrolls arose, an attempt was made to stigmatize as forgeries certain writings attributed to Maimonides. The main target of the forgery attack was "The Letter on Resurrection" - Iggeret Tehiyat ha-Metim. In 1944 Dr. Teicher published a sensational article "Maimonides' Treatise on Resurrection - a 13th Century Forgery."' Since some of Maimonides' letters refer to this treatise, those too were drawn into the realm of fabrications. Indeed, a few years later, 1948, another startling article by Teicher appeared proclaiming: "Maimonides' Letter to Joseph ben Jehudah a literary Forgery."2 Controversy over the Dead Sea Scrolls eclipsed for the time being the forgery chal- lenge of the "Treatise." Unlike the Scrolls, however, which have found a host of scholars ready to defend them against the charge that they are not authentic, none, to my knowledge, took up the defense of the "Treatise." The few scholars who took cognizance of the sensational discovery were rather captivated by its "novelty," and, without taking the least trouble to examine the evidence, Teicher, Jacob L., 'nvni , nw o,n,r n"nn -nnND :"'r ntN 'nln,D ll', Melilah, I (1944), p. 81-92. Will be quoted: Melilah. 2Teicher, Jacob L., Maimonides' Letter to Joseph ben Jehudah - a Literary Forgery, Journal of Jewish Studies, I (1948), pp. 35-54. Will be quoted JJS. Endowed, as it seems, with a special scent for forgeries, Teicher tells us that "there is no doubt this letter (of Maimonides to Ibn Gabar) is not genuine" (JJS, p. 49, note 1). He also suspects as spurious the "Yad Ramah," novellae on Tractate Baba Batra, attributed to Meir Abulafia as well as the "Torath ha-Adam," attributed to Nahmanides, because both cite the "Treatise" (Melilah, p. 92). 101</page><page sequence="2">were inclined to accept, with certain qualifications, the forgery theory as plausible.3 This lack of interest in defending the "Treatise" is understandable, though hardly justified. After all, we may say, the incriminated treatise and letters are not that important, and Maimonides' achievements would hardly be affected if we should be compelled to remove the above men- tioned writings from the list of his works. However, the scholars seem to overlook that not only the "Treatise" is at stake, but, what is more important, the reputation of so many students who, according to Teicher, were fooled for more than half a millennium by a clumsy falsification which he "at once" recog- nized as such. This assertion stirred my curiosity to learn the technique and the tools by which Teicher was able to unmask the forger who for more than five hundred years succeeded so well in deceiving the best critical minds of Jewish scholarship. I therefore decided to subject to a critical analysis the evidence adduced by Dr. Teicher to impugn the authenticity of the "Treatise on Resurrection." Here are the findings of this analysis. Formally the evidence runs as follows: 1) A certain argument dealt with in the "Treatise" could not have been known to Maimonides, because Teicher asserts he knows positively that the first to formulate such argument was no other than Meir Abulafia in his anti-Maimonidean campaign. Ergo it must be post-Maimonides. 2) A statement in the "Treatise" about the corporeal conception of God as current among Jewish rabbis does not, according to Teicher, fit into the Jewish cultural climate of the time of Maimonides, but rather in that of the end of the 13th century. Ergo it is a product of the second half of this century. 3) Finally, the "Treatise" raises a "strange" 3 In his review of the Melilah volume (Hatekufah, vol. 30-31 (1946), p. 823-27), Prof. Baron singles out Teicher's article as the most interesting and the most "acute" of the whole volume. In justice to Prof. Baron, it must be added that he reserved his final judgment until Teicher would produce his promised, extensive study on the subject. To my knowledge, he has not yet fulfilled his promise, and if I rightly understand his words in JJS, p. 42: "I have shown elsewhere that the Treatise is a forgery," Teicher considers his conclusion as definite, and any further investigation a waste of time. 102 [2] SONNE</page><page sequence="3">[3] MAIMONIDES' "LETTER ON RESURRECTION' question the answer to which is, according to Teicher, absurd, and reveals the ignorance of the author. Ergo he could not be Maimonides. Scholars who have followed attentively the discussion about the Scrolls will not fail to realize that we are here in the presence of a familiar scientific temper, impatient of doubts and un- certainties and precipitating conclusions "without a shade of doubt." Indeed, arguments of the same character and weight, presented with the same air of definiteness, are not rare in the great debate about the Scrolls, and we meet them often in both opposing camps. A scrutiny of the logical structure as well as the very premises of Teicher's theory may disclose the pitfalls of such scientific audacities, and admonish us to a more cautious and patient procedure in our research work. I First Proof. The first passage which Teicher singles out as bearing post-Maimonidean traces reads: "We also made it clear there (referring to his Mishneh Torah) that there will be no human bodies in the world to come, since our teachers said that there will be no eating no drinking etc. It is therefore un- thinkable that these bodily organs should exist devoid of any purpose, any function. Far be it from God to act without a pur- pose (in vain)." The treatise continues: "Some one has refuted this our statement, saying: 'Behold, Moses and Elijah have lived for a long time without food though endowed with human bodies. The people of the world to come may be of the same nature'." To this argument, Maimonides replies with an ex- clamation: What a comparison!4 The bodily organs of Moses and Elijah were not devoid of a purpose. Both of them were human beings participating in the affairs of this world; they ate and drank with these organs before the miracle and afterwards. How can you compare this with a continuous, eternal existence 4 The exclamation is rendered by Lam. 1.12: iln;t n -nr iy ,i: D0' SK Ki .... 1K:1. 103</page><page sequence="4">104 SONNE [4] as that of the hereafter? How can there be bodily organs ful- filling no function at any time? These people (who maintain the existence of the body in the hereafter) do not know the great blasphemy one commits by attributing a purposeless act to God."s Referring to an exchange of letters touching upon our subject, between the anti-Maimonidean Meir Abulafia and the Mai- monidean Nasi Sheshet of Saragossa, Teicher contends a) that Meir Abulafia was the first to have used the Moses and Elijah example in support of the existence of the body in the here- after; b) that the reply to this argument in the "Treatise" originated with the Nasi Sheshet of Saragossa. Teicher then goes on to say c) that "comparing the text of the "Treatise" with that of the two epistles, we see at once that there exists a re- lationship of direct dependence, and d) precisely that the "Treatise" is dependent on the epistles and not vice versa."6 The first three statements are simply introduced as self evident. Are they really self evident? We start our investiga- tion with the central statement, namely that of the direct dependence of the two texts, our "Treatise" and the Abulafia- Sheshet correspondence, because the whole structure stands or 5 Maimonides' Treatise on Resurrection, ed.

This statement clearly implies that the passages under consideration in the two texts, are, as far as the content is concerned, identical, expressing the same ideas. This supposi- tion, however, is entirely gratuitous, and hardly does justice to the text of the "Treatise." As a matter of fact, on closer con- sideration it becomes clear that the two texts, especially with regard to the reply, have very little in common. We should bear in mind that if we read the "Treatise" with due attention as a genuine Maimonidean work, and do not look upon it contemptuously as a spurious one, we cannot fail to realize that the center of gravity of its argumentation lies in the teleological concept - not of nature as formulated by Aristotle, but-of the works of God.7 Again and again the "Treatise" stresses that it would be blasphemous to attribute to God a purposeless act, and therefore it is impossible to con- ceive that God should have created bodily organs of digestion, for instance, for such human beings as those of the hereafter who would never use them.8 Should we find that this central 7 Moreh Nebukim, III, chap. 25: nlmlys ni3w 'nn1 ~I Wyn9 -VWK Nw -nDlK . .. in 3i p,n on. Finkel in his "Explanatory Notes," p. 94, note 9, refers to Moreh II, chap. 14 where Maimonides quotes Aristotle saying: ozn ymun rnh= n3'i nvpy' i1. However, Maimonides seems to have purposely avoided here any allusion to Aristotle. True, in the Moreh, he links his theological concept of purpose with Aristotle's naturalistic view, but here, writing for the common people (Treatise, p. 37: ... 11.n ln,nnn mDK inDwon nr), Maimonides preferred to remain on strictly theological ground. 8 Not only in the above quoted passage, but still more in ##24, 25 (pp. 16-18), Maimonides went out of his way to expatiate on this point: niK' iix 1i9 9lprw Nnit4 znn '- 3 1n)n ... t2l nllyB7 O D'9D N1 KIn ODl p7rnw nr -nny-11 l3 m1n 1] OK ... *nIn n-nn1 llrDn n~Mp 'm nnM nl,f n u 'D Inin,o K N KN2 nI i y K I n ; D1 a -13 K 8 X'2 DD' K -1 n' Ki n , ; in ni7iyBP ni3pinDn ,lni^lyD9 In t Dnl 1i t n;n n -in1 -i D on ' in nls nI Bi nI-I I ]o ...l ?rg ' I . y ...n1 mD 01 W K1 1 ? 1 I -I I l K In - ; 13 0 I n l W K. t It is significant that Nahmanides who was very well versed in the old con- troversy quotes only this teleological argument from our Treatise (cf.

Let us now examine carefully from this angle the correspond- ing passages in the epistles. Abulafia's objection reads: "Should any one ask how could a human body exist without eating and drinking..." (to this we reply): "He who created the body out of nothing... can also sustain and keep it alive without food and drink. Did not Moses stay on the Mountain of the Lord for forty days and forty nights without nourishment?... The same is true of Elijah . . ."9 Thus far the parallelism of the two texts appears obvious. But as soon as we pass to the reply of Nasi Sheshet we cannot fail to realize that he is pursuing a direction entirely different from the "Treatise." "We should not wonder," says Nasi Sheshet, "if Moses, while on the Mountain of the Lord and enjoying the divine glory, could forgo food for a certain number of days. A man like Moses, who while still alive was almost a divine angel .. and could have lived all his life without food and drink, could hardly be adduced as proof for other people. How much less so, since he really refrained from nourishment only as long as he was on the Mountain enjoying the splendor of the Shekhinah, while all the rest of his life Moses ate and drank like all the other people endowed with a body..., because this is the nature which God has im- planted in man from the day of creation, namely to sustain his breath and body with food until the soul shall depart from the body. Then the latter will return to the earth and be dissolved into the elements of which it was created.. ."Io We have tried 9 fitdb Al-Rasd'il, ed.

But whatever we may think of Sheshet's argumentation, no one could detect in it the slightest notion of the teleological principle which, as we have seen, constitutes the very nerve of the discussion in the "Treatise," nor is there any awareness of this principle in Abulafia's letter. It is therefore safe to assert that there is no direct connection between our "Treatise" and Nasi Sheshet's letter, because they follow different trains of thought. True, Dr. Teicher let Abulafia introduce Moses and Elijah as proof "that the organs of the body will not be purposeless (in vain) even in the hereafter."12 Unfortunately, Teicher's con- tempt of mediaeval Hebrew texts, which is reflected in the levity with which he condemns them as forgeries, caused him un- wittingly to commit a certain kind of forgery, namely, to twist Abulafia's words completely out of their obvious meaning, and let him say something which makes no sense. Indeed, how on earth could the fact of Moses living without food for 40 days prove that the bodily organs would not be purposeless (in vain) in the hereafter? The truth of the matter is that the teleological premise of the "Treatise," the question of purpose, is entirely absent in Abulafia's mind and letter, and was introduced there thoughtlessly, because of his gratuitous assumption of the identity of the two texts. How about Teicher's other self-evident statement, namely that Abulafia was the first to refer to Moses and Elijah as models of bodily life in the hereafter? This too is a hasty, un- warranted assertion. He seems to have overlooked the simple fact that the controversy over the existence of the bodily organs in the hereafter did not originate with the anti-Maimonidean polemics, but was already hotly debated at the time of Saadia " Cf. above, note 6. 12 Cf. 1pan I -.I n1 'r' oo nnlw swn ...1 nion -v n' y'iznK nHn .. . 3 v , 1 m 3 1 3' 9 K n 9 v 91 ' n1' i. 107</page><page sequence="8">108 SONNE [8] Gaon, and could probably he traced back to a still earlier period.'3 Had Teicher given thought to the pre-Maimonidean phase of the controversy, he would have found the Moses- Elijah theme already treated by Saadia Gaon. Indeed, one of the popular arguments against the bodily existence in the here- after is recorded by Saadia Gaon and reads as follows: "Should any one say: if the nature and constitution of the people in the hereafter should be the same as that of the people of this world who are eating and drinking, how could they live in a place where there is no food no water? We reply: "They will live without food and without water in the same manner as Moses lived forty days and forty nights, all the time retaining his usual human nature.'4 Here we have the source of Abulafia's position in this question. As a matter of fact, in his letter to Aaron ben Meshullam, Abulafia flatly boasts that he was draw- ing upon the "earlier sages" and was only repeating Saadia Gaon's arguments.'5 The Moses-Elijah argument must have been very popular at the time of Maimonides, since we find a reference to it in the "Objections" (Hassagot) of his older con- temporary opponent, R. Abraham ben David of Posquie"res,'6 and was almost certainly well known to Maimonides. 'I Cf. Aaron ben Meshullam's Letter to Abulafia in Kitdb Al-Rasl'il, p. 36: 1' 7 I 7 1 3' 2 1 wrlmn ci1 ci ...

The point of departure for both of them is Maimonides' statement in his Mishneh Torah where the purely spiritual existence in the world to come is expressed in the following terms: "It therefore has been proved that there shall be no corporeal body in the world to come, since there will be no eating nor drinking."17 The followers of the orthodox view believed they heard an echo of the familiar argument dealt with by Saadia Gaon, namely, that it would be impossible for the body to subsist without nourish- ment. The rejection of this argument by adducing the sample of Moses and Elijah as proof that the human body can subsist without food, was furnished to them by Saadia Gaon, and they did not hesitate to reecho his words. The Maimonideans on the other hand endeavored to stress the difference between the case of Moses and that of the life hereafter pointing out either the temporary character of the former or the exceptional, angel- like nature of Moses.'8 Whether this rejoinder was a new element introduced into the old discussion, I am unable to ascertain, but I am rather inclined to consider Sheshet's reply too as a mere echo of the old controversy. Maimonides himself at first was resolved to refrain from participating in the revived dispute about the nature of the life in the hereafter.19 Later, however, pressed by his admirers in Yemen, he decided to clarify his statement in the Mishneh Torah. He revealed to them that his argument there was mis- understood, and was by no means identical with that invoked by Saadia Gaon. Indeed, it was not the assumption of the im- possibility of the body to subsist without nourishment that led him to the negation of the body in the hereafter, but rather the inadmissibility of conceiving God as creating something in vain, without a purposeful function, - as the creation of organs of I7 Ibid., Maimonides: Dm'3WKmln 'n 1Dn 1n:3 ,n 'al 1lz 1, 1' Hnl DIlyn; ' 3 ~ = 1 D 1'w ' X 'n n ~1 nn : n ... ,nnv 1 ;i ' Hi' 1 : -in ,'mS ~ 3 n l'ntWl n 'S DW 1'NW.

It is clear that Saadia's reference to Moses and Elijah, repeated by RaBaD and Abulafia, could hardly be applied to the new turn given by Maimonides to the old argu- ment, and he rightly could exclaim: "Lo Alekem..." What a comparison! The final result of our analysis of the first proof has shown: a) That Abulafia was definitely not the first to introduce the Moses-Elijah theme into the discussion about the bodily ex- istence in the hereafter; b) That Nasi Sheshet's defence against the Moses-Elijah argument has little, if any thing, to do with the reply in the "Treatise on Resurrection;" c) Finally, that the "Treatise" introduces a new angle, that of the teleological con- cept of the divine acts, into the controversy, an angle which unmistakably bears Maimonides' stamp. II Second Proof. We now pass to the second demonstration which deserves special attention, because it is based upon one of Teicher's "revolutionary" discoveries which we will have to deal with. The proof reads as follows: "As a second proof that the "Treatise" is a forgery I refer to a passage from p. 3, #4, ed. Finkel.20 There Maimonides allegedly asserts that he was prompted to insert in his talmudic works also the articles of faith, among them that God is incorporeal, because some people from many countries he met asserted that God is a corporeal being, and they considered as atheist whoever maintained the opposite, calling him heretic and Epicurean." In vain (exclaims Teicher) will we search in all the other works of Maimonides for the slightest hint of what is told here about Jews in Mai- monides' time who considered as heretics those who denied the corporeity of God, and that it is against them that he composed 20 Ibid.: n113 ip',rnl 1pa Kmnv 'D 13 ,D9m niplY nxp ,'mDP 'nnan ,'lnl m0DS .'.

But supposing for a moment that there really is no other statement to this effect in Maimonides' works, does this prove that Maimonides could not have asserted it in the "Treatise"? Is this a sufficient ground to suspect forgery, let alone to declare it categorically? But Teicher did not stop here; he advances his Copernican discovery, namely a) That in Maimonides' time there was no Jewish scholar who believed that God has a human form; b) That such a belief crept into the Jewish world in the thir- teenth century under the influence of the Christian reaction.22 We of the old school were sufficiently simple-minded to trust Jedaja ha-Penini who in his "Apologetic Pamphlet" assures us that one of Maimonides' greatest merits consisted in having succeeded in eradicating the rude anthropomorphism widely spread in his time, and that it almost vanished by the end of the thirteenth century.23 Quite the contrary is true, we are now told, the anthropomorphic concept of God is the very product of the thirteenth century. Indeed, what weight could Teicher give to the testimony of the biased Jedaja who, for all Teicher knows, might have been an accomplice of the forgery work per- petrated at that time by the French Maimonideans. However, Teicher owes us an explanation of why he ignored the testimony of Maimonides' contemporary opponent, R. Abraham ben David of Posqui6res (RaBaD, d. 1193) who in his objections (Hassagot) to the Mishneh Torah rebukes Maimonides for the inclusion of those who believe in a corporeal God in the category of heretics 2 1Melilah, p. 84: 6np Nnn 'ZDD1 'gm, OrmMl6tonn,-D 'i n I-Y3 My i6 K1"T mvl' J'DO &amp;?tr?

He is convinced that "no Jew could have conceived God in a human form," and that Maimonides' polemic was directed against Christians with reference to the dogma of incarnation which they derive from the above mentioned verse (Gen. 1.26), "as can be seen in Thomas of Aquino" (!).27 For once Teicher is in good com- pany. The famous, versatile Menasseh ben Israel already in the 17. century substituted "many among the non-Jewish scholars" for "the sons of man" - the people - in the passage under discussion.28 Yet there are more reliable instances than Menasseh ben Israel and Thomas of Aquino to determine who were the people Maimonides referred to. A very pertinent instance is the following passage of Ibn Daud's Emunah Ramah: "Know that some ignorant people among our nation are confused and perplexed regarding the meaning of the divine words (Gen. 1.26): 'Let us make man in 24 Mishneh Torah, I, Tesh., 3, #5: ~yzi 'p) mri n tiN ~ -imm jin o' vrv' -=wni ita lzL~n 13m P'3ltll 0 ' ~ 1 '11 ; 9 z 1 I'D nr~ b H`13 ;TD,1 .0 -I - nt4 -1 n t .-.Innn nirn n 8 n7vlZ7Dr 1 F ni7)frrn -in-i ibtfl8 nvn -i1 niwtp- ThI?V i w 'Dm7 D IV awnn; .

Now in the opinion of the masses the form means the body... Consequently they assume that this verse compels us to conceive God as being constituted of the same matter and the same form as man. And for this reason they have fallen into a grave error. Indeed, the nations opposed to our faith accuse us of anthropomorphism."'9 In another passage Ibn Daud does not hesitate to point out that Christians have a purer, more spiritual, concept of God than the "ignorants of our nation."30 A candid reader cannot help interpreting Maimonides' bene ddam as a euphonic rendering of Ibn Daud's sikhle umatenui - the ignorants of our nation. Furthermore, there seems to be some intrinsic evidence that Maimonides refers to just these "ignorants of our nation." Con- tinuing, Maimonides says as follows: "They thought that He has the stature and figure of a man, and therefore asserted a flat corporeity of God, because they imagined that should they divorce themselves from this belief, they would have to deny the Scripture. They would also consider God as non-existent if He did not have a body like theirs... with the only distinction that He is much bigger and brighter, and that his body does not consist of flesh and blood."3a Does this description fit the Chris- tian dogma of incarnation? Maybe Teicher will be able to produce some evidence to this effect from Thomas of Aquino, or he may explain that Maimonides had in mind those Christian heretics who say that "the Holy Ghost does not dwell in the flesh and blood of Jesus."32 29 Emunah Ramah, ed.

Do not all signs point rather to the circles close to the Shiur .Fomdh specu- lations? As a matter of fact, there you will find God described as a human figure with human organs of immense dimensions ("bigger") whose body is (not of flesh and blood, but) like the beryl irradiating tremendous splendor ("brighter").33 This will appear still more convincing if we bear in mind Maimonides' condemnation of the Shiur Komah and its followers. Indeed, asked what he thought of the Shiur I?omdh and its origin, Maimonides replied as follows: "I do not think it to be a work of our sages. God forbid that something of this sort should be composed by them. It is rather a composition of popular preachers coming from Greece (meaning Christian countries). The elimination of the book and its content is highly com- mendable, as it is written "Make no mention of the name of other gods (Ex. 23.13);" a substance which has a stature is surely another god."34 The same group is, in all probability, alluded to in Ibn Daud's attack against the "ignorants of our nation" mentioned above. This would account for Ibn Daud's statement that they are responsible for the accusation of anthropomorphism raised by the other nations against Judaism. It is a well known fact that already in the tenth century Shiur Iojmdh and cognate com- positions offered the Karaites an occasion to launch violent accusations of crude anthropomorphism against the Rabbanites. Beginning with the twelfth century these accusations were seized upon by the Christian polemicists, and have ever since remained an integral part of Christian-Jewish disputation.35 We 33 H31i p',nD iln rt'nnr rnim, Salmon ben Yeruhim, 'n mDnin, ed.

One final remark. It seems that Teicher has searched in vain, as he admits, all other works of Maimonides except the one he should have looked for in the first place. Indeed, in the "Treatise" Maimonides indicates expressly "his talmudic works" where his articles of faith are inserted. This is a clear reference to his Mishnah Commentary (Sanh. 10.1).36 Had Teicher followed this direction, he would have found more than an allusion to the statement in the "Treatise." The following passage will suffice: "Among the things you ought to know is that with regard to the (aggadic) words of the sages, people are divided into three factions. The followers of the first faction - they constitute the majority of the teachers I met or whose works I saw- hold to their literal sense... They divulge certain sayings which, taken literally, cause the other nations, to exclaim: 'This little nation is a foolish and ignorant people'."37 Here again we have an unmistakable allusion to the accusations of anthropomorphism levelled against certain aggadic sayings as well as against the Shiur lomdh speculations by other na- tions, Christians, Moslems and Karaites. Add to all this the fact that the followers of this faction are designated by Maimonides as "popular preachers"38 to whom, as we have seen, Maimonides attributes the composition of the Shiur Ko.mdh, and it becomes quite clear that the "Jewish Baer in his essay on Abner of Burgos (Korespondenzblatt, 1929) and in his "History of the Jews in Spain" (Hebr.).

Summing up the results of the analysis of the second proof, it appears: a) That at the time of Maimonides among Jewish teachers, especially those under Byzantine and Gothic influence, there were widespread circles adhering to a crude anthropo- morphism of the Shiur Komdh; b) That it was this group of the "ignorants of our nation," and not the Christian dogma of incarnation, that prompted Maimonides to insist with special emphasis on the incorporeity of God; c) That Maimonides made this clear not only in the "Treatise," but also in the Mishnah Commentary as well as in the Moreh Nebukim. III Third Proof. There is no need of an analytical investigation of this proof which Teicher added only for the fun "of having a threefold cord,"39 and which we may term as demonstratio ignorantiae, a favored pastime of certain omniscient scholars; it hardly can be taken seriously. Indeed, it required a good deal of Teicher's skill to turn the plain question: "Why is resurrection not mentioned in the Torah," into a "strange problem": "Why did the Lord tarry so long to announce the miracle of resurrection to the congregation of Israel ... ,"40 and still more skill was needed to transform the simple answer to this plain question into an "absurd" philosophical conception of "religious progress." But even in this presentation, no one will be justified in draw- ing the conclusion that the "Treatise" is a forgery. For by the same token one could prove that the Moreh Nebukim and the Yad-Ha-I.azakah are forgeries. There are enough passages in both works which present serious difficulties and apparent ab- 39 Melilah, p. 86: w5i vln i Inlry mnlnN nK n,rIt -3. 40 Cf.

Yet it did not occur to any one of the great host of authors that there is an easy way to dispose of all the difficulties by one radical surgery act, namely by removing the book from the genuine works of Maimonides, and declaring it as spurious. There would not be very much left. The truth of the matter is that the demonstratio ignorantiae is a double-edged sword; it may indicate the ignorance of the author, but it may also indicate our own ignorance. Unfor- tunately, Teicher did not take into consideration the possibility that, while he was soaring in the philosophical realm of religious progress, he might have failed to grasp the meaning of the "Treatise" for its very simplicity, as befits a letter addressed not to philosophers, but to common people, yes to "women and ignorants." As a matter of fact, the passage under consideration does not seem to have ever caused any trouble to the students dealing with the "Treatise." The recent editor, J. Finkel, renders it in a homely way that makes quite good sense,4I although it might not meet the requirements of philosophical depth and precision expected of Maimonides, the great thinker. However, we should bear in mind that Maimonides himself stressed the fact that in the "Treatise" he was speaking to the common man, and that he strove to adapt himself to the mentality of "women and ignorants" in order that they might understand him. At the end of our analytical endeavor, may we be allowed to urge the younger, high-spirited scholars to treat old texts with more respect, and, in case they happen to run into unsolvable difficulties, they will do well to follow rather the advice of the old teachers: 1l'Y 1'in "There is need for further investigation, than the fashionable slogan: nlyn 1'n'i: "It should be elimi- nated," removed." 4I Treatise, Finkel, Engl.
