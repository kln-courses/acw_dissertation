<plain_text><page sequence="1">Tennyson's Idylls of the King as Tragic Drama HENRY KOZICKI ^pRAGIC vision is often denied Tennyson. Baum sees in his plays ■*• no genuine dramatic instinct and, as for the Idylls, if it "will not bear scrutiny as story, and if as allegory it shows signs of inco- herence and confusion, what remains?"1 Certainly not tragedy. "There is no Tennyson tragedy," Arthur J. Carr says flatly, "The themes of frustration can scarcely amount to that, and the tragic order of values is lacking."2 F. E. L. Priestly observes that the Idylls falls "naturally into three groups of four, corresponding closely to the three acts of modern drama," an arrangement whose "total dramatic effect seems to me to have considerable power," but its real nature still "is essential- ly that of dramatic allegory."3 Jerome H. Buckley says of the Idylls that "the unity of the sequence lies not in action or plot but in theme, imagery, and atmosphere,"4 yet that "the tragedy of the Idylls is built cumulatively in the separate episodes or panels" (p. 187) "somewhat like Troilus to a tragic denouement" (p. 193). Here is an implication of tragic content but, by noting that Troilus and Cressida is "bitter," Buckley appears to accept the Idylls, in E. D. H. Johnson's phrase, as "ultimate dissolution into chaos"5 and to repudiate Tillyard's view of Troilus that "the old interpretation of the play as an outburst of unrestrained bitterness against life, to be overcome later, is fantas- tically false."6 Can the tragic vision, then, contain, in the world of the Idylls, merely a picture of the "cultural decadence" Buckley sees attending a "gradual catastrophic betrayal of its sustaining idealism" (p. 193)? I think not. The question of Tennyson's tragic vision and of the Idylls as tragic drama must rest on some definition of tragedy. Richmond Y. Hathorn defines tragedy as "a work of literature which has as its chief emphasis the revelation of mystery,"7 mystery being the relation- 1 Paull F.

It is mystery because the very effort to objectify the tragic situation, to withdraw and observe, nullifies the observation, for "the observer of the pattern is part of the pattern himself and his tragic knowledge is "awareness of the pattern of justice" (Hathorn, pp. 30, 221). "Tragic courage adds to the per- ception of the pattern the acceptance of its Tightness, even as it involves oneself: 'a terrible beauty is born,' we may say with Yeats" (Hathorn, p. 222). Hathorn quotes Gabriel Marcel in regard to tragic involvement: "evil which is only stated or observed is no longer evil which is suffered: in fact, it ceases to be evil. In reality, I can only grasp it as evil in the measure in which it touches me- that is to say, in the measure in which I am involved" ( Hathorn, p. 18 ). The Idylls is tragic drama for such reasons, that its personages accept involvement with an unfathomable pattern of universal justice, which requires their dissolution as part of its mysterious cycle. The form of the Idylls, within which this tragic vision is con- tained, is, as Buckley notes, "essentially a new one which is neither to be measured nor understood by the standards of the epic" (p. 173), nor, we may add, by those of conventional dramatic forms. It should be understood, rather, in terms of the ritual myth underlying all Greek tragedy, which Gilbert Murray describes in this manner: At the great spring Dromenon the tribe and the growing earth were renovated together: the earth arises afresh from her dead seeds, the tribe from its dead ances- tors; and the whole process, charged as it is with the emotion of pressing human desires, projects its anthropomorphic God or daemon. A vegetation-spirit we call him, very inadequately; he is a divine Kouros, a Year-Daemon, a spirit that in the first stage is living, then dies with each year, then thirdly rises again from the dead, raising the whole dead world with him- the Greeks called him in this phase "the Third One", or the "Saviour". The renovation ceremonies were accompanied by a casting off of the old year, the old garments, and everything that is polluted by the infection of death. And not only of death; but clearly, I think, in spite of the protests of some Hellenists, of guilt or sin also. For the life of the Year-Daemon, as it seems to be reflected in Tragedy, is generally a story of Pride and Punishment. Each Year arrives, waxes great, commits the sin of Hubris, and then is slain. The death is deserved; but the slaying is a sin; hence comes the next Year as Avenger, or as the Wronged-One re-risen. "All things pay retribution for their injustice one to another according to the ordinance of time."8 We sense, by that racial experience which produces the archetypes of belief, that the Idylls is an enactment of this ritual, that Arthur is the Year-Daemon raising up the world in gentle and gracious spring, becoming great in summer, and, bearing the burden of sin and pride, heavy with pollutions, falling toward death and replacement, perform- ing endlessly the cycle of the dying God. Indeed, Tennyson's figures, in Hazlitt's words, "act and suffer as if they were always in the 8 Five Stages of Greek Religion (London, 1925), pp. 48-49.</page><page sequence="3">Henry Kozicki 17 presence of a higher power, or as if human life itself were a religious ceremony, performed in honor of the Gods and of the State."9 Even the word "idyll" suggests a pastoral orientation and the structure of the work mimes the twelve months of the year, a conception carefully woven into the whole fabric, which contains, as it were, the four acts of a play. Arthur comes from the sea in mystery as kairos, the "fullness of time" in the divine pattern, and establishes his strange power in a final great battle, with "lightnings and great thunders over him" (CA, 107 ).10 The winter world stirs with springtime: Arthur weds Guinevere to bring "power on this dead world to make it live" (CA, 93), marrying "in stainless white, / The fair beginners of a nobler time. . . .The sacred altar blossom'd white with May, / The sun of May descended on their King" (CA, 455-461). In Camelot his war- riors are knighted "as one who wakes / Half -blinded at the coming of a light" (CA, 264-265); they sense the wonder of purity and purpose in "working out his will, / To cleanse the world" (GL, 24-25). They feel woven into a pattern of justice as they "clear'd the dark places and let in the law" (GE, 942), so "all men's hearts became / Clean for a season" (HG, 90-91). The harmony is sug- gested by the images of "loving, utter faithfulness in love" (GL, 543) and of music: the knight "felt his being move / In music with his Order and the King" (BB, 207-208); Camelot itself was built "To music, therefore never built at all, / And therefore built for ever" (GL, 273-274). But the city is a mystery, strange and uncertain, "Saving the King; tho' some there be that hold / The King a shadow, and the city real" (GL, 261-262): the old Seer says, "I have seen the good ship sail / Keel upward, and mast downward, in the heavens, / And solid turrets topsy-turvy in air; / And here is truth" (GL, 249-252). The cyclic nature of the tragedy is in Arthur's words that "The old order changeth, yielding place to new" (CA,508). The kingdom becomes peaceful and prosperous, yet strange stories trouble the air and the pattern begins to shift and evolve: "a rumor rose about the Queen, / Touching her guilty love for Lancelot" 9 "Schlegel on the Drama," The Collected Works of William Uazliit, ed.

The organic relationship between Fortune and men is suggested by Enid's song: "Turn, Fortune, turn thy wheel, and lower the proud; / Turn thy wild wheel thro' sunshine, storm, and cloud; / Thy wheel and thee we neither love nor hate" (MG, 347-349). With repeated references to "the blameless King" (GE, 931, 969), Tennyson does not develop Arthur as an agent causally related to a decaying society, yet Arthur must bear the sins and pollutions of it. Gilbert Murray explains the nature of the Greek tragic hero: Put briefly, it seems that historically the tragic hero is derived both from the Life Spirit- caU him Dionysus or what you will- who comes to save the community with the fruits of the New Year, and from the polluted Old Year, the Pharmakos or Scapegoat, who is cast out to die or wander in the wilderness, bearing with him the sins of the community. Every Year-Spirit is first new and then old, first pure and then polluted; and both phases tend to be combined in the tragic hero. Oedipus is the saviour of Thebes, the being whose advent delivered Thebes from death; Oedipus is also the abomination, the polluter of Thebes .... The conflict between two rights or two commands of conscience, which is said by Hegel to be the essence of tragedy, is already present in the tragic hero himself. ] ] In the late summer of the Arthurian world, heavy with premonition, Vivien is the catalyst that hastens the inevitable alteration; she sings of cyclic growth and decay, "The new leaf ever pushes off the old" (BB, 436), and of animal lusts, "That old true filth, and bottom of the well, / Where Truth is hidden" (MV, 47-48), promising that "This fire of heaven, / This old sun-worship, boy, will rise again, / And beat the Cross to earth" (BB, 450-452). But she, too, is only a necessary part of the pattern, recognized as such: "as Arthur in the highest / Leaven'd the world, so Vivien in the lowest, / Arriving at a time of golden rest, / And sowing one ill hint from ear to ear . . . Leaven'd his hall. They heard and let her be" (MV, 138-144). In the dying summer, the mass exaltation of the Holy Grail seizes the Knighthood and nine-tenths of them are cut down in the hopeless quest for that vision of departed purity and innocence, and Arthur accepts the necessity of the madness in the imagery of divine music: "every fiery prophet in old times, / And all the sacred madness of the bard, / When God made music thro' them, could but speak / His music by the framework and the chord; / And as ye saw it ye have spoken truth" (HG, 872-876). It is very late: Pelleas maddens and would return to the "great and sane and simple race of brutes" (PE, 471), for justice demands the destruction of a decay- ing and polluted world: "O towers so strong, / Huge, solid, would that even while I gaze / The crack of earthquake shivering to your 11 The Classical Tradition in Poetry (Cambridge, Mass., 1927), pp. 64-65.</page><page sequence="5">Henry Kozicki 19 base / Split you, and hell burst up your harlot roofs / Bellowing" (PE, 454-458). Riding wildly to "blaze the crime of Lancelot and the Queen" (PE, 558), he is thrown but spared by Lancelot, who accepts the pattern of which they all form interwoven parts: "Rise, weakling; I am Lancelot; say thy say" (PE, 570). At the Court, all "foresaw the dolorous day to be ... 'The time is hard at hand'" (PE, 593-597). A strange unreality descends upon Camelot; the mocked "Tourna- ment of the Dead Innocence" begins in "autumn thunder" (LT, 153), presided over by Lancelot "Sighing weariedly, as one / Who sits and gazes on a faded fire" (LT, 156-157), and ends in thick rain and prophecy: "under her black brows a swarthy one / Laugh'd shrilly, crying: 'Praise the patient saints, / Our one white day of Innocence hath past, / Tho' somewhat draggled at the skirt. So be it. / The snowdrop only, flowering thro' the year, / Would make the world as blank as winter-tide'" (LT, 216-221). The Fool Dagonet, "High over all the yellowing autumn-tide / Danced like a wither'd leaf before the hall" (LT, 241-242) and tells Tristram that he has broken the music; Tristram sings, "The woods are hush'd, their music is no more; / The leaf is dead, the yearning past away" (LT, 276-277). Arthur overthrows the drunken Red Knight into the marsh but his knights "trampled out his face from being known, / And sank his head in mire, and slimed themselves" (LT, 469-470), and Arthur returns to Camelot "All in a death-dumb autumn-dripping gloom" (LT,750). The wheel has turned full, from winter to winter: "The white mist, like a face-cloth to the face, / Clung to the dead earth" ( G, 7-8 ) . While about her "the spirits of the waste and weald / Moan" (G, 128-129), Guinevere hides in a nunnery and listens to the little novice sing, "No light! so late! and dark and chill the night!" (G, 172) and chatter of the Arthur whose "grave should be a mystery / From all men, like his birth" (G, 295-296). Arthur confronts Guinevere with her organic role in the transmutation of their world: "The children born of thee are sword and fire, / Red ruin, and the break- ing up of laws" (G, 422-423), but "all is past, the sin is sinn'd" (G, 540), and he accepts the mysterious pattern: "if ancient prophecies / Have err'd not, that I march to meet my doom" (G, 446-447), in fatalism, like Achilles. The last weird battle in the west is fought and only Arthur and Bedivere are left alive. Asking, "Hearest thou this great voice that shakes the world, / And wastes the narrow realm whereon we move" (PA, 139-140), the king, in "the long glories of the winter moon" (PA, 360), is placed with magic rites on the dusky barge.</page><page sequence="6">20 Victorian Poetry Bedivere bemoans the unfathomable passing of a world "And slowly answer'd Arthur from the barge: / 'The old order changeth, yielding place to new, / And God fulfils himself in many ways, / Lest one good custom should corrupt the world' " (PA, 407-410). The enigmatic cycle of birth, fullness, and decay is complete and proper, sin has been expiated, the corruption purged in blood, the world made clean once more. Bedivere watches the barge disappearing and "The stillness of the dead world's winter dawn / Amazed him, and he groan'd, 'The King is gone'" (PA, 442-443), but, if the old king is slain in the ancient vegetation rites, the young Zeus will rise with the spring, as the last line of the work suggests: "And the new sun rose bringing the new year." Within this ancient tragic form, then, Tennyson's figures are enclosed in mythic time, bound in mystery to questions of being and involvement, evil and justice, the meaning of human history. In the ritual cycle, the splendid rise to greatness and ruinous fall of a world is a poignant drama arousing the most profound of tragic emotions, because of the vision of an unfathomable pattern of justice, in all the waste and loss. Through this tragic vision, what philosophy of history does Tennyson have? In a brief discussion of Reinhold Niebuhr's views of Spengler and Toynbee, Buckley suggests that Tennyson is closest to Toynbee in believing "that civilizations are free to make mistakes" (p. 281, n. 4). Unqualified, this might be mistaken for the idea that society has the same freedom of choice an individual might, to correct tragic flaws of "sins of sensuality, and the sins of pride";12 indeed, it is tempting to equate these with the many references in the Idylls to pride and to the return to nature's state, to "reel back into the beast" (LT, 125). Tennyson's view of history, however, might be more closely linked to the Christian view propounded by Reinhold Niebuhr, with its strange paradox of "tragic destiny in history"13 coupled with freedom of choice: if civilizations die in the end, they also live. "Their life is a testimony of the creativity of history, even as their death is a proof of the sin in history" (Niebuhr, II, 305). Such a view of human affairs is evident in the Idylls, in the pattern of inevitable justice within the unknowable mystery.
