<plain_text><page sequence="1">Faith and Fragmentation: Christianity for a New Age. By J. Philip Wogaman. Fortress Press, 1985. 196 pages. $10.95. J. Philip Wogaman, professor of Christian Social Ethics at Wesley Theolog- ical Seminary, has undertaken in Faith and Fragmentation a book, addressed to a general audience, which seeks to provide foundations for Christian ethics. Wogaman attempts to answer the question "whether Christian faith makes sense in light of the sweeping changes of our age" (ix), and does so primarily by demanding "whether it brings all aspects of life into focus" (ix). Throughout the book, Wogaman uses an image taken from Ruth Bene- dict's Patterns of Culture to portray his concern for the fragmentation of con- temporary Chistian faith. It is a cup referred to by an Indian chief, who believes that God has given to every people a different clay cup, but laments that: "Our cup has broken now. It has passed away" (3). In Faith and Frag-</page><page sequence="2">Book Notices 417 mentation, Wogaman wonders if the Christian cup-i.e., the "organizing reli- gious perspective on the basis of which human experience is interpreted and evaluated" (3)-is now broken, "fatally disintegrated" (3). Wogaman's conclusion is that "Christian faith does exactly what a 'cup' is supposed to do. It contains the ongoing stream of our experience" (173). In support of that conclusion, he first lists the weaknesses of current Christian belief, next identifies the serious challenges posed to it by contemporary expe- rience, and finally, shows how he thinks Christianity can nonetheless provide a meaningful interpretive framework in this era. In chapter two, Wogaman explains some of the "wreckage" (12) of faith which prevents true faith and provides limited meaning. Among these are: religious nostalgia; religious feeling; liturgical formalism; institutional activism; fundamentalism; religious nationalism; religious rationalism; and social activ- ism. Wogaman understands that some persons may find these shards better than no cup at all, but worries that fragments may obscure the brokenness of our true condition. His fear is that "almost every aspect of the contemporary religious scene can be held as a fragment of faith, expressing, ironically, a denial of the wholeness of faith" (27). In chapter three, Wogaman concludes that religious language can be meaningful, even if we do not possess the "whole truth" (33). Wogaman employs A. J. Ayer's distinction between "practical verifiability" and "ver- ifiability in principle" (36) to argue that even if statements cannot be proven true or false, they can still be meaningful. We should not prescind from the quest for meaning, therefore, but should glean clues from our knowledge of reality, clues which will aid us to construct a "metaphorical approach to ulti- mate reality" (38)-a cup which provides a viable interpretation of experience. To do this, Wogaman introduces a general test for revelation-"Does revela- tion in fact bring reality into focus for us?" (44). For if revelation contradicts our experience, if we cannot live according to it, then we have fragmented faith, a broken cup. In the remaining chapters of the book, Wogaman confronts the challenges posed to Christianity by contemporary culture. These problems include: the anthropomorphic metaphor; conflicting cosmologies; Christian perspectives on the self and on society; the problem of evil; the church; and the relationship of Christianity to other religions. In each of these chapters, Wogaman demon- strates how twentieth century knowledge-scientific dismissals of obsolete cos- mologies, psychological insights into the human person and into religion; cultural relativism; and the strength of other religions-seems to undermine Christian faith. Then, chapter by chapter, Wogaman attempts to show how Christianity can still be meaningful. An example is provided by Wogaman's treatment of the problem of evil in chapter eight. The Holocaust and persistent racism are identified as serious contemporary challenges to traditional Christian resolutions of this problem. Wogaman's response to one type of evil-moral evil-is to insist on the "rela- tionship between God's love and human freedom" (129). That is, "to be capa- ble of freely pursuing good purposes, people must also be capable of freely pursuing evil ones" (129). Christianity can respond to this problem in a mean-</page><page sequence="3">418 Journal of the American Academy of Religion ingful way, therefore, because "trusting love," "to trust the goodness of the power beyond ourselves" is the "enduring antidote for evil," "the only escape from the morass of anxious motivation" (132). Chapter eight illustrates both the strengths and the weaknesses of the book. Wogaman is at his best in identifying and acknowledging the sources of brokenness in contemporary Christian faith. Yet his response to these "frag- ments" is frequently disappointing. That is, Wogaman seems to move rather quickly to affirming or asserting the relevance and appropriateness of the Christian interpretation of reality; but his arguments in support of Christianity are not sufficiently detailed, and therefore not always persuasive. Such detail might provide even stronger evidence for an acceptance of the possibilities of Christian faith in an age of fragmentation. Leslie Griffin University of Notre Dame</page></plain_text>
