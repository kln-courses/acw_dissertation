A symposium held at the Jewish Museum of New York in December 1982, coordi- nated by Leonard Gorelick and Elizabeth Williams-Forte, has been published as a book with a preface and an introduction. In the preface, Williams-Forte endorses the new Syro-Palestinian archaeology "with its methods, theoretical concerns and goals as distinct from those of Bib- lical archaeologists." Gorelick's introduc- tion gives an overview of the symbolic use of seals in the texts of the Old and New Testaments. There are thirty refer- ences to seals and sealings in each. Gore- lick separates these into metaphoric and functional categories. The latter category is subdivided into bureaucratic use, which entails designation and delegation of authority as well as protection of gov- ernment property, and nonbureaucratic or personal use, such as votive offerings, amulets, and ornaments. Whereas two- thirds of the Old Testament references are to functional seals, only one-third of the New Testament references to seals belongs to this class. The explanation for this difference stems from the need in Old Testament times for "control and trappings of nationhood," a need less critical in New Testament times. Another interesting observation is that fifty per- Biblical Archaeologist, December 1987 253</page><page sequence="2">cent of the Old Testament references are nonbureaucratic, whereas in the New Testament all references are nonbureau- cratic; the personal seal was of no signi- ficance to the poor and powerless early Christians. In his provocative article, "'As the Seal upon thine Arm': Glyptic Metaphors in the Biblical World," William Hallo discusses several biblical passages refer- ring to seals and examines them in the light of literary and lexical evidence from Mesopotamia. According to Hallo, there is a term for seals in Sumerian that belongs to the "substrate vocabulary of the early Chalcolithic Age." In Hebrew, however, the two terms, hotam and tabacat, are of Egyptian origin. From the seal's basic use as a legal means of mark- ing ownership, it also became a symbolic representation of the individual. This would explain the enigmatic reference to Judah's "leaving his seal as part of him- self" in the story of Tamar and Judah in the book of Genesis. The seal, or hotam, was actually a cylinder seal and the cord, or petil, was the necklace to which the seal was attached; the staff, or mateh, was the pin that attached the seal to the necklace. As Hallo states, this clearly shows that the cylinder seal was part of the imagery of the biblical author. Considered precious items, seals were donated to gods as votives and were placed on the cult statues of the deity. Hallo suggests that the rings mentioned in Exodus 35:22 that were brought to the Tabernacle as offerings were actually sig- net rings. The seals were symbols of a personal relationship and were consid- ered special gifts between man and god or from the king to his officers, like the signet ring conferred to Joseph by Pha- raoh. This finds expression in the books of Jeremiah, Haggai, and the Song of Songs in phrases like "make you a signet." The reference in these texts is to the stamp seal set in a ring. The "seal upon thine arm" refers to the earlier form of stamp seal suspended from the wrist. The cylinder seal is known from archae- ological evidence to have been suspended from a pin that fastened the robe; later it was attached to a necklace. In "The Snake and the Tree in the Iconography and Texts of Syria During the Bronze Age," Williams-Forte makes an attempt to identify scenes represent- ing the Weather God fighting his snake adversary, depicted on Middle Bronze Age seals from North Syria and Anatolia, with texts from Late Bronze Age Ugarit. This approach is based on Thorkild Jacobsen's idea of the anthropomorphic deity fighting his early nonanthropo- morphic form that developed into his adversary. The snake in these seals rep- resents the conquered enemy of the Weather God. Williams-Forte's identifi- cation of the Weather God scenes with later texts is a most tempting idea. It would be easier for the reader, however, if the iconographic study were separated from the interpretative/textual analysis. Her identification of the tree branch as the special weapon of this god on seals from the twentieth century B.C.E. on- wards in Anatolia and later in Syria and her identification of the snake in scenes hitherto unrecognized as such are inter- esting. Although most of the Weather God's attributes are present in the Middle Bronze IIA seals, the four stages of his battle with the serpent are only represented in seals from the Middle Bronze IIB. This cycle is rarely represented in Late Bronze Age seals, the period of the Ugaritic texts. Williams-Forte does not accept the identification of the snake with Yam or one of his companions, since the snake is not necessarily a sea monster. She puts forward the uncon- vincing identification with Bacal's (= the Weather God) second enemy, Mot, who represents death and sterility. Williams-Forte believes that "the con- nection between the storm god, tree and serpent in the early pictorial, and pos- sibly textual traditions of the 'Lands of the Bible' may provide the link, previous- ly missing, between these figures that will allow further inquiry into the pre- cise significance of the evil snake's ap- pearance in the tree in the garden." Ruth Hestrin offers a summary of the Hebrew seals of officials, with and without titles, from the eighth through sixth centuries B.C.E. The titled officials are Royal Steward, Scribe, Son of the King, Servant, Governor of the City, and Chief of the Corv~e. On the "private" seals of office-holders, the names are inscribed without their titles. Important information about this category of seals is derived from the famous ostraca and seals from Arad and Lachish. Although the late eighth century date for the lamelekh seals was established by the recent excavations of Lachish, as well as their connection with the "private" seals impressed on the same jar, the purpose and place of production of these sealings still remain obscure. Frank Moore Cross discusses the various aspects of the beautiful "Miq- neyaw, Servant of Yahweh" seal, whose alleged origin is the vicinity of Jerusalem. Inscribed on both sides, this seal finds parallels in other Hebrew seals of the eighth century, particularly its first half. On the strength of the comparative material, Cross also confirms the eighth- century date of the much debated seals of 'Elyaqim ndcar Yawkin found in Tell Beit Mirsim, Ramat Rahel, and Lachish. A review of the instances in which the title cebed Yahweh or "Servant DN" (deity name) appear in West Semitic sources shows that it is frequently used by priestly officials rather than by kings. The name Miqneyaw is mentioned once in the Old Testament as the name of a famous musician. This elegant seal, according to Cross, may have been that of a high cultic functionary, perhaps a chief musician in the temple. Hence, the plural term cabde Yahweh of Psalms 135:1 possibly designates a temple choir. The final article in this book is by A. John Gwinnett and Gorelick, who present some results of their studies of the manufacture of the seals, in particular those pertaining to the use of a drill. The illuminating and at times pro- vocative articles in this volume make us wish that lectures from symposia of this nature were more often made available.
