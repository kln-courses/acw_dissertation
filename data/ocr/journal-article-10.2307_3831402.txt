<plain_text><page sequence="1">SANDRA KUMAMOTO STANLEY CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY, NORTHRIDGE THE LINK BETWEEN WILLIAMS AND ZUKOFSKY* In 1928, William Carlos Williams wrote Louis Zukofsky a letter, indieating that he recognized a significant historical link between the young poet and himself: I was happy to find a link between myself and another wave of it. Sometimes one thinks the thing has died down. I believe that somehow you have benefited from my work . . . that the thing moves by a direct relationship between men from generation to generation.1 Zukofsky and Williams had an ongoing friendship from 1928 until Williams' death in 1963. Zukofsky regarded Williams as one of the most important American writers of his generation, while Williams regarded Zukofsky as an uncompromising and original poet. And although Williams felt that Zukofsky's poetry could be unrelenting (and uncompromising) at the expense of the reader's understanding?he also felt the intelligent stab of Zukofsky's poems and compared some of them to the avant-garde paintings at the 1913 Armory show: "I begin to see the world being recreated again as it has not been since 1913."2 Moreover, when Zukofsky published Anew in 1946, Williams wrote to Zukofsky "that the whole I wish gratefully to acknowledge the permissions received both from Paul Zukofsky (to quote from the Zukofsky material) and from New Directions (to quote from the William Carlos Williams material) used in this article. 1 Letter of Easter 1928 from William Carlos Williams to Louis Zukofsky, in the Zukofsky Collection at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center of the University of Texas at Austin. Hereafter cited as HRC. 2 Letter of 2 February 1931 from William Carlos Williams to Louis Zukofsky, HRC. In a letter of 29 April 1931 Williams, on the one hand, warns Zukofsky that his poems' themes are so difficult that he doesn't "allow the reader to get started." One the other hand, Williams, in a letter of 15 October 1930, congratulates Zukofsky for his refusal to compromise: "Certainly you have not compromised, it is precisely because you have not that it succeeds."

STANLEY complex of the work and thought initiate a completely new era in the making of poems. The writers will catch on, shall we say? in 1976 (the new American Revolution)."3 Both Zukofsky and Williams regarded their relationship with the eyes of literary historians, imbuing their personal friendship with historical significance?as though they were "contemporary particulars"4 placed within the framework of a modern literary history. And, indeed, they were right, for their relationship represents an important segue between the Modernist revolution of the word and the post-Modernist fracturing of the word?both of which involve fundamental attitudes about the medium of language and the mediating subject. In 1928, Pound had acted as a matchmaker to their friendship, urging Williams to contact the young poet. Their meeting proved fruitful, and the relationship between the two poets gave birth to a variety of projects: Zukofsky wrote several articles on Williams, edited, and even published a series of Williams' poems; Williams, for his part, advised and encouraged the young poet and wrote several pieces about Zukofsky's poetry. Despite the fact that Williams was twenty years older than Zukofsky, Williams rarely behaved as the elder teacher; in fact, if anyone, it was Zukofsky who assumed the didactic role. In the early 1930s, their friendship suffered a brief rift, apparently because Williams felt that Zukofsky, as Pound once did, "represented certain critical restraints that acted as a check"5 upon the elder poet. Explaining the temporary breach in their friendship, Williams would later write: I think that in our friendship there's much more to come and I for one am in a better position to appreciate it today than I was yesterday. We were too damned close together for a while. That's no good. The most anyone can do is to be a kind of mirror for the other. And the mirror had better be a clear one, not a tinted one, just clear.6 It is important to stress that Zukofsky effected a reciprocal influence on Williams. For while Zukofsky's relationship with Williams demonstrates both Zukofsky's appropriation of and growth out of the central tenets of Modernism, Williams' relationship with Zukofsky gives us insight into Williams' later poetry in which he was clearly influenced by the theoretician Zukofsky. Both men recognized that, as Williams stated, they shared "a common ground which is our common inheritance of poetry": "it 3 Letter of 21 June 1946 from Williams to Zukofsky, HRC.

How does the poet reconcile the poetics of experience and the materials of history? Their joint endeavors, however, would lead them to different solutions. Moreover, although Williams insisted that each should be a clear mirror for the other, the two men actually would see each other's work refracted through their own understanding of poetry. Williams, of course, represents the "first wave" of modern American poets. Rejecting a Romantic and Symbolist sensibility, Williams bequeaths to his fellow poets a naked world, stripped of "the beautiful illusion,"9 a world in which the self co-exists with numinous objects. In Spring and All, Williams articulates his desire to raise the individual "to some approximate co-extension with the universe;"10 "to refine, to clarify, to intensify that eternal moment in which we alone live;"11 to "escape from crude symbolism, the annihilation of strained associations, complicated ritualistic forms designed to separate work from v reality.'"12 To achieve such a desired end, Williams created seemingly simple poems such as the famed "Red Wheelbarrow," and, in doing so, inaugurated what some would call a poetics of reality, what others would call a poetics of experience, and what still others would call a poetics of presence.13 As J. Hillis Miller has pointed out, such poems are a manifestation of Williams' concepts?his rejection of symbolism, his primordial union of subject and object, his wish to purify and renew the language, his particular treatment of time and space to create an object, the poem, which dances with a life of its own.14 In such poems as the "Red 7 Letter of 26 January 1947 from Williams to Zukofsky, HRC. 8 William Carlos Williams, Paterson (New Directions, 1963), p. 6.

STANLEY Wheelbarrow" or "Young Sycamore," the first lines urge the reader to participate in the immediacy of the poem; the respective lines "so much depends" and "I must tell you"15 demand that the reader confront the text. The objects? whether a red wheelbarrow and chickens or a tree and pavement?exist side by side, each pointing to no greater meaning than itself. But these objects, by the invitation of the first line, call for a participation of the reader, a union of object and subject, and so much depends on that function of the poem?for the imagination to engulf and be engulfed by a purified and renewed language. When Williams read Zukofsky's earlier poetry, he saw his own image reflected in the text, that link between one generation and another. But we may question what, exactly, Williams saw. Certainly Zukofsky owed much to the revolutionary Spring and All, in which Williams not only challenged the precepts of Symbolism and traditional metric verse but also found a language and rhythm to replace the traditional poetics he challenged. But, as we can see in his early poem "Poem 2," Zukofsky was already creating a poetics distinct from that of Williams: Not much more than being, Thoughts of isolate, beautiful Being at evening, to expect at a riverfront:: A shaft dims With a turning wheel; Men work on a jetty By a broken wagon; Leopard, glowing-spotted, The summer river? Under: The Dragon:16 "Poem 2" is precisely the type of poem which many critics regard as one influenced by Williams' poetics of presence. In a 1968 interview, L.S. Dembo asks Zukofsky if "Poem 2" demonstrated the poet's ability to see "as an objectivist, in terms of particularities rather than wholes," in terms of objects rather than abstractions.17 Obviously, Dembo is attempting to 15 The Collected Earlier Poems of William Carlos Williams (New Directions, 1951), pp. 277, 332.

Eliot and Ezra Pound.</page><page sequence="5">WILLIAMS AND ZUKOFSKY 57 align Zukofsky's poem with Williams' poems of numinous things, which in obedience to Pound's dictum, go "in fear of abstractions."18 Sidestepping Dembo's assertions, Zukofsky replies, "But the abstract idea is particular, too. . . . this poem is an example of what happens if you deal mostly with sight and a bit of intellect."19 Zukofsky is emphasizing that he has not sacrificed the abstract thought upon the altar of the literal object. Zukofsky then explains his reading of "Poem 2": But it all mounts up. I suppose there's a general statement: "Not much more than being," whatever that is. The opposite would be non-being. And then I go ahead and say a little more about it; that being becomes isolate being, a beautiful being. These are all assertions. Where is this? That's the first tangible thing, a river-front; the one I saw was probably the Hudson or the East River. But the point is that the river-front becomes more solid as against the general flow of the intellect .... The first part is intellective, "gaseous"; the second part would resemble the "solid" state. Now what kind of being? There is a shaft with a turning wheel; there are men on a jetty, and a broken wagon. It could have been a good wagon, but I wanted it to be broken. And above this, the sky. So actually I suppose the guy who was doing this was trying to get the whole picture, instead of saying as a "romantic" poet, "Now I'm seeing, now I'm being; I see the jetty; this wagon was once pretty."20 Zukofsky is interested in subverting the romantic and symbolist sensibility by reversing what he perceives to be the "romantic process." As Zukofsky states, the "romantic" poet would view the scene on the river-front and say, "Now I'm seeing, now I'm being; I see the jetty; this wagon was once pretty." Of course, Zukofsky is parodying the process (perhaps an abbreviated version of the Romantic crisis ode) in which the imagination seizes hold of the object?in this case the scene?and transforms it into an often emotive, and at times even elegiac, expression of itself. In Zukofsky's poem, the thought coexists with the scene, or, to use his words, now I'm being, now I'm seeing. But unlike Williams, Zukofsky is not circumventing abstract thought by seeking a radical union between the self and object: in the second line of "Poem 2" Zukofsky takes "Thoughts of isolate, beautiful / Being" and sets these abstract thoughts next to a tangible being?a river-front. 18 Ezra Pound, "A Retrospect," in The Literary Essays of Ezra Pound, ed.

STANLEY When Williams first read Zukofsky's poetry, he felt a kinship with the younger poet, but he also realized that Zukofsky was doing something different. Zukofsky has stated, "What really concerned me in these early poems was trying to get away from . . . sounding like everybody else."21 Apparently, Williams thought Zukofsky had succeeded. In an April 1928 letter, Williams writes, "It is a thoughtful poetry, but actual word stuff, not thoughts for thoughts. It escapes me in its analysis (thank God) and strikes me [a]s a thing (thank God). There are not so many things in the world as we commonly imagine. Plenty of debris, plenty of smudges."22 Williams realized that Zukofsky did not "go in fear of abstractions,"23 but, as Zukofsky would tell Dembo many years later, had made the abstract idea a particular, the thought a thing. The issue of "thingness" or ding an sich is crucial for Williams; for him, what could best convey the nature of the "thing" was the hard-edged image, a fundamental part of Williams' poetics. In fact, Williams perceived himself as the poet of the "eye," the artist who conveyed the "given-ness" of his world. Zukofsky, too, wants to locate his poems in this world, and both Williams and Zukofsky create poems which occupy a shallow space?pointing neither outward to a symbolic other, nor inward to a searching examination of the self. Yet the two men create two different open fields in which to map out their poetics. Williams' main concern, as he articulates it in Spring and All, is to undercut the tradition of abstract and "beautiful illusions,"24 the transcendental impetus. Thus, Williams firmly plants the self, things, and the poem as object in this world. Zukofsky's main concern in his early poems, as he discusses them with Dembo, is a desire to subvert the "romantic" poet's desire to privilege the seeing self over the seen world. In an excellent essay on Zukofsky, Burton Hatlen points out that Zukofsky recognizes an implicit problem in "poems of the eye," for behind the "perceiving eye" is the "philosophical I."25 Hatlen quotes from Zukofsky's Bottom on Shakespeare: Looking has its own logic, but (it may be inferred from Wittgenstein's looking logic) he who looks is still the philosophical /, the metaphysical subject, the limit?not a part of the world. To say the eye sees the whole or wholeness of what it sees means only that the philosophical / has reached 21 Dembo, 273. 22 Letter of 2 April 1928 from Williams to Zukofsky, HRC. 23 "A Retrospect," p. 5.

As for true conceptions they are, as Spinoza said, "of thought" until words disguise and imperil or feign them. Their wholeness also is inexpressible; it exists. But language too, like the feigning of the imagination has its own wholeness.26 The "philosophical I" sitting behind the imagistic poem is just one step away from the "privileged I." And, for Zukofsky, the answer would lie not in the "feigning imagination" of the seeing I/eye, but in the feigned wholeness of language. Early in his career, Zukofsky would need to work out of the vocabulary of his predecessors, and the most fundamental component of that poetics was the image. But when Zukofsky depicts an image or paints a scene?a scene which Williams could create with vitality and precision?it is quickly apparent that Zukofsky is using paints from a different palette. Of course, Williams' poetics is not limited to what Roy Harvey Pearce terms "his poems of seeing,"27 poems in which the perceiving subject would make immediate and tactile contact with the perceived object. But for Williams the mere image represents the fundamental component of his poetics; it is his most vital "figure of contact."28 Williams considers sight to be his greatest asset, and with an artist's intensity, he portrays scenes through his medium of language. Even in a poem such as "Classic Scene," in which Williams never mentions an "I," the poet unifies the perceiving subject and perceived object: A power-house in the shape of a red brick chair 90 feet high on the seat of which sit the figures of two metal stacks?aluminum? commanding an area of squalid shacks side by side? from one of which Louis Zukofsky, Bottom on Shakespeare (Ark Press, 1963; rpt.

STANLEY buff smoke streams while under a grey sky the other remains passive today29 Here, in this industrial landscape, Williams brings into being Henry Adams's dynamo, a phallic power and silent force. As "commanding" suggests, the power-house dominates the landscape. Although the poem seems to consist of an object, not a subject in this case, the object is the subject. The poet's sensual energy seizes the dynamo?extending ninety feet high?and transforms the object into an anthropomorphic image. As Dickran Tashjian suggests, "Williams uses words that can be taken to describe the power-house literally but that also extend a submerged conceit likening the smokestacks to monolithic figures, ancient sculptures of the gods on their thrones perhaps."30 Williams' simple image?infused with sexual and religious power?suggests both the phallocentric and theocentric. Although "Classic Scene," like a number of Williams' "descriptive phrase" poems, consists of an incomplete sentence (in this case, an absolute construction with a nonfinite verb), the poet's eye?in an act of penetration?presents a coherent and complete sense of the object before us; we follow the power-house as it stretches to its commanding ninety feet, and we then focus upon the balanced image of the metal stacks sitting "side by side"?one industriously smoking, the other stack not in use. Both the anthropomorphic images and the sibilant sounds find a resting place in the last line: "passive today." When he depicts his own imagistic poem, Zukofsky brings to the word the attention which Williams provides for the object. When Zukofsky constructs an American urban scene, in "Poem 3" of 29 Poems, he does not pick up the image of Adams' dynamo or the image of figure 5, but he focuses upon the word, "cocktails": Cocktails and signs of "ads" flashing, light's waterfalls, Bacchae among electric lights "The Classic Scene," Earlier Poems, p. 407.

Hereafter cited as Tashjian.</page><page sequence="9">WILLIAMS AND ZUKOFSKY 61 will swarm the crowds streamers of the lighted skyscrapers nor tripping over underbrush but upon pavement (Spring, 25). Zukofsky's poem provides its reader neither with unity nor with harmony of perception. Williams' poems "The Great Figure" and "Classic Scene" inevitably propel the reader forward from one isolate word to the next; both poems promise the reader a continuity of vision. But from the first word of "Poem 3," the reader looks for familiar "signs" and "signals" which mark his stable entry into the poem. Is the reader viewing a cocktail ad on a billboard? Or are the crowds?the Bacchanals?drinking cocktails? Or does cocktail suggest a cock's tail? Or do the flashing lights look like the multicolor peacock's tail? Perspective continually shifts and dissolves throughout the poem. Inasmuch as Tashjian suggests that Sheeler's Classic Landscape is the inspiration for the classic lines of Williams' poem,31 we could just as well suggest that Zukofsky looks to the word, not the image, for his source. In fact, in his 1923 edition of The American Language, H.L. Mencken cites the word "cocktail" as an example of American ingenuity: "In the department of conviviality the imaginativeness of Americans was shown both in the invention and in the naming of new and often highly complex beverages" in contrast to the "far more limited imagination" of the English.32 We might say that in his poem, Williams realizes precisionist clarity; and, in his poem, Zukofsky realizes American ingenuity. For "Poem 3" is an ingenious play with sound and meaning. Or it might be more accurate to say that Zukofsky is presenting "the image"?what he has called the basic form of the poem?but that his formalist means of rendering that image are radically different from Williams' means of conveying the numinous object. For Zukofsky realizes that any image in a poem is first a physical word, not a numinous object. Thus, we may surmise that Zukofsky is "getting at" the image in a way distinct from Williams' nominalistic method. Williams seeks an elemental contact with the object before him, an interpenetration of the subject and object. Yet Williams' interpenetration is a poetic act akin to both religious incarnation and sexual intercourse. In either case, the "I" behind the "perceiving eye" seizes upon the object?in an act suggestive of both worship and rape. In such a way, Williams' poem is reminiscent of other literary traditions, elements which are antithetical to his poetics. We can 31 Tashjian, pp. 84-86. The American Language (Alfred A. Knopf, 1926), p. 102.</page><page sequence="10">62 SANDRA K. STANLEY remember Donne's cry to "batter my heart, three-personed God .... for I, / Except You enthrall me, never shall be free, / Nor ever chaste, except You ravish me";33 and there is the example of Yeats's "Leda and the Swan," in which both Leda and the poet are seized and overwhelmed by the power of the transcendent.34 In Williams' case, it is the conveyor of the experience, the seeing "I," who holds power as poet/creator and see- er/seer. As he writes in his autobiography, "I am extremely sexual in my desires: I carry them everywhere and at all times. I think that from that arises the drive which empowers us all."35 Williams encounters the objects of the world with a Whitmanesque embrace, a desire for the primordial union which Whitman articulates in "Crossing Brooklyn Ferry": "What is more subtle than this which ties me to the woman or man that looks in my face / Which fuses me into you now, and pours my meaning into you?"36 But in these two poems, of course, Williams is not the "I" of "Crossing Brooklyn Ferry," for his intent is not to transform the world into an expression of himself. He bypasses that temptation by placing himself directly into that world, co-extensive with the universe. He also acknowledges that the poem is not a privileged object in that world: the power-house is an object, and the poem about the power-house is an object; one does not take precedence over the other.37 Still, within the boundaries of his text, Williams remains the "empowered" mediating subject who determines what is perceived and what is spoken in the poem; it is the poet who calls the image into existence. Also, his text, although not symbolic, is clearly referential. Williams calls into question neither the mediating object not the poem's language. Zukofsky will do both. Although Zukofsky clearly feels that he shares a common ground with Williams, in order to escape the metaphysical subject lurking behind the "perceiving I," he attempts to place the power in the medium, rather than in the mediating subject. Zukofsky desires to escape the Adamic impulse 33 John Donne, "Holy Sonnet 14" in The Norton Anthology of English Literature, Vol. 1, ed. M.H. Abrams, et. al. (W.W. Norton &amp; Co., Inc, 1962), pp. 785-786. 4 W.B. Yeats, "Leda and the Swan," in The Norton Anthology of Literature, Vol. 2, ed. M.H. Abrams, et. al., (W.W. Norton &amp; Co., Inc), p. 1359.

Richard Ellmann and Robert O'Clair (W.W.Norton &amp; Co, Inc, 1973), p. 26. Such a supposition is a little tricky, for Williams has stated, on the one hand, that he emphasizes a catholic acceptance in which the individual is raised "to some approximate co-extension with the universe," while on the other hand, he has also proclaimed the bardic role of the poet who, like Adam, creates the world through his language.</page><page sequence="11">WILLIAMS AND ZUKOFSKY 63 to invent the world by naming it. Instead, as Williams had acknowledged that he lived in a world of given objects, Zukofsky acknowledges that he lives in a world of given words?words which he discovers, rather than creates. As Zukofsky writes in "An Objective," "One is brought back to the entirety of the single word which is in itself a relation, an implied metaphor, an arrangement, a harmony or a dissonance" (Prepositions,\4). When Zukofsky uses a word such as "cocktails," he realizes that that word comes to him with many connotations, and, to a certain extent, that the word has a life of its own. No matter what the poet's "true conception" is, Zukofsky realizes that words can "disguise and imperil or feign them."38 The poet, in a special sense, is not a creator, but a craftsman. Recognizing that the word has many references, Zukofsky carves the word as a craftsman would carve a piece of wood?revealing the peculiar properties of his material. In this poem, we can see that Zukofsky is breaking away from a system in which language refers to meaning?that stable relationship between signifier and signified?and calling upon a system in which language constitutes meaning?the signifier can also signify various possible meanings. Throughout his "Poem 3," Zukofsky literally plays with "signs" and "signals," regarding signifiers as dynamic forces. Zukofsky begins his poem with "Cocktails / and signs of / vads'" (Spring, 25). By putting quotation marks around the word "ads," Zukofsky foregrounds the word, making us think about the word, insisting that we see it as an opaque, and not a transparent, signifier. Zukofsky concludes his poem with his initial play with perspective: "where on the air (elevated) / waves flash?and out? / leap / signaling?lights below" (Spring, 26). Are the "air waves" signaling to the lights below? Or are the lights below signaling to the "waves flash"? Zukofsky calls into question what we see and what we hear (air-waves are also ear-waves) by destabilizing our "signals" or language markers. Moreover, in fracturing the word and the "eye"?the image?Zukofsky also fractures the "I"?the perceiving subject. When Zukofsky destabilizes the medium, he also destabilizes the mediating subject. In breaking the surface of the poem, Zukofsky chooses not to replicate the Edenic wholeness of Williams' vision, that vision which gives us back the unbroken essence of things. In an essay on Charles Sheeler, Williams writes that for the artist. "it is in the shape of the thing that the essence lies . . . he must possess that really glandular perception of their uniqueness which realizes in them an end in itself, each piece irreplaceable by a substitute, not to be broken down to other meaning. Not to pull out, transubstantiate, boil, unglue, hammer, melt, digest, and psychoanalyze, not even to distill 38 Bottom, p. 89.</page><page sequence="12">64 SANDRA K. STANLEY but to see and keep what the understanding touches intact?as grapes are round and come in bunches."39 In the moment of his poem, Williams recovers a world and a language of visionary wholeness. Like Emerson's transparent eyeball, Williams encounters an "eternal moment," in which the imagination revitalizes an Edenic world: "to see and keep what the understanding touches intact." Zukofsky's poems, on the other hand, keep neither the world nor language intact. Zukofsky is not seeking a visionary moment of integration, in which "grapes are round and come in bunches." For Zukofsky, the world and language only feign the wholeness of the transparent eyeball; and, finally, for him, neither the eye nor language, the seen nor the said, is transparent. Of course, such a comparison between Williams' "descriptive poems" and Zukofsky's fractured "word stuff" is only a limited sampling of their poetry. But, from the outset, it was Zukofsky's fractured and abstract language which troubled Williams, who valued the "objective clarities of image."40 In a July 1928 letter to Zukofsky, Williams wrote: Sometimes though I don't like your language. It probably is me and not you who should be blamed for this. You are wrestling with the antagonist under newer rules. But I can't see "all live processes," "orbit-trembling," "our consciousness," "the sources of being"?what the hell? I'm not finding fault. I'm just trying to nail what troubles me. It may be that I am too literal in my search for objective clarities of image. It may be that you are completely right in forcing abstract conceptions into the sound pattern. I dunno. Anyhow, there you are. I will say that in this case the abstract, philosophic-jargonist language is not an obstruction. It may be that when the force of the conception is sufficiently strong it can carry this sort of thing. If the force were weaker the whole poem would fall apart. Good, perhaps. Perhaps by my picayune, imagistic mannerisms I hold together superficially what should by all means fall apart."41 Williams could not fully understand the "newer rules" which Zukofsky was formulating; indeed, Zukofsky himself had not yet come to terms with these rules. Thus, Williams' misgivings about Zukofsky's language are understandable, for, in the 1920s and 1930s, Zukofsky was constructing The Selected Essays of William Carlos Williams (New Directions, 1969), p. 233. William Carlos Williams, The Selected Letters (McDowell, Oblensky, 1957), p. 102. Hereafter cited as Selected Letters. 41 Selected Letters, pp. 102-103.</page><page sequence="13">WILLIAMS AND ZUKOFSKY 65 the "newer rules" of his poetics out of the "old rules" of his predecessors. At the same time Zukofsky would use the terms of his predecessors, he was rethinking and redefining those terms. For instance, we can see that Williams defined the "image" much more literally than did Zukofsky. Zukofsky, for his part, allowed for both Williams' nominalistic image and the idea as a particularity in his own consideration of the term. Moreover, while Zukofsky was trying to wrestle "with the antagonist under [the] newer rules" of his developing poetics, Williams, for his part, was also trying to come to terms with the implications of the poetics he had already developed. He would need to determine whether the "objective clarities of image" might suffice for his own poetic concerns, concerns that would eventually lead to his epic poem Paterson. Williams would have to find a way to reconcile the poetics of experience with history. Although Williams had told Zukofsky "not to take my theories too seriously,"42 he was disturbed by Zukofsky's use of abstract language in lieu of the concrete image. "Poems are inventions richer in thought as image," he wrote the young poet.43 But Williams would allow that Zukofsky had a "rare gift"44 for creating music in his poetry, and he concluded that Zukofsky was creating a poetics which emphasized sound over sight, music over the image. In fact, in order to try to understand Zukofsky's objectives, Williams perceived two different but complementary functions in their artistic roles: Williams was the painter- poet, and Zukofsky was the musician-poet. Still, however, he did warn Zukofsky that music could not take the place of the image, especially if that music accompanied abstract and stilted lyrics. "Yet," the elder poet conceded, "I am willing to grant?to listen."45 And, indeed, Williams was willing to listen to much more than Zukofsky's poetry. Although he had his doubts about Zukofsky's poetic language, Williams quickly recognized and respected Zukofsky's editorial and critical skills. Very soon after the beginning of their friendship, Zukofsky was editing and writing critical pieces on Williams' poetry. In fact, soon after they met, Zukofsky helped Williams edit "The Descent of Winter" for Pound's Autumn Exile. William Schott has argued that in "The Descent of Winter," Williams, "perhaps unconsciously, was seeking to bridge over the gap" between his poems and his theoretical prose. According to Schott, "he couldn't quite do it. Chasms of logic and event intervene. But the intent of the union is clearly there."46 It was during this time, which Schott, as well as others, has identified as a dark period in Williams' life, that Williams met Zukofsky. To some extent, the young 42 Selected Letters, p. 94.

STANLEY Zukofsky rekindled the elder poet's desire to continue to develop key issues of his poetics. In one of his early letters to Zukofsky, Williams writes, "You make me want to carry out deferred designs."47 As Reed Whittemore testifies in his biography of Williams, Zukofsky was to become "a significant force in WCW's career."48 In a sense, both poets?junior and senior?were in the midst of developing their poetics. Of course, by the time that Williams met Zukofsky, he had already constructed the core of his poetics of presence and had written several crucial works, including Kora in Hell and Spring and All; but Williams did not feel that his contribution to American poetry had ceased. And Zukofsky agreed. When planning his Objectivist issue of Poetry, Zukofsky wrote Pound a letter indicating that the poets of 1913 were also the poets of the 1930s: "Think 1*11 have as good a v movement' as that of the premiers imagistes?point is Wm. C. W. of today is not what he was in 1913, neither are you if you're willing to contribute?if I'm going to show what's going on today you'll have to. The older generation is not the older generation if it's alive &amp; up?Can't see why you shd. appear in the H &amp; H alive with 3 Cantos &amp; not show that you are the [younger] generation in v Poetry.' What's age got to do with verbal manifestation, what's history to do with it,?good gord lets disassociate ijees?I want to show the poetry that's being written today?whether the poets are of masturbating age or the fathers of families don't matter."49 For Zukofsky, his friends Pound and Williams were alive and well, still members of the younger generation. At the same time, however, Zukofsky regarded both men with the studious eye of an historian. Studying and recording their contributions, Zukofsky wrote such articles as "American Poetry 1920-1930." In his own way, Zukofsky expanded Modernist issues by defining and interpreting what Williams and Pound, as well as other Modernists, had already done; and in so doing, Zukofsky was helping to name the Modernist issues of the past and to develop the Modernist issues of the present. After reading Zukofsky's article "American Poetry," a then-despondent Williams wrote Zukofsky a curious letter: I am not the person you think, I have not done the work you say I have. But it is the truth that I have wanted to say, to make, to make visible. It is rather yourself who has imagined the scene and fitted our work, of a somewhat earlier Selected Letters, p. 94. 48 William Carlos Williams: Poet from Jersey (Houghton Mifflin Co., 1975), p. 240.

But you have created something which we at least cannot let disappear.50 Williams suggests that Zukofsky's own critical imagination has put together the pieces of and has justified many of his Modernist theoretical ideals. Zukofsky, like the Biblical Adam, has bestowed what Williams has called this far-off "country I have always wished to live in and shall never find"51 with a type of existence by the sheer act of naming it. In his critical writings of the late 1920s and early 1930s, Zukofsky was helping to place revolutionary Modernist theories into the public domain, extending the Modernist's patent rights to himself as well as the other poets. In his articles on Williams, Zukofsky recognizes the great contribution that the elder poet has made to American poetics, and in "American Poetry 1920-1930," Zukofsky highlights Williams as the most important American poet of the 1920s. But Zukofsky did not merely play the objective scholar, recording a slice of history, for he was also a practicing poet interested in building upon his predecessors' contributions. Zukofsky was not content merely to play Boswell to Williams' Johnson; in fact, Zukofsky's developing poetics would influence Williams' own thinking. From the outset of their friendship, Williams recognized Zukofsky's gift for bringing the poetic act into the arena of the "said." In a 1932 review of Zukofsky's "Objectivist" Anthology, "Williams admitted that the anthology was faulty, but defended Zukofsky as an innovator, as an originator of discourse. Simply put, Williams writes, "Had he not said it it would not have been said."52 But, for us, the important question is how exactly Williams did attempt to integrate Zukofsky's "said" into his poetic act. In the late 1920s, Zukofsky was constructing a poetics to meet the challenge of his epic poem M." Williams for his part had completed several of his revolutionary prose works and poems, but he had yet to start his final epic project, for he was still basically working out of the unity of what he called his "imagistic mannerisms."53 In a 1930 letter to Pound, Zukofsky distinguishes himself from Williams, contrasting his exigency to write his life-work nAn to Williams' writing of his short poems: "I mean I don't do as Bill does?notice something and write the note down and then type it off (or write it out) and?another poem! .... how I wish again and again that 50 Letter of 2 July 1930 from Williams to Zukofsky, HRC. 51 Letter of 23 February 1953 from Zukofsky to Lorine Niedecker, HRC.

STANLEY I could still be writing short poems?be excited into a song or something as brief and essential (!) i.e. I'd rather be the troubadours (or one of them) than Dante, Burns instead of your papa's Ring and the Book or Sordello, or one of Shake's songs than any long poem vbuilt on a plan.'"54 Twenty years later, Williams would construct his own epic poem, Paterson; but in those intervening years, Williams searched for a means which would enable him to write that epic. Williams would find in Zukofsky's poetics?especially in Zukofsky's emphasis on structure?one of his means to transform the limitations of the imagistic mode into the possibilities of the epic. In his Autobiography, Williams recalls that his first meeting with Zukofsky occurred at a time when Williams was "thinking, talking, writing constantly about the poem as a way of life."55 Of course, soon after their meeting in the late 1920s, Zukofsky began nA,n which was his own poem of a lifetime or "poem as a way of life." In his Autobiography, Williams succinctly sums up their relationship in the early 1930s by outlining their endeavor?along with Basil Bunting, Charles Reznikoff, and George Oppen?to create an objectivist poetics. Williams recounts, "We together inaugurated, first, the Objectivist theory of the poem, and then the Objectivist Press. Three or four books were published, including my own Collected Poems. Then it folded."56 Williams seems to dismiss the project, for "nothing much happened in the end."57 And, indeed, in 1948 when Williams wrote his Autobiography, Zukofsky probably encouraged him to dismiss the project. Years afterwards, in an interview with L.S. Dembo, Zukofsky denied that he had inaugurated any real Objectivist movement, for, as he stated, "some of us were writing to say things simply so that they will affect us as new again."58 Moreover, he added that he felt dubious about burdening any poet with "blasted terminology" or "any of those isms," for "you start becoming a balloon instead of a person."59 Nonetheless, Williams and Zukofsky certainly did not dismiss their Objectivist project in the 1930s. In a 17 March 1937 letter to Zukofsky, Williams wrote, "We have developed, in Objectivism, an important step toward a full understanding of what modern poetry is attempting and 54 Pound/Zukofsky, p. 78.

It is the inevitableness of it that impresses me."60 And, in fact, in the early 1930s, Zukofsky was hoping to herald a new age of Objectivist poetry; as he wrote to Pound: "Think 1*11 have as good a x movement' as that of the premiers imagistes."61 Regardless of his later feelings, however, Zukofsky certainly felt at the time that he was announcing a program of ideas. In 1930, at Pound's urging, Harriet Monroe asked the young poet to edit an edition of Poetry. According to Zukofsky, since Monroe insisted that he have a movement and, more so, that he give that movement a name, Zukofsky invented the term "Objectivist." But it was not merely the Objectivist movement that Zukofsky initiated in order to appease Monroe; for when Zukofsky compiled the poems for the 1931 Objectivist issue of Poetry, he included?certainly without any coercion?a theoretical explanation entitled "Program: ^Objectivists' 1931." And soon after his Poetry issue was published, Zukofsky published An nObjectivistsn Anthology, which he prefaced with an article?one may say a "manifesto"?citing his program. Soon after that, Williams and Zukofsky began their Objectivist Press. Despite Williams' and Zukofsky's dismissal of the Objectivist project?that "nothing much happened"?their activities point to the contrary. We may wonder what caused them to retreat from their initial impetus to excite poetic reform. During this flurry of activity, Zukofsky discovered that he had not inaugurated a new age in poetry, but rather had invited a whole host of challenges to his program?and the strongest came from his potential supporter, Harriet Monroe. After reading Zukofsky's issue of Poetry, Monroe was dismayed and angered and sent a challenge to the young rebel. In the next issue, she aimed a sharp rebuke entitled "The Arrogance of Youth" at Zukofsky.62 She scolded him for consigning poets to "outer darkness" because they did not "fit into a theoretic scheme spun out of brain fabric by a group of empirical young rule-makers."63 Moreover, she questioned whether or not Zukofsky's Objectivist principles were unique to his elect. She argued that a whole group of poets?not only the proponents of objectivism?were concerned with the "objectively perfect" or interested in "clear and vital particulars." Furthermore, she complained that Zukofsky was simply revamping well- known literary truisms into his "gaseous definitions": "And," she continued, "what is objectification but our old friend imagination, somewhat circumscribed and specialized?"64 60 Letter of 17 March 1937 from Williams to Zukofsky, HRC.

STANLEY Zukofsky smarted from Monroe's well-aimed rebuke. And her criticism of his "gaseous definitions" was justified, for Zukofsky, in the process of developing his own poetics, was still caught within the language of his predecessors. Like them, Zukofsky was interested in the clarity and precision of words; yet at the same time that he talked about the poem as an object, he also set that object in the midst of a context and an ongoing process. Rather than narrowing his definitions, Zukofsky was interested in making them inclusive. When Williams, at several different times, asked Zukofsky for a further delineation of the Objectivist theory, Zukofsky became increasingly vague, until he finally replied that all good poets from Homer on had been good Objectivists. However, when Lorine Niedecker asked Zukofsky for a definition in the 1930s, he gave a much more specific reply: "The Objectivists unlike the Imagists were quite contemporary, unfastidious &amp; inclusive in their selection of images . . . And in another respect the Obj. go beyond the Imag. Both by the choice of subjects &amp; by the implication which are allowed to appear from the image, the Obj. suggest the direction of the streams of objects, facts, situations, incidents, the tendency in things which we call history. And by the sequences and juxtapostion of images in their poems and by the cadences of their phrases, they suggest their own judgment on history."65 In his statement to Niedecker, Zukofsky makes it clear that part of his Objectivist definition involves a distinction of his practice from Imagist principles. Williams similarly asserted that the poem should be "treated and controlled" as an object?"but not as in the past."66 For the Objectivist, the crucial question is where poets would go from Imagism. Williams attempts to define the Objectivist goal: "The poem being an object (like a symphony or cubist painting) it must be the purpose of the poet to make of his words a new form: to invent, that is, an object consonant with his day. This was what we wished to imply by Objectivisim, an antidote, in a sense, to the bare image presented by loose verse."67 In his letter to Niedecker, Zukofsky, however, goes further in his solution to their dilemma; he finds the answer in reconciling the image with history. The epic form?shaped by linguistic, rather than transcendent and psychological structures?would allow Zukofsky to incorporate the "tendency in things which we call history" into his poetry. Zukofsky discovered at least the hazy outlines of his poetics in the late 1920s and early 1930s. It was during this period that he wrote Pound distinguishing his epic imagination from Williams' lyric imagination. Although one cannot help but hear?to use Monroe's phrase?the "arrogance of youth" in Zukofsky's tone, one must admit that 65 Letter circa 1937 from Zukofsky to Lorine Niedecker, HRC. Autobiography, p. 264. Autobiography, p. 265.</page><page sequence="19">WILLIAMS AND ZUKOFSKY 71 Zukofsky, in attempting to formulate his own critical and poetic language, needed to undergo a process of individuation. Williams, at the same time, was struggling with his own poetics which?as he wrote Zukofsky?was dominated by a desire for the whole: "Perhaps by my picayune, imagistic mannerisms I hold together superficially what should by all means fall apart."68 In developing the epic form of M," Zukofsky did allow his belief in the whole to fall apart. Unlike Williams, Zukofsky found his answer not in transformation?in which the parts cohere to a whole, a functional common reality?but in repetition and freeplay?in which signification is realized in an endless field of options. Within his poetic field of options, Zukofsky creates a system of words and structures which is not compelled to rely upon any particular referential system. Almost twenty years later, when Williams completed the first section of his own epic work, he would not be able to break away fully from his desire for the whole. Nevertheless, he seemed to be looking for a critical language which would enable him to complete his epic, Paterson?a conception he had held since the 1920s; and the language which was most pivotal to Williams' work was akin to Zukofsky's own critical language. When he was in the process of writing Paterson, Williams had already adopted several of Zukofsky's key concepts. In his 1948 talk "The Poem as a Field of Action," Williams writes, propose sweeping changes from top to bottom of the poetic structure. I said structure .... More has been done than you think about this though not yet been specifically named for what it is. I believe something can be said. Perhaps all that I can do here is to call attention to it: a revolution in the conception of the poetic foot?pointing out the evidence of something that has been going on for a long time.69 Of course, Williams is correct when he states that the "revolution of the poetic foot" has been "going on for a long time": to see the instigation of the revolution, one need only look at Pound's Imagistic verse or Williams' Spring and All, or one could, of course, travel further back to Whitman's pioneering free verse. But in this passage, Williams emphasizes not only the poetic foot, but the poetic structure, demonstrating that his interest in the all-encompassing vision of the eternal moment in Spring and All has given way to a discourse about poetic structure. Williams' language in this passage resonates with Zukofsky's own theoretical language of the early 1930s. In his "Objectivist" article, the young Zukofsky emphasizes the importance of "resolving of words and their ideation into structure" and of perceiving Selected Letters, p. 103.

(Prepositions, p. 13) Of course, in part, Zukofsky's article is a justification for his own epic poem M," in which he constructs a "personal structure of relations." Twenty years after Zukofsky began M," Williams would publish the first book of Paterson, a work which had its inception in the 1920s. The key factor which would allow Williams to tranform his lyric impulse into an epic one was his concept of structure. As Williams says in "The Poem as a Field of Action," "Imagism was not structural: that was the reason for its disappearance."70 The relationship of Zukofsky and Williams reflects the struggle of two poets to come to terms with the central questions of their poetics?demonstrating, indeed, in Williams' words, "that the thing [ongoing and everchanging literary movements] move by a direct relationship between men from generation to generation."71 When Williams died on 4 March 1963, Zukofsky responded by intertwining a coronal?a wreath of flowers?in memory of Williams through his MH 15- 17. In "4-7 7," subtitled a "Coronal for Floss," Zukofsky gives to Williams what he had asked for many years ago: a clear mirror. M-7 7" is a collage of texts?excerpts from Zukofsky's poetry, from Zukofsky's articles on Williams, from Williams' writings?which attest to Williams' and Zukofsky's thirty-five year relationship. Zukofsky's mirror is not Platonic, but textual, a mirror which reflects a life of language. Zukofsky ends his movement with a copy of a Williams signature, an inscription in a book which Williams had given him. Williams' identity has been caught in the signature, and such a signature has been more than a mere inscription, for this very special language has inscribed itself in Zukofsky's life work, his poetry, "a poem of a life."72 70 Williams, Selected Essays, p. 283. 71 Letter of Easter 1928 from Williams to Zukofsky, HRC.
