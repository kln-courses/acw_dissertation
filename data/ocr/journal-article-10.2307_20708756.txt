Fall 1997. 224-232. ] Bowne, Dostoevsky and Brightman: Three Personalists Who Confronted the Problem of Evil Joe BarnharP In 1909 Borden Parker Bowne published Studies in Christianity. It might well have been composed at the end of the twentieth century. Many of the issues he addressed continue to thrive among Christian theologians and scholars. Although at the turn of the century Bowne did not have the advantage of reading Tillich, Barth, Otto, Pannenburg and Moltmann, he did wrestle profoundly with the questions that later claimed their attention. Indeed, before Tillich was born and was writing about the Ground of Being, Bowne wrote profoundly of the world-ground.2 One of the most endearing things about Bowne as a writer is his remarkable clarity and briskness of style. He presents us with virtually none of Tillich's tortured prose. Bowne was studying in Dresden, Germany, when the Russian stylist and novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky was living there and beginning his novel The Idiot, a tragedy about a Christ like, beautiful person. At that time, Dresden was a sad town, bearing the 1 Joe Barnhart is Professor of Philosophy at the University of North Texas. Barnhart has published numerous books, articles, and reviews.

The hospitals overflowed with wounded soldiers, and the streets were filled with cripples and occupation soldiers.3 Bowne had gone to Germany to study the thoughts of Lotze, but he could not have failed to note the sufferings and horrors caused by the war. More than four decades later, in chilling but compelling words disturbingly similar to those of the tavern scene in which Ivan and Alyosha Karamazov discuss the problem of evil, Bowne wrote the following: A revelation of power and skill alone furnishes no basis for religion ... The advance of knowledge has revealed so many aspects of evil and so much that we cannot rationally interpret. We consider the raven and rapine of nature, the apparently meaningless aspects of things, also, and the long ages in which fire and slag and slime held barren sway. Of the lower forms of life, how few seem to have any meaning? We look at them in amazement and astonishment, and ask ourselves, How can these things be? Nor is human history much more intelligible. For the great masses of men there has been no history, but only animal need and craving, mostly unsatisfied. The many races, their alienations, their unending wars, their mutual slaughter, furnish a grim and difficult problem. And the few races which have climbed to some measure of civilization have soon grown weary of the burden as something too heavy to be borne . . . With our Christian faith we can indeed get on by postponing the problem and falling back on trust in God, but a purely inductive study without such faith could hardly fail to "lend evil dreams."4 In his notes for his novel, A Raw Youth, Dostoevsky presents a character who says that when two shopkeepers play a game of checkers, they do so with more wisdom and good sense than went into the creation 3 Geir Kjetsaa, Fyodor D?stoevsky: A Writer's Life (New York: Fawcett Columbine, 1987), 204. 4 Borden Parker Bowne, Studies in Christianity (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., 1909), 21-22.</page><page sequence="3">Bowne, D?stoevsky and Brightman 225 of the universe.5 Although this is not Dostoevski's view, it represents a rival position that plagued his mind most of his adult life. My coauthor L. L. Kraeger and I have argued that at least in The Brothers Karamazov D?stoevsky gives consistent voice to a metaphysics of personalism or panentheism, with the universe as God's body or perpetual incarnation.6 Yet in The Brothers Karamazov, the great Russian novelist wrestles heroically with the problem of evil. According to his second wife Anna, D?stoevsky was deeply disturbed by Holbein's painting Christus im Grabe-1 "Such a painting can make one lose one's faith," D?stoevsky said to Anna. The painting presents Christ enclosed in a kind of coffin, his mouth open, his eyes rolled back, his decaying body rigid and stark. In The Idiot, one of the characters expresses what is doubtless Dostoevsky's own reaction to the painting. I know that the early Church laid it down that Christ suffered actually and not symbolically. His body on the cross suffered according to the laws of nature. In the painting the face is terribly mangled and swollen, the whites [of the eyes] having a dead and glassy appearance. And so we are gripped by the thought, whether we like it or not, that there is no way to overcome the laws of nature or the horrors of death. If He could not overcome them, how could they ever be overcome? .. . But when we look at the painting, we see nature as some huge mechanical engine of modern days which has senselessly seized and crushed and swallowed up a great and precious Being, a Being worth all of nature and her laws, worth the entire earth, which was perhaps created merely for the sake of His coming. 5Fyodor Dostoevsky, The Notebooks for a Raw Youth, trans.

No one who gazes at the painting can escape the knowledge of this power.8 When Bowne considers empirically life's uncertainties and accidents of health and fortune, he acan discern no plan." What impresses him, rather, is "the sense of a blind fate or a blinder chance, which sports with men."9 Furthermore, a "purely logical study of the facts" sends the mind toward dismay rather than toward the conclusion that there exists a great and benevolent cosmic order. Least of all is any moral task disclosed.10 Much of Bowne's metaphysics of personalism may be viewed as an attempt to refute the view that the source of human life and values is a blind, dumb, eternal unreasoning power called nature. And he clearly does not hold that this dumb power is the ultimate word. To Bowne's credit, however, he does not deny that nature appears on the surface at least to be blind in the sense of having no overriding goal worthy of a moral, rational being. His first step toward overcoming the view that dumb nature alone is the final and efficient cause of our being is found in his revised book Metaphysics: "We must rise from the world of lumps into the world of energy."11 Later we learn that, for Bowne, nature is God's energizing. On the surface at least, Bowne had no more truck with natural theology than had Protestant theologian Karl Barth. My former professor Richard M. Millard once suggested that Bowne's view of nature was positivistic, and I think this is largely a correct reading. I cannot help but wonder if this positivistic approach to nature was Bowne's way of dealing with "the woe and horror" in the phenomena called nature.12 He pronounces nature to be "only a fiction of unenlightened thought." Indeed, "all that remains of nature is the phenomenal order." Bowne thus rejects 8Fyodor Dostoevsky, The Idiot, Part III, Chapter vi. 9Bowne, Studies in Christianity, 22. l0Ibid., 23. 11 Borden Parker Bowne, Metaphysics, rev. ed.

If Guthrie is correct in his thesis that religion is fundamentally the perpetuation of the species' ancient anthropomorphic habit,14 then theistic personalism is religious metaphysics. Far from trying to deny personalism's religious roots, however, Bowne insists that without divine revelation we would never have access to the key that allows us to interpret nature properly. Without the doctrine of divine unity that rose mainly through the influence of Christian teaching, neither personalism nor rational science could have emerged and survived. Bowne goes still further to contend that all of nature's details turn out to be manifestations of divine purpose, so that it is "doubtful that nature has any proper energy whatever in itself."15 Since the order of nature-this "phenomenal order"-is to be interpreted as God's work, it is important, Bowne says, to study the world and thus how "God works in it."16 Instead of flinching at the charge of anthropomorphism, Bowne counters by charging that the principle of natural selection carries its own strain of anthropomorphism. Furthermore, when stripped of anthropomorphism and ambiguity, the principle of selection comes close to being an empty, if not circular, abstraction. What it needs, Bowne contends, is an intelligent way of talking not only of the survival of the fit, but the arrival of the fit. Indeed, he goes so far as to contend that "nature has neither existence nor meaning except for and through intelligence."17 Now, it seems to me that Bowne has posed a problem for his theistic personalism, a problem that his student Edgar Sheffield Brightman faced with unrivaled candor. Brightman knew, of course, that Bowne had by 1909 embraced both the general conception of evolution and the doctrine of divine immanence. Bowne had also severely criticized deism with its ulbid., 56-58. 14 Steward Elliott Guthrie, Faces in the Clouds: A New Theory of Religion (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), chap. 7. 15 Studies in Christianity, 57. 16Ibid., 58. ^Metaphysics, 279f.</page><page sequence="6">228 Joe Barnhart "absentee God and a mechanical universe."18 It seems, therefore, that nature would turn out to be, for Bowne, not a mere "phenomenal order" but something so intimately a part of God as to reflect something of the divine being itself. Indeed, Brightman spells this out clearly in his Person and Reality - In the past, philosophers and theologians have often spoken of the immanence of God in nature. Such language suggests that nature is something external to God, into which he enters or in which he may dwell. But personalism leads to the insight that nature is nothing foreign to God, but is one of the areas of his personality. Hence it becomes more reasonable to speak of the immanence of nature in God then of the immanence of God in nature.19 Bowne, having said that nature in itself is so meaningless as to strike fear in some, would seem to be driven to acknowledge that nature manifests more of God than divine order. If, as he contends, "God is working through the law and the order which he has made," what can be said of the seemingly discordant aspects of the world?20 Bowne seems to have a positivistic view of nature only in the sense that he will not permit anything learned from nature to reflect on the life of God. Nature carries no metaphysical import. Rather, for Bowne, the task of metaphysics is to inform us as to the cause and meaning of nature.21 To be sure, nature is the expression of the divine will, but Bowne does not permit us to think that the "woe and horror" of nature might reflect something about God's own being. Apparently, nature can reveal God's behavior to some extent, but not his life, which Bowne tends to wrap in mystery. But is this the old dualism of (1) God's manifest being and (2) God's hidden aseity?22 Indeed, 18 Studies in Christianity, 64, 74. 19Edgar Sheffield Brightman, Person and Reality: An Introduction to Metaphysics, ed.

Clark's Religion, Reason, and Revelation</page><page sequence="7">Bowne, Dostoevsky and Brightman 229 it is a question as to whether, or at least to what extent, Bowne subscribes to what Protestant theologians have called general revelation. That is, what is it that general revelation discloses about God? If Bowne's comments about religion in India, Egypt, Central and Western Africa, as well as "the nations and races that have lived on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea" are to be taken at face value, he sees very little disclosure in religion apart from special revelation. In other words, general revelation at best has been meager, causing us to respond with "great disquietude of spirit."23 By contrast, special revelation has been progressive and fruitful. By special revelation, Bowne means the divine disclosure "in the historical movement out of which the Bible came."24 We may "trace its progress, like a mighty gulf-stream, through the ocean of human history ... God has been revealing himself and establishing a divine kingdom in the earth." The Bible is not so much the Word of God, therefore, as the product of an historical movement. It is also the historical and literary record.25 Bowne makes no secret of his conviction that great ideas, like great works of art, do not appear out of the blue. The special biblical tradition may not have generated great works of art, but it did, Bowne insists, produce "great, fruitful, living, and life-giving ideas concerning God and his purposes."26 But even in special revelation there are more than hints that God's own life is not the perfect bliss that Aristotle and Thomas imagined. Bowne himself says that behind the "woe and horror" is God "the Chief of burden-bearers, and the Leader of all in self-sacrifice."27 This comes close to Brightman's notion of the cross existing in the heart of God. Bowne, like A. C. Knudsen, did not embrace an explicit doctrine of the non-rational Given as a part of the divine nature. But he did take (Philadelphia: Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing Co., 1961), 222. For a critique of the two wills theory, see my Religion and the Challenge of Philosophy (Totowa, N.J.: Littlefield Adams &amp; Co., 1975), 117f. 23 Studies in Christianity, 22. 24Ibid., 44. 25Ibid., 42. 26Ibid., 44. 21 Ibid., 25.</page><page sequence="8">230 Joe Barnhart seriously much of the theory of evolution, which, he writes, "has made us familiar with the thought of slow progress in human developments as well as elsewhere."28 Bowne has seen through the barren view that Alvin Plantinga later tried to set forth as Reformed epistemology, according to which an Adam and Eve polluted the primordial state that contained neither moral evil nor epistemological flaw. According to Bowne, such a sinless and errorless state has never existed for the human species. Bowne knows he must somehow explain how in the world created by a perfect God, a species like ourselves emerged in a state that rendered life at every level so filled with conflict and apparent suffering and despair. There is, to be sure, widespread cooperation and alliance-making in nature's offspring, but the evolved cooperation often makes possible even greater conflict. Bowne makes much of God's unity as the World-Ground of nature and of all that evolves from nature. But as a personalist, he is committed to a relationship between God and nature that implies that the workings of nature reveal something about the inner life of God, although I am not sure that Bowne sees clearly that this is so. I know of no philosopher, psychologist, or theologian who has written more profoundly than Bowne on the subject of atonement. It is a mountain peak of moral reasoning. Indeed, there are insights in the second chapter of Studies in Christianity from which naturalists could borrow with considerable enrichment of their own position. In discussing vicarious suffering (not to be confused with vicarious punishment), Bowne expounds movingly on the "solidarity of life and especially the solidarity of love."29 He comes close to speaking of God's solidarity with nature, not in pantheistic absorption, but in the personalistic mode. But this solidarity would seem to imply that some of the suffering of the creatures that emerge from nature manifest to some extent the divine suffering. I believe Bowne accepts that there is divine suffering.30 If he does, then there is no sound reason for denying that there is also conflict in God. Brightman and Peter Bertocci are more explicit than Bowne in acknowledging this divine conflict. Brightman writes: 28 Ibid., 74. "Ibid., chap. 2. ?OIbid., 25.</page><page sequence="9">Bowne, Dostoevsky and Brightman 231 This dark aspect of religion [expounded by R. Otto and J. Boehme] points to a tragic reality in God. God is not simply a happy, loving Father; he is the struggle and the mysterious pain at the heart of life. He is indeed love; but a suffering love that redeems through a Cross.31 In The Brothers Karamazov, Dostoevsky wrestles with the notion of ultimate harmony. Ivan insists that the harmony demands too great a price. I do not have space here to explore Dostoevsky's attempt to answer Ivan, who in some ways may be seen not as an atheist, but as a would-be deist who thinks this world is unworthy of God. Through the elder Zosima, Dostoevsky develops what Kraeger and I conclude to be a doctrine of God's perpetual incarnation in nature. Like Bowne, Dostoevsky believed the Christ was in some sense a further extension of the incarnation. Kraeger and I refer to this as Dostoevsky's involvement theory of Christ's atonement, a theory quite similar to Bowne's. Dostoevsky could, I believe, agree with Bowne's view of salvation as an intrapersonal process. If there be any salvation, then, it must necessarily be of grace and not of debt. But salvation itself has often been mechanically, and even magically, conceived. ... It is God's aim to save men from sin, not from penalty; to recover men to righteousness, not to plant them in heaven. Forgiveness and salvation must be interpreted in accordance with this fundamental fact.32 But to accomplish this goal, God must be perpetually involved in his creation. The involvement theory of incarnation is, I think, taken so seriously by personalists like Brightman and Bertocci that they postulate that in God exist eternal and uncreated processes of nonrational consciousness which exhibit all the ultimate qualities of sense objects (qualia), disorderly impulses and desires, such experiences as pain and suffering, the 31 E.

For The Given to be in consciousness at all means that it must be in process; but unwilled, nonvoluntary consciousness is distinguishable from voluntary consciousness, both in God and man.33 Bowne wrestled with this involvement theory in several books and chapters, including the magnificent chapter "God and the World."34 No one who studies carefully this chapter could fail to conclude with the naturalist Morris Cohen that Borden Parker Bowne remains as "one of the keenest of American metaphysicians."35 33Brightman, A Philosophy of Religion, 336f, cited with approval by Peter Bertocci in his Introduction to the Philosophy of Religion (New York: Prentice Hall, Inc., 1951), 434. 34 Theism, chap. 5. 35 Morris.
