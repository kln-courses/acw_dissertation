Yet inside the walls of the Texas Department of Corrections, an elderly inmate produced a fascinating group of drawings that represent a unique blend of African-American traditions and his own vision. Frank Jones (ca. 1900- 1969) had a brief artistic career, spanning only the last five years of his life. Jones received no formal art training but worked intuitively, formulating an original and fluent visual language to express his beliefs and experiences. His powerful drawings serve as important documents of African-American aesthetic and cultural traditions, and they are a strong testament to the significance of the visionary experience as a source for black folk artists. While the visionary impulse in works by self-taught artists has been the subject of a growing number of exhibitions and publications, some questions remain about what exactly constitutes visionary art. In the exhibition catalogue for Black History/Black Vision: The Visionary Image in Texas, visionaries are described as self- taught artists whose works portray things unseen or seen only by the artist. The visionary artist relies on dreams, visions, or religious revelations as his or her inspiration for making art, or he or she may be com- pelled or commanded by an outside force- usually God-to produce art. The resulting images represent religious andfolk beliefs, depict events associated with them, and sometimes, reinterpret history from the artist's distinctive cultural viewpoint. Often the works of art contain mysterious imagery associated with religious or mystical themes. To understand them the viewer must be able to look beyond the surface and have at least a basic knowledge of the cultural traditions they represent.' The importance of the visionary impulse in African-American folk art has not gone unnoticed. In 1980, the Corcoran Gallery of Art's seminal exhibition "Black Folk Art in America, 1930-1980" recognized the high incidence of visionary expres- sions among the twenty artists in the show. Jane Livingston noted in the exhibition catalogue that "virtually every artist in this exhibition claims to have been commanded by an inner voice or by God to make art," and co-curator John Beardsley concurred that numerous black artists shared a "reliance, even insistence, upon visions as the principal force behind the creation of their art. Visions recur as a theme in the countless variations in subject matter and style that characterize black folk art." Beardsley surmised that 65 American Art Drawings from the Devil House The Vision of Frank Jones</page><page sequence="3">black visionary art was often inspired by the need for a spiritual deliverance from the physical constraints of life. He found that "occasionally, the vision reinterprets history or reveals the supernatural. But most often, it promises redemption, describing a more perfect world."2 While the visionary tendency in African-American folk art has been acknowledged for some time, a notion "The visionary may be caught up in a dynamic process that can be as terrifying as it is enlightening. This psychic intensity is not something that can be left behind when they leave the studio." persists that visionaries are isolated, eccentric individuals whose art springs up arbitrarily, as if from within a cultural vacuum. In some instances, the works of art contain iconographies so personal they are seen as being accessible only to the artist. Often, when an artist's visual vocabulary is difficult to decode, or when the artist appears to be working outside the confines of a tradition, he or she is referred to as an "isolate" or "outsider" artist. But these terms deny the impor- tance of the artist's connection to ethnic or regional oral and visual traditions. Artists like Frank Jones who create their art while confined to institutions are especially subject to the outsider label. While acknowledging the extraordinary and unique inner vision of these artists, to achieve a better understanding of their art we also must be aware of the external sources that inform their artistic expressions. There has been an increasing awareness of cultural tendencies toward visionary experiences. In 1987, the exhibition "Baking in the Sun: Visionary Images from the South" recognized the predomi- nance of black artists in the exhibition: twelve of the sixteen artists in the show were African American. Maude Wahlman explained in the exhibition catalogue that African influences on African-American artists have been largely overlooked, resulting in a misunderstanding of black visionaries and the cultural references in their art. In many instances, artists have been mislabled "idiosyncratic" because they "could not always articulate the African traditions that shaped their visions, dreams, and arts." In 1989, the exhibition "Another Face of the Dia- mond: Pathways through the Black Atlantic South" examined the interna- tional continuity of African expressions. Iconographical elements, oral traditions, and spiritual beliefs from both sides of the Atlantic were examined and compared, revealing African-American visionary art as a New World manifestation of tradi- tional African spiritual ideas. The exhibi- tion "Black Art-Ancestral Legacy: The African Impulse in African-American Art," which also opened in 1989, juxta- posed African objects with those created by both self-taught and academically trained artists in North America. One of the issues explored by the exhibition was the act of art making as a visual extension of spiritual beliefs-a tradition deeply rooted in the African-American commu- nity and linked to sacred African practices.3 The widespread visionary phenomenon can be found in works of art as diverse as the individuals who create them, driven by forces ranging from inspiration to obsession. But whatever his or her motivation, the artist's belief in the vision is essential to the production of authentic visionary art. Andy Nasisse wrote in Baking in the Sun that whether they come from dreams, delusions or from trance-like visions, the images... reveal a rich fantasy life whose visions are 66 Spring 1993</page><page sequence="4">1 James Hampton, early 1950s, next to his Throne of the Third Heaven of the Nations Millennium GeneralAssembly, ca. 1950-64.

National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution believed because we know thatfor the artist it is real. The visionary may be caught up in a dynamic process that can be as terrijfing as it is enlightening. This psychic intensity is not something that can be left behind when they leave the studio. It is not ajob. In some cases their art becomes the slender thread which ties them to the reality of the material world. Their art can be a device for struc- turing the chaotic realm of the subconscious, the world of dreams and visions.4 Some visionaries are compelled by an outside entity to produce art, often through a mystical revelation. William Edmonson of Tennessee began sculpting after he saw a vision of a tombstone in the sky and heard the voice of God command him to carve. The Louisiana visionary Sister Gertrude Morgan began producing her religiously inspired, often autobiographi- cal, paintings after she experienced a divine vision in which the Lord commanded her to express her faith through art.5 For others, making art is an act of transmittance, with the artist becoming the conduit through which divine mes- sages are relayed. Georgia artist J. B. Murray assumed the role of a spiritual medium through whom God relayed messages written in unknown lan- guages-the visual equivalent to speaking in tongues. These codes were deciphered through a divination process in which the artist, after asking "the Lord to witness this work for me in His water," viewed the pictures through a glass of water drawn from a well outside his home. James Hampton of Washington, D.C., also received artistic direction from his religious visions and transmitted divine messages through his art. During the fourteen years Hampton worked on his great construction, The Throne of the Third Heaven of the Nations Millennium GeneralAssembly, God gave him specific instructions each night on how to proceed (fig. 1). The 180 objects that compose The Throne are accompanied by a text written in a mysterious, undecipherable language.6 Often visionaries describe a physical force that actually moves their hand to make art. J. B. Murray spoke of the pencil moving itself as he drew, and Minnie Evans of North Carolina began making art when, she claimed, "something spoke to me like this, 'Why don't you draw or die?' Something had my hand." Evans attributed her art to dreams and "some- times day visions," stating, "I have no imagination.... They just happen. In a dream it was shown to me what I have to do of paintings."7 Quite commonly, visionaries have the ability to see anthropomorphic forms in roots, limbs, and driftwood-materials held sacred by African artists for their great spiritual powers. Artists Bessie Harvey, Jesse Aaron, Sam Doyle, and Willard "The Texas Kid" Watson are among many who echo the belief that their role is to develop into a work of art a form created by nature or by God. Frank Jones occupied another point along this visionary continuum. Jones remained in control of his art making, but like William Edmonson he depicted images that appeared to him in super- natural visions. Like Minnie Evans, Jones reported dreaming about pictures at night. But the genesis of Jones's art making related to an African-American 67 American Art</page><page sequence="5">spiritual belief that formed an important part of the artist's personal identity.8 Frank Albert Jones was born around the year 1900 in Clarksville, the county seat of Red River County, Texas. Clark- sville had a population of 2,069 in 1900. Approximately twenty miles to the north He described his double-sightedness as "looking through a hole" into the spirit world. of Clarksville, the course of the Red River determines the border between Texas and Oklahoma. Eighty miles to the southeast lies the point where Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana meet. The area surrounding Clarksville had proved ideal for cotton cultivation, and it had been one of the state's major plantation districts. Follow- ing emancipation, rural isolation and racial segregation continued to nurture the old African-American traditions that flourished with the crops in the fertile East Texas river bottoms. In this environment Frank Jones's belief system was formed. His drawings.both reflected and played a vital role in his spiritual beliefs. When Jones was a small child, his mother told him that he was born "with a veil over his left eye" and that this veil would enable him to see spirits. The spirit veil is a well-documented and widespread African-American folk belief. People born with the veil or caul (part of the fetal membrane) over their eyes were believed to have the power to see and to communi- cate with spirits. Such people were called "double-sighted." Numerous stories appear in southern black folklore regard- ing double-sighted individuals and their extraordinary experiences. Beliefs con- necting events of childbirth to future powers belong to the myriad African traditions that permeate African-American culture.9 Jones was around nine years old at the time of his first spirit sighting. He described his double-sightedness as "looking through a hole" into the spirit world. Throughout his life he continued to see the supernatural creatures that he called interchangeably "haints" (haunts), "devils," or "haint-devils." They appeared in various forms, including male and female devils of many nationalities, animals, and inanimate objects. African- American folklore contends that haints can take any form at will, from everyday objects to the fantastic creatures that appear throughout Jones's work. Jones himself explained, "Sometimes they just look like devils, but they can come in any form; a woman, a man, a dog, a chair." Jones believed the haints were everywhere but that they remained invisible to those who were not born with a veil.'0 Jones claimed to have begun drawing pictures at about the time of his first spirit encounter. He said that his drawings were always of devil houses and that he never drew any other subject matter. If he was making art from childhood, no work from this period is known to survive. We have little information on Frank Jones's early years. Like many black Texans of his generation, he never attended school or learned to read or write. He worked as a farm laborer and a yard man, and occasionally he traveled to nearby towns picking up odd jobs. As the result of an unfortunate series of events, Jones spent some twenty years in and out of Texas prisons. Around 1935, Jones took in a young girl who had been abandoned. In 1941 the girl's mother returned to claim her, but when Jones refused to surrender the child, the child's mother charged him with rape. Jones pleaded innocent but was handed a sentence of two to five years imprison- ment. He served two years in the Red River County Jail before being transferred 68 Spring 1993</page><page sequence="6">to the state penitentiary. Two months later he was discharged, and he returned to Clarksville." His troubles, however, were far from over. In 1945, Jones married Audrey Culberson. Audrey had two grown sons, Charlie and James Earl, who lived with the couple. According to Jones, the two "were lazy and lived off us.... They wouldn't work, but wanted nice things." Tragedy struck on the evening of 10 July 1949, when Della Gray, an elderly black Clarksville woman, was murdered in her home during an apparent robbery at- tempt. James Earl Culberson was arrested and charged with the crime, but he implicated Jones. Both Culberson and Jones pleaded innocent, but both were found guilty of the charges against them. Culberson received a twenty-five-year sentence, and Jones was sentenced to life in prison. Jones believed that James Earl and Charlie had robbed and murdered Della Gray. He later told a prison psy- chologist, "The devils got into those boys and one night they went to her house and killed her . .. and stole her money."12 Jones served nine years of his sentence in the Texas penitentiary before being paroled, and again he returned home to Clarksville. In 1960, however, Jones was accused of rape in a case that was never brought to trial. Jones denied the charges, which he claimed originated with an enemy, but was returned to prison as a parole violator (for being charged with a crime) to serve out his life sentence. He always maintained that he was innocent of all charges and had "no business" being in prison.'3 Sometime after 1960, while serving his life sentence at the main unit of the prison system, known as "the Walls," in Huntsville, Jones began salvaging paper and stubs of red and blue colored pencils discarded by prison bookkeepers to draw pictures of the haints he saw as the result of his veil. Jones called his drawings "devil houses." Haints were very much a part of Jones's world. He once commented, "I draw them as I see them."14 Jones and his unusual pictures became a source of amusement for guards and inmates alike around the prison. One prison employee remembered that Jones "used to sit out in front of the office and draw those devils and angels, and frankly, we all thought he was a little strange.""5 In July 1964 the Texas Department of Corrections organized its first annual inmate art exhibition as "part of the prison's rehabilitation program designed to foster and build worthwhile interests and values among the inmates."'6 A prison guard entered one of Jones's drawings in the show, partially in jest, but also "to make him feel good."17 Much to everyone's surprise, Jones's small drawing captured the interest of the judges, art faculty from Sam Houston State Teachers College in Huntsville. Jones's work was selected to win first prize. Among the visitors to the inmate show was Murray Smither, a Huntsville native and employee of the Dallas art gallery Atelier Chapman Kelley. Smither pur- chased one of Frank Jones's drawings and took it back to Dallas. The gallery's owner, Chapman Kelley, also recognized the unique quality of the work and decided that the gallery should represent Jones. Almost immediately, Kelley began supplying Jones with art supplies. In November 1964, only three months after the inmate art show, Jones's first solo exhibition was held at the Atelier Chapman Kelley. With the continued support of the gallery, his work soon began appearing in and receiving awards at juried exhibitions throughout the country. For the next five years Jones continued to make art, producing a cohesive body of work estimated at several hundred drawings. Jones's devil houses contain an iconog- raphy reflecting the artist's special vision and personal experiences combined with broader, culturally based elements of his 69 American Art</page><page sequence="7">2 French House, 1965-66. Colored pencil on paper, 24 x 22 5/8 in. Estate of Frank Jones, Chicago belief system. Jones began by drawing horizontal and vertical lines that would form architectural structures viewed in cross-section. He divided the devil house structures into compartments, or rooms, bordered by sharp claw shapes that made the houses impenetrable. Jones called these shapes "devils' horns." Double- edged, the devils' horns allowed neither entry nor escape. Within the rooms of the houses, grinning devil figures were at once confined and sheltered. The act of making art as symbolic protection from evil forces is an ancient African practice that persists today in African-American visionary art. By providing spirits with a dwelling place, as Jones did in his devil houses, they can be controlled and worshiped simultaneously. Jones neutralized the haints' powers and limited their activity by capturing them on paper and containing them within the devil house structures. Through his drawings, Frank Jones imposed order on a world over which he had little control. Yet even confined in the drawings, the evil energy with which Jones visually grappled remained powerful, occasionally threatening to emerge. The vibrating edges of Jones's devil houses leave open the potential for escape, and in some drawings the barriers begin to collapse as 70 Spring 1993</page><page sequence="8">3 Cell block, Texas Department of Corrections, Huntsville, Texas 4 Prison yard, Texas Department of Corrections, Huntsville, Texas fluttering haints break away from the houses, defying restraint (fig. 2). Jones believed in haints, and although they appeared harmless in his drawings, they posed a real and constant threat. Jones once commented, "I think about the devil quite a bit. I'm always trying to keep him away from me." Although Jones depicted the haint figures smiling, they were anything but benign. He explained that the haints smile "to get you to come closer ... to drag you down and make you do bad things. They laugh when they do that." On another occasion, Jones said they smile because "they're happy, waiting for your soul."18 Jones's devil houses achieve a precarious sense of balance that is based on the tension of opposing elements. By alternating the colors red and blue and the direction of the devils' horns, Jones created the surface pattern and the internal rhythm of his drawings. At the beginning, the drawings were red and blue due to the artist's access to found materials; later, this color scheme became a conscious aesthetic decision. By late 1964 the Atelier Chapman Kelley was providing Jones with pencils and paper, and he began to experiment, adding a variety of other colors to the drawings. But Jones did not like the other colors, and soon he returned to blue and red, which he said represented smoke and fire.19 The colors red and blue are imbued with spiritual significance in both African and African-American lore. The combina- tion of blue, the favorite color of the Yoruba people of Africa (suggesting the qualities of gentleness and submission), and red (identified with power and spiritual command) allude to the coexist- ence of dual, opposing forces.20 These colors, which continue to hold symbolic spiritual power for blacks in the New World, are found repeatedly and in diverse locations. Red and blue are important protective colors, for example, in the vodun religion, which originated among African slaves in Haiti. Commonly known as voodoo, by the early nineteenth century vodun had found its way to New Orleans, from where it spread throughout the southern United States. Not surpris- ingly, red and blue appear as a favorite color scheme in Georgia Sea Island quilts, where they suggest "the binary opposites hot/cool, good/bad, safe/dangerous." Red signifies "danger, fire, conflict, and passion," and blue is "a good color used ... to keep away bad spirits."21 The structure of the devil house, with its multi-storied rows of compartments, was evidently inspired by the prison (fig. 3). Like the sometimes dangerous indi- viduals who inhabited Jones's physical world in the prison, the haints were confined in rows of small compartments to neutralize their behavior. Other iconographic elements in Jones's works are also traceable to his material environ- ment. Jones included clocks in nearly half of his drawings. The clock, an icon of time and its passage, is also a symbol of imprisonment (prison slang for incarcera- tion is "doing time" or "serving time"). The image also represents a specific clock in the prison yard that Jones believed was "hainted" (fig. 4). In the early works containing clocks, time seems to stand still, but in later works the hands of the clocks develop multiple appendages that seem to spin uncontrollably, an apparent reference to the artist's increasing aware- ness of his mortality as his health began to fail and his requests for parole were repeatedly denied. The circle bisected by a cross is a protective device found throughout African-American visionary art. This motif, which derives from Kongo cosmic symbols related to the spirit world,22 appears repeatedly throughout Jones's drawings, often at the center of a pin- wheel suggesting the motion of time or perhaps the orbiting of a celestial body. Another common motif in Jones's work is the pair of dice.

Estate of Frank Jones, Chicago the dice may also relate to the artist's conflict with a world of random forces: often a sizzling, electric energy radiates from the dice as if to signal these forces. Jones's earliest extant works date from 1964. These small-scale works were rigidly drawn, red and blue colored-pencil drawings on ordinary typing paper. They Frank Jones created a body of art that reflected his perception of the spiritual energies andpowers of the universe and of his own place among them. depict simple structures populated only by minimal figures. Three Story Military Drilling House represents this initial phase (fig. 5). The drawing contains two circles at the center of what look like sunbursts, located inside triangular shapes that form the gables of the house. These empty circles anticipate the clocks that would soon appear in his work. A solitary haint shown in profile inhabits one of the rooms. Jones signed the work at the bottom with his prison inmate identifica- tion number, 114591. As Jones's career rapidly developed, his style flourished along with his growing confidence. After the Atelier Chapman Kelley began supplying Jones with paper, his drawings became larger, increasingly elaborate, and more fluid. Jap Devil House, from 1964, already begins to show a considerable development in Jones's technique and style (fig. 6). Two elaborate haints in profile dominate the drawing, while a third perches on the roof of the house above a clock. Jones once described these unconfined figures as "old devils that sometimes sit on the top of the devil houses watching us all." In other rooms of the house we see bursting or flaming objects that could represent cosmic entities or perhaps additional haints appearing in this form. In his research of African-American folklore in the 1920s, Newbell Niles Puckett found that although haints sometimes appear in animal form, "white spots, vapor or balls of fire are more common."23 As before, Jones signed the work with his prison number. By 1965-66 Jones had hit his stride as an artist. The drawing Indian House represents this phase of Jones's career (fig. 7). In this work we find a variety of haint species, their activity anchored by the strength of the structure. Two haints on the roof remain attached to the house by 72 Spring 1993</page><page sequence="10">7 (Overleaf) Indian House, ca. 1968-69.

Estate of Frank Jones, Chicago their positions on either side of a curious clock with double numerals. By the time he completed this work, Jones had learned to write his name, which would replace the prison number with which he signed earlier works. He varied the spelling of his name from drawing to drawing; in the case of Indian House, it is "Jones Srank." Jones's compositions became increas- ingly elegant and flowing as the devil- horn shapes began to curve inward and outward, interacting gracefully with each other. Within their confines, haints fluttered and gyrated. Moon Devils represents Jones at the height of his artistic output (fig. 8). Jones successfully exploited the character of his medium in the quick, vibrating marks that compose the quivering devil figures, which appear translucent and ghostlike. Graceful shapes hang swaglike from the ceilings of the houses, and crescent shapes represent the moon. As Jones's style continued to develop, the drawings became increasingly de- tailed, reaching in the years 1966-68 a crescendo of pattern and decoration and becoming "catalogues" of haint types, as in Wagon Wheel Devil House (fig. 9). Although a multitude of haints activate the interior of the house, they remain safely contained within the solid struc- ture. Jones has placed the house on tiny 73 American Art</page><page sequence="11">-if r\C $1IP1_ 8lffe -5 P_ JI -i-_El??li?r_li%?CQYh_sl LiSI --r IP__?+1;51 Pip e I Is_ atli 78' $ ld II a 2me LL -.II --77 P blli i L LTcP?9 Sjj , I i-- 2 1 i '?r rs C II .:gP ra?eg 8' -9? .j E ' ; 3Ei 6 : :&amp; -n L1C at iLb 'i, 4-iii krr L 1, ,, 51sociFs sVj I= i 6` -B!, ,. i F di: =il F=--? - -J P ,h!= g , *aL;' eP~~a a : E P1 Be :L--1- i"-- L;ES;P g fAii"rrnr rrr 1 Ic; s nr mr ""Z- 7-ia-oassou_c:.

The clock in this work has degenerated, creating a sense that time is totally out of control. In this work, as in others dated between 1966 and 1968, the devil-horn shapes have stripes, and the overall composition seems to be an exercise in pattern and decora- tion. It is uncertain how many more drawings Jones made after Wagon Wheel Devil House, but his creation of a "mobile home" could certainly be seen as a formal culmination of the devil house theme. During the five years that constituted his art career, Jones captured his haints and imposed order on his world through his drawings. He also continued to dream of the day when he would be released from prison and return to the free world. Throughout his imprisonment, Jones never wavered from his claim of inno- cence of the crime for which he was sentenced to life imprisonment. Chapman Kelley began a campaign to secure Jones's release from prison, enlist- ing the help of a sympathetic prison 75 American Art -toNES</page><page sequence="13">Frank Jones in his prison cell, Huntsville, Texas employee and, at one point, a state legislator. But this effort repeatedly failed. The continued denial of his requests for parole disappointed Jones greatly. Mean- while his health was declining, the result of advanced liver disease. Still he contin- ued to make art and to report to work each day. He distrusted the medical profession and refused treatment, fearing that if he entered the hospital he would not come out alive. Finally, his health worsened, and in early February 1969, Jones was admitted to the prison hospital. Frank Jones died on 15 February 1969 in the prison hospital in Huntsville without attaining his freedom. The money he earned from the sale of his drawings provided Jones with the Christian funeral he had requested. His body was returned to Clarksville for burial in the free world. During the final years of his life, Frank Jones created a body of art that reflected his perception of the spiritual energies and powers of the universe and of his own place among them. In his art, if not his life, Jones created at least a temporary balance of these forces. Jones's drawings not only provide us with a unique opportunity to view the process through which he achieved this balance, but also serve as important documents of African- American folk traditions. 76 Spring 1993</page><page sequence="14">Notes Earlier versions of this article appeared as a chapter on Frank Jones in Black History/Black Vision: The Visionary Image in Texas (Austin, Tex.: Archer M.
