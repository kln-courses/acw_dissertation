This research is being expanded to investigate THOR-50M in the  driver position in a 56 km/h frontal impact crash. Hybrid III 5th percentile adult female (AF05) anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs)  were used in this testing to evaluate the RibEye Deflection Measurement System. The AF05 ATDs were positioned in the right front  passenger and right rear passenger seating positions. For the right front passenger, the New Car Assessment Procedure (NCAP) seating  procedure was used, except the seat fore-aft position was set to mid-track. For the right rear passenger, the seating followed the  FMVSS No. 214 Side Impact Compliance Test Procedure. The NCAP frontal impact test procedure was followed with additional  vehicle instrumentation and pre/post-test measurements. Results from this test series were compared with previous NCAP crash tests.  The THOR-50M showed similar kinematics to the Hybrid III 50th but predicted a higher risk of chest and femur injury. The mid-track  seat position of the right front passenger AF05 led to lower levels of femur compression loading due to additional distance to the dash.  BrIC for the driver and front passenger showed higher injury risk than HIC15. In all vehicles, the rear seat AF05 predicted a  substantially higher risk of head, neck and chest injury than the right front passenger. The AF05 RibEye output showed a higher peak  deflection (x-axis) than the chest potentiometer.

Driver, shoulder belt force RESULTS Injury Criteria and Associated Injury Risk - THOR- 50M Occupant injury risk was assessed by determining the probability of a  given severity of injury based on the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS)  [4] [5]. For the head, neck, and chest, the probability of an AIS score  of three or higher (AIS ≥ 3) was calculated. For the femur, the  probability of an AIS score of two or higher (AIS ≥ 2) was calculated.

For all of the vehicles, the inclusion of BrIC head risk at least doubles  the joint probability of injury over NCAP tests. The AF05 positioned in the right rear seat had higher injury risk  calculated from HIC15, Nij and chest compression than the right front  passenger. The joint probability of injury ranged from 3.8 to 6.2 times  greater than the front passenger. The maximum RibEye deflection  was greater than the chest pot and there were some RibEye signal  drop-outs during tests.
