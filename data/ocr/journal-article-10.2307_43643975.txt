<plain_text><page sequence="1">Checks on the Abuse of Political Power in some African States: A Preliminary Framework for Analysis By J. H. M. B e a 1 1 i e I. Older writers about primitive states in Africa and elsewhere often spoke of chiefs and kings as possessing absolute power. But it is plain from the more thorough ethnography of the past half century or so that in fact the authority of such rulers is generally restricted by a wide range of social institutions. There has as yet been little attempt to classify these, and in this article, on the basis of the published material on a few African states, I attempt a preliminary classification of those social institutions which have the effect of restraining those persons in whom political power is vested from abusing that power. On the basis of such a classification it may be possible to suggest certain broad correlations between types of institutionalized control and kinds of political structure. Apart from any methodological and comparative interest which this enquiry may possess, it may have some practical relevance in that an understanding of indigenous political institutions and of the checks and balances which they embody is essential for the comprehension and control of social change. In what follows I deal only with checks which are social (psychological factors, important though they may be, are disregarded), institutionalized (that is, which are established and recognised features of the societies they occur in), and indigenous (checks imposed from outside, for example by foreign political or other agencies, are ignored). I do not consider "acephalous" societies: checks on the abuse of power by indigenous political authorities can only be studied where such) authorities exist. In this section, I examine briefly certain key concepts. These are power, authority, political, abuse (of political power) and restraint (of such abuse). (a) Power . Bertrand Russell has remarked that power, "the ability to do something or anything, or to act upon a person or thing"1, is the 1 Shorter Oxford Ehglish Dictionary.

Beattie fundamental concept in social science. It is, of course, a fundamental concept in all thought, for under its other name of causation it is how we understand change, the succession of events in time. A cause produces its effect, we suppose, because it has the power to do so, and with our unescapable anthropomorphism we commonly think of this power as a kind of latent ability to alter the existing state of things, such as we are conscious of in our own psychic experience. As Hume showed long ago, power is a purely subjective category; we are conscious of it in ourselves, but as far as the succession of events in the external world is concerned it is no more than a useful though rarely analysed hypothesis, a projection of our own experience, not something observed or induced from observation. So fundamentally power is human power, and human power is the conceived ability to produce intended effects, on oneself, on other human beings, or on things. In a sense a man may be said to have power to produce unintended effects, but this is not what we generally mean by human power, which is essentially directed. A man is thought powerful because he can produce intended results, not unintended ones. So the notion is essentially teleological. Men think of themselves as initiating action, determining not determined, and the conscious initiation of action is only intelligible in terms of a pre-perception of some end to be achieved. So a man has power in so far as he can do what he wants to do, and he has social power where in any human relationship he can make others do as he wants them to do2. Social power is thus not a substance or quality inherent in individuals qua individuals, but rather a special aspect of inter-personal relationships. (b) Authority . Unlike power, authority implies right; an armed raider may have power to relieve a shopkeeper of his day's takings, but he does so without authority. And right is a conceptual as well as a social entity; it must be acknowledged by somebody, and it exists only in that recognition3. So political authority is more than the mere ability to exercise power; it implies public acknowledgment. Where it exists in institutionalized form it is created and maintained by; the social group in which it occurs, and it implies the acceptance of a common system of values in which are included the institutional norms through which the authority is conceived and expressed4. Since 2 Cf. Weber (1947) p. 139: "power is the probability that one actor within a social relationship will be in a position to carry out his own will despite resistance, regardless of the basis upon which this probability rests". 3 Cf. Maclver (1947) p. 83: "an authority does not act in his private capacity, but always in virtue of a right conferred on him for this purpose by society". - Cf. also Michels (1937) p. 315: "whether authority is of personal or institutional origin it is created and maintained by public opinion". Ct. Parsons (1Ö41) p. 7bö.</page><page sequence="3">Checks on the Abuse of Political Power in some African States 99 authority implies acceptance, and since acceptance must have some ground, the concept of legitimacy may properly be regarded as the distinguishing feature of authority, as Weber showed5. Authority implies a claim to legitimacy and this claim must be acknowledged as valid by the persons subject to it. Basically, authority depends on the consensus of the community over which it is exercised. Thus the phrase "absolute authority" is strictly speaking a contradiction, for the very concept is a relative one, and refers not to a quality but to a relation. So social authority is the right, not the ability, to exercise power over others, and authority may exist without power, just as power may exist without authority. Since the exercise of some form of institutionalized social power is a condition of the maintenance of a stable system of ordered social relations, a primary concern of social authority is with the maintenance of social order. Social authority may, then, be defined as the right, vested in a certain person or persons by the consensus of a society, to make decisions, issue orders and apply sanctions in matters affecting other members of the society. Such matters will usually be concerned either directly or indirectly with the maintenance of social order. Any person or corporation of persons so vested may be called an authority. (c) Political. The concept "political" is more complex, at least in social anthropology. It is usually defined as having to do with the state, the state being defined as "the body politic as organized for supreme civil rule and government"6. Like other social concepts which have grown up in the context of Western history, this definition is too narrow to be useful when applied to some of the kinds of societies which anthropologists study. What we need are criteria for indentifying certain kinds of social phenomena, and we know that these occur even when the body politic is not so organized. Heller's definition of the state is more useful; for him it is "a territorial organization which is able to enforce its power as against all other associations and persons within its borders, and thus to regulate and give an integrated expression to the interrelated social activities of its inhabitants"7. Radcliffe-Brown adapts this classic formulation; he defines political organization as "the maintenance of social order, within a territorial framework, by the organized exercise of coercive authority through the use, or the possibility of use, of physical force"8. Here there are 5 Weber (1947) Chap. III. 6 Shorter Oxford English Dictionary. 7 Heller (1937) p. 301. 8 Radcliffe-Brown (1940) p. xiv. Cf. also Weber (1947) p. 141: for him the political group is "an imperatively coordinated [i. e. one subject to authority] corporate group in which order is enforced continuously within a given territorial area by the application and threat of force". 7*</page><page sequence="4">100 J. H. M. Beattie really two criteria; the means which characterise political activity, and the ends to which it is directed. The means are physical force or the threat of it, and for Weber this is definitive of the state, which cannot be defined in terms of its ends since it may assume any task9. The sole source of the right to use violence is the state, and others can do so only so far as it permits them. Of course Weber was thinking primarily of modern states, which exercise functions vastly more diverse than those of traditional African states. But, as Weber recognised, any state, if it is to survive, must include among its functions the maintenance of territorial order. So the chief end of political activity must be the regulation and control of the social order in a certain territory. The maintenance of this order must depend on a system of social institutions and the values these imply, so one of the things that political organization does is to maintain a body of interconnected moral and legal norms10. And it relates to all the members of the territorial group; it is, in Maclver's words, "the organ of the whole community"11. So a political authority is any person vested with the right to issue orders, administer sanctions, etc., in a certain territory, such activity being generally directed, and regarded as being directed, towards the maintenance of the existing social order, and being as a rule backed by the threat of physical force. Whenever such a person, in virtue of his office, effectively commands the service or the compliance of others he exercises political power, and his authority lies in the recognition of his right to do so. The determination of who is or is not to be regarded as a political authority in any particular situation is bound to be a little arbitrary. I have stressed that political power is not best regarded as an attribute which some individuals have and others have not; it is rather a particular category of relationship, in which an individual may stand in some contexts but not in others. The crucial criteria are the extent to which an individual or category of individuals is recognised as a political authority, and the importance of the political role he or it plays. Difficulty in determining who are and who are not political authorities is most likely to arise in the consideration of segmentary, "acephalous" societies, where there is little or no political specialization and no association which claims the monopoly of physical force. Such societies do not, of course, lack social order or structural continuity, and it is legitimate to speak of them as having political systems (in the sense that internal order and external relations are institutionally controlled), but they do not have »political authorities in the sense of that term above defined, and I am not concerned with them in this essay. 9 Weber (1948) p. 78. 10 Fortes and Evans-Pritchard (1940) p. 20. 11 Maclver (1947) p. 14.</page><page sequence="5">Checks on the Abuse of Political Power in some African States 101 (d) Abuse. The dictionary definition of the verb is "to misuse, to take a bad advantage of, to pervert". Its vahiational content is at once plain; abuse is bad. Since judgments as to what constitutes abuse in this sense and what does not must vary with the moral standpoint of the observer and his culture, this meaning of the term will not do for sociological analysis. Sociologically, we cannot mean by the abuse of political power its misdirection to morally reprehensible ends, or the use of it not in the best interest of those governed. Nor can we mean its use for a ruler's own private advantage at the expense of the general good, though no doubt this is what generally happens when political power is abused12. Like other men, a ruler is bound to be actuated some of the time by his private interests and to use his power to gratify these interests. But whether this constitutes abuse can only be decided by reference either to a subjective moral standard (which cannot provide an acceptable basis for sociological analysis), or to what is expected of the ruler, either by members of the society in which he exercises his authority or by somebody else. Only a criterion of this latter type can provide an adequate sociological meaning for the concept. The abuse of political power can only be studied objectively when it is taken to mean what some person or group of persons think to be abuse of political power. This person or group of persons may represent or compose the whole society, in which case public opinion will be the criterion, or it may stand outside the society (as for example a European official does in certain still dependent African societies). Naturally indigenous checks can only occur in the former case. For the purposes of the present analysis, therefore, abuse of political power may best be defined as the failure by a political authority to use such power in a manner which the community as a whole or its representatives regard as conforming to the duties and responsibilities of the office held. This negative formulation permits the inclusion of omissions as well as acts; political power is no less abused when a ruler fails to act in the manner socially prescribed for him than it is when he does something which he should not do. (e) Restraint. The notion of restraint or checking is, superficially at least, a simple one; an action or tendency to action is restrained when something occurs to stop it. It has long been recognised that political power is of " an encroaching nature" and so needs to be controlled, and this implies the exercise of counterbalancing power by persons or groups of persons other than the ruler. Power and authority are normally distributed, even in the most "absolute" states. But it is necessary to distinguish the limitation of power from its restraint. No doubt the fact that political authority is vested in other members 12 Cf. Fortes and Evans-Pritchard (1940) p. 17.</page><page sequence="6">102 J- H. M. Beattie of a community besides its political head constitutes a limitation on the latterà power. But in itself this can hardly be said to constitute a restraint or check, unless the other power-holding persons or groups can wield sanctions which restrain the ruler from deviating from the prescribed norms. So although the distribution of political power is important in delimiting the amount and scope of power held by any individual, and in determining the type of political organization, it is not in itself directly relevant to the narrower field of restraint. When I speak of social checks or restraints on the abuse of political power, I refer primarily to institutionalized social relationships between political authorities and other persons or groups of persons in the society, an effect of which is to prevent these authorities from behaving in a manner which the governed community or its representatives regard as not conforming to its conception of the duties and responsi- bilities of office. I am thus concerned with an aspect of the political structure, but not with the whole of it. II. In this section I examine the ethnographic literature relating to a few reasonably typical traditional African states (I have selected the Ganda, Swazi, Ashanti and Nupe kingdoms)13, with the aim of identifying and describing some social institutions which have the effect of preventing or restraining the abuse of political power. At once the social phenomena to which the framework sketched in the preceding section is applicable can be seen to fall into two broad types. First, there are certain enduring structural features of the society the very involvement in which of political authorities precludes certain types of abuse of power. Conformity with these normative institutions, for example with a political constitution, itself prevents the ruler from doing what he should not do. And conformity is obligatory; these norms are built into the social system and have the compelling force of law. We are thinking of such normative institutions when we speak, for example, of the common requirement that a king shall consult a body of advisers before taking administrative action. Of course this is only a check if the king does consult his councillors 13 The choice of these is not wholly arbitrary. They are in widely separate parts of the continent (one in east, one in south and two in west Africa); they all differ from one another in important respects; each exemplifies a generic type of African state; and the traditional political systems of all of them have been intensively (though by no means adequately) studied. It must be stressed again that what are considered here are the traditional ¡systems of these states, so far as they can be reconstructed; the present situation in all of them is of course something entirely different (though traditional values sometimes have more con- temporary significance than is always recognised).</page><page sequence="7">Checks on the Abuse of Political Power in some African States 103 and attend to their advice. But as long as he does so, it is proper to speak of the institution as a check upon abuse, whatever the sanctions by which deviation from the norm is penalised. Such factors of restraint may conveniently be called categorical norms, for they are built into the political system as standardised, compulsory ways of acting. Though they may be and no doubt usually are subject to social sanctions14, they are not themselves sanctions. The second type of checks on the abuse of political power comprises those which become effective only when an established norm is breached. They need not be any less institutionalized, for the likelihood of their being brought into effect is recognised by everybody, and the recognition of this no doubt makes for restraint on the part of political authorities. This sanctioning aspect of legal and political institutions is familiar to scholars; it has been clearly stated by Llewellyn and Hoebel, who emphasise that law, as well as providing for regulation and prevention, also deals with irregularities when they occur. "It is the case of trouble which makes, breaks, twists or flatly establishes a rule, an institution, an authority"15. These authors recognise that the distinction between what I have called categorical norms and factors of this latter type, which we may call conditional norms (since they only become effective when some categorical norm is breached), is not absolute; the two categories may shade into each other16. But it does provide a useful working basis for the classification of ethnographic data relating to the exercise of political authority, from the point of view of the restraint of its abuse. It also facilitates the formulation of some analytical problems. I tabulate below some more or less institutionalized checks on the abuse of political power, on the basis of the ethnographic material relating to the four African kingdoms mentioned above. It can be seen that these checks fall conveniently into the two categories which I have just distinguished. It is also plain that there are some institutions, such as advisory councils, which contain aspects falling into each of the two categories. Thus it is a categorical norm in many societies that rulers shall consult councils before taking decisions, and this convention, so long as it is adhered to, operates to prevent rulers from acting arbit- rarily and so abusing their power. But it is further the case in some 14 I use the term "social sanction" in a sense approximating to Radcliffe - Brown's: „a sanction is a reaction on the part of a society or of a considerable number of its members to a mode of behaviour which is thereby approved (positive sanctions) or disapproved (negative sanctions)" [Radcliffe-Brown (1952) p. 2051. 15 Llewellyn and Hoebel (1941) p. 29. 16 They add a third category, that of actual practice. This, however, appears to be rather the existential aspect of the other two than a separate category [Llewellyn and Hoebel (1949) p. 21].</page><page sequence="8">104 J- H. M.

Beattie societies that if rulers neglect to do this their councils may impose penalties on them, such as fining or deposing, thereby bringing into play conditional as well as categorical norms. This need not always happen, however. Some categorical norms are not institutionally associ- ated with any specific conditional norm, and some conditional norms have no specific reference to any particular categorical norm, but may be brought into play in consequence of a breach of any of a number of these. Even where there is an institutionalized association between norm and sanction the link may not be invariable; often one type of conditional norm may be supplemented or replaced by another. This state of affairs permits of a threefold division of institutionalized checks on the abuse of political power. Type A includes those cate- gorical norms which are not associated with specific social sanctions or conditional norms (this is not of course to say that they are unsanc- tioned). Type B comprises those social institutions which embody both categorical and conditional norms. And Type C are those conditional norms which are not institutionally linked with breaches of any parti- cular categorical norm. There are examples of all three types of check in the Table. It is important to distinguish them, for questions which may appropriately be asked in regard to one type may not be so in regard to the others. Thus the question in what categories of persons the right to apply sanctions is institutionally vested may be asked in regard to checks of Types B and C, but not of Type A. This qiuestion, and the more general problem of how far specific types of check may be associated with specific types of social structure, are briefly con- sidered in the next and final section. III. If the conditional norms listed under Type B and Type C in the Table are examined, five different categories of enforcing agents can be distinguished. First (in regard to subordinate political authorities) a superior political authority, usually the paramount, may impose a fine (Swazi), depose or degrade in rank (Ganda, Swazi, Nupe), plunder (Ganda), or repress by military force (Ganda, Nupe). Second, in three of the four societies considered - Nupe is the exception - a ruler's mother has an institutionalized right to scold or rebuke him. Third, a ruler's agnatic relatives, acting as individuals, may rebuke him (Swazi), or revolt with popular support (Swazi and Ganda); acting as a council they may, among the Swazi, reprimand him, fine him, or (in the case of a chief) appeal to the king to depose him. Fourth, unrelated sub- ordinate officials, as individuals, may remonstrate with the king (Ganda and Swazi); as a council they may reprimand him (Swazi and Ashanti), refuse to collaborate in ritual and boycott him (Nupe), appeal to a</page><page sequence="11">Checks on the Abuse of Political Power in some African States 107 higher official to depose him (Swazi), or themselves depose him (Ashanti). Fifth, subjects may appeal personally to the highest political authority (Swazi, Nupe), seek sanctuary at the royal homestead (Swazi), as an organized commoner body, repudiate an unpopular nomination for chief ship (Ashanti), refuse customary economic services (Nupe), move out of the ruler's area of jurisdiction (Ganda, Swazi and probably elsewhere), revolt (all except Nupe, and possibly there), or resort to assassination or sorcery (Swazi). An analysis of Type B and Type C checks in the Table thus provides a five-fold classification of social checks on the abuse of political power in terms of the various categories of persons who may give effect to them. No doubt these could be more precisely distinguished, and further categories could be indentified by deeper and more extensive research; also, it must be remembered that the authorities I have quoted were not, for the most part, directly concerned with questions of abuse of power and its control. But at least a preliminary classification can be proposed, even if this does no more than to systematise available data and to provide a framework for further investigation. At the next level a new series of problems emerges, concerned in particular with the correlation of the institutions just considered, together with those in Type A, with the various types of political and social organization in which they occur. Obviously no comprehensive analysis on these lines can be undertaken here, even on the basis of the limited material used, but a few comments on certain of the institutions noted, regarded in their social contexts, may indicate some areas of possible future re- search. 'First the traditional political systems of the four kingdoms I have considered must be broadly, and very briefly, sketched. The administration of the traditional Ganda kingdom is hierarchi- cally organized, territorial authority being delegated by the king to successive grades of district chiefs who are appointed by him17. The only hereditary offices are the kingship itself, one or two senior chief- ships, and the relatively unimportant clan headships18. Political author- ity is validated in the last resort by reference to the innate superiority of the ancient ruling line which was (it is supposed) founded in con- quest, and to delegation by the king. In the Swazi state, unlike Bugan- da, political organization is expressed at all levels in terms of agnatic kingship19. Political authority attaches par excellence to membership of the ruling clan of which the king is the head, and which is dispersed throughout Swazi territory. In Buganda the ruling line preserves its exclusiveness and identity against all other elements20; in Swaziland 17 Roscoe (1911) Chap. VIII, Mair (1934) p. 177. 18 Roscoe (1911) pp. 133 - 34. 10 Kuper (1947) Chaps. V and VIII. 20 Roscoe (1911) p. 81.</page><page sequence="12">108 J. H. M. Beattie it expanded territorially and genealogically so that throughout the whole country administration is closely linked with membership of the royal clan21. The chiefs as well as the king command obedience because of hereditary right and not, at least not primarily, as nominees of a central power. In Ashanti two principles are operative. All political office is based on hereditary qualification combined with popular choice, but relationships of subordination and superordination above village level do not follow a kinship pattern, deriving rather from historical and military circumstance and territorial contiguity22. In Nupe this dual basis of political organization is even more marked; at village level authority is held by the heads of localized lineages, but superimposed upon and quite distinct from this system is a centralized "feudal" structure, in which authority is ultimately sanctioned by conquest and is vested in a hereditary ruling line23. The Swazi state is the only one of the four kingdoms considered in which a lineage pattern pervades the political structure from base to apex. In Ashanti and Nupe rep- resentation at the lowest level is kinship-based, being replaced at higher levels in Ashanti by a loose political federation which tradition- ally interfered little with local autonomy, and in Nupe by a powerful and alien feudal organization. In Buganda the non-hereditary "civil service" hierarchy extends to the lowest level, where it operates in conjunction with a relatively unimportant lineage organization in which a limited degree of political authority resides. I now indicate, very summarily, a few of the more obvious lines of correlation which the Table points to, taking one or two examples of each of the three Types distinguished. I take first a Type A check; ceremonial admonition and oath-taking. This is particularly thorough- going and emphatic in Ashanti, where it is recorded of all levels of chiefs24; it is much less marked in the other kingdoms. Its emphasis in the Ashanti state may reflect the important part which the people play in the selection of their rulers; upon the councillors, as representatives of the people, devolves the task of making unambiguously clear to the chiefs what is expected of them. There seems also to be a correlation with the breadth of choice available to electors; where a man is marked down for political office from childhood, as among the Swazi, there is 21 Kuper (1947) p. 111. 22 Fortes (1948) p. 194; Rattray (1929) p. 94. 23 Nadel (1942) Chaps.

In fact admonition and oath-taking (and indeed accession ritual generally) play little part in accession to political authority in the Southern Bantu kingdom. In highly centralized "feudal" states these admonitory institutions might he expected to apply, if at all, mainly at the highest levels; for the subordinate chiefs obedience and loyalty to the sovereign rather than adherence to explicit adminis- trative norms are the prime desiderata. Among the Baganda oath- taking plays an important part in the king's accession ritual25, but it is not recorded of appointment to chief ship. This is consistent, also, with the fact that traditionally the king was chosen from a number of equally eligible princes after the death of the former king. The Nupe data are inadequate to sustain or refute any of these correlations. It is obvious, however, that there are testable hyptheses in this field. Another Type A institution listed in the Table is clientship. Where neither kinship links (as in Swazi and Ashanti) nor popular selection (as also in Ashanti) provide for political representation and protection, an alternative is attachment as a client to a powerful patron, who affords favour and protection in return for certain services and goods. As might be expected, it is reported from the typically "feudal" Nupe state26. It might also be anticipated in Buganda (it occurs in some neighbouring interlacustrine Bantu kingdoms, notably Ankole), for Ganda chiefs are neither popularly elected nor affiliated to politically significant groups of kin. Its relative unimportance here seems to be associated with the high degree of centralization and political stability of the traditional Ganda state, where the great chiefs were not merely fief-holding lords (as in Nupe), but also and pre-eminently members of a formal "civil service", responsible to the king for the good administra- tion of their areas. A third check of a categorically normative kind is embodied in systems of succession and appointment (No. 6 in the Table). The vast range of possible combinations of the principles of heredity and succession, and in the latter case the different categories of persons in whom rights of selection and of participation in accession ceremonies are vested, can- not be discussed here. But there are some obvious correspondences between the principles of appointment to office adopted in the several societies I have considered, and the structural types of these societies; indeed, the former may sometimes be said to be an essential aspect of the latter. Where political authority is vested in particular descent groups the hereditary principle will necessarily be adopted, though it may be combined with a greater or lesser degree of selection. It is 25 Roscoe (1911) p. 198; Mair (1934) p. 181. " Nadel (1942) Chap. VIII.</page><page sequence="14">110 J. H. M. Beattie obvious, also, that where, as in so-called conquest states, political authority derives more or less manifestly from a central force (which may itself be hereditary), subordinate political authority will tend to derive from this central power, and not, or not exclusively, on the basis of descent. Where both systems are combined in one state, the appoint- ment of the indigenous hereditary authorities, if they are allowed to survive at all, requires at least to be confirmed by the central power. All this is amply illustrated by the ethnographic material examined above. In Swaziland the hereditary rule prevails, virtually unqualified by any elective principle, though counterbalanced by a highly devel- oped council system27. In Ashanti, and in the ruling line of Buganda and among the nobles of Nupe, succession to political office is partly hereditary, partly determined by selection from among a number of candidates equally qualified by birth28. And in the two latter kingdoms, which are the most highly centralized politically, the territorial chiefs (Buganda) and the non-royal fief-holders (Nupe) are appointed by the central authority with little ou no regard to hereditary claim29. Of the checks in Type B, which include both categorical and condi- tional norms, I consider here only those implied in consultative and advisory relationships with agnatic relatives, and with unrelated offi- cials. The power of kinsmen to influence a ruler might be expected to vary with the degree to which political power is institutionally dis- tributed among them. Thus in Swaziland many chief ships are held by the king's agnates, and it is they who have most control over him. His relatives may advise and if necessary rebuke him, and a chief's council- lors may reprimand him, fine him, or recommend his deposition30. And a powerful brother or father's brother may, with popular support, attempt to depose a weak or oppressive king by rebellion31. This danger, met in Swaziland by giving adequate but subordinate political authority to agnates, was met in Buganda by the opposite expedient of depriving the king's brothers of all political power (at some periods of Ganda history by immolating them)32. There is no suggestion in the literature of any institutionalized advisory or supervisory relationships between the king and his agnates. Their only recourse was to revolt, and they sometimes did so. Similarly, agnatic (or matrilateral) kin appear to have had little formal influence on rulers in Nupe (or Ashanti). When we turn to the influence and importance of unrelated subordinate officials, a different principle is seen to be operative. 27 Kuper (1947) Chap. VII. 28 Busia (1951) p. 9; Roscoe (1911) p. 188; Nadel (1942) p. 94. 29 Mair (1934) p. 163; Nadel (1942) p. 98. 30 Kuper (1947) p. 67; Sčhapera (1937) p. 183. 31 Schapera (1937) p. 184. 32 Roscoe (1911) p. 189.</page><page sequence="15">Checks on the Abuse of Political Power in some African States m Where political relations throughout the system are in general con- ceived in terms of a single structural principle, whether that of agnatic kinship (Swazi) or that of the military and political federation of ever larger but internally similar units (Ashanti), the principles of rep- resentation valid at the lowest levels are still effective at the higher. Thus the Swazi family head may attend and speak at the national council, just as he may in his own local and family councils33, and the Ashanti lineage heads and the people they represent play an important part in the selection of their rulers, whether village chief, important divisional chief, or the Asantehene himself34. And they may depose the man they have selected if they think that he has ceased to represent their interests35. But where two quite different principles of political organization are uneasily juxtaposed (as in the "conquest states" of Nupe and Buganda), the ruling group's tendency to retain political power in its own hands may leave the subordinated majority with little or no constitutional means of representation. The ruling hierarchy, which may have no roots in the country, or only recent ones, and which is subject to no traditional claims from its inhabitants, admit no, or very inadequate, representation by subject groups. This is certainly the case in Nupe, where the council of state consisted mainly of fief- holding nobles resident more or less permanently at the capital36. In Buganda an intermediate position was reached; the county chiefs and their subordinates (who composed the bulk of the royal council) were not appointed by the people, but at least they lived in and were res- ponsible for the administration of their areas, and they had their own local advisers through whom the sentiments of their people were conveyed to them37. Of checks in Type C, only certain aspects of the influence of "sub- jects" on the political authorities to whom they are subordinate can be considered here; the part, that is, which what we may call popular opinion may play in political life, outside of the formal institutions so far discussed. It is useful, initially, to distinguish two ways in which popular participation in government may be formally achieved. It may be expressed, first, in the determining of what individuals are to be political authorities, as when the poeple have some say, either directly or indirectly, in the selection of rulers. And it may, secondly, be ex- pressed through the exercise of control over the ruler after he has been appointed. Though both modes of participation normally coexist they are obviously not the same, and each may occur independently. If the 33 Kuper (1947) p. 63. 34 Busia (1951) pp. 9-10. 35 Busia (1951) p. 21. 36 Nadel (1942) Chap. VII. 37 Mair (1934) p. 177.</page><page sequence="16">112 J. H. M. Beattie term "democratic" be used, as it sometimes is, only in the former sense, then consitutions like that of the Ashanti are democratic, while states like Swazi are not. But it by no means follows that the will of the poeple was less adequately represented in traditional Swaziland than it was in traditional Ashanti; Swazi tribesmen possessed, through their elaborate council system, a relatively high degree of political power. That the predominance of one type of check involves the lesser importance of the other might be a hypothesis worth investigating. For, all other things being equal, the more representative rulers are in character of the people's will, electorally expressed, the less, it might be supposed, is the need for sustained and institutionalized popular control over them when they are in office. The Swazi evidence, at least, might seem to provide inferential support for such a hypothesis. In states like Buganda and Nupe, where the central authority derives not from the matrix of the society itself but from outside it, popular opinion is less manifest, though it may express itself through ad hoc institutions like clientship or, in the last resort, by emigration or revolt. The Nupe peasant has no say in the appointment of the fief-holding lords to whom he is subject, not has his Ganda counterpart any voice in the appointment of the major chiefs. Still less can Nupe commoners or their representatives directly influence the chiefs once they are appointed, and the same is true in the traditional Ganda polity. The introduction by the British administration in recent years of "popular representatives" on chiefs' councils in Uganda was accepted without enthusiasm by the established native authorities. Even in these cen- tralized states, however, the maintenance of a certain level of prosper- ity and general security, and the acceptance of government by those subject to it, are in the interest of rulers no less than governed. Thus, for example, if a Ganda chief loses his subjects by emigration he may be dismissed by the king38, and I have noted above that subjects have other means of making their opinions felt. It is plain, also, that in a state centred on a monarch who is conceived as the primary source of all political power the head of the state may be the vehicle as well as the object of checks on misrule which derive from his subjects. A king may force his powerful chiefs to redress the wrongs of subjects who have complained to him, and by aligning himself on the side of his people he may safeguard himself against his chiefs' excessive power. Thus in case of injustice Nupe peasants, like Swazi commoners, could appeal to the king over the heads of the local rulers (though it can hardly be claimed, at least on the Nupe evidence, that much was to be hoped for from such a course)39. And public opinion is diffused through 38 Mair (1934) p. 160. 39 Nadel (1942) pp. 58, 67.</page><page sequence="17">Checks on the Abuse of Political Power in some African States 1 13 all levels of the political organization, and is not of course restricted to channels specific to it. Its two-way efficacy as a check on misrule is simply expressed in the accompanying figure. Evidently popular opinion deriving from A (the subjects) may impact either on B (the subordinate chiefs) or on C (the paramount ruler) directly, and it may also be conveyed, backed by the appropriate sanctions, to C through B or to B through C. C A &gt; B It has been possible here only to indicate a few of the themes, mostly familiar enough in other contexts, which may be suggested by an ap- proach to the study of political systems from the point of view of an analysis of checks on the abuse of power. I have not attempted any sort of exhaustive analysis of a particular political system from this point of view; that would obviously be impossible in the limits of a short article. I have suggested only that an approach to the study of political systems which is centrally concerned with the incidence and types of institutionalized checks on the abuse of political power might justify the re-examination of some already familiar ethnographic material. At the same time, and more importantly, it might make pos- sible the formulation of new hypotheses for testing intensively in new field research, and extensively in the growing mass of cross-cultural material relating to the simpler forms of political organization.

Synopsis Sicherungen gegen Mißbrauch politischer Macht in einigen afrikanischen Staaten: vorläufige Rahmengesichtspunkte für eine Analyse Im Gegensatz zu den Meinungen älterer Autoren, die für Häuptlinge oder Könige afrikanischer Staaten oft eine absolute Macht annahmen, ist es wahrscheinlich, daß auch hier Beschränkungen vorhanden sind. Um ein vorläufiges, analytisches Schema für damit zusammenhängende Erscheinun- gen aufzustellen, wurden vier typische, traditionelle afrikanische Staaten anhand der einschlägigen Literatur untersucht, und zwar die Königreiche</page><page sequence="19">Grundstrukturwandel im Differenzierungsprozeß der USA-Neger 1 1 5 Buganda, Swazi, Ashanti und Nupe. Es stellte sich dabei heraus, daß in diesen Staaten weder der König noch auch die Inhaber lokaler Machtposi- tionen eine unbeschränkte Herrschaft ausüben können bzw. konnten. Die herrschaftsbeschränkenden Normen kann man in zwei Gruppen unter- teilen. Einmal gibt es unbedingte Normen, die in das politische System als standardisierte, kategorische Handlungsweisen eingebaut sind. Zweitens gibt es bedingte Normen, d. h. solche, die bestimmte Handlungsweisen für be- stimmte Personen vorschreiben oder nahelegen, wenn eine unbedingte Norm nicht befolgt wird. Auch die bedingten Normen können voll institutionali- siert sein. Die entsprechenden Normen, die in den erwähnten Staaten je- weils gelten, sind in einer Tabelle systematisch dargestellt. Dabei wurde eine weitere Dreiteilung befolgt, und zwar: A) unbedingte Normen, die nicht von speziellen sozialen Sanktionen ge- stützt werden; B) soziale Institutionen, in denen sowohl unbedingte als auch bedingte Normen inbegriffen sind; C) bedingte Normen, die nicht spezifisch mit dem Bruch einer unbedingten Norm verbunden sind. Neben Ergebnissen dieser Art könnte die Weiterführung und Vertiefung solcher Analysen auch dazu führen, neue Arbeitshypothesen für das Stu- dium sowohl von einzelnen Kulturen als auch von Kulturvergeichen zu bilden.</page></plain_text>
