<plain_text><page sequence="1">On an Economic Limit to Ethics Rationality and the Explanation of Action Johann Fedderke When economists come to explain marriage as a contract intended to reduce search costs for sexual gratification, or analyze the decision to have children as the consumption of durable consumer goods (see for example the discussion in Becker 1981), they are faced by more than the usual charges of ahistoricism and excessive individualism from colleagues in the social sciences. They are accused of excluding that which is quintessentially human, of being incapable of understanding 'real' humans. A central concern here is that the sorts of explanations of action economists advance, in terms of the teleological account of the maximising agent, is not sensitive to important aspects of human action (see Hindess 1988). Culture, morality, the norms and commit- ments of society, it is argued, should surely enter into deliberations concerning development strategy, of how to better the lot of those affected by economic policy. The corollary to such concerns contains considerable misgivings about the central role economists play in the shaping and planning of modern society in their advisory capacity to governments. Such misgivings inevitably extend to the tendency of economics to colonise its fellow social sciences (see Harcourt 1982). Economics, it is charged, might do better if it listened more carefully to its sister disciplines, and above all developed some ethical sensibility. This paper takes such concerns seriously. Moreover, it springs out of the awareness of limitations that attach to the conceptualisations of action that are possible given the current tools of micro-economics. Economics has demonstrated the power and also the limitations of the concept of rationality based on the action-theoretic concept of the maximising agent. It does not lay claim to being the only foundation for the explanation of action, emphasises that it is at most one possible interpretation of action, and demands that it be supplemented by the perspectives provided by other disciplines. If such concerns are taken seriously, however, they can be made to extend to prominent attempts to formulate a general (by which I mean applicable to all situations, irrespective of time and space) ethics. Given the diversity of circumstance faced in policy formulation by Theoria, October 1991, pp. 63-91</page><page sequence="2">64 Theoria economists, it is a general ethics which is required. The paper begins by examining some criticisms which have been levelled at the desituatedness of the moral agent in perhaps the most prominent of modern attempts at formulating a universal ethics, John Rawls' s model of justice as fairness. The argument suggests that while it is legitimate to express discomfort at the choice situation in the Original Position, it is not the moral agent or its characteristics which constitutes the problem. Rather, it is the concept of rationality, that of the maximising agent, which is deployed by Rawls in the contracting procedure which raises doubts concerning the generality of the principles of justice. The reflexive awareness of the limitations that economics has of its most fundamental action-theoretic concept, suggests the legitimacy of doubts concerning the generality of any principles of justice founded on it. It is this potential limitation that is the concern of this paper. The examination continues with a discussion of a possible vindication of the generality of justice as fairness, despite the apparent particularism of the concept of rationality which underlies it. Failure of this vindication leads on to the examination of a generalised concept of rationality, formulated by Habermas, which in turn has formed the basis of a general ethics. Unfortunately I must conclude on a sceptical note. The Haber- masian concept of rationality also appears to contain within it the teleological moment on which the fundamental economic action- theoretic concept rests. This is a surprising result, given that Habermas is explicitly concerned to formulate a concept of action which is capable of embracing all the more particular conceptions of agency provided by the various social sciences. This leads to a conclusion which can do no more than raise a number of questions. Is it correct to say that the teleological conception of agency, with which economists work, is too particularistic - given that the teleological moment reappears even in systematic attempts to avoid it in the formulation of an alternative standard of rationality? Both Rawls and Habermas, seem, in the final instance, unable to escape from it. Given the tenacity of its appearance, is the problem not perhaps the charge of particularism that is levelled against it? Perhaps it has a degree of generality, a generality which might vindicate the economic approach to policy formulation? How would an answer to such questions look, and are they meaningful in the first instance? The second question that is raised is whether the implicit assumption that underlies the body of argument within the paper, viz that a general ethics requires to be underpinned by a general concept of rationality, is vindicated. Can an account of ethics not be general, despite a particularistic concept of</page><page sequence="3">An Economic Limit to Ethics 65 rationality at its foundation, if the concept of rationality should prove so limited? Is this only sometimes permissible, under certain circumstances, always, or never? It is as a plea to an answer to these questions, that the paper is best understood. Objections to Rawls's Theory of Justice Rawls' s model of justice as fairness promises principles of justice which satisfy the requirements of economic policy formulation. Justice as fairness is a search for principles of practical reason to serve as a touchstone for all actions, irrespective of time or place, promising a complexity-reducing mechanism of the highest order. Yet Rawls's Theory of Justice has come under sustained attack for the desituatedness of its moral agents. Such desituatedness, it is argued, makes it impossible for the moral agents to have a proper moral sensibility, and makes the generality that Rawls claims for his principles of justice either meaningless, or, worse, pernicious, since it does not show sufficient sensitivity to the particularities of situated- ness. Three such problem-types centre on the knowledge conditions of the Original Position, the basis of the justification of the principles of justice, and the thin theory of the good. The knowledge conditions in the Original Position There are two distinct, though related, types of objections to the knowledge conditions characterising the Original Position that I wish to address here. Both question the possibility of formulating the type of knowledge claims that Rawls deems necessary for the Original Position to fulfil its purpose. These doubts translate into serious misgivings about whether the principles of justice produced in the Original Position, behind the Veil of Ignorance, are applicable to humans situated in social and historical reality. The first line of argument questions the possibility of formulating general knowledge of social phenomena (see Barber 1975, Wolff 1977:120-32). Theories of social phenomena and processes are argued to be distinct from those of the natural sciences in terms of their generality and certainty. Historical and spatial contingency lie at the core of social phenomena and their development, emptying any abstraction from these contingencies of meaning or explanatory power. Or, such 'general' knowledge claims as are formulable, provide a profoundly ahistorical view of political, economic and social knowledge, of society as an object governed by immutable laws not subject to change. Such a framework is argued to be of little use in</page><page sequence="4">66 Theoria the interpretation of historical and spatial contingencies, of the dynamic characteristics of real existence. The general knowledge that Rawls wishes to rely on to formulate his principles of justice is thus not available, or not meaningful to the formulation of such principles. The second line of criticism stresses the linkedness of Agency and Structure in social phenomena and processes. Society, it is argued, does not have an independent existence from the knowledge of individuals about that society (see Habermas 1983:76, Wolff 1977: 120-32). The personality of agents is developed as an internalisation of a conception of social reality, and sustained and altered through its expression in social interaction. Structure and Agency are thus not separable, but interdependent, and one cannot be understood, indeed actualised, without the other. The implications for our purposes are twofold. First, knowledge of society and societal processes is inherently historical. Moral agents in the Original Position, behind the Veil of Ignorance, must thus always know which society they are concerned with in their contracting if they are to know anything at all about that society. Second, since knowledge of society is self- or identity-constituting, the moral agent must, by virtue of that knowledge, garner further information about his/her own personal traits. The contracting procedure in the Original Position is thus irreducibly tied to a consideration of particular information about the contracting moral agents. The distinction of general as opposed to particular information concerning the agents appears to lose its meaning. The reasoning for the principles of justice Perhaps the major controversy engendered by the argument for the principles of justice, surrounds the use of the maximin principle to justify the difference principle. Rawls himself specifies the conditions under which the maximin principle is appropriate: where probabilities of final outcomes are not available, where the decision-makers care little about attaining more than the pay-off entailed by the maximin solution, or where unfavourable outcomes entail great risks. Any of these conditions are sufficient though not necessary for the use of maximin (see Rawls 1971:26). I wish to concentrate on Wolffs (1977:ch. 14, ch. 15) arguments against the last two of these, since the absence of probabilistic knowledge is difficult to maintain given the retort to these objections below. Wolffs arguments against the latter two justifications of maximin point in a common direction. First, the suggestion that agents in the Original Position care only for a minimum of primary goods is contingent on a kinked utility function. Second, the riskiness</page><page sequence="5">An Economic Limit to Ethics 67 of unfavourable outcomes to the contracting process will entail the maximin solution only if the agents are risk-averse. Both of these characteristics are empirically contingent. Since justice as fairness is explicitly intended to abstract from contingent characteristics of the contracting agents, both these justifications for the maximin principle, therefore, appear to violate a fundamental requiremeni of Rawls' s theory. The thin theory of the good The criticism I wish to concentrate on here is the charge that the concept of rationality employed by Rawls is the rationality typical of the firm, time-less and unchanging. Instead, it is suggested, for individuals rationality changes its nature over the life-cycle of the individual (see Wolff 1977:ch. 14). The concept of rationality Rawls embraces is that most often found in economics, and which lies at the heart of rational choice theory. Rational action is that action which maximises the returns (both pecuniary and non-pecuniary) from the activity of the agent (see Rawls 1971:§25, §64). Wolff finds such a view of rationality unacceptable. In particular, he argues that such rationality cannot be considered typical of individuals, or persons, but is the rationality associated with firms. Moreover, it presumes the preferences of persons to be static and unchanging, a suggestion he finds untenable. A retort It is useful to bear in mind the object of the Original Position and the Veil of Ignorance: the prevention of contingent characteristics of the contracting moral agents from coming to hold moral force (see Rawls 197 1 :§3, §13). The point is best understood in a functional sense, since the Original Position with its associated Veil of Ignorance is after all only a thought experiment, intended to highlight those considerations which are, and those which are not, considered to be morally relevant. The contracting procedure could be viewed as one which proceeds on two distinct levels. The first, or cognitive level, is concerned with the identification of the distinguishing characteristics of social forms, their Structure- Agency symbiosis, and the workings of the societies in question. This level would include the unique and distinguishing features of all the relevant categories of agents in that society necessary to understand the functioning, and relative placement of all classes of agents within that society.1</page><page sequence="6">68 Theoria The second level is a moral one. In the latter, while a full understanding of the cognitive level is presupposed, not all of the information contained within it is morally apposite. In particular the contingent features attaching to the contracting agents need to be precluded (even if such information was necessary on the cognitive level), in order to prevent specific interests from shaping the principles of justice agreed on. Choosing principles of justice, must be undertaken from a position which leaves aside the contingent characteristics of the self. But such choice would be made after understanding had been developed at the cognitive level of how contingencies come to influence or shape the position of agents in society. The real question, then, is not the nature of the knowledge conditions in the Original Position, since these are palpably artificial and unrealistic, intended merely to conduct the reader through a thought experiment designed to rank knowledge according to its moral relevance. The real question is whether contingent character- istics of the moral agents are morally relevant. For Rawls the answer to this question is clearly negative, on the basis of a series of considerations. Rawls' s starting point in the Theory of Justice is the existence of objective and subjective circumstances of justice (Rawls 1 97 1 :§22). It is the material and psychic benefits which flow from cooperation between individuals in social structures, and the pervasiveness of scarcity, that make the principles of justice necessary in order to distribute the benefits (see De Kadt 1989, and De Kadt 1990 for further discussion of the relationship between justice and scarcity). Given the finiteness of human capacity, not all information can be taken into account when deciding on the right distribution. The question thus is which information should be ignored, and which counted as relevant. For Rawls, in moral contexts it is information which relates to the contingent characteristics of the moral agents which should be ignored. His justification is as follows. First, on a purely formal note, if the moral agents are forced to ignore their contingent characteristics in formulating the general principles of distributive justice, the principles decided on should be stable (see Rawls 197 1 :§20, §29). Since each contracting moral agent cannot allow his or her contingent characteristics to influence his/her choice of principles of justice, each moral agent should arrive at the same principles of justice. Once the contract is also public, and known to be such, the principles agreed upon are robust against ex post revision. The outcome of the contracting process is unaffected by the number of contractors.2 This has the advantage that the social contract becomes one of personal commitment given the circumstances of</page><page sequence="7">An Economic Limit to Ethics 69 justice, and safeguards the continued existence of that which gave rise to the circumstances of justice, viz the cooperation between moral agents raising the need for distributive principles. Further, the exclusion of contingent characteristics is justified on the grounds that it ensures impartiality (Rawls 197 1 :§ 190, §30), a priority of right over good (Rawls 1971: §4), that contracting parties are ensured to be equals (Rawls 197 1 :§4), that it provides a means to obtain principles which are a final court of appeal to override law, custom and social rules, prudence and self-interest should this be necessary (see Rawls 197 1 :§23; this might be appropriate where law, custom, and social rules take the form of apartheid, for instance). In short, it is a means of ensuring generality and universality for the principles of justice (Rawls 1971 :§23). Yet while this is the formal argument presented by Rawls, it is not conclusive. It is not clear that the exclusion of contingent character- istics is the only means by which the above considerations could be satisfied. And hence, it does not follow that the argument is sufficient to demonstrate the necessity of excluding contingent features of moral agents. I wish to suggest that the real motivation for the exclusion of contingent characteristics is perhaps not to be found in Part One of the Theory of Justice, but rather in Part Three. In Part Three the argument rests on the primacy of human worth and the sense of worth, without which moral agents cannot hope to achieve a sense of self and of dignity (see for example Rawls 197 1 :§50, §68). It is to the establishment of this fundamental worth of the moral agent, qua moral agent, that the argument for equality as a primary value in §77 of the Theory of Justice is aimed. The primacy of equality as a value is justified on the basis of the moral subject's capacity for a conception of (its own) good and of a sense of justice (see Rawls 1971:19, 509, §77). But perhaps most importantly, it is the recogni- tion and positive acceptance of the irreducible plurality of identity of moral subjects, the integrity of such an identity, and the inherent ability of moral subjects to realise a sense of dignity, to self-actualise no matter what contingent form their identity may have, which deserves recognition and protection in any concept of justice (see Rawls 1971:28, 127). Such plurality can only be protected by giving each contracting party in the contract a position of equal influence on the final principles of justice chosen, and barring the possibility of strategic behaviour (see Rawls 1971:12, 120, §87). It is only when the equality of contracting agents is guaranteed, that it is certain that the agents will be in a position to choose their ends themselves. Only the possibility of being able to choose their ends themselves, of being able to construct their identity, to express it in their pursuit of</page><page sequence="8">70 Theoria their conception of the good, is the basis for the realisation of worth of moral agents. Without the recognition of the foundational importance of the possibility of realising self-respect by accepting that each agent is of absolute value, the pursuance of good has little meaning. The sense of worth of agents is only possible if the agents are able to choose and form their sense of the good. In short, the moral irrelevance (in the sense defined) of contingent characteristics of agents, entails a priority of self over ends, emphasises that what is important is not that agents have, but that they choose ends. For Rawls, given the circumstances of justice, and the plurality of human existence, the impetus to moral agency is a constitutive element of the identity of the contracting agents. For both objections to the knowledge conditions of the Original Position combined with the Veil of Ignorance, the retort can be the same. It may be true that knowledge of social phenomena may not have the degree of generality that principles of natural science may assume, and the relationship between Agency and Structure may indeed be symbiotic. But this may be reflected in the knowledge of the Original Position, as long as the particular contingent features of the contracting agents are prohibited from carrying weight in the deliberations leading to the choice of the principles of justice. The real question, I have argued, is not the epistemological plausibility of the contracting agents, but whether one accepts the argument for the irrelevance of contingent characteristics for moral claims, or not. This clarifies why Wolffs argument that the reasoning for the maximin principle as the decision criterion for the principles of justice carries more weight. For the point of the argument is that the justification of the maximin principle introduces just the contingency that Rawls must avoid if the objections to the knowledge conditions of the Original Position are to be averted. Not only is the nature of the choice situation under attack at this point, but the very principles which led Rawls to the specification of the controversial choice situation appear to have been violated. Yet here too the objection fails. For Rawls, given the circumstances of justice and the plurality of human existence, the impetus to moral agency is a constitutive element of the identity of the contracting agents. Such identity can only be realised if the fundamental worth of the moral agent, the dignity of the person, and the possibility of self-actualization are recognised and safeguarded. A minimum, threshold level of primary goods is necessary to ensure the realisation of such identity. Persons would not be persons, would not be moral agents if the possibility of self-actualisation, of a self-realisation of dignity were not possible, and it is this purpose that the primary goods serve. Wolffs objection begs the real question. As long as the</page><page sequence="9">An Economic Limit to Ethics 71 necessary enabling condition of human identity is located outside of all contingent characteristics, any conceptualisation of the good, i.e. the nature of agents' objective functions over which they maximise, and their attitude toward risk is simply immaterial. It is on the identity of the moral agents that the objective functions and risk-attitudes are founded, and the minimum quantity of primary goods are designed as enabling conditions for the formation of such an identity. And more fundamentally, since the identity of the agents is foundational to the rest of the possible experiences of agents, and is prior to the possibilities that the agent may experience, it is beyond considerations of risk-management. The argument against the thin theory of the good takes a step toward circumventing this retort. By challenging the rationality which underpins the choice of agents in the Original Position, the nature of Rawls' s conception of agents' identities is questioned. The concept of rationality is argued to apply to firm behaviour, rather than to agents, and to be far too static to be of use in analysing the activity of agents. This is not entirely correct, however. The concept of rationality as maximisation is employed by rational choice theory and micro- economics, for both individuals and firms.3 What differs between the two classes of agents is not the concept of rationality, but the preference structure. Whereas firms are held to have fairly uni- dimensional objectives, the maximisation of profit, individuals have considerably more differentiated goals.4 What might be more appropriate to argue, is that whereas the preferences of firms are relatively stable,5 those of individuals are not. As an individual ages, the nature of the preferences of that individual may come to change. But this is a different matter altogether from challenging the concept of rationality. It is not the concept of rationality, viz. the maximisation principle, but rather the preferences, the objective function across which the individuals are maximising, which is subject to change. Such changes to the objective function are recognised, if contested,6 by the rational choice literature, and to some extent dealt with by the terms of rational choice theory itself (see Ackerlof 1991, and Elster 1979, 1985). That preferences are not stable over time, or may be inconsistent, does not question the concept of rationality used by rational choice theory. It may point to some paradoxes which follow from its use in certain circumstances, but maximisation remains intact as the reference-point of the analysis. Now it is not clear that such paradoxes are entailed by the Original Positioii. What is more, there is no contrast between the concept of rationality in use for the analysis of firm behaviour, and individual action. Nor is</page><page sequence="10">72 Theoria the contrast with regard to the stability of the preferences underlying the concept of rationality between firms and individuals as great as Wolff argues. The concept of rationality is not implausible on the grounds that Wolff advances. It may be maintained, even in the face of multiple selves. Interestingly, the instability of the preference structures of moral agents could be argued to strengthen the basis on which Rawls wishes to exclude contingent characteristics of agents from carrying moral force. If agents know that plurality is a feature not only between but also within agents over time, the importance of allowing such difference to be reflected in the choices of agents becomes reinforced. Again, primary goods are simply the necessary, though not sufficient prerequisites for the fulfilment of any life-plan, in full recognition of the diversity that life-plans may come to evince. In short, the recognition of the existence of multiple selves is the motivation for the introduction of the Original Position-Veil of Ignorance combination. A remaining concern about justice as fairness All of the above criticisms are focused on the choice situation in the Original Position. All of the criticisms moreover, centre on the moral subject and its characteristics in the Original Position. It is the knowledge claims of moral agents (ahistorical and incapable of reflecting the symbiosis between Structure and Agency), the nature of their utility functions (kinked or changing over time, creating the problem of multiple selves), and their attitudes toward risk which are at issue.7 But there is another direction in which discomfort with the choice situation can be taken. Wolff comes closest to articulating such discomfort, by raising the question of the rationality-type that is used to conceptualise the Original Position, the rationality of homo oeconomicus , ofthe maximising agent (see Rawls 1971 :§8, §25, §64). The maximin principle was after all developed in Rational Choice Theory. From economics we know the power of this tool of analysis. It is capable of accommodating constraints on the information at the disposal of the agents. Risk,8 and more tenuously uncertainty,9 are both being modelled. Implications of various informational ineffi- ciencies are explored in the newer institutional literature (see Hodgson 1988 for an overview) while constraints on information- processing abilities of agents are also capable of being accommodated (see Heiner 1983) within the framework of the maximising agent. Applications of the concept of the maximising agent have burgeoned, from the obvious economic contexts, to preserves formally consi- dered sociological (see Becker 1976c), that of political theory (see</page><page sequence="11">An Economic Limit to Ethics 73 Hahn 1990 and Becker 1976b), history and anthropology (see Smith 1975) and psychology (see Ackerlof 1991 and Becker 1976a). The concept of the maximising agent has considerable explanatory power, and has proved robust against criticism of its purported lack of realism. It has continued to provide the core of a research programme which has been able to accommodate the concerns of critics, in part by the increased mathematisation of the discipline of economics. However, most sophisticated proponents of the use of the concept of the maximising agent do not claim for it the status of the sole explanatory tool of action at our disposal (see for instance the comments to this effect in Hahn 1990). In the light of advances in psychology, in political theory and sociology, such claims would be palpably absurd. All that is claimed is that it is a powerful tool amongst others, that it provides us with an important insight into action and interaction of agents. I wish to pursue this further with regard to Rawls' s justice as fairness. For Rawls uses the concept of rationality based on the maximising agent to the exclusion of all else (see Rawls 197 1 :§25, §64). 10 Economists realise that their action-theoretic concept of rationality is but one possible basis for the interpretation of the activity of agents, and that there are other possible conceptions of action - normative, expressive, dramaturgical, communicative - besides the teleological concept dealt with in economics. The question that this raises for the Rawlsian theory is whether the principles of justice, if based on a partial conception of rationality, can hope to capture and provide guidelines to the full complexity of human practical activity, even if it is concerned only with the issue of the distribution of the benefits of such activity. Can we trust it to regulate adequately actions which have a structure different from that entailed by rational choice theory? Should our moral principles not be based on a more differentiated concept of rationality? It is these concerns after all, which drive the misgivings of social scientists about economic explanations of action, with which this paper began. The core concern is that there may be action-types, or aspects of action which the concept of the maximising agent is not able to differentiate, engendering doubts about the action-theoretic foundation of Rawls' s principles of justice. Should these concerns be meaningful, I wish to argue that their resolution rests on the nature of the relationship between reasons for action, and actions. For it is in the differentiation of this relation set that differences between action types come to be captured.</page><page sequence="12">74 Theoria Rawls' s reliance on the economic concept of rationality would be vindicated if it were possible to show that the relationship between reasons for action and actions were causal. The causal conception of the relation set between reasons and actions suggests the existence of necessary and sufficient conditionship relations between reasons and actions, which are the basis of any explanation of an action. The concept of causality deployed here is that argued for by Von Wright (1971), viz that causality can be expressed in terms of necessary and sufficient conditionship relations between the expla- nantia and explanandum , which respectively lead to 'How-possible?' and 'Why-necessary?' type of explanations of the explanandum . Some further requirements for causal explanation are that the explanantia and explanandum are logically independent, and that the phenomena related by the causal explanation be 'generic' (that is, may obtain or not obtain on given occasions, and may obtain or not obtain, repeatedly) (see Von Wright 1971 and Hempel 1966). Important in this regard is that the affirmation of causal explana- tions of action does not entail that teleological explanations, explana- tions in terms of means-end chains, are meaningless. While some theorists of explanation wish to assert that teleological explanation is distinct from causal explanation and legitimate in its own right (see the discussion in Von Wright 1 97 1 , ch. 3 for instance), a considerable school of thought argues for the inherent reducibility of teleological to causal explanation (see Wright 1976 for an overview, and Woodfield 1976 for further discussion). According to the latter view, teleological explanations are simply causal explanations in another guise, or expressed in convenient short-hand. If it is correct to say that the relationship between reasons and actions is always causal, there is a respectable credential for any concept of rationality which carries at its core a conception of agency which is teleological. It would simply be a short-hand reflection of the causal foundation to action, and would thus have the generality we require of it. It would, after all, be appropriate in the explanation and moral evaluation of all action. The rational choice framework favoured by Rawls would be vindicated, and the doubts concern- ing the generality of the Rawlsian principles of justice dispelled. This conclusion follows only if it is correct to say that actions do indeed stand in a causal relation to the reasons for the action, that this is a necessary feature of agency. Precisely such a claim is forwarded by proponents of the causal conception of reason-action relation sets. For Davidson, for example, any rationalisation (by which he means explanation) of an action must posit a link between a primary reason</page><page sequence="13">An Economic Limit to Ethics 75 and the action, where a primary reason is the conjunction of a pro-attitude toward actions of a certain type, and a belief that a particular action is of that type. Such a primary reason is held to be a cause of the action (all of Davidson's work on action argues, or is based on this point, but see for example, Davidson 1980a:4, 1980a:9, 1980b:31, 1980d:73, 1980d:76, 1980e:83-4). For any explanation of action, such a primary reason would be sufficient to rationalise the action (This is symptomatic of the early Davidson - particularly Davidson 1988a. As will become obvious from the discussion below, Davidson's views progressed over time, in response to various problems which are apparent in the causal conception of the reason-action relation set. As a consequence, the claim to sufficiency is relinquished to be replaced by a claim to necessity.) But this view is problematic. Consider the case of Oedipus and Jocasta. Oedipus was of the opinion that his marrying Jocasta was an expression of deep, sincere love and appreciation of Jocasta' s qualities, that his being drawn to her was a demonstration of the respect in which he held Jocasta. If asked on his wedding day, what the reasons for his action were, he might have stated a primary reason to this effect, couched in terms of a statement of intent. Thanks to Freud, however, we know now that the real reason for Oedipus' marrying Jocasta was the desire to possess his mother. All talk of true love and respect is but a cover for deep inner drives in Oedipus.11 How are we to understand this phenomenon in terms of the causal account of action? We have an instance of an action in which the agent is convinced of his reasons for action. He would have fought for his honour if anybody had slighted his motives, and, after all, his response to the discovery of the true state of affairs was quite drastic. And yet - they were not what moved Oedipus to marry Jocasta. He really wanted to possess his mother. What he intended to do was one thing, what caused the action was quite another reason. Such examples obscure the causal conception of action. The why and the how of the conditionship relations between reasons and intentions, reasons and action, and the intention and the action are obscured. Why and how is it that the conscious primary reason which the agent believed to have causal efficacy, did not come to have such efficacy, and the unconscious desire to possess his mother was the pro-attitude which was truly causally efficacious? What is more, what role does intention have to play in such a conception of action any longer? The intention of Oedipus seems to bear no relation to the performed action whatever, and this despite the fact that action is generally conceived of as intentional doing, such that definitionally intention is central to that which is an action (see Von Wright 1971, Davidson 1980a, Williams 1979).</page><page sequence="14">76 Theoria Davidson has a potential response. Prior to any action the agent holds a plurality of reasons, and the causal conception of action must account for how some primary reasons come to dominate others, to hold causal efficacy, while others do not. His answer argues that action is the conclusion to a practical syllogism (see Davidson 1980a: 15-6, 1980e:84, 1980e:98-9). This has the appealing corollary that we can argue that the Oedipus/Jocasta problem is not very serious after all. It is often the case that we are mistaken about causal claims, and that we are convinced of our errors through reasoned argument. I might think that the loud bang outside the door of my office is caused by a slamming door. In fact, it is caused by the bursting of a balloon. This is something that I may be convinced of, given satisfactory evidence. So, we might say, Oedipus was merely mistaken about his reasons for marrying Jocasta, and reasoned argument managed to convince him of the true reason. The primary reason for the action is thus no longer a sufficient condition for action, does not suffice to explain the action, but is at best a necessary condition providing the basis for a 'How-possible?' type of explanation. Full explanation requires the practical syllogism. This in itself does not challenge causal explanation, but nor does it truly address the Oedipal puzzle. Oedipus could be said to have held the causally inefficacious primary reasons on the basis of a practical syllogism. That he loved and respected Jocasta, and wished to express his love for her in marriage could have been presented in an appropriate practical syllogism before psychoanalysis. And neverthe- less, it is not this, but quite another reason which comes to hold causal efficacy, overriding the practical syllogism offered initially. The puzzle is that it is not the practical syllogism that Oedipus consciously derived, but one which he did not which came to hold causal efficacy. But there is a further problem with the practical syllogism response to the Oedipus dilemma. The relation between reasons and actions is not of the same order as the relations between states of affairs and events in the natural world. My knowledge and experience of the primary reasons that I associate with my actions is of far greater intimacy than my knowledge of the popping balloon before my office door. The evidence which convinces Oedipus that his real reason for his marrying Jocasta is couched not in terms of external events, but in introspection. Oedipus becomes convinced only since he experiences the desire to possess his mother with the same, perhaps greater, degree of intimacy or immediacy as his earlier primary reason for marrying Jocasta. It has to be a practical syllogism that the agent him/herself has to be capable of embracing, which comes to supersede any earlier reasoning for action, and this merely leads us to an infinite regress.</page><page sequence="15">An Economic Limit to Ethics 77 For Oedipus was already once before at the concluding point of a practical syllogism, and that turned out to be wrong, and, in fact, not causally efficacious. How are we ever to tell which is the true cause? We think that reasons cause given actions, but so did Oedipus, and his conviction did not serve. Obscurity is still very much a feature of the causal account of action, and certainly it appears as if the conjunction of primary reason and practical syllogism is not yet the specification of sufficient conditions for action. We need to establish why it is that some practical syllogisms come to carry causal efficacy, and others do not, and how we go about establishing this. Are we to fall back on merely necessary conditions for action, and 'How-possible?' rather than 'Why-necessary?' types of explana- tions? Even this line of defence is blocked, and by Davidson's own admission. Davidson addresses the problem of akrasia (see Davidson 1980b), to provide an account of weakness of the will in terms of the causal conception of the reasons-action relation set. The problem is related to the puzzle I formulated with regard to Oedipus. Here the question is how it is possible for reasons which conclusively and genuinely are considered to be weaker than others which the agent holds, nevertheless come to hold causal efficacy. The final answer for Davidson is an admission that for actions that are an expression of the weakness of the will, there are, in the final instance, no reasons. This is startling. We have a practical syllogism which definitively backs one (the stronger) primary reason. Yet the practical syllogism backs the primary reason which turns out not to be causally efficacious. Davidson has to say that here we have an action for which for which we have to say that there is no reason , no cause. It is no longer clear what causality means in connection with action at all. If primary reason and practical syllogism were to be necessary conditions for action, which is the sense one could salvage for the causal account of action from the argument above, then here we have an action for which primary reasons and practical syllogism osten- sibly do not play any role whatsoever. In this instance at least, the primary reason-practical syllogism conjunction does not constitute a necessary condition for the action, and how then are we to know that it does so in other cases? What remains for Davidson is an admission that what is meant by 'agent causality' is not what is meant by causality generally (see Davidson 1980c). Under such circumstances it is not clear why the term should be used at all, and what it does signify. But I am not satisfied as yet. There is for me another set of difficulties of material importance that attach to the causal conception of the reason-action relation set. The practical syllogism is a</page><page sequence="16">78 Theoria formalised expression of what we might more mundanely call 'deliberation' a term that Williams prefers in this regard (see Williams 1979). Clearly deliberation is a complex term, which I do not profess to have the expertise to unpack. Yet it does not seem odd to class the formulation of practical syllogisms as deliberation, nor does it seem odd to talk of deliberation as a (mental) action. The difficulty for the causal conception of the reason-action relation set here is that the explanation of the logical structure of action is in terms of yet another action. We have not entered into the structure of action at all, but have merely pointed to another, earlier action. There is a circularity at this point, a doubt about the logical coherence of the causal account of action. To take the query further. If the practical syllogism does indeed fulfil the function Davidson envisages, and it is itself simply another action, why is it that this type of action is given veto-powers over others? After all, we have other decision-making actions, flippings of coins, listening to ancestral voices in the dark of the night, chanting rhymes to choose between alternatives, plucking daisy petals, and so on. What is it that gives practical syllogisms precedence, for the causal conception of action, over other actions which fulfil the same function? Lastly, if deliberation is itself an action, it too must presumably be related to a primary reason if the causal account of action is to be consistent (unless of course we wish to claim that this action type does not have to fulfil this condition; but why this should be the case, needs justification). Now if the agent concerned does not have a pro-attitude to deliberation, according to the causal conception of action the agent does not, and cannot have a reason to deliberate (nor is it clear how it could be established that though the agent does not he/she ought to have the appropriate pro-attitude). I wish to rest the case against the causal conception of action at this point. While the dismissal of the arguments of a single philosopher cannot serve to establish that a coherent exposition of a causal conception of action-reason relation sets will not be articulated (though I suspect that it will not, since arguments in principle against the causal conception exist), we do not to my knowledge have such an account at present. This closes the door on the defence of a teleological conception of agency and Rawls' s concept of rationality. It places the question as to whether Rawls' s justice as fairness is truly differentiated enough to capture the filli breadth of human experience on the agenda once again. The generality of the Rawlsian project remains in doubt.</page><page sequence="17">Ari Economic Limit to Ethics 79 An alternative general concept of rationality The argument above has been that the causal account of action is not available to defend the Rawlsian concept of rationality. But is there no hope that a general ethical theory is attainable, perhaps on other grounds? I wish to explore this possibility on the basis of the link between reason and action. I argued above that the causal conception of the link between reason and action is not tenable.12 Yet the causal account seems initially plausible precisely because we are aware of the intimacy of the link between reasons and action. The dismissal of the causal account of action does not question this intimacy, indeed sharpens the question of what the nature of the link is. The answer I wish to suggest, is to conceive of the link between action and reason not in ontological terms, but linguistically. Reasons are not ontological, but linguistic, propositional entities. As such they can provide grounds , not causes for actions (since causes are frequently conceived of as having ontological status). The link between reasons and actions is conceptual and logical, while that between cause and effect is factual and empirical. The argument for this position is simply that actions are not logically independent of their reasons, that an action is only individuated with respect to the intention with which it was performed. To be able to tell what an action is, we have to know the intention with which it was performed. I wish to advance three sets of considerations in support of this contention. Consider the drinking of a glass of water by an agent. Drinking a glass of water is a doing which has specific physical features, viz that the agent raise a glass filled with clear fluid of a certain density, mass and viscosity to the lips, to tilt the glass in order to allow the fluid to enter the mouth cavity, that swallowing motions convey the fluid into the stomach of the agent. While this description may be inadequate, it (or some description like it) is one speakers of English would recognise as the drinking of a glass of water. Such drinkings of glasses of water are performed identically (in some sense) by millions of agents daily. It is correct to say that such performances may be indistinguishable from one another. And yet there is a crucial difference between the drinking of a glass of water performed with the intention 'to quench thirst', and a drinking performed with the intention 'to take part in a welcoming ceremony'. The two drinkings are not the same action despite their physical similitude. Adding luridness to the example may make the point somewhat clearer. Agent A's butchering of B out of pure sadistic pleasure, is not</page><page sequence="18">80 Theoria the same thing as A's butchering of B out of self-defence. The two actions may be physically identical, but it is strange to say that they are the same (type of) action. We distinguish sufficiently between them, so that we would wish to treat A quite differently under the two circumstances. More tellingly, we might hesitate to call the act of self-defence a 'butchering'. The individuation of actions seems to be intimately connected to the intentions with which they are per- formed. Of course, many actions we readily or easily identify for what they are, because they are caught in a tightly circumscribed set of rules, they are routine, familiar, we have discussed them at length with the agent, and so on. Yet if I am followed doggedly by a man in a Trilby hat, with a calabash pipe and a large magnifying glass, I wish to know what it is that he is doing. And the what is answered not by a description of slinking, and the nature of his attire, but by his intentions in his behaviour. Part of what it is that an agent is doing can only be captured by reference to the intention with which it was performed. A similar point becomes clear when we consider the means by which we distinguish genuine, from deliberate mistakes (the examples are taken from Davidson 1980b:45). The intentional misreading of a text, misinterpretation of an order, underestimation of a weight, miscalculation of a sum individuates from the unintentional mistake only on the basis of the intention out of which the action was performed. The genuine mistake flows from an action which intends a correct reading etc, and where the slip is inadvertent. The intentional mistake intends the slip, such that the incorrect performance is in fact a correct performance relative to the intention of the agent. Again, the intentional and inadvertent mistakes are quite distinct actions, but the distinction is possible only with respect to the intention with which they were performed. Lastly, any action has potentially infinite physical descriptions. Davidson's (1980d) flipping of a light switch, is also the turning on of the light, illumination of the room, alerting of the prowler outside the window, disturbing the bird roosting in the tree before the window, providing a beacon to the traveller through the darkness of the night, as well as the movement of air molecules, activation of electron flows, electromagnetic waves, and so on. It is absurd to say that the agent 'did' all of these, that they were all a part of the action of the agent. While Davidson on his causal account is forced to accept that only the hand-movement, the actual flipping of the switch, is a 'true' action, I suggest that the action is individuated by the intention that the agent holds in flipping the switch. The intention contains conditions of satisfaction which specify what must follow from the doing of the</page><page sequence="19">An Economic Limit to Ethics 81 agent, in order for the intended action to have been fulfilled (this specification owes much to Searle 1983). Thus the agent could have intended the illumination of the room, and it is correct to say that the agent's act was one of illuminating the room. However, since he did not intend to disturb the bird before the window, the disturbance was not part of the action (as defined by the conditions of satisfaction of the intention of the agent in flipping the switch), though it was a consequence of the action. To distinguish actions from the potentially infinite consequences of an intervention in the world, requires reference to the intention with which the action was performed. That the room was illuminated as a result of the flipping of the switch, is distinguished from the movement of air molecules and the alerting of the prowler, by the fact the illumination was intended, and the other results of the doing of the agent were not. It is the intention which provides the means by which consequences which do belong to the action, and those that do not are distinguished. Intention in the doing of the agent allows us to provide descriptions of the action, as opposed to descriptions of bodily movements and their consequences. The doing of the agent comes to be an action, to be distinct from a mere (reflex) doing of an agent, only when linked in a relation set to a reason (which I have here taken to be identical to an intention) for the action. And the link is a conceptual one. The action is defined as a slaking of thirst, with reference to the intention with which it was performed. Any substantive action comes to stand in a conceptual link with a substantive intention. Reasons thus stand in a conceptual link to action. They impart meaning to the doings of agents. The drinking of a glass of water carries distinct meanings if performed with the intention to slake thirst, or in order to give the appropriate signals in a welcoming function. Or the meaning of Oedipus' marriage to Jocasta is not independent of whether he intended to express his sincere love, or wished to possess his mother. The two acts are not the same, carry differentiated meaning, although they could both conceivably be embodied in the same spatio-temporal doing. Two possible responses to this argument must be considered before we can continue. First, one might argue that intentions are important in identifying what an action is, but that this only means that we have identified its cause. But there are two difficulties with this response. Causal explanation requires logical independence of ex planantia and explanandum , and this is contested by the conceptual link between intention and action. If the link between reason and action is analytic, it destroys the prospect of using reasons in causal explanations, and destroys it in principle. Further, the suggestion that the intention in an</page><page sequence="20">82 Theoria action tells us what it is that the agent is doing, clearly places doings of agents on a different plane from events to be grasped by event- causality. The movement of ball A across the billiard table may have a myriad of causes. It may have been struck by ball B, I may have pushed it, the table may have been slanted, or bumped, there may have been an earth tremor. But what it is that ball A is 'doing', is quite distinct from any of these causes, and can be accurately described independently of its cause. With actions by contrast, part of what it is that agents are doing, depends on their intentions. Intentions are conceptually bound to actions. Second, both Davidson ( 1 980b: 1 4) and Bhaskar ( 1 979:ch. 3) argue that it is odd to say that causal relations are empirical rather than logical. If A caused B, then the cause of B is A, and hence by substitution the cause of B caused B. Such a statement is also analytic, they argue, and hence causal statements are not incompatible with what has been argued above. But the objection does not serve. The analytic causal statement does not explain B, in fact it does not tell us anything more about B at all. With the intention-action linkage, we do learn more about the action, or rather what the action is. The abstract concept pairs of cause and consequence, intention and action, may both be conceptually linked. But the same is not true of substantive examples of cause and consequent (consider ball A moving because it was struck by ball B - there is no logical link here), whereas it is true of substantive intentions and actions (the illumination of the room was defined as the action by reference to the intention with which it was performed). Substantive intentions and actions are conceptually linked, whereas substantive causes and consequents are not. Three consequences of this conception of reasons-action relation sets deserve emphasis for our purposes. First, it makes possible a more general conception of action than the concept of the maximising agent allowed - ideological, normative, expressive, dramaturgical or com- municative (for an typification of such classes of action, see Habermas 1981:Part 1, ch. 1). All of these types of relation sets between reasons and actions are permissible, depending on the type of nestedness, the meaning-context that we locate the action in. Secondly, the conception of action can accommodate the fact that any one action may carry more than one meaning. Oedipus can genuinely express both his love for Jocasta, and live out his desire to possess his mother in the same doing. Or the agent may be both slaking thirst, and participating in a welcoming ceremony in the same drinking of a glass of water. Any one action may have more than one reason, without the puzzle about efficient causation that dogs the ontological conception of the reason-action relation set arising. Thirdly, and most importantly, it opens the possibility of a more</page><page sequence="21">An Economic Limit to Ethics 83 general conception of rationality, which could be deployed toward a general ethics. It is this that Habermas undertakes in Part 1 of the Theory of Communicative Action, 13 Habermas argues on the basis of a normal language argument that at its most general, 'rationality' may be defined as the ability to ground , that is give justification for claims to knowledge, or actions, with due regard for the context in which the claim or action is located (see Habermas 1981:Part 1, ch. 1). Only if such grounding can be provided, do we accept as rational claims to knowledge, the efficiency of chosen means to desired ends, the normative correctness of action, the expressive appositeness of affective self-presentation, or the appositeness of symbolic expres- sion. Such a concept of rationality is thin, in the sense that it carries no substantive content. Rationality is the deployment of the justifications of knowledge claims and actions the life world of agents places at their disposal. Rationality is pared to a purely procedural concept. But it is also argued to be a general concept of rationality, covering the submission of knowledge claims, teleological action, normative action, expressive and dramaturgical activity, and the use or manipu- lation of shared standards of value, or symbols. It is a concept of rationality which is to be operative across and throughout the life world of agents, and to be able to capture the concepts of action operative within the social sciences as applications of this, more general concept, to specific circumstance. Its generality moreover, is to serve as the basis of a universal hermeneutics, the basis not only of the comparison, but of the commensurability of different life worlds. It is this capacity which gives it the potential to provide the basis to a general ethics, and it is thus not surprising that it is toward this end that Habermas (1983) aims. Two problems I wish to raise two problems associated with the claim to generality of Habermas' concept of rationality. First, the concept is explicitly derived from a normal language argument, which raises the question as to whether it can serve to identify a universally acceptable concept of rationality. The normal language argument is couched in a specific, viz. late twentieth century occidental life world, and the question which faces Habermas is just how such a historically particular life world can come to provide the standard of comparison he requires for his universal hermeneutic. One possible response to such a challenge for Habermas is provided in his discussion of Winch's challenge to any attempt to</page><page sequence="22">84 Theoria construct a universal hermeneutic (see Habermas 1981:Part 1, ch. 2, Winch 1958). The argument is that any language game must, as long as it conveys meaning by means of symbolic representation, be engaged in the grounding of the different categories of knowledge claims and action, teleological, normative, expressive, or dramatur- gical. It does not matter whether it is a life world employing myth and oracles as interpretative devices, or the late twentieth century occidental life world: the grounding of claims to knowledge, or the efficiency of chosen means to desired ends, the normative correctness of action, and the expressive appositeness of self-presentation is common to both, though the form such grounding takes may be quite distinct. Winch is quite correct to point to the existence of networks of meaning between concepts, and that such meaning may well be intimately linked to pre-intentional practices of the agents in dealing with their environment, with a know-how rather than knowing-that which intimately shapes the sense agents have of their life world. But it is precisely this linkedness of concepts, of meaning, which makes the grounding of claims to knowledge, to normative correctness, and to efficiency of action, a necessary feature of linguistic interaction between agents. If it is correct that the life world of agents is but the symbiosis of interactively constituted intersubjectivities, it is prec- isely this that makes the process of argumentatively grounding claims a necessary feature of all life worlds. As long as meaning is conveyed linguistically, therefore, the grounding of claims is not only a necessary feature of the life world of agents located in such webs of meaning, but central to any activity conducted within such life worlds. And this provides us with a point of purchase which allows not only the comparison, but the commensura- bility of life worlds, of different cultures. For if it is true that all life worlds ground claims of various types, locate the claim in webs of concepts, and of pre-intentional know-how, all activity located in such life worlds becomes one of interpretation. Once again Winch is quite correct in drawing this inference. But this does not entail the conclusion that, since all claims are but interpretations constructed from within a specific context of meaning, there is no means of making the interpretations commensurable. Commensurability does not stem from the substantive content of the life worlds. On this level it is quite correct that the meanings that the life worlds embody are qualitatively distinct, and incommensur- able. But on the procedural level, or the meta-interpretative level on which life worlds undertake a reflexive turn in order to examine critically the interpretative activities of the tools the life world provides, commensurability is possible. For all life worlds, meaning</page><page sequence="23">An Economic Limit to Ethics 85 is interpretation. Any life world which has become self-conscious of the contingency of its embodied meanings, and institutes procedures which formalise the possibility of a critical self-examination of the content of its claims and activities, has a greater claim to universality than a life world which does not. It embodies the possibility of identifying, and replacing not only substantive interpretations, but also the interpretative procedures which the life world embodies. Such grounding is more comprehensive, more differentiated, and unleashes greater powers of understanding and successful interven- tion in our world than any unreflexive acceptance of given interpreta- tions can hope to achieve. It is at this level that modernity, and the social institutionalisation of its epistemological project in science, the efficient use of scarce resources in the pursuit of its ends (eg. in economic policy), its regulation of normative claims in positive law, its sensitivity to the interaction of different dramaturgical conventions, and the engage- ment of expressive need, becomes superior to that of mythological life worlds. The concretism of mythological life worlds, with their naturalistic vision of society, and anthropomorphic understanding of nature, which stems from the analogical form of categorisation of phenomena, does not admit of the conception of interpretation as interpretation. Modernity, by contrast, has undertaken a reflexive turn, is aware of the interpretive character of its claims. Activity, identity, purpose, meaning in modernity come to be located no longer in the substantive content of the claims to which it admits, but in the procedures by means of which it comes to arrive at, verify and to revise its claims. Meaning is located no longer in the content of the life world of agents, but in the processes by which they reflexively and intersubjectively come to constitute that world. It is in this reflexivity that the sensitivity to the possibility of faulty interpretation, and hence the capacity for revision of faulty interpre- tative devices rests. None of this is to say that modernity provides us with a Utopian world. The experience of the twentieth century has put paid to any such idea. Bauman (1989) for instance argues that the occurrence of the Holocaust is intimately connected with the conceptual and technological apparatus which only modernity could provide. In particular, it is the awareness of the possibility of the systematic manipulation of social reality that the reflexivity of modernity provides, which is argued to be a necessary condition of the Holocaust and the Gulag. Sloterdyk (1983) provides further analysis of how the reflexive turn is available not only to the oppressed, but to the oppressor, empowering not only those who are disadvantaged, but allowing the advantaged to cynically employ precisely the sophisti- cated reflexive awareness of the variety of interpretative mechanisms</page><page sequence="24">86 Theoria (including those of control and meta-control) in use, for the preservation of their advantage. All of this is well taken. Modernity has its dark side of awesome proportion and consequence. But it also has the capacity to provide the self-awareness, the reflexivity, to identify, to isolate this darkness, and to activate defences against it. No matter what the subtlety of the subterfuge, and the awareness of the power of reflexive interpretation that the oppressor may have, the reflexive turn has placed the unmasking of deceit permanently on the agenda. It is this capacity, this quasi-escape from its own terms of reference that provides modernity with its claim to greater generality than that which came before, and continues to hold open the promise of increased emancipation. The charge that Habermas' discursive concept of rationality is life world specific, can, therefore, be averted. But there is a second source of particularism which may be argued to attach to the concept. Habermas' concept of rationality is action-theoretic. It rests on the activity of grounding claims and actions in meaning-contexts pro- vided by the life world of the relevant agents. An associated claim is that the concept of (communicative) action which underlies it is foundational to all substantive examples of action. Yet this is the source of the difficulty. One might argue that it is itself merely a variant of teleological, or goal-oriented action (in fact, in Habermas 1981:Part 1, ch. 3, Habermas accepts that there is a teleological moment at the heart of his concept of rationality). The process of grounding, as exemplified in the theory of argumentation which underlies communicative action, is based on intentional activity of agents, oriented toward the development of intersubjectively shared situation definitions. Grounding knowledge claims, claims to normat- ive correctness, etc., is goal-oriented, and hence is conceivable in teleological terms. Again this raises doubts as to the generality of the concept of rationality based on such a conception of action, and the possibility of justifying the existence of a universal hermeneutic on such a concept of rationality. After all, the initial purpose of the Habermasian concept of rationality was to find a common foundation to all forms of action of which teleological action is but one. In the first intermediate reflection of the Theory of Communicative Action (see Habermas 1981 :369ff, on which the discussion below is based), Habermas provides the elements of a rebuttal of the notion that communicative action is itself teleological. He argues that communi- cative action is to be understood in terms of a model of language which precludes an intentional semantics. Language is not shaped by a semantics of representation (Carnap), nor by a semantics based on</page><page sequence="25">An Economic Limit to Ethics 87 the truth conditions of statements (Frege, Wittgenstein I, Davidson, Dummett), but by a semantics of speech acts (Wittgenstein II, Austin, Searle) or a use-theory of meaning. Such a semantics must be capable of capturing not only the representational function of assertions, but the appellative function of the submission of normative claims, and the expressive function of the portrayal of the internal experiences of agents also. Habermas argues that Austin's concept of illocutionary, as opposed to locutionary and perlocutionary speech acts are foundational to communicative interaction. All linguistic activity presupposes the existence of a shared body of usage, embodying meaning not only in a representational sense, but in the identification of normative stan- dards, and of expressive needs. The point is that made by Cavell ( 1 976 - which is also strongly influenced by Austin's work), viz. that semantics is deeply rooted in, or interwoven with pragmatics. A statement we use cannot be made to mean whatever we choose, since it is always made from within a language. If a speaker is committed to communication with hearers of a language, he/she does not have a choice about whether to use the language or not, and using the language entails abiding by the rules of that language (Cavell 1976: 12f). Language imposes a normativeness, a context which includes intimately the way in which words, and combinations of words are used, under what circumstances. But it also shapes that context, in the sense that it provides us with enabling conditions which allow us to perform actions such as promises, make assertions etc. Learning a language is also learning a pragmatics (see Cavell 1976:19-20, 32, 33-4) which prevents us from being able to choose what we wish to mean to say by a word, statement or action. They are bound into webs of concepts, pre-intentional know-how, and pragmatic contexts which place them irreducibly into a public domain, give them meaning independently of what the speaker or agent intends to give them. This much one can follow. But Habermas argues further that perlocutionary speech acts are quite distinct from illocutionary speech acts, on the grounds that the former are, whereas the latter are not, teleological. Illocution aims at communication, perlocution at the teleological manipulation of the hearer toward the ends of the speaker. The point is that perlocutionary manipulation of the hearer by the speaker, toward the speaker's desired ends, presupposes the existence of a shared pool of meaning, which can be strategically employed by the speaker. Illocutionary speech acts by contrast are not teleological, but are aimed immediately, or directly at communication (Habermas 1981: 389, 394). Illocutionary acts are constrained by their vehicle. A statement exists, comes to be constituted only in public space, in an</page><page sequence="26">88 Theoria intersubjectively shared space of linguistic practices. A statement cannot mean whatever the speaker wishes it to mean. Language is not private, so that the meaning of statements, and the acts that agents perform with such statements, are pre-intentional, in the sense that they precede the intention of agents in uttering such statements. It is this sharp categorical distinction between illocution and perlocution that is a potential problem. It may be true that illocution- ary acts are foundational to the deployment of all linguistic activity. Meaning is pre-formed by the practices of the linguistic space about us, and communication faces the a priori of networks of meaning and pre-intentional know-how, without which it cannot be. But the activation of meaning, the utterance of statements, or the deployment of illocution is surely dependent on linguistic agents, and their intentions? We do not just speak, we speak with purpose. Language is available to us as a pool of potentiality - but it remains for us to enter it, orient ourselves within it, and then to move, purposefully, within it so as to achieve our goals. Our speaking is not directionless, but oriented, purposeful, intentional. The implication here is that illocutionary acts, being intentional, can also be conceived of in teleological terms. Far from being free from a success-orientation, it too has its own criteria of efficiency in the attainment of given goals. We have arrived once more at a situation in which action is conceived of as goal-oriented, the source of the particularism that was attributed to economic explanations of action at the outset of this paper. Even Habermas' 'general' concept of rationality, with its explicit concern for embracing all forms of action, appears, at its core, to contain this particularity. Conclusion So what is it that we have achieved? I began by pointing to charges laid against economics that its fundamental action-theoretic concept, which simultaneously serves as its concept of rationality, is too particularistic to enable it to capture the complexity of social phenomena, let alone to serve as a sound basis for policy formulation. The argument here has been that if one takes such concerns seriously, the same charges of particularism can be levelled at perhaps the most sophisticated attempt at a general ethics formulated over the past decades. Rawls too, at the basis of his model of justice of fairness has the same concept of rationality as deployed by economists. Nor was the attempt to arrive at a more general concept of rationality along the lines argued for by Habermas more successful. There too, communicative action remained irreducibly teleological,</page><page sequence="27">An Economic Limit to Ethics 89 and hence not fundamentally distinct from the concept of action which economists deploy. Two questions pose themselves as corollaries to this argument. The first is whether the implicit assumption that has underpinned this paper, that a general ethics requires a general concept of rationality as a foundation, is well founded. Is it necessary to have such a concept supporting a general ethics, or are conditions specifiable where this is not the case? This is another means of asking just what role rationality is to play in the formulation of an ethical theory and its application to social reality. The second question is whether it is correct to say that the teleological conception of agency is indeed too particularistic. Again, this has implicitly informed the argument of this paper, and yet the teleological conception of agency and its linkage to concepts of rationality proves curiously intractable. All conceptions of rationality, even those that consciously attempt to escape the teleological action-theoretic base, seem to be forced back to it, to be unable to escape its power, or protean nature. This paper does not provide many answers. But it does point out that the charge of particularism levelled at economists' conception of agency, if taken seriously, can be damaging beyond the scope of economics. It questions the generality not only of the work of economists, but points to limits in prominent attempts at formulating a general ethics, or a general standard of rationality to support such an ethics. And perhaps goes on to question the coherence of the charge of particularism which informed it. NOTES 1 . That a characterisation of social forms is possible according to the types of agency that it embodies, and is constituted by, Habermas himself argues for in Habermas 1981, see particularly ch. 2 of Part 1. Note also that such a characterisation of the knowledge conditions, may entail probabilistic knowledge of the placement of individuals in society. 2. This point might be defended against game-theoretic intuitions along the Hofstadter line, that agents are rational, and know each other to be rational, and hence capable of identical deliberations. Agents must thus always act on the assumption that other agents will choose in identical fashion. Choices of agents will thus tend to be cooperative, and mutually beneficial where this is possible - see H. I. Brown 1988: 3-6 for an exposition. 3. For an example almost at random, see the discussion in Varían 1984:1-6. 4. In fact Wolff is not, strictly speaking, correct in saying that the economics of the firm holds firms to such uni-dimensional objective functions. Managerial theories of the firm specify more differentiated objectives for firms. As a general question of degree, however, one may accept that firms have more limited objectives than individuals. 5. This is not necessarily the case. Luhmann 1967 argues that systems, or organisations, can come to change their goals under certain circumstances, and this is reflected in the literature on institutional economics.</page><page sequence="28">90 Theoria 6. See Hahn 1 984, who argues that if objective functions are understood in terms of characteristics, rather than goods, they can be taken to be stable over time. 7. While I have argued that the arguments considered are not telling, Sandel 1 982, in his comparison of the moral subject in Rawls and Kant, does offer a strong challenge to Rawls. 8. Risk characterises situations in which we have - perhaps subjective - probability distributions concerning the outcomes of our interventions in the world, see Hirschleifer and Riley 1979 for an overview, and Hodgson 1988:76. 9. Under uncertainty agents no longer have any information for probability distribu- tions, even subjective ones; a rule of minimaxing regret has been suggested in this context, see Elster 1979:1 17-22. 10. At least this is the explicit position taken by Rawls. It may perhaps be argued that the view of the moral subject deployed above to defend the Rawlsian project, precludes such a narrow concept of rationality. See for instance Rawls 1971: §64, §68 for intimations to this effect. 1 1 . The example chosen here is perhaps misleading. To make the point I do in the following discussion, it is not necessary to invoke deep inner drives. It suffices for my purposes that we may be mistaken about the reasons for our actions, at least some of the time. For instance, in a social setting I may take a drink purportedly because I am thirsty, yet accept without too much deliberation that the 'true' reason for accepting the drink was merely the need to appear sociable. It is such instances, which 1 believe to be common, where we associate reasons with actions which we come to reject of our own volition, or without the need for deep analysis, which are perhaps paradigmatic for the concern I voice at this point. I keep Oedipus and Jocasta merely for ease of reference. 12. To be precise, the causal account of action was dismissed only insofar as the causal link was posited between reasons and actions. Causal explanations of actions may well be, or come to be, available where the ex planantia are not reasons. From what will be argued in this section, it should be clear that reasons are excluded from causal explanations of action in principle, however. 13. The development and clarification of the argument below owes much to extensive discussions with Raphael de Kadt, and Jenny Robinson on the work of Jürgen Habermas. Perhaps inappropriately, for a Habermasian communicative context such as those discussions provided, the conventional disclaimer applies. BIBLIOGRAPHY Ackerlof, G.
