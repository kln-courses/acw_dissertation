<plain_text><page sequence="1">Measurement in Carnap's late Philosophy of Science1 Vadim Batitsky* 1. Introduction The concept of observation and the associated theoretical-observational dichotomy certainly have been among the most criticized aspects of Carnap's philosophy of science. Examples of well-known and much repeated criticisms (whose 'classic' or 'near classic' status makes it unnecessary to rehearse them here) include Maxwell (1962) (extended in Hacking 1983; Kosso 1989; Suppe 1989), Hanson (1958), Popper (1965), Achinstein (1968), Kuhn (1970), Fey- erabend (1975), and Putnam (1979) (given more elaborate treatments in Kosso 1989; Suppe 1989) to mention just some. The central aim of this paper is to show that these and many similar, ob- servation-directed criticisms of Carnap present an incomplete and, as a result, significantly distorted picture of his final interpretation of theory- world rela- tions. First, all such criticisms take observation (qua unaided sensory percep- tion) to be Carnap's only epistemically legitimate link between theories and the world. This, I will argue, grossly misrepresents Carnap's (1966) final ac- count of how theories relate to the world - the account on which the relevant epistemologica! and methodological link between theories and the world is es- Philosophy Department, St. John's University, New York, e-mail: batitskv@stjohns.edu 1 I'm indebted to Zoltan Domotor for many discussions of Carnap's philosophy of science against the background of mathematical and philosophical problems in measurement theory.

Second, I will discuss why Carnap's belated (and largely neglected) shift from observation to measurement is a shift in the right direction. For, under- stood in the above sense, measurement is the only basis on which we can meaningfully characterize how quantitative theories are linked to the world. This, in turn, will show that the price of neglecting this shift in Carnap's views has been paid not only by a widespread oversimplification of Carnap's phi- losophy of science, but also by an embarrassing multitude of post-Carnap writ- ings on theory-world relations which either (a) ignore measurement altogether and continue the philosophically unprofitable scrutiny of how and to what ex- tent theories are linked to the world by observation (e.g., Boyd, 1980, 1984; Laudan 1984; Leplin 1984; Hooker 1987), (b) conflate measurement with (in- strument-assisted) detection (e.g., Feyerabend 1981; Hacking 1983; Kosso 1989), betraying no awareness that detection as such (no matter how compli- cated the gadgetry) has little to do with systematic assignments of quantitative values to physical objects and, thus, is a much weaker concept than that of measurement, or (c) take it for granted that numbers somehow 'glue' them- selves onto the physical world to make our quantitative theorizing possible (e.g., Quine 1981, 52; Cartwright 1983, 133-134). Finally, I will discuss why Carnap's measurement-based interpretation of science, while far more sophisticated than his earlier proposals, is still unten- able, albeit for reasons that cannot be discovered, much less corrected, by ob- servation-directed criticisms. To this end, I will closely examine some defects in Carnap's analysis of measurement and argue that although these defects can be corrected, the required corrections (and, hence, an adequate account of measurement) are incompatible with the empiricist commitments of Carnap's approach to theory- world relations and theory acceptance. Throughout the en- tire discussion, my perspective on Carnap will be that of a philosopher of sci- ence who sees valuable lessons to be learned from both a correct understand- ing of the flaws in Carnap's account of measurement and the reasons why an adequate account of measurement is incompatible with Carnap's empiricism. 2. Carnap's Shift from Observation to Measurement In the early stages of his philosophical career, Carnap indeed characterized observation in science in terms of what is accessible to human unaided sen- sory perception. In Carnap (1936/1937, reprinted as Carnap 1950), for exam-</page><page sequence="3">Measurement in Carnap 's late philosophy of science 89 pie, the predicate 'řeď is discussed as a paradigmatic example of "observa- tional predicates" because it denotes a property which is "observable for a per- son ... possessing a normal colour sense" (1950, 455). Similarly, in Carnap (1939, 32) possession of "normal senses" is described as the basis for under- standing "a language in which observable properties of things can be de- scribed". Needless to say, such a restricted (and blatantly anthropomorphic) construal of observation in science is vulnerable to numerous objections, in- cluding those mentioned in the introductory section. In his late writings (e.g., Carnap 1956; 1958, reprinted in translation as Car- nap 1975), however, there is no longer an explicit characterization of observ- ability in science in terms of human sensory perception. To be sure, there is still the "observational" part of "the language of science", but our understanding of this "observational language" is no longer explicitly grounded in sensory per- ception. Instead, Carnap takes it to be sufficient to say no more than that "a complete interpretation of this language is given" (1956, 40) or that "[t]he sen- tences of this language are assumed to be fully understood" (1975, 85). The explicit departure from identifying what is observable in science with what is accessible to human sensory perception comes in Carnap's last book, The Philosophical Foundations of Physics (1966). There, Carnap radically re- duces the role of observation in linking theories to the world to make room for measurement. As for observation, Carnap now cautions us not to confuse the philosopher's notion 'observation' with that of the physicist. For where the philosopher's notion of observation applies only to "properties directly per- ceived by the senses", the physicist's notion of observation "has a much broader meaning . . . [and] . . . includes any quantitative magnitude that can be measured in a relatively simple , direct way " (1966, 225, italics mine). (In Section 4, 1 will look closely at Carnap's never defined qualification of meas- urements as "simple". For now, it will suffice to think of simple measurements in terms of Carnap's examples of measuring length with a measuring-rod, or measuring time with an ordinary clock.) Additionally, Carnap revised his earlier analysis of the structure of theo- ries and theory- world relations so as to accommodate the scientist's episte- mologica! and methodological boundary separating physical attributes which are measurable by simple techniques from those which are not. While Carnap retained his syntactic conception of theories as "partially interpreted" formal systems (Carnap 1956, 1958, 1966), the theory's postulates are now divided beyond the earlier categories of "theoretical postulates" and "correspondence rules". Theoretical postulates are themselves partitioned into "empirical laws" and "theoretical laws", where "empirical laws ... are laws containing terms [re-</page><page sequence="4">90 Vadim Batitsky ferring to physical attributes which are] either directly observable by the senses or measurable by relatively simple techniques while theoretical laws are generalizations about attributes "that cannot be measured in simple , direct ways" (1966, 226-227 , italics mine). (As will be seen shortly, Carnap's reten- tion of observation along with "simple measurements" as a link between "em- pirical laws" and the world is largely gratuitous, since the kind of laws he is most interested in are quantitative laws. And such laws, stated in the language of mathematics - e.g., as equations defined over number or vector-valued functions - do not say anything directly about the physical world at all, much less about the world "directly observable by the senses".) The picture of theory-world relations which emerges as a result of Carnap's emphasis on measurement is no longer the usually discussed two-level "the- ory/observation" hierarchy, where theories are linked to (and partially inter- preted by) unaided sensory perception via correspondence rules. Instead, with theoretical postulates further divided into theoretical and empirical laws, a the- ory's link to the world is described in terms of a more complex three-level hierarchy, where empirical laws are directly linked to the world through sim- ple measurements, while theoretical laws are linked to the world indirectly by having some empirical laws as their logical consequences (1966, 229-230). Before taking a closer look at Carnap's (1966) lengthy and involved ac- count of measurement, it will be well to say a few words about why his be- lated embrace of measurement as a primary link between theories and the world is a significant and much needed improvement of his earlier views. The reason is that the majority of theories in the natural sciences are quantitative descriptions of the world that employ mathematical constructs for represent- ing attributes and relations of objects in the world. Whether we look at theo- ries syntactically as Carnap's interpreted formal axiomatic systems or seman- tically as classes of models (e.g., in Suppes 1967; Sneed 1971; Wojcicki 1974; Balzer et al. 1988; Suppe 1989), the relevant attributes of objects in the do- main of the theory or a model (e.g., mass, position, charge, etc.) are repre- sented by functions from that domain into the set of real numbers, complex numbers, real or complex vectors, etc. And the relevant relations among ob- jects in the domain of the theory or a model (e.g., gravitational attraction) are represented by equations , inequalities or proportions among the quantitative representations of these objects' attributes. In short, without some addition- ally specified non-mathematical interpretation, a quantitative theory in science is just a mathematical structure erected over some assortment of mathemati- cal domains: numbers, vectors, functions, and so on. So much is already ac- knowledged in Carnap (1975) where he tells us that we should construe the</page><page sequence="5">Measurement in Carnap 's late philosophy of science 91 theoretical part of the language of science as just the language of mathemat- ics in which "[theoretical] terms designate mathematical objects ... which, however, are physically characterized [by correspondence rules linking them to the observable world]" (Carnap 1975, 81). With so many scientific theories coached in the language of mathematics, it is really difficult to make sense of the traditional, observation-directed dis- cussions of theory-world relations. For, in testing quantitative theories, scien- tists are not at all interested in observation per se, whether characterized as van Fraassen's "unaided sensory perception", Quine's "retinal surface irritations", Maxwell-Hacking's "instrument assisted", Hanson-Kuhn-Feyerabend's "the- ory/ideology-laden," or whatever. What scientists are interested in are those in- teractions with the world which justify a systematic assignments of quantitative values to physical attributes of objects described by the tested theory. For it is only interactions of the latter kind that can be legitimately called 'measurement' and can establish a meaningful connection (or lack thereof) between quantita- tive theories and the world by enabling us to compare two classes of quantita- tive values: those imputed to physical objects by a theory and those assigned by us to the said objects on the basis of certain interactions with the world. For a philosopher of science pursuing a comprehensive interpretation of theory- world relations, to acknowledge and to emphasize (as Carnap belatedly did) the central role of quantitative concepts in so many scientific theories is to face the formidable task of explaining how quantitative concepts relate to the physical world. For Carnap, the desired explanation is provided by a very special class of correspondence rules which he calls "rules of measurement". Generally speaking, Carnap's rules of measurement are meant to specify cer- tain interactions with objects possessing a given attribute which tell us how to assign a number to the 'amount' or 'degree' of the attribute possessed by an object (1966, 63, 104). For the sake of concreteness, I will focus on Carnap's rules of measurement for length, one of his favorite examples.2 These rules 2 Following the literature in measurement theory, Ī will replace Carnap's specification of the comparison relation as linear ordering with a more general weak ordering from which the former can be easily defined. Additionally, I will ignore Carnap's separate "rule of equali- ty" (specifying a binary physical relation which implies the identity of numerical values assig- ned to the 'amounts' of an attribute) because an equivalence comparison relation can be defi- ned from the weak ordering relation. Also, for the sake of simplicity, I will treat length (just as Carnap did) from the perspective of classical physics, ignoring any relativistic or quantum- mechanical considerations. Finally, I will follow Carnap in ignoring various physical assump- tions underlying measurement of length, e.g., that measuring-rods are perfectly rigid, that they are protected from thermal expansion, corrosion, etc. None of these assumptions, however, will be important for the present discussion. (See Kyburg 1984 for a detailed critical discussion of these and many other empirically problematic assumptions underlying measurement.)</page><page sequence="6">92 Vadim Batitsky specify, for some domain D of 'length-bearing' objects, which, following Car- nap (1966, 103), we shall presume to be rods, 1) a (binary) empirical comparison relation x ^ y on D (which, without loss of generality, can be interpreted as holding when two rods x and y are placed side by side with their ends on one side coinciding and the opposite end of x does not extend beyond the opposite end of y)' and 2) a (binary) empirical composition operation x®y on D (which, again without loss of generality, can be interpreted as collinear juxtaposition of rods x and y), such that the order-theoretic and algebraic properties of this relation and op- eration respectively guarantee the existence of a real- valued function Length : D - &gt; R+ satisfying (i) x^y =&gt; Length(x) &lt; Length(y), and (ii) Length(x(By)= Length(x)+Length(y), for all x,y in D. (In Section 4, 1 will look closely at Carnap's never elaborated qualification of relations and operations as 'empirical'. For the time being, it will suffice to think of such relations and operations as involving only manipulations of 'or- dinary-sizeď objects such as juxtaposition of rods or placing objects on pans of an equal-arm balance.) Introducing rules of measurement into his analysis of theory-world relations provides Carnap with (what he sees as) an attractively demystifying explanation of how simple measurements take us from the empirical manipulations of ob- jects in the world to quantitative values of these objects' attributes. For, suppos- edly3, rules of measurement guarantee that these empirical relations/operations imply (are mirrored in) certain mathematical relations/operations on numbers. With this correspondence between the empirical and the mathematical rela- tions/operations, Carnap sees no mystery in the fact that the scientist represents the physical world by numbers and, then, successfully predicts the behavior of the world by reasoning about numbers. Just as we can successfully use mirror re- flections of ourselves to reason about our appearance (based on a correspondence between our bodies and their mirror images), the scientist can reason about the world by reasoning about its 'reflections' in the 'mathematical mirror'. 3 I say 'supposedly' because when the logical structure of some relations/operations is fully specified, the question of whether these relations/operations imply certain mathematical relations/operations can be answered only by a mathematical proof. No such proofs, however, are given in Carnap's discussion of rules of measurement.</page><page sequence="7">Measurement in Carnap 's late philosophy of science 93 The preceding outline of Carnap's measurement-based analysis of theory- world relations makes it quite clear, I believe, that in order to evaluate (let alone reject) this analysis, we must ask questions quite different from those asked by the traditional, observation-directed criticisms of Carnap's philoso- phy of science. For example, we better ask about what makes measurements "simple" and what makes a physical relation/operation involved in such meas- urements "empirical". For these qualifications, while never clarified by Car- nap, carry a heavy philosophical load in his measurement-based account of how theories relate to the world. Even more pressing is the question of whether the kind of correspondence between the physical and the mathematical sides of measurement proposed by Carnap's rules of measurement justifies the methodological and epistemologica! adequacy of testing theories by compar- ing calculated quantities (theoretical predictions) with quantities obtained through actual physical interactions with the world (measurement results). In short, without answers to these (and related) questions about the physical and the mathematical aspects of measurement, Carnap's final views on theory- world relations can be neither accepted nor rejected in an intellectually re- sponsible manner. In the remaining sections, I will discuss how answers to these questions expose insuperable difficulties in Carnap's last interpretation of science. In Section 3, I will explain why the physical-to-mathematical correspondence provided by Carnap's rules of measurement is too weak to justify the adequacy of our quantitative representations of physical attributes. In Sections 4 and 5, I will argue that the required strengthening of Carnap's rules of measurement, while fairly uncomplicated, cannot be reconciled with his empiricist approach to theory-world relations and theory acceptance. 3. A closer look at Carnap's rules of measurement As was seen in the preceding section, part (i) of Carnap's rules of meas- urement (for the attribute 'length') requires that the specified empirical com- parison relation x š y implies the numerical relation Length(x)&lt; Length(y). This implication, however, is too weak to justify the adequacy of our numer- ical assignments. To see why, consider first that one truly remarkable utility of measurement is that it allows us to replace actual manipulations of physi- cal objects (e.g., sweatily aggregating bookshelves side by side against the wall to determine how many will fit the length of that wall) with calculations (e.g., dividing the number representing the length of the wall by the number representing the width of one bookshelf). That we so confidently expect the</page><page sequence="8">94 Vadim Batitsky results of calculations on numbers to tell us something about the results of physical manipulations of objects in the world shows that, in addition to the above implication, we also expect certain mathematical relations/operations on numbers to imply certain physical relations/operations on objects (say, that a side-by-side aggregation of five, but not six, bookshelves will fit along the wall). And it is only when we add this reverse implication to Carnap's rules of measurement that we can meaningfully test quantitative theories by com- paring calculated ( computed , predicted ) values of physical attributes with those obtained by actual manipulations of physical objects specified by perti- nent rules of measurement. It will be well to look at this a bit closer. We have already seen that if T is a quantitative theory, it really says nothing directly about the world. All T says is that certain mathematical relations hold for certain mathematical constructs (numbers, vectors, functions, etc.). It is only when we interpret these mathe- matical constructs as representing physical attributes (as, e.g., we interpret the real number variables in the ideal gas equation in terms of physical attributes pressure , volume and temperature respectively) that we can convert mathe- matical assertions made by theory T into assertions about the physical world. With this in mind, to maintain, as Carnap (1966, 21) did, that certain meas- urement results can confirm (disconfirm) theory T is to say that the quantita- tive values of attributes in the domain of T obtained through measurements satisfy (do not satisfy) the mathematical relations specified by T Alternatively, theory T would be confirmed (disconfirmed) every time it specifies correctly (incorrectly) what quantitative measurement results should be expected (mod- ulo admissible approximations) on the basis of antecedently obtained quanti- tative measurement results (the latter often called 'initial conditions'). But if we require our measurements to satisfy only Carnap's physical-to-mathemat- ical implication, then we have no reason to think (as we do) that a significant disagreement between calculated values of physical attributes (T's predic- tions) and those obtained through certain physical interactions with the world (measurements) indicates that there is something wrong with T. What this shows, I believe, is that our testing of quantitative theories rests on a crucial epistemological commitment, only one half of which is reflected by Carnap's rules of measurement. This commitment is our belief in the equiv- alence (with respect to some logical structure) between certain mathematical relations/operations on the quantitative values assigned to physical objects' at- tributes and certain physical relations/operations on objects having these at- tributes. And it is this commitment that enables us to characterize some nu- merical assignments as 'measurements', while dismissing other assignments</page><page sequence="9">Measurement in Carnap 's late philosophy of science 95 as 'arbitrary' or 'physically meaningless'. It is also this commitment that al- lows us to point the arrow of blame at the theory when (carefully repeated) measurement procedures produce quantitative values significantly different from those calculated (predicted) by the theory. Again, it will be well to pause and to dig into this commitment a bit deeper. One fact about our physical interactions with the world is that, to be mean- ingful as a means for testing quantitative theories, such interactions always must be augmented by three irreducibly cognitive steps: (1) using the theory's mathematical apparatus for calculating (predict- ing) quantitative values of certain physical attributes of objects (on the basis of some antecedently established 'initial conditions'), (2) assigning quantitative values to objects to represent actual "amounts" or "degrees" of their physical attributes in question, and (3) comparing quantitative values obtained by steps (1) and (2). Carnap certainly was aware of this essentially cognitive aspect of measu- rement when he remarked that "Quantitative concepts are not given by nature" (1966, 105) and that "It is we who assign numbers to nature (1966, 100, ita- lics in the original). Yet while our physical interactions with the world are in many ways phys- ically constrained by the world itself (e.g., we can't eliminate gravity, or com- pare the masses of two planets using an equal-arm balance scale, or probe the core temperature of a blue giant star, etc.), there are no physical constraints whatsoever on how we choose to assign numbers to various features of the world and what calculations we may perform on already assigned numbers. (Pythagoreans and other number mystics are a proof of that.) What does con- strain our cognitive "number-assignment" and "calculation" stages of theory testing is the earlier described belief in the structural equivalence between cer- tain mathematical relations/operations on numbers and certain physical rela- tions/operations on objects possessing certain attributes. And what makes this belief so important (despite its largely implicit nature) is that, without it, any numerical value assignment (and any calculation on such assignments), no matter how arbitrary, can be treated as yielding a 'measurement result' (or 'the- oretical prediction'), allowing us to manufacture, confirm and disconfirm quantitative theories at will! Augmenting the physical-to-mathematical implication in Carnap's rules of measurement with the reverse mathematical-to-physical implication amounts to nothing more complicated than replacing the material conditional in part (i) of his rules of measurement (see Section 2) with a biconditional. In the ter-</page><page sequence="10">96 Vadim Batitsky minology of measurement theory, a function satisfying thus strengthened con- ditions constitutes a homomorphic embedding of the measurement structure (D, ©) into the numerical structure (R'&lt;,+). And a proof that such a func- tion indeed exists for some attribute (such as length) constitutes a so-called representation theorem for that attribute.4 (Detailed proofs and/or discussions of many representation theorems in measurement theory, including those for the so-called 'extensive quantities' (of which length is one) can be found in Suppes 1969a; Suppes and Zinnes 1963; Krantz et al. 1971; Narens 1985; to mention just some classic works on the foundations of measurement.) The philosophical importance of stipulating (as we do) that the numerical assignment function Length must satisfy the above conditions is that this stip- ulation reveals a certain attitude toward measurement of length - the attitude which, despite its tremendous epistemological and methodological signifi- cance, is far from being trivially or obviously correct. Namely, that our ac- ceptance of numerical representations of length (and other basic attributes such as mass, charge, etc.) as adequate is (at least in part) conditional upon our antecedent acceptance of structural equivalence between certain specified physical relations/operations on objects and certain specified mathematical re- lation/operations on numbers. Thus far I have discussed Carnap's rules of measurement for length and how these rules must be strengthened to justify the adequacy of our numeri- cal representation of length. In the next two sections, I will explain why there is a very heavy price that must be paid for this improvement by both Carnap's account of theory- world relations and his account of theory acceptance. What makes the strengthening of Carnap's rules of measurement so costly is that the required properties of the associated comparison relation and composition op- eration make it impossible to describe them as "empirical", even for meas- urement of such basic attributes as length, and even when length measurement is restricted to Carnap's examples of what can be measured by "simple tech- niques". In short, we shall see that the price of adequate rules of measurement is that their adequacy cannot be justified on empiricist grounds. 4 For reasons of simplicity, I have omitted mentioning a so-called 'uniqueness theorem* which often, though not always, accompanies representation theorems in measurement theory. The purpose of a uniqueness theorem for length measurement is to assure that such measure- ment is unique up to multiplicative positive real number constants. Formally, this theorem asserts that for any other function Length* satisfying the same conditions as Length, there is a positive real number r such that Length* (*)= r. Length (x) for all jcG D.</page><page sequence="11">Measurement in Carnap 's late philosophy of science 97 4. Measurement and Carnap 's account of Theory-World Relations The earlier promised clarification of Carnap's notion of "simple measure- ment" may, at first, seem hopeless because Carnap was quick to concede the arbitrariness of the line separating "simple" measurements from those which are not. This concession, however, reveals not Carnap's reluctance to commit himself to some specific conception of simple measurements, but only reluc- tance to impose his conception on others (1966, 226). To give us a fairly good idea of what he sees as simple measurements, Carnap offers several examples of those measurements which he considered simple as well as those which are more complicated and which he calls "derived". Measuring length with a rod (1966, 101) or a ruler (1966, 226), or measuring time with an ordinary clock (1966, 226) are Carnap's examples of simple measurements, whereas meas- uring intergalactic distances (1966, 102) or instantaneous acceleration (1966, 98) are his examples of derived measurement. Judging by Carnap's discussion of these and other examples, his distinc- tion between simple and derived measurement is very much in line with the distinction between fundamental and derived measurement in the literature on measurement theory (cf. Krantz et. al 1971). In this latter distinction, funda- mental measurement is construed as consisting of (i) determining qualitative (comparison) relations (e.g., that a certain mark on the ruler extends beyond (or coincides with) the edge of the desk), (ii) performing qualitative (composition) operations (e.g., placing two objects on one pan of an equal-arm balance, collinearly juxtaposing two rods, etc.), and (iii) assisting (i) and (ii) at most by simple counting.5 Derived measurement, on the other hand, is construed as fundamental measurement augmented by all sorts of abstract mathematical calculations. It is not hard to see, I believe, that Carnap's examples of simple measure- ments (e.g., measuring length with a rod or with a ruler, measuring time with an ordinary clock) are clearly examples of fundamental measurement in the above sense. For although some of these measurements employ an already established unit scale (e.g., unit marks on the ruler and on the clock), such scales themselves can be obtained from more primitive comparison relations 5 As stated in the now classic work on foundations of measurement by Krantz et al., fun- damental measurement consists of procedures "for assigning numbers to objects or events on the basis of qualitative observations of attributes" (1971, 2-3, italics mine).</page><page sequence="12">98 Vadim Batitsky and composition operations on objects. In the case of simple measurements of length, for example, these can be relations/operations on measuring rods de- scribed in the preceding section, which Carnap himself accepts as sufficient for that purpose (1966, 103). Similarly, Carnap's example of measuring astronomical distances or in- stantaneous acceleration are clearly examples of derived measurements. For they require some fairly complex calculations (such as triangulations in the former case and calculating the second derivative of a position function with respect to time in the latter) involving mathematical relations/operations which have no corresponding qualitative relations and operations. These examples, together with Carnap's lengthy discussion (1966, 51-104) of how the logical structure of qualitative relations/operations allows us (via rules of measurement) to assign numbers to physical attributes on the basis of "phenomena [which] themselves exhibit only qualities that we observe " (1966, 100, italics mine), shows that Carnap's simple measurements, while not so defined explicitly, are just those which involve (at least in principle, if not always in practice) only qualitative relations/operations. And it is because qualitative relations/operations are confined to the world accessible to our sen- sory perception, Carnap feels no need to justify his characterization of these relations/operations as "empirical" in specifying rules of measurement. With Carnap's notion of simple measurement clarified as measurement that involves only determining (performing) qualitative relations (operations), let us now return to measurement of length. In order for Carnap's rules of meas- urement to assure that our usual quantitative representation of length - the structure (R+,&lt;,+) - is adequate (as discussed in Section 3), the comparison re- lation ^ must be (among other things) transitive and Archimedean , while the composition operation © must be total.6 (See Suppes 1969a for a complete ax- iomatization and a proof of the representation theorem.) And here is where problems begin. We cannot interpret &lt; as a qualitative comparison relation "not noticeably longer than" on rods described in Section 2 (or any other equivalent qualitative comparison relation) because such qual- itative relations are not transitive, due to the fact that our perceptual discrim- ination capacities are not limitless (mathematically perfect). That is, we can arrange experiments which will lead the subject to assert 6 Formal definitions of these properties are as follows: For all x , v, z in D, (i) if x š y and y « z, then x &lt; z (transitivity of «); (n) if X &lt; y y then there is a natural number n such that y « nx, with nx defined recursively by 'x = je, nx = x © (w-l)x (the Archimedean property of &lt;s); (in) x © y e D (the totality of ©).</page><page sequence="13">Measurement in Carnap 's late philosophy of science 99 x,*x2, x2*x3, ..., xn_,*xn because the length difference between objects in each pair is below the thresh- old of the subject's perceptual discrimination capacities, and yet also will lead the subject to assert ^ X. * Xn because the amplified difference between x, and xn is above that threshold. (This problem has been emphasized repeatedly by Kyburg 1969, 1984, 1997). Nor can a qualitative comparison relation be Archimedean. The reason is that, in the context of measurement, the Archimedean property of an ordering (rank- ing) relation has a perfectly good physical meaning, whether this meaning is construed ontologically - as denying that (with respect to some attribute) there are infinitesimally (infinitely) small (large) objects, or modally as asserting that the "amount" of a given attribute possessed by any object can be exceeded (at least in principle) by finitely many compositions of replicas of any other object. There is, however, nothing whatsoever (to repeat Carnap's words) in "qualities that we observe" that would establish the truth of either assertion.7 Things look equally bad with respect to qualitative interpretability when we turn to the composition operation ©. To require this operation to be total is to commit oneself to qualitatively uninterpretable compositions of an object x with itself, i.e., x®x , as well as with objects of which x is a part, e.g., x®(x®y ).8 Additionally, this property of © implies an (actual or potential) in- finity of elements in D (or, alternatively, the existence of arbitrarily long ob- jects in D). Yet, again, for finite creatures that we are, there is clearly nothing in the "qualities we observe" that could support such a commitment, whether in its 'actualist' or 'potentialist' guise. Of course, Carnap himself did not discuss any of these problems precisely because his rules of measurement were too weak to impose such qualitatively uninterpretable properties on physical relations/operations involved in length measurement. (His analysis of measurement derives not from the then already ongoing research on the mathematical foundations of measurement, but from an earlier and equally inadequate analysis of Hempel 1952.) But this is not to 7 The notion of 'replica' in the second physical interpretation of the Archimedean pro- perty also requires either an (actually or potentially) infinite supply of replicas for every rod (or material for making such replicas) or a substance ontology on which a rod can be sliced length- wise arbitrary many times. Surely neither assumption would qualify as "empirical" in Carnap's scheme of things. Even worse, the relation 4jc is a replica of y' if interpreted qualitatively, is not transitive (for the same reason that « not transitive) and, thus, is not equivalent to the nume- rical relation Length(x)=Length(y). 8 Interpreting such composition as involving replicas or rods will not help for reasons discussed in footnote 7.</page><page sequence="14">100 Vadim Batitsky say that such problems could not be removed individually in the ways which would still yield adequate numerical representation of length. For example, the problem posed by the transitivity of ^ can be avoided by making transitivity a stochastic property (e.g., along the lines of Suppes et al. 1989, 300; or Kyburg 1997), thus accommodating occasional non-transitive judgments of relative length. As regards the composition operation ©, impos- sible compositions can be excluded via suitable mereological constraints on this operation (Batitsky 1998a, 59-60). The infinity of rods implied by the clo- sure property of © also can be avoided by following Suppes' (1969, 5-9) sug- gestion of employing finite ordered Boolean algebras ofsets as our measure- ment structures in which sets represent collections of rods and the composition operation is absorbed into the set-theoretic union operation. Upon closer scrutiny, however, none of these proposals succeeds in justify- ing the adequacy of our quantitative representation of length in qualitative terms alone. Showing that this is so in full detail is a rather lengthy and involved task (see Batitsky 1998a), so here I will only indicate some of the reasons why such modifications of measurement structures for length fall short of providing a qualitative interpretation to the associated relations and operations. Generally, the common problem with such modifications of the usual measurement structure for length is that in removing some qualitatively unin- terpretable properties of the associated physical relations/operations, these modifications invariably introduce (though not always explicitly) new as- sumptions which are equally resistant to qualitative interpretation. Thus, for example, a stochastic construal of transitivity of &lt; requires an auxiliary prob- ability structure: i.e., a domain (e.g., of events or propositions of some formal language) with an ordering relation (e.g., determined by an agent's confidence judgments with respect to one event being at most as probable as another) and a composition operation which would guarantee a probability measure on that domain: an additive mapping from that domain into the [0,1] interval of real numbers satisfying the axioms for probability calculus. And, depending on a particular axiomatization of probability structures, these assumptions will in- clude many of the qualitatively uninterpretable idealizations and abstractions present in measurement structures for length, such as the transitivity and the Archimedean property of the ordering relation, the null element (representing the 'impossible event' in the algebra of events) and other abstract and ideal- ized structural assumptions required for the existence of a probability meas- ure (Batitsky 1998a, 63). As for replacing the usual infinite measurement structures with finite or- dered Boolean algebras of sets, this not only leaves the problem of impossi-</page><page sequence="15">Measurement in Carnap 's late philosophy of science 101 ble compositions unsolved, but also introduces new qualitatively uninter- pretable features, such as the null set of rods (Batitsky 1998a, 58-59). Last, but not least, while certain mereological constraints on length meas- urement do avoid impossible compositions of rods, these constraints cannot be completely specified without assuming some amount of geometry required for defining 'parts' as obtained by dividing a rod in a plane perpendicular to the direction of the rod's length . (Such a definition is needed to exclude 'ir- relevant' parts, such as those chipped out of a rod, whose removal would not affect the rod's length.) Yet this auxiliary (Euclidean) geometry, even if finite, requires a number of highly technical second-order structural conditions to be imposed on the pertinent relations (order, betweenness, orthogonality, etc.) to assure the existence of an Euclidean distance metric. And these conditions are just as resistant to qualitative interpretation as those imposed on the relations and operations in non-mereological measurement structures for length (Batit- sky 1998a, 60). To my mind, the failure to justify our quantitative representations of phys- ical attributes in qualitative terms is not all that surprising.9 After all, even without poking into the (often very complicated) mathematics behind repre- sentation theorems in measurement theory, it should have sounded awfully im- plausible that our finite, 'imperfect' and 'imprecise' qualitative interactions with the world embody enough structure to mirror infinite, 'perfect' and 'pre- cise' quantitative structures we use as calculationally efficient quantitative representations of physical attributes. For Carnap (and any empiricist in general), however, failure to justify the adequacy of even simple measurements in qualitative (empirical) terms has an obviously disastrous consequence: Namely, that all measurements in science, no matter how "simple", involve "non-empirical" assumptions about the as- sociated physical relations/operations, the assumptions which cannot be re- duced to (repeating Carnap once more) "qualities that we observe". And this means that Carnap's measurement-based account of theory-world relations does not (and cannot) restrict the 'factual' import of quantitative scientific the- ories to the observable world alone. In retrospect, it is ironic that Carnap's discussion of measurement did even- tually lead him to embrace the "theoretical" status of all quantitative concepts 9 This failure extends at least as far back as Hume's failed attempt to give a qualitative interpretation of geometrical properties/relations representing spatial properties/relations of physical objects (see Batitsky 1998b).</page><page sequence="16">102 Vadim Batitsky in science, even the most basic ones such as length and mass (1966, 103). 10 I say 'ironic' because Carnap saw nothing theoretical in the concept length so long as we consider its application to ordinary-sized objects. Within this re- stricted scope of application, the concept length , in Carnap's words, is "cora- pletely defined by a simple measuring rod procedure" (1966, 103, italics mine). It is only the obvious uselessness of "simple measuring-rod procedure" (and other similarly simple procedures) for measurements of very large or very small lengths (e.g., distances between galaxies in astronomy, distances be- tween molecules in chemistry, cell dimensions in biology, etc.) that led Car- nap to describe our concept length as being theoretical and only "partially de- fined by the entire system of physics" (1966, 103, italics mine). As I have indicated above, however, an adequate specification of even a "simple measuring rod procedure" already amounts to a theory: a theory about physical relations/operations on objects which justify representing these ob- jects' length in a calculationally efficient quantitative structure. To insist on a full-fledged, explicitly formulated theory of length measurement , henceforth 7^m, and on similar theories for measurement of other basic attributes, may sound pedantic but it has the virtue of making explicit the fascinating (and all too often taken for granted) fact. Namely, that our faith in quantitative meth- ods of theorizing about the world rest on a fundamental assumption of math- ematical representability of the physical world (better known as Galileo's metaphor that Nature speaks the language of mathematics).11 And much credit is due to studies in the mathematical foundations of measurement for making explicit and formally precise how this fundamental assumption, which begins with quantitative representability of basic attributes, forces enough qualita- tively uninterpretable conditions on TLM to make the concept length , contrary to Carnap, "theoretical" in any application , from the most pedestrian to the most esoteric ones. 10 Carnap's embrace of all basic quantitative concepts as theoretical has been overlooked (or neglected) by numerous commentators, often with embarrassing consequences. One exam- ple is F. Suppe (1989) who motivates his lengthy discussion of Carnap by the great importan- ce of rejecting Carnap's views "for the right reasons" (1989, 38). Yet, without so much as men- tioning Carnap's shift from observation to measurement, Suppe continues to hold Carnap to his earlier views on observation in science and, as a result, produces a paradigmatic example of misplaced criticism (Suppe 1989, 55-62) of the kind of theoretical-observational distinction which Carnap himself had explicitly abandoned. 11 It is truly regrettable, I think, that this assumption, so central to science and so rich with still poorly understood ontological and epistemological implications (see, e.g., Mickens 1990, Agazzi and Darvas 1997) has received so little attention from philosophers of science when compared with the attention lavished on such perennial favorites as the theoretical-obser- vational distinction.</page><page sequence="17">Measurement in Carnap 's late philosophy of science 103 5. Measurement and Carnap 's account of theory acceptance That length and other basic attributes in science come in harness with (usu- ally implicit) theories of measurement is a very bad news for Carnap' s empiri- cist approach to "confirmation" of theories, and, as a result, for his empiricist account of theory acceptance (1966, 20-21). 12 The reason is that the acceptance of Tlu cannot rest entirely on its confirmation by (agreement with) qualitative manipulations of objects in the world. After all, with some 'laws' of TLM, our qualitative judgments either contradict these 'laws' (e.g., non-transitive quali- tative comparison judgments of relative length discussed earlier) or are ab- solutely incapable of confirming or disconfirming these 'laws'. (E.g., we can neither qualitatively confirm nor disconfirm the numerically meaningful 'law' asserting that the operation © is increasing, i.e., Length(x) &lt; Length (x®y) for all x,y in D. The reason is that we have no way of qualitatively constructing and comparing two distinct rods one of which contains the other as a part). On Car- nap's "confirmation" account of theory acceptance, however, laws of the first kind must be rejected or revised, while our acceptance of the latter kind of laws is downright inexplicable unless, of course, Carnap can legitimately character- ize the laws of TLM either as conventions or as analyticity postulates which spec- ify only "meaning relations between certain words" (1966, 261) but "do not tell anything about the actual world" (1966, 263). 13 In the remaining part of this section I will explain why neither of these two options is available to Carnap. 12 Since Carnap never completed his project of reconstructing the informal notion of confirmation in terms of a formal notion of "logical (inductive) probability", I will not discuss this project here. (See Hilpinen 1975 for a comprehensive review.) But Carnap's optimism (1966, 35) that, ultimately, assignments of "degree of logical probability (confirmation)" will be shown to be "analytic" deserves a brief comment. From a mathematical point of view, a probability measure is just a real- valued function from some structured set (e.g., propositions of a formal language) into the [0,1] interval of reals satisfying certain conditions (such as Kolmogorov axioms for probability calculus). However, if this function is to have any non-mathematical meaning (e.g., as a measure of degree of con- firmation), its domain must be given some non-mathematical interpretation. One example of such an interpretation is that of a collection of propositions ordered by an agent's confidence (Carnap's "credence") judgments, e.g., 'p is at most as probable as q' Yet although it is a logi- cal ('analytic') fact (established by a representation theorem) that a certain structure on a domain is equivalent to the existence of a probability measure on that domain, there is nothing 'logical' about the question of whether the desired non-mathematical interpretation of that domain has the said structure - e.g., whether human confidence judgments indeed impose the required structure on propositions. And all proposed interpretations of quantitative probability (subjectivist, frequentisi, modal, etc.) involve assumptions about the world (or about human psychology) that go beyond what can be justified solely on the basis of qualitative interactions with the world (Batitsky 1998a, 63). 13 For the present purposes, I simply grant Carnap the analytic-synthetic distinction. For my aim is to show that even with this distinction granted, Carnap still cannot account for our acceptance of measurement theories for basic attributes.</page><page sequence="18">104 Vadim Batitsky Beginning with the 'convention' option, I have mentioned in Section 4 a number of ways in which TLM can modified without giving up quantitative rep- resentability of length. So, with respect to such modifications, our acceptance of any particular formulation of this theory is indeed a matter of convention.14 What is not a matter of convention, however, is our insistence that all accept- able versions of TLM impose on the associated physical relations/operations some minimal structural properties required for representing length in a cal- culationally efficient mathematical structure. More specifically, from the earlier discussion of theory testing we already know that any version of TLM which does not embody necessary and sufficient conditions for a (calculationally efficient) numerical representation of length is not a scientifically viable alternative. So, with that in mind, it is easy to see that our attribution of certain properties to physical relations/operations in- volved in length measurement is no more a matter of convention that our ac- ceptance of gravity is a matter of convention. Carnap himself acknowledged this much (in his remarks on the non-conventional aspects of rules of meas- urement) by pointing out that comparative relations specified by rules of measurement have "a complicated structure . .. [which]. . . we are not free to reject or modify " (1966, 58, italics mine). Why not? Because rules of meas- urement tell us that assertions of the said physical relations, such as x^y, imply assertions of corresponding mathematical relations, such as Length(x) &lt; Length(y). As a result, a certain logical structure of physical relations in rules of measurement " must be accepted to avoid inconsistency" (1966, 68, italics mine). This leaves us with the question of whether TLM fits Carnap's description of analyticity postulates. Carnap, it seems, has thought so, as suggested by his brief discussion of the asymmetry of the relation 'warmer' as an example of an analyticity postulate which specifies only what is constitutive of the mean- ing of the term 'warmer': "[T]he asymmetric character of the relation 'warmer' is concerned solely with the meaning of the word as it is used in our language. It says nothing whatever about the nature of the world" (1966, 263, italics mine). The above remark, however, is certainly (albeit not obviously) false. If by 'warmer' Carnap means the physical comparison relation 'x is noticeably (ob- 14 We can also modify our quantitative representation of length, e.g., by replacing the real numbers with the rational numbers. However, such modifications, so long as they leave us with a scientifically useful, calculationally efficient quantitative structure, still will impose qua- litatively uninterpretable structural properties on the corresponding physical relations and ope- rations (Batitsky 1998a, 65-66).</page><page sequence="19">Measurement in Carnap 's late philosophy of science 105 servably, measurably) warmer than y']5, then the structural properties of this relation surely cannot be discovered by contemplating "the meaning of the word as it is used in our language". Instead, these properties are determined by physical limitations which the world imposes on our perceptual capacities and our measurement techniques (cf. Kyburg 1997, 385-386). What is worse, the comparison relation 'x is noticeably (measurably) warmer than y' is not representable by the numerical relation Temperature(x) &gt; Temperature(y). For while the compliment of the latter relation (i.e., &lt; on real numbers) is neces- sarily transitive, the compliment of the former (i.e., 4 x is not noticeably (meas- urably) warmer than /) is not. The reason, already discussed in Section 4, is that neither our senses nor our physical instruments have 'mathematically per- fect' (limitless) discrimination capacities to give such comparison relations 'mathematically perfect' transitivity. Another way in which we can understand 'warmer' in Carnap's example is as the relation 'x has a greater numerical temperature value than y' Thus understood, this comparison relation indeed has 'mathematically perfect' structural properties which fit Carnap's description of analyticity postulates. But the term whose meaning these postulates specify no longer denotes a phys- ical relation among objects in the world. Rather it denotes a mathematical re- lation on numbers (i.e., &gt; on numerical temperature values). And the structural properties of that relation, on Carnap's continuing commitment to logicism in mathematics, are logical truths (Carnap's L-truths) which are true solely "in virtue of [their logical ] form and of the meanings of logical terms occurring in [them]" (1966, 259). This, however, is clearly not what Carnap had in mind for the relation 'warmer', since his example of this relation's asymmetry was meant to illustrate how the notion of analyticity, expanded in light of Quine's (1951) criticisms, can account for those analytic truths (Carnap's A-truths) which are not logical truths (L-truths). (And, of course, none of the structural properties of physical relations/operations on objects in the world described by theories of measurement are described by logically valid sentences.) Thus, with structural properties of physical relations/operations in length measurement fitting neither of Carnap's two kinds of analyticity postulates (A- truths and L-truths), the 'analyticity' option for justifying our acceptance of Tlm is also not available to Carnap. As a result, our acceptance of this and other theories of measurement remains inexplicable in Carnap's final, measurement- based interpretation of science. 15 Carnap (1966, 258) does, after all, describe 'warmer' as an "observational term".</page><page sequence="20">106 Vadim Batitsky 6. Concluding Remarks Thus far I have discussed Carnap's measurement-based interpretation of science and the reasons why measurement (and, more generally, quantitative theories) pose an insuperable problem for his empiricist approach to theory- world relations and theory acceptance. Because measurement is such an epis- temologically and methodologically crucial part of science, it seems fitting to conclude with a few constructive remarks on what I see as a lesson to be learned from Carnap's difficulties with integrating measurement into his em- piricist philosophy of science. The lesson I have in mind is an approach to the- ories of measurement which, while incompatible with the epistemological constraints of Carnap's empiricism, is strongly suggested by our commitment to quantitative representability of physical attributes. What I hope has emerged from the preceding discussion is that our commit- ment to quantitative representability of physical attributes demands that the phys- ical relations/operations involved in measurements of these attributes be inter- preted 'realistically'. Namely, as certain physical but mathematically represen- table relations/operations which transcend ( cannot be reduced to) mere qualita- tive interactions with the world. For consider again the qualitatively uninter- pretable (and, hence, for Carnap, "non-empirical") properties of physical rela- tions/operations required for adequate numerical representation of length. Despite the empirically problematic status of these properties, we have never felt compelled to weaken, let alone abandon, our insistence on (calculationally effi- cient) quantitative representability of length. Instead, we not only accept TLU without full qualitative interpretability, but we are also prepared to shelter this theory from some 'disconfirming' qualitative judgments (e.g., those yielding fail- ures of transitivity for relative length) by dismissing these judgments as errors. What such measurement-error judgments indicate, however, is that we indeed harbor some sort of a 'realist' distinction between 'real length' (as a certain phys- ical attribute representable in a certain quantitative structure) and 'measured length' (as a related physical attribute which may not always satisfy the condi- tions of quantitative representability).16 After all, if our most accurate (and faith- fully carried out) measurement procedures will yield nontransitive judgments of relative length, we will dismiss such judgments as errors not on the basis of other 16 Kyburg, who has long advocated a 'realistic' approach to measurement for many simi- lar reasons (1969, 1984, 1997), rightly points out (1984, 9) that we would not have retained TLM if it disagreed with all or even with most judgments about 'measured length*. What is impor- tant for the present discussion, however, is that we allow TLM to disagree with some judgments about 'measured length', and this is enough to show that our acceptance of this theory is not ent- irely a posteriori, contrary to Carnap's empiricist conception of theory acceptance.</page><page sequence="21">Measurement in Carnap 's late philosophy of science 107 measurements (since none can be more accurate than the best we have at a given time), but because these judgments will contradict the properties of 'real length' described by TLM . And so long as we maintain this much of epistemological and methodological protectionism toward physical relations and operations described by TLM , only a 'realist' interpretation of these relations and operations along the lines suggested above (see also Batitsky 1998a, 66-69) will do justice to the epis- temological and methodological status of measurement in science. From a more general perspective, the ultimate source of Carnap's problem with measurement is the earlier mentioned (Section 4) fundamental assump- tion of mathematical representability of the physical world. With so much sci- entific theorizing consisting of quantitative modeling of the world, there is no meaningful way of testing such models without a prior commitment to the ad- equacy of our quantitative representations of physical attributes whose numer- ical values we must enter as parameters into the theory's equations. Yet this commitment, even in the case of such basic attributes as length, requires us to impute to the world certain structural features that cannot be justified solely on the basis of observing qualitative relations and performing qualitative opera- tions. As a result, much of our scientific theorizing turns out to rest on a com- mitment which transcends our perceptual interactions with the world (Carnap's "qualities that we observe") and, thus, goes beyond anything that Carnap and other empiricists can be justified in believing.
