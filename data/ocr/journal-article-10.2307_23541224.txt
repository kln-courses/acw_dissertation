<plain_text><page sequence="1">QUEER EPISTEMOLOGIES: THEORIZING THE SELF FROM A WRITERLY PLACE CALLED HOME E. PATRICK JOHNSON Writing is the means by which I have always theorized my life. As a queer teen trying to come to terms with my sexuality, overweight body, and work ing class social status, keeping a journal and writing poetry were my life buoys in what was otherwise a sea of despair. My journals and poems were a way to express my rage on the page in ways that I could not in face-to-face encoun ters with my detractors, to chronicle my life experiences, and to validate my non-normative identity. The act of writing existed for me not only as valida tion and expression, but also as a self-reflexive mirror to see an image of my self that I did not or could not see in the eyes of others. The "I" and the "eye" were in dialogic tension. As Sidonie Smith and Julia Watson argue about women's self-represen tation, I use writing as a "performative act. . . that constitutes subjectivity in the interplay of memory, experience, identity, embodiment, and agency" (4). This interplay is made manifest through performance, the site at which the practice of everyday life is framed and named as extraordinary in a moment of cultural reflexivity. Indeed, conceptualizing life writing as performance not only provides a way to establish one's authority as a subject, it also situates "the body in some kind of material surround that functions as a theater of embodied self-representation" (Smith and Watson 5). As embodiment is a key component of performance, writing as performance—and life writing in particular—becomes a part of the epistemological loop of self: a way of know ing the self as other and the self as same. "You think you know something, but theory leads you to know it again," D. Soyini Madison writes: "You were always aware of power, beauty, pain, language, race, and yourself. But theory circles you back to all of them, including yourself" (109; emphasis in origi nal). The way Madison describes theory as circling back is related to the re flective and reflexive nature of performance, which requires that you know Biography 34.3 (Summer 2011) © Biographical Research Center</page><page sequence="2">430 Biography 34.3 (Summer 2011) something again, that "you feel and see differently. You speak differently and more. The recognition is not unrecognized" (109). Thus, from writing about my youngest days as a child growing up in the South to my experiences as a scholar/artist in the academy, I have come to understand writing and perfor mance as epistemological sites, as productive ways of understanding quotid ian forms of knowledge production. I perform and witness performance to know more about myself and about the other. And yet, performance theory, especially the concept of performativity or the discursive conventions that frame behaviors and events as performance, also resist narrative closure in relation to a knowable "I." Sidonie Smith ar gues that "There is no essential, original, coherent autobiographical self be fore the moment of self-narrating. Nor is the autobiographical self expres sive in the sense that it is the manifestation of an interiority that is somehow ontologically whole, seamless, and 'true.' For the self is not a documentary repository of all experiential history" (108). For some Smith's argument may appear to run counter to my claims of epistemological selfhood. On the con trary, my sense of self was and is affirmed through the very performativity of self-portraiture because each iteration of my "self" is always in relation to who "I" am in any given moment in my life history. Thinking of life writing in these terms allows us to take into account its spatial and temporal implica tions, which performance so elegantly highlights. As an adult, for example, I may recast my verbal repartee with a bully on the playground in a way that amplifies my agency. Life writing on this occasion gives me an opportunity to construct a self that exists somewhere between then and now, but it is not necessarily the self on the playground that I embodied in that moment; rath er, the autobiographical act allows me "to produce multiple, widely divergent stories from one experiential history" (Smith and Watson 11). The interanimation of life writing and performance theory culminates in a recent methodological turn in performance studies: performative writing, which according to Delia Pollock, has six "excursions" that define it as evoca tive, métonymie, subjective, nervous, citational, and consequential (80-96). While all of these defining characteristics are apropos to performative writ ing in general, I find that the two excursions that best describe my own writ ing are evocative and subjective. By evocative Pollock means that it "evokes worlds that are other-wise intangible, unlocatable: worlds of memory, plea sure, sensation, imagination, affect, and in-sight" (80). When engaging writ ing as performance, then, I draw upon the felt-sensing of memory to create a narrative of self as refracted through my own eyes, "to create what is self evidently a version of what was, what is, and/or what might be" (80; empha sis in original). The focus on evocation enjoins the reader in the meaning</page><page sequence="3">Johnson, Queer Epistemologies 431 making process, creating a dialogic/dialectic interplay between the writer and the reader relative to the narrative's content. Imagination and creativity are privileged over veracity and exegesis. Marlene Kadar's characterization of life writing as a critical practice is also true of performative writing, which "en courages . . . the reader to develop and foster his/her own self/consciousness in order to . . . humanize and make less abstract. . . the self-in-the-writing" (12). This does not mean that performative writing tips the scale in the di rection of "fiction," but rather "collapses distinctions by which creative and critical writing are typically isolated" (Pollock 80). I also believe my engagement with performative writing is subjective. Pollock suggests that "subjectivity [is] the performed relation between or among subjects, the dynamic engagement of a contingent and contiguous (rather than continuous) relation between the writer and his/her subjects(s), subject-selves, and/or reader(s)" (86). My multiple selves inhabit my writ ing—not just in the sense of multiple identities, but also in the sense of writ ing from the perspective of whom I imagine others to be. For instance, when I write in my mother's voice, it is not constitutive of who my mother is or what she actually said, but rather who she is as parroted through my rep resentation of her through language. "Reported speech," Deborah Tannen argues, "is as much a creative act as is the creation of dialogue in fiction and drama" (101). Consequently, the reader only knows my mother through my textual performance of her and the words I attribute to her, a characteriza tion that is "true" only in the sense that it is the way I re-member her in a particular time and space. Through evocation and subjectivity, performative writing offers a criti cal, yet playful way to crack open the possibilities of identity formation. It calls attention to identity as process, while at the same time it is grounded in the material reality of my life experiences. In this way, performative writing "helps me live a truth [and also] helps me name it" (Madison 109). What follows below then, is a performative meditation on sexuality, race, gender, and class as a way to engage the "physical realities" of my own life, an "excur sion" into life as lived, into me, the not me, and the "not not me" (Schech ner 110). BOOJHETTO LOGICS Red Kool-Aid is to cherry Kool-Aid as boojie is to bourgeois. They are one and the same; what you call it depends less on where you live and more on your state of mind. I grew up on red Kool-Aid and believed that red was the flavor until I was old enough to read the name on the package. Even then, I still</page><page sequence="4">432 Biography 34.3 (Summer 2011) referred ro it as red Kool-Aid because that's what everybody in the "hood" called it. But growing up in public housing (a.k.a., the "projects") necessitated that I be bi. . . lingual. At school amongst white folks, it was always "cherry." That was when I wanted to be bourgeois (boojie), as if my family had two nickels to rub together! Most times, however, I was boojhetto, that is, trying to be boojie while my ghetto roots almost always showed. And how could they not? I am the youngest of seven children raised by a single mother. Our first home was a three-room apartment in which my five brothers and sister slept in three beds crammed into the one bedroom, while my mother and I slept on a pullout sofa bed in the living room. 8th Avenue Drive was the street we lived on and it was one of the central streets in Ridge view, the all-black neighborhood in Hickory, NC, the town where I was born and raised. During my formative years in the late 1960s and early 1970s, my mother could not afford childcare, which meant she carried me with her to the Olsens, the white family for whom she worked as a domestic. On the sal ary she earned from that job she fed, clothed, and nurtured us seven children. And while Christmases were lean, she still managed to buy us gifts and we al ways had a tree—one of those fake trees made from aluminum and silver tin sel that came with a color wheel that was back lit by a light bulb that cast the colors onto the tree as the wheel rotated. I often got to help decorate the tree with a combination of red and gold bulbs and some painted wooden Christ mas figures like Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer, Frosty the Snowman, and Santa Claus that had been given to my grandmother by the white family that she worked for and who also were friends with the Olsens. The Olsens' posh three-bedroom home across the railroad tracks was filled with "things" that I was forbidden to touch. Their home was in stark contrast to our one-bedroom apartment in Ridgeview. While my brothers, other neighborhood kids, and I would make makeshift sleds out of refrig erator doors or whatever other things we found in abandoned apartments around our community, the Olsen children had real sleds. Our chotskies (called "knickknacks" and "whatnots" in my neighborhood) consisted of things like glass candleholders with pictures of MLK, JFK, and Jesus on them (the holy trinity amongst black folks of a certain generation), ashtrays for "decoration," and fake flowers in thick-cut glass vases. The Olsens, on the other hand, had antique figurines that had been passed down in their family for generations, and crystal vases that, to my young eyes, still looked like glass, filled with fresh cut flowers. Bottom line: our things and the Olsens' things looked the same to the undiscerning eye of a young boy—a queer young boy to boot!—because I did not have the cultural capital or "taste" (pace Bour dieu) to appreciate those distinctions. The concepts of "rich" and "poor"</page><page sequence="5">Johnson, Queer Epistemologies 433 were foreign to me, for my mother never discussed the Olsens or our family in those terms. All I knew is that the things we had at our home were "dif ferent" from theirs—and that many times my family was the beneficiary of some of the Olsens' things that they no longer wanted—televisions, clothes, kitchen appliances, toys, etc. It would be much later that I would come to realize that the Olsens were wealthy and that the goods they gave my family were their hand-me-downs. Even after coming into consciousness about our class status, however, I never felt materially deprived because of the ways in which my family and my community provided such a vibrant and "wealthy" cultural and creative environment. The black community in which I grew up prided itself on the fact that everyone in the community was considered "family," and that if someone was in need, it was a community issue rather than a personal one. This sense of community curtailed any angst I might have had about not having material things, and provided a foundation for the way in which I came to understand how race is an integral part of the epistemology of class. In other words, the black community in which I grew up taught me that be ing black in a racist society circumscribed one's access to material wealth, but it did not necessarily circumscribe one's access, participation in, and produc tion of cultural and intellectual wealth. While the housing projects we lived in were not as "hard" as those found in large northern cities like New York and Chicago, those who lived there had to develop "street smarts" to survive the deleterious conditions in which we found ourselves. This meant finding creative ways to access the material goods and knowledge we needed to exist or, in some cases, rise above our lot in life. Material poverty was eclipsed by the wealth of cultural knowledge. Part of that cultural knowledge was imparted through performance at the Ridgeview Community Center. It was not just a place where we played sports to give the false hope that that would be our ticket out of poverty (only one person from Hickory ever made it to professional basketball and that was short lived), it was also a place where we learned about the arts and literature. In her essay "Performance Practice as a Site of Opposition," cultural critic and feminist scholar bell hooks suggests that there are two modes of black performance—one ritualistic as a part of culture-building and one manipula tive out of necessity for survival in a oppressive world (210). hooks suggests that these two modes are not mutually exclusive but bound together in dia logic tension, given the way the skills endemic to black expressive culture are both required and deployed for ritual play and for resistive action, hooks of fers her own personal narrative about the importance the "live arts" played in her child rearing:</page><page sequence="6">434 Biography 34.3 (Summer 2011) Performance was important because it created a cultural context where black peo ple could transgress the boundaries of accepted speech, both in relationship to the dominant white culture, and to the decorum of African-American cultural mores. . . . Performance practice was one of the places where the boundaries created by the emphasis on proving that the black race was not uncivilized could be disrupted. Radical ideas could be expressed in this arena. Indeed, the roots of black perfor mative arts emerge from an early nineteenth century emphasis on oration and the recitation of poetry. In a number of narratives relating slave experience, African Americans cite learning to read and recite as crucial to their development of a lib eratory consciousness. (212) Like hooks, I, too, recall how three black women in my community—my play aunts—staged black plays and encouraged us children to memorize and recite the poetry of Paul Lawrence Dunbar, Countee Cullen, and Langston Hughes as a way to instill race pride and to counter the lack of exposure to black writers and artists in the public schools. This grassroots organizing speaks to the employment of the only resources available to the commu nity—orality. Without the political clout to demand a change in the city schools' curricula, these community leaders drew upon their indigenous ex pressive forms to transgress the white, bourgeois culturally sanctioned pro tocols of reading by making us memorize—and thereby corporeally experi ence—the literature privileged by black culture. The sustained privileging of literature outside the western canon coun tered the sole focus on white writers we poor black kids from across the tracks were forced to value in our newly desegregated schools. Our access and exposure to an alternative tradition equipped us with what Patricia Hill Collins in another context has called "specialized knowledge"—a knowledge that formed the basis for our particular "standpoint" (22). Therefore, I could easily counter my teachers' suggestion that Shakespeare's "Sonnet 16" is the pinnacle of literature by reciting Countee Cullen's "Yet Do I Marvel." Had not Mrs. Flossie Saddler, Mrs. Z. Ann Hoyle, and Mrs. Catherine Tucker— the women in my community who were black literary oracles—provided me with this "special knowledge," the trajectory of my educational career might have been drastically different. FOR COLORED BOYS While I understood that the divide between the haves and have-nots had a racial contour (there was only one white boy who lived in the projects with us), I didn't quite understand the significance of my own racial difference. My racial knowledge of self came to me in the form of trauma. I was never</page><page sequence="7">Johnson, Queer Epistemologies 435 hailed as a "nigger" or "coon," or the plethora of other names from the bigot's vocabulary; rather, I was called into being as "colored." Innocuous enough, I suppose, if it had been 1943—or even 1953. But this was 1973, the first year of desegregation in Hickory. Because someone in our town didn't get the memo that segregation was over or because they got it and lost it, my first grade class was the first of my generation to experience an integrated classroom. Our crayon box had several colors in it—I preferred "carnation pink"—but our world was literally one of black and white. The innocence of our tyke eyes inoculated us to the epider mal warfare being waged all around us. Color was just that—color. Signifiers, semiotics, and symbols be damned. Our Highlights magazines and Dick and Jane primers reflected the black-and-white images on their black-and-white pages that attached no meaning for us beyond an opportunity to add more vibrant colors to their pages with our crayons. Even back then in first grade at least the queens knew that everything needed a little splash of color, and especially some carnation pink! In this monochromatic schema of black and white, of course our teacher's name was Mrs. White—"Bunny" White to be exact. While it is true that the rabbits that I had seen up close and personal by that age had all been white with red eyes (albino rabbits were very popular science animals back then), Mrs. White was the only person I knew who was called by the same name as a pet. But I digress. Like her bright-eyed and bushy-tailed new students, Mrs. White was also naive about how integration would press her to the limits of what she considered a "liberal" constitution. In an article she published some twenty-three years after I was in her first grade class, she writes: "Patrick was one of four minority children in my class. I was soon to learn that young peo ple don't see color in their relationships. What a delightful discovery" (91). I find it ironic, then, that she was responsible for my "discovery" of color. One of the four "minority" children in that first grade class besides my self was my neighbor, Bryant, who was being raised by his grandmother, Mrs. Willie Rhea. Bryant was what the people in the neighborhood called "a bad ass chap"—chap meaning a child, but never in a good way (how this British lexicon made it to my poor black neighborhood I'll never know). One never wanted to be referred to as a chap—no matter how British it sounded. None theless, because we were the same age and lived next door to one another we played together at home, and when he wasn't terrorizing other students, at school. One day in Mrs. White's class we both wanted to play a record. I had experience with records because I had been gifted a Close 'N Play record play er for Christmas and Bryant had not. I was the expert at record playing and Bryant was not. Therefore, I should be the one to put the needle on the record</page><page sequence="8">436 Biography 34.3 (Summer 2011) and Bryant should not. Me? Selfish? No! A know-it-all maybe, but never self ish. This did not end well. Bryant and I began to play tug-of-war with the re cord and I got half and he got half. Seeing what we had done, Mrs. White ran over to us, snatched the pieces of the record out of our hands and yelled, "You two little colored boys!" Bryant and I had not seen color in our relationship, but now we did. Mrs. White's own whiteness came into sharp focus as Bry ant began to cry and I stood there searching the angry white face for answers to questions that it could not answer and would later deny were asked. So I went to the person who had all of the answers: my mother. I told her what had happened and asked her why Mrs. White had called me "colored," to which my mother replied, "Because you are." Voila! I materialized as if Scotty from Star Trek had beamed me up himself. My mother was not versed in Foucault or Butler at the time, but she imparted a postmodern explanation to me that I now recognize as a lecture on social constructionism, strategic essentialism, and of course black religious theology (a la Jesse Jackson): "Colored is what some white folks call black people to hurt them (finger pointing) . . . but that doesn't mean that you are any less than white people or anyone else (crying and unrecognizable phrases under the breath). . . . You gonna be somebody one day no matter what your skin color (chin cupping and head rubbing) . . . just put your trust in Cod and He will carry you through (moaning and rocking)." "/ was soon to learn that young people don't see color in their relationships." Whether she acknowledges it or not, Mrs. White made me see race on that day in 1973. On that day I came into racial knowledge—a recognition that came to me through a reprimand. I was smacked into blackness, as it were. To riff off of D. Soyini Madison's characterization of theory again, after be ing donned with "color," Ifelt and saw differently. I spoke differently and more. The recognition did not go unrecognized. Memory marks the mind's eye in ways that tell us the lies we need to get through the trauma of life. Mrs. White doesn't recall the record incident and was shocked to read about it for the first time in the last chapter of my book Appropriating Blackness. My recollection of the first grade incident tarnished her image of the little colored boy she remembered as "a beautiful child, hap py and gregarious" who "had a strong interest in music" (91). Mrs. White nurtured my interest in music by paying for piano lessons and buying me a clarinet for band. Despite my being "colored," then, she felt compelled to en courage the drive and creativity she saw in me at an early age. This is the part of the story where our memories converge, but the halo-effect of the happy memories is dimmed—colored-—by the uglier side of race knowledge and acknowledgment that sustains one person's willful denial of what I call her</page><page sequence="9">Johnson, Queer Epistemologies 437 benevolent racism, and the other's hateful embrace of his simultaneously re markable and unremarkable blackness. I acquired a new reading strategy that day that taught me how to discern the motivations behind the good deeds of white folk—a reading strategy that every little colored child must learn as a matter of survival. My reading of Mrs. White was confirmed in the words she wrote to me in the final section of the inscription in the book that contains her essay about her forty years in education: "I am proud of you and proud to know I touched your life at a formative age. Best Wishes and love, your 'white' mother. Bunny White, First Grade Teacher, 1973-1974." MISS QUEERNESS The holy trinity—race, class, and sexuality—are sacrosanct in academic dis course, and no less in my life. My social class and race fueled my queerness in ways unbeknownst to me. While my quotidian site of blackness was the first grade, my queerness circled and swirled about me like bees to honey until I finally fell head first into its centripetal force. In a nutshell, I became queer in the projects—or at least the projects became the training ground for my foray into "the life." It was in the projects where I absorbed the knowledge that my family, extended family, and community folk shared over meals at the dinner table, at the local barbershop, on the front porch, and at church. These social and cultural spaces and institutions taught me about politics, manners, and social etiquette, the "man," and (black) history—and about queerness. The first site was literally our home—the four-bedroom housing project we moved into when I was in the second grade in 1974. After having to share the pullout sofa with my mother in our one-bedroom apartment, I thought we had really "moved on up." But more importantly, I only had to share a room with one of my brothers because my sister and two eldest brothers had moved out on their own. Given the fact that I grew up the youngest of very masculine brothers who all played some sort of sport, one might find it hard to believe that queerness was in my home, but there Miss Queerness was—all up in the house. She first arrived in the form of my mother's wigs. My moth er first dressed me in a wig at the age of three as a form of amusement. She thought it was cute. But she didn't think it was so cute once I started sneak ing into her bedroom and putting the wig on my head for myself. There was something about the feel of all that curly hair on top of my head that freed me. My mother never had long straight wigs, ones I could have used to prac tice my "Icy Tina Turner" routines (that was my grandmother's vernacular pronunciation of "Ike and Tina Turner"). So, I made do with the curly afro, the asymmetrical bob, and the just plane ugly mullet that resembled the wigs</page><page sequence="10">438 Biography 34.3 (Summer 2011) worn by the forefathers of the country (see Figure 1). Before long, I was exper imenting with mama's lipstick, necklaces, and high heels. Her room became a playhouse for me to experiment and relish in my budding homosexuality. Now, I'm not trying to equate gender and sexuality. I'm much too smart for that now that Judy Butler and all the other queer theorists have taught me that it isn't so. All I'm saying is that at the early age of three, donning my mother's wig and later her lipstick, necklaces, earrings, and shoes became a precursor for my own gendered performances of a stylized femininity—my mother's femininity in particular. In some early photos of my mother for ex ample, she stands hand on hip, in a pose that would give Bette Davis a run for her money. I found similar photos of myself as a youngster, mimicking that same pose. Consciously or subconsciously, I had acquired my mother's "drag," donning her brand of femininity like a freshly laundered shawl, or perhaps something more bourgeois like a mink stole. Figure 1. EPJ, age 3, in his mother's wig (photo courtesy of the author).</page><page sequence="11">Johnson, Queer Epistemologies 439 Due to my socialization into (southern) black masculinity, I soon traded in the wig for a football helmet. (Those who know me are clutching their pearls right now, but please let me hold on to my queer card for just a little longer!) The helmet was, indeed, a poor substitute for the wigs. The only "joy" of playing football as a pre-teen was the fact that I got to see my other male friends naked. (I see the pearls are unclutched now!) We would often stand in the locker room and count how many pubic hairs we had. While conducting this comparison one afternoon, one of my friends told me, "You know if you fuck a girl with hairs [sic] you'll get hairs [sic]." Not very likely, I thought—on both counts. First, I was smart enough to know that only a good hair grease would make your hair grow because that's the lie I heard Mama tell all of the women whose hair she did in the kitchen, despite the fact that the very reason their hair wasn't growing was because Mama was frying it with a straightening comb. Second, I was not going to be fucking any girls— playing house with them maybe, but definitely not fucking them. My foray into sports didn't last long. It couldn't, for I was too much of an intellectual to engage in such "brutish" activities. In other words, I was a mama's boy. Unlike my brothers, I loved hanging out with my sister and my mother. And because I was so much younger than my brothers, they didn't want me hanging out with them, so by default I stayed around the house with my mother. I learned many things about the ways of the world by sit ting around the kitchen table listening to my mother and her friends gossip while they snapped beans, while my mother gave a press-and-curl, or baked cakes and pies. Sex was a part of the conversation on many occasions—espe cially when my Aunt Mary Lee, my mother's only sister, was visiting. Aunt Mary Lee loved to gossip and especially about who was doing what with whom and where. Aunt Mary Lee, like my mother, had a very high voice that pierced the air when she laughed. You could always hear her coming to the house because she wore an armful of bangles and bracelets. She loved her fat nephew. In fact, her nickname for me was "Pug" because she said I looked like one of those pug dogs—not a compliment, but endearing none theless (see Figure 2). When she walked in the door she would always greet me with a kiss and say, "Hey Pug. Auntie want you to run down to the store a little later, ok Baby?" which really meant me going to Bojangles Chicken to get her a three piece wing dinner. If she had her way, she would have had chicken wings ev ery day of the week—that and grape Kool-Aid sweetened to within an inch of a diabetic coma. She was about 4' 11" and seemed to be dressed up all the time—often in stiletto heels. When I knew she was coming over, I would make sure that I found something to do around the house so that I could catch up on the latest gossip. While Mama, in general, denounced gossip, she</page><page sequence="12">440 Biography 34.3 (Summer 2011) Figure 2. EPJ and his aunt, Marylee (photo courtesy of the author). always, interestingly enough, instigated Aunt Mary Lee's telling of it. Mama would start off with something like, "You know Beautie Mae is ho'in' around with Sweet Thang's youngest boy and plan on shackin' up down there on 8th Avenue Drive at her mama's old house. It's a scandal and shame." Aunt Mary Lee would perform surprise by saying, "Sarah, you better shut up! Girl, you lyin'," before coming in with her own zinger: "They better give that boy some Saltpeter before he get Beautie Mae pregnant. You know he done started smelling his pee." Busybody that I was, I looked up Saltpeter in the diction ary and for the life of me couldn't figure out why someone would give their child an ingredient found in gunpowder unless they were trying to kill them! Now, it took me a few years more to figure out what this latter phrase meant, but at that time I just thought it was a disgusting thing to even contemplate. And, furthermore, I couldn't imagine how one went about smelling his pee. Aunt Mary Lee would pick up an apple or some other fruit, take a bite and then look at Mama across the kitchen table, smack her lips and then drop</page><page sequence="13">Johnson, Queer Epistemologies 441 the gossip that she had come to tell in the first place: "They say that that last youngin' Beautie Mae had is John Ed's. Um hummm. I was lookin' at him the other day and he sho'll do look like him. But you know I also heard that John Ed is funny" I knew exactly what that meant! Inevitably, Mama would look up from whatever she was doing and shout, "Mary Lee! You ought not be saying stuff like that. That's how stuff get started. You don't know nothin' 'bout them peoples." Unfazed, Aunt Mary Lee would end the conversation with, "Well, Sarah, I'm just tellin' you what I heard. If it ain't true, it ain't true," and then roll her eyes. I would tingle inside from my ringside seat to the gossip. Aunt Mary Lee took pouring tea to another level, and became my skilled trainer in the intricacies of the art form. While Aunt Mary Lee trained me how to dish, my uncle Johnny taught me about genderqueer. Now, Uncle Johnny was a natural born player. I don't remember a time when he wasn't hitting on a woman—any woman: old, young, fat, skinny, dark skinned, light skinned, short, tall, toothless, etc. As long as she had female genitalia, he was interested. Uncle Johnny called all of his nieces and nephews by their first names followed by "Baby Doll," re gardless of gender. So, he always greeted me with, "How you doin' Pat, Baby Doll?" I always found this strange, but also cool because my older brothers hated when he added "Baby Doll" to their names. I'm sure it was his way of infantilizing us all, but I found it cool nonetheless. Uncle Johnny was always taking pictures with a Polaroid camera. He had trash bags full of pictures that he had taken over the years, mostly of women that he had met at the barbershop where he hung out after work and on the weekends. One day my mother asked him to bring to the house some of the pictures he had taken so that she could go through them to find ones of past family reunions. She was going to make a collage for our upcoming reunion. Uncle Johnny arrived with two trash bags of pictures and dumped them onto the kitchen table. Mama, my sister, Pam, Aunt Mary Lee, Uncle Johnny, and I sat around the table looking through the pictures. The num ber of pictures of women was mind-boggling. Some I recognized, while oth ers I had never seen before in my life. I was horrified to even find pictures of some of my high school classmates in some of the pictures. Gross, I thought. Uncle Johnny rummaged through some of the pictures as well, and would provide commentary along the way: "That's Bertha. She only had one breast, bless her heart." "Do you know Betty? Good God Almighty that woman had a hind end on her." "Pat, ain't that one of your little running buddies? I told her mama she can ride in my car anytime." Uncle Johnny was incorrigible on purpose. Aunt Mary Lee stumbled across a picture of Uncle Johnny with a woman named Sylvia who most folks in the community believed to be a</page><page sequence="14">442 Biography 34.3 (Summer 2011) lesbian. Instigator extraordinaire, Aunt Mary Lee turned to Uncle Johnny and asked, "Johnny, ain't this a picture of Sylvia?" Uncle Johnny took the picture from her, studied it for a minute, seemingly became lost in a reverie and began to grin a devilish grin before replying, "Yeah, that's Syp. You know she's half and half." I couldn't believe my ears. Mama pursed her lips and clutched her pearls disapprovingly, while Aunt Mary Lee snatched the photo from Uncle Johnny's hand and retorted, "Well, if she half and half, what were you doing with her?" Not to be undone, he coolly replied, "I was with the half I could be with." We howled. At that moment I realized that Uncle Johnny was the coolest and queerest dirty old man I have ever known. It would be my Grandmother Mary, however, who would teach me how to "read." Like many black grandmothers, mine was full of mother wit and advice, and was known to give you a good knock upside the head when you needed it. Grandmother's use of colorful language (e.g., "She gets on my nerves so bad it makes my ass want to cut stove wood"—who knew that asses were anthropomorphic!) was second only to her ability to size people up—in other words, to read people. She may have been illiterate in the literal sense of that word, but she could call a person out in a hot minute. In fact, my grandmother gave me my first lesson in gaydar. While visiting with her years ago, I sat with her on her front porch drink ing sweetened iced tea while she poured the tea about her neighbors. After a while, one neighbor, David, an elderly white man who had a soft voice, walked by and spoke to us. After he passed by, Grandmamma watched him as he made his way to his apartment. Satisfied that he had entered and closed the door, she said to me, "you know he's a quare." Now, admittedly, I had no idea what she was talking about at first and then came to understand that she was saying "queer," but in her black southern dialect it sounded like "quare." "Yeah, he's a homalsexual," she continued. "A what?" I asked. "You know, one of them homalsexuals." "Well, how do you know the man's a homosexual, Grandma?" "Well, he gardens, keeps a clean house, and bakes pies." Given that I too did all three of these activities but was not out to her, Grandmamma was reading me too. Before she passed away, she continued to read me. I remember speaking with her over the phone about a year after I moved to Chicago. I had moved to Chicago with my partner, Stephen, who my grandmother only knew as my "roommate." During the very brief conversation (old black folk don't do long distance) she only asked me three questions: "Pat, honey, how you doing?" "How's your roommate?" "Does he have a job?" After I replied positively to her inquiries she was ready to get off the phone. She knew and I knew that I had been read. But more to the point, she had gotten the information that</page><page sequence="15">Johnson, Queer Epistemologies 443 she needed to feel ok with my "roommate." I was happy. He was happy. He had a job. Enough said. My lessons in how to be queer didn't just come from my family mem bers or occur only in my house. The community provided pedagogies of the same gender loving kind as well. For instance, we had several "models" in our neighborhood—over-the-top queens who gave greater femme perfor mance. These "girls" would use the street as their imaginary runway as they sashayed and twirled down South Center Street, smacking gum, throwing shade, and reading those who dared to toss a homophobic remark their way, which was something that rarely happened—at least in earshot, for haters would surely get beat down. These queens were fierce. And while I had not come into my own (homo) sexuality back then, I both admired and hated their self-confidence in who and what they were. It would be some twenty years later before I would fully embrace that kind of self-love or come close to working a runway the way they did. Rest assured, however, that when my inner queen emerged, she emerged in full affect as Miss Shenita Bath, the dirtiest drag queen of the South. She and her sisters, Unita and Wenita Bath, debuted their first hit single, "Ring Around the Tub" in 1997. Though re tired for several years now, Shenita occasionally makes appearances around the world. *1 IP# Figure 3. EPJ as "Miss Shenita Bath" (photo by Stephen J.

My mother dragged me to church every Sunday the Lord sent. And believe me, I got tired of Him sending them. Like most of the folk in my community, we were Baptists. I remember the first time I saw someone "get happy." It scared me to death. And because I was an inquisitive child, I would often ask my mother why people were jerking their bodies, waving their hands, and danc ing in the church. Without looking down at me she would pat me on the leg and say, "Shhh. They feelin' the spirit." Her explanation meant very little to me, but folks "felt the spirit" so often that I began to accept it as a part of church service. Unlike some of the churches in the South where the pastor gay-bashed from the pulpit, my pastor never did. In fact, in all of the years that I at tended Morning Star First Baptist church-—"the church where everybody is somebody is Jesus is Lord"—I cannot remember the pastor ever preaching a homophobic sermon or even mentioning homosexuality at all. Church was genuinely a fun and nurturing place for all of us budding sissies, especially for those of us who sang in the choir. For many years, the choir was my saving grace. It was in the choir where I felt free to express myself and where I felt appreciated. At times I would catch the spirit, especially during my solos, and step down out of the choir stand and twirl down the aisle—all the while holding a note or doing a run and making sure no one took the microphone out of my hand. The little queen was begging to show out and I had a captive audience. By the time I was twelve, I had garnered quite a reputation for myself as "the little fat boy with the high butt and high voice that could sing." (Besides my voice, my ass was my signature. My ass was so big and so high when I was a kid that I could literally reach over my shoulder and get my wallet out of my back pocket. I looked like the letter "b" that first graders make when they are learning to write: a vertical line with a circle drawn in the middle of it and to the right.) I was the only male soprano and I could outsing any of the girls in the so prano section. I was this fat, boy soprano with a big butt and big voice who got the church to shoutin' every Sunday by singing the solo originally sung by Yolanda Adams with the Southeastern Inspiration Choir out of Houston, Texas. The song is called "My Liberty"—how prophetic (see Figure 4). Although folks marveled at my soaring melismas, as I got older, I was teased about my high voice. When I reached fifteen and was still singing so prano . .. well, let's just say it seemed a little "quare." But the diva would not be dismissed, as I kept right on twirling in my robe and singing my soprano, until at age seventeen, much to my chagrin, my voice changed and I could no longer hit those high notes and Sherri Shade took over the solo to "My Liberty." Me? Bitter? Nooooooooooo. Heifer.</page><page sequence="17">Johnson, Queer Epistemologies 445 r Figure 4. EPJ singing in the soprano section of the children's choir. Photo courtesy of the author. These memories of the projects and of the South in general remind me that I have not "overcome" just because I live in a big city now. In fact, it was my southern black community in the projects that was the site of my com ing into knowledge about the world, the site of my first coming. It is because of those experiences that I can now honestly say, "I'm living my life like it's golden." And so are those queer brothers and sisters who remain in my com munity and others like it all over the South. During many of my trips down south to collect the stories of black gay men who were born, raised, and con tinue to live there, I was forced to confront some of my own biases about the South since leaving. Listening to their stories not only grounded me, it also took me back to places I have only visited in my distant memory. They were telling my story while narrating their own—stories that take me back to first grade, the football team, Mama's bedroom, the kitchen table, Aunt Mary Lee's laughter, Uncle Johnny's cunning, Grandmamma's front porch, and the choir stand. They help me write my way "home."</page><page sequence="18">446 Biography 34.3 (Summer 2011) WORKS CITED Bourdieu, Pierre. Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste.
