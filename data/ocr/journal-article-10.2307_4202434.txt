<plain_text><page sequence="1">MASARYK AS PHILOSOPHER. i. The General Outline of Masaryk's Philosophical Personality. PRESIDENT MASARYK will hardly have the doubtful honour of parading among the philosophers who have erected new and complete systems. An exposition of his philosophy will scarcely take up many pages in the history of philosophical thought- unless of course the present estimation of great thinkers changes. Masaryk has given no system of philosophy such as those of Spinoza, Leibniz, Fichte, Hegel or Schelling (who indeed pro- duced three systems). Is this weakness or failure ? Certainly not. A philosophical system was the ideal of the rationalist and romantic thinkers, and Masaryk is neither of these. In the majority of philosophical systems, besides their inconsistency, which as a rule only becomes clear to later generations, their emptiness is striking. Their self-sufficiency is greater than their actual enlightenment. One often looks to them in vain for answers to the burning questions of the day, such as life and practical needs demand. Others must come after them to mint them into the current coin of living wisdom. Masaryk, as a philosopher, worked quite otherwise. If we look for unity in his work, we must seek it in the personality and the basic prin- ciples of the author himself. That personality was mature very early, and although it is obviously possible to trace develop- ment in his philosophical views, there are nevertheless no sudden breaks, crises or unaccountable changes. Even where he grew and changed, he was continually stopping to take his bearings. He does not belong to that type of thinkers whose work emerges from opaque depths, appearing in their consciousness as if by sudden revelation. If one is bent on claiming such intuition as a sign of genius, then Masaryk is no genius. Whatever he accomplished, he has done it with a full and clear consciousness. But just for this reason he never went backwards. He was called an intellectual, a man too logical and professorial, and it cannot be denied that at first glance rationality stands out in his work and in his personal contacts. But we must be very careful not to treat this as onesidedness. He assuredly is not to be numbered with those impoverished beings in whom reason 478</page><page sequence="2">MASARYK AS PHILOSOPHER. 479 obstructs the emotions and the will. His will is proverbial, his actions swift and persistent. And only those who do not know his writings, particularly his Humanitarian Ideals and his articles on " Modern Man and Religion " can speak of his lack of feeling. But for the most part we must infer his emotions from his deeds. His impulsive Slovak temperament is subdued by a powerful scholarly mind; his feelings are deep and unswerving. The demand that one should make everything clear to oneself was a demand that Masaryk always made upon himself and others. It is true that there are many questions so transcendent or so complex that this goal must remain unattainable: but we cannot fail to see clearly why it is so. Masaryk stands firm. According to him we may not throw away a weapon either in discourage- ment or prematurely. This is the root of Masaryk's struggle against mysticism and against what he generally calls myth. " Mystics are celebrated everywhere in the Church," we read in his Chicago lectures. " What is mysticism ? " All in all, it is an attempt, without logic, without experience, to obtain at one stroke all truth, especially all religious truth . . . the mystic is not an observing man; he does not believe that one may attain truth by logic or experience; he has visions, and imagines that he has the inner light and that he is in direct contact with God. This is true not only of Christian mystics. There is a long list of related tendencies outside the Church: spiritualism, theosophy, anthro- posophy, etc. Those amazing experiences which spiritualist mediums have in a state of trance, or the ancient "secret" traditions of the East, on which the occultist sciences are said to be founded, all those recipes for developing hidden, mysterious, supernatural forces in man, which reason only destroys as soon as it enters among them-all these were not only in conflict with Masaryk's spiritual make-up, but were always condemned by him as unhealthy manifestations. As a young man, during his study, in Leipzig Masaryk made a study of hypnotism under Professor Cermnak. He wanted to understand the morbid mentality on which spiritualism is based, and to clear up the supposed manifestations from beyond the grave. He published a lecture on hypnotism. A veryimportant element in his thought is his conception of myth. Not only the old tales of the creation, the fall of angels, or the heathen tales of gods and demons, but everything that is opposed to scientific thinking and scientific methods, is to Masaryk a myth. Every view which, however it may have</page><page sequence="3">480 THE SLAVONIC REVIEW. grown up, is passed on without question from generation to generation: everything which we are told not to investigate or think about. To him most systems of religious doctrine are mythology-even the larger part of Christian theology and apologetics which "pleads for extenuating circumstances." But there are also political myths (for example the divine right of kings) and social (e.g., the predestined subordination of certain people or certain classes), yes, myths even in science, as for example the doctrine that the raw struggle for exist- ence is the only mainspring of evolution in all forms of life, and that therefore the smaller nations should give way to the powerful. In a similar way Kant's " transcendental unity of apperception" has been called a myth by Masaryk. The chief battleground remains, of course, where science and critical philosophy stand against religious and theological traditions. It is for this reason that Masaryk has often experienced the hate of religious reactionaries. His controversies with the Catholic clergy in Austria at the beginning of this century have sometimes been dramatic in the extreme. And yet, Masaryk has always had a religion, not one which he accepted like a dispirited straggler, but his own; for his is a critical and creative spirit. It is positively pathetic that at the very moment when 309 Catholic clergy accused him of blasphemy, in order to undermine his public and private career, he was making the religious ques- tion the central problem of his whole thought. " The religious question is really the only one I know of," he declared in the articles already mentioned on " The Modern Man and Religion." It is for him the kernel of everything in life. 2. Theory and Practice. If the unity of Masaryk's philosophy lies in his personality, the system of his achievement is a system of work. There is no live question of the time to which he did not devote a pene- trating analysis, whether it be the question of modern psychoses and suicides, or the systematic organisation of sciences, social, literary or religious questions, the meaning of Czech history, moral questions of every kind, love and sex, monogamy and polygamy, alcoholism, morality in politics, the Spirit of Russia, the philosophy of democracy, the foundations of the New Europe, etc. He is a living witness that in a great man, theory and practice supplement each other, and that a sound theory is the most practical thing in the world. It is interesting to notice how Masaryk, even as a young man, made an effort to bridge</page><page sequence="4">MASARYK AS PHILOSOPHER. 48I over those vast distances which separate theoretical principles from their practical execution, let us say in politics. This may best be seen in the articles entitled " Theory and Practice " which he sent to the paper Moravska Orlice in I876. In these he started out from the then burning contemporary problem whether the Czech representatives should enter active politics in the Vienna Parliament; but in reality they were an exposition of his principles of sociology. The scope and reading which command the reader's admira- tion in his "Suicide," " The Social Question," or in his great work upon "The Spirit of Russia," were the result of much preparatory labour. Masaryk is not only a distinguished scholar *of languages and of all the civilisations of the white race, but at the same time a most systematic worker. His famous " pigeon-holes " are always full of extracts and notes, to which he consigns the results of his reading and observations. He keeps a regular diary. It really makes an overwhelming im- pression, to realise that he has an actual personal knowledge of the contents of his great library, or to find in quite recent English or American novels a short but thorough summary of the contents, in his handwriting on the cover. It is only possible for him to master all this material because his mode of life is so admirably regulated. No other life of a great man shows so clearly how, in this modern age, that which is great can only come as the result of petty and even menial labour. The close connection with life is evident in yet another way. Everything that Masaryk has written is equally connected with his own life: from it he drew his inspiration. He says he never wrote a line that he had not himself personally experienced. We can trace the incentive to his work on suicide right back to his childhood, and the impulses behind his " Social Question" are bound up with the hardships of his youth, when he was apprentice in a blacksmith's shop. Indeed, he did not need books in order -to acquire a social sense. The title of this article is somewhat narrow for what we -wish to describe. Masaryk the philosopher is inseparable from Masaryk the politician and sociologist. He was a most earnest student of society, its organisation, administration, diseases and needs. Sociology is to him the bond between philosophy and life, between theory and practice. Even the kitchen gave him food for thought. To him the value of philosophies is insepar- able from their repercussions in cultural life. The manner in which they work out in practice is the essential test. In this I I</page><page sequence="5">482 THE SLAVONIC REVIEW. he is somewhat reminiscent of William James; indeed he has. anticipated some of the leading ideas of Pragmatism. 3. The Purpose of Philosophy To Masaryk philosophy is not a science above sciences, as it was to the romantic thinkers in Germany. It does not have a special different method nor a particular source of knowledge. The only reliable investigation of truth is through methodical scientific work. Hence philosophy must be built up on special sciences of which it must have at least a general knowledge. The sciences give us fragments which are more or less narrowly defined and differentiated from each other by a wall over which it is difficult to see. But man needs something complete, he wishes to find his bearings in the world, in the universe, in the infinity of space and time; and this is what philosophy makes possible. It is " human omniscience "-limited, tentative, ever incomplete, because human. It must give direction to specialised work and enclose it within a suitable frame, though it may try to go still farther. These attempts, however, must be scientific. Such things lack the compelling character of mathematical truth which every sound mind is forced to recognise. They are only more or less probable. Philosophy thus becomes the totality of hypotheses, but at the same time it is the expression of person- ality. Even the most theoretic investigation of truth is bound to a moral condition-the love of truth. Unless the base is moral, science goes astray. Philosophy is necessary to individuals as well as to nations. It gives life a direction, it gives it unity, perhaps sometimes a false unity, but nevertheless a character. Hence Masaryk demanded of specialists in science, even in natural science, that they should try to realise the place and meaning of their special department in the wider sphere of culture, and also in the most recent philosophical perspectives. Masaryk's chief aim in philosophy is not how to think out complex ideas, but to know how to act. Therefore for him practical philosophy is the summit of everything. It is identical with scientific ethics, with a sociological bias. The theoretical principles of philosophy should also be the theoretical founda- tions of moral action. The convictions thus attained are always absolutely binding for his own life, and he demands the same of others. Those who attacked this as impractical, have had an opportunity in the past fifteen years of seeing that this is the very basis of the authority of Masaryk the statesman. For this very reason Masaryk has always been an enemy of</page><page sequence="6">MASARYK AS PHILOSOPHER. 483 decadent liberalism. Not of that healthy liberalism of HavliZek's type (his monograph on whom is one of his best books), but of that degenerate indifference which plays with ideas, yet takes none of them seriously and which after all is only another word for intellectual and moral laziness. He also rejects eclecticism, that is, the habit of choosing favourite morsels from various viewpoints, here a little there a little, but without a unifying spirit. Masaryk scorns the theory of a Treitschke that scholars and the common people should have a different education, and that we must give the common people a religious upbringing, whereas the scholars may remain free. He gives an absorbing description of such half cultivated, loose thinking in his essay on Garborg's " Weary Souls " (the first of his powerful series of articles entitled " Modern Man and Religion " in his review Nase Doba I896-97) and again in The Czech Question. He speaks very decidedly against comfortable thinking, epicureanism, against philosophy " a la minute," which is " the essence of superficiality and dilettantism in the worst meaning of the word." " By this pernicious selection we lose our personality and never attain totality or unity of view, so that in the funda- mental problems of life we fall under the sway of the thought of other people and even of other races." From the same motive Masaryk came out so relentlessly against patriotic lies, and that kind of pride which considers the dim past as more important than the misery of the present day. If he overthrew the well known Czech manuscript legend, it was because he could not bear a lie. And he quoted with pleasure the sentence of Havlicek: " One active and healthy Slav boy who may make something of himself is far dearer to me than all the Slav idols that have been dug up and will be dug up, that have been moulded and can be moulded." And we all remember his brave fight against the Macchiavellian policy of Count Aehrenthal in the Zagreb and Friedjung trials, when he entered the arena of world- history, never to leave it again. Another moral trait of his philosophy is his faith in the power of truth and the force of ideas-if we are men and stand for them bravely. Again and again in his writings occur comment- aries directed against a system of double truth. With his faith in the power and effectiveness of ideas he stood out against materialism of every kind, including the Marxist " historical materialism " of his Socialist friends, whose efforts for the rights of the working class he has always supported. In a speech to workmen he drew their attention to the fact that " ideas are</page><page sequence="7">484 THE SLAVONIC REVIEW. also realities." For, indeed, how can we liberate a class or a nation, if we do not improve their minds ? 4. The Problem of Metaphysics. Highly characteristic is Masaryk's attitude to the vexed question as to the possibility of a system of metaphysics. Origin- ally, he had simply put metaphysics on an equal footing with theoretical philosophy: but he does not like the name " meta- physics," which after all was due to an accident. The question of the limits of perception cannot be decided once for all on dogmatic lines: and this must especially be taken into account in religious matters. When one is engaged upon scientific work and admits an ever increasing range of questions into one's inquiry, this is clearly a case of extending the limits. Philosophy or metaphysics, as Masaryk contended round about the year I885, is the attempt, renewed ever and again and with new means and new knowledge, to set up an unitary outlook upon life (Weltanschauung). This must, as has been said, rest on the special sciences: a philosopher who is not a specialist in any single branch and has not thoroughly mastered any method, -will be of little worth. In other fields he must have an encyclo- -paedic knowledge of effects and problems. Masaryk himself, -then, is quite logically a type of the scholar who is informed in all directions. It is, however, inevitable that the philosopher cannot come forwardwith authority in most of the fieldswhich do not belong to his original scientific studies. On the other hand, scientific specialists are expected to remember their limits and not to claim that their methods and results are the sole road to salvation. Most of the aberrations of modern philosophy, such as materialism, naturalism, monism, are after all nothing but a struggle of certain sciences and methods, especially those concerned with mechan- ical processes, for exclusive sway. Masaryk classes them all as the product of an unscientific spirit, but at the same time tries to show the lines which true philosophy should follow. The way in which he did this has in many respects forestalled the present development of scientific philosophy. As early as the eighties- in other words, at a period when specialisation was in full swing -he appealed for synthetic work. It is but logical if he claims that success can only result from a thorough and well organised cooperation of many scholars. It is highly character- istic of Masaryk that he bases even theoretical philosophy upon cooperation, in other words upon democratic foundations. It</page><page sequence="8">MASARYK AS PHILOSOPHER. 485 is true that philosophers have always done this to some extent, for they read very widely: but they deal with the books which they read in far too individualistic a way. There is a lack of control over their work. Hence the young Masaryk proposed the formation of groups of scholars, who should corporatively restate " human knowledge " from time to time, and who should be willing to undertake a sifting of scientific results. Such a work would have involved remaking the educational system. There is, however, another condition which must be fulfilled, if metaphysical studies are to develop on harmonious and success- ful lines. An attempt must be made to define the natural order of sciences,-which in a historical sense may be said to have grown up wild-and to delimit their respective fields. This work Masaryk has himself done in a book published in I885 in Czech and Iwo years later in an enlarged German edition, under the title Versuch einer konkreten Logik. Roughly speaking, concrete logic means the teaching of method, and its main idea is the division of sciences into two sections, the one of mathematics and natural science, the other of sciences of the spirit. There is a further division into abstract and concrete, theoretical and practical sciences, and the so-called hierarchy, which determined their mutual relation and manner of serving each other. This task appeals so strongly to Masaryk that as an old man he again began to work at it on new lines, and is still working at it at the age of 8o. His last word in philosophy is likely to be a restatement of this theory. In all this the influence of Auguste Comte is very noticeable, and Masaryk has always shown a very high appreciation of this philosopher. Yet he disagrees with Comte almost all along the line. As is well known, Comte could not find any place for psy- chology despite the prominence which he gives to natural sciences and sociology. But Masaryk expects psychology to give far more results for metaphysics-that is, for synthetic philosophy- than most philosophers of the present day are inclined to expect: indeed their attitude is very largely determined by their struggle against " psychologism." But the psychology which Masaryk has in mind, is not merely physiological and causal, but descrip- tive and indicative, based upon mental data, thus following the lines of his Viennese teacher Franz Brentano. This man was one of the decisive influences on the life of Masaryk, who not only shared his love of scientific study and his high estimate of Comte, but also his combination of positivist methods with a definitely theistic creed. In short Masaryk is or is not a positivist, according</page><page sequence="9">486 THE SLAVONIC REVIEW. to whether the scientific methods of positivism or its rejection of religion are regarded as decisive. Masaryk did not adhere to his original view of placing meta- physics and philosophy on the same level. If in his Konkrete Logik he treated logic (including epistemology) and ethics as special sciences with a flavour of philosophy, he eventually changed his opinion to the extent of including them on an equal footing within the sphere of philosophy. He comes to regard theoretical knowledge as merely a part of our conception of the world and of life-a conception which is determined by life itself and presupposes high moral qualities. In a later Czech essay entitled Summary of Sociology, he very characteristically altered his system of the sciences in favour of theology, for which he had originally found no place. He now no longer believed in a " philosophical religion." The wide and noble realm of religion and a more profound study of Christianity led him to the conviction that these demand a special scientific treatment, coinciding with religious philosophy. It is remarkable that in his case this evolution belongs to a period full of dramatic conflicts with the clergy. If we survey the development of philosophy since the eighties, and above all the mass of important specialised work which has been produced since then, and if we consider the growing tend- ency of experts to combine and produce composite work, we must conclude that on the whole things are moving in the direc- tion of Masaryk's original programme. But this is connected with his attitude to most of the historical philosophies. In so far as these-for instance, the Aristotelian philosophy-do not, under the title of " first philosophy" (which afterwards came to be called metaphysics), advance hypotheses in natural science, and other spheres, and in so far as they claim to be really defin- itive systems, Masaryk does not value them very highly. This applies especially to the well-known systems of the post-Kant romanticists, Fichte, Schelling and Hegel, whose " airy " a priori methods he condemns. They strike him as thin and some- what lifeless, aristocratic and over-hasty. Even Kant he could not forgive for his distrust of the inductive sciences, by which he had brought philosophy into serious conflict with the scientific tendencies of the igth century, with most unfortunate results. In his work The Spirit of Russia, he reproaches the Russians for following Schelling and Hegel too closely and thus living politic- ally more in the air than on the earth. Masaryk is a philosophical realist; and his realism-in other</page><page sequence="10">MASARYK AS PHILOSOPHER. 487 words, the conviction that on the whole (though not entirely) *objects determine our knowledge of them-is carried by him a stage further, in the sense that virtually, though perhaps not in so many words, he recognises the divine order and regards the experiences based upon it as capable of scientific treatment. But even in philosophy there must in the end be belief: the only question is, in whom and in what we are to believe. The main thing is to have a thorough knowledge of reality. This may be an obstacle to synthetic work, but it preserves us from over-hasty conceptions. True to this conviction, Masaryk has for many years past been one of the best-informed thinkers. The ideal unity of philospher and politician has rarely been personified to so eminent a degree in any man. But the many struggles which he had to sustain and to which his biography bears witness, gave him the clear consciousness of their essential reality: we do not live a mere life of shadow, and the forces of evil are really at work. No deeper harmony is to be found among them: and those idealists are in error who surrender themselves to the conviction that the disgusts and paradoxes of this rough world are in reality merely due to our nebulous perceptions, to dispel which is the true task of philo- sophy. Not as though Masaryk were not a great practical idealist. But the philosophic idealism whose tendency is to gild over every- thing, is rather a philosophy of consolation than a foundation on which to conduct a strong and courageous struggle. And as regards the struggle itself, we have nothing in our pocket ; success is bound up with all too many conditions which must be fulfilled if we are to reduce the probability of defeat. Here one thinks involuntarily of William James and his pluralism. " Life is an adventure." In their theories of liberty also (Masaryk has a theory of creative determinism) the two thinkers, though entirely independent, have much in common. The reality is not vouch- safed once and for all, it is plastic, and we are called to be fellow- workers in the purposes of God. It would lead too far if we attempted to describe in detail Masaryk's attitude to the great philosophers and his criticisin of them. David Hume, Kant and Comte are especially prominent in his writings. Masaryk could not accept in its entirety Kant's criticism, which sought to refute the scepticism of Hume, and thus Hume again became a problem that exercised his mind. Already as a young man, in I883, he endeavoured to refute Hume's scepticism by a reference to the calculus of probability, and he always continued to devote great attention to this thinker</page><page sequence="11">488 THE SLAVONIC REVIEW. of genius and simplicity. His rejection of Kant he afterwards toned down; he found the complete Kant in the latter's prac- tical philosophy, and even though unable to accept the doctrine of the formal categorical imperative, he was attracted by the attempt to find an absolute basis for ethics-an aspiration which Masaryk has shared throughout life. His personalism separates him from Comte, and he severely criticised Herbert Spencer's philosophy of evolution, Schopenhauer's morbid philosophy and Henri Bergson's vague doctrine of intuition. But not alone the purely philosophical thinkers, but also, and perhaps to a higher degree, poets and prose writers, have provided him with problems. Musset, Garborg, Zola, Nietzsche, Goethe and others offer him many ideas which are at once trans- fused in his mind into philosophic problems of the day. His later writings are crowded with literary references. When during the Great War he began his grandiose political action for the liberation of his people, he studied not only the situation on the battlefields, and the diplomatic atmosphere, but above all the mentality of the peoples, from whose inward firmness alone victory was to be hoped. And this he found personified not so much in their philosophy, in the narrower sense of the word, as in their literatures. This attention to literature does not merely reveal a voracious reader. It is true that he is really always reading, and has an almost complete mastery of Czech, German, English, French, American and Russian literature. But there is something more behind this. His original high, and perhaps indeed exaggerated, estimate of scientific work, has changed in many respects. Already in the eighties, when he wrote a small essay on the study of poetry, he declared the true artist to be the greatest of all discoverers, since he is able to perceive as a comprehensive whole that which science only builds up painfully and in fragments. In the same way the fullness of religious life, so difficult to de- scribe, may be considered as a source of knowledge. With two of the really great thinkers, however, he has found himself throughout life in strong conflict. The one was Leo Tolstoy, with whom, despite all personal friendship, he never could agree. He met Tolstoy's evangelical principle, that evil is not to be resisted, with the very opposite theory, that we must always and unceasingly combat what is evil. The other was Dostoyevsky. Masaryk's plan for his great book, Russland and Europa (The Spirit of Russia) provided for a third section devoted to an analysis of Dostoyevsky, as a key to the deepest</page><page sequence="12">MASARYK AS PHILOSOPHER. 489 problems of Russia and of Europe. This still unfulfilled promise -perhaps the only one which is left for the President to fulfil- shows that Masaryk profoundly disagrees with Dostoyevsky. 5. Masaryk and Questions of the Day. Philosophy has never been to Masaryk an end in itself. For the same reason he has never produced any theory of ethics, though his views upon them are very clearly visible. All the more attention has he devoted, as a sociologist and as a practical man, to the burning questions of everyday life, in which outlook upon life and moral evil are so often interwoven with the struc- ture of society. Let us first take suicide, to the study of which Masaryk devoted his first great work: Der Selbstmord als soziale Massener- scheinung der Gegenwart (Suicide as a Social Mass Phenomenon of the Present Day). Masaryk discusses not only suicide in the narrower meaning of the word, the final act of violence, which a distracted individual, weary of life, commits against himself. Suicide in this sense is only the fruit that grows from deeper roots. Therefore Masaryk considers suicide in its wider meaning, by which he understands despair and despondency, even indiffer- ence to that which ruins and breaks a man, a lack of support in himself and in the world, a lack of faith in the divine order of the world. These are not only accompanying phenomena, but direct elements of suicide. All resignation and pessimism are unhealthy symptoms in contemporary society. In Suicide, on the basis of rich statistical material, Masaryk produced not only a detailed analysis of all the influences which increase the number of suicides, but tried to strike at the very root of the matter. He sees it first in that extreme subjectivity of the person with suicidal tendencies. " Suicide is a sort of delirium of subjectiveness, the destruction of personality as soon as it lets go an object on to which it could hold "-so he writes in Modern Man and Religion, where he deals with the question again. It is an illness of all civilised society, not only of the individual in question. Otherwise how could we explain the fact that it scarcely ever appears among primitive peoples ? How could we otherwise explain the fact that it is possible by statistics to foretell the number of suicides in a future period ? The roots are fixed in a decay of the " Weltanschauung." Our age is a period of transition. Faith in the authority of the teaching of the Church, and the hope based upon it for this and the future life, these are in a state of overthrow and are not yet replaced</page><page sequence="13">490 THE SLAVONIC REVIEW. by anything else. Philosophy, owing to the variety of its ten- dencies, could not strengthen the soul and give it firm support for a life of hardship. Just that desire to live, that selfish softening of modern man, forces him to leap into the darkness. Thus modern suicide is a real social question, and it is also the chief and greatest problem of modern literary thought. " Modern man wants to live and live, but just for this very reason he often gives himself to death. In the chase after bliss and pleasure, even death seems to him sweeter than the happiness which he has failed to grasp." Masaryk traces the suicidal, twisted, pessi- mistic, helplessly subjective mood, the decadence and other symptoms of decay which lead to these modern hecatombs. The names of Byron, Krasinski, Strindberg, Musset, Bourget, Baudelaire, Garborg, Przybyszewski, Zola appear in his pages. To lead the modern man out of this confusion, in which he wavers between belief and disbelief, defiance and weakness, titanism and humility, anarchy and submission, seeking satisfaction in all possible obscure paths of life, Masaryk suggests a remedy in a new, strong, active view of life. One must strive for something, have a goal, devote oneself to work; but that work must not be a mere drug, but must be conceived as a duty. It will be understood only when life is conceived sub specie a?ternitatis. At the same time Masaryk has throughout life been a critical but nevertheless loyal friend of one anti-religious movement, namely socialism. Yet his Social Question, one of the greatest and most thorough of his writings, is a continual polemic against the theoretical principles of the Marxist movement. Man is not what he eats, and his thoughts are not a mere reflection of the conditions of production. Our legal regulations, our morality and religion are not simply the reflection of a bourgeois social order, though they have been undoubtedly influenced and even maimed by it. There are not merely class moralities, but principles essentially independent of man and the classes into which he falls-principles in whose name even the founders of Socialism, perhaps subconsciously, came to revolt against the bourgeois society which had bred them. Masaryk points out that the Socialist movement, full of wrath against capitalism and the abuse of the means of production, and acting quite as much under the influence of this anger as in the hope for a better future-that this movement is a typical example of faith in ideas. They did not believe in the power of thought, yet they tried by the power of thought, of an Utopia, and of moral indignation, to overthrow the hated economic order. The very demand for equality and</page><page sequence="14">MASARYK AS PHILOSOPHER. 491 justice -is a humanitarian and ethical idea. This does not mean that a materialist is bad, any more than that his idealist and theological opponents are good. But he must be on the watch, lest his effort, which is in reality moral, be not weakened by doubtful theoretical principles. The Marxist theory of two, and only two, social classes, and of their class struggle, is a tactical primitivism. Marx made his social problem too narrow and schematised. Masaryk's view is far more comprehensive. There are other people who are socially weak besides the industrially oppressed: the old man, the invalid, the sick man, or perhaps the woman, are not these only too often socially weak ? Profiteering is an endlessly complicated problem. And is the economic weakness of the workman his only weakness ? What about his spiritual or cultural weakness ? The intelligent workman will possess entirely different powers of resistance. Is not the adult education of the Socialists infinitely better than their theory ? And faith-there is faith everywhere. It is true that Darwin's eagerly accepted theory of evolution strengthened the anti- religious bias of the movement. But it has also brought the belief in a better future, a faith which has at times acquired an -ardent, even messianic character. If religion is actually faith in the future, if it strengthens man by giving him hope in what is to come, then evolutionary doctrines certainly had much in common with it. People accepted them just as they used to accept faith in eternal life. In fact, the social question is thus one of the coming religion. The principle of the class war-as a dogma, not as a necessity of the time or as the slogan of an organisation-is anything but a programme. Masaryk was one of the first to write about the crisis of Marxism. The development of affairs has placed us before a really terrifying spectacle, brought about as a result of the materialistic principles of Capital; and we are compelled to ask, which of the two is right, Masaryk or Lenin ? The idea of humanity, the paramount ideal of Masaryk since about I890, is lacking in his writings previous to the Concrete Logic: but it will serve as a title for his whole programme. It summarises everything that alike in private, educational, practical and political life should lead to an earnest, full, generous humanity. Masaryk called his political theory " Realism," because before the war it was meant to be in opposition to all vague political phantasies. He might equally well have called it humanitarianism. Of course we are not concerned with the</page><page sequence="15">492 THE SLAVONIC REVIEW. term, but with the thing itself. And here we must say a few words also about the point of view expressed in his books on The Czech Question (I894), Jan Hus (i895), Karel Havlicek (I896), Let us organise ourselves for work (I897), etc. These formed the basis for Masaryk's small party before the war-a party which ceased to exist as such when the magnetic personality of its chief assumed the leadership of the whole nation. The Czech Question is an ethical and religious conception. In the introduction Masaryk refers to Providence which has ordained the place and purpose of the Czechs among the nations; our goal is to recognise and to realise this task properly. Masaryk finds this idea in the traditions which extend from Chelcicky' and the " Unitas Fratrum " through the history of the Czech national renaissance. With Dobrovsky and the poet Kollar this tradition is enriched by thoughts of humanity. In Palacky it assumes, especially in his political testament to the nation, the character of a lofty, even prophetic faith in the victory of the pure weapons of the spirit, in Havlficek it is transformed into a living, temperate, and at the same time progressive, political programme. With Augustin Smetana there comes a quality of social feeling. If we read The Czech Question, we are struck by the amount of historical material contained in it. Of course the issue was highly complicated, and many other forces were at work. Masaryk has indeed always been opposed by some historians who hold the view that history is merely cumulative, and on the whole has no special meaning. It has also been objected that Masaryk has simplified and schematised Czech history, and that many other quite different influences besides those of humanity or the traditions of the Bohemian Brethren played their part in it-for instance, the Catholic clergy, Masonry, romanticism, and so on. The question remains, whether Masaryk has defined his nation's purpose correctly, and whether the things he stressed were as vital as he claimed. The truth is that Masaryk has instinctively sought for his forerunners. His whole historical conception may be said to rest upon a valuation. Indeed, can there be such a thing as scientific history without valuations ? Is scientific history at all possible without an attempt to understand historical events ? Can it limit itself to descriptive narrative ? The Czech Question is a confession of faith. By our programmes and actions we certainly impart a meaning to history-indeed an endless series of thoughts full of meaning. What then will the historic whole be like ? Is it merely cumulative? Are there not in history</page><page sequence="16">MASARYK AS PHILOSOPHER. 493 laws which prove certain ideas to be healthier, stronger, more productive ? It is true that this cannot be absolutely proved from the past, though we are bound to believe in something of the kind: but the question is whether history offers an empiric basis for such a belief. With such ideas in his mind and such a faith in his heart, Masaryk was obviously no bad guide. As President, Masaryk is above all concerned to deepen his philosophy of democracy. The final chapters of his absorbing work The Making of a State contain his democratic confession. Democracy and leadership, the problem of authority in a democracy, the quantitative and qualitative estimate of de- mocracy, the problems of administration and self-government, the moral foundations and social implications of a democratic system-such are the questions which lie near to his heart. The whole evolution of Europe is from theocracy-that is, govern- ment by Divine Right-towards democracy: and this is the essence of the " World Revolution " which took place during and after the War. But democracy is by no means identical with the first uncertain steps which we have so far taken, and is not refuted by a reference to the childish diseases through which it is passing. Masaryk has dealt in a special essay with the difficulties confronting democracy. It is quite wrong-headed to combat democracy on grounds such as these. To Masaryk it far rather represents the ideal towards which we are moving and to which we can only approximate. Its quality can be continually renewed and strengthened, and prominent personalities will always find in it an increasingly free field of self-assertion and service. But it must rest on an international basis, for the interdependence of peoples is to-day so great and grows so quickly, that a narrowly patriotic nation- alism is only a drag upon progress. This is also true of internal policy in the state: for the petty egotism of small groups must yield to a world-wide outlook: and this is especially the case with small nations. Thus for Masaryk democracy is quite definitely the supreme political ideal. In it is concentrated all that he has earlier aimed at in his profound scientific studies, in his high estimate of personality and his humanitarian programme. 6. The Problem of Ethical Sanction and the Religious Question. Among his minor writings on ethical and social questions, such for instance as alcoholism, or monogamy and polygamy, especial prominence is due to one entitled Ideals of Humanity</page><page sequence="17">494 THE SLAVONIC REVIEW. (Ist edition, I9OI). In this attractively written essay he insists that he is not concerned to say anything new. " The riddles are old, and their answers also are old: and many of these old answers are sound and accurate. But they will only be right for us if we understand them in our own particular situation today. Then many things which we have often heard before, .acquire for us a new meaning. Thus we progress until we per- ceive a new meaning in what we already know, and new side- lights are thrown upon old experience." The main thing is our will, which is the outcome of personality. Masaryk's own writings are certainly an expression of his personality-notably his ideas on monogamy, which reflect his pure and lofty stan- dards and his deep love for his American wife, who remains a sacred memory for all Czechoslovaks. But his writings are no less interesting from the theoretical standpoint. A sharp critic of utilitarianism, despite all his admiration for Bentham and Mill, it is far rather to the ethical life that he looks for success and for a recognition of the divine education of mankind. " I cannot conceive the final solution of ethical problems without religion." Thus the problem of ethical sanction becomes the bridge which leads over from philo- sophy to his religious world. As regards religion, however, Masaryk has throughout life had to go through many a fight with himself. The old idea of a philosophical religion, which he put forward in his Concrete Logic, he has abandoned. But his powers seem to be unequal to describing what the religious life really is. We continually hear what religion is not-not dogma, not philosophy and science, not morality, not liturgy or attachment to a church. Though often, and sometimes of necessity, linked up with these things and leading up to them, it is in no way identical with them. But as to his " sanctissimum " Masaryk in general keeps silence. And yet it is noticeable that his powers are unequal to the task of description, only because it is a question of life, which after all defies description. Masaryk is a theist and a sworn enemy of pantheism and of all vague pantheistic mysticism. But how then is God to be imagined ? The annihilating criticism directed against anthropomorphism and sociomorphic conceptions of God leaves us without any material on which to base our view. Even conceptions-Masaryk declared in an address to Protestant theological students-are an offence against the commandment which forbids the making of images. The definite character of Theism lies neither in representations nor conceptions, but in</page><page sequence="18">MASARYK AS PHILOSOPHER. 495 the definiteness of the feelings and obligations which we feel towards God. Prayer as a request is not the main expression of piety. And indeed this great leader of political democracy has solved his own relations to God as synergism or co-operation, in other words on an essentially democratic basis-which has shocked many devout people and has often been regarded as a lack of reverence. Though, as we saw, he has included theology on principle among the sciences, Masaryk remained quite uncompromising towards those survivals of mythical teaching which are the main content of theology. He is in no sense of the term orthodox. But he has become Evangelical, though he was born a Catholic, and if he has never prayed to Christ, he declares in his Making of a State that " Jesus, not Caesar, is the meaning of history." For this man, who announced before the cynics of the Vienna Parliament that he had never for a second been an atheist, there is God, a divine Order and Providence. And there exists man, not as an apparent phenomenon, not like a chance wave on the ocean of inanimate Nature, but as a soul, independent to a certain degree, creating, evolving new realities in and by his ideals. He cooperates with God, certainly to a lesser degree than the tiny polyp on the coral island shares in the work of the ocean that surges around him, but still cooperates. For good or for evil, he may beautify or despoil God's world. This life is already part of eternity, for Masaryk believes in immor- tality. Hence we are to understand our duties, not as mystical visions or as playing with confused feelings, but as concrete tasks, national, social, human, in the family, in education, among friends, in politics. Patient, minute toil; social, intelli- gent, critical love, not a puppy love ; serving man whom we can see, we serve God whom we see not. Thus Masaryk is a captain who not only knows his map of the world and the currents of the human sea, but also bears in mind that it is safer in the deeps than in the shallows. He knows when and how to consult his compass-and the stars. In the words of F. X. Salda, the well-known Czech literary critic: " That is why everything is so suggestive. We feel the philo- sopher behind the philosophy, a creative spirit that observes, feels, thinks and assists, but for this very reason does not incor- porate his observations in a petrified system, but turns to other creative spirits and demands from them common thought and common work. His is a message from one life to another." University of Prague. J. B. KOZAK.</page></plain_text>
