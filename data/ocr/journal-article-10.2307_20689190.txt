<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES AND READINGS The Symbolic Sukkah in Psalms In the narrative books of the Hebrew Bible, the term sukkah refers to a small hut, or booth, which was built during harvest time and during its commemorative holiday, Sukkoth. Such huts were also used during military campaigns (1 Kings 20:12, 16) and at least once on a celebrated prophetic mission (Jon. 4:5). Stemming from a root meaning "to cover," the name sukkah describes the function of such huts as small covered places. But in the poetic books of the Hebrew Bible, each use of the covering sukkah is figurative. Studying these metaphors and metonymies discloses a great deal about the biblical literary imagination: its conventionality, its creativity, and most impor tantly, its bivalent approach to words, and through words, to the world. After surveying the range of metaphoric uses of the sukkah, this essay will focus on the image of the sukkah in Psalms, particularly in psalms of lament, where the biblical poets developed both a formulaic system and a free adaptation of the sukkah motif to characterize their ambivalent relationship to a hidden, but sheltering God.1 Our first metaphoric sukkah is political. In the final verses of Amos, after a bitter denunciation of the sins of the northern kingdom of Israel, the prophet consoles his audience with the promise that God will rebuild the fallen sukkah of David. The prophet follows with imagery of a fortified house; God will "mend its breaches," "set up its ruins anew," and "build it firm as in the days of old" (9:11). The contrast between the two house images is deliberate. The make-shift, temporary sukkah is an inappropriate image for a flourishing royal house, but an apt one for the breached kingdom to which Amos preaches. Isaiah plays on related connotations of the forlorn sukkah. The land of Judah has been laid waste, its cities burnt down, its produce consumed by occupying strangers. Against this dismal background, the prophet compares bat-tsiyyon, the feminine personification of Jerusalem, to a "booth (sukkah) in a vineyard," "a hut (melunah) in a cucumber field," and "a besieged city" (1:8). All three similes emphasize the solitariness of a dwelling place in the midst of surroundings not normally inhabited. Fair Zion has been left in this condition, powerless and abandoned. The concluding image of the pericope intensifies these negative associations: "Had not the Lord of Hosts left us some survivors / We should be like Sodom, another Gomorrah"(l:9). The second metaphoric use of sukkah in Isaiah utterly transforms the negativity of the image. The booth is envisioned as a celestial pavilion and takes its place in a theophanic vision: PROOFTEXTS 7 (1987): 259-267 ? 1987 by The Johns Hopkins University Press</page><page sequence="2">260 NOTES AND READINGS the Lord will create over the whole shrine and meeting-place of Mount Zion cloud by day and smoke with a glow of flaming fire by night. Indeed, over all the glory shall hang a canopy (huppah), which shall serve as a pavilion (sukkah) for shade from heat by day and for shelter and protection (mahsah and mistor) against drenching rain (4:5-6). The vision of God's glory invoked here, recalling the cloud that hovers over the Tent of Meeting in the wilderness (Num. 9:15-17), indicates that God ultimately chooses where God will dwell. Mount Zion can be seen as a solitary booth when God has departed from it, or as a permanent celestial abode when God chooses to favor it with his cloud. The two sukkah metaphors obviously complement one another, signalling that Zion, now desolate, can again become resplendent. The agricultural sukkah offers little shelter from the elements, but God's sukkah, the place covered by the divine presence, offers enduring protection for the people of Israel. We also find the bivalence of the sukkah image in the poetry of Job. It represents both the home of the wicked (27:18) and the celestial pavilion of God (36:29). The first image is Job's; the second, Elihu's. Discoursing about the certain destruction of the wicked and of his descendants, Job remarks: "The house he built is like a bird's nest, / Like the booth (sukkah) a watchman makes." In the next line he tells us that the rich man lies down with his wealth intact, but wakes to discover it is gone. From this juxtaposition, we infer that it is the sukkah's flimsiness that makes it the appropriate metaphor for the doomed house of the wicked. As a metaphor for the house of God, the sukkah in Elihu's speech testifies, by contrast, to God's incommensurable power. Rather than protecting the people from rain, as did the celestial sukkah in Isaiah, this one is itself the source of rain, thunder, and lightning. "Can one indeed contemplate the expanse of clouds, / The thunderings from his pavilion (sukkah)? I Behold, he scatters his lightning about him and covers the roots of the sea" (36:29-30). Thus far, we have seen the bivalence of the sukkah image structured around the human/divine antithesis.2 As a human habitation, the sukkah is invariably weak: transient, solitary, or already fallen. As a divine habitation, it reflects God's glory and power, whether located on Mount Zion, a metonymy for the Temple in Jerusalem, or in the skies above. This repertory is expanded by the biblical poets' representation of the sukkah as an animal habitation, the lair of a hidden power. The Voice from the Whirlwind addresses Job as follows: "Can you hunt the prey for the lion, / Or satisfy the appetite of the young lions, / when they crouch in their dens (meonot) I or lie in ambush in their covert (bassukkah)?" (RSV 38:39-40). The lions' lair is called sukkah by way of a metonymy: any covered place can be represented by any other one. The image of the lion's covert becomes metaphoric when it is applied to either the human or the divine realms. The lion's sukkah (Ps. 10:9) and misiarim (Ps. 17:12) are associated with the wicked who lie in ambush for the helpless poor. God also dwells occasionally in a leonine den, as in Ps. 76:3, where the psalmist pairs m?onato and sukko. In this instance, God makes war like a powerful lion "on the mountains of prey" (v. 5). For the lion, for the wicked, and for God, the covering of the sukkah allows a hidden power to burst forth from a secret space into public view.</page><page sequence="3">Prooftexts 261 The imagery of hiddenness is theologically significant, since God's power is not always manifest to human beings. For instance, in Ps. 18, the celestial sukkah serves temporarily to screen the divine presence from human view before God makes a decisive appearance in battle: "He made darkness His screen (sitro); dark thunderbolts, dense clouds of the sky, were his pavilion (sukkato) round about Him" (v. 12). The pairing of sukkah with forms of the root str is not an isolated phenomenon, as we shall see in detail below. Among examples already cited, the divine sukkah of Isa. 4:6 provided concealment or shelter (mistor) not for God, but for human beings. Like sukkah, the root str can have both positive and negative nuances, depending on who or what is being concealed. God can conceal the divine presence or a favored human being. The root str thus connotes both the hidden and the sheltering aspects of the biblical God.3 The Hidden God, Samuel E. Balentine's recent study of the hiding of God's face (hester panim) in the Hebrew Bible, argues that the motif of a hidden God is not to be understood simply as a perception of God's anger, nor as a failure on the part of the individual worshipper to understand or perceive God's presence in the world, but rather as central to the Israelite experience of faith. He points to the language of hiddenness in the prayer-poems of the Psalms, where the faithful poets communicate their knowledge of God's presence alongside their knowledge of God's absence. This rich ambivalence is especially characteristic of the psalms of lament, those poems where an individual complains to God of his or her bitter lot and seeks redress of grievances during the course of the poem itself. As Balentine has characterized these poems, they "provide for both the articulation of the experience and a means of coping with the experience."4 Often, therefore, they end with an expression of thanksgiving for having come through an ordeal. We can analyze the sukkah image in these prayer-poems under this twin rubric: the image articulates the paradox of God's hidden presence and therefore helps the speakers cope with their experience of both God's hidden ness and God's presence. In the midst of their disorientation, psalmists reorient themselves to believe in the power of a saving God5 by envisioning themselves hiding within God's presence, in the image of a concealing, sheltering sukkah. Before proceeding to a thematic and theological reading of these psalmic images, we need to appreciate the density of the lexical connections between sukkah and roots expressing hiddenness. The verbal root skk appears three times in Psalms, once linked to the root str (139:13, 15) and twice in a chiastic pattern with forms of the root hsy, meaning, to take refuge (5:12; 91:4).6 The noun sukkah appears five times (10:9; 18:12; 27:5; 31:21; 76:3). Of these instances, four are juxtaposed with the root, str, and in three of these cases, sukkah is also joined with spn, a root often found in wisdom literature to signify that a hidden object is especially treasured.7 Even more striking is the fact that in two of these Psalms where all three roots are found, we can discern a formulaic system, a sure sign that this cluster of associations is part of the language of poetic convention.8 While a formula is an exact repetition of phrases from psalm to psalm, a formulaic system organizes repeated lexical roots in parallel syntactic patterns, but with slight variations among them. A poet develops (or relies on) a</page><page sequence="4">262 NOTES AND READINGS formulaic system because it establishes repeated connections between words and concepts, so that they come to seem as inevitable to the listeners or readers of the poem as they are to the poet. This is all the more likely when the system employs roots already associated in other biblical contexts. The iterative nature of formulaic systems helps establish such associations as traditional ways of viewing their subjects. The parallel placement of repeating roots is readily apparent in both the Hebrew and in my literal English translations: 1. Ki yitspaneni besukko beyom ra ah (27:5a) ("He will treasure me in his pavilion on an evil day") 2. titspenem besukkah meriv leshonot (31:21b) ("You treasure them in your pavilion from contentious tongues.") Each of these requests to be treasured in God's sukkah is completed by a similarly patterned use of the root sir in the opposite half of each verse. The preposition be, expressing a movement inward, is central in both formulaic systems. I quote the first part of each half line: 1. yastireni beseter oholo (27:5b) ("May he conceal me in the concealment of his tent") 2. tastirem beseter paneka (31:21a) ("You conceal them in the concealment of your face / presence.") The poet conveys the intensity of this desirable concealment by doubling the root str. Furthermore, the close association of concealment and tent, seter and ohel, is confirmed by the parallelism of the two terms in Ps. 61:5, where the same syntactic structure is found.9 These formulaic interconnections between the divine sukkah or ohel and the roots sir and spn speak to several emotions that the psalmists hold at the same time: they are vulnerable in a world where God's justice often seems to be hidden. They therefore need to feel specially sheltered, in fact, treasured, by a sheltering God; and they are confident that a special intimacy with God is available to them, particularly through the experience of worship in God's sanctuary. The space of the sukkah is a perfect metaphor for this mix of emotions. Its walls conceal its occupants from those outside who are arrayed against them, but its roof, either open to the sky or to the golden rafters of the Temple, allows a special access for the divine presence. The sukkah/o/iel that is such a compelling metaphor may well be a literal description of what the Psalmists saw in the First Temple, if the ancient mishkan (Tent of meeting or Tabernacle) was reerected within the Holy of Holies, as some scholars hypothesize. Within that large sukkah-like structure, there may also have been a sukkah around the ark itself, as is suggested by God's instruction to Moses: wesakkota (Exod. 40:3).10 Theological metaphors linking divine concealment and presence would have arisen naturally in such an architectural setting. To appreciate the sukkah as a theological metaphor that functions spa tially, it is helpful to see how it compares with the other spaces of the psalmists' imagination. We will look at the spatial organization of our two formulaically linked psalms, 27 and 31, and then look at the sukkah imagery associated with the wicked in Ps. 10. At the start of Ps. 27, the confidence of the opening, "Whom shall I fear?" (v. 1), is immediately countered by the vivid evocation of evildoers, tormentors,</page><page sequence="5">Prooftexts 263 and foes. The vulnerable speaker seems to be out in the open with these threatening enemies. Gan they be the only ones who are liable to "stumble and fall" (v. 2)? This threatening open space is further concertized in the image of the hypothetical army encamped against the speaker (v. 3). The psalmist avoids this space by imagining its opposite, the house of YHWH, which offers both openness and protection. In the triplet of v. 5, three spaces are imagined: sukkah, ohel and tsur. All three may be epithets for the Temple: its inner holy space and its immoveable foundation.11 We can also understand them as a spatial and emotional sequence. Because the poet is comforted by envisioning himself in the intimate space of God's sukkah, he is then able to imagine himself high on a rock, exposed once more, but this time triumphantly invulnerable. This is certainly a climatic image of divine protection: openness without vulnerability. At this point, the mood of the psalm shifts dramatically as most commenta tors have noted, many suggesting that our text is a fusion of two very different psalms. They fail to note that an exalted feeling of security can easily produce the most profound insecurity. Having entered into the concealment of God's tent, seter oholo, the psalmist remembers the opposite feeling of God's hiding his face, hester panim. To express these related feelings, the poet draws first on a formulaic system and then on an oft-repeated formula: "do not conceal your face / presence from me" (al taster panekha, v. 9).12 The expression of both security and vulnerability through the root str indicates the necessary inter relatedness of these emotions and the pivotal, unifying role played by the root str in the psalm. Each emotion must be played out in full. In the extremity of crying out against God's hester panim, the psalmist imagines himself abandoned by both father and mother and implores God to instruct him how to arrive at a path through which he can walk in this world, neither secluded in God's tent, nor exposed on the field of battle. Mediating between these two extremes is the straight path of uprightness (v. 11). If the speaker can wisely learn to enter this space, then he can live without fear and "enjoy the goodness of the Lord / in the land of the living" (v. 13). Turning to the bystanders in the last verse, the psalmist turns his poem into a model of how others might also overcome fear. For the poet of Psalm 31, the problem is how to overcome a profound feeling of shame (vv. 2 and 18). As one who has trusted (vv. 7, 15) and taken refuge (vv. 2, 20) in the Lord, the psalmist repeatedly demands to be saved (vv. 3, 16, 17), couching his requests in highly formulaic language.13 Putting himself in God's hands, he asks for public acknowledgement of YHWH's favor (vv. 8, 17, 22), the special love shown to those who keep the covenant. Instead, the wicked shamelessly conspire against him, whispering and lying arrogantly (vv. 14, 19). He is even shunned in public by mere acquaintances (v. 12). Nowhere in the psalm do we learn of any sin the speaker has committed to deserve such opprobrium. Before the introduction of God's sukkah, spatial images and language with spatial connotations concretize the emotional development of this prayer poem, as they did in Ps. 27. The psalmist feels himself to be trapped: "Bring me out from this net which they have hidden for me" (v. 5). He describes his sorrows with words that call to mind images of narrow straits, tsarot nafshi (v. 8) and tsar li (v. 10). Late in the psalm, he speaks of having been in a besieged city,</page><page sequence="6">264 NOTES AND READINGS hair masor (v. 22). The speaker also knows what it means to be free from such distress: "And you have not imprisoned me in the hand of the enemy, but stood my feet in a wide open place" (v. 9). Escaping from narrow places to wide ones is not, however, a guarantee of personal honor, as indicated by those who continually flee from the poet. Feeling more like a corpse than a human being, he compares himself to a "lost vessel" (v. 13). In this mood, he wishes that his shame be visited upon the wicked, and that they "be silenced in the grave" to which he feels he has been consigned (v. 18). Because shame is a social stigma, it can only be removed in the presence of others, who refuse to participate in shunning. That is why the psalmist petitions that all God's devoted ones be hidden within the divine presence, treasured in God's sukkah (v. 21). Feeling that God is hidden from him, the speaker moves into God's hiddenness and takes the whole community along. After envisioning this movement, the speaker is relieved of all his negative emotions and gratefully expresses his newfound assurance that God will indeed judge the arrogant ones who have plagued him (v. 24). This ultimate justice is part and parcel of God's covenant love, hasdo, which can open up the self-enclosed person, even within a besieged city (v. 22). Like the speaker of Ps. 27, the poet concludes by turning to the congregation of worshippers, using virtually the same formula urging strength, courage, and waiting for the Lord (v. 25). The sukkah in both these psalms, then, functions as a trope of inversion: God's perceived hiddenness is turned by the poets into a secret space where believers can encounter God, singly or collectively. There is another twist to this inversion in Ps. 31, through the pairing of seter and panekha, God's face or presence. Usually the conjunction of these two words expresses a perception of God's absence, Hester panim, as in Ps. 27:9.14 Here, the opposite sense is meant. Seter, we remember, is bivalent: negative if God is perceived as being in hiding, positive if God is perceived as sheltering a human being. When a faithful psalmist desires the seter of "the most high" (91:1), he can choose the protection of God's tent (27:5), wings (61:5), shield (119:114), and, in this single instance, face. Through these anthropomorphic images of a personal God, God's hiddenness turns into concealment for the psalmist, and God's seeming absence into manifest presence. Within the shadows of the divine sukkah, the psalmists hold in tension the twin faces of an invisible God. In a creative adaptation of this formulaic language, the inverting trope of the sukkah is itself inverted in Ps. 10.15 As a result of God's perceived disappearance (the root 'Im in v. 1), a space is opened up in which evil can flourish. A wicked one lies in hidden places (from the root str), on the lookout (from the root spn) for the innocent and helpless, like a lion in its sukkah (vv. 8 9). Given the cluster of these same three roots, we are struck precisely by the absence of the divine sukkah from this psalm: He lurks in outlying places; from a covert (bamistarim) he slays the innocent; his eyes spy out (yilsponu) the hapless. He waits in a covert (bamistar) like a lion in his lair (besukkah); waits to seize the lowly; he seizes the lowly as he pulls his net shut;</page><page sequence="7">Prooftexts 265 he stoops, he crouches, and the hapless fall prey to his might. (10:8-10) In highlighting this absence, I do not mean to suggest that every biblical lion's den implies the divine sukkah. But since God's seeming absence from the world is the psalm's theological and emotional starting point, it must be more than coincidence that our psalmist chose to characterize the godless wicked with the same roots used elsewhere to characterize God's capacity to shelter his dear ones. Inverting an established metaphor for God's own turf, the poet challenges God with his characterization of the wicked, seemingly invulnerable in their covert. In a related characterization in Ps. 17:12, the wicked hide like young lions in secret places, bemistarim. So the psalmist asks to be similarly hidden (tastireni) in the shadow of God's wings (v. 8), for he knows that God's treasure (tsepunekha) awaits him there (v. 14). This more symmetrical use of our motif, with two of the three key roots and the familiar play on sir, illuminates the striking reversal in the roles of the wicked and God that has taken place in both these psalms. Rather than sheltering his dear ones, God has left them to be prey for the wicked. The poet cannot renounce his complaint until God reappears to condemn the wicked and provide justice for the oppressed. The wicked one can freely commit his outrages because he believes that there is no God, and that even if there were, the great el would not look into his affairs. "He thinks, 'God is not mindful, / He hides his face (kislir panav), / he never looks'" (v. 11). The play on the root sir, with both the wicked and God in hiding, points again to a tension at the heart of the poem. Rather than continuing to question God's disappearance, the poet challenges God to reappear by using the wicked as a mouthpiece for expressing his own doubts. To vindicate divine justice, he urges YHWH to rise up (v. 12) and save the lowly and downtrodden (vv. 17-18). The final movement of the psalm is an exhorta tion to fill up the world with the divine presence so noticeably absent in its first half. It specifies no habitation for God, nor does it need to, since, at the day of reckoning, God's power will be everywhere manifest. The sukkah is obviously not the only image through which biblical poets could express their desire to be sheltered in God's presence. The shadow of God's wings, an image often used by the psalmists, offers both shelter and concealment and suggests an equally intimate experience. But the sukkah is more centrally connected to human life: it offers a dream of intimacy with God, dreamt from within the simplest, most basic human habitation, the agricultural hut.16 The transformation of that hut into the divine sukkah is not just a dream of ultimate solitude, however rewarding and necessary such a place of private meditation and prayer might be. It is also centrally connected to the political and liturgical life of the people. To the divine sukkah, Israel brings its complaints about the seeming injustices of God's reign as well as its songs of praise for God's gracious gifts.17 Under the ambivalent sign of that poetic image, the individual poet and the congregation are united in their faithfulness to the hidden presence of their Lord.

I am greatly indebted to Dr. Denise Hopkins of the Wesley Theological Seminary, who collaborated in the formulation of this thesis. Unless otherwise noted, I have used the JPS translations of Nevtim and Keihubim. In discussing individual psalms, I have referred to their authors by male pronouns, but I am aware that psalms could have been composed by female poets. See 1 Chron. 25:5 and 2 Chron. 35:25, which refer to daughters and female singers amidst the Levitical choir. 2.
