<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Root of Freedom in St. Thomas's Later Works In the late 1920's, Dom Odon Lottin, O. S. B., began a study on the theory of liberum arbitrium, which was published as a series of articles and also separately in 1929 \ Among other things, this study showed that St. Thomas made some significant changes in his treatment of human freedom at the time of the composition of De Malo, quaestio VI, and some additional changes in Summa Theologiae, Prima Secundae. The validity of Dom Lottin's conclusions was recognized by the his torians, who have accepted the dating of St. Thomas's works based on this study. But among the expositors of St. Thomas's thought, I have been able to find only one who made use of St. Thomas's text according to this historical view as presented in the 1929 version, Bernard Lonergan, S. 1.2. In 1942, Dom Lottin published a greatly expanded version, in the first volume of his monumentai Psychologie et Morale aux XII et XIII siècles s. This new version received a little more attention. Joseph Romiti, P.I.M.E., made a chronological study of St. Thomas's treatment of the human act as a whole, and agreed with Dom Lottin's conclusions4. Rosemary Z. Lauer argued against one of Dom Lottin's points, asserting that there was no change in the causality of the intellect upon the will, since both formai and final causality were mentioned both be fore and after the De Malo5. Dom Lottin replied to this criti 1 La théorie du libre arbitre depuis S. Anselme jusqu'à S. Thomas d'Aquin, St. Maximin - Louvain 1929. Pp. 163. 2 Bernard Lonergan, S.

Joseph Lebacqz, S. I., fìnally, has argued that the changes mentioned above are mostly verbal and of little significance, and that ali the real prob lems inherent in St. Thomas's theory remain to be solved 7. Even if we were to accept this conclusion without further question, the chronology should not be ignored. The classical expositions of St. Thomas's theory of human freedom seem to be based principally on the doctrine of the De Veritate, and into this framework the distinction between freedom of exercise and freedom of specification, and the movement of the will by God, both taken from the Prima Secundae, are inserted. Verbal sim ilarity of expression in the texts of St. Thomas seems to be accepted as identical to similarity of doctrine. Such a principle is not explicitly stated, of course, but the manner of composition is enough to show that it is actually being followed. Now, if the meaning of the terms has changed, even only a little, then this procedure is not legitimate, unless at least a contextual ex amination has established the mutuai relevance of these texts. But such a study has not been made8. 6 A brief review of the article is given in Bulletin de Théologie an cienne et médiévale 7 (1954-1957), No. 2201, p. 579-580. Dom Lottin adds some additional texts and makes some clarifications in La preme de la li berti humaine chez Saint Thomas d'Aquin, in : Recherches de Théologie Ancienne et Médiévale 23 (1956) 323-330. One of the reasons he is willing to make some concessions is that in the De Caritate, charity is said to be the form of the virtues in the sense of end, p. 325. One could question whether charity is « form of the virtues » in the same sense as, for exem ple, prudence is ; if so, the concessions seem unnecessary. 7 Joseph Lebacqz, S. I., Libre arbitre et jugement, Bruges 1960. 8 Among the « classical » expositions I mean to include not only those of the great Commentators of St. Thomas of preceding centuries, but also the most commonly known and used more recent books and articles which hinge their explanation of freedom on the freedom of the judgment pre ceding the choice, and treat the choice precisely as dealing with means. (I have not included textbooks.) This is one part of the background of the problem which Father Lebacqz has developed. In addition, I have made the statement that Dom Lottin's article has not been used by these expositors. This is a sweeping statement, and one that demands that a complete account be given of the books and articles that have been actually looked at. For this reason, the chronological list of books and articles (given in an Appendix at the end of this article, p. 722 ss.) up to 1945 (we can reasonably set this date as the time when the influence of Dom Lottin's article should be felt) is selective, but from that time on is as complete as bibliographies and cross-references allow.</page><page sequence="3">THE ROOT 01' FREEDOM IN ST. THOMAS's LATER WORKS 703 If there is more than a verbal change between the two sets of texts, then the traditional procedure must have led to a dis tortion of St. Thomas's thought. For, unless a thinker is en tirely eclectic, or has completely preconceived his system in ali its details, then his complete thought cannot be assembled like a mosaic out of snippets of texts gathered indiscriminately from earlier and later works. As in a healthy animai the development of a new member requires corresponding structural and func tional modifications in other parts, so a new distinction or a new causai factor appearing in the development of a living thought implies changes elsewhere. And, just as the functions of an organic whole are fully operative only in the fully grown indi viduai, so the organization of the elements of a thought is most correctly seen in its latest form, not in its preliminary version. The Prima Secundae, therefore, should provide the ruling frame work, and the earlier texts used to complete it (and to provide the developmental understanding of the later one), not in the inverse order. A consequence we should expect, therefore, is that, alongside what I have called the « classical expositions », there should be some others which differ in some significant way, and which stili have a textual basis in St. Thomas 9. 9 Several studies can be mentioned here; it is interesting that ali except one are prior to 1942. Michael Wittmann, Die Lehre von der Willensfreiheit bei Thomas voti Aquin, in : Philosophisches Jahrbuch 40 (1927) 170-188. 28S-30S. Though free will is basically choice, p. 170, freedom is put solely in the will, ρ. 296 297 ; 302-303, and the Prima Secundae is relied on heavily. Rather curiously, the author insists that St. Thomas is a voluntarist, p. 304-305. Jean Laporte, Le libre arbitre et l'attention selon St. Thomas, in : Re vue de Métaphysique et de Morale, 38 (1931) 61-73; 39 (1932) 199-223, 41 (1934) 25-57. Many of the classical authors refer to Laporte. He does say that freedom is reduced to the liberty of j udgment, p. 73; but in the second part, much use is made of the Prima Secundae, the judgment is said to guide the will, on the condition that «nous ayons d'abord pris la partie de nous en référer à la raison et non point au sens», p. 211, and both the beginning and the direction of the deliberation are determined by the will, « sans y ètre elle-mème déterminée par rien d'intellectuelle », as an act of « pure liberty », p. 212. Paul Siwek, S. I., Le conscience de la liberté, in : Gregorianum 16 (1935) 53-73, works with the relation of particular goods to the good in general, p. 56 68-69; there is no analysis of texts. Gerard Smith, S. I., Intelligence and Liberty, in : New Scholasticism 15 (1941) 1-17, uses only the Prima Secundae, and does not reduce the relation to that of means to end. Idem The Nature and Uses of Liberty, in : New Scholasticism 26 (1952) 305-326.</page><page sequence="4">704 GEORGE Ρ. KLUIÌEKTANZ, S. 1. Moreover, if a distortion has taken place, then problems should arise, some internai to the text, some coming from a fresh look at the reality which is being explained. An example of the first sort of problem is the question, Can an angel, in a hypothetical naturai order, commit a sin? The traditional Thomistic doctrine was that an angel could not sin in a naturai order, since its judgment could not be mistaken10. M. Jacques Maritain 11 and Father Philippe de la Trinité, O. C. D.12, from quite different points of view, have concluded that an angel could sin in the naturai order, and that St. Thomas said so, though only obliquely. The second sort of problem arises when the doctrine seems to be in conflict with evidence, or inadequate to explain reality. Thus, the table of « acts » that make up a free choice has been declared to be, not a series of distinct acts in the real order, but a set of « logicai moments » of analysis13, since one can hardly find ali these acts in one's own experience. Again, some modem Thomists unite, or even identify, the last practical judg ment and choice; Father Lebacqz, who has concentrated on the systematic difficulties arising from the relation between judgment and choice, also points to the experiential factor14.

Several articles which move from concrete psychological problems to a consideration of the Thomistic notion of freedom speak in one way or an other of the more basic « choices » that man makes.

Hence, there seems to be good reason for looking into the possi'bilities offered by Dom Lottin's views. In summary forni, the conclusione reached are the following. (1) After the De Malo VI, the will is presented as active 16. (2) Liberty of exer cise is distinguished from liberty of specifìcation17. (3) The Divine Motion is introduced as necessary to the theory of free dom1S. (4) Reason is presented as formai cause in relation to the will act, whereas previously it had been presented as final cause19. (5) There is a two-fold freedom in man: liberum ar bitrium as regards means, libera voluntas as regards ends20. (6) The very term « liberum arbitrium » becomes unimportant21. (7) Finally — and this is not so much a difference as a sum mary statement of St. Thomas's final position — freedom is based on the auto-determination of the will, which in tura is based on the immateriality of thought22. At first sight, these seem to be far-reaching differences. But Dom Lottin himself makes some qualifications. (1) The active character of the will, though stressed in the De Malo VI, had never been denied by St. Thomas23. (2) The distinction between liberty of exercise and liberty of specification is already in the De Ventate, but it is not expressed in these words and is not given major emphasis2i. (3) The Divine Motion is al ready referred to in the Contro Gentiles and the Prima Pars 25. (4) Reason was always said to be a formai cause, along with its function as final cause. Yet, in his later clarification, Dom Lottin is prepared to insist that the emphasis is strikingly dif non-textual and sympathetic treatment is that of Joseph de Finance, S.

In the light of these concessione, it is perhaps easier to understand why Thomists have not felt it necessary to reconsider the traditional doctrine. And the appearance of change can be de-emphasized even more. For example, the term, liberum ar hitrium, far from disappearing, occurs in thirty-six passages in the Prima Secundae27, and eight more times in the Secunda Secundae28 and Tertia Pars29. The distinction between voluntas ut natura and voluntas ut ratio recurs a total of eight times in the Prima Secundae and Tertia Pars, and several times in cruciai passages 30. It is my impression that most of the comparisons (except Dom Lottin's later remarks about the role of form) have been made on isolated points (positiones) ; when such a comparison is expressed in the categories of the earlier works, the really signifìcant differences could well disappear from view. I propose, therefore, in this paper, to examine rather the arguments (viae) and the organization of the ideas81. 26 Lottin, La preuve de la liberté humaine chez Saint Thomas d'Aquin, in : Recherches de Théologie Ancienne et Médiévale 23 (1956) 323-330. 27 Prologue to the Prima Secundae qu. 1, art. 2; qu. 17, art. 1 ad 2; qu. 21, art. 4 ad 2 ; qu. 68, art. 4 ad 2 ; qu. 75, art. 2 ; qu. 77, art. 6 ; art. 8 ad 3 ; qu. 79, art. 2 ; qu. 109, art. 2 ad 1 ; art. 6 ad 1 and 4 ; art. 7 ; qu.

However, the « iudicium rationis liberum » of qu. 10, art. 3 is not an instance of « liberum arbitrium » (as Peter Caramello, Ο. P., editor of the Marietti edition [Rome, 1952], says, p. 59, note 6, ad locum), but the «iudicium perfectum » of Prima Pars, qu. 84, art. 8, which is «hindered» or « bound » by disturbances of the senses, and the « iudicium » of I-II, qu. 77, art. 1. 28 qu. 2, art. 9; qu. 24, art. 1 ad 3, art. 10 ad 3, art. 11; qu. 25, art. 3. 29 qu. 18, art. 1 ad 3, art. 4; qu. 30, art. 1 ad 1. 30 Romiti has claimed this as one of the changes, op. cit.

Et ideo homo non ex ne cessitate, sed libere eligit. The argument of the Prima Pars hinges on the nature of the judgment about contingent things. In the preceding ques tion, the relation of particular goods to the ultimate end was compared to the relation of contingent propositions to the first principles. The discussion concerned only the objects of willing, and the effective middle term of the argument was not the particularity of particular concrete goods, but their relation as means to the good taken absolutely. Moreover, Divine freedom 33 and the freedom of the angels34 are proved in the same way. The argument of the Prima Secundae hinges on the rela tion between the intellect and the will, and concerns acts as well as objects. Question ten in asking about what moves the will divided the question into four parts : whether the will is moved naturally; whether it is necessarily moved by an object; whether it is necessarily moved by the sense appetite (this point we will not consider here) ; and whether it is necessarily moved by God. Although the will as will is « domina sui actus » — master of its own activity, it is stili a nature, and so has a naturai movement over which it is not master35. This naturai move ment is towards the good in general, towards beatitude, and towards the concrete goods of the powers and of the man as a whole 3e. In the second article, the distinction between liberty of exercise and liberty of specification is explicitly given (and referred to in our text on preferential choice) 37. Some objects cannot be repudiated and can not be not willed as long as they are thought of, but man need not positively continue to will them, since he can always cease to think of them — our text adds, « not willing them can be considered a good ».

ΚΙ.υίΙΚΚΤΛΝΖ, S. I. objects, including some of those which are naturally willed, can be considered as particular goods (the particular good is not the universal good ; it therefore lacks some good ; whatever lacks some good can be considered to that extent as evil) and as particular can be simultaneously considered and not willed ; this is the freedom of specification. Our text points out that means with which preferential choice concerns itself are eo ipso known as particular and so fall under the freedom of specification. Finally, the Divine Motion does not ordinarily move the will neces sarily except in those cases to which the will is moved naturally. We can consider this Motion later in detail; for the purpose of our first text we need only keep in mind that the Divine Motion does not necessarily determine the will to one. We must, however, ask what sort of causality the known object exercises on the will, for, if it is a «mover», it must in some way or other be a cause3S. In the Prima Pars and the earlier texts, intellect and will are treated somewhat after the manner of two supposits. This is not meant to imply that St. Thomas did not know, or ever forgot, that man is the agent who knows and wills39. But the act, or rather, object of the intellect, is related directly to the act of the will, at the level of the acts themselves40. Beginning with the De Malo, St. Thomas sets up his analysis in terms of the appetite of a being. In this analysis, he draws a parallel between naturai appetite and animai appetite. In the case of naturai appetite, the form which specifìes the act of appetite is the substantial form. This is formai causality, but not in the sense of the causality of form on matter; rather, it is formai causality in the way in which form causes the properties (proper accidents) of a thing. Implied in this causality is something like efficient causality (in 38 Lottin, La preuve de la libertà humaine chez Saint Thomas d'Aquin, in: Recherches de Théologie Ancienne et Medievale 23 (1956), stresses the phrase « sicut praesentans ei obiectum suum » (I-II, qu. 9, art. 1) and suggests that this minimizes the causality. But in the responso the term « movet » again occurs ; St. Thomas's point, it seems, is to distinguisi! the kinds of causality. 39 There are enough reminders scattered throughout the works ; for example, « actus voluntatis intelligitur ab intellectu, et inquantum aliquis percipit se velie », Prima Pars, qu. 87, art. 4. Romiti, De Processu evolutivo, p. 73-74 stresses the more personal and subjective emphasis of the later treatments. 40 Λ fine example is the often discussed question, « Whether the intellect is nobler than the will?», as in Prima Pars, qu. 82, art. 3. It is almost jarring to move to this question from qu. 87, art. 4.</page><page sequence="11">THE ROOT OF FREF.DOM IN ST. THOMAS'S LATER WORKS 711 the fashion which St. Thomas often calls « emanation » and which implies that the substance exists and is being moved by its efficient cause) as well as final causality, since ali proper accidents are for the perfection of the being whose accidents they are41. Animai appetite has this similarity : the known ob ject is like the substantial form. The agent, specified in an additional way by the known form, has his tendency specified by that form, and so tends as specified agent. The formai causality of the known form is thus not absolutely immediately upon the act of tending, but immediately upon the agent. In thus specifying the agent, the known form provides him with something to which to tend, provided that the known form is that of something known as good42. At the same time, the very limitations which the intellect is capable of recognizing in its object ground the liberty of the agent's response in willing43. This analysis is more metaphysical than the earlier ones, since it works out from the relation of form to tendency in being. It is at the same time more existential and personal, since the being of the agent and the dynamism of his act of existing are involved directly. Thus also the spontaneity of the acting subject is stressed, as Dom Lottin and others have pointed out44. (The subject's spontaneity is not equally operative in the De Veritate and the Prima Pars). 41 See the discussion of the relation of the potencies of the soul to the soul itself in Prima Pars, qu. 77, art. 6. This metaphysical question seems in no way to have been affected by the analysis of the free act itself. 42 Prima Secundae, qu. 9, art. 1 ad 2. On the meaning of the term, « practical intellect », see John E. Naus, S. I., The Practical Intellect ac cording to St. Thomas, Rome 1959. 43 De Malo VI is much more explicit in pointing out particular dif ferences. Since it is the very nature of both intellect and will to reflect on themselves and on each other — a trait which is recognized and ac centuated by St. Thomas throughout his works and equally clearly in Prima Secundae, qu. 9, art. 1 — we need to look for reasons why reflection does not occur when it fails. De Malo VI suggests external circumstances and the disposition of the one who wills, including in the latter case ac quired dispositions (and cf. ad 24). On the other hand, one of the functions of moral virtue is to ensure that our choices are reflective, so that the virtuous person not only per forms better human acts, but more of them, and more humanly, than the person who customarily follows the lead of his passions and the sugges tione received through his senses. 44 Lottin, Psychologie et Morale, p. 253 258; Romiti, De processu evolutivo (cited, note 4), p. 73-74.

This analysis makes rather irrelevant a neo-Scholastic prob lem which Father Lebacqz has stressed. For the neo-Scholastics who occupied themselves with the problem of the relations be tween the last practical judgment and the choice are treating them both at the level of acts. They speak of the mutuai causality after the manner of matter and form — and, be it noted, precisely as regards the choice as free45. Some have even insisted that the last practical judgment and the election are ontologically one and the same 46. Father Lebacqz has argued that this is not Thomistically tenable, on the score that St. Thomas says that one act cannot come from two powers 47. Tex tually, it does not seem to be correct to say that the last practical judgment is identically also the act of choice; experientially, also, he seems to be right. But his further conclusions do not follow, because he also neglects the parallel with naturai appetite and the special meaning which « formai causality » acquires in this context. But does not St. Thomas explicitly speak of a matter-form composition in the act of choice? Indeed he does, and the com position he speaks of seems to be at the level of the two acts themselves. But we must note the precise point which St. Tho mas is making. He is dealing with the nature of choice as the acceptance of means in relation to ends. The arguments he of fers stress the commonly accepted Aristotelian doctrine that to compare and to relate are acts of intellect. In his response, it is the order of means to ends that concerns him. It is this ordered and relational aspect of choice that results from the information of the act of the will by the act of the intellect. 45 Lebacqz (cited above, note 7), ρ. 43-54. In my Philosophy of Human Nature, New York 1953, ρ. 231-248, the same confusion of the two prob lems occurs. 46 Especially A. Sertillanges ; see above, note 14. 47 He quotes De Ventate, qu. 24, art. 5. One could more accurately say that Prima Secundae, qu. 9, art. 1, provides no ground for such an identification. As for the alleged reason, « that one act cannot come from two powers », it is to be said, first, that St. Thomas explicitly says that the electio is one and composite (aliquid unum... compositum) in qu. 9, art. 1, and that he even considers the difficulty formally in the terms urged by Father Lebacqz, Prima Secundae, qu. 56, art. 2, arg. 1, and answers « Ad primum ergo dicendum quod idem actus non potest aequaliter et eodem ordine, pertinere ad diversas potentias, sed secundum diversas rationes, et diverso ordine». See my article, The Unity of Human Opera tion, in: The Modem Schoolman 27 (1950) 85-102, and add: Tertia Pars, qu. 19, art. 2.</page><page sequence="13">713 Hence, it is also significant that the analogy he uses is not that of substantial form to primary matter, but of accidental form to substance (the substance of the act is the tending to the good as ordered ; the order is imposed on that substance)48. Another difficulty against the interpretation presented above can be drawn from a remark of Dom Lottin, that in St. Thomas there is a doublé freedom : freedom of choice and freedom of will49. As we have just read the texts, freedom of choice is just a special case. Why then would St. Thomas deal so exten sively with preferential choice? One answer is clear from what we have just said: choice is not only free but relational, and so it needs special consideration, and indeed St. Thomas concludes that choice is not merely a free tending of the will, but a com posite act of intellect and will. A second reason is the function of preferential choice in the Aristotelian theory of virtue. Moral virtue, in the profound and significant definition of Aristotle, is a self-possession and self-mastery aimed at the preferential choice of the good (habitus electivus bonus) under the direction of pru dence50. Since the analysis of the moral virtues occupies by far the larger part of the Secunda Pars, one should not be surprised to find a very full treatment of choice in the introduc tory consideration of human acts. Next, the genesis of the free act can be considered. In the early works, freedom is coextensive with freedom of choice51. Therefore there are only two possibilities. Directly, one may begin with an end known explicitly and proceed syllogistically to the means, and the moment of freedom occurs when we choose between alternative means; in a more complex fashion, one may begin with an object (which is in fact an intermediate end), for some reason or other proceed analytically back to some ulterior end, and then come back to find freedom as in the direct move ment52. 48 « Sic igitur ille actus quo voluntas tendit in aliquid quod proponitur ut bonum ex eo quod per rationem est ordinatum ad finem, materialiter quidem est voluntatis, formaliter autem rationis. In huiusmodi autem sub stantia actus materialiter se habet ad ordinem qui imponitur a superiori potentia», I-II, qu. 13, art. 1. 49 Lottin, Psychologie et Morale, p. 262. 50 On this notion of moral virtue, see Charles J. O'Neil, Imprudence in St. Thomas, Milwaukee 1955. 51 Explicitly in qu. 82, art. 1 ad 3. 52 The second movement is not expressely mentioned in the text on liberum arbitrimi, but the doublé movement is mentioned earlier in discuss</page><page sequence="14">714 GEORGI·: I'. KLUBERTANZ, S. I. In the Prima Secundae the situation is conceived differently. True enough, there is a place — and, in the case of moral virtue, an important one — for the movement from end to means. But, quite independently of this case, and so including even the decision to take steps to reach an end, any human act can be considered. A particular human act begins with something naturally willed 53. ing the difference between reason, intellect, intelligence, and the habit of first principles, qu. 79, art. 8, 10, and 12, and earlier, on the angelic intellect, qu. 60, art. 2 ; qu. 62, art. 8 ad 3. 53 On naturai acts of the will, see Robert P. Sullivan, Naturai Necessitation of the Human Will, in: Thomist 14 (1952) 351-399 490-528 (and as a hook: River Foresi, 111. 1952; also William R. O'Connor, Naturai Appetite·, ibid., 16 (1953) 361-409. Neither of these authors pay much attention to the chronology. Father Sullivan notes that different things are said to be naturally willed, but solves the differences with a conceptual scheme, not seeing that the place of the naturai willing of concrete goods in the Prima Secundae is much more important than it was before the De Malo. An earlier treatment of naturai appetite, Gustaf J. Gustafson, The Theory of Naturai Appetency in the Philosophy of St. Thomas Aquinas, Washington : 1945, does not deal with the will as a naturai appetite except at the very end, p. 101-113, where it touches briefly on its importance for freedom and for ethics. M. J. Faraon, Ο. P., The Metaphysical and Psychological Principles of Love, Dubuque 1952, covers some of the same ground from a different point of view. To counter-act these highly abstract treatments, the much more concrete approaches of the following are recommended. Robert O. Johann, S. I., The Meaning of Love, London 1954. Joseph de Finance, S. I., La motion du bien in: Gregorianum 39 (1958) 5-42. Frederick E. Crowe, S. I., Complacency and Concern in the Thought of St. Thomas, in: Theological Studies 20 (1959) 1-39 198-230 343-348. André Jacques Bruneau, Ο. P., Réalité spirituelle de l'amour, in : Revue Thomiste 60 (1960) 381-416. On the priority of the naturai act of the will, I must disagree with S. Pinckaers, La structure de l'ade humain suivant saint Thomas, in : Revue Thomiste 55 (1955) 400. He admits that this is the correct psycho logical account, but argues that the causai order proceeds from the « formed will » to the « lesser will ». The « formed will », the absolute will which is the free decision, is indeed the end of the naturai act, but it seems to me that what is really in question is the order of efficiency. In the order of efficiency, the will, through the intellect and the latter's power of reflection, moves itself from the velleity to the formed and fully human decision. Pinckaers also says that « mème dans l'ordre psychologique et géné tique, il y a toujours un vouloir absolu à l'origine» (p. 401). Now, as St. Thomas says, « the virtus of the first intention which is directed to the last end remains in every appetition of anything, even if the person does not actually think of the last end», Ί-ΙΤ, qu. 1, art. 6 ad 3. If this means « the order to the good in general », it is universally valid. But such a «first intention» is not an ad·, it is the very ontological essence. of the will itself ; hence, it cannot be invoked as a cause in the order</page><page sequence="15">THE ROOT 01·' FKEEDOM IN ST. THOMAS'S LATER WORKS 715 The things naturally willed are : beatitude (though one may well question how often this occurs), the goods of the various powers, such as knowledge, virtue, recreation, food and the other goods of the body, and the goods of man as a whole, such as life, being, perhaps also such goods as friendship, and the like54. What is naturally willed is determined in the first instance by the substantial nature and its essential properties, but also by of efficiency. If, on the other hand, the first intention is that directed to what the individuai person has determined to be his last end, then that first intention cannot be always at the origin of every free act, certainly not of that free act by which it itself is made to be the first intention of this man (see below, note 61), nor of his acts which are praeter inten tionem finis, nor of any radicai change in his over-all orientation. It seems necessary to say (1) that certain over-all intentions of ours do influence a great number of acts, but (2) that often we are not in any way thinking of the objects of those intentions, and so cannot be explicitly and distinctly be willing them. How do these free acts, made once and not now actual, continue to influence other acts? To cali them « virtual intentions » does not seem reasonable ; they can hardly be called habitus; they might be acquired dispositions which influence volitions (see below, note 56), but their nature is stili obscure, and has not been well treated by anyone. In this and similar discussions dealing with the final end of man in the concrete, two points from the Secunda Pars are very helpful. (1) Some men take their final end to be a composite one, for example, of « pleasure, security, the basic needs of life, and virtue », which are taken together as making up one single perfect good (qu. 1, art. 5, arg. 1 and ad 1). (2) A person without faith and charity need not always act inasmuch as he lacks these virtues; he may act inasmuch as he has some good, and then his act is good « in its kind, though not perfectly good, since it is without the order to the last end» (II-II, qu. 23, art. 7 ad 1). Even « one who has a vice may unexpectedlv break out into a virtuous act, because reason is not totally corrupted by an evil habit » (I-II, qu. 78, art. 2). The good acts in question may be truly, though only naturally [i. e., secundum naturam] good (e. g., « conservatio civitatis vel aliquid hu iusmodi », II-II, qu. 23, art. 7) ; these need not be merely physically good (as is suggested in I-II, qu. 109, art. 2, on the score of a quotation from a pseudo-Augustinian work cited in art. 5; on this quotation, see the note of P. Caramello ad locum, ed. Marietti, p. 530). If we take these two points together, we can understand the apparent naturai goodness of some who explicitly reject the true last end of man, yet consistently practice some virtues, for these may be part of the last end to which they direct their lives. 54 Qu. 10, art. 1 mentions the ultimate end, « ali things which are suited to the one willing according to his nature», the knowledge of the truth, being, and living; qu. 1, art. 5, the ultimate end; qu. 1, art. 6 ad 1 and ad 2, play and speculative knowledge ; qu. 5, art. 4 ad 2, art. 8 ad 2, and III, qu. 18, art. 1 ad 3, beatitude (felicity) ; qu. 74, art. 7, pleasure ; qu. 80, art. 2, that to which passion inclines; Tertia Pars, qu. 18, art. 3, health; qu. 14, art. 2 and ad 1, qu. 18, art. 5: the will naturally rejects death, injury to the body, «and other things like that».</page><page sequence="16">716 CEORIIK 1\ KI.UBF.RTANZ, Β. I. the individuai nature with its concrete dispositions55. In the De Malo VI it is further indicated that acquired dispositions may also come into play here, as well as habits and passions 56. This naturai act of the will is directed to the object according to its absolute consideration 57 ; it is not « human » in its highest sense 58 ; it is more of a velleity than an absolute willing59. But, unless a man is precipitated into action by passion or by circumstances, or blocked from further consideration by ignorance or error, it is naturai to reflect both on the full particularity of the object and on his own willing of that object60. This moment of reflec tion is also the moment of freedom, for it reveals at least that he need not continue to think about that object, and in the case of most objects it may show some deficiency; in some cases it may completely change the object from good to bad or vice versa. It is interesting to note that this much more metaphysical analysis also rings true to experience, whereas the earlier texts must be forced, unless, as is often the case, the experiential reference is simply neglected by the author. It is corroborated by the doctrine of the moralists about the « motus primo-primi ». It makes sense of St. Thomas's doctrine that the first free act of an unbaptized person must be either a mortai sin or a morally good act61. Finally, it fits in with St. Thomas's doctrine of the Divine Motion which we must now consider. Doni Lottin has pointed out the simultaneous appearance in St. Thomas's text of the distinction between the liberty of spe cification and the liberty of exercise and the explicit statement of the necessity of the Divine Motion for willing at ali62. He argues that the assertion that the agent is the cause of his be ginning to will requires, on the « quidquid movetur » principle, that he be moved previously by God. If my analysis is correct, 55 Prima Secundae, qu. 10, art. 1 ad 3. 66 In the body of the article, and also ad 24. 57 III, qu. 18, art. 3; art. S ad 1.

But there the doctrine is more of an isolated posi(ioj since the naturai act of the will is not prominent. 58 III, qu. 19, art. 2; I-II, qu. 74, art. 10, speak of a sudden movement even in the higher reason which seems to be according to the absolute consideration of the object. 50 III, qu. 21, art. 4. 00 James Collins, The Thomistic Philosophy of the Angels, Washing ton : 1947, in his analysis, also bases freedom on the act of reflection, p. 240 242.</page><page sequence="17">THE ROOT OF FREKDOM IN ST. THOMAS'S LATER WORKS 717 it would be slightly more accurate to say that the parallel between naturai inclination and animai appetite requires both the distinc tion between the two sorts of liberty and the Divine Motion63. St. Thomas's further elaboration of the will series : that any series of will acts begins with something that is naturally willed, and that therefore according to its absolute consideration is in trinsically good or evil, clarifies the doctrine of the Divine Motion even more. There is no point in giving yet another account of the long standing dispute about « concursus ». Let it be sufficient to note, sadly, that the objections of each party to the other's positions are much more convincing than the arguments they offer in favor of their own, and secondly that the following remarks are not 61 I-II, qu. 89, art. 6. 62 Lottin, Psychologie et Morate, ρ. 2S7-2S8. But it should be noted that the Prima Pars already strongly insists on the necessity for the Di vine Motion. Thus, qu. 83, art. 1, ad 2 and 3, and qu. 105, art. 4 and 5. There is, however, this difference, that the De Malo VI and the Prima Secundae stress the passage from potency to act in the beginning of will ing, whereas the earlier texts speak rather of « the operation of God in every operation of nature and the will ». 63 In the early works, there are three possibilities. The first is that the question simply does not occur. The second is that the object, or the intellect, acts efficiently upon the will, a solution which Cajetan chooses, and which he explicitly adopts from Averroes, In Primarn Partern, qu. 80, art. 2 (Ed. Leonine, voi. 5, p. 285, No. 8) : « optime dixit Averroes : scilicet effective secundum quod est apprehensum et fìnaliter secundum quod est extra animam ». (On Cajetan, see André Jacques Bruneau, Ο. P., La causalité physique de l'objet sur facte d'aimer d'après Cajetan, in: Revue Thomiste 52 [1952] 142-148). The third possibility would be that the will is moved to act at the moment of the creation of the soul, and that this act remains permanently; cf. Siewerth (cited, note 9), p. 60-61. Even though these possibilities are no longer relevant because of the solution given in the Prima Secundae, a similar problem remains as far as the sense appetites are concerned. The problem is not dis'cussed by the Thomists as far as I know. Yet sense appetite has some real spontaneity — it cannot be a mere passio. Perhaps the efficient causality of the esti mative power accounts for the beginning of a sensory appetency. But when the agent himself, through his will, is made to be the ef ficient cause of his own act, and he begins to will in time, then he must be moved by an agent in act, and because of the spirituality of the will, the only agent that can move him is God. This is the argument of the De Malo. The Prima Secundae does use this argument also (especially in art. 5, against the theory that the celestisl bodies move the will), but mainly argues from the nature of the will's act, which is to be the intrinsic tendency of the agent himself. This, says St. Thomas, can be actuated only by that cause which is at the same time the cause of that nature. Secondly, the will's act is to tend to the good in common; such an act can be caused only by an agent who is the universal good (qu. 9, art. 6).</page><page sequence="18">718 GEOKlll·: Η. KUIISKKTANZ, S. 1. offered under the illusion that thev solve everything; much less, that anyone ought to be convinced by them. But perhaps some one will find a hint of a solution in the suggested re-alignment of texts. The Divine Motion is necessary because a man, who was previously not willing at ali, now begins to will, or who begins to will something to which he could not, or at least, did not move himself from a previous actual state of willing. The only cause capable of acting on the will in this way is God. Under normal conditions what begins the new series is something natu rally willed, that is, loved or hated 64 ; « sometimes, God specially moves some persons to will something determinately which is good, as is the case of those whom He moves by grace » °5. Now, whatever is naturally willed is, under its absolute consideration, a naturai good or evil ; it is not yet a moral good or evil. It is right and according to nature that such goods or evils be loved or hatedG6. Without such Divine motion there would be no willing at ali, and with it the velleity must necessarily exist67. But from here on man can fail. For the point of being put into act concerning something which is good in its absolute con sideration is that man should reflect whether in the concrete and ali things considered he should absolutely will that act or object, 64 The analysis must follow this order. First, because, apart from a miraculous intervention, the Divine Motion is given concretely when the creature is disposed proximately to be so moved; otherwise, the two sources of the will's movement (from the part of the object and from God) would be intrinsically unrelated. Second, because, as Siewerth points out, there must be a «priority» (not in time) on the side of the object, since the object is the end, and the end is the first cause and the very reason why the efficient cause acts, op. cit. (in note 11), p. 60. 65 Qu. 9, art. 6 ad 3. 66 Texts cited above, note 54 and note 57. 67 The motion is absolutely necessary, qu. 9, art. 4, so that without it there could be no willing at ali, art. 6 ad 3 ; with it, it is not possible that the will's act not take place — « si Deus movet voluntatem ad aliquid, incompossibile est huic positioni [Dom Lottin suggests that we should read « huic motioni »] quod voluntas ad illud non moveatur », qu. 10, art. 4, ad 3. That this act is a velleity follows from the text quoted above, note 59. Because the will act, in its full and absolute sense, follows naturallv from the first movement through the naturai reflexivity of intellect and will, the Divine Motion does not, properly speaking, necessitate the will, but rather moves it according to its nature. Additional important texts on the Divine Motion in the Prima Secundae are: qu. 68, art. 2, 3, 4; qu. 109, art. 1, 2 and ad 1, art. 6, and 9; qu. Ili, art. 2; qu. 112, art. 3. 68 1 think this is why St. Thomas keeps on saying that the Divine</page><page sequence="19">THE KOOT OF FKEEDOM IN ST. THOMAs's LATER WORKS 719 or whether he should not68. If, 011 reflection, he fìnds that he should absolutely will what he is inclined to, the Divine Motion continues on in ali its ontological fullness into the free act itself. If he finds that he should not, but neglects the practical applica tion of the moral rule, ali that there is of actuality in his choice is stili due to the originai Divine Motion, but the sin is his own69. This sketch of a solution is open to serious objections, but I believe that « answers » of a sort can be given. The easiest to answer is that it does not safeguard the Divine Foreknowledge. For one can retort that St. Thomas himself explicitly rejected any foreknowledge of a free act, and insisted that the very Motion is always according to the nature of the will, and why he can say that it would be repugnant to the will to be rnoved of necessity, since it pertains to the Divine Will « that not only something be done by the thing which it moves, but also that it be done in the way it is suitable to the latter's nature», qu. 10, art. 4 ad 1. But the Divine Motion is not a mechanical solution, nor, as it were, a Constant « tinkering » with creation, for it is always given « to the universal object of the will which is the good» (qu. 9, art. 6 ad 3). That is to say, that the ground or reason for which the will is moved is always the same, and its formai character, of heing a movement to the good, is the same in every case. Thus, just as the will «is indifferently related to many things » [speaking in general, that is, not when a naturally willed object is present], so also « God moves the will, that he does not determine it to one of them with necessity» (qu. 10, art. 4 [and in this sense, speak ing in general, we could say of the Divine Motion that it is « indifferent »). But, concretely speaking, the Divine Motion cannot be « indifferent » ; it is as determinate as the act to which it moves the will. 1 do not see how we can say that there is ever an act of the will whose object is the good in general, nor are there any texts which say that; St. Thomas only says that the will tende to the good in general, « as does any power to its object» (qu. 10, art. 1). Hence, to speak of an «indifferent Motion» seems to be not the most apt use of words. 69 If I understand the position of M. Jacques Maritain correctly, this is somewhat the same as the solution he has been proposing ; see especially the article previously cited, on the sin of the angel (above, note 11); St. Thomas d'Aquin et le prohlème du mal in: Vie intellectuelle, XIII année, No. 6 (1945) 30-49; Court traité de l'existence et de l'existant, Paris: 1947, eh. 4 (which is in principle accepted by J. de Finance, S. I., Existence et libertà, p. 289, note 36) ; Raison et raisons, Paris 1947, « la dialectique immanente du premier acte de liherté ». On M. Maritain's theory, see Marie-Joseph Nicolas, Ο. P., La liberté humaìne et le problème du mal, in : Revue thomiste 48 (1948) 191-217. (I am not sure that what is said in this present article is exactly the same, because for Maritain, the Divine motion moves the will to its naturai ends «sub consideratione regulae» [Nicolas, art. cit., p. 211], whereas I would say that the Divine Motion moves the will to its naturai ends absolutely speaking, and has as its inner finalitly that man consider the rule in making his decision).</page><page sequence="20">720 GEORGE Ρ. ΚLURERTANZ, S. 1. question is a bit of anthropomorphism 70. God is simply not in time. In His eternity — which we cannot conceive — He is present to the free act as actual, and He knows it inasmuch as His Divine Motion is used in one way or the other. But what about Providence and Predestination ? It would be nice if we could cry « anthropomorphism » again and be satisfied ; it is possible, but not very satisfying, to say, « I can see that pre destination must be certain, and I can also see the proposed theory of the Divine Motion leaves man's experienced freedom intact without verbal tricks; I do not see how it explains pre destination, but, after ali, we are not supposed to try to explain God » n. Perhaps St. Robert Bellarmine's congruism has more to it than he is ordinarily given credit for, particularly when it is juxtaposed with some of St. Augustine's profound insights on the will's complacency in the good. Perhaps the cynical com ment, « Every man has his price », conceals a profound truth, that the rational creature is unalterably rational and in his deepest being unalterably ordered to love the good72. Thus, God, Who knows the individuai completely, could know, without any viola tion of freedom, what dispositions he would need to respond to grace 73. That men, even without sin, can have no right to grace, need not be argued here; that God's mercy to some sinners is beyond our comprehension also need not be argued. I think we can assume that God does give many intrinsically and entirely sufficient graces to those who by their own free choice are lost. St. Thomas's theory of freedom thus trails off into mystery at two points : the mystery of the person who, without any pre determination, freely determines himself to good or evil. His action in so doing is rational in one sense, in the sense, namely, that if he chooses the good, it is because he chooses it to be good, and if he rejects it, it is because he sees it to be in some way 70 Thomists here habitually cite Prima Pars, qu. 14, art. 13, and with good reason. 71 This is about what is said by Philippe de la Trinité, Ο. C. D., Ν otre liberté devant Dieu, in: Structures et liberté, Études Carmélitaines 35 (1958) 47-76, especially, p. 72, note. 78 «... voluntas aliter se habet ad bonum et aliter ad malum. Ex na tura enim suae potentiae inclinatur ad bonum rationis, sicut ad proprium obiectum; unde et omne peccatum dicitur esse contra naturam [qu. 71, art. 2] », I-II, qu. art. 3, « eo quod ratio non totaliter corrumpitur », ibid., art. 2; and cf. II-II, qu. 23, art. 7. 73 Perhaps this is something like what Fr. Philippe means, art. cit., p. 72-74.</page><page sequence="21">THE ROOT OF FREEDOM IN ST. THOMAs's LATER WORKS 721 deficient. But man's free act is not rational in the narrow sense, namely, that there is a sufficient reason on purely intelligible grounds for his decision. The second mystery is that of God's love for man. But if we cannot explain our own free decisions in a series of pat propositions, and even less those of other men, how can we expect to comprehend the free decisions of God? It behooves us to believe and trust His infinite goodness. But in between these two points of mystery, the theory of the Prima Secundae is rather surprisingly complete and entirely coherent. It might not be as fully intelligible if we did not have the earlier works, with their less profound grasps of the problems, but it cannot be explained out of them nor reduced to them. The differences, as we have seen them, can be summarized in a series of conclusions, put parallel to those which we have attached to those of Dom Lottin particularly. (1) The will is an « active principle», but stili a passive power in two ways : it is moved in the line of formai causality by the object, and in the line of efficient causality by God. (2) Liberty of exercise is distinguished from liberty of specifica tion, yet both these liberties depend on one and the same power of the intellect. (3) The Divine Motion is necessary to the theory of freedom, in that the will is the agent's power of tending. (4) Reason is the formai cause of the will's act, in the way in which form is the formai cause of a substance's properties. (5) Preferential choice is merely a special case of the general theory of freedom, but it has a two-fold reason for being dis cussed as a separate problem : it is a composite act as containing a formai relation of means to end, and it is particularly important for the theory of virtue. (6) The term « liberum arbitrium » is not useful in the technically exact analysis of freedom, but it remains a useful way to refer to the free act or the power of freedom in non-technical passages, or in general. (7) Freedom is based on the auto-determination of the will, which in turn rests on the intellect's power to reflect on itself and on the will. (8) If any one single internai factor can be put at the source of these changes, it is the new metaphysical understanding of animai appetite even as rational and free as parallel to naturai appetite. « Gregorianum » XLII (1961) - voi.

Adler, The Idea of Freedom (New York 1958); this discussion of freedom is arranged according to the problems and contro versies involved; St. Thomas is treated in the relevant places, but passim, more with a view to specifying the problem. Gerard Verbecke, La developpement de la vie volitive d'après S. Tho mas, in : Revue Philosophique de Louvain 56 (1958) 5-34. Angelo Sferrazza, S. I., Come nasce et si evolve la libertà di scelta, in : Divus Thomas 35 (1958) 37-49. These articles and books are not of equal value for ali purposes. Some are widely used; some have a strong systematic allure. The writings of Marc, Maritain, Pegis, Siewerth, Simon, and Verbecke are especially good for strength of analysis and experiential richness. Adler's study is dialectically much more inclusive (both of problems and of authors), and is valuable both for stimulation and for a wealth of sources. Some relatively recent general works do not clearly belong in the category just listed for various reasons, though they are more easily put here than anywhere else. Carlo Giacon, S. I., Le grandi tesi de tomismo, Como 1945, on freedom, p. 183-186; the basic relation used is that of particular to general goods.</page><page sequence="24">724 GEORGE 1'. Kl.UI'.ERTANZ, s. χ. Jean Laporte, Im conscience de la libertà, Paris 1947. The treatment is pretty much in terms of libre arbitra, but no textual references are given. Jacques Maritain, La dialectique immanente du première acte de li bertà, in : Raison et Raisons, Paris 1947, p. 131-165 ; this essay had previ ously appeared in 1945 ; Maritain's thought is more easily accessible in the article cited above, while his important later contribution is cited in note 11. Idem, De Bergson à Thomas d'Aquin, Paris 1947, p. 200; a rather brief comment. Manuel Rio, Estudios sobre la libertad humana, Anthropos y Anagke, Buenos Aires 1955 ; rather a study of the relation of liberty to necessity in many areas ; there is a section in which there are a number of references to St. Thomas, but the treatment remains rather general. Etienne Gilson, The Christian Philosophy of St. Thomas Aquinas, Lon don 1957; the originai French text is of course more than a decade earlier; the treatment of human freedom is based on the relation of the particular goods to the general good, p. 241-243; freedom of exercise is stressed, p. 247, Three somewhat Suarezian articles can be noted here, since they do also talk about the text of St. Thomas and the Thomistic interpreta tions : Baltasar Perez Argos, S. I., El determinativo funcional de la vo luntad : el ' instinctus naturae ' y el ' imperium rationis ', in : Pensamiento, 7 (1951) 295-319; pure, free autodetermination, p. 318. Luis E. Carranza, S. I., La libertad, in: Ciancia y Fe, TU nos. 11-12 (1947) 65-81; V, no. 17 (1949) 79-96; liberty is « dominium effectus», p. 70 ; the article as a whole is rather slight; Jakob Gemmel, S. I., Zu einer neuen Begriffsbestimmung der mcnschlichen Freiheit, in: Scholastik 12 (1937) 547-551; mainly con cerned with a criticism of Wroniecki (cited, note 8). There are two unclassifiable items. A. Meunier, Le libre arbitre, in : Revue Ecclàsiastique 31 (1939) 106-110; 179-183, speaks of a mastery of one's judgment of value. Nazareno Camilleri, S. D. B., De ineffabili es sentia metaphysica libertatis, Turin 1949, wants to find a formai definition of liberty which is identical in God and creatures; he says it is a formai, relational property, and claims that as such it is entirely independent of questions about the origin of the free act; he thus hopes to settle the disputes about premotion and predetermination. Because this article is secondarily concerned with what writers since 1945-1950 have had to say about the Thomistic theory of liberty, for the sake of completeness Τ will add the following references which seem to be pertinent, but which I have not seen. Raphael Lopez de Munàin, O. F. M., El problema de la libertad y los doctores franciscanos del siglo XIII, in : Verdad y Vida 5 (1947) 283 307 ; should be useful as a supplement to the historical study of Dom Lottin. M. Mui.ler, Dàterminisme et libre arbitre, in : Rev. Théol. et Phil. 33 (1945) 218-220; a reference I have not been able to identify. Mtro. Ortùzar, Fr. M. O. de M., El libre albredrio y el principio de finalidad, in: Estudios 6 (1950) 17-34; also not identifiable. Idem, El libre Albredrio en sus Causas Final y Efficiente, in: Estu dios 7 (1951) 7-28. Activités philosophiques, 1945-1946 a publication not otherwise identified by the author who used the reference, is said to have something on liberty. George ρ. Klubertanz, S. i.</page></plain_text>
