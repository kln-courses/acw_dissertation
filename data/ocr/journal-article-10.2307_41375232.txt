<plain_text><page sequence="1">SPECTRUM Colour and wit SILK MOSAIC TAPESTRIES BY LUCIENNE DAY Royal National Theatre, Lyttleton Foyer 19 March- 2 8 April 1990 Tangrams 3 &amp; 4 Anyone interested in quality, colour, texture or style, will have found a visit to this exhibition worthwhile and, indeed, stimulating. There were 42 works displayed, ranging in size from 129 X 177 cm to 37 x 37 cm, and in price from .£4,600 to jí 265 , and all intended for wall-hanging. They are therefore described as tapestries, although actually con- structed from little pieces of woven silks (sometimes as small as 1 cm square) which have been sewn together as in patchwork or quilting. The programme notes told that all of this sewing had been done by hand, and one is filled with admiration for Lucienne Day's talented assistants, Karin Riley and Henrietta Brooks who did it all. Unfortunately, the works had not been dated, either on 500 the captions or in the handlist, so that one was left to speculate on when the Japanese (Kyoto) /Chinese (Tangram) influences had occurred and whether the contrasting colour palettes were influenced by contemporary fashion or not. Colour was the dominating element in the exhibition and it was delightful to see how a talented textile designer had used the richness of colour and the 'shot' effects of the high quality woven silks as her painter's palette. It would have been interesting to know whether she found it possible to select all the coloured silks from commercial ranges or whether it had been necessary to dye special shades for some of the effects. With such importance attaching to colour, it is sad that the Lyttleton venue admits no natural light and that the artificial spot lighting itself often colours the exhibits in an unhelpful way. One was left wondering how the large commissioned pieces (for example, Aspects of the sun , five large pieces for the John Lewis Partnership and The window for the West Foyer of the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre) will relate to the settings for which they were designed. The most positive conclusion one can draw from the Lyttleton setting is that the introduction of well designed textiles can relieve even the grim walls of a brutal concrete bunker. Because the technique of construction has such a dominant visual impact, freedom to vary the design is inevitably restricted. As another textile person, I wondered whether the aid of the computer had been invoked in designing within so rigid a modular framework, surely ideally suited to CAD? For this reviewer, the architectural and abstract pieces worked better than the anthropomorphic, though the representation of the group of six ducks as decoys rather than as lively, was a typically witty solution. Such humorous touches can be found in many of the works - the Sun in Partial Eclipse has closed eyes - adding amusement to a thoroughly enjoyable exhibition.
