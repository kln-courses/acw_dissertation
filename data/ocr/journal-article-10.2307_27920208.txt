<plain_text><page sequence="1">Modernity, Mestizaje, and Hispano Art: Patrocinio Barela and the Federal Art Project Stephanie Lewthwaite New Mexico's reputation as a cultural center dedicated to the preserva tion and revival of Native American and Hispano arts since the early 1900s is well documented. While the anthropological and archaeological "discovery" of the Southwest, the art colonies of Taos and Santa Fe, and the revival of Spanish colonial arts under Anglo patrons are well known, the Hispano artists who straddled multiple art worlds during the early twentieth century are less so.1 The "recovery" of Hispano artists?initiated by William Wroth and Charles Briggs and continued more recently by Laurie Kalb and Tey Marianna Nunn?remains far from complete.2 Although we know more about the Hispano artists who achieved regional and national acclaim during this period, most often through the New Deal's WPA-funded Federal Art Project (FAP), Eurocentric aesthetic and anthropological categories of place, tradition, and authenticity have occluded the significance of their work. As Tey Marianna Nunn claims, Hispanos were invariably perceived as ethnic craftspeople rather than as artists in their own right.3 The positioning of Hispano art through terms such as craft, folk, and primitive precludes a thorough analysis of the connections among art, ethnicity, and modernity, and an understanding of Hispano artists as "modern" cultural agents. I examine the life and work of Hispano artist Patrocinio Barela. A santero sculptor (a carver of saints and devotional images) sponsored ,by the FAP in 1935, Barela was one of the few Hispanos to achieve national acclaim as an artist rather than as a craftsperson. Barela lay at the intersection of several complementary discourses about art and Americanism during the New Deal. Barela was an everyman, a universal laborer-cum-artist who was both a "modern primitive"4 and a product of cultural mixing between Europe and indigenous America. Barela Stephanie Lewthwaite is a lecturer in the School of American and Canadian Studies at the University of Nottingham, United Kingdom. Journal of the Southwest 52,1 (Spring 2010) : 41-70</page><page sequence="2">42 Journal of the Southwest symbolized the New Deal's drive to democratize art by promoting a more pluralistic Americanism and by improving inter-American relations. However, New Deal rhetoric elevated Barela while sidelining him from modernity as a primitive, untrained, and instinctive artist. Barela has rarely been considered as a modernist in the conventional sense.5 Yet, a re-examination of Barela's aesthetic forms and the multiple artistic, social, and ethnic worlds in which he circulated as a "transcultural agent" sug gest the emergence of an "alternative hybrid modernism."6 Barela must be repositioned within an evolving modernist multicultural art canon, for the wider processes of modernization and intercultural exchange that impacted Hispano communities during this period deeply informed Barela's work and the evolution of a new santero aesthetic. Hispano Art, Anglo Patronage, and the New Deal New Mexico's reputation as a cultural center dedicated to the preser vation and revival of Native American and Hispano art after the early 1900s framed the New Dealer's response to Barela's work. The state became "America's Orient" and an alternative cultural frontier where archaeologists, anthropologists, and avant-garde artists "discovered" new models of cultural exchange and coexistence. The state's rural, folk, and indigenous communities in particular served as bulwarks against the modern machine age and as sites for spiritual and cultural rebirth.7 In the midst of America's "crisis of modernity," fears about cultural loss and regional distinctiveness spawned efforts to preserve local ethnic cultures, and Native American and Hispano arts in particular.8 Yet, the Hispano revival derived less momentum regionally and nationally than the Native American revival, because Hispano arts were invariably viewed as utilitarian objects rather than as art. Anthropologists and archaeologists demonstrated greater interest in the indigenous Pueblo culture.9 However, parallels between the treatment of Native American and Hispano arts exist, for Hispano art was also subject to the preservationist impulses of Anglo artists and reformers during the 1920s and 1930s. This revival was driven by vocational manual arts training programs in rural Hispano schools and by the Spanish Colonial Arts Society, established in Santa Fe in 1925 under Mary Austin and Frank Applegate. The society's retail outlet, the Spanish Market, encouraged Hispanos to produce and</page><page sequence="3">Modernity and Mestizaje 43 sell goods locally. Its replacement, the Native Market (1934-38), forged connections with New Deal reformers who deployed the sale of local arts as a mode of economic relief for Hispano communities hit by the Great Depression.10 Thus, the revivals of the 1920s fertilized the New Deal's sponsorship of regional ethnic art, for there was a distinct continuity between the two in terms of ideological commitment and personnel. New Deal art was simultaneously a form of work relief and a socially conscious art designed to unite and uplift the nation through a democratic and pluralistic Americanism. Running from 1935 to 1943, the Federal Art Project, which replaced the earlier Public Works of Art Project (PWAP), built specifically on the preservation and democratization of art. New Mexico's state director of the FAP, Russell Vernon Hunter, employed Anglos, Native Americans, and Hispanos as artists and teachers in com munity art centers and vocational schools. One of FAP's main projects in terms of the recovery of Hispano art was the Portfolio of Spanish Colonial Design. Completed in 1937 under the direction of E. Boyd and integrated into the national Index of American Design, the portfolio project employed artists to produce watercolor copies and designs of Spanish colonial arts. The portfolio included designs of original santos? devotional images of saints painted on wooden panels or carved from wood. The santero, or saint-making, tradition had been a key focus of the 1920s revival: Austin, Applegate, and local patron Lorin W. Brown collected old santos while promoting the work of living santeros such as Jos? Dolores L?pez during Holy Week and religious fiestas.11 Patrocinio Barela and the Santero Tradition The santero was part of a wider tradition of saint making brought to New Mexico by Spanish colonists during the seventeenth century. The santero made the altarpieces, statues, and panels that decorated churches, local homes, and religious processions. The first images were painted on deer and elk skins. From the eighteenth century, however, santeros began sculpting their images to produce two- and three-dimensional varieties: retablos (painted wooden panels) and bultos (carved images). As the Spanish ceased importing figures of saints, local artists evolved their own regional style. Despite the arrival of commercial production during the nineteenth century, the santero tradition spawned a lineage of artists that was secured and sustained through training and kin net</page><page sequence="4">44 Journal of the Southwest works.12 As William Wroth notes, "parallel traditions" characterized the industry?some santos?often of cottonwood, softwood, or pine?were left unpainted; others were adorned with drapes and local paints and pigments; a tiny number were large, life-sized figures used during Holy Week processions, while others inclined towards the secular.13 Thus, the santo tradition was never static, and santeros engaged in nonartistic occupations such as farming in order to survive.14 From the begin ning, then, the santero "tradition" was shaped by the forces of a rapidly changing society: cultural mixing, aesthetic adaptation, and the search for economic survival. Barela must be placed within this context as a symbol of the changes occurring within the santero tradition and the wider Hispano commu nity. Born in Bisbee, Arizona, circa 1900, Patrocinio Barela was the son of a Mexican laborer who worked in the mining, lumber, and sheep ranching industries. Barela's mother died when he was a child and his sister also suffered an early death. His father, Manuel, moved to New Mexico where he worked as a sheepherder and a local curandero in the Taos Pueblo for the Native American Tiwa community. Barela left home at twelve years old and became an itinerant farm laborer, working as far afield as Wyoming and Colorado. After returning to Taos in the early 1930s, Barela married and began carving santos in 1931 from the local cedar wood. At the time, Barela was an outcast within the Hispano community: he drank, spent time in jail, and was deemed a fallen man by many in the community.15 There are many conflicting stories as to how and why Barela started carving. According to one account, Barela learned how to fix wood as an itinerant laborer and applied this knowledge to repairing a santo in 1931. Another version claims that witnessing a friend fixing a bulto inspired Barela to carve his own figures, which he then sold in the local store. At the time, Barela was working as a teamster for the WPA for $20 per month. In tandem with Taos artist Walter Ufer, local WPA official Ruth Fish discovered Barela's work, either at the local store or through Barela's direct attempts to sell his sculptures, and hired Barela onto the FAP at the end of 1935 at the paltry sum of $54 per month.16 It was however Barela's "discovery" by New Mexico FAP Direc tor Russell Vernon Hunter, an artist and administrator originally from Illinois, that shaped Barela's rise to regional and national prominence. Hunter's paternalistic intervention helped several Hispano artists gain regional and national acclaim: santero Juan S?nchez, who worked on</page><page sequence="5">Modernity and Mestizaje 45 the Portfolio of Spanish Colonial Design, and painter Pedro Cervantez, one of the few Hispanos to attain national recognition at MoMA's 1936 New Horizons in American Art show.17 Barela exhibited alongside Cerv?ntez at MoMA in 1936, and this show in particular propelled Barela from decorating churches and public buildings across New Mexico to national fame. Barela's work was highly represented amongst the 400 items and 171 artists on display Barela exhibited eight pieces, some of which harnessed religious iconography to secular themes.18 Although Barela exhibited at Washington, D.C.'s, National Museum of Art along side other FAP artists in November 1936, it was the MoMA exhibition that prompted Time magazine to declare Barela the "discovery of the year," thus securing his inclusion in the 1937 edition of Who's Who in American Art. Two more exhibitions in April and September of 1939 shored up Barela's status: Frontiers of American Art in San Francisco, part of the city's Golden Gate Exposition, and the American Art Today show at New York's 1939 World's Fair. Barela's Reception: New Deal Art and Americanism Barela's reception at the regional and national levels suggests how and why he came to represent several complementary discourses about art and Americanism during the New Deal. Positioned at the intersection of primitivism, Americanism, and pan-Americanism, Barela was elevated over many other Hispanos, being recognized as an artist rather than as an artisan. According to the New York Times (1936), Barela's work exuded a "crude, honest, personal expression." Time magazine lauded Barela for his "instinctive talent," while MoMA called Barela the "New Mexico Teamster Art sensation." Barela became the New Deal's "everyman"?the archetypal universal laborer-cum-artist who symbolized FAP's drive to democratize art.19 Barela was untrained?"an instinctive artist without education" whose work was rooted in the community, according to FAP National Director Holger Cahill.20 Barela's art, proclaimed sponsor Vernon Hunter, "is [so much] aroused by his experience of the every day that it forms a sort of allegorized autobiography of the artist. Pat Barela's work and thought are closely related to the simple patterns of his daily life, but there is in them always a search for the universal."21 Rooted in the popular and the everyday, Barela was perfectly positioned to</page><page sequence="6">46 &lt; Journal of the Southwest represent FAP's dictum?"art for everyman." Thus, he became a pivotal figure in Holger CahilPs drive for a "broader and socially sounder base for American art," and in the New Deal's wider quest for a pluralistic Americanism.22 Barela's position as symbol of folk regionalism only affirmed this status. In mediating economic depression and the contradictions of modernization, FAP elevated difference?the rural, the folk, the indig enous, and the regional?as opposed to homogeneity. This approach involved, as Rose declared, "looking backwards . . . and at the same time forwards," and mediating the ills of America's machine age with a rapidly vanishing "simpler" pattern of life.23 Regional art like Barela's became part of a wider American folk tradition that sprang from ethni cally distinctive centers like New Mexico as well as from the East Coast, and which typified the work of the self-taught. New Mexico became part of a wider canon, for as Hunter declared, a truly national art could only emerge by "integrating" regional differences and "diverse impulses" into a larger entity.24 Barela as "Modern Primitive" If Barela represented democratization, folk regionalism, and New Deal Americanism, he was also elevated as a "modern primitive." If the "crude, honest," and "instinctive" expression of Barela's sculptures made him an "everyman," this everyman was also, according to MoMA, "an early Romanesque sculptor [who had] strayed out of the eleventh century into the twentieth."25 But more than anything, critics compared Barela's work to the so-called primitive art of Africa, Asia, Oceania, and Mesoamerica. If the intersecting discourses of primitivism and folk regionalism affirmed Barela's art, they also placed it within a different time and space. Hunter, Donald Bear (director of FAP's Region 5), and Ina Sizer Cassidy (WPA writer and head of the Spanish Colonial Arts Society's Spanish Market) all labeled Barela a "natural, true primitive."26 For Hunter, Barela's work was primitive in terms of its "bold form" and "narrative."27 Barela's art did not express realism or an optical naturalism that derived from academic painting. Rather, his carvings displayed an "iconic content."28 Barela's sculptures were anthropomorphic?generally a face or a body, sometimes an animal, which was both real and recogniz able yet distorted. Barela's forms were described as stylized yet simplistic,</page><page sequence="7">Modernity and Mestizaje 47 abstract yet symbolic. At a time when European modernists integrated primitive art from Africa, Asia, Oceania, and the Americas into their own oeuvre?viewing sculpture as the most primitive of art forms?critics quickly discerned an affinity between the formal qualities of Barela's art and an evolving Western modernist aesthetic.29 FAP itself became imbued with this impulse through National Director Holger Cahill, who organized MoMA's American Primitives (1930) and American Sources of Modern Art (1933) exhibitions, which connected U.S. art with pre Columbian influences.30 Barela constituted a "link" to modernism rather than a modernist per se because his art was deemed primitive not simply in form but also in context. Although Hunter viewed santero art as a product of "exchange" between the "Christian and the pagan Indian," with the passage of time, santos became distanced from "tradition," and in turn, "primitive in feeling as well as in technique." Moreover, when santos were "not made for religious purposes," as in Barela's case, "they became entirely primitive," concluded Hunter.31 Divorced from academic training and ecclesiastical tradition (Barela rarely attended church), Barela became the timeless "primitive" whose lack of formal training encouraged the image of an artist moved by nature and intuition rather than by the modern trappings of status and materialism. Hunter's own vision of his prot?g? as "child-like," and in need of "guidance" and "protection" from tourists and "autograph seekers," simply reinforced this image.32 As Hunter declared, "school means an unlimited observation of natu ral phenomena. . . . With the inherent adaptability of his realistic race, [Barela] takes things as they are with a fatalism not less than oriental, but he meets them with unconquerable idealism and fortitude. Know ing little of life's tangible complications ... he is free from our national passion for accumulating things. But of natural philosophy, of timeless wisdom, he knows more than most persons gain through formal degrees . . . faith is axiomatic and life has reason."33 Barela's work, being untrained, was considered a vital expression of spirituality. As Hunter repeatedly claimed, Barela was not like other santeros who were merely "copyists."34 While Barela deployed a familiar religious iconography, his art bordered on ritual performance. Rooting Barela's art so deeply witxiin the world of Hispano religion simply affirmed the sense of the primitive for critics because the Anglo-American vision of Hispano Catholicism was already that of a faith lost in time, supersti tion, and the so-called archaic rites of confraternities such as the Order of</page><page sequence="8">48 &lt; Journal of the Southwest the Penitent Brothers. Barela himself drew inspiration from the moradas (chapels) and death carts used by the Penitent Brothers in Holy Week processions. Although Anglo artists employed Hispano religious motifs in their own work, they invariably viewed this faith as "mystical, na?ve, and primitive," and as the very essence of Hispano life itself.35 Thus, for Barela too, art, faith, and creativity became manifestations of ritual. It did not matter that Barela was "not an orthodox Christian": in the eyes of New Deal sponsors he remained "essentially religious."36 Mestizaje, Pan-Americanism, and the Universal In evaluating Barela's art, critic Douglas Hale noted that "others have seen various cultural origins in Barela's carvings: Moorish, Mayan, Aztec, Penitente, Navajo sand painting, Easter Island, early Christian."37 Thus, despite the search for the authentic and the noted affinities between Barela and so-called "tribal art" from other parts of the world, Barela's work was also distinctly hybrid: it was forged from a unique cultural synthesis over time, and as Wendell Anderson later observed, "out of the duality of Old and New World forms."38 Most significantly, Barela's synthesis was rooted firmly in the Americas. Contemporaries certainly viewed Barela's work?and New Mexico itself?as lying at the intersection of the Americas. If Barela's art was perceived as uniquely American in its everyday, popular appeal, it was also American by way of its cultural hybridity, which distanced it in time and space from European influences. Barela's art became part of a cultural nationalism but also of a wider, hemispheric nationalism?pan Americanism. The connection between Latin American art, Native American art, and cultural diplomacy during the late 1930s and early 1940s has been acknowledged.39 But few scholars have explored the relationship between Hispano art and pan-Americanism. The call for hemispheric solidarity through artistic expression derived momentum at the regional level from the historical specificities of New Mexico's ethnic and cultural landscapes. New Mexico lay at the center of a transnational relationship in reform and cultural policy during the 1920s and 1930s. As Suzanne Forrest notes, the Hispanic New Deal in New Mexico became entwined with the revival of Native American arts and with Mexico's cultural revolu tion and sponsorship of the popular arts. In Mexico, Anglo patrons and</page><page sequence="9">Modernity and Mestizaje 49 reformers found a perfect model for the preservation of Hispano and Native American culture.40 These links become more apparent when we consider that there was not simply an overlap in ideology but in personnel too. New Deal Indian Policy under John Collier developed from existing links with New Mexico and patrons in Santa Fe. Collier also looked to Mexican folk art when creating the Indian Arts and Crafts Board. Collier brought folk art specialist Ren? d'Harnoncourt north from Mexico to work on the board after d'Harnoncourt organized several key exhibitions of Mexican art in the USA during 1930.41 And it was d'Harnoncourt's exhibition of Mexican art that was deployed to improve intercultural relations in New Mexico. During 1931, d'Harnoncourt's Mexican art exhibit traveled to Albuquerque and Santa Fe with the support of the Mexican consul ate and with the aim of acknowledging the state's Hispano population and stimulating the preservation of Hispano arts through community art centers and vocational education. Writing to d'Harnoncourt, New Mexico Governor Arthur Seligman promoted Santa Fe in particular as "the largest center of this character in the United States," while the Albuquerque Morning Journal declared the city "the historic contact point between America and Mexico."42 Nina Perea Collier, a FAP state official and daughter-in-law of John Collier, worked for the Indian Bureau and later for the Office for Inter-American Affairs. Perea Collier noted the obvious connections between Latin American and Hispano arts but conceded that more effort could have been made to integrate Hispano culture into the government's pan-American initiative.43 Hunter and Cahill did however arrange for a traveling exhibition of Mexican children's artwork to be sent to New Mexico's Hispano community art centers, and in return, sent the Portfolio of Spanish Colonial Design for display across Latin America.44 New Mexico remained an important testing ground for intercultural relations into the 1940s. For Mexican American scholar J. Manuel Espinosa, the state's "harmonious combination" of indigenous, Spanish, and Anglo peoples made New Mexico "a significant laboratory of the Good Neighbor Policy."45 Although there are few direct references to Barela in terms of cultural diplomacy, Barela's art represented Espinosa's "true synthesis of the Americas." This perhaps explains Barela's position as one of the few sculptors to exhibit at the New York's World's Fair American Art Today show (1939). Barela's hybrid art forms comple mented the intercultural emphasis of the fair perfectly. Designed to</page><page sequence="10">50 &lt; Journal of the Southwest establish connections between old and contemporary cultural expression in much the same way that critics perceived affinities between primitive and modern art, the fair planned as one of its key themes and expositions the "cultural evolution and development of man in the three Americas" with the aim of "bringing the peoples of the Three Americas into a relationship of closer understanding."46 Indeed, conceived within this transnational perspective, the link between mestizaje and modernism becomes much more than incidental. As Tace Hedrick demonstrates, in Latin America a specific form of mes tizo modernism was formulated between 1900 and 1940, a modernism that considered "how to fuse, or hybridize, modernity and indigenous tradition" and how to blend regionalism, locality, and the vernacular with "a continental sense of'Americanism.'" Mirroring the interest shown in Barela's art, Latin America's mestizo modernism derived inspiration from rural, folk, and indigenous traditions: in this way, the "un-modern" would soothe the contradictions of modernity while being inserted into a forward- and future-thinking nation. According to Hedrick, Diego Rivera's pan-American hybrid aesthetic typified mestizo modernism in its bid to transcend the "seeming antinomies of modern life: the North and the South, the mechanical with the organic, the agrarian with the modern, and of course, the Indian with the Hispanic."47 If this modernism involved biological and cultural mestizaje, it also reflected the assumption of MoMA's American Sources and American Primitives exhibitions: that the modern and the un-modern could coex ist in one hemispheric space across time (albeit on an unequal footing). Barela must be understood within this framework of mestizo modernism, because it too impacted the United States as a distinctive form of mod ernism, one intimately tied to and resistant of the hegemonic forces of U.S. and European modernism. Moreover, during the 1920s and 1930s, Rivera's mestizo modernism filtered northwards through the "Mexican art invasion," described by Helen Delpar, to coincide with the U.S. desire for art that was both "untainted by academic [and European] modern ism and . . . [yet] indisputably 'modern.'"48 According to Gonzales and Witt, "Barela's aesthetic derives from the fault line where Latin American, Euro-American, and Native American cultures converge." This aesthetic mestizaje, which occurred at the local, regional, national, and transna tional levels, explains Barela's prominence during the 1930s and 1940s. As Gonzales and Witt declare, "No situation in time and place could have been more perfect for what he was destined to accomplish."49</page><page sequence="11">Modernity and Mestizaje &lt; 51 Barela as Modernist Folk regionalism, primitivism, and pan-Americanism were however all responses to a "crisis of modernity."50 These tendencies tell us more about Anglo needs?and about how "other" cultures might serve these needs? than about the changing position of Hispano culture in modern America. Moreover, because primitivism, Americanism, and pan-Americanism all searched for the universal in art?identifying similarities and affinities between distant groups?they elided differences, and in particular, the local, historical contexts and patterns of conflict and inequality that informed Hispano art. Lastly, these discourses denied Hispanos an active role in their own artistic development. As Tey Marianna Nunn claims, too often Hispano artists were "told" what their art should be, the key example being the Portfolio of Spanish Colonial Design, in which Hunter gave artists designs to copy.51 Barela, however, was no copyist. Barela must be viewed differently?as a modernist rather than as an object for New Deal anti-modernism or an example for those working within the framework of modernist primitivism. For Barela's art was a creative response to the fissures and possibilities of modernity, and to a series of cross-cultural encounters with patrons, the public, and the state. In this context, Barela assumes the position of a cultural intermediary, a transitional figure who shifted between different social and cultural worlds; and his carvings symbolize not the primitive, the traditional, or the authentic, but an "alternative hybrid modernism."52 Placing Barela within a modernist framework entails redefining modern and modernism. Positioning Barela as a modernist, particularly during the New Deal, might seem rather paradoxical given that the FAP was known for opposing modernism and abstraction as something distinctly foreign, European, un-American, and the product of artists who were alienated from society. Instead, the FAP celebrated realism, regionalism, and representational art. In existing formalist modernist narratives, the FAP constituted a distinct break from experimental modernism, which reflourished in an allegedly freer post-World War II climate and through abstract expressionism in particular.53 However, the chronological and geographical parameters of modernism and the narratives that prioritize modernism as emerging in a specific place and time demand revision. In relation to Aboriginal art in Australia, Ian McLean redefines modernism as a "broad church." "Instead of being narrowly focused on formal novelty and artistic autonomy," argues McLean, "the innova</page><page sequence="12">52 Journal of the Southwest tive aesthetic expressions of modernism are now understood in terms of their engagements with the wider social sphere of modernity"?a process that crossed time and space.54 My response to the term also draws upon recent studies of Native American art by Bill Anthes and Elizabeth Hutchinson, who place the emergence of modern Native American art within the context of intercultural relations. Native Ameri can artists negotiated different cultural worlds, and in turn, produced what Hutchinson calls a "transcultural aesthetic" and Anthes a "hybrid modernism."55 Similarly, Hedrick's analysis of a mestizo modernism in Latin America, which draws upon the "new modernist studies," forces us to reconsider modernism as emerging in different forms and seem ingly peripheral places. Modernism, concludes Hedrick, is "less a strictly esthetic or formal category and more a periodizing concept marked very broadly across the arts and across national boundaries by certain con cerns and characteristics."56 Thus, modernism encompasses not simply aesthetic form but new contexts, experiences, and relationships beyond "traditional" place and community. If we consider Barela's work along more conventional lines?in terms of formal qualities and the extent to which it shifts from realism towards abstraction?then his art does betray a modernist aesthetic. Despite its small size, Barela's work was described as monumental and "powerfully abstract."57 It was simple yet stylized, rhythmic, and self-referential, and Barela employed three-dimensional space to enact distortion in his work, particularly to emphasize the head. He was likened to the European modernists Moore, Picasso, Brancusi, and Modigliani. Contemporaries such as Hunter acknowledged that Barela departed from santeros such as Juan S?nchez, who reproduced traditional images. As Hunter claimed, "Barela in no strict way conforms to the old principles of santography. His carving ... is often connected with situations in contemporary life."58 But critics never evolved a suitable aesthetic "language" that acknowledged these qualities.59 Barela remained, not a modernist in the sense of directing contemporary art, but its opposite: someone with whom modern art found a "strange affinity."60 Barela remained doubly imprisoned by the New Deal vision of "true" American art as being opposed to Europe, and thus opposed to modernism, and by the generalized approach to Hispanos as a premodern, rural folk. As New Mexico's WPA administrator declared in 1937, "What we need here is not progress but preservation. We should not want New Mexico civilized in the same sense that our larger cities are civilized."61</page><page sequence="13">Modernity and Mestizaje &gt; 53 Gonzales and Witt suggest that Barela could be deemed a modernist on the basis that he influenced the Taos moderns after World War II and exhibited alongside them at La Galeria Escondida.62 Barela certainly influenced sculptor Ted Egri, who used Barela's sculptures for teaching his own students. He also knew Earl Stroh, who "screened" Barela's pieces before exhibition and sale; and Mabel Dodge Luhan, who "encouraged [Barela] to do his stump-type carvings and to work on a larger scale."63 Quite clearly, Barela's art was not what patron and photographer Mildred Tolbert described as an "isolated evolvement of the . . . santo-making tradition" born from "colonial and geographical isolation."64 However, Gonzales and Witt conclude that "Barela cannot truly be considered a modernist," for he was not "educated" in European modern ism, did not change the direction of art according to new "innovations" or by "consciously selecting aesthetics," and "had no conception of himself as an avant-garde artist."65 As recently as 2007, New Mexico Museum of Fine Arts Curator Joseph Traugott echoed these claims by declaring Barela beyond both the santero tradition and European modernism. "Since he had never seen examples of the style," adds Traugott, "Barela's work is best understood as the inventive creations of an 'outsider' artist whose works appeal to broad audiences."66 If we sanction these terms and the statement that "Barela's art stands apart from other art of his time," then we risk leaving Barela out of the narrative of American modernist art altogether.67 We also neglect viewing American modernist art as multicultural and intercultural. As Anthes notes, "many modernisms" shaped "multicultural America" and its art.68 Critics failed to recognize Barela's art in this vein because it was different and hybrid, and it destabilized the prevailing view of modernism as originating in urban America or Europe rather than in so-called traditional societies. We know that for Hunter and others, Barela remained an anomaly. Indeed, the slippages of Anglo primitiv ism and patronage suggest that aesthetic experimentation occurred over and above the creation of "traditional," "authentic" art. These slippages were imbued in the very term used to describe Barela ("modern primi tive"); in the opportunities that MoMA's and Cahill's deep investment in folk, decorative, and primitive art as "fine art" presented artists such as Barela;69 in the shared condition of migration, exile, and displace ment that motivated both Barela and his Illinois-born patron Hunter; and in Hunter's own contradictory attempt to preserve santero art while acknowledging its adaptation to secular and market forces. Indeed, for</page><page sequence="14">54 &lt; Journal of the Southwest Hunter, Barela was "the only resultant mystery" of the Hispano arts revival. As Hunter tellingly declared in 1942, "Some critics have been on the verge of calling [Barela] first among contemporary sculptors. To so place a simple man who has a direct power to philosophize, simply, through his own ego, would undoubtedly bring down the pillars of esthetic definition on any head so daring."70 If Barela's "art does not fit into standard art history categories," then modernism must be viewed on different terms. As Hutchinson notes, "Modern art... is more than a set of objects or a progression of styles ... it is a site of exploring what it means to be a 'modern.'"71 Barelas as "Transcultural Agent" Barela was not an isolated, timeless figure. Rather, he negotiated a series of cultural worlds and cross-cultural relationships. A mestizo born out side Taos, Barela lived with the Tiwa community when his father was a curandero, and with an African American family during his youth.72 If Barela produced for the Hispano community, he also produced for outsiders?for Anglo patrons, for a wider commercial art market, and for the state. Barela's art targeted different audiences beyond the reli gious, the Hispano, and the traditional; and as an artist and seasonal migrant laborer, Barela became deeply embedded in the market economy. Through these relationships and patterns of exchange, Barela's artwork circulated outside the church and community, as a secular commodity rather than as a devotional object. Barela often sold his work out of economic necessity and became acutely aware of the ways in which the arts revival accorded santos a new status. When his wife sold some of his bultos, Barela proclaimed, "More easy now than six or eight years ago." And when he won an art prize in New York under the patronage of Ruth Fish, Barela recalled: "Maybe she [Ruth Fish] will tell you what that piece mean. One hundred, twenty dollar price. I kept it. I don't think they pay me whole price."73 Barela also carved to suit Anglo tastes: he once made an image of a death cart and gave it to a local dealer, falsely claiming that it was a traditional piece.74 If Barela sold from secular and economic necessities, he remained acutely aware of his elevated status as an artist, as the 1936 self-portrait in which he depicted himself as a sculptor with a chisel and mallet in each hand, suggests. If Hunter lamented Barela's move towards an "external</page><page sequence="15">Modernity and Mestizaje &gt; 55 idea of himself in this particular piece, it certainly implied that Barela, as Hunter conceded, was "more aware of the status of his stuff than we might believe."75 If Barela viewed his art in economic terms, he also declared power and autonomy over its form, meaning, and circulation. As Barela declared: "The idea depend on the piece. When I get the piece I decide what I can do."76 Acknowledging the resistant quality of Barela's art, Hunter conceded: "it is exceedingly difficult for us to get titles for Barela's work. He is often so inarticulate that a good Spanish interpreter cannot pass his ideas onto us. He speaks, apparently, of things which are hard to grasp; and since his work, which harks of the saints, does not abide strictly in the precincts of the church, the fathers can not define them." In response to Hunter, FAP Director of Exhibitions Edith Halpert replied: "we have no titles or identification of any kind and since Barela's titles are so personal, we dare not make an arbitrary choice in the matter." Similarly, when Cahill asked Hunter to interview Barela for MoMA's New Horizons exhibition, Cahill admitted that "to get authentic material from Barela . . . will I know be difficult."77 The result was not an interview but an essay written by Hunter. Despite Hunter's paternalism, Barela used this power to negotiate the various art worlds in which he circulated. When approached by a Wash ington, D.C., commercial art dealer in 1940, Barela "was both sceptical and reluctant?and perhaps wise," noted Hunter. Responding to the dealer's request to buy, Barela allegedly replied: "The lady better come out and see them. If I bought a pair of shoes I'd want to see them first."78 Barela mediated these worlds without being co-opted or absorbed by them. Barela "had little contact with those who comprise[d] the Taos art colony," claimed Mildred Crews, and according to Hunter, "repeatedly refuse[d] to sell to tourists . . . retaining everything, far beyond Project production requirements."79 Although Barela claimed that he never saw his exhibitions at MoMA, New York, or San Francisco, in speaking to fellow santero Luz Mart?nez much later, he declared, "Anyway, in this world I already make my mark."80 Barela remained on the perimeter of several different cultural, social, and geographical worlds?Anglo, Hispano, and Tiwa, local, regional, and national?without being absorbed by any An itinerant laborer born outside Taos, Barela did not attend church and was already ostracized from that institution, which disapproved of his father's healing practices. Both the Hispano community and Barela's wife remained highly suspi cious of his art and its function. His wife "offered strenuous objections"</page><page sequence="16">56 Journal of the Southwest to Barela's art and allegedly sold several bultos on the advice of relatives who thought that they brought the family bad luck.81 Barela became a "hybrid figure," a "culture broker," and a "transcultural agent" whose work suggested "secrecy, cultural property, and transgression." Yet, as a peripheral character who resisted "categorization" and absorption, and who found his work "independently" of the Taos art colony as well as the church, Barela was by no means isolated from modernity. Rather, Barela's position as a "transcultural agent" allowed him to engage in modernity?to facilitate exchange with patrons and to "traffic in the very forces of modernization that would forever alter the community and culture."82 This "transcultural condition," and the intercultural relationships that went into making it, were crucial characteristics of modernity.83 Barela's carvings certainly suggest that "the forces of modernization" cut deeply into his own life. As "image[s] of survival and adaptation" that had subsumed various forms and meanings, Barela's sculptures typify this transcultural condition.84 Long before the Great Depression, New Mexico's Hispanos encountered the modernizing forces of cross-cultural contact?the arrival of Anglo settlers, homesteaders, and tourists, and the penetration of the market economy, land speculation, consumer goods, and large-scale ranching. Hispano farmers and sheepherders lost their land and grazing rights to outside forces. Many, like Barela and his father, turned to wage labor outside New Mexico?in the mines, beet fields, railroads, and timber industry of Colorado and Wyoming?to survive. This was the pattern of life for Barela, for his father before him, and for many Hispano men who periodically left their families and the community to earn a decent wage. The Great Depression simply exac erbated these trends.85 Produced in this context, Barela's santero aesthetic constituted a transcultural, hybrid aesthetic informed by the fissures of modernity. The santero tradition had never been static?early images experimented with style, relief, form, and secular themes. Barela's work however, shifted away from the devotional to embrace the secular more emphatically. And as Barela reframed religious iconography and thematic content, he experimented stylistically, distorting the human form and the head in particular, away from the representational towards the abstract. From the mid- to late 1930s, the bold, simplified three-dimensional figure and the multiple, distorted series of heads became more typical of Barela's oeuvre than his earlier religious-themed relief carvings. Exhibited alongside the</page><page sequence="17">Modernity and Mestizaje 57 Coronation of the Virgin and El Santo Ni?o during the New Horizons show, both Heavy Thinker (1936) and Hope, or the E our Stages of Man (1936) exhibit this trend (figures 1,2, and 3). Barela never dispensed with relief, however. Instead, he revisited and reworked this form in many of his wartime commissions, and by experimenting with relief, as in Angel de la Muerte (1936), extended the reach of the santero aesthetic beyond the traditional religious bulto. In particular, Barela's art evoked the cultural and socioeconomic schisms that disrupted existing patterns of community and identity. Barela saw Christ and God not within the confines of the church, but within his own struggle as a Hispano forced to migrate in search of work. This trend is evident in Barela's later piece O Save Me from My Sins (1955), in which the twisted figure of an old man "shout[ing] for salvation" is met by Barela's retort: "Christ say/you don't go to church to find Him/ you find Him anywhere." Similarly, in Hopes and Thanks to God, Barela asserts that faith is expressed in multiple forms for praying is "the way you feel/Not in the hands and arms."86 Instead of losing contact with faith and community, Barela reworked their meaning through artistic expression. Art allowed migratory, periph eral figures such as Barela to "talk to Jesus . . . without the help of the padre" and the anchor of the ethnic community.87 Angel de la Muerte (1936), for example, suggests that Barela was deeply conversant with the religious iconography of the Order of the Penitent Brothers, and the death cart in particular.88 Yet death, like other religious motifs in Barela's work such as the Holy Family, moved beyond the confines of church and doctrine to become a conduit for articulating new secular values and social conditions. In Woman Whose Baby Is Dead (1937), Barela subverts the iconic Virgin and Child dyad into a symbol of generational breakdown and his own fractured upbringing. Meanwhile, in Burial (1942), Barela experiments stylistically, fusing relief with his increasing preference for bold, three-dimensional faces. In time, the bold, simplified, and heavily distorted head?often one in a series?became the hallmark of Barela's three-dimensional figure, symbolizing a man "weighted by the problems of. . . family life" and a man "struggling to be himself."89 Barela referred pointedly to these burdens in Man Holding Up the World (1936). Nowhere is the tendency for stylistic and thematic experimentation more evident than in Barela's evocation of family and the self. Barela often shifted away from depicting the iconic Holy Family towards a secularized, this-worldly version reminiscent of his own upbringing.</page><page sequence="18">^afilli ^^VHHHHbHH??I^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ LEI Santo Ni?o (1936) Patrocinio Barela, El Santo Ni?o de Atocha, c. 1930s.

Barela's work was deeply personal. But in referring repeatedly to his family life, Barela alluded to wider social themes, and to the ways in which migration and uneven economic development disrupted communal and individual cohesion. Barela explained his self-portrayal in Heavy Thinker (1936) (figure 2) as a product of fragmentation: "my head, he is often in three or four sec tions, although he looks to be only one." This fragmentation recurs in Hope, or the Four Stages of Man (1936) (figure 3), where heavy-browed, hooded figures carved from a single piece of wood remain disconnected from one another. The final head is bowed, downcast, and isolated from the group. Barela's carvings evoked multiple meanings by blurring the distinction between the sacred and the secular, the communal and the individual, and the family and the self. Tellingly, Barela gave the very same self-portrait an alternative rendering and title during the 1950s; still staging a powerful evocation of conflict and personal testimony, Barela presented what he now called Four Figures, the Same Family as "four different minds/That cannot get along." "This I know ... in my own days," he added.90 Barela's personal testimony?the burden of migration and loss?is embedded here: his mother's early death; his lack of roots in the Hispano community; his struggle to support a family by straddling the worlds of artist, migrant laborer, and father without a stable income. We know that Barela earned less as a FAP sculptor than he did as a laborer, earn ing "about twenty dollars more each month [as a teamster] than the Art Projects paid," according to WPA records.91 Indeed, Barela left the FAP in 1939 to find seasonal work to supplement his income and, according to Hunter, went harvesting potatoes in Colorado.92 Images of fragmentation, conflict, death, and old age recur throughout Barela's oeuvre. The series from the 1930s entitled Village Life mirrored the burdens that Barela referred to in Man Holding Up the World (1936) and in his later piece, Everybody Has Got His Own Load (circa 1950s).93 In Village Life Barela deploys the qualities of the wood, and the knot in particular, to project the struggle of rural Hispano life: figures, both human and animal, crowd onto the base beneath the weight of the knotted wood above. The carving conveys a sense of the interminable as the figures revolving around the base suggest the cyclical nature of village life. And yet, in Barela's hybrid modernity, continuity was accompanied by change and conflict.</page><page sequence="20">60 &gt; Journal of the Southwest 2.

Witt, Spirit Ascen dant: The Art and Life of Patrocino Barela (Santa Fe: Red Crane Books, 1996). Reprinted with permission of the Museum of New Mexico Press and Harwood Museum of Art. Ultimately, we find the inspiration for Barela's art not in a formal education in the modernist vein but in an alterna tive modernity that impacted Hispano community and culture. In 1954, Barela referred to a conversation he had with Hunter: "He ask me many questions once. Where did you learn to carve? The artists in Santa Fe did not believe you did it without learning. ... I tell him, the life for a person in this world. How am I going to tell him? I learned going up the hill and coming down the hill. I learn in hard times and good times." In order to explain this to Hunter, Barela made a carving that represented morn ing, noon, and evening?the three ages of man?the last stage symbolizing, as Barela recalled, "a man crouched?a sick man. Man with sack on back my father pick up own medicine." The result was Barela's sculpture entitled Life (1939).94 This single statement demonstrates that Barela's modernity was ethnically and socially distinct from the one that Hunter knew and understood, a dif ference that Barela conveyed by carving his own visual language. That Barela had to explain himself in such a way implies that the modernity evoked in his work was a distinctly hybrid modernity.

Barela's art thus became a "visual mode of transculturation" and a way of finding a place in a new world.95 Nowhere is the desire to find a place in a new world more evident than in Barela's Man Who Stands by His Own (circa 1937) (figure 4). One fisted hand remains close to the figure's heart while the other, carved in the shape of a torch or flame, is held aloft. Barela embraces the stoutness of the wood, embedding the figure in the ground and fusing body and earth into one entity. Barela explained: "This man stands on his own ground/on his own particular place/in this world/with half closed eyes/and upraised arm/he declares this/This is what he holds/ which is his by natural right/received from above/This is his own/which is/what he stands by."96 Barela fuses the political rights of the secular world with those of the divine, because the "natural right" of man is sanctioned from above. By melding religious, secular, and collective visions of place and identity?a history of land loss, a call for resistance, liberty, and justice?with his own transcultural agency, Barela affirms a new consciousness. Perhaps it was Barela's "transcultural condition" as a hybrid figure on the margins of different social, cultural, and geographic worlds that compelled him to depict the "man who stands by his own" as a man who asserts his place in a modern world. Conclusion When America went to war, the FAP shifted its activities into the Graphic Section of the War Services Department. Barela's last government sponsored work included a series of wooden reliefs centered on war related themes and displayed at the National Museum of American Art in Washington, D.C. When the FAP ended, Barela lost his income and his market, and returned to seasonal work, sheepherding, potato pick ing, and mining in the surrounding states. Barela returned to Taos in 1951 where he carved santos until his death from a fire in his studio in 1964. Despite a brief "rediscovery" in the 1950s, when Barela died he was almost blind from cataracts and was close to poverty. Now that historians and contemporary santeros have "rediscovered" Barela,97 we must see beyond the aesthetic, anthropological, and political categories that placed his art within the confines of (anti-) modernism,</page><page sequence="23">Man TO?

Barela's work was a creative response to modernization?to new forms, relationships, and contexts, and to the multiple artistic, social, and cultural worlds in which he engaged. Barela's transcultural agency, and the transcultural aesthetic that derived from these new conditions, locate him firmly within a narrative of modernist art, for like the dis placed Anglo painters and patrons who came to New Mexico, he too deployed art as a way of finding a place in a modern world. If Russell Vernon Hunter and New Deal patrons took Barela out of his world, we must place him back there, because his art speaks of this changing context and cannot be fully understood without it. Ultimately, as Barela becomes a modernist he also becomes Holger CahilPs quintessential New Deal artist?but as an individual embedded in the conflicts of his time and place rather than as a primitive, timeless figure. Art, declared Cahill, "should be interwoven with the very stuff and texture of human experience, intensifying that experience, making it more profound, rich, clear, and coherent."98 In speaking of a new, hybrid modernity, Barela's carvings achieved just this. &lt; Notes 1.1 follow Tey Marianna Nunn in using the term Hispano to refer to Spanish speaking artists from New Mexico during the 1930s. See Nunn, Sin Nombre: Hispana and Hispano Artists of the New Deal Era (Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 2001). However, I do so from a historical perspective that reflects the term's evolution from a distinctive form of regional identity politics. According to Charles Montgomery and John Nieto-Phillips, Hispano became the preferred "public identity" within the Spanish-speaking community between the 1890s and 1920s over (and in opposition to) the racialized term Mexican. The Spanish-language press and the rico elite adopted the label in a bid to palliate racism, reclaim cultural ground on the basis of a shared regional ethnic identity, and assert their right to American citizenship and statehood. They did so by invoking a Spanish colonial identity in politics and culture through the terms Hispanoamericano or Spanish American, terms that also denied Anglos the right to appropriate the label American (and thus citizenship) solely for themselves. See Charles Montgomery, The Spanish Redemption: Heritage, Rower, and Loss on New Mexico's Upper Rio Grande (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2002), 14; and John M. Nieto-Phillips, The Language of Blood: The Making of Spanish-American Ldentity in New Mexico, 1880s-1930s (Albuquerque: Univer sity of New Mexico Press, 2004), 81-82. The term Hispano was also used by elite-born contemporaries such as Hispana educator, government official, writer, and folklorist Aurora Lucero-White, who used it to "denote a culture" and</page><page sequence="25">Modernity and Mestizaje 65 "persons of Spanish speech."

However, this debate has not yet been amplified into a full consideration of the variety of modernisms at work during this period, and Barela's reception is framed in terms of European modernism and America's interest in the "Primitive."
