<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NOTES THE CONCLUSION OF THE 1936 CAMPAIGN IN THE ATHENIAN AGORA THE current campaign of excavation in the Athenian Agora was concluded on June 13 after a period of twenty weeks of work. A brief report of the results achieved in the first part of the season was published in the June number of the JOURNAL; a summary of the accomplishments of the last nine weeks will be given here. Emphasis is laid again on the preliminary nature of this report, since during an active cam- paign little time is available for a study of the discoveries. Just as the first part of the season was distinguished by two notable discoveries, so in the latter period two objects are of outstanding interest and importance, an ivory statuette and a marble statue-base with the inscribed signature of Praxiteles. The rock of the Kolonos Agoraios is pierced with many wells and cisterns, some of which are interconnected by underground channels. Up to date, the presence of twenty-seven wells and of nineteen cisterns has been revealed in this area. In one of the wells pieces of an ivory statuette appeared in the mud at a depth of 15 m. Addi- tional fragments were secured from the deeper deposits and from several siftings of the earth from the well, until the total number exceeded two hundred. Since the head, an arm and a leg were included among the pieces first secured, it was at once apparent that the work was of the finest quality and the greatest care was exercised to prevent even the smallest fragment from being overlooked. The surface of the ivory was in an excellent state of preservation, and all pieces of the surface were found to make joins with one another so that eventually each was fitted into its original position. The pieces were cleaned with alcohol, treated chemically, and put together with great care and patience by the members of the staff. The result is the figure shown in Fig. 1, which is complete except for the thumb and one finger of the right hand, a small part of the centre of the body, and a few fragments elsewhere. The missing parts have been restored in beeswax for the purpose of furnishing a support for the frame of the body as well as of providing a mild preservative for the ivory. The statuette, which is 30 cm. high, portrays the figure of a youth, who is shown standing in an attitude of repose with the weight of the body borne on the right leg and with the left knee slightly flexed. He has raised the right arm above the head with an easy gesture letting the wrist rest lightly on the top of the head. The relaxed position of the exquisitely carved fingers is admirably rendered. The left arm is extended and the fingers are bent, indicating that some object was held in the hand. The figure was carved from a single piece of ivory except for the left arm which was made of a separate piece attached by a dowel to the upper arm. The clean-shaven face has an oval shape with rather full cheeks; the brow is given a triangular appear- ance by the arrangement of the hair; the eyelids are sharply cut and the lips incline somewhat to thickness. The hair is arranged in distinctive fashion with a double lock crowning the central parting. It is bound by a ribbon which is looped at the back to hold in place the long curls, the ends of which fall out behind over the band.

LESLIE SHEAR FIG. 1.--IVORY STATUETTE OF APOLLO LYKEIOS</page><page sequence="3">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NOTES 405 locks of the hair are skilfully and delicately carved with varying depth of incisions so as to give a realistic wavy effect to the whole. The delineation of the back is a delight to the eyes. The fingers and toes have been rendered with infinite care, and no small- est detail of execution has been overlooked. The work is a triumph of classical tech- nique wrought by a master hand. The pose of the figure associates the statuette with a well known type of statue that has been identified as Apollo Lykeios from a description given by Lucian which is in agreement with the appearance of a miniature copy on some Athenian tetra- drachmas. Lucian, when making casual reference to the Lykeion of Athens, which contained a sanctuary of Apollo as well as a gymnasium and a philosophical school, describes the statue of the god as a figure leaning against a column, holding a bow in the left hand and with the right arm placed above the head in the attitude of repose after strenuous effort. The position of the fingers of the left hand are suitably ar- ranged for grasping a bow but no pieces of such an object were found. Since the left hand does not retain any traces of metal stain the bow may have been made of gold or of thin pieces of ivory which have not been recovered. A small circular ivory base, carefully made in the same technique as that of the statue, was found with the pieces, but this cannot be definitely identified as belonging to an adjoining column. Some discoloration, however, on the back of the upper left arm and shoulder seems to mark the spot where the figure was in contact with the column. Lucian does not mention the name of the sculptor who made the statue of Apollo in the Lykeion, but its use on Athenian New Style coins and the many copies of it that were made in Roman times are sufficient evidence that it was a famous work. The stylistic study of the figure, based on the mediocre Roman copies, has led some scholars to attribute the statue to Praxiteles, or to his immediate circle. The ivory statuette abundantly confirms this attribution. The head resembles the head of the Aphrodite of Knidos in all essential characteristics, such as the delicate treatment of the locks of the hair, the fulness of the cheeks, the triangular shape of the forehead, the sharp cutting of the eyelids, the form of the lips, and the rounded contour of the chin, but the Apollo far surpasses in technique and beauty any preserved copy of the Aphrodite and from it one can appreciate more fully Lucian's praise of the hair, the forehead and the finely penciled eyebrows of the Knidian goddess. The body of the Apollo, too, is no less worthy of eulogy than is the head, and to it may be appropri- ately applied many of the enthusiastic appraisals of the Hermes of Olympia. The balance and poise of the resting figure, the splendid modelling of the muscles with the interplay of light and shade over the uneven surfaces, the soft contours and sweeping curves of the body, the infinite care in the rendering of details like fingers and toes, the grandness of the conception as a whole are all characteristics of the style of Praxiteles. The well in which the ivory was found is located on the hilltop southwest of the little temple of Apollo Patroos which was erected in the latter half of the fourth cen- tury B.C. In front of that temple stood the statue by Kalamis of Apollo Alexikakos whose attribute was the bow, and evidently the dedication in this temple of the type of the Lykeios would not have been inappropriate. We have no record that Praxiteles ever worked with ivory, but we know from the accounts of the famous gold and</page><page sequence="4">406 T. LESLIE SHEAR ivory statues that the noted sculptors of Greece were familiar with this technique. The statuette is the work of a great master of the period. May not that master have been Praxiteles himself who, commissioned in his old age to make a statue for the newly erected temple of Apollo Patroos, produced this exquisite ivory replica of the statue of Apollo which he had previously made for the Lykeion? Another important discovery associated with Praxiteles is a statue-base which bears his signature (Fig. 2). The block of Pentelic marble is L-shaped with mouldings at the top and bottom. The length on the front face is 1.35 m., the width on the left FIG. 2. -BASE WITH THE SIGNATURE OF PRAXITELES side is 0.665 m., on the right side, 0.24 m. The block was broken on the left side when a modern drain was laid there sometime in the last century, but many of the pieces were recovered from the wall of the drain. The base bears an inscribed dedication to Demeter and Kore by Kleiokrateia, daughter of Polyeuktos the Teithrasian, and wife of Spoudias. The inscription in beautifully carved letters is arranged on the stone with the names of the goddesses in the centre at the top and the names of the dedicator and her family in a column on the right side, with the signature of Praxit- eles in smaller letters below them. The left side seems to have remained blank as no letters have appeared on the recovered pieces of that end of the block. The wall into which the base had been built is dated in the first century B.c., and was probably con- structed in the course of the rehabilitation of the city after the attack of Sulla in 86 B.C. Pausanias (I, , 4) says that in the temple of Demeter which was near the Pom- peion, and thus not far from where the base was found, were statues of Demeter, her</page><page sequence="5">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NOTES 407 daughter and Iakchos, and that an inscription on the wall in Attic letters stated that they were works of Praxiteles. The newly found base block had been rejected pre- sumably because of some injury at the time of the destruction wrought by Sulla, and so could not have been seen by Pausanias, but the inscription may well have been transcribed in archaistic letters of the first century from the base to the wall of the temple. It is probable that the statues by Praxiteles seen in the neighboring temple by Pausanias are to be associated with this base, and it is unnecessary to seek further for an hypothetical elder Praxiteles because of Pausanias' reference to the Attic letters. The family of the dedicators is known to us from the XLIst oration of Demos- thenes, a brief of very human and modern type for a litigant in a family quarrel and lawsuit over an inheritance. The speech was written about the year 361 B.C. for the husband of the elder of the two daughters of Polyeuktos, who had brought suit against his brother-in-law Spoudias, husband of the younger daughter Kleiokrateia, claiming an unfair division of the estate of the father Polyeuktos. Besides the signa- ture of Praxiteles the inscription provides two new items of information: the name of the younger daughter and the deme of the father. The name of the deme necessi- tates an emendation in the text of Demosthenes, XLI, 3, where the phrase HIoXVEvKTro yap i~' 7r Optatoo must be changed to read HOXi6EVK70T Y dP 7' TEtOpdotoo. Three other inscribed statue-bases are of considerable interest. One of these is a heavy block of Pentelic marble that is broken on all sides, but bears on the front a partly preserved dedication to Hadrian Olympios. It was found in a late wall in Eponymon Street, 45 m. east of the place of discovery in 1931 of the statue of Hadrian, and about halfway between that place and the spot where the leg of the statue was found this season. Because of its great size and weight it is improbable that it was carried far from its original location and, therefore, it seems possible that this is to be associated with the Hadrian statue. The second base, made of Hymettian marble, has a cutting in the top for the small foot of a bronze statue. On the face of the block the left end of an inscription is preserved which records the dedication by the Boule to a certain Leukios. The letters have the shapes characteristic of the Augustan period, and this fact, together with the incised name and with the size of the foot, makes it probable that this is the base of the statue of Lucius Caesar which was erected in the Roman Agora. The third base is also associated with the family of Augustus. This is a large block of Hymettian marble that is preserved on all sides and has on the top the cuttings for the feet of a bronze statue. A dedication, written across the front in four lines of carefully made letters, states that the Council of the Areiopagos honors Julia Augusta Boulaia, mother of Tiberius Augustus. Livia, mother of Tiberius and wife of Augustus, assumed the title Julia Augusta at the death of Augustus in 14 A.D. We learn from this base that she was honored by the Athenians with a bronze statue. The title Boulaia may indicate that she was ritually associated with Athena Boulaia, whose statue stood in the Bouleuterion, which is located a short distance west of where the base was discovered. An important piece of sculpture from a well on the Theseion plateau is the head of a woman with part of the neck preserved, made of Parian marble (Fig. 3). The head</page><page sequence="6">00 cj:3 cj:( FIG. 3.--HEAD BELONGING TO EPHEDRISMOS GROUP FIG. 4. -EPHEDRISMOS GROUP WITIH HEAD ATTACHED</page><page sequence="7">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NOTES 409 is bent back and is turned to the right. The features have a strained expression and the lips are contracted with three teeth showing. The impression given by the piece is that of a woman who is making some great effort. The hair is arranged low on the brow where it is bound by a band that encircles the head. The hair on the right side of the head at the back is unfinished and the right cheek is smooth, whereas the left side was finished and is much weathered. This points to a position in a pediment or some similar structure where the inner side of the figure would not have been seen but would have been better protected than the outer. The marble, weathering, workmanship, style and size are identical with those of the group of two women, one carrying the other, the so-called Ephedrismos, that was found in 1934 in a well which was cut in the rock below the east front of the Theseion. The neck of the statue is chipped about the edges so that there is no point of contact between the two pieces, but it is certain that the head belongs to the figure of the woman who is bearing the burden on her back, and it has been attached to that body - as is shown in Fig. 4. The group closely resembles in style and technique the figures on the frieze of the Theseion and it is tempting to suggest that temple as its provenance. From the same well came a bronze statuette of a bull together with the base on which it stood (Fig. 5). The bull (length, 0.09 m.) has his head tossed back in angry mien, and his right foreleg raised as if he were about to charge. In spite of the corrosion it is possible to appreciate the care and realism with which the work is made. Another well on the Kolonos Agoraios produced a marble statuette of the Mother of the Gods which is of familiar type but is unusual because of its good state of preservation (Fig. 6). Only the left forearm is miss- ing but the face is marred by an iron stain on the mouth. The goddess is seated on a throne that has heavy rectangular sides and a solid back that diminishes in width towards the top. On her right side, and forming the front of that side of the throne the forepart of a lion is carved. The goddess wears a low polos, beneath which the hair is parted in the middle and is brushed back in waves on each side, with a long curl hanging down on either shoulder. She is clad in a chiton which is fastened by a girdle around the waist and over that she has a long himation that passes from the left arm over the left shoulder, across the back, and is then brought over the lap in full graceful folds with the ends hanging down beside the left leg. The right arm is extended along the right side of the throne and the hand held a patera. FIG. 5.- STATUETTE OF BRONZE BULL</page><page sequence="8">410 T. LESLIE SHEAR The left arm is similarly extended on the left side and the missing hand probably held a kymbalon. The figure has great dignity, and the shape of the head and the treatment of the drapery are wholly Pheidian in style. It may be regarded as a close copy of the cult statue made by Pheidias for the Metroon. The same well produced another object which is of particular interest for the chronological evidence it supplies. A large undecorated amphora has an exact date written on its shoulder in painted letters of cursive script, reading: In the 14th year FIG. 6. - MARBLE STATUETTE OF MOTHER OF GODS FIG. 7.- STATUETTE OF APHRODITE of Hadrian, the archonship of Lysiades. Dating by the era of Hadrian began in Athens in 124 at the time of the first visit of Hadrian to the city. The pot thus is dated in 137/138 A.D., which gives the year of the archon Tiberius Claudius Lysiades, which had not been previously known. The chronology is important for the type of pottery on which the inscription is written and for the other objects associated with it in the same well. These inexhaustible wells have also produced other statuettes. One of them is a figure of Aphrodite that is complete except for the head (Fig. 7). The surface of the marble has the polished and alabaster-like finish of works of the second century A.D., and this date is indicated by the type of lamp in the same stratum. The god- dess, who is standing on a base with the weight on the left leg and with the right</page><page sequence="9">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NOTES 411 knee bent, is nude except for a cloak which she holds in front of her with her right hand. This is brought diagonally across the back and on the left is held between the left elbow and the side of the figure, the ends hanging down to the ground. The left hand is pressed against the breasts. By the left side of the goddess is a dolphin in vertical position with its head down. The lamps found with the statuette belong to the Type XXVII of the second FIG. 8.-LAMPS AND LEAD CURSE TABLET FRoMi A WTELL century A.D., and several of them have the names of the makers stamped on the bottom. One signed Preimou is decorated on the disc with a winged Eros, another signed Sposianou has on the disc a leopard charging to the right, another by Phthon- gos is decorated with a mounted youth who is brandishing a spear, and an un- signed example has a helmeted head of Athena on the disc. With these was also found an anthropomorphic lamp in the shape of a baby's head with the filling-hole in the top of the head and with the handle extending from the forehead; the mouth served as a wick-hole, as in the case of the negro-head lamp that was lying at a higher level in the same well (Fig. 8). Pottery of many different periods has come from the various sections of the area. A small deposit of sixth century ware came from a shallow well located below</page><page sequence="10">412 T. LESLIE SHEAR the Kolonos Agoraios. One of the vases is a late black-figured lebes gamikos that is largely preserved and is reproduced with its restorations in Fig. 9 from a water-color by Piet de Jong. The base is decorated with three groups of two women each, seated on stools facing each other, doing sewing or knitting with the material hanging down into a basket between them. The lebes itself has on its side a scene showing a winged woman running to the right away from Hermes, who stands in front of a pair of horses. Beyond the Nike, or Iris, is a series of seven women walking to the right, holding baskets on their heads. The cover is knobbed and is decorated with linear designs arranged in con- centric bands. Numerous miscellaneous objects of interest are included among the dis- coveries. Three additional lead curse tablets (tabellae defixionum) were taken from wells. One of these was open when found, another was so loosely rolled that it was readily opened, but the third is tightly folded and will be opened with difficulty as the metal has been partially converted into carbonate of lead, which crumbles easily. The script is well pre- served on the two open tablets and eventually they will be entirely legible. A deposit of more than a. hundred lead seals was lying on a late Roman stratum in a restricted area in front of the north end of the Stoa of Attalos. These give types of various gods, Zeus, Athena, Poseidon, Asklepios, and many of them are countermarked with the stamp of a cock. They were found near the small circular building in Section Sigma and may be of significance for the interpretation of that building, for the identification of which no clue has yet been discovered. The hoard of inscriptions continues to grow in size and importance and the new pieces are constantly providing valuable information on the Attic calendar and on Athenian history in general. Other groups of objects, such as coins, lamps, and terra- cottas, have also been greatly enlarged by the discoveries of the year. Besides the individual discoveries steady progress has been made with the elucida- tion of the topography of the area. Six new buildings have been located, and partially uncovered, but pending their further excavation and investigation, no identifications of them are suggested. These buildings appear on the restored ground plan of the Agora shown in Fig. 10. North of the Theseion and of the railway below it, a long FIG. 9.-- LEBES GAMIKOS. PARTLY RESTORED.

LESLIE SHEAR stoa was uncovered that borders an ancient street on the south (No. 3 on Plan). This street lies south of the main street to the Dipylon and is almost parallel to it. Important for the topography of this corner of the Agora was the discovery of the southeast corner of the north wing of the Stoa of Zeus, which permits the exact restoration of the plan of that building (No. 4). Northeast of the Theseion lies a rectangular building for the location of which the rock was partly cut away (No. 2). It has strongly buttressed walls and two interior rows of columns. A long narrow structure of stoa shape is located south of the "South Stoa" (No. 16). A heavy wall forms its south side, while on the north it has a colonnaded facade. The evidence points to the Hellenistic period as the date of its construction. The poros foundations of a building of the sixth century B.c. were partly cleared in the southeast corner of the area (No. 19), and in the northeast appeared walls of a large square structure which extend beneath the Stoa of Attalos (No. ~2). This building seems to have been destroyed some time before the Stoa was erected. A small circular building was placed directly over one of its west walls in the late Roman period (No. 23). These buildings will be further investigated in the next campaign and excavation will be conducted in six additional city blocks. T. LESLIE SHEAR PRINCETON UNIVERSITY</page></plain_text>
