<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTICES OF BOOKS It is a pity that the author of a textbook on Greek sculpture can ignore specialists in the field, provided that the opinions of art historians and literary historians, particularly those slightly out-of-date, as well as of German philosophers of the Enlightenment, are quoted and discussed. Accuracy is not a requirement and statements are written from memory without checking facts at any stage. A textbook thus littered with inaccur- acies can be original enough to represent the post- modernist view of a well-worn topic, especially when packaged by a respectable publisher. Caveat lector. The quest for originality at all costs, the conclusions drawn on the basis of out-of-date information, and the cavalier treatment of facts can damage your health. OLGA PALAGIA University of Athens KYRIELEIS (H.) Der Grosse Kuros von Samos. (Deut- sches Archaologisches Institut: Samos 10). Bonn: Habelt, 1996. Pp. xi + 130, 48 pl. DM 110. 377492- 7715. Kyrieleis's eagerly-awaited publication of the great Ischys kouros from Samos does not disappoint. Lucid and thorough, it offers perceptive studies of the statue's date, style, inscription sources, and meaning. Forty-eight excellent black-and-white plates present differently-lit views and comparanda ranging from Naukratite statu- ettes to Egyptian pharaohs. In the 1920s Buschor found fragments of two colossi at the Heraion, including one huge pair of thighs and another thigh bearing Ischys's inscription. K. takes up the story with his unearthing of Ischys's giant headless torso in 1980, which joined the inscribed thigh and more of Buschor's fragments, and of the lucky discovery of its face in 1984. Next, its base, c. 5.25 m. (10 Samian cubits) square, is discussed by H. Kienast. K. then describes the kouros itself. Close observation reveals that it twists slightly on its axis: hips to the right, following the stride, and chest to the left. Subtler differences pervade the individual muscles and features. K. refrains from placing all this within the overarching schemes proposed by Kleemann and others, but given the thrust of his later chapters, he will be pleased to know that in Egyptian Sculpture of the Late Period, Bernard Bothmer observed similar distortions there too. Paint traces and uneven weathering betray a once thoroughgoing polychromy. Patches of now-blackened pigment on the thigh and elsewhere show that the body was once entirely coloured, presum- ably with a red-brown tan to hide the marble's striking blue veins that so delight many a moder viewer. Painted details included ornamentally-trimmed pubic hair, rosette-shaped nipples, and annular irises; the lips and eyebrows were presumably painted too, and a line above the upper lip suggests a moustache. K. argues that the sculptor's grid was based on the Samian cubit of 52.5 cm (derived from the Egyptian royal cubit: Hdt. 2.168). Though the feet are lost, he estimates the figure's height at 9 1/6 cubits, rounding this up to 10 by restoring an (also lost) plinth, and thus inscribing statue and base into a 10-cubit square. Yet the grid's lack of correlation with some major anatomical features (the nipples, for example, fall in the middle of a square) counsels caution, as does the fact that Eleanor Guralnick has recently proposed another, entirely different grid with about the same degree of anatomical correlation (AA [1996] 502-26). After an excursus by G. Neumann on the inscription (translated as 'Ischys dedicated [me/it], son of Rhesis'), K. turns to the statue's style and date. He places it around 590, somewhat earlier than usual, and contem- porary with the Sounion-Dipylon workshop and the Twins in Delphi. Its relocation to the beginning of Samian marble sculpture only complicates the question of origins (61). Where and how did its sculptor lear his trade? A fragmentary kore from the Heraion in Naxian marble and style suggests Naxos or at least the Cyclad- es, which had been producing such statues for a gener- ation. Yet though our man may have learned his tools there, he betrays none of the sub-Daedalic bias of contemporary Cycladic or mainland style, and seventh century Samian Kleinkunst is too formless to provide an alternative. So K. looks to Egypt, where he finds parallels for the hair, knees, arms, and some other features in Dynasties XII, XIX-XX, XXV-XXVI, and on kouroi from Naukr- atis. The Sesostris and Ramses colossi at Tanis and Memphis, at least, were still visible around 600, and K. believes that our sculptor must have seen them. But did he do more? K. argues that he did. Repeating his previously- published view that kouroi are fundamentally heroic, or at least exemplify heroic-style arete, he proposes that since heroes were supposedly huge (10 cubits on one estimate), a colossus like Ischys's probably portrayed one. (Although no inscribed kouros names a hero, the force of local tradition would have made this unnecess- ary.) And since it is unlikely that some kouroi were generic and some not, all were probably specific (97). Then comes the boldest thrust of all. This concept itself is Egyptian, for the Greeks who went to fight, trade, and tour in XXVIth Dynasty Egypt would have been struck not by Egyptian figure types per se, still less by knees and elbows, but by the Egyptian conception of the anthropomorphic stone colossus as Monument (110). They identified its subjects-Cheops, Sesostris, and so on-as the Egyptian equivalents of the heroes (115). Yet, despite borrowing concept, grid, scale, and some ana- tomical details, the kouros remains essentially Greek, a form appropriated and transformed, not slavishly repro- duced. So just as R.M. Cook occupies one corer of the Greece-Egypt controversy ('Origins of Greek sculpture', JHS 87 [1967] 24-32), K. stands resolutely in the other-and will no doubt soon take his knocks as well. Though my precis does scant justice to his wide-ranging and subtle thesis, sceptics will challenge his comparanda (he omits Phoenicia and Assyria, where the face of Ischys's kouros seems more at home); his mechanisms of transmission (exports? tourism? apprenticeships in Egyptian workshops?); and his interpretation of the kouros itself (contrast e.g., Sourvinou-Inwood's nuanced discussion of it as sema in Reading Greek Death). And what of the assumption that one can have it both ways, that an object can be thoroughly Greek despite such a parcel of borrowings? For-as a perceptive student from 247</page><page sequence="2">NOTICES OF BOOKS Germany has remarked to me-where does borrowing end and transformation begin? And if transformation is so total, how can one isolate its sources? Yet K.'s recognition that all borrowing is done under a description, to quote Richard Wollheim (e.g., 'Egyp- tian colossus as Monument; as Hero; as Man; as Canon; as Anatomical Textbook;' or whatever), and that all borrowings import some part of their context, is no small step forward. Like the rest of this handsome and provocative monograph, his proposals blaze a new trail in the study of the genre, one that we will be exploring for a long time to come. ANDREW STEWART University of California at Berkeley ROGGE (S.) Die Attischen Sarkophage: Erster Faszi- kel. Achill und Hippolytos. (Die Antiken Sarkophag- reliefs 9.1.1). Berlin: Mann, 1995. Pp. 169, 112 pl. DM 180. 3786118523. This is the first volume in the ASR series to deal specifically with Attic sarcophagi: Rogge focuses on the typology, iconography and chronology of sarcophagi decorated with two of the more popular mythological themes, Achilles and Hippolytos. In both cases second- and third-century sarcophagi are considered separately, as a distinct change around AD 200 is suggested. Rather than discussing the sarcophagi as whole units, R. considers the scenes used on fronts, short sides and backs separately, as the faces of Attic sarcophagi had a decided hierarchy of importance. Early sarcophagi (last quarter of the second century) present the main mytho- logical theme on the front and main short side only, with unconnected mythological scenes or decorative motifs (such as garlands or sphinxes) on the lesser side and back. Themes used at first on the front might be demoted to the sides or back as they lost popularity. Scenes concerning Achilles are divided into two groups: Achilles at Troy (the ransoming and dragging of Hect- or's body, the laying-out and mourning of Patroklos, the arming of Achilles before Thetis), and Achilles' youth (especially his discovery among the daughters of Lyko- medes on Skyros and his education by Chiron). There are also single occurrences of other themes, such as the weighing of Hector's body on the back of a sarcophagus at Woburn Abbey. On second-century Hippolytos sarcophagi, the main scene, on the front, depicts Hippo- lytos and Phaedra occupying opposite ends of the frieze with their companions, with the shrine of Artemis in the centre: Hippolytos watches a servant nailing antlers to the shrine, recalling his hunting interests, while the presence of Aphrodite and Eros near Phaedra indicates her rather different preoccupations. In the third century, further episodes from the story are used on the sides and backs, such as the boar hunt, Hippolytos' fall, and other scenes of Theseus, Hippolytos, Phaedra and the nurse, which are more atmospheric than narrative. On the fronts of third-century sarcophagi, Hippolytos and his hunting companions begin to dominate and eventually oust Phaedra and her female group on to the short side. On the Achilles sarcophagi, too, there is the same diminishing of the female presence with a growing aesthetic preference for tightly-packed rows of naked youths, and for a centralised and symmetrical composi- tion. This results in a loss of narrative meaning towards the middle of the century, though on Hippolytos sar- cophagi at least Phaedra does return to the front on two very late sarcophagi. Such conclusions must, of course, be underpinned by a secure chronological framework. R. devotes specific sections to the question of dating sarcophagi within the second century, but, curiously, not to those she assigns to the third century. There are few fixed chronological points. Much of the dating is based on the tectonic structure of the sarcophagi (crucial for dating before/after c. AD 180 is whether the sarcophagus appears to have had a roof-shaped or a kline lid), on style, and on the supposed iconographic development of the various scenes. R. uses this last criterion with assurance but nevertheless leaves doubts as to its validity as an indication of absolute dates: her typological analysis of the iconography of the scenes is convincing, but the direct translation of this into a chronological sequence is not self-evident. R. devotes her final section to exploring the artistic sources used by the Attic workshops for the various scenes, considered one by one. In very few cases does the sarcophagus-maker appear to have copied a complete composition from another source: more often, individual figures and small groups were brought together into new compositions, and figure-types were adapted for different mythological characters (for instance the boar-hunt scene was used for both Hippolytos and Meleager). R. doubts that the Attic workshops used pattern-books, but tentatively explores the possibility that plaster casts and terracotta copies of metalwork were important in the transmission of figure-types and groups. She clearly demonstrates how designs developed and related to one another within the Attic workshops, but is rather vaguer on the question of where the Attic figural repertoire came from in the first place. Also touched on, but not fully explored, is the relationship of Attic sarcophagus design with that of sarcophagi made in Rome. All in all, this is a useful addition to ASR: not only does it provide (as one would expect) a full catalogue (of 73 pieces, 46 Achilles, 27 Hippolytos) and excellent photographs, it also analyses these sarcophagi in a way which must form a starting point for all future studies of Attic sarcophagi. My only criticism is that the study concentrates on typology and iconography without any consideration of why these themes might have been chosen in the first place.
