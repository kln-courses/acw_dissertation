<plain_text><page sequence="1">Some remarks on a theory of research in the work of Aristotle AANT ELZINGA Summary Attention to criticism and growth! It appears Aristotle had a dialectical method with two main phases: a) doxographic induction ? a form of re-collecting ideas of previous generations; it is related to Plato's anamnesis, b) organisation of knowledge by classification (taxonomy); it is natural in view of Aristotle's organismic outlook. Against common misconceptions: Aristotle was not anti-empirical, nor anti-critical (dogmatic). Doxographic induction is a prime example of critical and "empirical" methodology. Against Popper: Aristotle's subscription to the ideal of certainty (episteme) is not the main source of dogmatism in the Aristotelian paradigm. A theory of science has to take cognizance of social settings, how these support or repress critical dialectical method. Against Feyerabend: Galileo's use of re-collection (methodological anamnesis) in his dialogues is not trick persuasion; it is a continaution of an old method, viz., doxographic induction. Granted that it has always had persuasive as well as other psychological aspects. It serves the double function of giving clues, and leading the mind into the frame of a paradigm. Finally, it is proposed that theory of science and classical scholarship must sometimes call on each other, just like theory of science and history of science. 1. A NOTE ON RATIONAL RECONSTRUCTION OF "THEORIES OF RESEARCH"1 To a considerable extent my discussion will revolve around a rational reconstruction of aspects of a "theory of research". Now the question may arise, is it possible to make such a reconstructed partial theory of research that may be plausibly attributed to e. g. Aristotle ? And is it a legitimate task for meta-science to attempt such ? Yes, I think it is not only legitimate but also desirable to make rational reconstructions of theories of research of great innovators. The practical possibility is to some extent limited by the background of the student of meta-science himself. In my case I am unable to work directly from the classical source material. Nevertheless I think that in our field, the theory of science, we should also be bold enough to make likely guesses and conjectures. Nor will these be wild speculations. For on the one hand I thank Dr. A. Ziggelaar of the Royal Danish School of Education, Copenhagen, for his helpful criticism of an earlier draft of this article. 1 See also my "Huygens' theory of research and Descartes' theory of knowledge", this journal II/2, 1971 und III/l, 1972. There is also a discussion of problems connected with the method of historical case study. A more detailed discussion of such problems is found in Aant Elzinga, On a research program of early modern physics, with special reference to the work of Chr, Huygens (University of Gothenburg, 1971 ? stencil). Zeitschrift fiir allgemeine Wissenschaftstheorie V/l (1974) ? F. Steiner Verlag GmbH, Wiesbaden, BRD</page><page sequence="2">10 Aant Elzinga some classical scholars and historians have already done spade work among the documents which we have to start with. On the other hand the meta scientist is guided by his own insight into the research process in general, and this serves as a kind of pre-understanding in every single case where he approaches the work of a particular research worker in aim to elicit something concerning research procedure. Now it is clear that the conjectures arrived at must also be checked from the same two sides. Further historical scholarship will have to be done by persons versed in e.g. the Greek classics in order to check such reconstructions as the meta-scientist may make. Other students of meta science, perhaps from different contemporary metascientific platforms, will be able to bring out weaknesses and difficulties on the theoretical side. This is to be expected and welcomed, for it is our conviction that also in our own field, criticism and theoretical wrangling is the lifeblood of growth. It is a precondition for a symbiosis of the theory of science with other fields. I have to some extent founded my resonstruction in the present paper on the work of professor I. During of the University of Gothenburg. He has written several excellent articles on Aristotle as the founder of scientific method and language, and he has presented much valuable documentary material relating to these questions.2 When I refer to the "method" or "methodology'' implicit in the work of Aristotle I mean method-in-use rather than what is explicitly set forth in his works on syllogistics. Naturally the two form complementary parts of a whole. The latter is the more conscious and articulate part, but not necessarily always what was followed to the letter in actual investigation. Moreover the syllogistics has more to do with the context of justification than the context of discovery. In this connection it may be worth while to remember Einstein's in junction to philosophers of science: "If you want to find out anything from the theoretical physicists about the methods they use, I advise you to stick closely to one principle: don't listen to their words, fix your attention to their deeds".3 Even if we cannot study Aristotle's "deeds" at first hand, history has preserved traces of them with his works. It is these traces that the rational reconstruction of a theory of research has to start with. And as in any other field, so in the archeology of scientific thought, what we can do with such traces to some extent depends upon our contemporary hermeneutic understanding. 2 I.

A DISTINCTION: DOXOGRAPHIC INDUCTION AND CLASSIFICATION Aristotle's ideas concerning the validation and presentation of argu ments are a chapter that has often been subject to meta-scientific enquiry. A more neglected topic is the "method" he used in the context of discov ery. What was the procedure of research work that preceded and led up to the final result which was presented in accordance with the well-known (Platonic-Aristotelian) deductive ideal of science? (Elsewhere I have referred to the "Euclidean ideal" of science: it implies both logical and epistemological demands on the final form of knowledge viz., deductive structure based on a few (finite number) of initial premises; complete certainty of these premises.)4 From the point of view of "criticism and growth" of science it is of considerable interest to look at a more neglected side of Aristotelian methodology. For the sake of reconstruction I want to propose the following distinction: a) doxographic induction from background knowledge b) classification into natural taxonomies. By and large these two are associated with two respective phases of the research procedure employed by Aristotle, and there is a dialectical interplay between them. Classification arranges or organizes what is already known (maybe the meaning is changed in the course of this); this is one of the functions of making taxonomies. A task of doxographic induction is to review existing opinion, ideas, half-theories etc. which may be contained in the written or spoken tradition of previous generations. The aim is to sort out "the good" from the "bad", and find principles to set at the head of classificatory schemes. Doxographic induction is mostly associated with the context of discov ery. It will form a main subject of my discussion. Classification has to do with the organisation of knowledge into a pattern satisfying certain logical and epistemological demands (e.g. those of the deductive ideal of science). Doxographic induction telescopes into it. Hence classification is a mode of abstraction that has some regulative bearing on the doxo graphic inductive phase of research preceding it. The organisation of knowledge by classification systems with Aristotle may be understood as a response to the deductive ideal of science and the associated ideal of certain knowledge, which is a concomitant of his overiding interest, viz., full insight or understanding. This for him is the real end of scientific activity. The deductive scheme is a means. 4 See my "Huygens' theory of research. . .", op. cit. For a general discussion of the term Platonic-Aristotelian deductive ideal of science, see e.g. A. Wedberg, Filosofins historia, vol. I (1958, Stockholm), p. 75 and Ch IV; and vol. II (1959, Stockholm), Ch. II.</page><page sequence="4">12 Aant Elzinga 3. THE ORGANISMIC VIEW, AND ORGANISATION OF KNOWLEDGE BY CLASSIFICATION According to Aristotle's way of looking at the world, a whole is in separable from its parts and at the same time irreducible to them; an example is the departure of the soul: "what is left is no longer a living animal, and that none of its parts remain what they were before, except ing in mere configuration" (De part. an. I 1, 614a, 18?21). From a mechanistic point of view there is no difference here, the configuration of the parts being what is the essential. What is taken as essential is to a considerable extent determined by the world outlook or viewpoint of the investigator. This is equally so for any outlook. The viewpoint has a certain regulative influence. To distinguish it from mechanistic explanation I shall refer to Aristotle's viewpoint as "organismic"5. It led him to look for "organismic" charac teristics in things and processes. It influenced the choice of the classification as method to assign individuals to classes. Thus it probably influenced the very systematisation of knowledge. Classification based on functional and homological principles was the method of abstraction used to separate the essential from what was considered as accidental. Natural events were primarily abstracted as traces of functions of organisms driven by a combination of contradictions between actual and potential states of being. The enquiry into such functions of vital processes and organs as are necessary to the characteristic activities of living things gives a teleolog ical program of analysis. The aim is to explain processes in terms of their goal-directed behaviour in the attainment of certain end-products or states. Aristotle applied this perspective to the whole of the universe and all its parts. He took a "bio-system" as his primary working analogy. With "bio-system" I mean something resembling an organism; empha sis is on the relationship of the parts to the whole, and of the whole to its environment. On the mechanistic viewpoint by contrast, the emphasis is on individual parts taken in isolation, and a system as a whole is regarded, for purposes of analysis, as closed off from its environment. The key notion of the mechanistic perspective which had its upsurge in the 16th and 17th centuries in Europe, is the well known one of the isolated closed mechanical system. In part the history of the new science that arose at that time may be interpreted as a history of a conception of a closed isolated mechanical system being forwarded in opposition to the organismic perspective of Aristotle. The principles at the heart of mechanistic explanation are quite different in character from those in organismic explanation. The latter imply the notion of development, the former constancy. The latter refer to quali tative change and processal development, rather than to states of quanti tative equilibrium and cumulatively additive characteristics such as 5 This apt term is used by Phillip Frank, Philosophy of Science, the Link between Science and Philosophy (1957, Englewood Cliffs, N. J.), 97ff. Coherence of all things, and development.</page><page sequence="5">Some remarks on a theory of research in the work of Aristotle 13 quantity of motion, momentum, energy. These two different types of principles lay at the center of two different ways of looking at the world, forming two different kinds of "paradigms". Aristotle distinguished what he maintained were different types of being and becoming. To each type was accorded a characteristic universal principle which was supposed to be responsible for a specific quality. In the setting up of a syllogistic pattern of demonstration a crucial point was to determine what class a particular instance of something belonged to. E.g. a stone dropped from a tower was taken to belong to the class of earthy things which by their nature tended to the center of the earth ? therefore the stone "falls down". This task of assigning locations in a taxonomy is not the same as that of setting up a classification scheme. Once a classification system has been set up to cover a large number of phenomena, it may acquire a paradig matic character. That is to say, the burden of the investigation is here after aimed at fitting in new discoveries and observations. It is a kind of routine or "normal" research task. This may continue until anomalies occur repeatedly, or inner contradictions arise, when a re-classification or re-organisation of the whole scheme may be called for. Thence the basic principles once again come into the arena of the disputed, and new principles are established. The reader will notice that I subscribe to the idea introduced by Thomas Kuhn, of tradition and revolution in science. I maintain that it affords a way of structuring large periods of the history of science; I mean that it gives a way of contrasting organismic and mechanistic traditions of research in particular. However I do not intend to argue in defence of this adoption of a standpoint in a modern historiographie debate, nor will I here attempt to make the model plausible by filling in the large gaps and possibilities of variation it leaves as to fine-structure of revolutionary change in science. My motivation for touching upon this controversial subject is that I think it is only fair to declare ones presuppositions at the outset, so that the venture may be better understood and constructive criticism facilitated. The point here is that I suggest we may associate a broad ideal of scientific explanation with a particular viewpoint or world outlook. The deductive ideal of science may be held by advocates both of organismic and mechanistic explanation. Yet there may be a difference as to the preferred formation of the explanatory scheme. I suggest that the organism ic view has associated with it in a more natural way the "method" of abstraction I call classification or taxonomy. It is perhaps not a coinci dence that for Aristotle the realization of the ideal of scientific explanation was found in the classification of the contents of the "cosmos" into taxonomic systems. Furthermore he seems to have meant that these systems of description and explanation reflected an order in objective reality itself. He did not regard them as mere convenient instruments for arranging a lot of observational material, or for prognos-making. He seems</page><page sequence="6">14 Aant Elzinga to have meant that they were natural classifications, corresponding to articulations of actual genus and species of things in the world; also, the classification schemes were regarded as absolute and not relative. On the organismic view all things in the world were supposed to be interconnected in a single "cosmos". The world is an integral whole closed in on itself, with nothing ? neither Being nor non-Being (void) ? outside it. "There is neither place nor time nor void beyond the heaven" (De caelo 21 di, 12). Space and time, and any other "form" is to be conceived as inseparable from matter or motion (change). They are the concrete determinations of substance, the realizations of potentialities in an anthropomorphic cosmos determined according to final principles. Abstractions such as matter-less space are rejected; they correspond to nothing in physical reality. The organismic perspective contains implicit in it a notion of an absolute frame of reference. All phenomena are in the last instance to be explained by reference to purposive activity within the framework of a coherent whole with mankind placed at the center. Within this framework qualita tive transformations are to be depicted as the work of deeper essences behind appearances; the world outlook guides us to a search for absolute principles that unite contradictories locked in mutual struggle ? e.g., life and death, matter and consciousness, rest and motion, etc. In the same way as parts of the world are supposed to be interconnected into an integral whole, so also its reflection, the pictures of the different parts of the world, or various classification schemes build a tightly knit world-picture. Classifications were made with the help of certain homological principles relating to the function of organs seen in the context of a complex whole with a certain purpose or end. The final cause of things is of particular interest. Aristotle may be claimed to have made the world of natural phenomena intelligible by introducing the notion of essence or final cause, the basic idea of a telos associated with organisms. An example of the finality of motion: (a teleological view is not identical with an organismic outlook). "Whenever there is plainly some final end, to which a motion tends should nothing stand in the way, we always say that such a final end is the aim or purpose of the motion" (De par an, I 1, 641b, 24?26). This may be the motion of an animal, of a growth process in embryo logy, or of what was called locomotion and in later history became distinguished as mechanical motion. The story of motion was for Aristotle much wider than the "motion" of mechanistic explanation. And behind all forms of motion one sought an end, a finalistic principle; in mechanistic explanation one sought what Aristotle referred to as the "efficient" cause. The above statement concerning tendencies to motion may be compar ed with the law of inertia which formed a pillar of mechanistic explanation in the 17th century ? a body continues in its motion in a straight line</page><page sequence="7">Some remarks on a theory of research in the work of Aristotle 15 (or at rest), should nothing stand in the way. The motion is taken as given. The point is to describe it, and changes in it, relating these to mechanical factors; there is no talk whatsoever of an "aim or purpose of the motion". Aristotle's classifications were most succesful in the realm of biology. Here it was different degrees of "vital heat" that he assumed in his principles, assumed to correspond to different classes of animal life. The classes were characterized, among other things, by their mode of repro duction : those with a higher degree of vital heat bear living young; those with a lower degree lay eggs; while still others must be satisfied with producing larvae; and the lowest form of animal life is characterized by a near lack of vital heat and is therefore supposed to be generated spon taneously from rotten materials. This latter notion has held a grip over the popular imagination right up to very recent times. A further principle Aristotle used to divide the realm of living things was one that distinguished different kinds of "souls" ? vegetative, animal, and rational (activity). Man, the rational animal who bears living young stood at the top of the Natural Staircase of life, as well as at the center of the cosmos, according to Aristotle's organismic picture of the world. In Aristotelian physics (which encompassed much more than what is today relegated to physics) a similar application of functional and homo logical principles is found. The whole universe is treated as an organism with a variety of parts (regions: e.g. dichotomy into supra-lunar and sub lunar) that have characteristic functions (species of motion: circular motion is natural in the supra-lunar sphere; rectilinear upward and downward motion is natural in the sub-lunar sphere, where circular motion is supposed to be a species of "violent motion"). The nearest thing to what we might call a "dynamical" law on this organismic scheme is for example the statement of a dichotomy of the cosmos into two regions of activity with mutually exclusive class properties (incorruptibility/cor ruptibility), or a further division of the latter of these. These are law statements focussing on qualitative change and differentiation. They are of quite a different sort from the laws of mechanistic explanation ? principles of conservation, of momentum and energy. They are not "universal" laws in the same sense as the latter, but pertain to local regions of the universe or to some phase of a process: they are "local" laws. The sort of pseudo-dynamical relationships regarding quantitative change we might formulate in analogy with mechanistic explanation, meaning that they are implicit in the Aristotelian scheme ? e.g. velocity a force/mass ? have actually no place as "laws". They are only construed so by comparative association (on the part of the historian) with central components in another sort of "paradigm". So even if a historian of science is not aware of it, when he begins to make such formulations attributed to Aristotle, he is actually unconsciously involving an idea of "paradigm" in his historiography. Thus why not try and make such hidden</page><page sequence="8">16 Aant Elzinga assumptions clear by exposing them (also for oneself) ? Here the theory of science has an important therapeutic function to serve for the historio graphy of science. (In line with Aristotle's idea of understanding). Aristotle's treatise, the Physics is a good example of his two-phase approach, where doxographic induction is followed by classification. In Book I the principles of change and motion are dialectically examined on the basis of theories of earlier investigators. Book II makes a clean "start", turning to the direct examination of Nature. The result is a grand classi fication scheme of the physical world. It is implicit in most of Aristotle's writings. The world outlook contains continuation of Empedoclean physics. It rests on a basic conception of pairs of mutually antagonistic qualities operating in prime matter (hyle), which itself has no form and does not exist except as a potential. The resulting scheme can give an example of the power of Aristotle's classificatory mode of explanation and systematisation. At the same time if we recognize its unificatory properties and its extensibility to other regions, it gives us an inkling of why it was not so strange that the organismic scheme proposed by Aristotle had such a long-lasting hegemony. It did possess a certain elegance, and common unrefined experience probably seemed to lend it "empirical" support and reinforced it. One felt one "understood". Of the two pairs of qualities, hot-cold, dry-wet, the former couplet may be taken as the active, the latter as the more passive. Struggle between these opposites determine the four elements, earth, water, air, and fire, which had been postulated by Pre-Socratics. What "form" and movement obtains depends upon a balance of forces. If hot dominates over cold and dry over wet, one gets fire (striving upward); if cold dominates over hot and dry over wet, we have earth (striving downward), etc. sanguine choleric blood yellow bile air I- hot - fire II wet &lt;? ?&gt; dry II I-cold water earth phlegm black gall phlegmatic melancholic The schema of four struggling principles and four elements was further elaborated in antiquity. In accordance with the general classificatory scheme it was made to yield not only a theory of natural place (mechanics) but also a theory of four humours (psychology, anthropology). Just like</page><page sequence="9">Some remarks on a theory of research in the work of Aristotle 17 things had their "natural" activities (motion) assigned to them on the basis of classification of their strivances to gain a final end, or "natural" place in the world order, so also people were supposed to have natural types of behaviour, giving a typology of natural characters. It all depend ed, in both realms, on the balance of the primitive contradictory prin ciples locked in struggle: which dominated and which was subordinated. The theory of psychological types still leaves its imprint in ordinary speech useage today, in such expressions as sanguinous, phlegmatic, choleric and melancholic used to describe personalities. In as far as these modes of speech are useful and meaningful they can still lend "empirical" support of a gross kind to Aristotelian programs of research even today. It is evident that Aristotle's "theories" were based upon and made a synthesis of ingredients of background knowledge of his time. This was one important factor in the genesis of his ideas. The other was criticism. Background knowledge was constituted by such ideas as were contained in previous "schools" or "traditions" of thought, e.g., Presocratic. It also contained what usually goes under the term of "everyday common sense" or "know-how" of the time. Criticism of this indirect experience involved preliminary evaluation of it with the aim of finding ideas that were likely candidates for placing in key positions in classificatory schemes; i.e. potential knowledge. Growth by criticism of predecessors. Background knowledge and criticism can be brought together in the prospecting phase of research, what I have called doxographic induction in connection with Aristotle. The way to knowlegde began with doxa, opinion of different degrees of reliability. The way to knowledge was supposed to go via hypothesis, or an arbitrary accepting of an idea for the sake of proving it, through criticism. Knowledge, or episteme is arrived at when the hypothesis is destroyed, that is to say the unproven and hidden suppositions it rests upon are made transparent, tested and thence remov ed. This is in broad outlines the general dialectics of investigation I find in the work of Aristotle. This is what I now want to examine more closely. 4. INTELLECTUAL PROSPECTING Just like in industrial enterprise, geological prospecting for mineral resources may precede production of processed ores, so in scientific enter prise prospecting for ideas precedes the production of half-baked and full-fledged theories. Once the prospecting has yielded a wealth of samples, the time comes to bring arrangement into them, using some principles of classification. But an important factor for its success is the prospecting which went before. Now what is prospecting in connection with research ? Traditional accounts of the "philosophy of science" have not given due account to this important preparatory phase in the research process. Therefore a few introductory words are needed. I shall quote from a lecture of prof. Hakan Tornebohm who has made the concept of prospect ing a key notion in the theory of science: "There is a first phase of research 2</page><page sequence="10">18 Aant Elzinga which may be called a p-phase. The scientist constructs a plan or a program or makes a project. What actually happens in this phase is that already existing knowledge about the territory (of objective reality T) is collected and some speculations are added to this knowledge. A set of questions is added as well. We get something which I should like to call a.prospect, i.e., some sort of map over a territory consisting of three parts, one part being knowledge, the other one speculation and the rest being questions (problems). We also have an assembly of knowledge-producing instruments which includes language, mathematics, a conceptual frame work and various other techniques, hardware instruments plus knowledge about how to use them ... a research project (is made), which serves as a steering organ for research. Research project includes queries, some in formation which has the status of knowledge and some information which does not yet have this exalted status, i.e., which is speculative (together these form "background knowledge"). It also includes a plan of how to use the knowledge producing instruments in order to answer the questions. This is the first stage or phase of the research which might be called prospecting"6. Of course it is admitted that the picture drawn here is to some extent imaginary, but at the same time it has been found to capture an essential aspect of research, even if in a stylized manner. It is evident that the researcher himself may not be aware of the "project" as "steering organ", in the sense it has been reconstructed in an ideal type here. But most people will admit that in the actual course of research, even at its inception there is indeed some form of conscious order in the enterprise which distinguishes it from hap-hazard behaviour. I have indicated that in the work of Aristotle an important preparatory phase is just that of actualizing potential knowledge that is contained in the opinions of predecessors. This is done by a systematic review of previous opinion and theory. This is what I have called doxographic induction. Induction is the proceeding from the particular to the universal according to Aristotle. He refers to it as epagoge, "a leading to something", and defines it as "a way from the individual to the general". Syllogism which may spring from induction stands for the "summarizing, compar ing, combining thought"7. It is the movement back from the highest genus (categories) to the individual. In practice syllogism never goes to the individual as such, but always moves between different levels of general concepts. Under the prospecting one may have in mind the final aim, a syllogistic pattern of argument and perhaps a classificatory scheme. I mean that with Aristotle doxographic induction is the specific form prospecting takes. It is the lever whereby the most relevant and best 6 Hakan Tornebohm, "Science of science", pt. 20: Lectures upon invitation at the CCR Euratom Ispra Establishment 1969; stencil 10.11.69 Inst. f. Theory of Science, University of Goteborg (italics his). 7 cited in During, Lychnos, 54.</page><page sequence="11">Some remarks on a theory of research in the work of Aristotle 19 parts from the background knowledge consisting of theoires, warranted opinions and expert opinions, are sifted. Doxa, as opposed to episteme does not imply the existence of grounds for belief. Episteme, as well founded certain and demonstrable knowledge is the ideal, the "efficient" cause of the research activity itself, whose final end is perfect understand ing. Hypothesis is as I have said, a half-way house between these two opposite poles, unfounded opinion and well grounded knowledge. But already warranted opinion is a step on the way away from mere hearsay or prejudice, because it enjoys a majority consensus8. Therefore hypothesiz ing is a further step beyond it. It is a deliberate adoption of a view for the sake of enquiry, for proving. This means growth of knowledge should proceed by dissolving ignorance, passing from relative lack of knowledge to warranted opinion, to deliberate hypothesizing, to true knowledge by destroying hypothesis or presupposals. This chain is initiated by pros pecting which serves up a survey of opinion and hypotheses in back ground knowledge and it is reiterated. In regard to the doctrine of episteme Aristotle seems to have taken something from Plato, who presumably formed the ideal in connection with his reflexions on mathematical certainty. Plato contrasted doxa, as unfounded belief, on the one hand, against aisthesis, or perceptual knowledge and on the other against episteme. 5. SOME FUNCTIONS OF PROSPECTING, ANAMNESIS; LEADING THE MIND INTO PARADIGMS Plato also held a theory of anamnesis according to which man once had perfect knowledge, but lost it in a kind of epistemological fall. Ordinarily then, one has a dim awareness, a dreamlike recollection of this lost original knowledge. A few privileged people, according to Plato, the philosopher-kings, are in a position to recapture it. This is done through a mental process of disciplined re-collection, anamnesis, of distant memories to arrive at episteme. Presumably this procedure, somewhat like the feats of the yogi masters of other traditions, requires a certain amount of training, which may bear resemblance to a training for creative research work. The elite who come into possession of the "method" hold the key to the secrets of the universe (cp. the Pythagorean rites ? it is possible Plato got some of his ideas here from their life-praxis). The Socratic (maieutic), or intellectual midwifery, can with some plausibility also be interpreted as such a method to help people in "recall ing". And similarly with the doxographic induction we attribute to 8 see e. g. K. Oehler, "Der consensus omnium als Kriterium der Wahrheit in der Antiken Philosophie", Antike und Abendland, X (1961), 103?129. For the question of classification and growth of science by a dialectical movement from doxa, over hypotheses, to episteme, see I. M. Crombie, An Examination of Plato's Doctrines (1963, London). 2*</page><page sequence="12">20 Aant Elzinga Aristotle as a part of his theory of research. It is possible that it is also related to the re-collection of "pure" original ideas, which are hidden latent within the verbal and written traditions of predecessors. However it is not necessary to subscribe to Plato's theory of anamnesis in detail in order to have motivation for wielding the method of "re-call" by doxographic induction from a collective memory of the past. It is possible, whatever the motive, to have interest in a review of background knowledge and weed out contradictory views, hidden assumptions, etc. from it. The research-guiding motivation may indeed have changed over the ages, from a more practical technological one with the Presocratics, to a more hermeneutic emancipatory one (for an elite) with Plato. If so this perhaps reflects a change in the social life over the same period of time (For example it is known that there was also a corresponding shift of interest from philosophy of nature to problems of a political and moral kind having to do with governing in a civic state). I shall come back to the question of external factors in the social setting of science9. Hitherto I have discussed prospecting and anamnesis in relation to the context of discovery, where the function often is to serve clues. However this mode of research work also has important psychological aspects, and these extend into the context of presentation. One reason why a researcher might present his work the way Aristotle did, with a doxographic survey openly preceding a presentation of his own principles and arguments, is to draw the reader into a certain frame of mind. In a sense this logic of presentation, which follows the logic of discovery, may help the reader to discover for himself the results arrived at. Moreover it may help to lead his mind into the frame of the paradigm subscribed to or built up by the researcher. This is a persuasive function of doxographic induction, which guides the reader to seeing things in a certain perspective as the natural perspective. Since the induction is from common and warranted opinions, the perspective may seem to lie within the very materials of the background knowledge, once it is stripped of all contradictions and hidden assumptions are exposed. There is nothing irrational about this. Another psychological aspect belonging to the social setting of science is that the re-collecting gives a sense of historicity, a sense of belonging to 9 Jiirgen Habermas, for example, distinguishes a technical-manipulative research motivating interest from a hermeneutic-emancipatory one. The latter has to do with under standing for the sake of self-transcendence. It may take the form of criticism of ideologies. Typically, questions as to the rationality of ends are adressed to human activity, as con trasted with the means-ends rationality of the technical-manipulative interest. According the Habermas school of metascience, the theory of science itself also has the important function of contributing to self-transparency, to emancipate the human consciousness from dogmatic hang ups. In this context the function of the metascientists with criticism of ideologies is comparable to the psychoanalysts' who seek to resolve contradictions (con flicts) in a social setting by helping people to insight about themselves. See below p. 31.</page><page sequence="13">Some remarks on a theory of research in the work of Aristotle 21 a collective. Aristotle was aware of the positive features of such an attitude. It encouraged the researcher. "The study of Truth is in one sense difficult, in another easy. This is shown by the fact that whereas no one person can gain an adequate grasp of it, we cannot all fail in the attempt; each thinker makes a statement about the natural world, and as an individual contributes little or nothing to the inquiry, but a combination of all conjectures results in something considerable" (Metaphys. Bk II, i). The doxographic inductive phase of research reminds one on this in a natural way. Hence it contributes to the creation of an optimistic attitude for turning ignorance to knowledge, by keeping the social nature of the enterprise in perspective. It affords inspiration for the individual investi gator, and provides him with an historical awareness of his own work as part of that larger collective enterprise, improvement of the world picture, and betterment of the world by striving to change it in accord ance with his world outlook. For Aristotle himself the research act seems to have been its own motivation. He speaks of it as a response to wonderment. The activity of research work is supposed to lead to a quieting of the wonderment, in a dialectical movement from ignorance or relative lack of knowledge, to its opposite, to the possession of knowledge. This latter state is a negation of the former, and supplants it. As long as wonderment continues, research should continue to be spurred on. Aristotle's own words regarding this dialectical movement from problems to knowledge: "The acquisition of this [universal, or theoretical] knowledge must in a sense result in something which is the reverse of the outlook with which we first approached the inquiry. All begin, as we have said, by wonder ing that things should be as they are, e.g., in regard to marionettes, or the solstices, or the measurability of the diagnal of a square; but we must end with the contrary (and according to the proverb) the better view, as men do in these cases where they understand them ..." [Metaphys. Bk I, Chii). In the prospecting phase one may go into the inquiry, with spontaneous and ill-founded views. One is to come out of it with well-founded knowl edge, which is consolidated by being organized into some body or system, a classificatory scheme. Now various modern writers have noticed that in Aristotle's works there may sometimes be distinguished two phases, the first of which corresponds to what I have called doxographic induction. If we look at this more closely one finds that a couple of common criticism of Aristotle have to be removed: viz., ones to the extent that he was anti-empirical (or at least non-empirical), and that the doctrine of episteme somehow implied dogmatism.</page><page sequence="14">22 Aant Elzinga 6. DOXOGRAPHIC INDUCTION IS NOT ANTI-EMPIRICAL The logic of the presentation in Aristotle's treatises thus parallels the two dialectically connected phases of the process of research. They often begin with a survey of previous opinion in the topic considered. After a first "start", a second or third fresh start is made to examine things more directly. This order of presentation seems to correspond to a general logic of investigation. The procedure of the first phase involves prospecting, or more specifically the form of it I call doxographic induction. It is "induction" made from previous experience in the form of opinions (doxa), etc. The procedure of the second and further "start" is more closely associated with what I call classification. The latter is at once a method of continued enquiry and a systematisation of results. Of course in the actual research process discovery and systematisation, doxographic induction and classification interpenetrate. It is only in the context of presentation that a sharp separation may occur. Indeed, in modern presentation of research results the first phase is entirely left out, or else reflected in very truncated form in an introduction. The deductive ideal of science has brought with it the aim of presenting results as a grand architectonic structure with all the scaffolding involved to build it taken away. The deductive scheme becomes an end in itself, and it appears as though prospecting never occurs. (This is one reason why textbooks when they assume the deductive ideal may tend to inspire wrong notions as to the method of science and paralyse rather than stimulate the mind of the student. It is our belief that insight into pro specting and history of science should be considered invaluable ingredients in science teaching at every level.) The first phase of his mode of presentation Aristotle calls historia. In it is made a presentation of the factual materials, often in the form of a history of the problem. The arguments and counter-arguments for a particular thesis are set forth. The background knowledge is presented, while prospecting openly for possible formulations of the problem (s) and clues to support various principles to be used as likely candidates in demonstrative arguments that are the goal of the whole enterprise. In the course of the historia new problems may also be generated. In the second phase the classificatory procedure begins to set in, as "experiential" material is penetrated further and sorted under the guidance of the hunt for principles. These are called aitiai, the causes or grounds. In this phase of the investigation Aristotle puts forth his own ideas, arrived at on the basis of prospecting and sometimes involving a synthesis of contradictory elements in the background knowledge he inherited. Here the scheme of the four-cause theory can also come into play. With the benefit of what is fresh in the mind from the first "start", general principles may be framed and backed up with evidence. The Physics is a good example of this dialectic of presentation corresponding to two phases in research work.</page><page sequence="15">Some remarks on a theory of research in the work of Aristotle 23 I. During has pointed out that Aristotle's way of diving into the subject by starting with a critical survey of the background knowledge contribut ed by previous generations is historically quite natural. Research results were often spread by word of mouth, by reading over and over in many different places from some or other "dissertation" in written form10. Aristotle gathered such treatises, as well as copies and annotations from them by various people. What I want to make plausible is that this was not only a procedure due to historical circumstance, but also formed an essential part of a conscious "theory of research" with Aristotle. It was an integral part of the phase of research I have referred to as prospecting. In the course of this indirect collective knowledge and experience was assembled and brought into confrontation with direct contemporary observations. It was a critical activity. The original meaning of historia is, "research"! It is sometimes held that Aristotle was an enemy of experience because he did not do experimental work. It is even suggested that he was anti empirical, speculative. This judgement does not accord with the attri bution to him of a theory of research which involves prospecting, be it doxographic induction interpreted as anamnesis, or as collection, the phase preceding division (classification) in a dialectical procedure (see below, p. 25). Anyone who will pause to reflect a little over the implications of doxographic induction taken as a mode of prospecting, will realize that it easily is "empirical"; especially when it is used to systematically re call the collective memory of past experience. Here we think of experience in a broad sense: laid down in the collective memory in society. The narrow empiricist notion of "experience" only misleads if applied here. For "Yet it was the empiricists of antiquity who were the idolators of books, for it is in books they claimed, that empirical knowledge of previous generations is stored up"11. An "empricist" in this ancient sense was just one who did doxographic induction. For was it not this method which was to release empirical knowledge in a critical way from books and put it into possession of the contemporary investigator? He had it at hand when tackling specific problems. In the process of making past experience from books his own, it is not unusual if the researcher consciously or uncon sciously checked it for internal consistency and matched it against raw and rather unrefined experience of a first hand kind from his contem porary setting. Thus we can say that, if this is so, doxographic induction has the makings of a procedure that includes a strong empirical and critical inclination. And there is reason to believe it was so with Aristotle. In his texts there are many traces of Aristotle's "empiricist" attitude. Various remarks also indicate it. Thus he approvingly cites Proclus as saying, "experience produces art, but inexperience chance" (Metaphys. 10 Op. cit. (2). 11 Ludwig Edelstein, "Recent Trends in the Interpretation of Ancient Science", Weiner and Noland eds., The Roots of Scientific Thought (1958, New York), 94.</page><page sequence="16">24 Aant Elzinga I i, 4?7). He also complained of his predecessors that they often roamed too far from the facts of experience, and therefore went wrong. (De gen et corr., I 2, 316 a 8). His own expert observations in the field of marine biology are still remembered by researchers in that field today. Aristotle held that it was from memory that men acquired experience, because the numerous memories of the same thing eventually produced the effect of a single experience. One could go on to cite many examples in support of Aristotle's critical and empirical inclination. This does not mean to say that Aristotle always critically checked every single hearsay, opinion, supposed fact or prejudice which came into his possession as a part of background knowledge. No, sometimes the most curious errors were passed on as truth ? this only proves the rule. Thus for example he believed that "men have more teeth then women" (Hist an. II 3, 501b 19); and that "man has eight ribs" (Hist an. I 15, 493b 14). But Historia animalium remains his great feat of historia. In contrast to "our" modern day empiricists who look upon "ex perience" as something particularistic and fragmentary, associated with atomic individuals, Aristotle evidently had a social sence of research and its starting point in experience. For him the method of processing un founded opinion through doxographic induction in fact seems to some extent to receive its legitimation from the social character of the very enterprise. He says: "Not only once, but many times, and in the passage of time, many times one and the same opinion and explanatory ground finds its way to researchers, independently of predecessors" (De caelo 270b 19; cp. Meteors, I 3, 339b 27). Previous thinkers, often independently of one another have grasped partial grains of truth. Thus opinion must be endowed with some element of objectivity. The question is to collect the scattered fragmentary truths and assemble them together under the roof of a single unifying idea. A critical dialectical survey (prospecting) begins this job. The kernel of reliable opinion is to be winnowed from the chaff of the unreliable, and thereupon a synthesis of what is correct in previously conflicting tradi tions is sought. Thesis and counter-thesis become united into something new. If my reconstruction is found plausible, two things must be clear now. Aristotle was not anti-empirical; His "theory of research" includes an "empirical" moment. And, his "theory of research" has aspects of interest to both sociology and psychology of science too. It remains to argue that the possession of such a theory of research involving prospecting from collective social experience in the way Aristotle probably did is not a sign of dogmatism, but rather of a critical dialectical standpoint. First I shall argue that doxographic induction is actually a part of an older dialectical method of investigation, in fact the very continuation of the</page><page sequence="17">Some remarks on a theory of research in the work of Aristotle 25 one Karl Popper calls a critical tradition (which he traces to the Pre socratics) and not as Popper would have a negation of this tradition, or an embracing of dogmatism12. 7. PROSPECTING IS A MOMENT OF DIALECTICS13 Dialectics in one sense is the turning over in the mind to look at a pro blem or at our concepts of things from all sides in order to draw out what is general from what is specific, and to seek out development. One can distinguish subjective from objective dialectics. The latter is an ob jective movement in nature whereby things change continuously from one form to another according to certain fundamental laws. The former is a mental movement at the conceptual level, wich when most successful is supposed to correspond to or give an epistemic mapping of the dialectics of nature. To a movement of ideas corresponds a movement in nature. For idealism the ideas are primary, for materialism the material world is. Once subjective dialectics becomes conscious of "its" own movement, one may speak of the emergence of a methodological awareness, of a "method" of investigation. And through this self-reflexivity, research and method are further improved. In Europe, historically, dialectics apparently goes back at least as far as the 5th century B. C. Among the Presocratics it existed, probably as something spontaneous, a method-in-use. Thereafter came articulation, whereupon induction and classification seem to have emerged as two distinctive phases or moments. Thus Plato's twin method of (the later) dialectics consisted in collection and division. This latter moment became the proto-type of classification14. With Aristotle we find the sifting of doxographic "experience" by prospective re-collection already established as an elementary form of research praxis, going hand in hand with classification as natural counterpart. In later times, and at a higher level of development, we find the praxis typically became experimental praxis, counterpoised and united with advanced mathematical work as hand maiden on the theoretical pole. Plato, the author of the doctrine of Ideas was a strong advocate of a dialectical mode of reasoning (subjective dialectics), even if he hardly made explicit wherein this method consisted. It seems to have been associated with an analysis of similarities and differences, unity and variety, identity and non-identity, existence and non-existence. These were concepts to be used when (dialectically) turning things over in the mind, in order to analytically divide them into their kinds and subkinds ? i. e. to classify. 12 Karl Popper, Introduction ("On the sources of knowledge and ignorance"), of Con jectures and Refutations, the Growth of Scientific Knowledge (1963, London), 3?30, esp. ? VII-XI. 13 The dialectical element in Aristotle's "method of science" is also emphasized by Richard McKeon, in "Aristotle's conception of Scientific Method", Weiner and Noland eds., 73?89. 14 J. E. Raven, Plato's Thought in the Making (1965, Cambridge), 190.</page><page sequence="18">26 Aant Elzinga Some modern thinkers see induction as having come out of dialectics, it being a process of dialectic whereby there is an upward movement of thought from hypothesis to higher levels of abstraction15. This later dialectics is also called a method of collection and division; i.e., of bring ing together scattered instances under a single idea, and dividing up again into classes according to natural articulations (or joints) ? a good dialectician is like a good butcher; he knows at which joints to cut: a bad one is a bad butcher; he makes a mess. It may well be that the two phases of investigation we attribute to Aristotle as part of his "theory of research", correspond to collection (prospecting ? doxographic induction) and division (classification) respectively. Plato's dialectics was modelled on mathematics, and hardly can have strayed far from the realm of mathematical Forms. In this connection the emphasis must have been on deduction. But Aristotle, a pupil of Plato, turned to an investigation of the forms of the natural world, and their changes. Therefore induction in the above-named sense must have been necessary before a division or classification of things could be made. It is plausible to interpret his (doxographic) induction as a collecting of scatter ed reports and instances. Here it should by clear, if it wasn't already, how misleading it must be to identify induction in this broad sense with the later more narrow empiri cist designations of the term. It may be asked if empiricism leaves any room for prospecting, or dialectics on the whole ? Aristotle's own view of the history of the inductive instrument lends further support to the idea that it came out of dialectics. He attributed its invention to Socrates who is regarded as a practicioner of maieutics or intellectual midwifery. It is said that Socrates helped others bring forth thoughts into the world, by a process of interrogation in which are asked questions demanding yes or no anwers. The aim is to demolish presup positions. The person interrogated might not have been previously aware of having held these presuppositions. The maieutic procedure releases him from them by making them transparent to him, hence permitting his think ing to advance further beyond some or other knot. By having unfounded hidden assumptions exposed he is brought nearer insight and understand ing, he is helped to develop an idea. Once this methodological procedure is internalized in his own thinking as a self-consciousness, he should become more cautious and less one-sided (more dialectical). Socrates' treatment may be regarded as a kind of therapeutics which instills an awareness of 15 The classification turn in research is closely linked with justificatory argument; where, as syllogism it stands for something more than its narrow modern sense of argument depending upon insight into the relations of class-inclusion. In general it is referred to as the drawing of conclusions from accepted premises. (Raven, op. cit., 22). Also every dialect ical argument is either an induction or a syllogism (Raven refers to Topics, I, 12).</page><page sequence="19">Some remarks on a theory of research in the work of Aristotle 27 dialectics16. Ideas are growing in the mind; dialectics helps draw them out. It will be noticed how the therepeutical procedure if it is embedded or socialized in a community of investigators should be a ' 'method" that facilitates the movement from doxa, over hypothesis, to episteme, of which I have spoken above. Here again it is important to take account of the social setting of scientific investigation. For it is the character of the social setting which in the final reckoning determines if a dialectical mode of reasoning can live as a creative instrument, or whether it is negated, to be transformed to everything that it is not, in short a dogmatic mode of reasoning. There seems to be a hairline between dialogue and rhetoric. These are two opposing tendencies, two sides in a question-answer situation. Which is the dominant, the one that is steadily reinforced, and which subordinate, this depends upon the social setting of the question-answer situation, of the "dialogue". 8. ON SOURCES OF DOGMATISM The questions posed by Socrates sometimes border on the rhetorical. This is not so strange, because to some extent he had at his disposal the same tools as intellectual midwife as used by the Sophists. They were expert at the game of public debate or dispute. In such disputations one of the rules was that the one partner asked questions to which the other one could only answer yes or no. The goal of the questioner was to trap his opponent into contradicting himself. The point often became to win by any means, fair or foul. The professional disputer perhaps resembled the card shark of wild western films. Each lived by applying or teaching a bagful of sharp tricks. Here we have a distinction between rhetorical and dialectical modes of exchange in a speech community. These are social modes. Xenophon reported Socrates as saying that the practice of dialectics is the way a man can "sort out things into their kinds by taking counsel with each other" (our italics). Things become sorted out to himself by exposing his ideas to ctiticism by others. Also the dialectician is said to be the man who can sort out the good from the bad. (Memorabilia, IV, 5; 12). Dialectical method is social, and it involves criticism. We have noted that these must also be the essential ingredients of what we called prospecting. If there is to be fruitful counsel with others, it implies the existence of a free speech community in which dialogue is possible. Several factors contribute to success or failure here. One is the comparative levels of 16 It may be questioned if the births at which Socrates assisted really gave living off spring. See Mats Furberg, Vision och skepsis (1969, Stockholm), which contains a thought provoking discussion of dialectics and related methods of analysis.</page><page sequence="20">28 Aant Elzinga knowledge of questioner and respondent. If "the others" we take counsel with have a far inferior or far superior level of knowledge it may lead to difficulties. In the first mentioned case because the questioner will have difficulty to ask informed and relevant questions, or else he may be so impressed by the authority of the respondent, that he is uncritical of the latter: thence a free dialectic is inhibited by an imbalance in the knowl edge situation. In the second mentioned case, the questioner may be an authority and inhibit the respondent, or else by his knowledge of details sidetrack the discussion again and again, thus shifting further and further away from the strategic goal of the dialectic, the finding of truth. There may also be other causes which conjoin to form an authoritarian structure in the therapeutic situation, apart from relative cognitive democracy. These causes may stem from factors in the society at large in which the community of investigators live and work. An often cited modern example is the ideological and political repression of the nazi regime in Germany during the thirties and forties of this century, causing some scientists to leave for research communities in other countries, and causing others to underpin their rational activities with idealist myths of blot und boden. Such a theory on the social foundations of criticism or dogmatism, respectively, is indeed implicitly suggested by Karl Popper. The suggestion lies in his liberal social philosophy with its basic distinction between open and closed societies17. These are conceivable ideal types, where the former is just characterized by the blossoming of a critical rational dialogue between all its members, and in the latter criticism is not possible. This is just the line of thought that has been developed in the theory of science of the contemporary hermeneutic dialectical school18. It is easily seen that dialectics has a social character. Therefore if theory of science studies methodology, the dimension of social praxis and communication must be included among meta-scientific categories. 17 Karl Popper, The Open Society and its Enemies (1962) 2 vol. 18 On this school see, Gerard Radnitzky, Contemporary Schools of Metascience vol. II (1968, Lund), 19ff, and 147ff. There has been an interesting debate between representatives of this school and the Popper group ? a dialectical vs. a criticist approach: Heinz Maus and Friederich Fiirstenberg ed., Der Positivismusstreit in der deutschen Soziologie (1969, Neuwied/Berlin). A specific issue in the hermeneutic dialectical school is the question of factors which bear up "criticism and growth" in a communication community. Prophets of this school have had close associations with the "anti-authoritarian" movement of students and intellectuals during the latter part of the protest-sixties. They find their ideal for a Utopian and anti-authoritarian ethic in the ideal typical scientific community, which is a construct of their minds. In actual fact their contribution to the "protest potential" of the students has been to channelize it into tamer channels, which keep the steam from finding the really vulnerable seams of the form of society protested against. In this school see, e.g. J. Habermas, "Toward a theory of communicative competence", Inquiry 13, (1970) forthcoming; and in Habermas-Luchmann Theorie der Gesellschaft oder Sozialtechnologie ? was leistet die Systemforschungl (1971, Suhrkamp, Frankfurt a.M.).

Within a scientific community, just like at the ancient games of public disputation, it becomes formalized according to rules which govern intercourse between members of a communication community. It retains its character as dialectic (dialogue) only as long as a feed-back obtains in the communi cation. Criticism and self-criticism, of the own and other traditions or programs of research, has to obtain if the dialectic is to thrive. When the feedback is broken, so that only (persuasive) monologue obtains, we have rhetoric. The creative leaps of ideas which constitute progress or growth in science collapse. The enterprise ceases to be one of research in its root meaning. It no longer functions as a collective creative activity, but becomes the very opposite, a manipulative coercive procedure aimed at duping others and forcing views on them by persuasion. The dialectic (and so also the research community) for its functioning requires that the dialectic is upheld by all participants of the enterprise as free equals. Dialectics as a part of research procedure therefore presupposes the existence of extra-scientific conditions which are conducive to keeping critical dialogue alive within the community of investigators, in the form of criticism and self-criticism. In the absence of a critical attitude doxo graphic induction becomes dogmatic doxography, the same as spelling out of the book of the master and in afterhand checking to see if Nature accords with what it says there ? and if it does not, much the worse for Nature, rather than vice versa. Now we have to consider the question if such a situation reigned during the centuries following Aristotle, and if so how long after, and did it contribute to a rhetorical propagation of Aristotelian ideas by mere authority of tradition ? In Popperian terminology, to what extent was the society at that time open, and hence facilitated critical methods; and to what extent was it closed, and affected rational enterprises with dogmatic tendencies? The rise of an extremely authoritarian social order and the hegemony in it of a corresponding ideology is one possible reason for the death of the critical tradition. Historical research would have to show how feudalism worked on this score. Another reason for the purported death of criticist tradition is the one prosposed by Popper: its grave was dug by the doctrine of episteme, of certainty of the established results. Or perhaps there is still some other reason why Aristotle's work in science tended to become dogma, why it was not critically developed by the application upon itself (as background knowledge) of continued pro specting ?</page><page sequence="22">30 Aant Elzinga 9. KARL POPPER, ARISTOTLE, AND THE EPISTEMOLOGICAL FALL19 'To my knowledge the critical or rationalist tradition was invented only once. It was lost after two or three centuries, perhaps owing to the rise of the Aristotelian doctrine of episteme, of certain and demonstrable knowledge, (a development of the Eleatic and Heraclitean distinction between certain truth and mere guesswork). It was rediscovered and consciously revived by the Renaissance, especially by Galileo Galilei'' (Popper)20. Karl Popper suggests it was Aristotle's acceptance (even if in modified form) of Plato's doctrine of episteme that was responsible for a stiffling of what Popper calls the critical and rational tradition of the Presocratics. I cannot wholly convince myself of this21. Apart from the fact that I do not see the Presocratics merely as critical rationalists, but rather as materialists with a spontaneous dialec tical method-in-use, it seems to me unreasonable to suppose that the ideal of episteme of its own power could generate dogmatism. Of course I admit that as any ideal it certainly can have contributed to a reinforce ment and even a rational legitimation of some (dogmatic) tendencies in society. But I connot see that it was the determinant factor, which I believe must be sought elsewhere. With Plato the dialectical "sorting out" of things was a procedure of conceptual dichotomy held at a high theoretical level. Dialectics moreover aimed at the recovery of the true nature of objectively existing rational principles which man was held to dimly perceive after the Epistemological Fall (Popper). In this context induction and other methods of investi gation can be understood as aimed at the recovery (by recall) of the original kernel of truth, by removing a mesh of false beliefs and idols from the mind. Now, as I noted before, it is not neceasary that Aristotle subscribed to Plato's idealistic theory of anamnesis. He might equally well maintain the ideal of absolute certainty of knowledge without it; the practical research strategy would be the same: to try and arrive at the ideal type of understanding, by doxographic induction and classification. I have argued that Aristotle in the context of discovery made use of a method of prospecting, and that he openly revealed this in the context of presentation. The deductive ideal of science did not lead him to take away all the scaffolding in his presentation of results, as it did in modern times. Further, I mean that prospecting by nature is a critical moment in research. That this is often forgotten is because it has been deemed 19 Karl Popper, Conjectures and Refutations, 12 f. 20 ibid., ("Back to the Presocratics"), 151. Popper sees it at the same time as the emerg ence of a plurality of doctrines, vs. one school doctrine. The idea of theoretical pluralism has been developed consistently, but to absurd lengths (anarchy) by Paul K. Feyerabend. 21 One should bear in mind that Popper's reconstructions of past works are often "likely stories". For a trouncing critique of his treatment of Hegel in the Open Society and its Enemies, see e.g. Walter Kaufmann, From Shakespeare to Existentialism (1960, New York), 94-128.</page><page sequence="23">Some remarks on a theory of research in the work of Aristotle 31 respectable not to give an account of how one arrives at scientific results. That is often relegated to "psychology". If it is accepted that Aristotle did intellectual prospecting, and that this is a critical task of methodo logy, it should be agreed that these are signs that he was in fact less dogmatic and more critical than modern day empricists who have their think-tanks filled with formal logic; and against whom Popper also polemicizes for their dogmatic attitude regarding knowledge. Moreover if Aristotle himself had thought he had said the last word with his classification schemes, why was Theophrastus sent out to continue the work by collecting further observations in the field? Now I admit that Theophrastus22 may have already been doing normal science within a paradigm of an Aristotelian classificatory scheme, but even so there is nothing to indicate that he was not a critical investigator in his own right. As for those who followed and were uncritical the blame cannot be laid upon Aristotle, nor on his having dreamt of absolute certainty of knowledge, as the means to full understanding. All this in itself is not sufficient reason to believe in a breakdown of dialectic, or its transformation to authoritarian rhetoric passed on by tradition in a community of investigators. We must widen the scope of metascientific inquiry. To answer certain problems reference must be had to the so-called external relations of science. Now it appears that Aristotle was not taken over as an unquestionable authority until well into the Middle Ages, with the rise of scholasticism. With Augustinus who also subscribed to the doctrine of certainty, one still finds the employment of a critical mode of doxographic induction (see e.g. the Summa Theologica) in a very systematic manner23. A thesis is posed, and thereupon arguments for and arguments against it listed, while it is said whose arguments were which. Only thereafter does Augustinus himself make a summary or synthesis and offers his own standpoint and viewpoint. It is explicitly stated that this is his own view. In those few instances where argument from authority occurs it is made explicitly clear that this is such an argument. This is in itself a critical stance. As I see it this method of what I call doxographic induction continued as a critical method which stands in a direct line, connected through Aristotle, with positive aspects of the formal rules of mental wrestling of the Sophists, eristics, perhaps with Plato's anamnesis, and maybe even further back to the spontaneous dialectics in-use of the Presocratic philosophers of nature. 22 Theophrastus, Metaphysics (with transl., comment &amp; introd. by W. D. Ross and F. H. Forbes, 1929, Oxford). 23 I am grateful to Fil. Lie. Reiner Carls of the University of Goteborg (Philosophy) for having pointed this out to me. Some of what follows is based on discussions I had with him concerning the fate of Aristotle's doxographic induction in the Middle Ages when the Catholic Church established its ideological hegemony.</page><page sequence="24">32 Aant Elzinga No, the reason for the failure of a continuation of a critical tradition in science seems to me to be a failure of science in society. It does not lie in the ideal of certainty of knowledge itself; although I admit the contribu tory influence of such an ideal. The method continued in other intellectual realms, particularly in theology, which came to ascend the throne as queen of sciences. Criticism and great debates were not lacking there. There was the great struggle between platonicism and Aristotelicism, and also the struggle to "baptize" Aristotle, to place him into a Christian frame of reference. One should not forget the fact that Thomas Aquinus was charged with heresy because he had forsaken the "divine" Plato for the sake of Aristotle. It was just that these struggles which were the life-blood of intellectual life for a certain period, took place in another framework and another field than the one of Aristotle's scientific works. And if in many cases Aristotelian results were taken over uncritically this probably was more a sign of the total uninterest and lack of concern for this field, than an indication of the bewitching power inherent in the notion of episteme. The reason for the failure of a critical tradition continuing and developing science for so long thus has to be looked for in the social setting, where the cadre of learned persons regarded the persuit of scientific investigations over natural phenomena (as a rule) of only very marginal interest. Furthermore, how did feudalism, as it developed and was challenged form an authoritarian structure in society and leave a stamp on thinking even in the circles of the learned elite? I put these forward as hypotheses and questions which to me are more plausible than the notion of an intrinsic persuasive power of the ideal of certain knowledge. Historical research is required to check them. In summary, I do not think Aristotle killed dialectics. His mode of prospecting was a part of dialectical method, and as such an early form of a relation between theory and praxis which was later advanced (with mathematical model-making and experimental practice) further in the "new sciences" of Galileo's day. With Aristotle the inductive (collection) and classificatory (division) moments of early dialectics emerge clearly as distinct phases in research work. And they are paralleled by the two phase method of presentation of results, first historia, then aitia. The power of Aristotle's theory of research is witnessed by the results, a body of knowledge synthesizing many conflicting views from previous generations. It contributed to a paradigm of how to argue "scientifically" according to the deductive ideal. And it helped coin "scientific" language. This language lived on in terminology even after the revolution in science of the 16th and 17th centuries.</page><page sequence="25">Some remarks on a theory of research in the work of Aristotle 33 10. AGAINST FEYERABEND'S ANARCHY Galileo too still used a kind of doxographic induction. I prefer to call it methodological anamnesis2**. He used it when he presented his pro Copernican arguments in the form of dialogues. In these dialogues he too drew on earlier warranted and expert opinion and "experience" for his background knowledge, and showed how these forced the mind into a certain perspective, that of the "new mechanics". But if he, like Aristotle, started from common experience, why did Galileo arrive at a different result ? I think the answer in part lies in the social setting of contemporary society. It was a society seperated by two thousand years from Aristotle's. In these milennia much happened to change the infra-structure of society, and hence what was experienced as "common" and everyday experience. (And of course much might still have been the same). Social changes brought with them changes in the social setting of science, and in the world outlook which exerts a regulative influence. This is one aspect the theory of science has to take into con sideration. For different world outlooks may contribute to a focussing in different ways on the same "common experience", e.g. of things on a moving boat considered in analogy things on the earth. Galileo's dialogues have a function of providing the same kind of dialectical review of earlier background experience as Aristotle's doxographic induction. The way Simplicio, the representative of scholasticism is "led" reminds very much of Socrates' leading the slave boy to insight, in the Meno. And through the dialogue the reader too is drawn onward to a reassessessment of familiar experience, to interpret it theoretically in a different way; one may say, to interpret it after a new paradigm. The dialogue form of presentation of results helps to give full play to the methodological anamnesis, whereby the reader is allowed, without any coercion upon him, to become persuaded of the plausibility of a new paradigm. It is this that lends the method an element of persuasion. Galileo's methodological anamnesis has recently become a subject of metascientific discussion, initiated by a case study of Paul Feyerabend25. Feyerabend, in order to make a case for the notion of paradigm-shift conceived as a kind of gestallt switch, argues that Galileo's kinematical arguments in defense of the Copernican world system are only "propagan 24 Ernan McMullin calls Galileo's use of recollection in his dialogues anamnesis. See McMullin, "The History and Philosophy of Science", in Roger H. Struever ed., Historical and Philosophical Perspectives of Science (1970, Minneapolis), 35?41. He claims that Aristotle makes different interpretations in different contexts, a relativist one in the context of things moving on the boat, an absolutist one in the world-scheme con text. This is a contradiction within the Aristotelian paradigm itself, which he means contrib uted to the replacement of it. 25 Paul K. Feyerabend, "Problems of Empiricism II", in The Nature and Function of Scientific Theory, R. G. Colodny ed., 1970, Pittsburgh).

He plays up the persuasive element in Galileo's use of the dialectical technique of "recollection" in dialogues. According to Feyerabend it is no method, but a kind of trick anamnesis aimed at duping. He means that there is nothing rational in it; Galileo only uses it for propagandistic purposes to win people over to his position and para digm in the great struggle between representatives of the two world systems, the Ptolemaic-Aristotelian and the Copernican-Galilean. The Galilean discussion of events on a moving ship, he believes, is there only as a demagogical device to lead the readers to the point of no-return, beyond which they have the feeling that they knew all along the principle of shared motions and the Galilean principle of relativity of motion. With the help of the Galilean dialogues it is made to seem as if they have it re-called out of a dim intuitive awareness that existed the whole time. I can agree with Feyerabend that the dialogues have this persuasive function, of drawing the reader into a frame of mind or perspective. But I cannot agree that it is pure and sole propagandistic trickery. For a standpoint and theory lie behind it. I want to claim that in actual fact this methodological anamnesis which one may reconstruct from Galilean dia logues is far from proving Feyerabend's case for a theoretical anarchism. On the contrary to me it suggests that Galileo continued a part of the dialectical method I have attributed to Aristotle, doxographic induction. It only goes to show that the dialectical method has a long history, from the Presocratics to the seventeenth century, though the research motivating interest, and the world outlook backing it up and legitimating it at different times may have varied considerably; and so also the main region of application. It goes to show that scientific enterprice always has in it a rational kernel which is intimately associated with methodology. Furthermore it suggests a certain degree of continuity and development in method26. To come back to my point concerning Popper's suggested interpretation of the role of the idea of episteme with Aristotle: I mean that to give a full answer to such a question as the purported death of a "critical rational" (dialectical) method or its "renaissance" with Galileo, we have to explode the traditional frame of reference of meta-scientific discussions. I realize that the Popper group and also Feyerabend has taken an impor tant step in this direction with their propagation, by example, for a criticism and growth approach27. However I believe we must widen the scope still more. It seems that the hermeneutic dialectical tradition in 26. see further my, On a research program in early modern physics. 27 In an important recent paper Popper has criticized the subjective idealism of empiri criticists (including the modern, so called logical empiricists). He proposes instead an objective idealism which attributes an objectivity and autonomy to problems, arguments, ideas, theories, etc. These are supposed to exist in a "third world", in which science largely generates its own theoretical problematics and problem shifts.

This tradition, which has the last years clenched in a theoretical struggle with modern positivism and the critical rationalism of Popper (wherefrom it has at the same time absorbed insights into the inner dialectics of research), points to the neccessity of investigating the communication relations in the ideal typical community of research workers. They make the important distinction between authoritarian and critical-democratic relations. The former type is associated with the tendency to dogmatism, the latter with the tendency to criticism (in a non-nihilist sense). In the real community of investigators these two tendencies are both present. The problem becomes the one of determining which social factors reinforce the one or the other. In the case of Galileo this is not irrelevant either. My ulterior motive for belaboring this point is to underscore a meta scientific stand as a point of departure for the theory of science. This is that in order to answer certain interesting and important questions in our field, our own program must include a study of the social setting of science, even if this task may be deemed as only marginal28. 11. ONE-METHOD OR METHODOLOGICAL PLURALISM? A problem of interpretation in connection with Aristotle's theory of science. Some recent discussion in the theory of science has revolved around the subject of theoretical pluralism. This is a doctrine that suggests science grows around several theories as crystallization points simultane ously, and these theories are competitors. Now it is unlikely that Aristotle subscribed to theoretical pluralism. Each branch of science according to him should arise from a classification of phenomena observed in studying a specific territory of reality. And for each of these territories there should be one true theory which reflected the structure of reality; though the starting point could be varied. However the question may arise if each branch has its own method, or if there is one general method which is common to all scientific investi gations? In other words, can one speak of a methodological pluralism? There has been some discussion concerning Aristotle's view on this point. Some of it stems from a difficulty of interpretation of a text. The example is also interesting in as far as it shows that in some cases of text interpreta tion the classical scholar is well served by an insight in the theory of research. When it concerns ancient "scientific" texts hermeneutic under standing may have to include understanding of theory of science. 28 This standpoint has become programmatic at the Inst, f. Theory of Science at the University of Goteborg. cp. my "Huygens' theory of research and Descartes' theory of Knowledge", op. cit. 3*</page><page sequence="28">36 Aant Elzinga In this treatise, On the Parts of Animals, which contains a methodolog ical discussion, Aristotle poses the following question: "Ought the writer who deals with the works of nature follow the plan /method/ adopted by the mathematicians in their astronomical demon strations, and after considering the phenomena presented by animals and their several parts, proceed subsequently to treat of the causes and the reasons why; or ought he to follow some other method?" (I 1, 639b, 6-10). This question is interesting, and historically of some importance. His answer according to our interpretation is, yes. From the question we learn that Aristotle understood the mathematical astronomers as starting from a description of phenomena before proceeding on to a treatment of causes. It may be recalled that Plato gave instructions as to how these descriptions were to be attempted ? viz. using systems of circles which kinematically approximate the paths of the "wanderers" (planets). The motivating world-outlook reason was that the circle was a fundamental building unit in the structure of the heavens. This was called "saving the appearances". Later some astronomers took an agnostic attitude. They saw the systems of description using circles as nothing more than convenient instruments for arranging perceptual data; it must not be taken to correspond to a fine-structure of reality. This has also been termed an instrumentalist position regarding theories. It was not Aris totle's position. He was an "essentialist". He believed astronomical theory must reflect or reveal deeper essences of nature29. Now the usual translation of what may seem to be Aristotle's answer to the above question is as follows: "The mode of necessity, however, and the mode of rationation are different in natural science from what they are in the theoretical sciences; ... for in the latter the starting-point is that which is; in the former that which is to be" (639b, 30-640b 10). The distinction rests on the difference between being and becoming, two of Aristotle's basic conceptual constructs. The passage suggests then that, even if there is not total methodological pluralism, in the sense of one method for every field of scientific endeavour, there are however two distinct modes of reasoning corresponding to two groups of science. The commentator30 suggests Aristotle means that, in theoretical science one starts with what "is" and from it in premises one reasons (forwards) by deduction to certain conclusions. By contrast in the other case one has to do with what is "becoming", and starting from an ideal conception of plan of it, one reasons backwards, to find the antecedent 29 Essentialism is Popper's term. 30 De par. an. transl. under editorship of J.

Once the chain from the ideal which is to be, back to what is the case at present is grasped theoretically, the next phase, a constructive one can begin to produce the desired result. Now clearly this comment does not support the case that there is a difference here between theoretical and natural science. It only indicates a difference between theoretical and constructive sciences. Aristotle distinguished three basic types of inquisitive activity: episteme (reflecting faculty); techne (acting faculty); poeisis (creative faculty). Science in the highest sense of the word was restricted to knowledge arising from contemplation (episteme)zl. Constructive science ? like engineering and medicine ? grips into a process in order to change it in accordance with a goal or plan. Against this as background, and noting that Aristotle exemplifies his statement with an illustration from medicine, it seems more likely that During is right when he says that the usual translation is wrong, and he suggests the following instead: "Yet in physical science as well as in theoretical sciences the method of demonstration and the mode of necessity are different" ? that is different from the constructive sciences (not different from each other)32. But even if this suggests a broad division of sciences according to method, it still does not imply that biology and mathematical astronomy have exactly the same method. Within the group of non-constructive sciences there may still be individual differences, depending on the subject matter, if it is "being" or "becoming". The obvious difference would be between deduction (in mathematics) and induction (in natural science). This is to some extent supported by the following passage: "Mathematical accuracy is not to be demanded in everything but only in things which do not contain matter. Hence this method (of mathe matics) is not that of natural science, because presumably all nature is concerned with matter" (Metaphys. 995a, 15f.). This suggests that if demonstration is to be carried out in accordance with the deductive ideal of science, different degrees of rigour are possible depending upon "empirical" or "formal" subject matter. Here again it is a question of a duality, and not full pluralism of method. Furthermore the division applies to the context of justification, or demonstration. Nothing is said of similarities or differences in regard to 31 see above. Also, A. Antweiter, Der Begriff der Wissenschaft bei Aristoteles (1936, Bonn).

Presumably in all of them one might begin with historia before proceeding to aitiai or causes (above, p. 22). Finally, if we look at Aristotle's classification of theoretical science, it is found that there are three main groups: Physics: i.e., natural sciences including what we today distinguish into cosmology, physics, chemistry and biology, all in one. It was the science of "motion" in the broadest sense. Mathematics: including geometry, astronomy, mechanics, optics, harmonics. Philosophy: especially first philosophy, having to do with the search for archai the first principle of the world. Aristotle recognized philosophy as a kind of mother science, having an incubating function for the growth of other sciences. Analytics was not regarded as a system of knowledge, but rather an heuristic or Organon, an instrument for all sciences. In the later develop ments in the history of science it came to go into the sciences on par with them. This was a change of Aristotle's position, for whom it belonged to another dimension, as analytical tool. What I have arrived at is that Aristotle did not subscribe to methodo logical pluralism, even if some interpretations of him may point a little in this direction. What I have tried to show is that a plausible interpreta tion calls for a certain amount of reconstruction of Aristotle's theory of science (which includes in it a theory of research that is implicit in his work).
