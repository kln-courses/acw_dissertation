Zycinski* Abstract: Interpreting John Paul IPs message to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences in the context of the new scientific discoveries concerning the mitochondrial DNA, one can argue that the human species emerged in Africa some 200,000 years ago. The very problem of the emergence of the human soul in the process of biological evolution represents a subject outside the cognitive competence of science. Attempts can be under- taken to explain this issue in the epistemological perspective of philosophy and theology. In traditional versions of evolutionary theism, God's interaction in nature was inter- preted in causal categories when deterministic dependences were stressed in the process of evolutionary growth. In new proposals, God's presence in an evolving nature has been explained in categories of potentialities and propensities built by God into an evolving Nature. Consequently, in this approach God could be conceived not as a Paleyan designer but rather as a composer unfolding the possibilities hidden in His creation. The future of the evolutionary process depends not only on cosmic physical determinants; it depends to a large extent on the quality of cooperation of human actions with the influence of the Divine Creator. Accordingly, the shape of human culture, as well as the state of moral consciousness of Homo sapiens, should be taken into consideration to discuss the future evolution of the human species.

Introduction October 1996, in his message to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, John Paul II presented the current attitude of the Catholic Church to the scientific theory of evolution. Going beyond the position defined in 1950 by Pius XII in Humani Generis, he emphasized that at the present time the evolutionary theory cannot be regarded only as one of many hypotheses, because numerous indepen- dent scientific disciplines confirm the idea of an evolving nature. Leaving aside statements that seemed cautious in the context of the scientific research of the early 1950s, John Paul II does not follow Humani Generis' claim that both the evolutionary and the non-evolutionary theories should be treated seriously. In the radically new perspective of contemporary scientific discoveries, it seems impos- sible to treat seriously the non-evolutionary theories when relativistic cosmology, palaeontology, molecular biology, genetics and many other disciplines provide new confirmations for the image of an evolving nature. The convergence of independent scientific discoveries is regarded by the Pope as a significant argument in favor of evolution theory (John Paul II, 1996). Christian recognition of evolutionary ideas does not, however, eliminate im- portant questions dealing with cultural, philosophical and theological aspects of the process of evolution. It was Czeslaw Mitosz, the Nobel prize winner in litera- ture in 1980, who a few years after John Paul ITs message on evolution expressed fears typical of many humanists. He said: "I do not understand how the Vatican can recognize the theory of evolution, because the biological sciences are the crowning point of the Enlightenment and create almost insurmountable difficulties because they blur the line dividing human beings from other living creatures" (Milosz, 2001). This very statement is a typical expression of the humanist opposition to the explanatory patterns adopted in modern science. In scientific practice one tries to Revista Portuguesa de FHosofia 61*2005 [212]</page><page sequence="3">Christian Theism and Cosmic Evolution 213 reduce the content of human culture to the level of physical and biological phenomena, ignoring the cultural Rubicon which divides the human person from the rest of the animal world. The recognition of these scientific discoveries does not imply denying the specificity of human culture if only, in looking for the philosophical meaning of evolutionary processes, one goes beyond explanations provided by the natural sciences. To avoid facile opposition between science and philosophy, it is necessary to distinguish between methodological and the ontological naturalism. Already in the time of Galileo, the former was recognized as a necessary component of scientific methodology. The latter transforms methodology into a concealed metaphysics which dominates in the well known bestsellers of Richard Dawkins or Edward O. Wilson. In this paper, I acknowledge the necessity of methodological naturalism on the level of scientific explanation. At the same time, however, the possibility of accepting any version of ontological naturalism is definitely excluded as inadequate to express the specificity of human consciousness. Finally, I propose as the most adequate ontological explanation the standpoint of Christian theism in its novel forms inspired by Whitehead, Peacocke, Haught and Edwards. Between methodology and metaphysics In pre-Galilean scientific methodology, references to the natural sciences and to theology were combined together and at the same time God's action in nature was regarded as an explanatory factor when scientists could not identify any natural phenomena capable of explaining the observable effects. Such a procedure was recognised as erroneous in later stages of scientific development because many phenomena that were supposed to be explained theistically later found a natural explanation. God who was introduced initially as the only necessary cause became later merely an useless hypothesis when gaps in the scientific picture were filled by new scientific discoveries. The explanatory appeal to a God of the gaps, who enters in world's history mainly by occasional interventions, was clearly inconsistent with methodological principles of modern science adopted already by Galileo. Though he never denied the value of theological explanation, Galileo argued in his Dialogue that, for methodological reasons, all supernatural factors must be excluded from the domain of astronomical research. If, for instance, in the spirit of medieval astronomy, one refers to the role of angels to explain the motion of planets, one could always introduce the hypothesis of angels to explain any set of empirical data. As a result, in such an approach, astronomy would remain merely a branch of an applied angelology (Favaro, 1890). Galileo's methodological distinctions implied what is now called the principle of methodological positivism. This principle claims that in scientific explanation of natural phenomena Nu for methodological reasons, one should refer only to Revista Portuguese de Filosofia I [213] 61-2005 1211-223</page><page sequence="4">214 Joseph M. Zycinski another set of natural phenomena N2 and cannot refer to non-physical factors. There is no ontological commitment in such a standpoint and one cannot claim that only natural phenomena are real. Consequently, the principle of methodological naturalism, also called the principle of methodological positivism, does not exclude philosophical explanations in which one introduces reference to God or to factors which cannot be described in the language of the natural sciences. It was Arthur Eddington who warned his colleagues at the beginning of the 20th century that the physicist who would consider his wife exclusively as a physical object and would describe her solely in the language of physics, runs the risk of experiencing a very sudden change of matrimonial status. The same human person can be described from the point of view of physics as a collection of orbiting electrons, from the point of view of biology as a member of the species of Homo sapiens, and from the theological point of view as a child of God endowed with the possibility of enjoying eternal life. These points of view are not mutually exclusive, but complementary ones. One should not therefore create artificial conflicts, but rather search for ways to go beyond the limited perspective of each of these disciplines in order to gain the full truth about reality. Consequently, one cannot accept the scientific description of nature as a brute fact. In understanding the deepest meaning of the cosmic evolution as well as the emergence of the human person with its unique spiritual propensities we have to refer to both scientific theories and philosophical reflection, to discover the integral truth about evolution of the representatives of Homo sapiens. Ockham's razor and overcoming ontological naturalism There are domains of human life which cannot be reduced to the level of phy- sical processes. For instance, it is impossible to express the essence of Hayden's string quartets by defining the physical parameters concerning the friction of the bow as it strikes the strings. Such a description in no way evokes the feeling of fascination and wonder which we feel as we return home from a concert. There is a truth about human life which can be neither defined in physical terms nor described by mathematical formulae. There is an important truth of human existen- ce which can only be discovered by philosophical search, theological reflection, aesthetic wonder and contemplation of human life. Scientists' comments concerning the amazing role of mathematics in describing physical processes provide the classical example of the cognitive approach called by Einstein "cosmic mysticism". Its origins can be defined on the level of reflection on "the miracle of the comprehensibility of the world" (Einstein, 1978). Paul C. Davies, when awarded the Templeton Prize, referred to this aesthetic- -mystical aspect of scientific experience: "It is impossible to be a scientist, even an atheist scientist, and not be struck by the awesome beauty, harmony and ingenuity of nature. What most impresses me is the existence of the underlying mathematical Revista Portuguesa cfe Filosofia 61-2005 [214]</page><page sequence="5">Christian Theism and Cosmic Evolution 215 order... How can one accept a scheme of things so cleverly arranged, so subtle and felicitous, simply as a brute fact, as a package of properties that just happens to be? Of course, science cannot prove the existence of a design, or a designer, but it can reveal the sheer depth of ingenuity that goes to make up this marvelous universe" (Mott, 1955). In the framework indicated, one recognizes the diversity of cognitive pers- pectives in which truth has been discovered. Newton and Einstein made great contributions to our knowledge of nature. We have been able to deepen this knowledge thanks to geometrical and logical contributions offered by Euclid, Gauss, Kurt Godel and many others. Our understanding of the world however would be incomplete and very much the poorer were it not for the philosophical contributions of Plato and Thomas Aquinas, the theological works of Saint Augustine and Karl Rahner, the mystical experiences of John of the Cross and Thomas Merton's reflections on spirituality. If one were to eliminate these latter elements from human culture, then we would be left with a profoundly warped and one-dimensional culture. In the past there were attempts to defend such an am- putation of culture, for example in Leninism. History has definitively falsified such ideological practices. The role of heterogeneous elements must be recognized in determining the ontological constituents of the world. In contemporary philosophy, Ockham's razor is used much more often than is Lenin's practice to question the value of those philosophical interpretations of natural phenomena which provide counterproposals to ontological naturalism. The methodological principle well-known as Ockham's razor expresses our belief in epistemological simplicity and economy of explanation. Its defenders often argue: why refer to extra-physical factors in philosophical explanations when it is simpler to reduce the complex phenomena to basic physical constituents? One should always remember that Ockham's razor, is methodological in nature, not doctrinal. It can inspire effective research procedure; but it cannot provide simple answers to complicated philosophical questions. Even on the level of physical research, this very principle often played a heuristically negative role. Its critics indicate many examples of the disadvantageous consequences of its application in science. It is true that in the 19th century the appeal to Ockham's razor retarded the development of extragalactic astronomy by nearly a century. Dogmatic adherents of Ockham's principle argued at that time that there are no extragalactic objects because all observed astronomical phenomena can be explained more economically by reference to the objects in our Galaxy. This search for simplicity resulted in a false cosmological model and seriously delayed the growth of extragalactic astronomy. As a result, in the contemporary philosophy of science a special "de-Ockhami- zation" program has been promoted in which the Ockham's principle has a relative, not an absolute value. In particular, in the philosophical search for satisfactory explanation of the emergence of human species one cannot be satisfied with Revista Portuguese de FUosofia I [215] 61*2005 1 21 1-223</page><page sequence="6">216 Joseph M. Zycinski providing the simplest possible explanations but has to refer to such factors that would adequately explain the nature of human consciousness with its moral sensitivity, aesthetic awareness and metaphysical concerns, which do not seem to be particularly useful in the biological struggle for survival. The scientific image of the evolution of Homo sapiens In the middle of the 19th century, Darwin's contemporaries were convinced that the universe was not more than six thousand years old. Darwin himself did not differentiate between the content of the Old Testament and the naive calculations of the Anglican archbishop James Usher contained in "Annales Veteris et Novi Testamenti", according to which the cosmos was created on 28 October 4004 BC. Today we realise that the universe in its present form is 13.7 billion years old. In the course of time since Darwin's death, it was necessary to multiply the age of the universe by a factor of 2.5 million. The palaeontologists who were contemporaries of Darwin realised that the Archbishop Usher's estimates were false; they believed however that it was enough to multiply them by a factor of about a hundred. At that time, the discovery that cosmic evolution has been taking place for billions of years would have been unthinkable. Today an immense universe evolving for billions years has been regarded as "our cosmic habitat" (Ress, 2001). It brings important philosophical, theological and cultural issues which should be discussed in the context of new scientific discoveries concerning the biological evolution of the human species. Africa is the continental homeland of our species. About seven million years ago our humanlike ancestors accepted a bipedal style of walking, which gave them the opportunity to use their upper limbs to manipulate tools. As a result of a biological process called "adaptive radiation", groups of hominids called Austra- lopithecus africanus and Australopithecus robustus emerged. A little bit more than two million years ago, the increase in their brain size brought the first represen- tative of the genus Homo, classified as Homo habilis. Whereas representatives of the species Australopithecine died out a million years ago, the representatives of species of Homo survived. Over a million years ago in what is now Kenya, there emerged Homo erectus - the first hominid who used fire, practiced systematic hunting and made stone tools. His descendants later reached Java, Europe and the area of present-day Beijing. It is significant that no genetic traces of the descendants of this first Homo erectus have so far been found. Some authors suggest that a primeval holocaust took place, described in a dramatic way in the biblical account of the death of Cain. According to the dominant scientific theories, modern Homo sapiens evolved in Africa from Homo erectus about 200,000 years ago. Specifically, a number of studies in the field of the genetics of mitochondrial DNA have allowed us to state that the human species emerged in Africa some 200,000 years ago. These genetic Revista Portuguesa de FUosofia 61*2005 [2|6]</page><page sequence="7">Christian Theism and Cosmic Evolution 217 estimates have not yet been backed up by the necessary evidence from archaeo- logical digs. Archaeological discoveries so far provide us with evidence of considerably later stages of the development of our species. The scientific research confirms the hypothesis of the second human exodus out of Africa. A second wave of migration out of Africa took place about 100,000 years later. After moving to Asia our ancestors spread eastward, reaching New Guinea and Australia about 50,000 years ago. Thus, in our biological lineage we all come from Africa, even though from the cultural point of view we find more interesting elements of our heritage in ancient Greece. Human transcending the natural order The existence of the human species constitutes only a minute part of cosmic evolution. More than 99.9% of the history of the universe occurred without the presence of a human observer. The human person appeared very late in the process of cosmic evolution. Pessimists consider our species to be a mere ephemeron, which will quickly disappear because of our inability to adapt to the conditions of cultural evolution which, for contemporary humankind, seems to be more im- portant than biological evolution. While the biological evolution of our species was conditioned by the principle of the struggle for survival, in the Hellenic cultural heritage there are many elements which in no way can be related to the attainment of a biological advantage. Among these elements one could mention metaphysics, ethics, mathe- matics and aesthetics. In the struggle for biological survival, such topics as the geometrical definition of a dimensionless point and the metaphysical questions concerning arche and the structure of being seem relatively irrelevant. In undertaking these issues, our ancestors moved far from the question of pragmatic concerns. They stressed the role of spiritual self-awareness inspired by the principle of gnothi seauthon. They accentuated the role of the Socratic moral judgements and dilemmas of conscience. They sought mathematical canons of sophisticated beauty which are utterly unrelated to biological conditioning. It was in ancient Greece that our predecessors asked the questions which brought no practical benefits. They dealt with the ontological structure of being, the invisible world of meaning, and the harmony between biological and spiritual values. In this passionate theoretical reflection one finds an important truth about the essence of the human person. The human person, created by God in accordan- ce with the natural laws of evolution, transcends the rest of nature through our ability to reflect, which gives us access to the wealth of the spiritual world. Transcending the biological struggle for survival, the human person has developed an ethical sensitivity. In contrast to the lower animals, man has developed his ability for metaphysical reflection. Only man, endowed by God with the breath of immortality, has created modern science. Revista Portuguese de FHosofia I [2(7] 61-2005 | 21 1-223</page><page sequence="8">218 Joseph M. Zycinski While remaining a subject to the laws of biology and physics, human beings have been able to create a rich world of spiritual values, art, poetry and beauty. At the same time, however, human beings have been able to create concentration camps, to threaten people with the charge of being an enemy of the working class, and to seek the final solution of the Jewish problem by completely exterminating our Jewish brothers and sisters. To interpret the complex truth of human existence, many scientists go beyond methodological naturalism when they interpret those aspects of human existence which cannot be adequately explained in physical terms. Their approach remains consistent with the philosophical explanation of the cultural specificity of human existence. Regarding the specificity of human culture, one has to acknowledge in the philosophical framework that the human species has been intellectually oriented towards transcendent goals, even if the latter do not bring any immediate empirically determined benefits. In this orientation, the essence of human culture is expressed. It constitutes the very core of our existence, traditionally described by such concepts as animal rationale or homo meditans. To explain philosophically this specificity of our being, Christian theism traditionally refers to the immaterial human soul created by God. John Paul II, in his message of 1996, prefers philosophical terminology in which the emergence of human consciousness is described as an "ontological discontinuity" or an "ontological leap" (Coyne, 1998). On the level of observable phenomena, this very process of creation was expressed in the emergence of the human self. One should not, however, interpret this process through simplistic anthropomorphic models in which the philosophical truth of God's immanence in nature is ignored. The emergence of the human being in an evolutionary context To explain the emergence of human consciousness in the process of biological evolution, one has to exclude reference both to the God of the gaps which becomes a useless hypothesis after new scientific discoveries have been made and to the arbitrary opposition between God and the laws of physics. Such an opposition is ungrounded if we recognize the doctrine of God's immanence in nature, so important for Christian theism. Already at the end of the 19th century, in his critique of the philosophical concept of God's special creation, Aubrey L. Moore emphasized that the Darwinian theory of evolution seems to be closer to Christian theism than the traditional philosophical theory of "special creation' because the former implies the permanent immanence of God in the evolving nature. He argued: "Those who oppose the doctrine of evolution in defence of a 'continued intervention' of God, seem to have failed to notice that a theory of occasional intervention implies as its correlative a theory of ordinary absence" (Moore, 1989). A century later, this lack of logical consistency in explaining God's immanence in nature was still a real problem. In 1991, when addressing the same issue, Owen Revista Portuguesa de FHosofia 61 â¢ 2005 [218]</page><page sequence="9">Christian Theism and Cosmic Evolution 219 Thomas admitted sarcastically: 'Theologians continue to talk a great deal about God's activity in the world, and there continue to be only a very few who pause to consider some of the many problems involved in such talk" (Thomas, 1991). Thomas' critique was formulated before George V. Coyne of the Vatican Obser- vatory and his collaborators at Notre Dame, Indiana and at Berkeley's Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences originated a sophisticated research program concerning scientific perspectives on divine action within the framework of evolutionary and molecular biology, quantum cosmology, the physics of deterministic chaos, neurophysiology, etc. This research provides radically new conceptual patterns for understanding God's immanence in nature and the large spectrum of possible forms of cooperation between supernatural and natural causes. In this approach, laws of nature are not God's antagonists but the most evident expressions of His immanence in nature; both causal and teleological processes disclose this immanence. There is no need to refer to the anthropomorhic design argument, as it was suggested in its classical version by William Paley, because the divine design could assume much more sophisticated forms (Pennock, 2001). In its new version, the evolving universe is not subjected to one rigid design in which all details are pre-established by the Creator. There is in it also an element of an artistic touch which cannot be expressed in the language of algorithmic rationality but has been actualised in non-linear evolution and unpredictable bifurcations. The future of this design depends not only on the decision of the divine Designer but also on the cooperation between the Creator and the creation which is introduced in an unended process directed towards evolutionary consummation. The very problem of the emergence of the human soul in the process of biolo- gical evolution, as Stephen Jay Gould rightly declares, "represents a subject outside the magisterium of science" (Gould, 1997). Scientific evidence suggests only that there is no expression of reflective consciousness, no kind of ritual or rite prior to 100,000 years ago. Already at about that epoch the Neanderthals practiced deliberate burial, which is usually interpreted as belief in continued human existence after biological death. There are also authors who suggest that Homo erectus must have reached a relatively high level of consciousness because the large size of his brain, as well as his linguistic skills make him essentially different from chimpanzees (Leakey, 1994). Practically, nonetheless, there is no methodological possibility of justifying philosophically the belief that, to explain the behaviour of Homo erectus and/or Homo neandertalensis, one has to refer necessarily to an immaterial component in their being. In answering the question when exactly human consciousness emerged in the life of our animal ancestors from the standpoint of Christian theism, one has to remember to avoid an erroneous understanding of the very term "exactly": 1. We have to avoid anthropomorphisms in understanding the creation of the human soul by God as a special intervention. It must not be seen as special in a Revista Portuguese de Filosofia I [2|9] 6i -2005 1 21 1-223</page><page sequence="10">220 Joseph M. Zycinski sense that eliminates universal principles of God's interaction with natural causes and His immanence in universal laws of nature. The so called "special nature of this intervention" refers to the human frame of reference not to the divine one. What seems "special" for human observers remains "universal" in the set of principles founded by the divine Creator. 2. One should not temporarily identify the emergence of the human self, irreducible to biological factors, with the empirical expression of this qualitatively new level of human existence. In the biological evolution of the human species, regularities similar to those found in the development of the individual human organism could function. Though nobody questions the existence of a human soul in a newly born child, there is no cogent evidence of intellectual reflection or language skills in such a child. Accordingly, we could suppose that the creation of a specifically human self in the evolutionary process of the growth of our species should not be identified with the first acts of intellectual reflection demonstrated by an archaic Homo sapiens. Consistently, to understand the emergence of human soul in evolutionary growth of humankind one can refer to Karl Rahner's understanding of active self-transcendence. In the framework suggested, the so called "immediate creation" of the human soul is expressed in making each person unique in one continuous process of creation subject to universal laws and oriented from within by an immanent God to the continuous growth of the spiritual human person. God in an evolving nature In traditional versions of evolutionary theism, God's interaction in nature was interpreted in causal categories when deterministic dependences were stressed in the process of evolutionary growth. In new proposals, God's presence in an evol- ving nature has been explained in categories of potentialities and propensities built by God into an evolving Nature. Consequently, in this approach God could be conceived not as a Paleyan designer but as a composer unfolding the possibilities hidden in His creation. Arthur Peacocke (Peacocke, 1993) and Denis Edwards compare his role to the improvising artist who demonstrates his unsurepassed ingenuity in disclosing a new beauty contained in the initial composition. In this aesthetic model of evolution, God appears at the same time as a composer as well as a conductor. He not only determines the patterns of harmony which can be actualized in human life but also helps us to actualize them. The specificity of His cooperation with the human person is expressed in His respect for our right to extemporized composition. The consequences of this respect may be expressed both in the creative novelty contributed by human person to the richness of life and the specific beauty discovered in human existence as well as in the accidental disharmony of this existence dependent on illusions inevitable in our life. The approach suggested remains close to Whitehead's process philosophy where God is understood as the Poet of an evolving universe (Whitehead, 1957). Revista Portuguesa cfe Filosofia 61 â¢ 2005 [220]</page><page sequence="11">Christian Theism and Cosmic Evolution 221 He introduces into an evolving nature His own canons of cosmic growth, but does not imposes them deterministically. God's action should be conceived in a persuasive rather than in a coercive manner. His creativity, expressed in divine "persuasion", recognizes the autonomy of created beings and brings proposals of evolutionary growth which need not be necessarily followed in the process of human evolution. To avoid the risk of new anthropomorhisms in philosophical reference to persuasion, creativity, and self-transcendence or the traditionally understood Omega Point of Teilhard's cosmology, one may use the analogies of nonlinear ther- modynamics and conceive God as an evolutionary attractor. The state to which the nonlinear thermodynamic evolution of physical systems tends is called an ,,attractor" because in the entire evolution of the system it behaves as if it would attract the other stages of the dynamical growth (Zycinski, 2000). When we conceive the persuasive role of God in evolution as the role of a cosmic attractor, we stress that He directs all processes towards future unactualised goals; by a cosmic attraction He includes them in His divine purposes. Such a form of cosmic directedness is much more sophisticated than that suggested in the traditional argument of design. In new models proposed in Christian theism, God understood as an evolutio- nary attractor shares with all creatures their own openness to a future that is not fully determined (Haught, 2000; Edwards, 1999). In this framework, one reco- gnizes the importance of physical necessity which, as instantiated in the laws of physics, turns out to be a form of God's immanence in nature. The cosmic order, that inspired so many physicists to express their astonishment with the rational structure of physical processes, discloses divinity hidden in the evolving nature. The acceptance of God's immanence in the laws of nature does not preclude the doctrine of divine transcendence. A God hidden in physical and biological laws cannot be pantheistically reduced to the level of natural order. To contend that He is more than the order of nature, we must not, however, deny His immanent presence in observed regularities. God's immanence in nature as well as His transcendence can be reconciled in the so called philosophy of panentheism (Clayton, Peacocke, 2004). There are various versions of panentheism. In its most general form this philosophy contends that the being of God is not only immanent in nature, by including the whole universe and permeating it, but also transcendent, in the sense that the universe does not exhaust God's being. St. Paul can be regarded as its protagonist when he spoke of the world permeated by the immanent God in whom ,,we live, and move, and have our being" (Acts, 17:28) Meaning and creativity in cosmic evolution The awareness of the role of the human person, as seen from the perspective of the billions of years of cosmic evolution, helps us to look with a certain distance at Revista Portuguese de FHosofia [221] 61-2005</page><page sequence="12">222 Joseph M. Zycinski the new biotechnological dangers as well as at the commercial fascinations of the coming season. A sense of our profound connection with the world of nature protects us from cosmic alienation and in a natural way leads to the question concerning the highest criterion of value and of meaning. To overcome the facile opposition between the worlds of nature and culture we need new ontological patterns in which the reality of the harmony and meaning discovered in the human cosmic habitat will find its logical continuity on the level of the cultural activity of the human person. In this perspective, the rationality of nature, discovered in the billions of years of cosmic transformation, constitutes the domain of cosmic meaning discovered in the complementary cognitive perspectives of science and of philosophy. The process of evolution continues. At the present epoch, evolution proceeds to a large extent on the level of the human psyche, spirituality and recognition of values which make up our natural environment. It will depend on representatives of Homo sapiens whether the search for success and pleasure will dominate the human world or whether respect for human dignity, sympathy and solidarity with other people will become our principal values. On our planet the evolutionary development which proceeds for 4.8 billion years can be brutally interrupted if our sense of responsibility for the future of evolution does not correspond to the privileged role which is bestowed to Homo sapiens due to our reflection and moral sensitivity. In such a context we must recognize humanity's special role in a still unfinished process of evolution. The future of the evolutionary process is not the result of cosmic determinants; it depends to a large extent on the quality of cooperation of human actions with the influence of the Divine Creator. The future shape of human culture, as well as the state of moral consciousness of future generations of Homo sapiens, depend on this cooperation. There are reasons to expect that the evolutionary process, which only for a relatively short time occurs on the level of human consciousness, will find its fulfillment in an existence which will reveal the dignity of human life; if only we are courageous enough to join our human ancestors in their search for meaning, moral sensitivity, and truth.
