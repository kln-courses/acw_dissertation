<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 21  Shamanism and Totemism in Early Israel   Robert D. Miller II   The Catholic University of America, Washington, D.C.   Abstract  This essay examines the archaeology of religion for Early Iron Age  Israel in the light of ethnographic analogy. The anthropological  categories of shamanism and totemism provide a framework for best  explaining the archaeological data for this society, the highlands of  Palestine from 1200 to 1000 BCE, and for understanding the ritual and  religious life of this culture.   Introduction  SEVERAL IMPORTANT HISTORIES of early Iron Age Israel have appeared  in recent years.1 These provided archaeologically-based reconstructions of  early Israelite society and economics. Yet the “relatively few, highly  complex and ambiguity-ridden concepts around which the social  organization of a culture revolves and the emotional and intellectual  energy of its members is largely spent”2 have been largely ignored.3 That  is, religion, broadly defined, has been for the most part left to the study of  the biblical text alone.4  Archaeology, as the study of artifacts (including structures), is  keenly poised to explore the mental representations pertaining to artifacts  that are tied up with the practices for which they were used.5 The most  obvious example is archaeology of ritual, defined with Rappoport as “the  performance of more or less invariant sequences of formal acts and  utterances not entirely encoded by the performers.”6 But there is more. All  artifacts have a symbolic, ideological side ― distinct according to context  in most cases (ideology does not exist independently of material culture)  ― that can sometimes be seen in morphological analysis of those  artifacts.7  Sacred memory is regularly abetted by non-linguistic artifacts,  in both oral and textual cultures, and archaeology is also able to examine  this aspect of artifacts.8 Archaeology, therefore, can be a key resource in  reconstructing early Israelite religion.  The archaeology of religion will include both architecture of  special places and the artifacts associated with such places,9 although  “There are very few, if any, locations that categorically exclude either  ritual or mundane activities.”10 Significant also will be mortuary  information.11   Winter 2014  </page> <page sequence="2"> 22  Rather than simply catalog, we must explain the religion from the  artifacts. One could easily assume the biblical text provides such an  interpretation; it would be most difficult to prove that it does not. But such  information is inextricably bound with thick cultural concepts, intentions,  and concerns of the author’s own period and of many others before his  time.12 The biblical text cannot be used as a direct source for  reconstructing cultural concepts. Given the near impossibility of  identifying texts of a specific timeframe, let us explain the artefactual  evidence by ethnographic analogy.13 “The comparative approach does not  entail, a priori, any identification, full or partial, of the phenomena or  developments which are being compared.”14 But, “reconstructions cannot  be achieved without the help of the comparative method,”15 We cannot  simply “attempt, by inductive, empiricist research to infer the religion of  early Israel from supposedly objective archaeological data; no matter how  ‘objective’ a researcher tries to be or how well he or she knows the data,  the method produces only an illusion of objectivity and inevitability.”16  Ethnographic analogy will provide explanation of the  archaeological realia. But one should accept these analogies not merely  because of multiple areas of correspondence and sheer weight of parallels.  “The piling up of common attributes cannot be said to make one analogy  more probable than another.”17 Rather, the merit of the analogies derives  from seeing the same causal/determining mechanism in both societies,  Israel and the comparand, the same behavioral systems that produce  particular artefactual patterns.18 In what follows, then, I will outline the  artefactual evidence, and then use ethnographic analogy to explain Early  Israelite religion in terms of two recurring patterns of religious  representation found throughout human groups, shamanism and  totemism.19  Archaeology of Early Iron Age Israelite Religion  Since the archaeology of religion includes architecture of special  places and associated artifacts, let us first catalog ritual space in Iron I  Israel. The site of el-Burnat Sitti Salaamiyya, conveniently called for  several decades now “Mt. Ebal,” a single-period site on the eastern slope  of Mount Ebal, has three strata dating from the Late Bronze Age to the  mid-12th century B.C.E. What makes the site most interesting and the  focus of questions regarding its function, is a rectilinear structure from  Stratum IB (1200-1140 B.C.E.) of 323 square feet, with corners oriented  to the compass points, having no floor or entrance, filled with bones of  bulls, sheep, goats, and deer, ash, and pottery.20 On the southeast side of  Washington Academy of Sciences  </page> <page sequence="3"> 23  the structure is what may be a ramp, and there are well-paved, rectangular  courtyards around the structure on three sides.21 The percentage of pithoi  and jugs in the site’s pottery assemblage is higher than most Iron I  highland sites, and the percentage of cooking pots lower, while sickle  blades are completely absent.22 There is a large quantity of bones,  especially of deer bones.23 Most of the bones were burnt, with 44% of the  burned remains coming from the central structure, and 63% of the deer  bones coming from it.24 Deep cut marks on antlers and a disproportionate  amount of deer crania illustrate the intentional removal of antlers.25 It all  seems to add up to a large permanent altar. Mt. Ebal’s “structure” is  oriented to compass points and has a ramp like non-Iron I altars,26 but has  no altar horns, and no other altars have bone or ash fill.27 So,  acknowledging that ritual locations often host a variety of rituals for the  same group of people,28 Mt. Ebal is a cultic site of some sort, albeit not a  very “biblical” one in light of the compass orientation, the ritual use of  deer (kosher, but illicit for sacrifice), and some sort of liturgical(?) use of  their antlers.29  There may have been a Secondary Public Cult Room at Ai.30 At  the end of a street in Site D, there is tiny room #65 (8.5m x 2.5m), with a  bench at foot of its wall all the way around, where a 4-story tall 80cm tall  fenestrated incense burner with paws as a base was found.31 Analogous  pieces are Megiddo P6055 and others, two at Tell Qasile, and three at Beth  Shean.32 Inside the burner was a clay animal figure (#1091) of either a  greyhound dog or a jackal (not a mouse), similar to one found at  Taanach.33 Also in the room were a bowl for a cult stand, having a chalice  profile with a tang (#1054),34 a bovine figurine,35 and a bowl (#1055) with  flat base and a row of breasts around the carination. The form of this room  suggests, on the basis of ethnographic analogy, “a focus on transformation  via small group communitas performance rituals; strong smells in smoky,  enclosed spaces; and rites of initiation and myth telling.”36  The building at Tell el-Farah North/Tirzah (Level VIIa) that  Chambon called a temple in J6 (squares 487-491)37 is an Iron I house of a  type with a rectangular space bordered with rooms on three sides, the sides  set off by pillars and the end by a wall,38 although it is paved, has an  additional vestibule, and lies directly over the Middle Bronze Age temple.  There was a statuette made of bell bronze or Corinthian brass (silver- bronze alloy) found in the building in the shape of an anthropomorphic  goddess (#1.491).39 Such larger spaces, ethnographically, “were gathering  points for a group to participate in sensory, communal performances of  music ... (sound), incense (smell), and food (taste).”40  Winter 2014  </page> <page sequence="4"> 24  The so-called “Bull Site” is not an Iron I shrine.41 The pottery and  the flint assemblages are those of domestic habitations,42 although it did  produce an incense burner ― we will return to the “Bull” below. But a  serious concern is its dating. Although the excavator43 always referred to  the site single-period Iron I,44 an independent survey of the site found only  five percent of the sherds collected to be Iron I.45 And if Finkelstein’s  redating of “Einun” pottery to the Middle Bronze Age is correct, then 90%  of the pottery found at the site is Middle Bronze.46 Lawrence Stager is  correct that the “Migdal Temple” of Shechem is not from the Iron I  period.47  Overall, this amounts to few cult sites.48 This is especially clear in  comparison to clearly cultic Iron I buildings at Dan (Room 7082), Tell  Abu Hawam (T.30), Beth Shean (ST and NT), and Tel Qasile (XII, XI,  and X). But these, along with much of the data outlined by Albertz and  Schmitt in their Family and Household Religion, are all outside of the  central hill country to which most scholars would limit early Israel.49   Moving from locations to objects, the same artifact can be both  household cookware and a ritual vessel, depending on the cultural context  in which a person uses it.50 So to focus our gaze, “Objects can and do  manifest a religious function of one sort or another when they appear in  other identifiable cultic contexts such as temples, shrines, and  sanctuaries.”51  As for cult objects, beginning with things found in shrines or  tombs, note that the famous “bull” of the “Bull Site” was not found by  archaeologists but was a chance surface discovery by a soldier.52 It cannot  be reliably included. The Bull site did produce a ceramic incense burner  (if it is analogous to ones from Megiddo and Beth Shean) or model of a  shrine (if analogous to one at Tell el-Farah North)53 ― unless these are  Middle Bronze.  From a tomb at Dothan come two animal figurines and an  anthropomorphic lamp (#P1344) with a prone male human figure with  arms outstretched as if flying, wearing a crown of five clay globules, stuck  on the underside (Figure 1). There are no parallels. It is 16cm long, made  with applied clay in the imitation of a giant clam’s shell. Dothan tombs  also produced two jugs shaped like bulls (#P1237 and #P1232). We have  already listed a number of figurines from Ai Site D.     Washington Academy of Sciences  </page> <page sequence="5"> 25    Figure 1. Anthropomorphic lamp with prone male human figure from Dothan tomb.   If we expand the list to include figurines found outside of cultic  securely contexts, we will include Shiloh’s Iron I Building 335, with a  stand decorated with a leopard killing a deer, a figurative applique of a  horse, the head of a lion on a cooking pot, and a ram’s head on a krater  handle.54 At Ai’s Area B South Bench House, locus 1801.4, a figurine of a  goose 7.5cm long was found, similar to ones at Beth Shean (“Denyer  1976" Report in Nicol Museum of the Southern Baptist Theological  Seminary). A horse figurine was also found in the South Bench House.55  Two figurines of horses’ busts come from Bethel (#1054 from Room 308  and #1112 from uncertain locus) and a human figurine (#328 from locus  44).56 An “Astarte” plaque (#104) was also found there, although lacking  the divine symbols common on Late Bronze age equivalents.57 An  identical plaque was found at Dothan.  There was very little in the way of permanent cultic facilities in  early Israel, if these existed at all. Incense burners and their stands were  quite common.58 These stands and the associated figurines and chalices do  not present “elevated levels of sensory pageantry,” so much as suggest  regular use.59 This would suggest “frequently-performed rituals  accompanied by comparatively low levels of sensory pageantry.”60 There  is possible evidence of altars for the sacrifice of caprovids and a ritual use  of deer antlers. There is no ritual use of antlers in the Bible, and antlers do  not appear in Pardee’s list of ninety-two different objects mentioned as  offerings in Ugaritic texts.61 Deer skulls with antlers and separate antlers  were found in a temple at Hasanlu on the Iranian plateau, dated to the 11th- Winter 2014  </page> <page sequence="6"> 26  9th centuries BCE.62 Here, the phenomenon must be related to the  extensive deer iconography at the site, although its specific supernatural  significance is impossible to determine.63  Evidence for Shamanism  Searching the ethnographic world for ritual use of antlers shows  they are primarily connected with “Shamanism.”64 Masks are an essential  element of shamanism.65 In most shamanic cultures, the masks represent  the animal spirits and enhance the connection with them.66 Mongolian  shamans of the Empire period, however, wore antlers in their headwear as  a symbol of the struggle against Buddhism.67 Other shamans wore masks  of animals they intended to hunt, to ensure an adequate take for the  community.68   While some deer-spirit masks are completely theriomorphic, it is  also possible to affix real or artificial antlers to an anthropomorphic mask,  and there are examples from Siberia, the Q'eqchi' Maya, Hopewell (200  BCE-400 CE), and at the Spiro Mounds in Oklahoma (1200-1450 CE).69   Masks are a common artifact found in temples and graves  throughout Syria, Mesopotamia, and Iran.70 There are Humbaba masks  from Old Babylonian Kish, with the means to attach them to one’s face.71  There is a Late Bronze II mask from the Stelai Shrine at Hazor.72 Masks  have been found in Iron I Palestine at Philistine Temple 200 of Tel Qasile,  dated to the 11th century, and from 11th/10th-century Ashdod (Strata X-IX)  and 10th-century Tel Sera.73 There are countless examples from the Iron II  period (from Shuafat, Jerusalem, Beersheba, Achziv, etc.).74 There were  mask fragment found in the cultic area of Tel Dan from the so-called  “Bamah A,” which Biran connected with Jeroboam I. Dalia Pakman has  shown that the mask was originally fixed to an incense stand found  nearby. The mask in question, however, has no eyeholes and was not  intended to be worn.75   The function of these masks was always unclear.76 Reichert  thought they were used in ritual dances, as seems to have been the case in  Cyprus, representing “divine radiation.”77 Those from Hazor, Kition,  Enkomi, Kourion, and Sarepta were all found in or near sacred areas.78  Theriomorphic deer masks, with real antlers attached, are worn for dances  by the Yaqui and Mayo people of northern Mexico.79   Lucian says that ritual masks were used in the Attis cult at Syrian  Hierapolis (Dea Assyr., 15). Herodotus records their use in Egypt (II, 122).  A Beset mask is depicted on a female Sau, or healer, from a 17th-century  Washington Academy of Sciences  </page> <page sequence="7"> 27  BCE tomb near the Ramesseum.80 Also in the tomb was a box containing  medical papyri.81 A block from a 24th-century BCE tomb from Giza  depicts a procession of young dancers, scourged by a youth or a dwarf in a  Bes mask,82 similar to 19th-century BCE painted canvas Bes masks found  in a house at el-Lahun.83   Let us turn to the incense altars. Most “biblical archaeologists”  automatically relate these to “offering the pleasing odor of incense to the  Lord” (Exod 29:25; 29:41; Lev 1:9, 13, 17; 16:12; etc.). The later temple  in Jerusalem included an incense altar used for such purposes. But  continuity of material evidence for ritual practices does not necessarily  reflect a continuity of associated beliefs.84 Ethnographically, they seem  best suited for use in “smudging,” cleansing places, persons, or objects of  negative spiritual energies and inviting benevolent spirits.85 Raz Kletter  and Irit Ziffer have shown that incense was “used in Iron Age cults of the  Southern Levant much more commonly than previously believed.”86  Smudging is a key element of shamanic healing.87  In Mongolia, each shaman has his (or her88) own complex recipe  for the burning material.89 Common burning materials for smudging  worldwide include Artemisia (wormwood), which was abundant in the  Judean Desert, Foothills of Samaria, and Plain of Sharon in the Iron I  period, and most importantly juniper, which in Iron I grew in the Foothills  of Samaria, the Plain of Sharon, and the Southern Nablus Syncline.90  Egypt was aware of Palestine as a source of “incense,” storax or mastic  incense (cf. Gen 37:25), as an ostracon from the Ramesseum bears the  inscription ntr sntr h3rw, “incense from Khor [Syria-Palestine].”91 There  is no need to depend on imported frankincense (Boswellia sp.). Myrrh was  also indigenous in the Iron I highlands and extensively marketed in later  periods.92 Juniper (Mong. arca) is the essential smudging fuel in  Mongolian shamanism for purification of small votive figurines,93 and in  Baloch and Kashmiri shamanism for inducing ecstatic trances.94  There is evidence for similar uses of incense in the ancient Near  East. Incense was used in Egypt to fumigate the Uraeus of the Mortuary  Temple of Ramesses III, as a means of purification.95 When Piye  conquered Memphis, he purified the city by burning incense in it.96  Papyrus Smith describes smudging with `ntyw resin and sntr resin incense  to cure a woman of delayed menstruation.97  In Mesopotamia, the term for incense in general is qutrinnu, from  the root qatāru, which in the D-stem means, “to let go up in smoke.”98  The root seems to be more tied to fumigation than offering,99 and incense  Winter 2014  </page> <page sequence="8"> 28  frequently appears in Mesopotamian purification texts.100 It is unclear if  the Hebrew and Ugaritic root QṬR (&gt;Ar. miqṭ ara, censer) should be  linked to the Akk. QTR (&gt;Ar. qatara, to exhale and odor).101 Juniper  (Sum. li  gal li  gal-la) was commonly used to purify (along with reed  and tamarisk, both of which grew in Iron I Israel). Smudging by the “chief  purification priest of Eridug” accompanies “cleaning” the temple in  Gudea’s Cylinders A-B account of the building of Ningirsu’s temple  (c.2.1.7, line c217.890). Thus, they play an important role in the mîs-pî  ritual for “enlivening” a new statue of a god.102 Although Dick’s  translation refers to a “censer of juniper,”103 the instructions that call for  “heaped incense” (Sum. na-de3 si ga)104 suggest the “censer” could be  an incense stand or bowl (Akk maksūtu). So-called “censers,” again  incense stands, are kept at the head of beds in private homes, as in the  Neo-Assyrian (and later) Maqlu rituals, asafetida is burned on one by the  bed of the sick person.105 A Neo-Assyrian exorcism ritual describes a  censer for juniper in the same position.106   But large statues are not the only items dedicated by juniper  smudging. Dick’s publication of a Neo-Sumerian text from Nippur CBS  8241 in the University of Pennsylvania Museum provides for  purification/dedication of “seven statuettes” (line 24) with “great juniper”  (line 4), reed, cedar, and myrtle.107 Other items purified by qutāru include  drums and bells.108  As in the Maqlu ritual, cuneiform texts also describe medicinal use  of incense, such as are prescribed for the sick crown prince in ABL 570,  11109 or to treat consuming fever in CT 23, 3 (K.2473+2551, 15).110  There is another possibility with the incense burners, however.  Shamanism always involves altered states of consciousness, and in many  cases these are brought on by psychotropic substances.111 For Native  American groups, these were smoked: high-nicotine forms of tobacco.112   Incense burned in Iron I Israel would not have been frankincense.  It would have included Artemisia judaica (wormwood), Artemisia  arborescens (tree wormwood), Artemisia herba-alba (white wormwood),  Juniperus phoenicea (Phoenician juniper), Liquidambar orientalis (Styrax  balsam113), mastic resin from Pistacia lentiscus,114 Commiphora myrrha  (myrrh),115 Commiphora gileadensis (balm),116 Retama raetam  (broomtree),117 and labdanum resin from Cistus creticus (pink rock- rose).118  Wormwood smudging is a key treatment in Traditional Chinese  Washington Academy of Sciences  </page> <page sequence="9"> 29  Medicine,119 and Egyptian Beduins smudge the leaves to ward off evil  spirits.120 Inhaling its smoke causes significant decreases in heart rate,  which intensify the longer one inhales.121 This is accompanied by  significant changes in the percentage changes in sequential chamber  complexes in the electrocardiogram (ECG).122 The net effect would be a  depressant effect on the body and a stress reduced tendency toward quiet  behavior.123 Anecdotal evidence from the internet of those who have  smoked wormwood denies any hallucinogenic effect, but ascribes to it  “extremely vivid dreams ... otherworldly travel, etc. The vividness that it  causes can also translate into trance and trance-like half-sleep states,  which also helps with channeling.”124 Scientific studies also reported light  euphoria.125 Artemisia herba-alba in particular suppresses arachidonic  acid metabolism,126 which will have major effects on neurons in the  brain.127 The thujones in wormwood inhibit GABA receptor activation so  that neurons fire more easily.128  With juniper, the leaves are used as incense, the anti-bacterial  smoke of which is used even today to repel evil and disease in  Mazandaran Province, Iran.129 Pawnee Skidi Bear Society participants  inhale the smoke from juniper’s burning twigs ceremonially, and it is said  to cure nervousness and nightmares.130 It was also used in Ghost Dance  hand game rituals.131  Styrax balsam smudging was the only repellant for “small winged  snakes” according to Herodotus (Histories 3.107). Styrax balsam or balm  – which is unclear – was praised for its medicinal properties by Galen,  Pliny (Natural History), Celsus (De Medicina), Qusta ibn Luqa, Hayyim  ben Joseph Vital, and Ibn al-Baitar.132 Experimentally, it has been shown  to reduce systemic arterial blood pressure and reduce heart rate.133 It is  usually mixed with labdanum for burning.134   Mastic has been used medicinally since antiquity (Pedanius  Dioscorides, Materia Medica; Hippocrates; Galen).135 It has been  smudged in Iran to purify the air.136 Experimentally, its smoke functions  as a bronchodilator.137   Broomtree smoke contains cytosine, and it has been smoked  recreationally for its reported mild intoxicating properties and a  heightened awareness of color. Its molecular structure has some similarity  to that of nicotine and it has similar pharmacological effects.138  Labdanum resin was used to treat colds, coughs, and rheumatism  (Herodotus, Histories 3.112; Pedanius Dioscorides, Materia Medica  Winter 2014  </page> <page sequence="10"> 30  1.128; Pliny, Natural History, 12.37).139 A perusal of the internet finds  that those who “smoke it” writing, “It totally messes with intellectual  abilities ... It is very very relaxing but not very sedative. In fact it has a  stimulant side to it.” 140  When considering the inventory of Israelite “images,” especially  those found in association with public shrines, no aniconic tendency is  evident, although all statuary is markedly small. Humans, dogs, horses,  bulls, and geese are all represented, with a slight preference for human  females. As small as these figurines are, their affinity is to the shaman’s  “ongons,” among which the wolf and goose are common according to the  Mongolian ethnographic record.141 Archaeologically, human women  figurines are prevalent in Mongolian shaman graves.142 Bird and human  forms are most common in the closely-related Siberian shamanism,  although the wolf or dog is also known.143 In societies with shamans,  “ordinary people as well as shamans carried charms and amulets for  protection against spirits, disease, and misfortune,” including “fabricated  talismans include[ing] small figures carved from wood, ivory, and  stone.”144 In Mongolia, reports of religion of the 12th-13th centuries speak  not only of the shaman’s ongons but also of domestic gods, house-gods.145  Evidence for Totemism  But it should also be noted that Shamanism is a common feature of  totemic societies.146 If the anthropological literature on shamanism is  ambivalent, that on totemism is downright suspect.147 Discussion of  totemism vanished in the 1960s, 70s, and 80s, and by the time biblical  archaeologists discovered anthropology, it was a dead concept. But  beginning in the late 1990s, totemism reappeared in anthropological  literature, most importantly in the work of Philippe Descola.148 New  totemism can be seen as analogous to ethnicity. Ethnicity is now  understood as communal self-definition, a marked opposition between  “we” and “other,” having its genesis in historical forces and becoming  inscribed in culture and the impetus for concrete actions. So, too, totemism  is one historically-specific form of such self-classification, collective  identity embodied symbolically in markers of contrast between different  social groups.149 Totemism, unlike ethnicity, emerges with the  establishment of symmetrical relations between structurally similar social  groups (even when there are short-term inequalities between them).150   Thus, totemic social relations are wholly vertical or hierarchical in nature,  as opposed to a horizontal, egalitarian animism, as Descola maintained.151  The symbolic markers of contrast in totemism are “kinships” or ritual  Washington Academy of Sciences  </page> <page sequence="11"> 31  relationships between humans and animals.152 Since differences between  species are empirically observable, a man who cannot imagine himself to  be like other men notes the sort of animals whose differences from his  fellow animals are homologous with those that distinguish the man from  his fellow men.153 And on occasion non-animals, especially plants,  function similarly.  The Iban of Borneo have manang, who are healers of the body and  spirit, never dangerous sorcerers.154 They are best considered shamans.155  Their business is to combat the spirits that move at night afflicting people,  invisible to ordinary individuals,156 and to retrieve their patients’ “lost  souls” that have strayed away from the body.157 Each Iban shaman has a  unique spirit helper with an animal name, distinct from the totem of  whatever clan the shaman has come from, for Iban shamanism is not  hereditary.158 Moreover, shamanism is not an exclusive vocation in Iban  society.159  Munda of west-central India have similar shamanism; it is an  achieved vocation rather than an inherited ability.160 The Munda, too,  believe in the “stray soul” phenomenon,161 and ― at least among the  Birhor, a hunter-gatherer subgroup of the Munda,162 each shaman also has  his spirit-animal.163  With the Kpelle of Liberia, the Zo medicine men constitute a  distinct sodality. As with the Iban, the Kpelle medicine man can come  from any clan. But he then joins one of the medicine societies, which  functions as a clan of its own.164 No medicine is practiced except by the  medicine societies.165 But the medicine societies also become hereditary  clans. A man becomes a Zo by joining one of the societies, but all male  members of the patrilineal families of Zo members are also Zo.166 The  Kpelle medicine man operates as the Iban does, with spirit helpers and  spirit adversaries.167   Osage medicine men or Wakon’dagi were much more dangerous  and feared, as they could harm their enemies.168 The Sauk (now Sac and  Fox) had both kinds ― the shaman Sisa’ki’euk who with animal-spirit  helpers combatted spirits to heal the sick, and other doctors who could  harm one with magic.169  The practices of these medicine men regularly involve smudging.  For the Birhor, incense was used.170 The Osage smudged with tobacco,171  spotted water hemlock, and staghorn sumac,172 while the Fox used old  field balsam.173   Winter 2014  </page> <page sequence="12"> 32  Masks are likewise an important part of totemism. For the Sepik  River/Murik Lakes people of northern New Guinea, masks, used in  ceremonies,174 are handed down from generation to generation, they have  great power; the mask named Gweim was known to have killed many  people.175 The masks have spirits, which can possess people,176 or can be  communicated with to gain assistance.177 The Kpelle also inherit totemic  masks with ritual functions.178 Masks form one example of “symbolic  property.” Clans and their individuals have perceived kin or ritual  relationships (e.g., protection) to their totems.179 For perceptions of the  past, this might mean the totem had revealed itself to an ancestor of the  clan.180 This may be manifest in descent trees, in personal names, or in  symbolic property held by the clan. For practices of the present,  individuals may observe sacred or aesthetic attitudes to the totem animal.  Masks bridge both categories, as symbolic property employed in present  practices.  Symbolic property is particularly important with Sac and Fox  totemism. Fox sacred bundles are owned collectively by the members of a  clan.181 The cloth-bound bundles are handed down from generation to  generation, and specific ceremonies belong to each bundle.182 Moreover,  the bundles were laden with power even outside of the rituals.183 The  contents of such bundles, indecorously purchased and ripped open by  early 20th-century ethnologists, include small figurines – animal and  anthropomorphic ― along with jewelry, feather, and fabric.184 Sepik and  Birhor symbolic property includes stones or carved objects that are small  enough to be carried around.185  Let me return to the small figurines of early Israel. One horse bust  from Bethel Phase 1 was found in Room 308 along with a bone pendant  with many holes (#1051), a yellow bead (#1070), a carnelian bead  (#1076), and a red stone scarab (#1073; Albright and Kelso 1968:63-65).  The “Astarte Plaque” from Bethel (#104 from Sub6) was found with  carnelian bead (#116 Pittsburgh Theological Seminary #2-0019). These  are not random curios. The nearest source of carnelian was the Nubian  Desert west of Lake Nasser or from Yemen, but most of the carnelian in  antiquity came from western India.186 The jackal from Ai was found inside  the incense burner with a carnelian-and-glass beaded necklace,187 and next  to the burner was the bovine figurine.188 At Tell Dothan, Level 6, in Area  A, the Astarte plaque was found together with a feathered bone wand, a  small copper chain, and a carved lion head.189 Substances like carnelian,  only obtained from journeying to the geographical limits of the known  Washington Academy of Sciences  </page> <page sequence="13"> 33  world or by exchange with peoples who did so, often have the power to  heal or bring fortune in shamanistic societies.190  The small figurines of the Iron I highlands were nearly all found  either in groups or in mini-hordes with other precious objects. Might we  be looking at symbolic property, even sacred bundles?   The flying-man lamp from Dothan is particularly interesting  (Figure 2). It is an imitation of a giant clam. Both Maxima Clam  (Tridacna maxima) and Fluted Giant Clam (Tridacna squamosa) are  found in the Red Sea. There are no similar species in the Mediterranean.  Regardless of whether the inhabitants of Dothan knew where the shell was  really found, they had attempted to invoke a far distant land, even a  “World Rim,” commonly the place where supernatural entities reside. The  lamp design itself would have been a statement of shamanic power given  that it was modeled after a creature found far outside the boundaries of the  Israelite world.191       Figure 2. Flying-man lamp imitates a giant clam.   But this is not just a clam shell, it is a flying man (Figure 3). The  man is somewhat hidden until the lamp is manipulated in just the right  way.192 If the lamp’s underside itself is meant to suggest wings attached to  Winter 2014  </page> <page sequence="14"> 34  the man’s arms, then it is a hybrid creature similar to those of the  shamanic Hopewell.193 The being is flying, like the bird costumes worn by  Siberian shamans to travel to the sky world.194       Figure 3. Flying-man lamp from Dothan.   Finally, let us turn back to the sacred spaces of early Israel. Recall  the sort of “kiva” at Ai and the larger temple at Tirzah. The Mount Ebal  altar is oriented to the compass points. Such cardinal orientation serves to  anchor the quadrants of the world whose origin is in the human body and  perception, using the sun as a reference point.195 “Orthogonal pairs of  points establish a quadripartite universe, with north-south and east-west  Washington Academy of Sciences  </page> <page sequence="15"> 35  situated at right angles to each other. In this system, the east-west line of  the sun’s rising and setting at the equinoxes is crossed by an orthogonal  north-south line, thereby forming a cross ― often used as a symbol for the  world’s four quarters.”196The large plaza around the altar, then, could have  been used like Woodland earthworks for world renewal ceremonies.197  The catalogue of mortuary evidence from the Iron I highland  settlement is meager. Sufficient excavation has taken place now to say that  it is too meager, and that graves should have been found.198 The main  disposal method was simple inhumation outside of settlements. Elizabeth  Bloch-Smith disputes this conclusion because no simple inhumation  burials have ever been found in the Iron I countryside, but the statistical  unlikelihood of coming across such skeletal remains unassociated with  architecture is huge.199   For simple inhumation of single individuals away from  settlements, there is one main ethnographic analogy, and it is ancient  Mongolia, the quintessential home of shamanism.200 Written documents  from the early historical period attest to funerary practices of leaving  bodies exposed or in trees, followed by simple inhumation or leaving the  bones in situ.201 Archaeological investigation has found simple  inhumation to be “the prevalent funerary practice during the Genghis  Khan period in Mongolia.”202 Shamans were especially noted for their  isolated, hidden tombs, since their tombs were feared and to be avoided203  ― if they were buried at all: many deceased Mongol shamans were simply  left in the forest to decompose.204  The few tombs of the central highlands fall into two groups:  pottery-only graves and others. Tell en-Nasbeh Tomb 29, Jelamet `Amer,  Taiyiba, and Tell Dothan’s Khirbet en-Namleh cemetery all have nothing  but pottery. Tell en-Nasbeh Tomb 54, Khirbet Nisya Tomb 65, Tell  Dothan Tomb 1, Level 1, and Tomb 3 have many additional types of grave  goods. There is nearly a double correlation of this division with tomb  location: while some of the pottery-only tombs are located in major cities,  the graves with multiple types of goods all are attached to sites. This  dichotomy between pottery-only tombs, isolated or urban, and city graves  with higher numbers of artifact types (“NAT”) could have any number of  reasons ― cultural or social. We cannot suggest that the elites were buried  in the towns and the poor in the country, given the Cypriote Black-on-Red  ware from the isolated pottery-only grave at Taiyiba, and Tell en-Nasbeh’s  pottery-only Tomb 29 beside NAT=8 Tomb 54. Tombs from Gibeon and  Tell el-Farah North also seem to be pottery-only.205  Winter 2014  </page> <page sequence="16"> 36  Keeping in mind that burial sites are in essence liminal areas,  selection of grave goods required intimate knowledge of the symbolism of  the goods and their preferred placement.206 Tell en-Nasbeh tomb 54  contained two large bronze bracelets (still on the arms of the deceased),  twenty-five iron rings, two iron arrowheads, nine eyelet pins, two crude  stamp seals, one with two arms and two legs and the other of a horned  animal with three legs (#M2650),207 one cylinder seal 20mm long, 13m  diameter, with bearded men facing left with raised arms (#M2647, object  registry #35.3138; photo #1498),208 as well as a large assortment of  dishware and cookware.209 Khirbet Nisya tomb 65 contained over fifty  carnelian beads, cut cowry shells (Cypraea),210 two pendants in the shape  of Egyptian white lotus seed pods,211 two elongated stone pendants made  of limestone plated with metal, six bronze rings, one iron ring, twelve  bronze bracelets, nine iron (carbon steel) bracelets from a Transjordanian  source, two Hyksos scarabs, a half-dozen bronze toggle pins, a cone- shaped seal with a man with his arms up and two squiggles at his sides,  and assorted basalt and ivory objects ― altogether, fifty metal items for  fifty people. Thus, we again see carnelian and other imported luxury items  obtained from journeying to the geographical limits of the known world or  by exchange with peoples who did so, often having the power to heal or  bring fortune in shamanistic societies.212  Conclusions  We have examined the archaeology of religion for 12th-11th- century BCE Israel in the light of ethnographic analogy. The religion of  this earliest Israelite community, according to the archaeology,  corresponds closely to the praxes integral to shamanism all over the world.  Shamanism must have been widespread not only in popular “folk  religion,” but also among an elite whose material produce was of material  durable enough for artifacts to attesting to its beliefs.   The case for totemism is modest, but plausible. Further research  will be required in order to establish the extent to which totemic social  relations predominated in Early Iron Age Israel, but these initial  observations are suggestive that they did.     1 E.g., M.

The goddess Astarte is the most likely candidate for the goddess  depicted on the Late Bronze Age terra-cotta plaques that are popular in the southern  Levant before the rise of the Judean pillar figurines in Judah (see P. Moorey, Idols of the  People: Miniature Images of Clay in the Ancient Near East [Oxford University Press,  2004]). Some scholars have expressed doubts that the plaque figurines represent a  goddess, as they lack divine attributes. They are found mostly in domestic contexts, some  in graves. While it is true that not all representations of naked women need necessarily  depict goddesses, it is also the case that goddesses need not be represented with divine  attributes. The nude female figures on models of shrines or temples, usually in pairs,  sometimes three, or on clay towers and cultic stands from both Syria and Palestine, lack  Washington Academy of Sciences  </page> <page sequence="21"> 41    divine attributes, but are clearly divine figures. Occasionally they are standing on lions, a  symbol of Astarte (as in the horse frontlets). This does not make the figure on the plaque  figurines, or the Judean pillar figurines, necessarily representative of deities, but it does  remove the only real argument that they were not goddesses. See Shawna Dolansky, “Re- Figuring Judean “Fertility” Figurines: Fetishistic Functions of the Feminine Form,” in  Israelite Religion and Old Testament Theology, ed. R. D. Miller II, forthcoming.  58 Menaham Haran (“‘Incense Altars’ – Are They?” in Biblical Archaeology Today 1990  [Jerusalem: Israel Exploration Society, 1993), 237-47; “Altar-ed States: Incense Theory  Goes Up in Smoke,” BRev 11.1 [Feb 1995]: 30-37, 48) argues that these were not incense  altars but altars for small-scale vegetable offerings, but the comparative ancient Near  Eastern evidence, cited below, does not support Haran’s view. Seymour Gitin’s (“The  Four-Horned Altar and Sacred Space,” in Sacred Time, Sacred Place, ed. B. M.

A definition of shamanism is rather elusive. Yet the term  allows the “rendering, as faithfully and subtly as possible, into a lingua franca of  scholarly discourse, where analytical terms are employed which on the one hand are  arguably applicable to the case under study, but which at the same time have a wider  range of applicability, involving other cultures, other settings in time and space”; Wim  Van Binsbergen and Frans Wiggermann, “Magic in History,” expanded version of  “Magic in History” in Mesopotamian Magic, ed. T. Abusch and K. van der Toorn  (Groningen: Styx, 1999), at http://www.shikanda.net/ancient_models/gen3/magic.htm.  Roughly, shamanism is a complex of beliefs and practices based in the idea that spirits  pervade the universe and that these spirits can be deliberately contacted for specific  purposes by specific persons through altered states of consciousness.

Deer Shamanism often  accompanies Bear Shamanism; Romain, Shamans, 39-42. There is bear shamanism in  Neolithic Anatolia; Ali Umut Türkcan, “Is it a goddess or a bear?” Documenta  Praehistorica 34 (2007): 260. No bear bones have been found in Iron I Israel. But in the  Late Bronze Age, there exist seventeen bear bones from Lachish (LB II-III), and there are  a few Iron II examples each from Tel Dan (9th/8th century), Hazor (1 bone, 9th century),  and Tel Qiri. We should be surprised to see that there are seventeen bear bones from LB  Lachish, plus two additional undated specimens. Wild animals of any sort are relatively  rare on post-Neolithic sites in the Near East, and carnivores other than dogs are even  rarer. Hunting was uncommon and carnivore populations were never high. Because of the  skeletal elements present in the Lachish examples and the cut marks on them, they most  likely came with bear skins and thus may have been traded in that form from wherever  the animals were killed. The biblical text describes Elijah, an erstwhile shaman (see R. D.  Miller, “Shamanism in Early Israel,” Wiener Zeitschrift für die Kunde des Morgenlandes  101 (2011): 335-37) as a “Lord of Hair,” רָעֵשׂ לַעַבּ, not wearing a garment of haircloth but  perhaps a bearskin, or himself hairy as a bear.

Pedersen,  “Totemism, Animism, and North Asian Indigenous Ontologies,” Journal of the Royal  Anthropological Institute 7 (2001): 418-19.  147 The origin of the term, drawn from Ojibwa (Although the Ojibwa are not a good  example of totemism; Christopher Vecsey, Traditional Ojibwa Religion [Philadelphia:  American Philosophical Society, 1983], 78) was an 1869 study by the Scottish  ethnologist, John Ferguson McLennan, “The Worship of Plants and Animals.” McLennan  proposed that “Men first worshipped plants; next the heavenly bodies, supposed to be  animals”; John Ferguson McLennan, “Worship of Plants and Animals,” Fortnightly  Review 6-7 (1869-70): 407. Drawing his evidence from American Indians and Australian  Aborigines, he described the relationship of a man and his totem, which was his  protector, kindred within a system of matrilineal exogamy, and taboo as food. Totemism  survived into the rise of scientific anthropological archaeology and the Kulturgeschichte  thinkers of the 1920s, beginning with Clark Wissler and continuing through James  Griffin in the 1950s. A culture was a list of traits, and one such list could be totemism;  Pedersen, “Totemism,” 417. Bronislaw Malinowski (Magic, Science and Religion and  Other Essays [Glencoe, Illinois: The Free Press, 1948], 44-47) upheld the importance of  dietary taboos corresponding to the totem of a clan, derived from the perceived kinship  between clan and totem. The death of totemism in anthropology came from Lévi-Strauss  Washington Academy of Sciences  </page> <page sequence="27"> 47    in 1963. Lévi-Strauss argued that the term encompassed at least four distinct structural  perceptions of societies, which could not be lumped under a single category. Contrary to  the “myth” of totemism, the thought of such societies rests upon a rich and complex  conceptual structure. The entire concept of totemism was an artifact of Western thinking  imposed by anthropology, a projection of Christian separation of man and nature on  societies whose thought patterns still functioned in a mythic, timeless mode.   148 Rane Willerslev and Olga Ulturgasheva, “Revisiting the Animism versus Totemism  Debate,” in Animism in Rainforest and Tundra, ed.
