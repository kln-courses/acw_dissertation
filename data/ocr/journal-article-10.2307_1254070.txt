<plain_text><page sequence="1">DE GRAECORUM DIIS NON REFERENTIBUS SPECIEM HUMANUM. Marinus Willem de Visser. Lugduni-Batavorum, G. Los, I900. THE extent to which scientific anthropology has penetrated classical studies, and is helping to revolutionise and reconstitute our knowledge of pagan alntiquity, is illustrated by Dr. de Visser's thesis for his degree at the university of Leyden. The body of the work is a collection from classical and post-classical writers, and from coins and inscriptions of all kinds, of references to Greek superstitions concerning plants, animals, stocks, and stones directly or indirectly indicative of the worship of divinities having other than human forms. This collection is preceded and followed by an interesting introduction and comments. Ap- proving Schultze's definition of fetishism, which extends not merely to the worship of terrestrial objects like rocks, trees, animals, mountains, seas, and rivers, but also of the sun, moon, stars, and clouds, Dr. De Visser goes on to discuss totemism. The explanation of totemism which he accepts is that of Wilken, namely, that particular species of animals and plants are venerated because it is believed that the souls of departed clansmen have passed into them. This theory, whether true or not, has the advantage of yielding an intelligible connection between totemism and the cult of the dead. The author favours the opinion that many Greek superstitions are ultimately referable to totemism. R2</page><page sequence="2">244 Reviews. Discussing the questions why many deities have incongruous attributes, and why several kinds of animals or plants are often under the tutelage of one and the same deity, he contends that there is no difference of kind between the higher gods and the lower orders of spiritual beings, and suggests that a definite deity of a lofty personality has in these cases taken the place of an anonymous demon, or that the latter has become absorbed by the new and higher divinity. This theory of conflation, as it may be called, has been heard of before. The process is, indeed, well known to have gone on in connection with the conversion of the barbarians to Christianity, and its results are visible in the folklore of all Europe. Yet I am not sure that it has received enough consideration at the hands of anthropological students for the purpose of explaining the characteristics of the classical gods. Dr. De Visser regards animism as the savage philosophy of religion; and in discussing the various causes of reverence for animals, trees, stocks, and stones he refers them all in the last resort to animism. Now the degree of accuracy with which this theory represents the facts very much depends on the definition of animism. It must at least be made to include that presumably earlier habit of regarding all external objects as endowed with personality and consciousness similar to human, without raising questions as to a soul. But this is a larger range of meaning than Dr. De Visser gives it. He even makes fetishism dependent on animism, since he holds it to be the worship of an object because it is the abode of a spirit (quia animi domus est). His discussion of the steps by which anthropomorphism con- quered is very interesting. He is undoubtedly right in his conten- tion against B6tticher that the worship of stocks (?O'ava) is only due in part to their being relics of trees. Idolatry, he thinks, arises from the union of fetishism (as above defined) with anthro- pomorphism. In the final chapter he turns to answer the question why are there more traces of the worship of stones, stocks, trees, and animals in Greece after the Christian era than before. It is curious at first sight that both the later monuments and the later literary sources are more productive of evidence than the earlier. Dr. De Visser accounts for this phenomenon by a general reaction against anthropomorphism. Anthropomorphism, which began by raising the divine ideal to a height of majesty and beauty hitherto unattained, ended by degrading the gods to the condition of mere</page><page sequence="3">Reviews. 245 humanity. Aphrodite lost all sublimity when she lasciviously displayed her charms to every eye. Apollo was shorn of dignity and glory when he became, in marble or in bronze, a mere youth playing with a lizard. The consequent reaction was reinforced by the superstitions of all kinds that spread through the Roman empire on the break-up of the ancient local and tribal faiths, and in the universal ferment that preceded and accompanied the advent of Christianity. This subject, however, is beyond the scope of Dr. De Visser's thesis, and he does no more than indicate the solution of the problem. Dr. De Visser's book, as this sketch will show, is a valuable con- tribution to anthropology. His collection of texts will be very useful to students. And the accompanying commentary, though it may not approve itself in all details, is the work of one who is thoroughly versed in the literature of his subject, and has carefully weighed the various theories between which he has had to choose. English anthropologists share with Wilken and Marillier the fore- most places among his authorities. E. SIDNEY HARTLAND.</page></plain_text>
