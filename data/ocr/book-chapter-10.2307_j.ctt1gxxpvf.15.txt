<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 9 Picturing cruelty: chicken advocacy and visual culture cPricuteultrying Annie Potts and Philip Armstrong In December 2004, scientists announced they had cracked the first complete genetic code of a bird: over 20,000 genes had been found to comprise the genome sequence of the Red Jungle Fowl, the wild pro- genitor of all chickens. Immediately there was speculation about how the mapping of the chicken genome could benefit humankind; it was claimed that manipulation of embryonic growth with the assistance of new knowledge about the chicken genome would lead to advances in dealing with human developmental diseases such as cleft palate and muscular dystrophy, as well as DNA changes associated with human ageing. ‘The chicken is really in an evolutionary sweet spot’, stated Richard Wilson, director of the international team that mapped the genome. ‘It’s at just the right evolutionary distance from all the other genomes we already have to provide us with a great deal of fresh in- sight into the human genome’ (Wilson, cited in Purdy 2004). It was also announced that understanding the genetic code of chickens would greatly advantage those in agribusiness: one of the researchers enthusi- astically declared that this new information about chickens would act as a ‘ “bible” for those who seek to breed [even] faster-growing birds, lower-fat breasts and more prolific egg-layers’ (Mestel 2004). While the A Potts &amp; P Armstrong (2013). Picturing cruelty: chicken advocacy and visual culture. In J Johnston &amp; F Probyn-Rapsey (Eds). Animal death. Sydney: Sydney University Press. 151 </page> <page sequence="2"> Animal death scientific community applauded the discovery of the chicken genome, chicken advocates lamented the exposure of these birds to further sci- entific experimentation and commercial exploitation. For, while the blueprint of the Jungle Fowls’ genome may offer insights into gallin- aceous origins, and open a new window on the ancient history of life on this planet, its discovery also undoubtedly seals chickenkind’s con- tinued manipulation and abuse as a ‘utility object’ in human hands. To give some idea of the extent of chicken exploitation today: it is estimated that worldwide over 50 billion chickens are killed for meat each year. America kills around 23 million broiler or meat chicks per day, around 10 billion per year; while in the United Kingdom 860 million broiler chicks and 30 million ‘end-of-lay’ hens are killed an- nually. Australia kills at least 500 million broiler chicks each year for meat, having raised 96% in intensive systems, while 11 million bat- tery hens produce 93% of the nation’s eggs (Potts 2012). Australians refer to the modern poultry industry as ‘technology’s child’, because the changes in the use of machinery and technology undertaken by com- mercial chicken farmers within the past century have been dramatic and immense (Dixon 2002, 83). Such changes included the invention of incubators and brooders (which separated mother hens from eggs and hatched chicks), and the creation of highly mechanised barn and cage systems that permitted intensive automated farming of chickens for both meat and eggs. Technical ‘advances’ in slaughterhouses, along with modifications to the ways in which meat from chickens was pack- aged and marketed, also allowed increasing numbers of birds to be ‘processed’ at a time. Modern poultry farming rapidly transformed chickens, who over many centuries and cultures had been revered for their beauty, bravery and devotion to parenthood, into the least respected and most ex- ploited creatures on the planet (Potts 2012).1 The word ‘chicken’ has now come to symbolise cowardice, and the hen, whose love for her chicks was once so admired, has become a dispensable egg-making ma- chine. Instead of a natural lifespan of up to 12 years, the typical farmed chick today will live about four to six weeks, never having experienced sunshine, rain or grass, and will arrive at the slaughterhouse still ut- tering the cheeping sounds and coated with the premature down of chicks. Most consumers of chicken meat do not realize they are eat- ing juvenile birds (a fact not widely publicised by the poultry industry); 152 </page> <page sequence="3"> 9 Picturing cruelty perhaps some would still not care much if they did know this fact, for in modern societies chickens have become de-natured, de-personalised and even de-animalised. This latter point is evident in the nonchalant ways Western consumers approach chicken meat. An important tech- nique for disguising the origins of meat (and reducing the likelihood of consumers feeling disconcerted about eating once living creatures) is to remove skin, feathers and bones; this process, referred to by Kub- berod (2005) as ‘de-animalisation’, also applies to offal and organs. In addition, the meat from an animal is often given another name from the creature it is derived from; for example, pig becomes pork or ham, and cow becomes beef. However, in poultry industry studies chicken meat is rarely classified by consumers as potentially or borderline re- pulsive because chickens, as a result of industrialisation, are no longer considered significant sentient beings to start with. They are ‘chicken’ before and when they are eaten; consumers comfortably consider them as food even while they are alive. It is also commonplace in Western culture to ridicule the deaths of chickens for food production. Hence American Dick Clark’s cartoon strip once featured the ‘joke’: ‘Where did Paul Simon get the idea to write “Mother and Child Reunion”? From a chicken-and-egg dish at a 1 While chickens are exploited primarily for food, they are also utilised in myriad other ways. For example, the chicken provides the most popular ‘farm animal model’ in studies of arthritis, cardiovascular disease, cystic fibrosis, skin disorders, eye diseases, muscular dystrophy, viral infections such as HIV, and vaccine testing (Fox 1997, 88). Vivisection on chickens has also involved growing tooth buds in the jaws of newly hatched chicks (chickens do not have teeth in nature), developing facial abnormalities (such as two beaks), transplanting brain tissue from quails into chicks (to ascertain whether chicks will then prefer a mother quails’ calls). Pain research on chicks has included confining 1–14-day-old Leghorns to hot plates to determine whether older or younger chicks jump faster when exposed to more heat (Hughes 1990; Hughes &amp; Sufka 1990). Agricultural experiments focus on improving the economical benefits of poultry farming. Scientists have shaved hens (in studies on heat stress), cut off the wings and legs of newly hatched chicks to establish how much growers could save in food costs if they had to feed smaller broiler chicks, and created featherless birds for intensive farming in hot climates. The poultry industry also supplies fertilised eggs to schools in order that children may follow the hatching and development of chicks as part of their education (chicks are commonly discarded following this exercise). Chickens are also used by the US military to detect chemicals in Iraq; the birds, who travel on army vehicles, succumb if exposed to deadly toxins (Davis 2003). 153 </page> <page sequence="4"> Animal death Chinese restaurant’ (Adams 2003, 150);2 while The Christchurch Press, the daily newspaper of the city where we live, recently featured a piece on the fun of barbecuing by a regular columnist who joked that ‘whole chickens (deceased) cook beautifully on the barbecue when you insert a full can of beer up their rear ends and stand them to attention in a row over the grill’ (Bramwell 2006, 23). The conjoining in contemporary culture of chickens’ principal role as merely ‘food’ with a total disreg- ard for their sentience is also starkly evident in a recent advertising campaign named Subservient Chicken run by Burger King to promote the company’s range of chicken meat sandwiches. Subservient Chicken centred on a website featuring a person dressed in a cartoon chicken costume; users commanded the chicken to perform over 300 pre-re- corded activities, such as ‘Riverdance’, ‘Lay Egg’, ‘Yoga’, and ‘Spank’. The chicken obeys when an instruction is typed over Burger King’s cam- paign slogan ‘Get chicken just the way you like it’. Subservient Chicken attracted 20 million hits within one week, and won gold at the 2005 Viral Awards granted to successful advertising campaigns (Anderson 2009). Jokes about the subservience of chickens extend to the arena of pranks: in ‘chicken roping’ contests in the United States, girls and boys compete to see who can lasso and rope a chicken’s feet quickest once birds are lowered into a rodeo ring; the chickens at these events are also whipped by small ropes and submitted to various forms of suspension ‘for fun’. These activities testify to the levels to which chickens have sunk in the worlds of symbolism and the human imagination: dim-witted comic chickens are made to spank themselves, actual dead chickens have cans of beer stuffed up them to make them explode, and live chick- ens are pursued around a rodeo ring by children learning to have fun by exercising cruelty towards, and domination over, terrified birds. These examples demonstrate the need for public education as well as sanctu- ary for chickens in contemporary Western societies. Chicken activism 2 This story is actually provided as one of the possible meanings ‘behind the lyrics’ of Simon’s song; and it may certainly be the case that an omelette presented to Simon at a restaurant in New York’s Chinatown sparked his thinking about separation between mothers and offspring; however, most analysts of the lyrics to ‘Mother and child reunion’ speculate Simon approached this subject with more seriousness and sensitivity than traditional ‘hen and egg’ jokes afford. 154 </page> <page sequence="5"> 9 Picturing cruelty works to challenge ignorant ideas about and disrespectful treatment of Gallus gallus, to promote compassion for these most abused of birds, and to resurrect accurate understanding of chickens as sentient and in- telligent creatures. What follows is an historical overview of some of the ways in which chicken activism over the past 50 years or so has util- ised visual culture, especially provocative imagery, to raise awareness, educate the public, politicise and lobby against the miserable lives and deaths of the majority of the planet’s chickens. In particular we focus on the beginnings of modern ‘imagery’ activism in the work of the British group Chickens’ Lib, the rise of the open rescue movement, the im- portant place of internet activism, and the works of artists campaigning against the exploitation of chickens. Chickens’ Lib The modern-day use of eye-catching visuals to challenge the treatment of chickens in Western societies emerged in a serious way in the early 1970s when a group of outraged women protested on the steps of Whitehall Place in London, before the premises of the Ministry of Agri- culture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF).3 A few days earlier, one of these women had talked her way into obtaining a couple of ‘spent’ battery hens destined for slaughter and consumption in the East End. These hens were also present at the protest. Contained in a makeshift ‘sample’ battery cage built by the woman’s husband, they provided visual test- ament to the condition of hens farmed intensively for their eggs throughout the United Kingdom. This brazen action, occurring at a time when the second-wave women’s movement was on the rise, helped to launch the public face of another newly formed activist group, Chickens’ Lib. Led for many years by independent poultry welfare re- searcher Clare Druce, and her mother Violet Spalding, Chickens’ Lib was the first organisation to dedicate its activities primarily towards raising awareness of intensive chicken farming practices. For decades, Chickens’ Lib confronted consumers with the truth behind the eggs 3 Philip Armstrong (2007) points out how even earlier protests, such as the Old Brown Dog demonstration in London in 1905, appealed to visibility (in this case, of the human protestors rather than actual animals). 155 </page> <page sequence="6"> Animal death they ate each morning and the meat they bought for dinner, and lob- bied government and agribusiness to change the living and slaughter conditions of farmed chickens in Britain. The appearance over 30 years ago of the rescued battery hens on the steps of MAFF in London provided the urban public with perhaps their first glimpse of the ‘real lives’ of hens confined in cages. This tac- tic, instigated by Druce as a provocative, effective way to draw attention to ‘the hens behind the eggs’, remains crucial in contemporary animal activism, and especially in exposés of intensively farmed animals. From very small beginnings – in fact, just Druce and a handful of supporters with the determination to show the misery of factory farmed chickens to the world – this group grew to impact hugely on the British scene and also influence North American activism.4 One British chronicle even wrote in 1979 that the names Violet Spalding and Clare Druce might mean nothing to most people, but in the corridors of Whitehall they are names that can cause shudders of fear . . . known to halt a whole morning’s work at the Ministry of Agriculture, they have demonstrated in Whitehall addressing ministry officials by loud- speaker, appeared on television in their own programme [and] been threatened with prosecution by the police . . . Chickens’ Lib may sound like a joke but it isn’t. (Druce, personal communication, 2010) The legacy of Chickens’ Lib continues today in the various ways that advocacy for chickens relies on visual impact to raise awareness and gain public support. The employment of pictures in animal activism per se has been considered important not least because of the notion that animals are unable to speak for or represent themselves; thus compas- sionate people attempt to represent on their behalf (Burt 2002). Images work especially well for issues relating to companion animals and wild animals, particularly those considered charismatic, such as the great apes, big cats and cetaceans. According to James Jasper, this is because such ‘categories’ of animals provide powerful ‘condensing symbols’ that 4 Karen Davis, head of the world’s foremost advocacy group for poultry (United Poultry Concerns) credits Druce with having led the way for today’s campaigners against cruelty towards chickens (personal communication, 7 August 2008). 156 </page> <page sequence="7"> 9 Picturing cruelty aid political or ethical protests because they appeal to a variety of viewers and address issues and concerns deemed acceptable for public debate (Jasper 1997). Managing visual impact is more complex when dealing with chicken exploitation as these birds are not readily viewed as charismatic or in any way ‘special’ by the general population (as pre- viously mentioned, they are more likely to be seen as trivial, stupid, dispensable – ‘meat’ even before death). Nor are chickens likely to elicit in viewers a ‘cute response’ – that is, an emotional nurturing response triggered by ‘infant’ animals like fluffy kittens or playful puppies (Gen- osko 2005). In popular culture chickens tend to be anthropomorphised as dim-witted and silly characters, or they appear as cute yellow chicks with no clear relation to the grim realities of chicken adulthood. In meat or egg advertising chickens seem ridiculously jovial; readers will be familiar with signage showing happy caricatured chickens pointing to eateries selling chicken meat, as if these birds are personally de- lighted to be on the menu. Over 30 years ago cultural theorist John Berger argued convincingly that ‘real’ animals had largely vanished in Western culture, having been replaced with other animal images, such as those we see now in cartoons, movies, and marketing. This pheno- menon, he contended, worked to divorce humans from more authentic and respectful relationships with actual animals, to replace the animal as animal with the animal as spectacle (Berger 1980). We suggest that while Berger’s position is still valid in many ways, it has also been (help- fully) complicated by newer theory on the place of animals in visual culture (Baker 1993; Burt 2002; Armstrong 2007; Malamud 2010). Re- cent thinking on animal representation informs analysis of chicken advocacy presented below. Show and tell in chicken activism Effective political campaigns against poultry farming and other forms of chicken exploitation have, since Chickens’ Lib, relied heavily on visual exposure, particularly spectacular footage. Activism disrupts the concealment of experimental or intensively farmed chickens which routinely occurs in the domains of technoscience and agriculture. As urban-centred commodity capitalism has developed over the last two centuries, it has increasingly demanded that images of animal suffering 157 </page> <page sequence="8"> Animal death be removed from public view; thus meat producers attempt to conceal the origins of the billions of McNuggetsTM and KFC Wicked WingsTM con- sumed each year, whereas those protesting the immense exploitation of chickenkind expose these unpalatable facts about the poultry industry and mass chicken meat consumption. Consequently, the struggle between these two sides of the animal-use debate have often been played out in the arena of visual culture, and have involved attempts to regulate or liberate the power of the seen and the unseen. One highly successful strategy employed by activists has involved using raw footage of actual animals in order to reveal the avian suffer- ing and pain ‘behind the scenes’. For instance, Kentucky Fried Cruelty, a campaign run by the American-based organisation People for the Eth- ical Treatment of Animals (PETA), strives to expose the misery behind the chicken meat sold at thousands of KFC outlets worldwide. To this end, Kentucky Fried Cruelty’s webpage shows ‘undercover investiga- tions’ of abuse towards chickens filmed on named farms and slaughter- houses across America, as well as India, Germany, Australia, New Zea- land and the United Kingdom. In 2004, Kentucky Fried Cruelty was responsible for bringing into the public arena material secretly filmed within a Maryland slaughterhouse owned by Perdue Farms Incorpor- ated, one of KFC’s main suppliers of chicken meat in the United States. In the film, live chicks at the plant are kicked and thrown by employees, and are still conscious when their bodies enter the scalding tanks. Such real-time footage draws the public eye to precisely those realities that are usually eclipsed from the consumer’s view: namely, the stages of the industrial processing sequence that turn animals into meat. Open rescue While protest demonstrations involving live hens still occur, such as those conducted by the women from Chickens’ Lib during the organ- isation’s formative days, these can now reach far beyond local media or the eyes of those in the immediate vicinity. The internet is now the most significant resource for animal activism; rapidly reaching mil- lions around the globe, its contribution to global educative activism is immense. Publicising scenes such as those at the Perdue plant may in- volve secretly filmed footage by undercover groups, streamed live or 158 </page> <page sequence="9"> 9 Picturing cruelty later released online. Clandestine operations were until the 1990s com- monplace among those identifying as animal liberationists; however, more recently, the public exposure of conditions within battery farms is the result of footage obtained during ‘open rescues’, which, as the name implies, involve the very visible release and care of incarcerated and mistreated chickens. Open rescues are conducted by teams of in- dividuals who are identifiable at all times; the human faces of rescuers are not hidden, nor are their names necessarily concealed. The moral premise underlying open rescues is that ‘it is wrong to knowingly let any individual, regardless of their species, die an unnecessarily slow, agonizing and painful death’, and rescue workers are required to act as professionally and carefully as ‘colleagues in other rescue areas such as fire fighters, state emergency services or ambulance personnel’ (see www.openrescue.org). Property is not vandalised or destroyed; only non-violent methods of emancipation are employed. OpenRescue.org states the immediate objective of documented rescues carried out in factory farms is to liberate individual chickens who are suffering, but the confrontational visual coverage accompany- ing such daring emancipations also helps capture public attention and highlight issues related to intensive farming and slaughter practices. If rescuers are caught and charged with trespass or theft, this can work to their advantage as trials are opportunities to broadcast stories about conditions on chicken farms to the unknowing public. Open rescue is now a worldwide phenomenon with teams operating in Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic, Scandinavia, North America, Australia and New Zealand (Jones 2006). The pioneer of the global open rescue movement, Australian Patty Mark, led the first open rescue fronted by Animal Liberation Victoria in 1992. Mark’s approach is staunch: as well as challenging the cruelty inherent in intensive poultry farming (a sub- ject that more readily attracts the sympathy of the public), she ensures open rescues reveal the fallacies behind free-range chicken meat and eggs, reasoning that ‘it is poor use of our time to engage with animal industries, big business and governments trying to encourage them to treat the animals who are at their mercy “better”. The real work isn’t negotiating with the animal industries, but with educating the public’ (Mark 2006). In terms of effectiveness, visual campaigns against battery farming have an advantage over broiler chick campaigns. Activism on behalf of 159 </page> <page sequence="10"> Animal death layer hens is more readily amenable to visual representation, because ‘a snapshot of three or four featherless hens in a cramped cage’ provides the kind of potent ‘condensing symbol’ identified by Jasper; such an im- age immediately embodies the key elements of the case against battery farming: that extreme confinement and sensory deprivation cannot but degrade the birds’ physical and behavioural wellbeing. The plight of chicks raised for meat is not so easily explained through pictures of broiler sheds as these juvenile birds retain their feathers, are not kept in cages, and, because they appear plump, may even be labelled ‘greedy’ (Franklin 1999). However, savvy activism exploits these very features of broiler chicks in order to educate the public about those ‘uncom- fortable’ issues cleverly disguised by the chicken meat industry, such as the fact that broiler chicks are still technically ‘babies’ when slaughtered and eaten; that they suffer from painful conditions brought on by se- lective breeding for rapid massive weight gain; and that they may be unable to stand for days, even weeks, before their lives are ended. In- stead of using a snapshot image of broiler chicks in a shed, the fate of broilers can be visually demonstrated by juxtaposing a ‘meat chick’ at one and six weeks of age with another breed of chicken at the same stages of life, a strategy used by New Zealand animal advocacy group Save Animals From Exploitation. Because the suffering of chickens in the commercial meat industry is less easily condensed into a potent image, another important strategy in advocacy for these birds involves asking people to imagine being broiler chicks. This approach was used by Pulitzer-Prize winning au- thor Alice Walker in a letter she wrote on Mother’s Day 2004 addressed to David Novak, then CEO of Yum! Brands, the parent company of KFC (see Walker’s letter below).5 While the once-hidden living (and dy- 5 ‘Suppose in a future life you come back as a chicken. You are small and fuzzy and scared. You feel heavy and hot, suffocating because you are constantly drugged; your body forced to grow so large and fast your bones cannot support it: they begin to break . . . Your body, broken though it is, and smeared with excrement that left it because you were so afraid as you died, is plucked of its sickly covering of feathers, cut up, and sent to the place where it will be covered with white flower and herbs, fried in hot fat, and presented to human families who have no way of knowing they are eating – bringing into their own bodies (and spirits) – the deep suffering, fear and misery of your largely unlived life’. (Walker 2004) 160 </page> <page sequence="11"> 9 Picturing cruelty ing) conditions of intensively farmed chickens are now increasingly in evidence – thanks to the world wide web and open rescues – people still have to be motivated to investigate and educate themselves. To this end, the participation of celebrities such as Walker in public protests assists to attract a wider audience. Thus, organisations such as PETA enlist popular culture icons to front particular campaigns; for example, celebrities as diverse as Oprah Winfrey, Pamela Anderson, P!nk, Sir Paul McCartney, the Dalai Lama, Ryan Gosling and Emmylou Harris are all enlisted as speakers against KFC. Activist art Historically, the production of artworks has been integral to some of the most exploitative connections humans have had with animals (such as farming and hunting) (Burt 2008); it has also been important as a vehicle for protest against such practices. Most well-known artworks involving chickens tend to contain familiar renditions of these birds, portrayals which are more or less easily recognised within certain cul- tural contexts and commonly shared ideas about ‘chicken-ness’ and what chickens represent. For example, chickens may portray the rural (American folk art), pastoral (European art), or stand for characterist- ics of pride and strength (Japanese folk art). The chickens in such works are more or less conventional depictions of what a culture (and artist) assumes about chickens; in the Western context traditional art tends to objectify chickens in accordance with cultural assumptions about the gallus gallus domesticus species (Potts 2012). However, art also exists in which the image and/or idea of the chicken evokes a sense of the unfa- miliar, aiming to challenge the viewer. Such works disrupt conventional use of chickens in art by associating chicken motifs with other, often less sanguine, versions of chickens’ lives or appearances; or by using chickens as metaphorical or subliminal media for human concerns. Jonathan Burt (2008, 5) argues that art since the 1960s – especially performance and environmental art – has ‘transformed the animal from art object to living artwork so the borderline between the animal and the aesthetic became much more evidently permeable’; this trend, he suggests, should be understood ‘within the shifting visual economy of both animal life and death’. Such a shift has facilitated the exploita- 161 </page> <page sequence="12"> Animal death tion of ‘real life’ animals for/in art: for instance, in some later 20th-cen- tury art involving chickens, the sense of transgression or estrangement has been produced through the use of actual birds (not painted or sculpted substitutes) for the art, by incorporating the skin, feathers, feet, meat or full carcasses of chickens into individual works. Such a ploy is not necessarily motivated by pro-animal sentiment or animal activism, as the art of Pinar Yolacan demonstrates: in her 2004 series entitled Perishable art, Yolacan involved chicken intestines, skins, feet, and heads in the formation of Victorian-style fashion garments mod- elled by women in their 70s. The dresses, embellished with ruffles, frills, and fancy collars, typ- ical of earlier fashion styles, and made from the flesh of recently killed chickens and other animals, were important to Yolacan’s focus on dis- rupting Western photographic portraiture tradition, not to any critique of the subjugation of animals in human cultures. Likewise, Elpida Hadzi-Vasileva used 3000 chicken skins (obtained from a halal butcher over many weeks) in her 2008 wall hanging ‘We are shadows’, com- missioned for an exhibition by the London Metropolitan University. Hadzi-Vasileva declared that the purpose of this piece was to emphasise the loss, struggle and conflict of immigrant communities (cited in Bris- tol Evening Press 2009). Hence, chicken bodies can be used in transgressive art that com- ments more on human concerns and issues; in other words, anthro- pocentric art which ultimately furthers the exploitation of chickenkind (Potts 2012).6 However, the same shifting ‘visual economy of animal life and death’ that results in the use of actual animals in anthropo- centric art has also led to the appearance of animal bodies in protest art that deliberately aims to counter animal exploitation. In this con- text, the practice of incorporating the skin, flesh and offal, heads and limbs of slaughtered animals in art works to draw attention to the living conditions and deaths of chickens themselves, and not to any 6 The use of chicken carcasses in ‘art’ is not exclusive to the 21st century. In 1964 Carolee Schneeman’s film Meat joy showed a group of people in various stages of undress writhing around together among flayed and featherless dead chickens. The purpose of this art was apparently to celebrate life while acknowledging the certainty of its underside, death, as well as to draw attention to the transience of life (the meat signifying the very visceral decay of the body). 162 </page> <page sequence="13"> 9 Picturing cruelty metaphorical or metaphysical human-centred concern. One such act- ivist artist is New Zealand-based Angela Singer who employs discarded parts of animals in her art in order to disrupt the conventional view that nonhuman beings are ‘naturally’ ours to use, kill and eat. For one exhib- ition in Auckland emphasising the parts of animals (stripped of their animal identity) that people use and ignore in their homes, Singer cre- ated a ‘chicken kitchen curtain’. She salvaged discarded chicken claws from a local butchery and attached these to a sheet comprised of latex and powder and painted the colour of the orange, fake chicken season- ing sprinkled on French fries. Here she explains what occurred: The chicken kitchen curtain hung in a small space, slightly out from the wall, the chicken claws stuck out and caught on people’s clothing when they walked too close. At the opening of the show I saw people react quite angrily, and some were revolted when they realized what the curtain was made of. There was another show opening in the gallery the same night. The finger food was chicken sushi so people were coming out of that show, and walking into my show eating chicken and getting upset about chicken claws! (Angela Singer, per- sonal communication, 29 September 2008). The critique of capitalism and animal exploitation is also central to the art of New York-based animal activist and self-described ‘visual journ- alist’ Sue Coe. Coe’s easily recognisable works are intended to shock; they portray explicit cruelty towards animals occurring within sci- entific laboratories, slaughterhouses, hatcheries, agribusiness and the entertainment industry. Not shying away from graphic scenes of chicken processing plants, or the agony of intensive farming practices such as debeaking and the killing of newly hatched male chicks, Coe’s work is inspired by a deep commitment to socio-political change, as well as the personal witnessing of such routine procedures in factory farming situations. In an interview with the LA Times, Coe stated: ‘I want [people] to investigate further . . . I’m not proselytizing. I’m say- ing, “Please see for yourself. Go to a slaughterhouse. See what occurs. And if you can’t, ask yourself why” ’ (cited in Vaughn 2009). Many of Coe’s works focus on pain and death. These motifs are common in an- imal art and representation, according to Burt. They draw attention to and reinforce an important symbolic – and even more significant prac- 163 </page> <page sequence="14"> Animal death tical – difference between humans and animals: humans assume the right to sacrifice or kill animals: ‘[sacrifice] is taken as defining the us and the them, it provides the criteria for the “noncriminal putting to death”, and the identity of those beings that it is acceptable to subject to total control’ (Burt 2008, 8). Visual culture experts also argue that animal art has the potential to disrupt assumptions about coherent species identity – not just that of the human, but of the animal as well (Burt 2009). In her activist art foregrounding the commodification and exploitation of chickens (as well as other farmed animals), Australian Yvette Watt aims to be confrontational and thought-provoking without unduly alienating the viewer. Watt’s series of paintings called Offerings, based on real life res- cued farm animals, features a portrait of Sally, a former battery hen now living on a farm sanctuary. Confusing the place of chicken and human, Sally’s face and upper body is painted onto a large white linen tea-towel in Watt’s own blood. Because this medium quickly changes to a sepia colour as it dries, Watt is able to ensure the viewer’s initial en- gagement is with the image of Sally, rather than the more sensational connotations of the painting’s medium: The intention is that, on discovering the nature of the painting me- dium used, the viewer will be caused to consider the matter of these animals as flesh and blood – and hence as meat. As such it was es- sential that the blood used was my blood, as I see these works as gestures of solidarity with those animals that are killed in their bil- lions for meat; as a kind of offering, a symbolic giving up of my blood, a recognition of the spilling of the blood of these animals for meat production and of the fact that their blood stains the kitchens of most homes (Watt, personal communication, 25 September 2009) More recently Watt has turned to documentary photography of large scale factory farms across Australia as a means of enabling viewers to engage with chickens (and pigs) as sentient beings rather than objecti- fied commodities. The images of intensive farms are taken by the artist from publicly accessible points such as roadsides; no trespassing is re- quired – for while the ‘farm animals’ themselves are concealed from the public, the enormous buildings incarcerating them are not. As Watt explains: ‘the absence of [chickens] in the imagery serves to highlight 164 </page> <page sequence="15"> 9 Picturing cruelty the hidden and secretive nature of the unnatural and restricted envir- onments endured by the [birds] housed inside the windowless sheds’. It also places the viewer in the position of having to imagine what ‘might be seen inside the sheds’ were they able to enter (personal communica- tion, 12 November 2012).7 Chicken advocacy in popular music When image and sound combine, the effect can be powerful. Musicians who are also chicken advocates have used their unique ability to reach out to listeners as well as viewers in their efforts to protest against the contemporary disregard and abuse of chickens. For instance, vegan musician Moby produced a video to accompany his song, ‘Disco lies’ (a piece whose lyrics focus on betrayal) involving a newly hatched chick who quickly realises, upon witnessing fellow chickens caged, slaughtered, decapitated and dismembered, that his kind has been de- ceived and abused by humans, and one human in particular. Luckily avoiding a similar fate, and growing up to become a human-sized (and fashionable) rooster, he sets off to seek retribution. The traitor turns out to be a debauched and greedy man closely resembling Colonel Sanders, whom the chicken hero pursues until he catches him by a chicken meat stall.

The lyrics in The Smith’s 1986 single, ‘Meat is murder’, from the album of the same name, expose the suffering inherent in meat production while the video accompanying this song features graphic imagery from a variety of farms and slaughterhouses, including broiler 7 Watt’s project is entitled ‘Animal factories: a visual investigation into the hidden lives of animals in industrial agriculture’ (2011–2012). 8 Retrieved 13 March 2013 from www.moby.com/discograpy/singles/ disco-lies.html. 165 </page> <page sequence="16"> Animal death sheds, battery farms and chicken meat processing plants.9 During Mor- rissey’s live concerts, performances of ‘Meat is murder’ are accompan- ied by shocking footage displayed on a large screen behind the band; this is not the limit of the audience’s exposure to the artist’s protest, however, as accompanying the live music, poignant lyrics of the song, and the explicit imagery of farms and slaughter, are the actual noises of the animals appearing on film.10 Conclusion Twenty years ago renowned biologist Lesley Rogers, author of Brain and development in the chicken (1995, 231), asserted that ‘there is a demand to understand the cognitive abilities of the domestic chicken above all avian species, because this bird is the one we have singled out for intensive farming. Gallus gallus domesticus is indeed the avian spe- cies most exploited and least respected’. Recently, prominent African- American author Alice Walker (2006, 170) questioned humans’ con- tinued reticence to acknowledge and truly engage with chickens as sentient beings: ‘ “Why do you keep putting off writing about me?” It is the voice of a chicken that asks this’. The key to a more compas- sionate and respectful future for our species’ relationship with Gallus gallus domesticus lies in re-establishing the kind of esteem in which these birds were once held. The dominance of intensive farming has rendered invisible not just the suffering of the birds it subjects, but also the knowledge and appreciation that many human societies once had of the ways in which chickens lived naturally. As a result, it has become easy to dismiss chickens as unworthy of consideration. Asso- ciated with dim-wittedness and cowardice – the very opposite of the traits that humans perceived in hens and cockerels prior to industri- 9 See www.youtube.com/verify_age?next_url=/watch%3Fv%3D06c5Srk3fxM. 10 The authors, who attended a Morrissey concert in New York in October 2012, were bemused by the reaction of the audience, many of whom used various tactics to avoid the images and noises derived from the footage on screen. Some people left, others kept their heads down and did not watch the video. ‘Meat is murder’ was performed for longer than any other song on that night, and afterwards we observed that applause was muted. 166 </page> <page sequence="17"> 9 Picturing cruelty alisation – factory-farmed chickens are made easily killable, and their suffering is made inconsequential. For chicken advocates, then, there is still much to be done in returning to visibility not just the suffering and death of farmed chickens, but also their lives, their beings and their natures. For contemporary urban dwellers, whose own lives so often remain distant from those of living chickens, the proliferating and ever- changing world of visual culture offers the most promising domain in which this kind of reconnection can take place.
