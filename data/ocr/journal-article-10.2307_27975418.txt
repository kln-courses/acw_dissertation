<plain_text><page sequence="1">Conferences EUROPEAN ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL ANTHROPOLOGISTS 11th Biennial Conference, Maynooth, Ireland, 24-27 August 2010 The town of Maynooth provided a delightful backdrop to this year's EASA conference, Crisis and imagination. Let me highlight for attention two workshops out of the 125, some of which overlapped in their aims and interests. Crises, crossings and other worlds: exploring the invisible, the liminal and the virtual, convened by Stuart McLean, Rane Willerslev and Bruce Kapferer, interrogated how an anthropology of a mul tiplicity of worlds could break constricting couplings such as identity/difference, singular/ plural and positive/negative, or reimagine such couplings in radically alternate forms. The workshop Beyond the biological and the social: Anthropology as the study of human becomings, convened by G?sli P?lsson and Tim Ingold, explored the recurring theme of 'becomings'. As several of the speakers asserted, if life is thought of as always On the make', so to speak, with no fundamental deter mining basis and no absolute end(s), then nei ther the social nor the biological can function as the primordial basis of life. We must there fore move beyond a biological-social split. This workshop was so successful that the convenors and presenters have now formed a 'Biosocial Becomings' network within EASA. The first panel of the Beyond the biological and the social workshop explored what might be involved if we went beyond a biological and social split, and moved towards a notion of 'becomings'. P?lsson's paper brought together insights from Marx, ethnography, social theory and epigenetics (the study of how the function or expression of genes changes in ways that cannot be explained by a change to the under lying DNA). In an attempt to think beyond current debates surrounding post-humanism and the social/biological and nature/culture divides, P?lsson proposed a notion of 'human becomings' as configurations of ensembles of biosocial relations. Lenny Moss, a biologist and philosopher, pointed to how the biological non-specialization of humans entails a form of 'soft-naturalism' in which humans do not merely 'live a life' but must rather 'lead a life'. Tim Ingold and Agust?n Fuentes offered dif fering takes on the insights that evolutionary biology and anthropology might afford one another. Fuentes argued against the concepts of biological and social becomings as distinct, rather envisioning them as intertwined and integrated actors in the processes of becoming human. Ingold ended the panel by highlighting the importance of anthropologists' insights, which have led to more open and less deter ministic accounts of evolutionary development. The theme of breaking out of the con straining distinction between the social and biological was maintained throughout the day. Eugenia Ramirez-Goicoechea insisted that human environments are at the core of how humans become in their own particular ways. Aglaia Chatjouli described how sufferers of thalassaemia (an inherited blood disorder that affects the production of haemoglobin) become sites for constant biomedicai treatment and experimentation due to their condition, and revealed some of the existential implica tions of such practices. Gaetano Mangiameli, who argued that an understanding of human becomings calls for an ethnography of non human becomings, was well supported by Vito Laterza's paper. Istv?n Praet put forward a compelling picture of 'humanity' as a category requiring continuous 'fabrication', with refer ence to his ethnographic work amongst the Chachi of Ecuador. The day was brought to a close by discussant Deborah Heath, who high lighted the different theoretical and intellectual commitments of the session's papers and drew attention to wider academic debates which impact on the theme of life - human and non human - as 'becoming'. In another building, the Crises, crossings and other worlds: Exploring the invisible, the liminal and the virtual workshop began with an attack on one of anthropology's sacred cows: immersion in a cultural-material world as the condition for acquiring insights into that world. Matei Candea suggestively argued that anthropologists might find some sympathy with the techniques of field biologists who are explicitly sceptical of anthropomorphism and who carefully set up procedures for detached interspecies relations. As the title of the work shop suggests, the day's papers had strong Deleuzian influences. Morten Nielsen, for instance, claimed to extend understandings of virtuality by examining social life as its 'actu alised negation'. Anne-Marie Colpron outlined how the shamans of the Shipibo-Conibo people of the Western Amazon conceptualize multiple 'worlds' which transcend categories of real/ imaginary, visible/invisible. This metaphysical thread was taken on in a different vein by Sasha Rubel: can 'video work', filming and filmed ritual, express simultaneous multiple worlds and interrogate the links between the invisible, the liminal, and the virtual? Stuart McLean turned to the landscapes of otherworld journeys in mythology and folklore to engage with the idea of reality as simultaneously one and multiple, and examined the role of mythopoetic imagination in anthropological understanding. Both workshops, in their own ways, point to the great complexity of anthropological thought relating to the world, life, personhood and being. As anthropological categories are constantly rejected for newer terms in the hope of catching up with the world, the workshops indicate that the very ways we investigate and record world, being, space and place are part of the intellectual problem. Thus, radically alter native forms of thought are required, which must be open and unstable enough to ensure we do not close off important parts of the world from anthropological inquiry. We need creative ways of thinking about the human condition and our relations to the world. This conference was successful in the way it facilitated in-depth presentation and discus sion of cutting-edge research of this kind. That such conferences take place across European borders and in a variety of European settings is a bonus. ? Hayder Al-Mohammad University of Kent hayderalmohammad@googlemail.com</page></plain_text>
