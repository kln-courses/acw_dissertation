Knopf. 460 pp. $27.50 Armstrong's sweeping history of the idea of God is something of a hybrid. Parts of it read like philosophy and theology; parts might best be described as the history of human psychology. The book as a whole reflects the experiences of its author, who, she tells us, spent seven disap- pointing years as a Roman Catholic nun, lost her faith, left the order, and turned to the study of the history of religion. Today, she teaches at a rab- binical institute and is affiliated with the Asso- ciation of Muslim Social Scientists. Armstrong organizes her sprawling material around the simple notion that seeking God, or seeking an overarching meaning to the universe under whatever name, is just one of those things that human beings do. As many times as the mono- theistic idea disappoints them or fails to accord with events, humans come back with yet another varia- tion to bring their God into conformity with what they've learned. This process has given rise to an endless oscillation between conceptions such as the serenely impersonal God of Ari- stotle - unmoved mover at the top of the hierar- chy of forms, existing in the state of divine and unregarding apatheia toward the Creation - and the personalized deity in such forms as Jesus. Much of this is familiar, though it becomes less so once Armstrong traces the same patterns into the rationalist and mystic movements that followed the emergence of Islam. 'Just as there are 90 WQ WINTER 1994</page><page sequence="2">only a given number of themes in love poetry," she argues, "so too people have kept saying the same things about God over and over again." The image is of a constant systole and diastole of belief: The monotheistic vision, while exercising what appears to be an irresistible draw on the imaginations of people born with a certain "spiri- tual talent," is just abstract enough to be exceed- ingly difficult to maintain. Slippage recurs in sev- eral directions: toward idolatry, the reduction of God or God's will to some person or small part of the ideal; toward the anthropomorphism that fi- nally makes it difficult to see the divinity as a Be- ing of a radically different order of existence from oneself; or, the opposite danger, toward the Pla- tonic idealism that becomes so remote that people cease to apply human standards of decency or logic to whaf s seen as God-inspired. As for the future, Armstrong suggests, "The anthropomorphic idea of God as Lawgiver and Ruler is not ad- equate to the temper of postmodernity." Though the tone veers occasionally, as here, toward the peremptory, the author surely is en- titled to a few wobbles in the course of writing 400 pages on the (by definition) inexpressible. The compendium hangs together because of her unfailing warmth of appreciation for the human phenomena she records: the steady pull toward the "particularly difficult virtue" of compassion and the continual "shock of human surprise and wonder" that anything should exist at all.</page></plain_text>
