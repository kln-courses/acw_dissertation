Children's Press, 1224 West Van Buren St., Chicago, Illinois 60607. 1976. Rabbits, mice, and foxes are discussed in the first volume and moose and other grass-eaters are treated in the second. The story line is interesting, the nar- rative well done. The illustrations are creditable, though not very uniform in quality. A few minor objections: the treatment of snowshoe hares as rabbits; the poten- tial confusion resulting from the treat- ment of coyotes as brush wolves; and the failure to suggest that pr√©dation of fawns may benefit the grass-eater herd. In general, there seems to be a tendency to denigrate professional biologists, though that need not be a criticism. All of these objections are over- shadowed by the author's propensity for anthropomorphism. To call ants "smart" because they have a social structure, or to assume that some rabbits play "fox and geese" in the snow, seems to credit them with unreasonable (and un- demonstrated) talent and intelligence. It seems doubtful that anthropomorphic conclusions and interpretations of animal behavior lead to a better under- standing of animals. RudyG. Koch</page></plain_text>
