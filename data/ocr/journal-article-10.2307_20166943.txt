<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Olmec Maize God The face of corn in Formative Mesoamerica KARL TAUBE In both ancient and contemporary Mesoamerica, no other foodstuff has had a more profound role in social and cultural development than corn, or Zea mays. Although a great deal is now known about the importance of maize in Classic and Postclassic Mesoamerican economies and religion, there has been surprisingly little iconographie interest in its significance in the earlier Formative period (the Mesoamerican equivalent of the Old World Neolithic) despite the fact that the Formative marks the initial widespread appearance of food production. In this study, I will argue that the Formative Olmec developed an elaborate system of belief and ritual surrounding maize. Moreover, I will suggest that much of the Olmec influence noted for Formative highland Mexico and the Maya region revolved around this ritual agricultural complex and served as a means to integrate distant regions into the Olmec economic network. In his seminal analysis of Olmec iconography, Peter David Joralemon (1971:32-33) was the first to systematically identify maize motifs in Formative Olmec art. Among the more diagnostic signs that Joralemon (ibid.) describes are Motif 81, "banded maize," Motif 89, "tripartite maize," and Motif 93, "maize with flowing silk" (fig. 1). Whereas Motif 93 represents a silk tipped cob within a U-shaped husk, Motif 81 depicts the exposed cob alone. For Motif 89, the central cob is flanked by outwardly curving vegetation creating a form resembling a fleur-de-lis. Coe (1968:111) and Joralemon (1971:59-66) note that one Olmec entity commonly displays maize signs emerging from its cleft head (fig. 2c-d). In view of the prominent corn imagery, Coe and Joralemon interpret this being as a maize deity, labeled God II in the Joralemon (1971:59-66) classificatory system. However, the maize identification of God II has received only limited acceptance. In her excellent discussion of maize iconography in Olmec and early Maya art, Virginia Fields (1991) makes no mention of an Olmec maize deity, although she includes many motif 81 ^&lt;f motif 89 motif 93 Figure 1.

Similarly, in his recent doctoral dissertation, Reilly (1994:181-182) relates this being to maize and the axis mundi, but he does not identify it as a maize god. Moreover, Joyce Marcus (1989:173-174) has reasonably argued that Formative depictions of maize growing out of cleft heads serve to qualify the cleft head not as maize but as the earth from which corn grows. The uncertain identity of God II largely derives from the puzzling lack of discussion or analysis of this important being after the original insights of Coe and Joralemon. Neither these researchers nor other investigators have provided a detailed argument of why this being is the Olmec Maize God. In view of recent developments in Olmec and Maya iconographie research, a reappraisal of God II is clearly in order. This paper provides direct support for the maize identity of God II, although I also suggest that three other beings of the Joralemon (1971 ) system of deity classification? Gods IV, VI, and X?are also aspects of the Olmec Maize God as phases in the growth cycle of corn.</page><page sequence="4">42 RES 29/30 SPRING/AUTUMN 1996 The green maize ear It has been noted that God II, the Olmec Maize God, commonly has an ear of corn emerging from his cleft head. Rather than representing maize sprouting out of the earth, this convention depicts the mature ear projecting out of the green, surrounding husk. The cleft evidently is created by two overlapping husk leaves, or bracts, enclosing the lower portion of the maize ear. In one representation of the Olmec Maize God from Arroyo Pesquero, the V-shaped cleft is clearly composed of outcurving bracts, here marked with parallel striations (fig. 3b). With the cleft cranial husk, the entire head of the Olmec Maize God can be regarded as a maize ear. This convention immediately recalls the Maya Maize God, who has a cranium rendered as the maize cob (fig. 16f, 24). It would appear that in both cultures, the act of harvesting was equated with decapitation, the severing of the maize head from the growing stalk.1 In Olmec art, it is possible to see the transition from the schematic cleft cob form to realistically depicted maize ears. On one jadeite celt from La Venta, the maize ear, central cleft, and projecting cob are surrounded by a U-shaped element that is bifurcated at the upper ends (fig. 3c). This same cleft bracket appears in profile flanking the head of the Olmec Maize God, in this case personified with another face of the corn deity (fig. 3a). According to Joralemon (1971:58), these cleft elements denote vegetal growth, and thus the celt examples could depict leaves surrounding the mature ear. This same motif is repeated on a late Olmec celt, although here the bifurcated elements are now separate from the central ear and cob (fig. 3d). In a still later scene, quite possibly Late Formative, the flanking forms are explicit maize leaves (fig. 3e). The central maize ear is clearly portrayed as a mature cob projecting out of a V-shaped cleft created by the enveloping bracts.2 The maize ear and green celts Joralemon (1988:38) notes that a great many examples of the Olmec Maize God appear on jadeite celts and that such green celts probably represent ears of corn. The Arroyo Pesquero seated jadeite figure in the collections of Dumbarton Oaks wears a pendant back element formed of five hanging feathers with three simple celts, two cleft examples, and finally, three tasseled maize cobs (fig. 4a). The cleft forms appear to be supplied with long, twisting roots and, like the bifurcated elements described by Joralemon (1971:58), probably allude to green, growing maize. It appears that this back assemblage represents the transition from jade celt to growing, foliated cleft celt and finally to the tasseled cob. Benson (1971:13) suggests that the hanging back elements could be jade ornaments and indeed, for the Classic Maya, this is the preferred region for wearing jade belt celts, which typically hang in groups of three from a mask worn in the small of the back. The Dumbarton Oaks figure seems to wear an early version of the belt celts that commonly appear on Late Preclassic and Classic elite costume. Pendant belt celts occur among the Middle Formative Olmec and can be identified by their thin, slablike forms and the presence of a single drilled hole for suspension (for example, fig. 8d). Two of the flying figures on La Venta Stela 2 wear such celts hanging from their belts (fig. 4b). The standing figure from the Early Classic Stela 6 of Cerro de las Mesas wears a similar celt in a virtually identical position (fig. 4c). In this case, it is marked with the diagonal bands known in Maya iconography as "mirror markings," a means of depicting a shining, reflective surface such as would appear on mirrors and polished jade. Among the Classic Zapotee, maize cobs were depicted as if they were shining celts. The Zapotee day name known as Glyph J is a vertical maize cob supplied with foliation (fig. 4d). The cob is typically rendered with the aforementioned diagonal band mirror marking, which commonly appears on celts. On one ?poca de Transici?n urn from Monte Alban, the seated figure wears a pectoral mask with three pendant celts (figs. 4e, 11a). Provided with diagonal bands, the celts are identical to the element serving as the central maize cob of Glyph J. The Classic Maya also depicted maize ears as shining celts. Thus in one Early Classic representation of the Maize God, the green maize ear is shown with precisely the same mirror markings appearing on pendant belt celts (fig. 4f-g). Similar banded cobs continue in Late Classic Maya iconography (fig. 4h). Rather than representing a shining mirror, the vertical oval sign commonly appearing in the name glyph of the Maya Maize God probably represents a polished stone celt (see Taube 1992:fig. 17a). Among the most distinctive traits of the Olmec Maize God is a complex headband formed of four vertical 1. As in later Classic Maya art, the cranial deformation observed in Olmec art probably alludes to the form of the maize cob (see Drucker 1952:pls. 46:2, 47^8, 50:8-9; Drucker 1959:pls. 33-36). 2. The convention of a V-shaped cleft to represent the cob enclosing bracts is not limited to the Olmec but occurs independently in Nazca iconography of south coastal Peru (see Mosely 1992:fig. 86).</page><page sequence="5">Taube: The Olmec Maize God 43 Figure 4.

On several Arroyo Pesquero portrayals of the Olmec Maize God, the four vertical elements are positioned in four corners around the central deity (fig. 2c-e). Reilly (1994:179) astutely notes that by donning the five-part headband, the figure is portrayed as the pivotal axis mundi. Marcus (1989:172-173) and Reilly (1994:227-228) suggest that the Olmec bar-and-four-dots motif is simply an abstract version of the upright world axis surrounded by the four directions as is illustrated on the three Arroyo Pesquero celts (fig. 6).3 Freidel, Schele, and Parker (1993:73-74) note that in Classic Maya thought, the Maize God serves as the world axis by which the heavens are raised.4 Moreover, it appears that one of the major Classic Maya acts of creation was the donning of a triple-stone headband by the Maize God. This was tantamount to raising the central, three-stone hearth into the heavens (Taube n.d.). Much of this Classic imagery probably derives from the headband of the Olmec Maize God, although, in the case of the Olmec, the reference was to the four corners rather than the pivotal hearth. The four vertical elements appearing in the headband and surrounding the Olmec Maize God are cleft maize ear celts typically with the mature cob projecting out of the splitting husk (fig. 5a). Of course, these elements are essentially simplified versions of the Olmec Maize God head, which usually has a cob emerging out of a central cranial cleft (fig. 5b-d). At times, the maize celts are supplied with the eyes of the Olmec Maize God, which tend to slant upward at the outer corners (figs. 5a, 7a). In addition, the celts and the brow of the maize god frequently display the double-merlon motif, a device that I (Taube 1995:91) have recently identified as the Olmec sign for green (fig. 2b, d-e). The use of the Olmec Maize God and the four-celt cobs to represent the four directions and the center suggests that the four sided cosmic milpa model known for the later Maya was present among the Middle Formative Olmec. Like the related house metaphor for the universe, the milpa model signifies culturally constructed and ordered space. The seated Dumbarton Oaks jadeite figure wears an especially elaborate form of the four-celt headband, each celt seemingly personified with the face of the maize deity (fig. 7a). Debra George has made the fascinating observation that the four varying elements occurring on the lower face of the personified celts may indicate distinct stages in the annual cycle of corn (pers. comm. 1995). She suggests that one begins at the viewer's left with the circular crossed band sign as the seed that develops into a cleft celt for growing corn, then a lanceolate-like form for the mature cob, and finally, the harvested maize. Although the fourth and last element remains poorly understood, the other three examples do appear to represent distinct aspects of the Olmec Maize God as phases in the annual cycle of corn. With its crossed bands cartouche across the lower face, the first form may well allude to the infant figure labeled as God IV in the Joralemon (1971:71-76) system of deity classification. Along with wearing folded-paper ear strips and a headband marked with two elements, this figure commonly displays prominent crossed bands on his pectoral and belt. Whereas Coe (1968:11, 89) and Joralemon (1971:90) identified this infant as the Olmec Rain God, I have recently suggested that the Olmec rain deity was actually a mature, anthropomorphized feline with prominent canines, deeply furrowed brow, and eyes turning downward at the outer corners (Taube 1995). Moreover, the infant God IV overlaps considerably with the mature Olmec Maize God, or God II. Along with displaying the slanted eyes and cleft brow of the Olmec Maize God, God IV can also have maize growing out of the center of the head (for example, fig. 22c). In addition, God II also occurs with the paper ear ornaments and crossed-bands pectoral of God IV (figs. 13a, c, 27c). Although it is beyond the scope of this study to provide an in-depth analysis of this important being, the infant God IV may represent seed corn used for planting.5 The use of human development to represent phases of corn growth coincides with contemporary Gulf Coast belief and is reflected in the Sierra Popoluca conception of the corn god Homshuk 3. By being placed on its side, the central axis becomes the marked focus of the bar-and-four-dots motif. However, this placement also results in presenting centrality as a linear arrangement with the dots symmetrically flanking the central element. This would explain the elaborate concern with bilateral symmetry observed at La Venta Group A. As in the case of the bar-and-four-dots motif, the linear arrangement at Group A portrays the essential theme of central ity and the world axis through bilateral rather than quadrilateral symmetry. 4. Brian Stross (1992:102) also argues that the Maize God served as the axis mundi among both the Olmec and later Classic Maya. The concept of maize as the central world axis was also present in Late Postclassic Central Mexico. In the year bearer and world directional passages on pages 49 to 53 of the Codex Borgia, the fifth and central world tree is portrayed as a mature maize plant. 5. In one Late Classic Maya scene, an infant Maize God appears in a bowl affixed to a large, vegetal bundle, quite probably labeling the contents as harvested corn (see Clarkson 1978:fig. 10).</page><page sequence="7">Taube: The Olmec Maize God 45 Figure 5.

Quite frequently, the cranial cleft turns sharply 6. In a like manner, Gillett Griffin (1981:215) identifies the child held in the lap of the Las Limas Figure?one of the most diagnostic examples of the infant God IV?as "a baby corn god."</page><page sequence="8">46 RES 29/30 SPRING/AUTUMN 1996 Figure 6.

A series of dots often line the sides of the facial banding (for example, fig. 7b-c) and in this regard it should be noted that both the vertical facial banding and the flanking dots appear on the headband example marked with the cleft celt (fig. 7a). Rather than constituting an entirely distinct being, this figure also merges with God II and the infant God IV.

Moreover, the four sculptures lining the sunken courtyard at Teopantecuanitlan display the four-celt headband of God II, the crossed-bands pectoral of God IV, and on the sides, the backward-sweeping "hammer-claw" cranium of God VI (fig. 27c). An example of God II attributed to Arroyo Pesquero also displays the backward-projecting cranial cleft (fig. 2e). When vertical, the cranial cleft of God VI is essentially identical to that of God II except that it lacks the central ear of mature corn. Quite probably, the lack of the central cob and often backwardly projecting cleft head of God VI allude to the young, flexible stage of tender growing corn. Nonetheless, in one instance, the backward cleft contains an ear of corn quite like that appearing on the lower face of the third headband example (figs. 2b, 7a). It appears that the central cranial cob is an important but not essential trait of the Olmec Maize God. For the four-part browpiece, the cleft celtiform ears can also lack the central cob (fig. 5a). Moreover, in his examples of God II, Joralemon (1971 :fig. 186) includes one figure that simply has a prominent cleft head with no central cob. This example is identical to God X in the Joralemon (ibid., 86) system of deity classification: a figure displaying the typical cleft head, slanted eyes, and mouth of the Olmec Maize God. This figure can also appear with the facial lines of God VI, which in some instances occur as schematic facial profiles of the corn deity (ibid., figs. 26-27, 257). Coe (1989:76) notes that the God X figure commonly has a pair of vertical, mucuslike nostril elements that tend to pass down to the lip. This curious feature is by no means limited to God X but is also commonly shared with Gods II, IV, and VI (figs. 2d-e, 3a, 7b-c, 25d, 27b-c; see also, Joralemon 1971:figs. 174-175, 211, 233-234, 237, 239). Although evidently an important trait of the Olmec Maize God, it is difficult to relate this nasal element to any natural feature of corn. The lower face of the third headband celt is marked by the outline of a mature cob (fig. 7a). This plump and pointed form is much like cobs appearing in the cranial cleft of the mature Olmec Maize God and the central cob in the Olmec trefoil maize sign, including an example on the same Dumbarton Oaks figure (figs. 2b, 6b, 13b, 26e, 27b). Moreover, the Olmec Maize God topping the Dumbarton Oaks statuette wears a series of these lanceolate-shaped cobs as his four-celt headband (fig. 5e). The diagonal banding found with the third celt face also occurs with the mature, naked cob marking the middle place between the four celts (figs. 7d, 8a). Displaying horizontal as well as diagonal banding, this central cob is very similar to one sprouting out of the head of an Olmec Maize God attributed to Arroyo Pesquero (figs. 2c, 7e). This third celt probably represents God II, the personification of mature corn. Reilly (1994:189, fig. 4.81) compares the central cob and third celt to the world tree appearing on Chalcatzingo Monument 21 (fig. 7f). With its horizontal and diagonal banding, the Chalcatzingo tree could best be identified as a great cob serving as the central axis mundi. The curious lozengelike forms on the diagonal bands could well refer to maize grains. One Classic Zapotee example of Glyph J portrays the maize ear similarly marked with segmented diagonal banding (fig. 7g). Both Elizabeth Benson (1971:17-19) and Kent Reilly (1994:186) note that the Dumbarton Oaks statuette is very similar to a stone sculpture from San Martin Pajapan (fig. 8b). Reilly (ibid., 186-187) interprets this monument as a ruler in the act of raising the world tree. The heads of both figures are marked with long, parallel lines suggesting hair or feathers as well the backcurving, cleft cranium denoting young, growing maize. On the Dumbarton Oaks figure, a pair of lines formed of U brackets and lozenges runs down the back of the head (see Benson 1971:fig. 12). This pattern in precisely the same position appears in a profile representation of the Olmec Maize God (fig. 2b). This banding strongly resembles the later Classic Maya star sign and is quite probably a version of the dotted band commonly found on the God VI aspect of the Olmec Maize God. ?ngulo (1987:141) notes that Chalcatzingo Monument 13 is very much like the San Martin Pajapan monument and may have also originally represented a figure with a bar in its hands (fig. 8c). Whereas the Dumbarton Oaks and San Martin Pajapan sculptures seem to be living individuals impersonating this being, the Chalcatzingo monument may represent the foliated Olmec Maize God raising the world axis. Along with the four-celt headband, the Dumbarton Oaks figure wears a skirt, suspenders, and a feather cape and tailpiece. Michael Coe (1992:62) notes that this costuming is very similar to that appearing on an incised, late Olmec, jadeite belt celt (fig. 8d). In addition to the four-celt headband and other costume elements, the figure also wears the backcurving, foliated headdress. A diminutive breast is depicted in profile revealing that like the skirted figure on Chalcatzingo Monument 21, this individual is a woman (see fig. 7f). In view of the skirt and other shared costume elements, the Dumbarton Oaks figure probably is also female, perhaps even the same individual.

The celt figure wears a profile view of essentially the same image in an identical position, again with a flanking knuckle-duster and a trilobate maize growth sprouting out of the cleft head (fig. 8d).7 With its central cranial cleft and slightly out-flaring brow, the Olmec Maize God atop the celt figure closely resembles a personified celt, although here with the face projecting out of the flat contour of the stone. This image can be readily compared to the Las Limas Figure, which has four similar personified cleft celts upon the shoulders and knees (fig. 9a). Series of cleft celts frequently appear on the bodies of Middle Formative Olmec figures, including the Dumbarton Oaks sculpture, which has simple cleft celts on the ankles and arms (figs. 8a, 9b-d). Although uncleft, celts also appear on the ankles and probably hands of the aforementioned incised celt figure (fig. 8d). I suspect that like the four celts placed around the Olmec Maize God or upon its brow, these body celts cause the wearer to become the world axis, a vital conduit of divine power from the quarters of the world. Aside from the cleft celts appearing much like tattooing directly on the body, the Olmec also lashed actual celts to their limbs. On La Venta Stela 3, a skirted woman with the four-celt headband also has a pair of simple celts tied to her upper arms (fig. 10a). The flying, caped Olmec Maize God on the right arm of "Slim" also displays bound celts on his upper arms (fig. 10b). The late Olmec acrobat in the center of the Shook Panel has celts on his wrists as well as upper arms (fig. 10c). Wearing an early form of the three-stone headband as well as a tasseled ear of corn at the back of his head, this figure can be identified as the Olmec Maize God. In the Late Preclassic art of Izapa, a number of deity figures wear axe heads bound to their limbs (fig. 10d-f). In these scenes, the celtiform shape is clearly evident with a widening bit and narrow poll. On Izapa Stela 1, Chac has pairs of celts lashed to each of his legs whereas on Stela 3 the blades are tied to the lower arms and shins (fig. 10d, f). The placement of celts on the limbs of figures continues into the proto-Classic and Classic periods. On one ?poca de Transici?n urn from Tomb 41 at Monte Alban, the seated figure has celts bound to his upper arms (fig. 11a). His distinctive facial markings identify him as a proto-Classic form of the God of Glyph L, the Classic Zapotee Maize God (see Caso and Bernai 1952:94). Tikal Stela 39, a late-fourth-century Maya monument, portrays king Jaguar Paw with smoking and shining celts bound to his anklets (fig. 11b). The presence of shining celts on the legs of Jaguar Paw is to my knowledge a unique Classic Maya example. Indeed, it appears that by the Classic period, this Olmec tradition of celts against the body generally had transformed into the shining "god-markings" appearing on Maya deities. First noted by Michael Coe (1973:13), these markings are oval forms placed on the limbs and torsos of supernatural (fig. 12c-d). They are usually rendered with shining "mirror" markings that appear on mirrors, celts, and other polished stones. Both body celts and god-markings appear in the art of Late Preclassic Kaminaljuyu. On Stela 21, the principal figure has a celt lashed to his arm (fig. 12a). With its interior parallel line and elliptical profile, this example closely resembles god-markings despite the fact that it is clearly bound across the arm. However, the dancing figures upon Kaminaljuyu Stela 19 and the closely related Stela 4 display similar limb elements directly upon the skin as god-markings (fig. 12b). Like the Olmec placement of celts upon the body, the Maya god-markings delineate divine figures as charged sources of supernatural power. The celt as the world axis For the Middle Formative Olmec, representations of the Olmec Maize God are not limited to small, portable objects of jade or ceramic. At La Venta, a number of stelae were erected as monumental portrayals of this being. James Porter (1996) notes that there are four similar La Venta stelae, Monuments 25/6, 27, 58, and 66. Of these, Monuments 25/6 and 27 are the best preserved (fig. 13b-c). Both are clear representations of the Olmec Maize God complete with the four-celt headband. Noting the similarity of these monuments to a frontal depiction of the Olmec Maize God incised on an Arroyo Pesquero jadeite celt (fig. 13a), Porter argues that the Olmec compared these upright monuments to celts. In support, Porter notes that both were carved from green stone: Monument 25/6 of green schist and Monument 27 of green gneiss. In addition, Porter (ibid.) points out that the six miniature stela in the La Venta Offering 4 group are actually jadeite celts (see Drucker et al. 1959:142-158). A similar argument can be made 7. An Olmec-style stela from Tiltepec, Chiapas, displays a frontal figure also wearing a headdress topped by the Olmec Maize God flanked by "knuckle-dusters." As in the case of the other examples, a trefoil maize sign sprouts from the top of the deity head (see Milbrath 1979:fig. 51).</page><page sequence="13">Taube: The Olmec Maize God 51 for La Venta Offering Number 8 in which three groups of celts were planted blade upright across the central axis of Group A (see ibid., 1 74-1 76, pi. 41 a). Aside from the La Venta monuments, Chalcatzingo Monument 24 is also a celtiform stela with a strongly tapering butt resembling the narrow poll of a stone axe (see Grove and ?ngulo 1987:fig. 9.22). The four celts placed around the maize deity are also typically planted poll downward in the ground (fig. 6d-f). According to Reilly (1994), La Venta Monuments 25/6 and 27 are world trees. With their representations of the Olmec Maize God, these celtiform stelae probably denote the trees that raised the sky, if not the axis mundi itself. However, rather than simply being trees, their form and iconography also suggest that they are upright celts as if planting the axe blade also a b c d Figure 9.

Two thrones from San Lorenzo suggest that this concept existed among the Early Formative Olmec (fig. 14a-c). It has been recently noted that Potrero Nuevo Monument 2 depicts two dwarfs lifting the sky (Miller and Taube 1993:155; Taube 1995). Coe and Diehl (1980:368) note that this monument is very similar to San Lorenzo Monument 18. Although heavily damaged, Monument 18 was clearly another throne with two Atlantean dwarfs supporting the now missing seat with one arm apiece. With the other arm, each dwarf holds an upright celt in the center of his body. It would appear that in this scene both the upright celts and the dwarfs support the sky. Coe and Diehl (ibid., 327) note that the celts on Monument 18 are held in opposite positions, one clasped bit-upward and the other poll-upward (fig. 14b-c). A similar pattern can be discerned on the two loincloths of the Potrero Nuevo Monument 2 dwarfs (fig. 14a). Whereas one loincloth flares upward, the other flares down. This subtle distinction is neither casual nor fortuitous. These loincloths, like the Monument 18 celts, occur on the central axis of the bodies. Moreover, it is clear that the Olmec compared the form of loincloths to celts. A fine jadeite statuette in the collections of Dumbarton Oaks portrays the loincloth simply as a prominent projecting celt (fig. 14d). Although this celt also suggests a phallus, similar forms on jadeite and serpentine figurines from La Venta occur with a horizontal waist band revealing that it is the central part of the loincloth (fig. 14e). For the Olmec, the central, hanging loincloth apron was compared metaphorically to the celt and the world axis. A similar pattern is known for the Classic Maya. Schele and Miller (1986:72) note that Classic Maya</page><page sequence="16">54 RES 29/30 SPRING/AUTUMN 1996 rulers commonly wear loincloth aprons displaying images of the world tree, thereby denoting the king as the axis mundi (fig. 15b-c). It should also be noted that the triple-celt belt assemblages are most commonly suspended directly atop the loincloth in the same region as the celt on the Dumbarton Oaks statuette.8 In one Late Classic scene illustrating the defeat of Vucub Caquix, the deified world tree has three fruits in its branches, one placed in the region of the forehead (fig. 15a). Supplied with the mirror markings commonly found on celts, these fruits are probably the symbolic analog of the three belt-celts worn atop the loincloth with the entire tree alluding to the loincloth and celt assemblage.9 Among the Olmec and later Classic Maya, vertical celts were identified with central ity and the axis mundi. A similar concept is known for the Postclassic Mixtee. An early colonial creation account recorded by Fray Gregorio Garc?a describes the old creator couple 1 Deer living in a palace atop a mountain near Apoala. At the highest point of this palace, there was a copper axe with its bit supporting the heavens: Y encima de los m?s alto de la casa y habitaci?n de estos dioses, estaba una hacha de cobre, el corte hacia arriba, sobra la cual estaba el cielo. Esta pe?a y palacios estaban en un cerro muy alto, junto al pueblo de Apoala. . . . Esta pe?a ten?a por nombre 'lugar donde estaba el cielo.' Le?n-Portilla 1984:91 Alfonso Caso (1960:23) and Jill F?rst (1978:58) note that this mythical place is depicted in the pre-Hispanic Codex Bodley as a vertical axe with its blade turned up toward the sky (fig. 16a). F?rst (ibid.) suggests that Vienna pages 38 and 47 may also depict the same place but states that the sky-supporting element is not an axe blade but a black and red post (fig. 16b-d). However, this black and red element is actually the naked blade without the handle, much like the Garcia description. The strait-edged bit, the banding, and the frequently out-flaring outline resemble axe heads appearing in both pre-Hispanic Mixtee and Maya codices (fig. 16e-g). This form is quite unlike pointed or curving axe blades of chipped stone. Fray Diego de Landa illustrates an axe with a virtually identically shaped blade (fig. 16h) along with a valuable description: "They had little hatchets of a particular metal, of this form, which they fitted to a wooden handle, and it served them as a weapon and in turn for carving wood. They gave an edge by blows with a stone, since the metal is soft" (Tozzer 1941:121). This malleable metal was surely copper, which was widely traded in Postclassic Mesoamerica. The strait-edged axe heads seen in the Maya and Mixtee codices, including the Mixtee toponym, are probably of copper. The sign for "the place where the sky was" in the Vienna obverse and the Codex Nuttall is formed of a banded black and red axe blade accompanied by a starry sky band, which usually occurs atop the axe (fig. 16b-d). This sign appears on pages 9, 38, 45, and 47 of the strongly mythological Vienna obverse and each time is paired with another black and red axe placed in the open mouth of the serpent (fig. 16c). This same pairing of sky and serpent maw also occurs in the aforementioned Bodley scene where a serpent mouth appears at the base of the temple below the sky band. In the Mixtee codices, such serpent mouths represent cave entrances to the underworld, and this pairing probably refers to the regions of sky and underworld accessed by the axis mundi. On page 9 of the Vienna obverse, three copper axe heads are placed on mountains (fig. 16b). Whereas the central blade is marked with the sky sign, both flanking axe heads are in serpent maws, one blade pointing up and the other down, recalling San Lorenzo Monument 18, which was carved over two thousand years before the Vienna was painted. The concept of a sky-bearing axe, still present among the early colonial Mixtee, seems to have had its origins in Formative Olmec religion. The transformation of the Olmec Maize God: later maize gods of southeastern Mesoamerica It has been noted that a great deal of maize symbolism and iconography associated with the Olmec Maize God continued with later Mesoamerican peoples. This continuity appears not only in the secondary associations of this being but also in the physical attributes and qualities of the deity itself. According to Miguel Covarrubias (1946; 1957), the rain gods of Classic and Postclassic Mesoamerica derived from an Olmec prototype, a theory which has recently received some support (Taube 1995). In a similar vein, later maize deities known for the Zapotee, Isthmian, and Maya cultures owe much of their origins to the Olmec Maize God. 8. In more elaborate versions of belt assemblages, the triple celts occur in four groups around the body, thereby delineating the ruler as the central place (for example, fig. 15b-c). 9. The three shining fruits probably also allude to the lifting of the three precious stones of creation symbolizing centrality and the hearth (see Freidel et al. 1993; Taube n.d.).</page><page sequence="17">Taube: The Olmec Maize God 55 The Zapotee Kent Reilly (1994:191) compares the bifurcated headdress of the Olmec Maize God on the left arm of "Slim" to a similar example appearing in the Early Classic murals of Tomb 104 at Monte Alban (fig. 17a-b). Both headdresses have a central beadlike element flanked by down-sloping bands. On closer inspection, it is apparent that the Tomb 104 figure is essentially a personified form of the maize sign, Glyph J (see figs. 4d, 7g, 17c). Like the earlier Olmec Maize God, this figure occupying the position of the cob has eyes slanting upwards at the outer corners and an Olmecoid pouting upper lip exposing prominent incisors. Directly above this figure, there is the Zapotee sky sign the "jaws of the sky," suggesting that like the Olmec and later Classic Maya, this maize figure constitutes the world axis lifting the sky. An Early Classic vessel discovered in System M at Monte Alban portrays another personified Glyph J, here with outstretched arms holding probable maize plants (fig. b d Figure 12.

Caso and Bernai (1952:59) note that the device immediately above this personified maize cob is a sky element containing two "star eyes." Thus like the Tomb 104 mural, this vessel seems to depict maize as the world axis lifting the sky. In this regard, it should also be noted that the brow element of the ?poca de Transici?n maize deity is an early vertical version of the "jaws of the sky" motif (figs. 11 a, 1 7d). The personified Glyph J in Tomb 104 appears on the back wall of the chamber occupying the central, pivotal portion of the Tomb 104 murals. However, the tomb contains an even clearer reference to the maize god as the world axis. At the feet of the deceased, on the central axis of the tomb, a large urn was placed between four smaller urns of identical form and size (Caso 1938:fig. 101). Caso notes that the central urn represents Pitao Cozobi, the Zapotee Maize God (ibid., 82). With the central maize deity and four accompanying urns, this group is notably similar to the scenes of the Olmec Maize God surrounded by the four</page><page sequence="19">Taube: The Olmec Maize God 57 celts (fig. 6d-f). Like the backing central mural, the urns depict the Zapotee Maize God as the pivotal axis mundi. In Classic Zapotee burials, identical urns of the Zapotee Maize God can occur in groups of five, probably once again alluding to the four directions and center (see Caso and Bernai 1952:figs. 152, 154). Among the Classic Zapotee, the maize deity appears either with a fully human face, or more frequently, with a serpent-lipped buccal mask, as in the case of the Tomb 104 urn (fig. 23). It would appear that the anthropomorphic form is of considerable antiquity and mention has been made of an ?poca de Transici?n example (figs. 11a, 17d). However, some of the earliest urns known for the Zapotee?corresponding to Monte Alban I?depict the same god (fig. 17e). With little justification, aside from the fact that they may have functioned as braziers, Caso and Bernai (ibid., 326) identify these vessels as youthful versions of the old fire god, Huehueteotl. As Caso and Bernai (ibid., 330) point out, the urns typically display an Olmec-like upper lip pulled back to display the incisors, a convention recalling the Tomb 104 mural as well as the Olmec Maize God. In one case, the figure bares serpentlike fangs recalling a fine jadeite plaque of the Olmec Maize God attributed to Oaxaca (fig. 17f; see Bernai 1969:pl. 71, center). According to John Scott (1977; 1978:17) the Monte Alban I urns represent the youthful Zapotee Maize God; he also notes that a maize sign typically appears in the center of the headband. Although in most instances this is a trefoil element formed by a diagonally banded mature cob flanked by leaves, one example has a celtiform maize cob lashed sideways to the headband (see Bernai 1969:pl. 71, right). The trefoil element, resembling a fleur-de-lis, is virtually identical to the Late Preclassic Maya trefoil Jester God, which Fields (1991) identifies as a maize sign. Rather than youthful fire gods, the urn figures are early versions of the Zapotee Maize God. Despite that fact that these urns were fashioned well after the Olmec demise, they are perhaps the most striking examples of Olmec influenced art from Oaxaca. It would appear that for the Late Formative Zapotee, the face of corn was Olmec. The isthmus James Porter (1996) compares the aforementioned celtiform stelae at La Venta to Tres Zapotes Stela C, a Late Preclassic monument bearing a Long Count date corresponding to 31 B.c. (fig. 18a-b). He notes that the upper portion of Stela C is beveled much like the blade of a celt. Although making no assertions as to the identity of this being, Porter notes that the figure is strikingly similar to La Venta Monuments 25/6, 27, 58, and 66. Among the shared traits that Porter cites are the frontal face with buccal "mask," cheekbands, rectilinear ear ornaments, headband with central medallion, and a tabbed or U-shaped element above the eyes, essentially the double-merlon Olmec sign for green. Tres Zapotes Stela C can be identified as a Late Preclassic Isthmian version of the Olmec Maize God. In addition to the shared traits mentioned by Porter, the figure has eyes turning upwards at the outer corners and prominent upper incisors, common features of the Olmec Maize God. The curiously bifurcated brow probably refers to the enclosing bracts with the upper head and topping "hair" alluding to the actual cob and capping silk. The bifurcated brow element resembles a maize sign incised on a Middle or Late Formative Olmecoid stone figure in the Saint Louis Art Museum (fig. 18c). In this case, the cob is rendered as a vertical stick or celtlike object in the center of the bifurcated husk. A version of this maize motif appears on a Late Preclassic monument from La Lagunita, Guatemala (fig. 18d). In addition, it also appears as a Jester God brow piece on La Mojarra Stela 1, an Isthmian monument bearing two Long Count dates corresponding to the mid-second century A.D. (fig. 18e). As has been previously mentioned, Fields (1991) provides a compelling case that the Late Preclassic and Classic trefoil Jester God represents corn. Along with the central vertical cob and bifurcated husk, the La Mojarra example also has the double-merlon green sign on its brow, a convention seen for the Tres Zapotes figure as well as numerous examples of the Olmec Maize God (figs. 2b, d-e, 18b, e). In addition, the La Mojarra Jester God has the same triangle-and-dot cheek markings appearing on Tres Zapotes Stela C. Although slightly later, the La Mojarra example can be regarded as a profile representation of the Tres Zapotes figure, a Late Preclassic Isthmian Maize God. Fernando Winfield Capitaine (1988:22) compares the La Mojarra Jester God to the long-lipped zoomorphic head from Bone 3 of Tomb 1 at Chiapa de Corzo (fig. 18f). Like the La Mojarra example, the Chiapa de Corzo head is bifurcated, with the central vertical element denoting the cob. In addition, it appears that the double-merlon sign is incised both on the upper brow as well as on the feather bundle placed next to the erect cob. Agrinier (1960:16, 19) notes that this figure is clearly related to the profile head appearing on the accompanying Bone 1 scene (fig. 18g).

Like the Isthmian and Olmec corn deities, there was a similar Classic Maya distinction between tender, growing corn and mature maize (Taube 1992:46). Both the La Mojarra and Chiapa de Corzo Maize Gods are placed in U-shaped brackets with a bifurcated upper rim (fig. 18e-g). An earlier form of this device flanks the head of an Olmec Maize God appearing on a jadeite celt from La Venta (fig. 3a). The face on versions flanking the corn deity faces on La Venta Monuments 25/6 and 27a can be readily compared to the aforementioned bifurcated foliation flanking the sides of Olmec maize cobs, all serving to label the entire head as the maize ear (figs. 3c, 13b-c, 18a). The proto-Classic Isthmian Maize God also occurs as a distinct hieroglyphic sign in the La Mojarra writing system, appearing under the categories of signs 179 and 180 in the Macri and Stark catalog (1993:33-34) (fig. 18h-k). Although Macri and Stark (ibid., 34) regard the example from the Tuxtla Statuette as a distinct sign, Motif 180, it has virtually the same characteristics as the three examples from La Mojarra Stela 1. Like the Jester God on La Mojarra Stela 1, the face is rendered with a long upper lip, prominent incisors, and a beard. The cranial hair is split into two outcurving clumps, recalling the La Mojarra Jester God and Tres Zapotes Stela C, as well as depictions of the Olmec Maize God (see figs. 2d-e, 18b-e). In one example, a long hank of hair hangs before the face, a feature also found with other forms of the Isthmian Maize God and numerous Early Classic examples of the Maya Maize God (figs. 19a, c-d, 20i-m). In these epigraphic examples of the Isthmian Maize God, the outer corner of the eye has a tendency to slant upward, much like the Tres Zapotes Stela C example and the earlier Olmec Maize God. The Isthmian Maize God continues well into the Classic period. An unprovenanced stela portrays a probable Early Classic example of this being, again with the framing vegetal bracket around the head (fig. 19a). Like forms of the Zapotee Maize God, he displays a buccal serpent mask and a simple trefoil Jester God on his brow. The crook of his right arm holds a sinuous element, quite possibly referring to the feathered serpent or a tender stalk of green corn. In a detailed analysis of Classic period Rio Blanco ceramic vessels, Hasso Von Winning and Nelly Guti?rrez Solana (1993:chap. 4) note that this stela figure is identical to that appearing on Chiapa de Corzo Bone 1, an entity defined by its long buccal mask or lip (see fig. 18g). They also note that this long-lipped figure also appears on Classic Rio Blanco vessels as well as on Early Classic monuments from Cerro de las Mesas (fig. 19c-d). Although the authors (ibid., 47) identify the buccal mask as an attribute of the rain god, the Gulf Coast version of Tlaloc typically has a sharply upturning and outwardly curving upper lip as well as large canines (see Taube 1986:55-56). Rather than representing the rain deity, this being constitutes the Classic version of the Isthmian Maize God. Along with the buccal mask, projecting incisors, and frontal shank of hair, the Isthmian Maize God appearing on Classic Rio Blanco vessels can also have vegetation growing out of the mouth, a convention also known for the Olmec Maize God (see Joralemon 1971 :figs. 170-171 ). The Maya Maize God For the ancient Maya, the Maize God is well represented in both the Classic and Postclassic periods, and the evolution of the Maya Maize God can now be readily traced for over a thousand years from the Early Classic period to the Postclassic codices (see Taube 1985; 1992:41-50). The Early Classic form tends to be bearded with a long lock of hair falling before the face, recalling the examples of the Isthmian Maize God (fig. 20i-m). In addition, I have noted that the Early Classic Maize God has a long "Olmecoid" upper lip and projecting upper incisors (Taube 1992:48). Of course, both of these features are also found with both the Olmec and Isthmian Maize Gods. In addition, the Early Classic Maya Maize God tends to have narrow eyes that slant upward at the outer corners, another common feature of the Olmec and later Isthmian Maize God. It is quite probable that, like the Isthmian Maize God, the features of the Early Classic Maya Maize God ultimately derive from the Olmec god of corn. For the Late Preclassic period, the Maya Maize God commonly appears as the Jester God worn on the brow of Maya kings (fig. 20b-d). In many cases, the head of the deity appears in the same foliated bracket appearing with the Isthmian Maize God (fig. 20a, c-d). According to Virginia Fields (1991), the trefoil Jester God represents growing corn and can be readily compared to maize elements commonly appearing in the central portion of Olmec period headbands. The trefoil brow piece worn by the early Zapotee Maize God lends direct support for the maize identity of the three-pointed Jester God, as it is clearly a diagonally marked cob flanked by outcurving leaves (fig. 17e). In a similar vein as Fields, Richard Hansen (1992:143-145) notes that a Jester God</page><page sequence="22">60 RES 29/30 SPRING/AUTUMN 1996 appearing on Nakbe Stela 1 is a Preclassic version of the Maya Maize God (fig. 20b). Hansen (1995) compares this example to the pair of downwardly facing heads on the stucco cornice of Structure H-sub 2 at Late Preclassic Uaxactun (fig. 20e). Like Early Classic forms, the Late Preclassic Maya corn deity also tends to display a beard and a long, upturned lip exposing prominent incisors. The Late Preclassic Maya Maize God is not limited to isolated heads and inanimate items of jewelry. Whereas one of the two full figures between the two downwardly facing Maize God heads on Uaxactun Structure H-sub 2 appears to be Chac, the other figure can be identified as the bearded Maize God, complete with a long lock of beaded hair hanging before the face (fig. 20f ). In a number of Late Preclassic scenes, the Maya Maize God appears in probable episodes of sacred narrative. The aforementioned Kaminaljuyu Stela 19 figure displays the long lip, large pointed tooth, and prominent beard found with early forms of the Isthmian and Maya Maize a b Figure 15.

In addition, the figure has the same backward-turning cranial form appearing with the Isthmian Maize God on Chiapa de Corzo Bone 1, although in this case marked with a probable shining celt (fig. 18g). The Kaminaljuyu figure raises a serpent marked with clouds and an inverted Chac head above his head recalling the Early Classic Tikal scene of the Maya Maize God lifting the celestial serpent (see Freidel et al. 1993:73). Kaminaljuyu Stela 19 and the closely related Stela 4 may well represent Late Preclassic versions of the Maize God as the world axis supporting the heavens.</page><page sequence="24">62 RES 29/30 SPRING/AUTUMN 1996 At Late Preclassic Izapa, there are several probable examples of the Maya Maize God engaged in mythological episodes. On Izapa Stela 11, a long-lipped and possibly bearded figure emerges from a probable toad squatting in a pool of water (fig. 21a). Three leafy appendages hang from the mouth recalling the oral foliation often found with the Olmec and later Isthmian corn deities (figs. 18a-b, 19d). With his arms outstretched at right angles to his body, this figure may well depict the emergence of the Maya Maize God as the axis mundi. In later Maya scenes illustrating the resurrection of the Maize God, he can appear in a similar crosslike position, quite possibly as the world tree (see Seler 1902-1923:5:317; Robicsek and Hales 1981:fig. 58a). Izapa Stela 67 depicts another example of the long-lipped and bearded figure with outstretched arms (fig. 21b). In this case, he grasps a pair of scepters, recalling the maize scepters held by the Olmec Maize Gods from Teopantecuanitlan and the personified Glyph J from Monte Alban (figs. 17c, 27c). Riding in a canoe, the figure is surrounded by a large crenelated cartouche, a probable early form of the crenelated shell yax sign known for the proto-Classic and Early Classic Maya. Denoting the color green, this sign often encloses Early Classic celtiform god-markings (see Taube 1992:fig. 35a). The sinuous, ropelike elements surrounding the canoe occur as twisted serpents in the canoe scene appearing on Izapa Stela 22 (fig. 21c). Although the face of the central figure is entirely eroded, the similarity of this scene to Stela 67 suggests that both depict a well-known theme in Classic Maya art, the Maize God riding in a canoe (see Taube 1985).10 The tentative identification of the travels and resurrection of the Maya Maize God in Late Preclassic iconography provides intriguing insights into the origins of Classic Maya mythology. However, it is possible that some of these episodes were even present among the Middle Formative Olmec. Mention has been made of Reilly's (1994) identification of the Olmec Maize God as the world tree raising the heavens, a role also known for the Maize God in Classic Maya creation mythology (Freidel et al. 1993; Taube n.d.). Among the most striking items from the remarkable jade cache at Cerro de las Mesas is a jadeite canoe marked with a pair of faces at the ends (fig. 22a). With their cleft heads and slanted eyes, these faces can be identified as the Olmec Maize God recalling Classic Maya scenes of the corn deity traveling in a canoe.11 A jadeite sculpture formerly in the collection of Miguel Covarruvias represents the Olmec Maize God seated in a canoe quite like the example from Cerro de las Mesas (fig. 22b). A jadeite pectoral recently discovered at La Encrucijada, Tabasco, provides still more compelling evidence for the Olmec origins of some Classic Maya maize mythology. The pectoral bears the face of the infant aspect of the Olmec Maize God, or God IV, sprouting an ear of corn (fig. 22c). The backing oval form of the pectoral is marked by a pair of fine, curving, Y-like designs and two broad grooves running parallel to the narrow curving ends. This oval form depicts the underside of a turtle shell, with the deep grooves illustrating the two openings and the fine lines illustrating the plastron sutures. Along with the canoe journey, the emergence out of the turtle shell is among the most important mythological themes found with the Classic Maya Maize God. Although the turtle shell episode of the Maize God is not documented for the later contact period, colonial, or contemporary Maya, contemporary versions do exist in the former Olmec heartland region of Veracruz. In a Sierra Totonac myth of the Maize God recorded by Ichon (1973:74-75), the deity is born from a grain of green corn sprouting on the back of a turtle. A related Popoluca myth describes the young corn god crossing the ocean on the back of a turtle (Foster 1945:193). It would appear that certain mythology as well as iconography of the Classic Maya and later corn gods derives from Formative Olmec traditions. Agricultural surplus, wealth, and the Olmec economy Rather than developing from entirely different sources, the Classic corn deities known for the Zapotee, Maya, and Isthmian areas all appear to be "genetically" related to the Formative Olmec Maize God. It is thus possible to create a chart illustrating the development of later Maize Gods of southeastern Mesoamerica out of an Olmec prototype (fig. 23). Of course, such a diagram is strongly evocative of the oft-reproduced chart by 10. According to Freidel, Schele, and Parker (1993:94-99, 105), the Classic Maya Maize God was transported by canoe to Na Ho Chan, the place of resurrection and creation. As these authors note, Na Ho Chan is marked by twisted serpentine chords immediately recalling the canoe scenes on Izapa Stelae 22 and 67. 11. Among the contents of Offering 3 from Group A at La Venta were five rock crystal pendants carved in the form of turtle shells, four jadeite canoe effigy pendants, and a jadeite long-beaked water bird (Drucker et al. 1959:148-150, pis. 27-28). All three of these motifs? the canoe, turtle shell, and long-beaked water bird?are major themes in the journey and resurrection of the Classic Maya Maize God.</page><page sequence="25">Taube: The Olmec Maize God 63 Figure 17.

The continuity of Olmec maize and rain iconography in later Mesoamerican cultures is by no means a coincidental accident of history. As a response to a developing surplus economy, the Olmec actively and intentionally exported an elaborate subsistence ideology into other regions of Formative Mesoamerica. In so doing, the Olmec were able to ensure the participation of foreign groups in the Olmec economic network. Although it is generally recognized that domestic maize originated in the arid highlands of Mexico, Zea mays was present in the tropical lowlands by the Early Formative period. Rust and Leyden (1994:187) note that macrobotanical remains of cobs are present in the La Venta region by the beginning of the Early Formative. In the neighboring Soconosco region of south coastal Chiapas, maize is well documented in pre-Olmec, Locona phase sites (Blake et al. 1992:89; Clark and Blake 1994:28).

The analysis of human bone collagen samples from the Soconosco region indicates that corn does not appear to be a major dietary component until around 850 B.c., that is, during the Middle Formative period (Blake et al. 1992:90-91). Similarly, Rust and Leyden (1994:181) suggest that although maize was present in the La Venta region by the beginnings of the Early Formative period, it was not a principal staple until the Middle Formative period, especially during the apogee of La Venta. The apparently minor importance of maize in the Early Formative lowland diet raises interesting questions regarding the role of corn among the Olmec of Early Formative San Lorenzo. However, it is important to distinguish between the dietary, cultural, and economic roles of this food. In a cross-cultural discussion of maize</page><page sequence="30">68 RES 29/30 SPRING/AUTUMN 1996 in the pre-Hispanic New World, Hastorf and Johannessen (1994:436) note that "corn appears to have had a special significance in many cases before it became a staple, thus indicating that its unique cultural importance did not stem primarily from any dietary prominence." Moreover, the storage capabilities of dried maize, particularly when smoked, must have made it an especially attractive tribute food even in Early Formative times. As a readily stored item, maize would have obvious advantages over abundant but difficult to preserve aquatic fauna. Iconography from San Lorenzo and contemporaneous sites indicates that much of the complex maize symbolism known for the Olmec originated during the Early Formative period. At San Lorenzo, monumental sculptures suggest that the Olmec were already concerned with the symbolism of maize and agricultural fertility. Mention has been made of San Lorenzo Monument 52, which may represent an infant or seed aspect of the Olmec Maize God (see Coe and Diehl 1980:fig. 494). Another San Lorenzo sculpture, Monument 30, depicts a profile representation of the Olmec Maize God as God VI, probably a personified aspect of growing corn (fig. 24a). Along with the typical mouth of the Olmec Maize God, the figure has the backward-sweeping cleft head and a series of dots on his sinuous, serpentine body, quite probably the same seedlike elements frequently flanking the face of this being. It is also clear that celts had a major symbolic role at San Lorenzo. In addition to the aforementioned throne depicting celt-wielding dwarfs (fig. 14b-c), Monument 8 bears the carefully carved outlines of six celts on its upper surface (Coe and Diehl 1980:313). However, like the widespread occurrence of grinding stones at San Lorenzo (ibid., 213-231), it is difficult to determine whether this Early Formative celt iconography is specifically associated with maize. Instead, as in the case of the beautifully worked celts of Neolithic Europe, these stone axes could be identified with more general activities of agriculture and field preparation. The same concern could also be raised for the deities represented on San Lorenzo Monuments 30 and 52. Since neither figure displays overt maize imagery, it could be argued that they embody not simply corn but rather generalized concepts of agricultural fertility. Despite its heavily battered condition, San Lorenzo Monument 26 provides one of the strongest indications of corn symbolism and ritual among the Early Formative Olmec (fig. 24b). The seated figure holds two objects commonly paired in later Middle Formative Olmec iconography, the "knuckle-duster" and the so-called "torch." I (Taube 1995:89) recently suggested that the torch motif represents a bound bundle of precious feathers. The feather identification does appear to be correct, and in one instance a quetzal head replaces the capping feather tuft (fig. 25d). However, these items are not simply feather bundles but maize fetishes. Quite commonly, a maize ear projects out of the feathers quite like a cob emerging from the enclosing husk (fig. 24c-d, f). Moreover, in a number of cases, the feather tufted end is simply replaced with the head of the Olmec Maize God (fig. 24e). Feathered maize-ear fetishes are among the most revered and precious items of Pueblo peoples of the American Southwest. Known as mili among the Zuni, tiponi among the Hopi, and iariko among the Keresan speakers of Sia, these sacred items are formed of long plumes of the Mesoamerican macaw and other precious feathers placed against a perfect ear of corn with the cob and lower portion of the feathers held by cotton thread, bound sticks, or basketry (Geertz 1987:17-18; Stevenson 1894:40-41; Stevensonl 904:417-420). These maize fetishes, particularly the Sia examples, are strikingly similar to the Formative Olmec "torch" motif (fig. 24g-h). Feathered corn fetishes are well documented in the archaeological record and commonly appear in protohistoric Pueblo IV murals (fig. 24i-j).12 An actual example of a maize-ear fetish dating to late Pueblo III (ca. a.D. 1200-1300) was supplied with macaw feathers, pieces of turquoise, and a finely worked hematite cylinder, items denoting its precious as well as sacred quality (Hall and Dennis 1986:125, fig. 47). The San Lorenzo monument suggests that such feathered ear fetishes, still widely used by Puebloan peoples to this day, may have had their origins among the Early Formative Olmec. It will be seen that portrayals of these fetishes are extremely widespread in Mesoamerica during the Middle Formative period and appear on Olmec-style monuments ranging from El Salvador to Guerrero, Mexico, a distance of over 1,000 kilometers. Although the Mesoamerican feathered maize-ear fetishes are especially common in Olmec iconography, probable versions also appear in Early Formative highland Mexico. A ceramic vessel attributed to Caballo Pintado, Puebla, portrays a maize ear atop an 12. The Pueblo IV representations of maize fetishes are very similar to the feathered item worn on the brow of the Isthmian Maize God from Chiapa de Corzo Bone 3 (see fig. 19f). Occurring on the corn deity, the object may be a Late Preclassic version of the feathered maize fetish. As in the case of the Olmec examples, it is also supplied with the double-merlon sign.</page><page sequence="31">Taube: The Olmec Maize God 69 a ?Jl| _ b Figure 22.

An Early Formative Olmec style vessel from San Jose Mogote, Oaxaca, portrays two erect maize cobs, one topped by the trefoil maize sign (fig. 25b-c). With their diagonal banding and series of dots, these cobs are strikingly similar to forms two and three of the aforementioned Dumbarton Oaks four-celt headband (fig. 7a). In addition, the better preserved of the two Early Formative examples displays a lanceolate form near its base, immediately recalling the cob outline appearing on the third celt of the Dumbarton Oaks headband (figs. 25b, 7a). The dots on this particular example appear to sprout foliation, suggesting that the dotted elements found on God VI do represent seeds. The San Jose Mogote bowl probably constitutes an Early Formative Olmec cosmogram. The two cobs are interspersed by stylized representations of the Olmec Dragon, an entity interpreted as a sky serpent by a number of researchers (for example, Flannery and Marcus 1994:136; Pyne 1976:273; Taube 1995). Much like the diagonally banded cob of Chalcatzingo Monument 21, the vertical cobs may represent the axis mundi supporting the heavens.

Although fragmentary, the bowl seems to have also depicted axis mundis flanked by Olmec Dragon sky serpents. In this case the vertical cobs are replaced with the cleft head of the Olmec Maize God. In both of these early Olmec style vessels, corn is portrayed as the axis mundi projecting into the overarching heavens.13 The vast expenditure involved in the creation of monumental sculpture at San Lorenzo indicates that by the Early Formative period, the Olmec elite controlled an extensive social surplus obtained through forms of taxation and tribute. Although it remains uncertain whether maize was an important item in the Early Formative Olmec surplus economy, it surely was by Middle Formative times when maize constituted a major staple of the local diet. In the humid Olmec heartland, a major food surplus, even in the form of maize, must have created problems of transportation and storage. D'Altroy and Earle (1985) describe the transformation of the Inca economy from a system based on maize and other staples to one incorporating items of wealth, such as shell beads, fine cloth, and metals. The increasing importance of jadeite, precious feathers, and other exotic goods among the Middle Formative Olmec probably reflects a similar transition from a staple finance to one of wealth using rare materials that are more readily transported, stored, and converted. It is especially intriguing that two of the wealth items chosen?jadeite and quetzal plumes?were symbolically equated with maize among the Middle Formative Olmec and later peoples of Mesoamerica.14 Following the original insights of Joralemon (1988:38), it has been noted that jadeite celts were widely identified with maize ears among the Middle Formative Olmec. The Olmec also compared quetzal feathers to green maize, and it is likely that the Olmec feathered corn fetishes were sheathed in "husks" of verdant quetzal plumes (fig. 24).15 Moreover, in Olmec iconography, maize silk can be rendered as long, undulating plumes, as if the cob were tipped with precious feathers (figs. 1, 26a-b). This same convention occurs with maize ears portrayed in Classic Maya art (fig. 4h). Feathered maize ears are often held by the backrack figures carried by the Holmul Dancer, a Classic Maya form of the Maize God richly dressed in jade and quetzal plumes. Much like individuals offering tribute, the backrack figures present foliated heads of the Maize God tipped with long quetzal plumes (see Houston et al. 1992:fig. 4). In these scenes, feather bundles and jade beads can also substitute for the personified cob (ibid., fig. 4d-e). Jadeite and quetzal plumes were also the most valued precious items among the Postclassic Aztec, who regarded them as symbolic forms of maize and agricultural abundance. Thus in the Codex Chimalpopoca, green corn husks and rain constitute the "real" quetzal plumes and jades of the rain gods, that is, the ultimate sources of surplus and wealth. Because theToltec ruler Huemac did not grasp this basic equation?agricultural abundance being equivalent to items of wealth?Tollan was destroyed by famine and drought (Bierhorst 1992:156-157). A major concern of the Olmec elite was the securing of rare, exotic goods, not simply as indicators of social rank but as easily manageable wealth. In order to obtain these valued materials, the Olmec participated in extensive networks of exchange with highland Mexico and the Maya region. It is noteworthy that much of the Middle Formative Olmec influence observed in both the Maya region and highland Mexico concerns maize and associated valuables. Quite often, Olmec ritual and iconography pertaining to maize occur at strategic areas associated with trade routes and the procurement of rare materials. Among the regions to be discussed are the Grijalva drainage basin and southern piedmont areas of the Maya and the highland Mexican sites of Chalcatzingo and Teopantecuanitlan. 13. An Early Formative multichambered vessel attributed to Tlapacoya portrays a human figure flanked by a pair of Avian Serpent heads. The figure holds two staffs in his outstretched arms, recalling both the Olmec maize fetishes and a pose found with the Olmec Maize God. Unfortunately, due to the angle of the photograph, it is impossible to discern whether this figure is in fact the Olmec Maize God (see Feuchtwanger 1989:pl. 143). It is possible that four circular chambers found on this vessel were to hold four vertical ears of corn, in other words, maize fetishes. 14. Although the economic role of cacao remains poorly known among the Olmec, cacao clearly was an important rare commodity for the Classic Maya and later peoples of Mesoamerica. Like jade and quetzal plumes, cacao was also symbolically equated with maize among the Classic Maya. In a number of scenes, the Maya Maize God is shown as the personification of the cacao tree (see Coe 1975:vessel 2; Taube 1985:fig. 4c). For the Maya, the source of comparison is not the verdant quality of the plant but rather the shape and seed arrangement of its pod, which closely resembles a maize ear. Moreover, just as the Maya commoner drank such ground maize drinks as pozole and atole, the Maya elite drank cacao, the gruel of kings. It is probably for this reason that the Classic Maya Maize God is so commonly found on Classic Maya cacao vases. 15. The identification of maize with quetzal plumes and jade also appears on page 53 of the Codex Borgia. In the scene, the axis mundi is portrayed as a maize plant marked with jade jewel signs and topped by a quetzal bird.</page><page sequence="34">72 RES 29/30 SPRING/AUTUMN 1996 Figure 24.

In the Maya region, Olmec-style celt caches and burial offerings of jade and other materials are known from the Grijalva basin, Seibal, and Copan (see Fash 1991:67-71; Lowe 1981:242-252; Smith 1982:243). The discovery of jade celts and other Olmec style artifacts at Copan is especially noteworthy as this site is in close vicinity to the Motagua jade source. In all three cases, the celts display strong directional orientation recalling celt caches at La Venta and the positioning of celts around the Olmec Maize God (fig. 2c-e). In view of the elaborate identification of greenstone celts with maize ears, the burial of these precious items could be regarded as an Olmec form of agricultural ritual.16 Along with the burial of greenstone celts, Middle Formative representations of the Olmec Maize God and corn iconography are widespread in the southern Maya 16. It should be noted that for the Grijalva site of San Isidro, the great majority of celts were of roughly fashioned tuff rather than of precious jadeite. Nonetheless, an exceptionally large and finely worked greenstone celt was discovered atop a pavement of smaller celts (see Lowe 1981:248, fig. 12a).</page><page sequence="36">74 RES 29/30 SPRING/AUTUMN 1996 Figure 26.

A boulder sculpture from the piedmont site of Abaj Takalik portrays a bearded Olmec Maize God in dynamic pose with a plumed cob projecting out from the back of the head, a convention often found with the Formative corn deity (figs. 2e, 26a-b). The face of this being is notably similar to the Late Preclassic Isthmian Maize Gods appearing on Chiapa de Corzo Bones 1 and 2 (fig. 18f-g). The Shook Panel, another Middle Formative piedmont sculpture, portrays the Olmec Maize God wearing the foliated Jester God headpiece as well as a plumed cob at the back of the head (fig. 26b). The Olmec-style boulder sculpture from Chalchuapa, El Salvador, portrays three people holding maize-ear fetishes. Along with the projecting cob, they display the Olmec "double-merlon" sign for green, an element commonly found on the Olmec maize-ear fetishes (fig. 26c-d). Along with the southern piedmont area, the Olmec style relief at Xoc borders the native habitat of the quetzal, near a tributary leading to the Jatate and</page><page sequence="37">Taube: The Olmec Maize God 75 ultimately the Usumacinta rivers. This bas-relief carving portrays a striding supernatural figure wearing a vertical maize cob, or Motif 81, atop his head (fig. 26e). In his right arm, the figure holds the maize-ear fetish. His other arm grasps a large, paddlelike object. Susanna Ekholm-Miller (1973:13) identifies the four curving forms atop the item as silk-tasseled cobs affixed to a central corn stalk. The stalk is also topped with the trefoil maize sign, reaffirming the identity of this plant. Because of the cross-lashing, this object has been frequently interpreted as a bundle despite the fact that no bundles of this shape are known for ancient Mesoamerica. With its tabular form and rounded top, the object closely resembles a stela. The aforementioned La Venta stelae depicting the Olmec Maize god are of similar form and are also marked with cross-lashing (fig. 13b-c). Moreover, La Venta Monument 25/6 displays the same topping trefoil maize sign found with the Xoc example (fig. 13b). It appears that the Xoc figure is carrying essential items of Olmec maize ceremonialism: the corn fetish and a stela portraying maize iconography. Aside from the Maya region, Middle Formative Olmec-style monumental carving also occurs at the highland Mexican sites of Chalcatzingo, Morelos and Teopantecuanitlan, Guerrero, both of which occur on strategic trade routes (see Grove 1989; Hirth 1978). The famed bas-reliefs from Chalcatzingo are filled with allusions to maize, wealth, and agricultural fertility. Mention has been made of Chalcatzingo Monuments 13 and 21 that show scenes concerning maize as the world tree (figs. 7f, 8c). Another Chalcatzingo carving, Monument 12, depicts a flying figure holding the maize-ear fetish. He is accompanied by a pair of quetzals and a parrot, exotic birds prized for their precious feathers (fig. 27a). The Chalcatzingo relief designated as Monument 1 contains the most elaborate scene pertaining to riches and agricultural abundance (see Gay 1972:fig. 11). The scene depicts a woman seated within a zoomorphic cave in a setting of clouds, rain, and growing maize. Beaded raindrops appear on the headdress as well as falling from clouds on the woman's skirt (see ?ngulo 1987:fig. 10.8). Along with two maize plants on the brow and headdress, the figure also wears a pair of long-tailed quetzal birds. In addition to the representations of exotic birds, actual artifacts of precious jadeite and serpentine are known from the site including beads, earspools, celts, bloodletting awls, and statuettes (Thompson 1987). Although some 400 kilometers from the Olmec heartland, the recently discovered site of Teopantecuanitlan contains one of the most ambitious portrayals of Olmec maize iconography. Four elaborate representations of the Olmec Maize God holding pairs of the feathered maize fetishes appear on opposite sides of a sunken courtyard faced with travertine stone. Reilly (1994:226-227) notes that with their heads projecting above the courtyard, the outlines of the four travertine sculptures create the double-merlon motif on the eastern and western sides of the enclosure. The Olmec sign for green, the double-merlon motif commonly appears with the Olmec Maize God including on the previously mentioned green La Venta stelae (fig. 13b-c). Like the La Venta monuments, the Teopantecuanitlan sculptures also wear the four-celt headband marked with the central crossed band. However, the Guerrero monuments also display attributes of Gods IV and VI. Thus like the infant God II, the figures wear prominent crossed-band element pectorals, as well as a pair of crossed bands on the sides of the headband (fig. 27c). In profile, it can be seen that the four sculptures have the backward-sweeping, cleft head of God VI. It thus appears that the four Guerrero sculptures simultaneously embody several aspects of the Olmec Maize god. At the back of each of the four Teopantecuanitlan sculptures, facing out from the sunken patio, there are four stafflike forms all pierced by circular holes (fig. 27b). Although each element is slightly different, all portray vertical maize ears. The example with the best preserved upper portion clearly portrays the trefoil maize sign. Moreover, the examples on the eastern wall appear to be personified with the heads of the Olmec Maize God complete with cleft heads and in the case of the better-preserved example, the hanging nasal elements atop the lip. A pair of outcurving cleft elements flank the upper portions of the four ears, clearly a version of the U-shaped bracket foliation on the sides of maize ears in La Venta iconography (fig. 3c). It has been noted that this same cleft bracket flanks the frontal faces of the Olmec Maize Gods appearing on the La Venta stelae (fig. 13b-c). In other words, the two personified maize ears appearing on the eastern wall are essentially schematic forms of the Olmec Maize God appearing on the La Venta stelae. Although some five hundred kilometers distant, the maize iconography at Teopantecuanitlan is strikingly similar to that appearing at Middle Formative La Venta. The Middle Formative sites exhibiting Olmec maize iconography and ritual in the Maya region and highland Mexico are all strategically located on major trade routes or in areas of precious resources.

Teopantecuanitlan. After ibid., fig. 10. writing before the discovery of Teopantecuanitlan, Hirth (1978:12) notes that many of the cited Maya-area sites with Olmec sculpture and the highland Mexican site of Chalcatzingo could be considered as gateway communities serving as pivotal intermediaries in the extraction of valuable resources from the hinterlands. According to Grove (1989:146), the Middle Formative Olmec were actively concerned with securing elite goods from other regions of Mesoamerica: Around 900 B.c. a restructuring of the exchange networks seems to have begun, apparently in response to the increasing regional demands. As competition for imported elite resources reached a critical limit, the Gulf Coast centers apparently took steps to insure and enhance their supplies by establishing alliances with distribution centers having access to the desired resources. In the beginning such alliances may have been informal and became more formal as time and competition progressed. The scenario described by Grove is very similar to the concept of core outposts discussed by Algaze (1993) for ancient developing states including Uruk-period Mesopotamia. Created to secure rare and essential commodities, such outposts tend to be located on strategic routes in foreign polities outside of direct political control. Even with state level societies, the distant nature of these outposts mitigated against direct physical coercion. Instead, Algaze (ibid., 320-321) notes that local leaders appear to have participated voluntarily to consolidate their own political power as well as to secure exotic commodities. Much like the core-outpost model described by Algaze (1993) for incipient states, the Olmec ensured the participation of distant trade partners not through the impractical use of force but by persuasion, that is, by presenting the advantages of contact and exchange. To local leaders outside of the Olmec heartland, the immediate benefits could well have been in terms of increased power and wealth. However, the presence of Olmec ritual and monuments in distant areas indicates that ideology also played a powerful role. In contrast to the later iconography of Teotihuacan, Tula, and the Aztec, this ideology was not focused on warfare and military power but rather on the generation of agricultural abundance and wealth: themes of immediate interest to essentially all Formative societies. It is this cult of agriculture and associated riches that served to attract foreign peoples into the Olmec economic network. In both distant regions and the Olmec heartland, access to wealth and ultimately power was portrayed in terms of an elaborate religious complex pertaining to maize and agricultural fertility.</page><page sequence="39">Taube: The Olmec Maize God 77 BIBLIOGRAPHY Agrinier, Pierre 1960 The Carved Human Femurs from Tomb 1, Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas, Mexico.
