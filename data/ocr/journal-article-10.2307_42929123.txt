Tananarive: Université de Madagascar, 1970. 212 pp., 55 figs., 2 plates. Malgache Francs 500. Reviewed by Wilhelm g. solheim ii, University of Hawaii This is the third number of Taloha to appear. The first, on the origins of the Malgaches, I reviewed in AP IX (p. 174). The second was on the Islamisés. This number has three general subjects: the archaeology of the mountainous interior of Madagascar, the archaeology of eastern Africa (two brief papers), and physical and cultural anthropology in Madagascar. All of the archaeological sites covered from interior Madagascar are relatively recent fortified sites, a number of them in use well into the last century. Much of the information presented comes from historical records, and no excavation is reported. Pottery and potsherds from several of the sites are briefly described, and line drawings of many are included. The decoration and forms continually remind me of the Sa- huýnh-Kalanay pottery of Southeast Asia. It will be most interesting when sites occupied during the first millennium A.D. are found and excavated. The paper by Neville Chittick (one page) on "Récentes recherches sur la côte orientale de I* Afrique" is the only one in English. He reports that a few pieces of 9th and 10th century Chinese porcelain have been found at Manda, north of Kilwa and Lamu, the earliest yet found in eastern Africa. This site had close relations with the Persian Gulf. The second paper on eastern Africa presents archaeological remnants on Cap Delgado and the island of Quisiva in Mozam- bique (pp. 155-164). These are primarily architectural remains of relatively late date. The first physical anthropology paper is on the history of research in this subject in Madagascar, while the second is a brief report on blood-group research. A paper in Malagasy is on the funeral customs of the Kajemby. This</page><page sequence="2">76 Asian Perspectives, xvii(i), 1974 is followed by papers on Nosy-be canoes, Malgache beads of the 19th and 20th centuries, and the final paper, a comparison of the use of symbolized anthropomorphic design by the Malgache and Oceanians. The approach being taken in Malagasy archaeology in working on historic sites or sites of known inhabitants is a wise policy to follow as long as development is not endangering any of the earlier sites. This will help to untangle recent relationships and movements of peoples within Madagascar. It will tell us little more than we already know about the first arrivals and when and whence they came. As a Southeast Asian specialist, I am very curious about the circum- stances of the first settlement from Southeast Asia and look forward with great anticipation to the location and excavation of early sites.</page></plain_text>
