This is the fifth volume in a series dealing with fungi as experimental systems, with emphasis on the applied. The editors remind us that fungi and plants are two vast assemblages involved in a multitude of associations. Consequently, they chose examples selectively with the aim at drawing general conclusions especially of factors that regulate plant-fungus interactions. The volume is intended for a wide readership among professional biologists, and should be of much interest to readers of New Phytologist. The two parts, A and B, contain 12 and 16 chapters respectively, are compact, expensively produced and attractively bound. The contributing authorities are predominantly American and non-English- speaking Europeans. The latter often show how complex technical data can be presented in a lucid and interesting way. The chapters tend to be reviews of the reviewer's reviews and vary in scholarship. The emphasis is on the experimental results, with little room left for innovative thought. The organization of the text is laid down clearly and logically. Part A deals with aspects of the initial contact of spore with plant and the initial responses to each other, with emphasis on metabolic interactions. Part B explores interactions from a broader perspective of ecology, geography and evolution. Useful summaries close each chapter. There is some inconsistency in the use of bold face for emphasis, labelling of figures and application of terms for sexual and asexual states of fungi. A progressively annoying trend in the opening chapters is the out-of-the- blue appearance of abbreviated binomials such as M. grisea or P. urticae that will leave readers guessing. The series editors have endowed Mycota generously but drew a line on formal recognition of conidial fungi and on inclusion of things that gulp food and run about naked. Yet 'Deuteromycota' and 'Deuteromycotina' appear as legit- imate taxa, and Plasmodiophora brassicae figures among 'Fungi producing auxins'. Chapters Al to 7 are plant pathology in increasingly molecular detail. External interactions comprise adap- tation of spores to adhere, and physico-chemical cues for spores to germinate. In the discussion of fungal invasion by appressoria, hyphopodia and infection cushions mycologists will look in vain for information on those most sophisticated of plant intruders: the tropical leaf asco- mycetes. Fungus- or plant-derived phytotoxins or elicitor chemicals act both as agents of disease and as signal molecules that mobilize plant defences. A number of proteins and wall-degrading enzymes have been identified and their genes cloned. They offer not only practical prospects for disease-resistant transgenic plants but also for understanding the basic molecular language between interacting organisms. A8 deals with host-specific toxins of Cochliobolus, parasitic on cereal crops. The sudden appearance in 1969 of a virulent strain of C. heterostrophus on Texas male-sterile cytoplasm corn caused a major epidemic in the USA and triggered concentrated research into the fundamental mechanisms of the interaction. Those not familiar with the details will find this detective story fascinating. Chapters A9 to 12 review fungal phytohormones in pathogenic and mutualistic associations, toxins in grass endophytes, metabolic interactions in lichens, and altered gene expression during ectomycorrhizal development. This section brings relief from the sometimes uncom- promising onslaught of molecular terminology, if only because genes and gene products have not yet been identified. This notwithstanding, novel morphologies and metabolites of the symbioses are assumed to result from the co-ordinated expression of both plant and fungal genes that are not expressed in partners individually. Chapters B1 to 5, 'Profiles in pathogenesis and mutu-</page><page sequence="2">762 Reviews alism', are again sketched by plant pathologists who focus on gene-for-gene interactions in Cladosporium fulvum - tomato, Phytophthora infestans - potato, Magnapothe grisea - rice, Erysiphe graminis - cereal grasses and the rust fungi on diverse hosts. Numerous races of M. grisea arise rapidly to circumvent man-induced resistance in rice cultivars. B2 is a fascinating account of the recent escalation of the late blight of potato following the introduction into the Old World of a complementary mating type from an endemic locus in central Mexico. In sharp contrast, the hitherto neglected 'academic' subjects of mycorrhizas (B6-7) and endophytes of trees (B8) are still awaiting adequate support to be launched into the molecular age. Chapters B9 to 12 focus on the consequences of fungal associations in plant populations, and range from a historical review of epidemiological aspects of plant pathogenic fungi in agroecosystems to population biology of Colletotrichum and grass endophytes. The title 'The Epidemiology of Mycorrhizal Fungal Infection During Succession', sounds unduly virulent in the light of later statements (B1i5) that most epidemics are caused by introduced pests and pathogens and that epidemics are rare between endemic plants and their pathogens, let alone their mutualists. However, although the title is new the story is not. The authors proclaim that the understanding of both plants and fungi as individuals is crucial to the understanding of the ecology of symbiosis but make no distinction between different kinds of mycorrhizal plants or fungi. Chapters B13 to 16 examine the evolution of fungus- plant association from a broader, more thought-provoking perspective. Natural populations of fungi generally have higher karyotype variability than fungi maintained in laboratory culture, which is often underestimated by conventional taxonomy. There is evidence of insertions, deletions and transpositions and, in clonal endophytes, of interspecific hybridization that may promote amelioration of virulence into mutualistic detente. B14 is a fine example of seeing both the forest and the trees. B16 is a deductive tour-de-force into resistance and susceptibility in plants, with insights into agricultural gene-for-gene phenomenon, which appears somewhat overemphasized. But I wonder if the pairwise host-parasite equation would so elegantly balance if one added 'real world' endophytes and mycorrhizas. Since the initial parting of plant pathology and mycology in the late XIX century, the relationship between mycologists and plant pathologists has seldom been one of mutual admiration. A move to mend the family feud, as attempted in this volume, is indeed commendable. Whether the editors hoped to achieve a seamless re- integration I am not sure. They knew what they were up against because 'practices and theories for agricultural systems have developed quite independently of other biological disciplines ... plant pathology has developed its own terminology and concepts that make communication with other biologists difficult.' (B15: pp. 239, 241). One is quickly struck with the phytopathologists' preoccupation with plant-fungus 'pairs', and by their spontaneous disregard of animals, e.g. in considering adhesion of fungal spores. No such detachment was possible in discussion of the functioning of natural partnerships with endophytes or in mycorrhizas. On one hand, the volume abounds in examples from plant pathology of evolution 'red in tooth and claw', i.e. arms race in its anthropomorphic sense. On the other, the range and scope of ecological advantages indufced in plants by mycorrhizal fungi and endophytes show clearly nature's more accommodating way towards aggressors. Here lies the sharp contrast of approach and technical advancement between expediency of feeding the masses and an ivory- tower pursuit of the quirks of nature. But who is in the ivory tower? Plant pathologists' one-dimensional breeding to improve yields often creates anomalous conditions that enhance virulence. The Cochliobolus T-toxin that acts on a mitochondrial gene of male-sterile T-corn, apparently unique in the biosphere, is the product of agriculture. Plant pathologists keep only just ahead of the pathogens, induced resistance is usually broken within five years, and many temporary gains may exact too high a price in environmental side-effects. It is not inconceivable that 'If more rigorous genetic analyses predict evolution towards less virulent pathogens and more resistant hosts, we may need to change our agricultural practices and breeding programs towards systems that allow coevolution between host and pathogen genotypes'. (B15: p. 245). At first glimpse of the title I said to myself, if there is a work in which the formal 'realm' Mycota should reflect hot-off-the-press data from molecular biology this is it. I was wrong. The series editors opted for ye olde 'hetero- geneous assemblage of eukaryotic micro-organisms' that happen to feed by absorption. This invites confusion. In some chapters, chromista and even protozoa are integrated with fungi. Others acknowledge the distinctness of oomycetes, pointing out that most lack introns, that the regulatory mechanisms involved in gene activation ap- parently 'are not conserved between fungi and Chromista' and that, like Phytophthora, have a completely different set of elicitor molecules from the pathogenic fungi (B2). However, B16 does not separate data from 'true fungi and oomycota ' ' even though... no longer considered to be closely related.' In apparent contradiction of points made in Chapter B2, it is argued that the similarity with which both groups interact with plants gives no reason to think that evolutionary principles derived from one group will differ from the other. Omycetes lack chitin and could gain entry opportunistically by circumventing chitinase-based defences. In this and other respects, oomycetes would bear comparison with leaf-intruding green algae. I grant that biotrophic protoctists account for some of plant pathology's greatest advances, but surely we now know enough about their distinctness from Mycota to break with the tradition and start comparing apples with apples.
