New Jersey State Museum Investigations No. 2, 1965: x + 159 pp., 2 pls., 15 figs., 12 tables. $2.50. This work represents a major contribution to our knowledge of the Scarlet Tanager, one of the most widely known American songbirds. The tanager's arboreal habits and perhaps a scarcity of numbers probably explain why, previous to Prescott's work, comparatively less was known about it than about other familiar passerines. The style in which this study is presented makes it quite readable, although it is perhaps uncritical and vaguely anthropomorphic in some cases. The book is well organized, and along with two fine</page><page sequence="2">328 THE WILSON BULLETIN September 1971 Vol. 83, No. 3 colorprints of young tanagers by George Miksch Sutton, it makes a neat, attractive volume. Most of the work was done in southern Michigan in 1947, 1948, and 1949. Males first arrive in early to mid-May and soon begin to sing from conspicuous perches in the tops of large trees. Females arrive several days later and, Prescott suggests, initially locate the males visually as the latter are easily seen on their tree top perches. After the females arrive, singing is no longer done from such high perches and its intensity decreases. To my mind, at least, this evidence raises the question of whether high visibility leading to a rapid acquirement of a mate is the primary selective pressure responsible for the spectacular plumage of the male Scarlet Tanager or whether some other factor such as a species isolating mechanism is more important. Nest construction is done entirely by the female although the male may influence her in the choice of site. Comprehensive descrip- tive data on the nest site are presented and indicate that nests are usually placed at openings in the forest. Incubation rhythm and the factors that influence it are dealt with at some length. Data on clutch size and/or success rate, are presented for only 17 nests. The small number of nests studied is, I feel, the major shortcoming of the entire study. Information on other important aspects of nesting, such as feeding the young and nest sanitation, is also pre- sented. General behavioral aspects including vocalizations and preening are described in varying detail. One significant point apparently unrecognized prior to this work is that most if not all female tanagers sing during the breeding season. The female's song is similar to the male's, and antiphonal singing occasionally occurs. A comprehensive section deals with other vertebrates found in the tanagers' territory and the interactions, if any, that Prescott observed. This study contains much significant information on parasitism by Brown-headed Cow- birds (Molothrus ater). Eleven of 14 (79 per cent) nests studied by Prescott contained cowbird eggs. Almost as many cowbirds (seven) fledged from successful nests with known contents as did tanagers (eight). The detrimental effects of cowbird parasitism are clear, and apparently are due largely to egg removal by adult cowbirds and/or decreased egg production by the female tanagers. Prescott suggests that if tanagers desert their nests in response to cowbird parasitism, this should be considered a detri- mental consequence. I believe it is more meaningful to consider nest desertion as an adaptive response to cowbird parasitism because it gives the birds an opportunity to undertake another and possibly unparasitized attempt at breeding. During his studies, Prescott was fortunate enough to witness a female cowbird in the act of parasitizing a nest. To my knowledge, this observation is unique in that the cowbird removed a tanager egg within seconds of depositing her own egg. Other workers (Hann, Wilson Bull., 53: 211-221, 1941 and Mayfield, The Kirtland's Warbler, Cranbrook Inst. Sci., Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, 1960) have found that host eggs are removed either the day before, several hours after, or the day after the cowbird egg is deposited. Occasional aspects of this work are marred by uncritical methods and deductions. The statements that the singing rate of the male falls off when the females arrive and that in general, singing rate is constant throughout the day would be more valuable if they were backed up with quantitative data. Prescott states that the cowbird is recognized as an enemy since tanagers usually attack female cowbirds which enter their territory. Yet instances of invading cowbirds not being attacked are noted, as are cases of attacks by the tanagers upon nonparasitic birds such as the Catbird (Dumetella carolinensis) and the Veery (Hylocichla juscescens). In an interesting section on predation of tanager</page><page sequence="3">Sepiember 1971 ORNITHOLOGICAL LITERATURE 329 Vol. 83, No. 3 nests by Common Crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) Prescott states that crows employ two different methods to hunt tanager nests. However, it is by no means certain that the activities Prescott observed the crows engaging in were designed to reveal the locations of nests. One of the most valuable assets of this work is the large number of interesting, anecdotal types of observations. Nest predation is a significant phenomenon yet is rarely witnessed. Prescott describes four instances in which he observed nests being preyed upon. The selective advantage of keeping females from copulating with other males is an often cited function of territorality. Prescott describes a relevant observation in which a strange male invaded a territory, copulated with the female, and then was chased off by the resident male as soon as the latter appeared on the scene. Probably most persons interested in avian breeding ecology and behavior will find specific observations such as these, which are of value to their own special interests. Thus, besides being a source of significant information on Scarlet Tanagers and Brown-headed Cowbirds, this study con- tains much additional material of value to ornithologists.-STEPHEN 1. ROTHSTEIN. THE RANDOM HoUSE BOOK OF BIRDS. By Elizabeth S. Austin and Oliver L. Austin, Jr. Illustrated by Richard E. Amundsen. Random House, 1970: 81/4 X 111/i in., 131 pp., many color paintings. $4.95. A pleasant family reference book, "Birds" is made up of alphabetically listed descrip- tions of birds (such as, in the D's, Dippers, Dodos, Domestic Birds), interspersed with a few general headings (for example: Feathers, Voice, Waterfowl). All the bird families of North America are included as are the most interesting or popular birds of the rest of the world. The illustrations, which unfortunately do not include all the species described in the text, are generally quite nice; there is, however, an extremely odd Great Blue Heron. A good deal of information, all carefully indexed, is available here to the grade four through junior high students, who will perhaps be the book's chief readers. This would be a good book for school libraries as well as for families.-SALLY LAUGHLIN.</page></plain_text>
