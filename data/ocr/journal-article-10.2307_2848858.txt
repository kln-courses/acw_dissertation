<plain_text><page sequence="1">A JOURNAL OF MEDIAEVAL STUDIES THE MIDDLE AGES - ROMANTIC OR RATIONALISTIC?1 BY J. S. P. TATLOCK IN the mediaeval tale incorporated in The Bridal of Triermain, Sir Walter Scott introduces his heroine with the words, Yet e'en in that romantic age, Ne'er were such charms by mortal seen. Speaking of what he calls the romanticism of wit in the sixteenth century, Irving Babbitt says, 'Though its origins are no doubt mediaeval, it differs from the ordinary romanticism of the Middle Ages to which I have already referred.' In his eminently readable English Literature from the Norman Conquest, the ever- regretted W. H. Schofield remarks, 'No literary productions of the Middle Ages are so characteristic . . . as those which treat romantically of heroes and heroines of bygone days.' Without pressing too curiously into the exact meaning of these authors, most people will accept their wording without protest or surprise. 'Me- diaeval romanticism,' 'the romantic Middle Ages,' are cliche's which enter our ears or run off our tongues or typewriters without themselves exciting much thought. Will it not aid a sound criticism to look more closely at what our im- pression of the romantic character of the Middle Ages consists in? I invite your attention for a little while, therefore, to The Middle Ages, Romantic or Ra- tionalistic? An early president of the Academy fought the idea of mediaeval uniformity and gloom; I attack a cheerier phantom. We shall regard chiefly the middle and later Middle Ages, from the eleventh century and the central current in the great countries of western Europe, the centuries and the countries whose creations still rouse our strongest admiration and still mould our civilization. The conditions of life from the sixth to the eleventh century, which were in es- sentials like frontier conditions, were then past. The spiritual climate was estab- lished, and the conditions which foretold the product. 'This timber is al redy up to frame.' Now, then, what is romanticism? A prolonged discussion would be likely to take us farther and farther into purely private psychology, and farther and farther from concrete historical fact. We shall perhaps agree that at bottom romanticism is nothing else than a taste, a taste for the strange, an enjoyment of surprise; that this taste is served by a license to the imagination and by emotion- alism, since emotion is the most freshly strange, unanalyzable part of our inner 1 Presidential address at the eighth annual meeting of the Mediaeval Academy of America, April 29, 1933. 295</page><page sequence="2">296 The Middle Ages - Romantic or Rationalistic? experience. A summary of romanticism as a taste for the strange, an uncontrolled imagination, and emotionalism, and of rationalism as a preference for reality and the practical, a reliance on reason, will suffice, that is, unless one is to enter into one of those nightmare dissections of romanticism, rationalism, classicism, real- ism, idealism, which God forbid, quod avertat Deus, Amen! One thing more. Rationalism is an acquired taste; a desire for the romantic is innate. To quote Irving Babbitt again, all children, almost all women, and the overwhelming ma- jority of men are, and always have been, romantics. While we remain human, we never wholly outgrow the taste in our moments of recreation, though when we become fully self-conscious we may repress and control it. The most austere of us critics and historians, when he turns on the green light by the bedside, may even resort to the most characteristic romance of our own day, the mystery- story. An age is not romantic, then, because it produces romance - all ages do; but only if its intellectual leaders cultivate and esteem the romantic. An age is rationalistic if its leaders resist romance, and when most original keep their eye on the actual and practical, and rely on reason. The words I am discussing have have been most domesticated in modern literary history. But no one will deny that throughout the ages the orthodox taste has varied from time to time, some- times fundamentally - the taste emerges out of a relish for change, which is formed by the leaders, and cultivated and imitated by the weaker, and taken for granted by most. Pope had his romantic hours, but his hours in his grotto and of writing Eloisa to Abelard had only the restrained and timid romanticism of the neo-classic. Such words are very far from summing up the whole truth about any writer, and have thrown much dust in the eyes. But it is useful to have labels for discriminating between Sidney and Dryden, Voltaire and Victor Hugo, and if they have been found useful for moderns, why not for mediaevals? A genuine student of the past will not attach importance to such cues for modern romantic thrills as castles, tournaments, crusades, monks, hermits, and relics, knowing that they were in their day the mere prosaic conditions of life, amusement and religion, so different from those of our day that from afar they take on a glamour, as the rough, dusty and parched mountain-sides in Mediter- ranean lands take on a celestial lavender shade seen from miles away. A tourna- ment was a beautified foot-ball and polo game (more dangerous if possible), which brought revenue to the victor from the arms and ransoms of the van- quished. Some men went on crusades with the ideal motives of many of our men in the World War, but some with the more sordid motive of squaring themselves with society for their earlier misdeeds. The pilgrim was often no more than a sanctified tramp, with the ictus on the tramp. The hermit, in the high-tide of the Middle Ages, was a man who devoted himself to a life of strict solitude - at cross-roads. There is little legitimate romance here. How can we do better than base our impressions of the romance of the Middle Ages on the written record of mediaeval ideals, on its literature? What body of mediaeval literature probably seems to us the most significant, the most charac- teristic, the most influential, the most delightful, unless that which gave its name to romanticism? Is not an analysis of the native traits of the romances the best</page><page sequence="3">The Middle Ages-Romantic or Rationalistic? 297 way of analyzing the romanticism of the Middle Ages? There is romance to us, and was often even to mediaevals, in their motives, their characters, their events, their method. The agents who figure in the romances are picturesque if not marvelous - knights, Saracens, scarcely-converted fairies, giants, dragons. Their motives are adventure, idealized loyalty and friendship, love, religion. The events are anything which is surprising or exciting, often with little or no obliga- tion of consistency with prosaic reality, or even of consistency with each other. As to method, most of the romances are the freest of single-file narration, inno- cent of rule and form, careless of unity, in quest only of beauty, wonder and stimulus. But the significance of all this as a symptom of the age must be greatly miti- gated. The very word romance is misleading to the modern. A romantium origi- nally is simply something written in French, in the Romana lingua - just that and nothing more. Marie de France will say, 'This thing became well known, and a poem on it was written in Romance.' A romance in English was always taken from French; and the phrase 'a romance' means simply the kind of poem so called in French, which (roughly) is a vernacular narrative not rigorously historical. However much or little such poems may contain of what we call romance, there is little or no such implication in the mere word. The critical implications of the word for us hardly antedate the seventeenth century, and to this day are less fully established in French than in English. We must introduce two other essential mitigations. The romances embody a romantic impulse far less than appears at first sight, because they are traditional and not invented. Not till toward the end of the middle ages do we find that freedom of the inventive imagination which is most truly romantic, that free- dom which led on into a fully romantic age, the sixteenth century. I will even hazard the opinion that the mediaevals were apt to be uneasy and helpless at free imaginative invention. Earlier we have merely a serious respect for the be- quests of the past and a making-over of them in a form intelligible, useful, and edifying to contemporaries. Romancers in general did not seek to heighten the marvelous which they had inherited, but rather to explain it, and to make of it a memorable embodiment of the principles of conduct which they esteemed. We may justifiably wonder that these works are not more romantic than they are, and conjecture that the vanished oral and inferior written narratives were more so. Even Arthurian literature was far less marvelous to the mediaeval reader than to us. Undoubtedly the incorrigible romanticism of the Celt, as well as the strangeness of his traditions to civilized Europe, was one cause of their immense popular vogue from the twelfth century on. But Chretien de Troyes was more concerned about principles of conduct and quietly satiric psychology. As to Geoffrey of Monmouth, if he used much British tradition, he must have almost hated its romance; any Celtic mist has blown away, and what remains is hard outlines in the most rational Norman taste. Finally, and emphatically, the romances were not written by, nor for, the intel- lectual e'lite, but for the intellectual average, or below, though often for the social Elite. If Dante began with strong romantic tastes, he had them well controlled or</page><page sequence="4">298 The Middle Ages - Romantic or Rationalistic? suppressed as his other side grew. If he found the tales of King Arthur most beautiful, he found them also ambages. Chaucer, less powerful and possibly less capacious-minded, leaves us in little doubt as to his opinion of one of the longest and most read of the Arthurian romances. Of his tale of the cock and hen he says, This storie is also trewe, I undertake, As is the Book of Launcelot de Lake, That wommen holde in ful greet reverence. Chaucer is not a romantic poet. Romance was purely recreative, and at that hardly taken seriously. But there is far more than this. The attitude of mediaeval thinkers and critics toward the whole of imaginative literature was one of profound reserve, even dis- trust, and at times contempt. To that imaginative literature which had come down from the ancients, the mediaeval attitude was paradoxical and double. There was some of the feeling of suspicion and disapproval which had been inherited from the Fathers of the Church, especially St Gregory. Yet there was the touching humility with which mediaeval men regarded everything which had come from the Greeks and the Romans. And there was the ever-insurgent relish for beauty. Man's nimble wit, and especially the mental ingenuity of the Middle Ages, could always find a way out from such a clashing. The way out was alle- gory. Frivolity, moral looseness, wrong theology passed for mere gilded cloaks to austere morality and the Christian verities. The fables borrowed from antiquity, says Jean Bodel of the twelfth century, are serious and teach virtue. Classical poetry accepted the tonsure of at least minor orders, and then was free to wanton a little, as, it is whispered, humans in minor orders were known to do. Or (shall we say) Ovid had to be circumcized in his flesh and become a proselyte before he was admitted to the synagogue of the mediaeval Chosen People and began to do business with them. Allegory assumed that the fanciful, beautiful element in literature was the mere sugar-coating to please the childish or vulgar palate, and that the essence and purpose of classical poetry was physic for moral and spiritual ills. Some one may take me up on allegory, and see in it a romantic device. I say no, and stoutly aver it to be rationalistic. Without a ponderous dis- cussion of its origin and psychology, its Werden und Wesen, some of which I admit I do not understand, I say that, where it is not a mere sugar-coating for a moral pill, or, let us say, a genteel and confidential-looking envelope for an advertise- ment, it is a makeshift attempt at unifying one's intellectual contents. The Mid- dle Ages were still trying hard to keep the universe small and simple enough to go into one head. They had intellectual snobs who were able to know every- thing, if not everybody, that was worth knowing. To admit that there are vast regions of existence and experience which have nothing whatever to do with each other, except that they all exist in the same universe, would have opened the door on the cheery, fireside, mediaeval universe, and let in a stark and chill draft from interstellar space. The Middle Ages were still despairingly trying to grasp the scheme of things entire. One attempt was that arithmetical symbolism which saw significance in numerical agreement between anything in the heavens</page><page sequence="5">The Middle Ages-Romantic or Rationalistic? 299 above or the earth beneath, between the four points of the compass and the forty days of Lent, the seven openings in the head and the seven planets, as Gali- leo found to his cost, it is said. The Middle Ages simply would not face the possi- bility of coincidence, that a striking analogy could be without significance. And so allegory found a connection between the Aeneid and the Christian verities, and between Ovid and the cardinal and theological virtues. The universe was prosai- cally unified where it could be; where it could not be, allegory stated that it was a unit for all that, and continued to spin its spider-filaments from the Red Sea to the village-font, and back and forth across the poor mediaeval brain, and all of it not to excite curiosity and wonder, but to allay them. The avowed preference of serious content to literary beauty wholly determined the mediaeval view of literature. Hence the lack of literary criticism in our sense in the Middle Ages. Why expatiate (said they in effect) on the purely literary, which is so unimportant? Literary criticism languished in the Middle Ages, not because they were not critical enough, but because they were too criticial. Moral criticism filled the place of literary. Such of the latter as existed was practical and rhetorical, meant to show the mediaeval Latinist how to write as the Romans did. The conviction that the works of the ancients are serious and teach virtue re- sulted from the mediaevals' pupillary attitude toward them - and also main- tained it. Why does Chaucer name many ancient writers, some of whom he had not read, and no vernacular writer except Dante, Petrarch, and one other? Why but because in his humility he accepted the superior weight and seriousness of the ancients? Petrarch he thus honors, no doubt, because of his Latin writings; and Dante because he could not refuse to see that in greatness and in moral earnest- ness he belongs with the classics. Why, except for a like reason, does Chaucer name no vernacular work outside his own, unless to ridicule it, save the Romance of the Rose alone? And why that, unless because in its underlying seriousness and critical and literary spirit, in its air of learning, and its overwhelming originality and influence, he felt a kinship with the classics, mistakenly, we may think? Again, Chaucer makes a clear distinction between poet, poetry, poesy, on the one hand, and maker, make, and making, on the other. The two sets of words were no more synonymous than the words poetry and doggerel are today. The former set is reserved for the ancients and for Dante, and the latter for contemporaries and for Chaucer himself. It was so stupid modesty which determined all this; it is due to a practical, ethical and rationalistic standard. Such gradations of dignity between classics and mediaevals are far from being confined to Chaucer. To say nothing of other mediaeval writers, see how the attitude stands out even as late as Milton.

Then to the well-trod stage anon, If Jonsons learned Sock be on, Or sweetest Shakespeare, fancies child, Warble his native Wood-notes wilde. Vernacular poetry was not to be taken with high seriousness, according to the young Milton. Before leaving literature, there are two more points. In spite of notable achieve- ments, the Middle Ages are not remarkable for lyric poetry; and what is most characteristic about it is its strict forms. The sonnet, the ballade, the rondeau, may express deep feeling, but they subdue it to what it works in. If the hearts of Dante and Petrarch were passionate, they had them well under discipline when they wrote. More characteristic are the ethical lyrics of Chaucer and, let us say, Eustache Deschamps, in which noble sentiments find expression with cool sin- cerity and polished reason. And finally, like all times of militant orthodoxy, the Middle Ages were exceedingly remarkable for the satiric spirit. The orthodox satirized deviations, and the more highly individualized satirized the persons of the dominating orthodox. The woman, the ecclesiastic, the peasant - those time-honored cues for satire - people thus punished for being powerful and necessary. Systems were satirized; Chaucer thus treated that characteristic mediaeval formalizing of human emotion and relations, the so-called system of courtly love, on which little which is sound has yet been written. May we believe that, having once been taken in by it, he had his revenge in the Franklin's Tale and elsewhere? It was a characteristic rationalizing and codifying of the romantic love which in a sense began among lighter-minded people in the Middle Ages, got into their literature, and flourished in later times. The rites of the church no more escaped than its ministers did, which implied no skepticism in an age when dogma formed the chief part of invisible reality, and did not need to be protected by a hedge of taboos. No less sharply than in literature, the contrast between the popular and vulgar and the thoughtful and official stands out in ethics. One might touch on romantic ethics, which are not confined to the romances proper. Nothing seems more char- acteristic than the exaltation of one virtue at a time, the laudation of one virtue raised to the nth power, above a just and well-rounded character. Reflect on the tale of Amis et Amile, in which a man sacrifices his children's lives to his friend's health; or on that tale so characteristic of an age when men imposed their own ideals on women, the story of Patient Griselda. But here again we must apply mitigation. No one sat down in cold blood to invent such a story as that of Patient Griselda. It is a rationalized fairy-story, which means Christianized paganism. Griselda's submissiveness and her abandonment of her children, rather than annoy her husband and scant her bargain, is an expression not of medi- aeval ethics but of a fairy-taboo. And it is not without significance that the tale came into its fullest vogue in that romantic sixteenth century. Even the idea of the sanctity of the vow, keeping one's word whatever it costs, which is at the bottom of so many popular tales, has its roots no more in romantic ethics than in the fundamental philosophical conception of the unity and permanence of the</page><page sequence="7">The Middle Ages-Romantic or Rationalistic? 301 personality; a wholesome and practical assumption which one may find pleasure in contemplating in a day whose teachings seem to conspire to break down re- sponsibility and will. But in constrast with popular, nth-power ethics, let us think of other moral ideals of the Middle Ages, more deep-seated than this henotheism, this worship of one virtue at a time. In clearest contrast with the ill-balanced ethics of popular poetry, consider the mediaeval cult of mesure, moderation. I will leave it for the moment to source-hunters to trace it back to the Nicomachean Ethics of Aristotle (or to Confucius, if they wish; it is in his works). The praise of mesure is to be found in Wace and Thomas Aquinas, in Alanus de Insulis, Eustache Des- champs, and many another mediaeval poet. It was an orthodox commonplace among sane and cultivated people, as if in protest against the admiration for senseless martyrdoms, prevalent then as now amongst rabbles. Again, in no age were wisdom and learning paid more mouth-honor, at least; the professor of to- day may 'even look back with a certain pensiveness. The word wise almost be- comes empty of concrete meaning and becomes a vague term of moral approval, thereby exhibiting which way contemporary ideals tended. The lust (almost) of the Middle Ages for wisdom, instruction, edification is exhibited in many ways, some of them touching, some diverting. Further, the Middle Ages branded as one of the seven deadly sins something much like what was cultivated as a matter of literary interest and almost as a virtue in the typical romantic period, the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. The sin of Accidia is not mere laziness, but a slothful melancholy, the negation of all serene and fruitful activity; in the seventh canto of Dante's Inferno we come upon these sinners, Fitti nel limo dicon: 'Tristi fummo nell' aer dolce che dal sol s'allegra, portando dentro accidioso fummo: or ci attristiam nella belletta negra.' The Ossianics and the Byronics would have fared ill before mediaeval judges. No moral trait of the Middle Ages is more engaging than their humility and reti- cence - their disinclination to attach value to one's own private feelings. Medi- aeval humility was not so much that modesty toward other persons which may be nothing better than a cloak for indolence and timidity. Sometimes it meant that good-breeding, that freedom from bullying and arrogance, by which Christi- anity first charmed and then won over the bearish Germanic barbarian. Some- times it meant that humility in presence of an ideal which, when coupled with en- terprise, leads toward achievement and perfection. Nothing can differ more from romantic emotionality and self-assertion. We need not dwell on the rigidly in- tellectual method of mediaeval treatises on ethics, both philosophical and popular, with their seven deadly sins, each with its branches, each branch with its twigs. Men were invited to righteousness, it would seem, by a singularly cool and legalistic path. This is because treatises on ethics were intended to serve the purposes of the sacrament of penance - a thoroughly rational and practical intention. Herein ethics is harmonious with the whole of central mediaeval philosophy and theology, a vast field which I leave after an obeisance to their</page><page sequence="8">302 The Middle Ages - Romantic or Rationalistic? cool clear method, their surpassing sense for order and system, their (on the whole) practical and moderate spirit. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas no less voiced and moulded their age than Kant and Hegel theirs. Not only the culmination of mediaeval education, the teaching of philosophy and theology, but the entire educational system, was as hostile to romanticism as can well be imagined. There was little freedom for the individual, stimulus to inventiveness, scope for self-expression. There were few separate courses of study leading to different careers. There were no Schools of Education - all mediaeval schools were schools of education. There were no California Colleges of Cosmeticology. The mediaevals had as yet much to learn; they were indeed mediaeval. The methods of study in arts, law, medicine, and theology were much the same. There was no elective system to pique and gratify curiosity, and to fit individual likings. The Trivium stretched out before the evil and the good, and the Quadrivium extended its reign over the just and the unjust. The courses were both formal and practical. The study of poetry came, very suggestively, under the head of Grammar and Rhetoric. Rhetoric and Dialectic inducted the student into the scholastic method of discovering new truth and of communicating knowledge, the method of analysis and disputation. However a poet like Mar- tianus Capella at the beginning of the Middle Ages, or like Stephen Hawes at the end, may strive to shed the pearly light of imagination over this system, it was narrow, clear, and exact. That 'brisk lad named Ignorance' whom we meet in Bunyan may have been common in the mediaeval university - as common as in . . . (but why proceed?); if so, it was because he loitered on the Three-fold Path and the Four-fold. Any society which pursued intellectual achievement along the Trivium and Quadrivium was the foe of wayward imagination and ill- controlled feeling. Mediaeval religion (to touch it lightly), like vernacular literature and popular ethics, had its romantic side. Emotionalism from the eleventh century on cul- minated in the yearning love toward Mary,- The sweetness hath his herte perced so Of Cristes mooder that, to hire to preye, He kan nat stynte of syngyng by the weye. As to the marvelous, indeed one might say that legends of the saints were the mediaeval romantic literature par excellence. To and through these favorites of God anything might be supposed to happen, and a hospitable faith in regard to them was almost a spiritual virtue; for, as F. W. Faber said a couple of generations ago, in matters of faith God loves a cheerful giver. It must not be supposed that saints' legends were read chiefly by the pious, like modern lives of missionaries. In fact, after a course of reading in them, without being as severe as Father Dele- haye, the head of the Jesuit Bollandists, is at times, one is inclined to question even if they were written by the pious, at any rate, if some were written by truly devout and high-minded men. Most of them were assuredly not written by able and original men. An impudent attitude toward experience and adult morality, an almost libidinous taste for the fantastic, could be indulged here with im-</page><page sequence="9">The Middle Ages-Romantic or Rationalistic? 303 punity in a sacramental atmosphere, like vulgar gestures in a church. They of- fered a romantic relief superficially harmonious with a supernatural religion; as our detective stories offer a romantic relief superficially harmonious with the grim realism and science which are the religion of the modern 'progressive.' This I say though not blind to the nobility and sincerity which are also found in saints' lives. But these legends belonged more to the romantic impulses of the popular mind than to official religion. And so did much of the romance in religion. The church used romanticism, threw its strong masculine arm of protection around it, sheltered that palpitating heart with a strong cuirass. There was satisfaction for the admirer of pageantry and of marvel, welcome for the emotional, and perhaps canonization for the mystic. For lofty and aspiring souls there were the counsels of perfection, the vows of poverty, chastity and obedience. Mysticism (which is not romanticism) is at the bottom of Christianity. But I think I am right in saying that the mystic was not the characteristic and most influential religious figure of the middle ages; the sixteenth century was the great mystical time of the Latin church. The orthodoxy, ethical and intellectual, which was taken for granted in the Middle Ages was rationalistic. Notoriously, the re- ligion of the Middle Ages was in large measure one of the objective religions, which did not force man's consciousness in on himself. Its minimum demands were intellectual and ceremonial; it required, excacted, no more than acceptance of a clean-cut body of dogma, even with little effort to understand it, and a mini- mum of feeling accompanying certain acts. De facto, it kept chubby and com- fortable, with sin and hell on its lips. This I say of the most wonderful institution which ever existed. As I draw to a close, briefly, but most emphatically, literary students have had a distorted view of the spiritual quality or center of gravity in the Middle Ages because they have confined their notice chiefly to what was written in the ver- naculars. In all western Europe the central stream flowed in Latin. Anyone who wished to be taken seriously wrote in Latin; anyone who wished to be noticed outside his own country, almost, I might say, outside his own circle or class, wrote in Latin. Before the very end of this age, Latin literature is far broader and more representative than the vernaculars. One can even show a little in Latin, relatively little, which in an intelligible sense is romantic in impulse; one can show some things in Latin which express the impulse which now has an outlet in the Comic Supplement. But one can show vastly more which was rationally ideal and, in multifarious ways, practical in its aim and impulse. I believe pro- fessional historians and professional philosophers have understood the Middle Ages better than most literary historians have done, because they know its Latin records better. The best thing the Mediaeval Academy had done is to accept a special mandate over this slighted region. A few words in ending. Fifty years ago mediaeval scholars with justice frowned suspiciously or smiled wearily at attempts to generalize about the Middle Ages. Today it is not too early occasionally to attempt some integration. Even if we agree with whoever the Frenchman was who said, 'No generalization is altogether</page><page sequence="10">304 Economic Rationalism in the Late Middle Ages true - not even this one,' in the long run something of the sort may draw out more truth than it confuses. Even if it is a highly delicate and subtle matter to determine how what we ourselves see and feel in a product of the remote past may differ from the intention and reaction in its own day, nothing is better worth occasionally attempting. Like Bacon, some mediaevalists have not realized the sharpening of the eyesight and the increased comprehension which proceed from a working hypothesis even if not perfectly proportioned. The world may resent our taking away from it the best of the Middle Ages as a romantic playground for its childish moments, and as a fictitious stimulant for its weaker ideality, which scholarship is rapidly doing. But there still remains plenty of stimulus more manful and humane, and plenty of authentic imaginative refreshment, to say nothing of the purely subjective but indestructible lavender coloring afore- mentioned. This discourse is very far from aspiring to define or sum up all the tendencies, the intentions, or the spirit of even the central Middle Ages. But it is true that the best and wisest men of the Middle Ages sought with passionate perseverance to unify and reconcile into an intellectual system all truth which they saw; that their most lasting test of truth was that it should be good, and promised to be useful to man; that they were humanists also in the sense that they really put humanity at the center of everything, and the most usual idea of divinity was a thoroughly anthropomorphic idea, and the loftiest idea of God saw a sublimation of this; that the test of conduct and ethical good was on the whole a social one, a highly disciplined submission to a system, to the good of other people as they conceived it, to the will of God as they conceived him. It is true also that they elaborated and applied their ideals in a notably practical manner; with so much common sense, in fact, that those who in our day are still loyal to this system can move with no appearance of eccentricity among those who live on other principles or on none. The Middle Ages at their best were so humane that one must marvel at the indifference, even hostility, to them shown by those who in our day have taken the name of Humanist. I will not say that we have every reason to expect the New Humanists of Princeton, Iowa, and Harvard to become pious mediaevalists, because I do not wish to end in such a tone. But I will say that if they showed more comprehension of the Middle Ages, their own attempts to distill, integrate, and apply the wisdom of the past would be more appealing and more unshakable.
