It seems clear that a good deal of the cult can be explained by the impressive control that Mao and his faction had gained over the Party by the end of 1942; the Returned Student leadership had been effectively routed,1 and Mao's political and military pre- eminence within the Chinese Communist movement had been augmented on the ideological front. Even in the economic sphere, the Gods had been favorable, for, by the end of 1942, the worst effects of the Japanese and Nation- alist blockade of the Communist areas had been surmount- ed, thus demonstrating the validity of Mao's economic and fiscal policies. Mao's increasing stature in the CCP was strongly reinforced in the course of the Rectification Movement which dominated Yenan, the Communist capital, throughout 1942. It was during this campaign that Mao emerged head and shoulders above all other Party leaders, both as the leader of the practical revolutionary movement and as the foremost exponent of Chinese com- munist doctrine. By the spring of 1943, then, Mao's per- sonal position within the Party was extremely strong; definite signs of a cult had already made their appearance, and it is likely that they would have become ever more unmistakable in the normal course of events. Accordingly, ♦This article is part of a chapter from the author's Ph.D. thesis, "Ch'en Po-ta and the Conscious Creation of 'Mao Tse-tung's Thought,' 1935-1945," which is being completed for the Univer- sity of London under the direction of Professor Stuart R. Schram. It is hoped that the entire chapter will be published as a separate article in due course. the suggestion that the cult of Mao and his thought was more or less an inevitable product of Mao's political su- premacy within the CCP is evident in the writings of many students of Chinese communism. In a preliminary study of Mao's rise to power, for example, the Japanese scholar Noriyuki Tokuda has concluded that: Considered as a consequence of the process of strengthening Mao's leadership which began in 1935, [the] eruption of the Mao cult indi- cated. . .that Mao's 'big push' toward his complete domination of the CCP had been successful.2 That the cult developed with such rapidity, vigour, and depth, however, can best be explained by the for- tuitous set of foreign and domestic circumstances that took shape in late 1942 and the spring of 1943. In par- ticular, it appears that the Battle of Stalingrad, the pub- lication of Chiang Kai-shek's China's Destiny , and the dissolution of the Comintern conjoined in early 1943 to provide a most suitable environment for the blossoming of the cult of Mao Tse-tung and his thought. This obser- vation in no way invalidates the fundamental causal con- nection between Mao's rise to power in the CCP and the subsequent emergence of the dual cult; a connection which, the larger study of which this article is a part, attempts to establish in some detail. Nonetheless, the three additional factors suggested above have usually been neglected in most discussions of the appearance of the cult, and this tends to give too much emphasis to the apparent "inevi- tability" of the cult emerging from the internal political processes of the CCP. Assigning due weight to the contem- porary domestic and foreign environment at the precise moment when the cult erupted will lead to a more sophis- ticated understanding of the total scenario giving rise to</page><page sequence="2">2 the cult of Mao and his thought. Like all complex social organizations, the CCP is shaped in large part by the par- ticular environment in which it operates, and which helps to determine the precise configuration of forces which governs its internal evolution. Hopefully, this point will become clearer in the course of the ensuing discussion, and does not need to be pursued further for the time being. It is essential to bear in mind that Mao's cult developed in the context of ever-increased Nationalist-Communist rivalry, during which each side attempted to elevate its own leader and ideology to a position of first importance in Chinese political life. A powerful impetus was given this rivalry by the sharp deterioration of the Nationalist- Communist united front as a result of the New Fourth Army Incident in January 1941, and subsequent "inci- dents" too numerous to mention.3 Yet in spite of this, the first part of 1941 was hardly a propitious time for the two rivals to force a showdown. The Japanese were well entrenched in China and were beginning to expand into Southeast Asia, with little effective resistance coming from European powers or the United States. Most of Europe had in fact been conquered "by the invading Germans, and Britain was slowly recovering from the onslaught of the Luftwaffe. Russia had gained an un- known amount of breathing space through her mutual non-agression treaties with both Germany and Japan, and the United States appeared reluctant to enter the fray unless forced to do so by direct attack upon her own soil. With the international situation so menacing, neither the Nationalists nor the Communists were really in a position to drive the wedge between themselves even deeper. Indeed, Chiang Kai-shek was forced to divert a good deal of his energy to the task of repairing the damage done to the Nationalists' image by the defection of Wang Ching-wei and the establishment of his puppet government in Nanking.4 Mao Tse-tung, for his part, was fending off various fissiparous tendencies within the CCP that were undermining his own position as leader. Under the circum- stances, it made better sense for each leader to put his own house in order and await a more favorable war situation before forcing a final confrontation with the other. That more favorable situation began to take shape in the second half of 1941; Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union in June of that year brought the reluctant Russians into the struggle, while Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor in December dragged in the equally hesitant Americans. From the point of view of both Chinese sides, National- ist and Communist alike, the war could not have taken a better turn, and it is not surprising that they both adopted a scarcely disguised attitude of "sitting on a mountain top to watch the tigers fight." In deciding upon the attack on Pearl Harbor, even the Japanese leaders themselves realized they could not survive a long war of attrition with the United States, and this observation was of course not entirely lost on their Chinese adversaries.5 They (the Chinese) were most disappointed, then, when Washington decided to give immediate priority to the Western front, thus giving the Japanese much more breathing space than would have been the case otherwise. Nonetheless, the Chinese were gratified to see the almost reckless over- extension of Japan's military capacity gradually begin to take its toll, and their thoughts soon turned to the problem of the appropriate offensive response. The whole process was speeded up by the addition of a most powerful cata- lyst-Stalingrad. Between September 1942 and February 1943, the beleagured Russians not only stopped, but even turned back, the German invasion of Russia in a bloody victory reminiscent of the repulse of Napoleon Bonaparte in the autumn and winter of 1812. The Soviet victory at Stalingrad effectively turned the tide of the war in favor of the allies, and had a tremendous psychological impact not only on the Western world, but in the Far East as well. Certainly, the momentous significance of Stalingrad was well appreciated by Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Tse-tung, both of whom saw in the Russian victory their own per- sonal opportunity to take the offensive.6 The offensive they had in mind, however, was not to be directed pri- marily at the Japanese, who had been faring rather badly in the Pacific struggle with the United States. Rather, each side in the faltering Nationalist-Communist united front regarded the other as the chief focus of attack, although the continuing demands of an at least nominal war-time unity prevented the upsurge of actual civil war prior to the final defeat and expulsion of the Japanese. What was not prevented, however, was a war of words, or a battle for ideological supremacy throughout the nation, and it was to this task the two adversaries turned. The final struggle for the allegiance of the Chinese people was initiated on the ideological front in the spring of 1943; extended to the military sphere in 1946, and finally resolved with the sweeping Communist victory of 1949. It was this initial</page><page sequence="3">3 ideological struggle that precipitated the emergence of "Mao Tse-tung's thought" within the Chinese Commu- nist Party. The Nationalists ' Ideological Offensive Like Mao himself, Chiang Kai-shek was not one to underestimate the importance of ideological struggle, although he was much less adept than his adversary in employing it to effect. Nonetheless, Chiang got the jump on the Communists by publishing, on 10 March 1943, his celebrated book, China's Destiny , at the same time inaugu- rating a massive ideological campaign throughout the coun- try with his book as the movement's intellectual core. In all likelihood, the volume was largely written by Tao Hsi-sheng, a long-time Nationalist adviser, but Chiang most certainly had final editorial control over its specific con- tents, and, in any event, presented the book to the public as his own.7 The work appears to have been written during the very months of the fierce Battle of Stalingrad, and clearly reflects the new optimism the Russian triumph gave rise to, with Chiang declaring that the "opportunity for the recovery of the nation and the hope of the rebirth of the state are now presented to the citizens of the entire country."8 Obviously, Chiang's book was issued to assist the people of China to make the best possible use of this rare opportunity. Despite an acute paper shortage at the time, the first printing was 200,000 copies, and the 213 page volume was priced at only US $.10 to ensure wide circulation among the literate population. By the end of 1943, more than 200 printings of the book had been issued, many of them through printing houses throughout the Nationalist-controlled part of the country. Claimed at the time to be the "most important book written since the Three People's Principles of Sun Yat-sen," Chiang's treatise was often difficult in style and obscure in mean- ing; accordingly, a catechism, synopsis, and book of notes were also published as reference aids to the book's po- tential readers. That they were to be numerous was deter- mined by the fact that China's Destiny became required reading for all civil servants, military officers, members of the Nationalist Youth Corps, and students at the Party's Central Political Training Institute. Further, the book was designated as the "most important extra-curricular reading matter" in Chinese schools, colleges and universities, and the subject of formal examinations at all levels of the edu- cational system. In light of this, one can hardly escape the conclusion of Philip Jaffe, a hostile reviewer of Chiang's text, that it could be fairly described as the "political bible" of the Chinese Nationalists, and the intellectual core of their nationwide ideological campaign.9 Throughout China's Destiny , Chiang Kai-shek hammered home the importance of correct ideology as the foundation of all revolutionary endeavor and national reconstruction. "Sun Yat-sen," claimed Chiang, "saw that the basis of the success of the revolution lay in the psychological recon- struction of the people."10 This was of course a proposi- tion with which even Mao Tse-tung would certainly have agreed (his Marxism notwithstanding), but it left open the question of the specific content of such reconstruction at the psychological level. Chiang quickly dismissed both "Liberalism and Communism" as unsuitable to the tasks ahead, claiming that these foreign ideologies were inherent- ly "opposed to the spirit of China's own civilization," and even instrumental in causing the "decay and ruin of Chinese civilization."11 Rather, said Chiang: . . .the psychological reconstruction of the people should be based on the development of an independent ideology, in which the greatest emphasis must be placed on a revival of the nation's ancient culture and the cultivation of genuinely scientific knowledge. . .The teachings of Sun Yat-sen were based on China's ancient culture, and combined with this the most advanced theories of the world in order to for- mulate China's superior principles of national reconstruction.1 2 With the substitution of Mao Tse-tung's name for that of Sun Yat-sen, this passage could well have appeared in the editorial pages of the Liberation Daily , the official organ of the CCP. Certainly, it illustrates most graphically the degree to which both the Nationalists and the Commu- nists had converged on the importance of constructing an official ideology that was at once distinctly Chinese and undeniably modern. What remained at issue between the two camps was the question as to which political move- ment-Communist or Nationalist- best represented the "correct" path for the Chinese people to follow. On this crucial question, Chiang Kai-shek was quite unequivocal, stressing that the "highest guiding principle in the War</page><page sequence="4">4 of Resistance is the Three People's Principles, and the highest directing organization is the Kuomintang."1 3 Sun Yat-sen was of course long dead and buried, but Chiang showed no hestiation in putting himself forward as the new father of the nation, and the instructor of the masses: I, Chiang Kai-shek, have been identified from the beginning with restarting the Republic of China on the road to independence and free- dom. . .1 wish all my countrymen to examine thoroughly what I have written, and carry these precepts into practice.14 In the opinion of one experienced student of modem Chinese history, it was no accident that Chiang became head of the National Central University at Chungking at the same time that he published China's Destiny as a textbook. True to an "ancient pattern" in Chinese poli- tical leadership, Chiang Kai-shek was inevitably seeking to "progress from the status of Hero to that of Sage."15 The Dissolution of the Comintern In the months following the publication of Chiang's treatise on China's future, the Nationalist Party's accom- panying propaganda campaign unfolded throughout the country. The Communists were of course aware of the implications of the campaign, and, as we know from later events, leading CCP polemicists, such as Ch'en Po-ta, were commissioned to prepare an official critique of Chiang's major theses.16 The Communists were caught somewhat off guard, however, by the surprise announcement of the dissolution of the Communist International. Having come into the war against Germany as a full ally of the Western democracies, the Soviet Union was increasingly obsessed with the struggle in Europe to the relative neglect of the war zones in the Far East. Naturally enough, Stalin became ever more aware of the Comintern's rather incongruous position, dedicated as it was to the promotion of prole- tarian revolution in the very nations with which Russia was allied in the desperate struggle against Fascism. Finally, in response to Allied prompting and as a gesture of good will to the United States in particular, the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the Comintern adopted a resolution on 15 May 1943 recommending the dissolution of the world organization.17 In a sense, the Comintern had been "put on ice" as early as 1935, when its Seventh World Congress emphasized the importance of strengthen- ing the national Communist parties and encouraging their participation in the anti-Fascist united fronts being pro- moted everywhere by the Soviet Union. Nonetheless, the CCP did have to respond to the call for the Comintern's official dissolution, and so on 26 May the Party's Secre- tariat convened an evening meeting in Yenan to deal with the issue. Chaired by Jen Pi-shih, the meeting of Party cadres listened first to Li Fu-ch'un reading aloud the actual Comintern resolution, followed by the Central Com- mittee's response in the name of the Chinese Party. Mao Tse-tung then spoke, covering much the same ground as the Party resolution, and like it5expressing his complete agree- ment with the Comintern's decision to disband. While not- ing the invaluable assistance of the Comintern to the CCP in its early days, Mao went on to stress that the CCP was nonetheless the creation of historic forces within China, and would have appeared and prospered even if help from the Comintern had not been forthcoming.18 In fact, now that the Comintern was departing the scene, there was every reason to believe that the Chinese Party would devel- op even more rapidly. As the Central Committee resolution phrased it, the new situation would "further strengthen" the self-confidence and creativity of all CCP members, "further consolidate" relations between the Party and the Chinese people, and "further heighten" the Party's fighting strength for the arduous tasks ahead.19 The enthusiastic response the CCP gave to the Comin- tern's demise was by no means merely a function of their desire to put a brave face on a fait accompli on the part of their Russian comrades. Rather, it reflected at least the Maoists' genuine doubt as to the Comintern's ultimate value, and their relief at witnessing the nemesis of a once- powerful organization that had consistently discounted the Maoist group in the Chinese Party. Indeed, the Maoists did little to conceal their almost improper delight over the Comintern's fate; they applauded the Comintern's non- intervention in the CCP's "organizational affairs" since 1935, and boasted that the Chinese Party had matured politically in the course of struggles "even more complex than the Russian revolution." As a result, the CCP had given rise to "its own outstanding and well-tested cadres," "had done its work very well" in the struggle for national liberation, and, with regard to the Comintern, had "no</page><page sequence="5">5 longer any need of this international leading centre." On the contrary, argued Mao, the pressing need of the moment was to strengthen the Communist Parties of the various countries, and further, to render them "even more nationalized" (geng jia min-zu-hua) and hence more suited to the needs of national liberation and reconstruc- tion.20 These ringing declarations by Mao and his col- leagues obviously smacked of "petty-bourgeois nation- alism and chauvinism" (as defined in the Marxist lexicon), and one is prompted to inquire as to the Soviet attitude toward these manifestations of independence on the part of the Chinese. Turning to the study of Charles B. McLane, we are reminded that by 1938 Moscow had come to accept Mao Tse-tung's leadership of the CCP, and "was content to let Mao pursue his own course within certain broad limits already well defined and accepted in Yenan."21 Questions of ideological rectitude were placed well behind wartime needs in Moscow's scale of priorities, and the Soviet leaders' specific interest in the Chinese Communist Party hit an all-time low following Germany's invasion of Russia in June 1941. A striking example of indifference amounting to neglect is the fact that the Comintern's major journal, which had given extensive and continuing coverage to events in China up to 1940, did not carry a single article on China or the Sino-Japanese war between June 1941 and its final issue in June 1943.22 Nonetheless, despite the dissolution of the Comintern, Moscow did begin to pay more attention to events in China during the course of 1943. The Soviet victory at Stalingrad, the "troubled course" of Sino-Soviet relations in Sinkiang, and the renewal of tensions between the Nationalists and the Communists all tended to encourage a renewal of Soviet interest in China in the summer of 1943. Yet in spite of this the Soviet leaders held back from open commentary on the CCP and its role in China until after the war for fear of damaging relations with the Nationalist Party and its increasingly enthusiastic benefactors in Washington. This fact is clearly illustrated by the "omission of any reference whatsoever in the Soviet press" of the CCP's important Seventh National Congress in the spring of 1945.23 Considering that this was the first national con- gress held since the Sixth in 1928, and that it was hailed by the CCP press as a "Congress of Victory," the Soviet omission was more than accidental. But if the Soviet leaders were adopting an attitude of studied indifference to the CCP's activities in China, the same cannot be said of Chiang Kai-shek and his advisers. On 6 July 1943, the Nationalist's Central News Agency issued a release claiming that (as the Liberation Daily reported it) certain "cultural organizations" in Sian had held a meeting and resolved to cable Mao Tse-tung, calling upon him to "dissolve" the CCP in light of the Comintern's earlier dissolution, and to "abolish the separatist border region regime."24 In a direct rebuttal of the news release, Mao declared that the whole affair was the handiwork of the Nationalist secret service, claiming that they wrote the text of the cable and then arranged a "ten minute" meeting on 12 June to formally endorse the telegram. This meeting, said Mao, was compos- ed of only ten people, and had been convened at the behest of the secret service by the "Trotskyite and traitor" Chang Ti-fei.25 Naturally enough, Mao declined to accept the advice to disband the CCP, but the incident was indica- tive of an important anti-Communist trend that had e- merged in the wake of the Comintern's disbandment. From the point of view of the Nationalists, the demise of the Comintern could not have come at a better time, dovetail- ing neatly with the major ideological campaign sparked off by the recent publication of Chiang's volume, China's Destiny. That the Communists did not treat the matter lightly is evidenced in the concern expressed in a speech of 1 August by Chou En-lai, who had recently returned to Yenan after a lengthy sojourn in Chungking, Chou dwelt at some length on the problems resulting from the Comin- tern's disappearance from the international scene, and spoke harshly of those, . . .anti-Communist elements inside the country who dare to shout shamelessly for the disso- lution of the Chinese Communist Party. . .They did not raise the outcry before, but at a time after the dissolution of the Communist Inter- national. They claim that after the dissolu- tion of the Comintern, Communism is no longer fit for China, the Chinese Communist Party has lost its backing, the Chinese Commu- nist Party will split from within.26 "Will there be anyone," cried Chou, "to believe their slanders?" He apparently thought so, for he continued on to rebut these "slanders" individually and in some detail. Regarding Marxism's fitness for China, Chou claimed that "owing to the statements of our party leader Comrade Mao</page><page sequence="6">6 Tse-tung," Marxism has "closely united" with the needs of the Chinese nation and has "become rooted in Chinese soil." On the question of the CCP's popular support, Chou acknowledged the early help of the Comintern, but count- ered by adding that it was more important to realize that the CCP is a "party of the masses," one that "grows and develops among the toiling masses of China." On the embarrassing charge of internal Party splits, Chou claimed that the CCP was "united under the leadership of Comrade Mao Tse-tung," and in the previous three years (1940-43) had "reached the greatest degree of consolidation" in its entire history. To underline this point, Chou referred ap- provingly to Mao's leadership of the Party at least seven times in the course of his address, concluding that after the Comintern's demise, the CCP will be "more responsive and independent to solve the problems of the Chinese revolution."27 Chou 's formal acknowledgement of Mao's supremacy in the CCP is an interesting illustration of the linkage existing between the dissolution of the Comintern in June 1943 and the pronounced cult of Mao that erupted within the Party the following July. We have seen that other factors were at work too, in particular, the dramatic turn in the global military situation after Stalingrad, and the intense Nationalist ideological campaign designed to establish Chiang Kai-shek as China's true national leader. These developments heavily reinforced the already notice- able tendencies to promote a Maoist cult that had grad- ually emerged simultaneously with Mao's personal domi- nance in the Party's top leadership, and provided the necessary catalyst for the blossoming of the cult in 1943 when the concept "Mao Tse-tung's thought" was present- ed to the Chinese public for the first time. Rallying Around the Leader In the spring of 1943, Yenan was most certainly alive with speculation as everyone- Party member or not- awaited the leadership's response to the momentous devel- opments detailed above. The initial reaction, as we know from later revelations, came unannounced to the general public, and probably to many ordinary Party members as well. Although specific details are lacking, most authori- ties agree that sometime during the spring, Mao Tse-tung was formally elected chairman of the CCP's Central Com- mittee as well as the Political Bureau. It is most likely that Mao was elevated to these top Party posts in late May when the Central Committee met to discuss its reaction to the dissolution of the Comintern. At or about the same time, Liu Shao-ch'i replaced Chang Wen-t'ien on the Party's five-man Central Committee Secretariat, simultaneously taking over his key position as Secretary-General of the Party.28 Both appointments were highly symbolic as indi- cators of the new political dispensation within the CCP. In the opinion of one student of the subject, there is no evidence of an "explicit bargain" between Mao and Liu. Yet, the latter's elevation to the number two spot in the Party, coupled with his later open praise of Mao's leader- ship, does seem to indicate his faction's acceptance of Mao's claim to supreme leadership, and their concurrence on his election to the Party's top posts.29 Accordingly, Mao himself was able to announce on 1 July 1943, the CCP's twenty-second anniversary, that the Rectification Movement of the previous year had "guaranteed ideolog- ical and political unanimity in the Party and purity in its organizational composition."30 Mao's announcement of Party "unanimity" and "purity" was the green light for the rapid unfolding of the Maoist cult that was to dominate Yenan for the rest of the year. Every person, high or low, Party member or not, expressed his unbridled enthusiasm for and limitless confidence in Mao Tse-tung's leadership. Interestingly, the atmosphere in Yenan at this time was very much one of the "gathering of the clans around the mighty chieftain." On 28 June, just three days prior to Mao's keynote speech, the CCP's top-flight delegation to Chungking returned home to Yenan in time for the Party's anniversary. The mission, headed by personages no less than Chou En-lai and Lin Piao, claimed to have been unable to discuss a "single concrete problem" with Chiang Kai-shek during their lengthy stay at the Nationalist capi- tal.31 No doubt, the timely return of Chou, Lin and "other comrades" from such fruitless negotiations with the CCP's leading adversary contributed to the general feeling that the Party had to go it alone in the decisive years ahead. In any event, soon after the delegation's return to Yenan, all eyes unhesitatingly turned to Mao, the one true helmsman who would safely chart the course of the Party through the stormy seas that lay beyond. Considering Liu Shao-ch'i 's persistent refusal in the past to endorse Mao's leadership claims, especially in the realm of theory, it was somewhat ironic (or perhaps one should say inevitable) that he should set the tone for the new campaign to glorify Mao and all his works. As his</page><page sequence="7">7 contribution to the commemoration of the CCP's twenty - second anniversary, Liu wrote a long essay in which he de- clared that the CCP had finally found its "own leader in Comrade Mao Tse-tung." Mao, said Liu, was a truly out- standing proletarian leader, who . . .has stood the test as a strong and great revolutionary, completely versed in Marxist- Leninist strategy and tactics, and possesses unlimited loyalty to the Chinese working class and the cause of the Chinese people's libera- tion.32 Furthermore, suggested Liu, the history of the CCP had developed "with Comrade Mao Tse-tung as the centre;" Mao had triumphed over "all groups of opportunists" such as those who formerly espoused "dogmatism," and "'Left' opportunism of the civil war period." Having vindicated Mao's line over that of the Returned Students, whom he described indirectly as the representatives in the Party of "Chinese Menshevism," Liu characterized the CCP as having "richer experience in revolutionary struggle" than any other communist party in the world. Yet in spite of this, Liu returned to his long-standing criticism of the CCP on the theoretical front, admitting that the Chinese Party's "preparation in scientific Marxist-Leninist thought has been very inadequate," and that the "theoretical level of many Party members and cadres is low."33 In 1941, when Liu made similar complaints about the Party's theoretical level, he had failed to come up with any positive solutions, simply concluding that the Sinification of Marxism was "exceedingly difficult," and decrying the lack of any "great works" from the pen of a Chinese Communist thinker.34 Now the situation was entirely different. "All cadres and Party members," advised Liu, . . .should diligently study and master Comrade Mao Tse-tung's theories of the Chinese revolu- tion and other subjects. They should arm them- selves with Comrade Mao Tse-tung's thought, and use Comrade Mao Tse-tung's system [of thought] to liquidate Menshevik thought in the Party.35 Liu's essay of 6 July was obviously the signal for the other top Party leaders to rally around Mao Tse-tung as the undisputed head of the CCP. There followed a flood of hagiographie literature from the pens of representatives of the Party's most powerful circles. Among those appear- ing in print were (in addition to Liu Shao-ch'i) Chou En-lai, K'ang Sheng and Teng Hsiao-p'ing as spokesmen of the political wing of the Party; Chu Teh, P'eng Teh-huai and Ch'en Yi representing the military, and people as diverse as Hsu T'eh-li, Hsiao San, and the Japanese Communist Okano Susumu (Nosaka Sanzo) on behalf of cultural circles within the movement.36 The Returned Students were represented also, but in a most fragmented manner which clearly revealed the state of complete disarray into which this once cohesive group had fallen. Wang Chai- hsiang published a key article praising "Mao Tse-tung's thought" on 8 July, just two days after Liu Shao-ch'i's eulogy appeared; Po Ku appears to have procrastinated a little, but finally issued an enthusiastic essay on 13 July. It would seem, however, that neither Chang Wen-t'ien nor, most importantly, Wang Ming could be persuaded to pay obeisance to their former subordinate. Their absence from the pages of the Liberation Daily , though conspicuous, did not dampen the enthusiasm of those leaders who did take pen in hand. The general tone is well illustrated by Po Ku, who took note of the adverse implications the dis- solution of the Comintern had for the unity of the CCP, and responded by calling upon the whole Party to strength- en its already unprecedented degree of unity by rallying "under the banner of Mao Tse-tung." Taking stock of the CCP's many strengths which had ensured its steady growth despite all adversities, Po reminded the readers that, "...fin- ally, and very importantly, we have our Party leader, the helmsman of the Chinese revolution- Comrade Mao Tse- tung. His direction is the direction of our entire Party, and also of the people of the whole nation."37 The Emergence of " Mao Tse-tung's Thought " Liu Shao-ch'i's essay of 6 July 1943 has rightly been regarded as setting the tone of the Maoist cult that was to blossom in later months. In addition, it has been pointed out that it was in this piece of writing that the term "Mao Tse-tung's thought" first appeared in Chinese Communist literature.38 This appears to be true, but it would be a mistake to jump to the conclusion that Liu was the actual creator of the term that was to occupy such a prominent place in modern Chinese intellectual history. Rather, the</page><page sequence="8">8 evidence would suggest that the official use of the new term was the result of a formal, collective decision among the top Party leadership. In his essay of 6 July, Liu referred to "Comrade Mao Tse-tung's thought" (Mao Ze-dong tong-zhi de si-xiang)' yet in an article written on 5 July (though not published until the 8th), Wang Chai-hsiang used the more precise term which later became the terme fixe , "Mao Tse-tung's thought" ( Mao Ze-dong si-xiang). In addition, other Party leaders and theorists (e.g., Ch'en Po-ta) began to use the term in their writings, indicating that there had probably been a prior decision on its use coming from high authority. Regardless of who actually thought up the term in the first place and lobbied for its acceptance by the Politburo (or possibly the Central Committee), it was most certainly Wang Chia-hsiang who composed the most interesting and important interpretation of what the term really meant. This he did in his lengthy essay, "The Chinese Communist Party and the Road to China's National Lib- eration," a text which deserves a prominent place in the intellectual history of the CCP. The basic ideas in Wang's essay are not original, but are largely derived from the debates on the union of Marxist theory and Chinese prac- tice which had been going on within the CCP from at least 1935, debates to which Wang had personally contri- buted from time to time.39 Rather, the importance of the article lies in Wang's explicit application, for the first time, of the conclusions emerging from these debates to the interpretation of Mao's personal theoretical contributions. Briefly, Wang claimed that the essential union of Marxist theory and Chinese reality, which the CCP had been pur- suing throughout the twenty-two years of its existence, was to be found in "Mao Tse-tung's thought." The Chinese Communist Party, in Wang's opinion, had at long last come of age; it had recognized that, "The correct path in the entire course of China's national liberation- past, present and future- is Comrade Mao Tse-tung's thought, the path pointed out bv Comrade Mao Tse-tung in his writings and practice."4 Now, how does Wang justify this claim in terms of theory? Before going into his argumentation, we should note the sense of national pride that informs his entire discussion. China, Wang informs us, is a "great country" (da guo ), and deduces from this that the CCP should therefore be a "great party" possessing its own "Chinese Communist theory."41 That this proposition has any scientific validity can of course be seriously questioned, but in any case Wang does offer a more sophisticated ra- tionale for the appearance of "Mao Tse-tung's thought" in China. To provide the Chinese reader with a comparative historical context, Wang refers them to the development of Leninism in Russia during the course of the Bolshevik revolution. Citing the authority of Lenin himself, Wang points to the gradual formation of Bolshevism in the context of European intellectual trends (especially Marx- ism) and the practical revolutionary movement in Tsarist Russia. According to Wang, This was the process which gave rise to Russian Bolshevism. It was the union [xiang jie-he] of Western European Marxist theory and Russian revolutionary experience which produced Bol- shevism, Leninism.42 Is the situation any different in the Chinese case? Wang does not think so, apart from indicating that the intel- lectual and political milieu in which the CCP developed was perhaps even more complicated than in the case of pre- revolutionary Russia. With this exception, the process was essentially the same: Chinese communism- Mao Tse-tung's thought- is the product of the combination [xiang jie- he] of Marxism-Leninism and the practical experience of the Chinese revolutionary move- ment.43 This interpretation of the origins of "Mao Tse-tung's thought," continues Wang, completely undermines the allegations of those "anti-Communist elements" in China who maintain that, "The theory of the Chinese Communist Party is the theory of the German Marx and the Russian Lenin, and hence is not suitable to the national situation (guo qing)."44 Quite to the contrary, concludes Wang, these critics of the CCP have failed to realize this funda- mental truth: "Mao Tse-tung's thought is Chinese Marxism- Leninism, Chinese Bolshevism, Chinese communism."45 Lest any ambiguity remain, Wang reiterates that, "[Mao Tse-tung's thought] is creative Marxism-Leninism, the development of Marxism-Leninism in China; it is Chinese communism, Chinese Bolshevism."46 It is clear from Wang's disputation that he is advancing "Mao Tse-tung's thought" as a substantive replacement for</page><page sequence="9">9 Marxism-Leninism as such. This is not because he believes that Mao's thought- as "pure theory"- is in any way superior to Marxism-Leninism, but simply because, in the Chinese context, Mao's thought is Marxism-Leninism. This interpretation is derived from the oft-repeated Chinese Communist assertion that there is no such thing as ( Ab- stract" truth or theory; they can only exist in specific, concrete, and, in the case of political truths and theor- ies, national forms. Marxism, then, is the appropriate form of proletarian theory for the Germans (and possibly the West Europeans in general), Leninism (and Stalinism) for the Russians, and "Mao Tse-tung's thought" for the Chi- nese. In light of this, Wang sees no need to distinguish explicitly between Mao's political doctrines in terms of whether or not they represent only " si-xiang " (thought) or, perhaps more broadly, only " zhu-yi " (-ism, i.e., princi- ple, tenet). Clearly, these two terms are completely inter- changable- "Mao Tse-tung's thought" is Marxism-Leninism, and vice-versa; si-xiang is zhu-yi , and conversely, zhu-yi is si-xiang . Hence, it would appear that later academic at- tempts to divide Chinese Communist ideology into two distinct components, namely, "pure ideology" (Marxism- Leninism) and "practical ideology" (Mao Tse-tung's thought), are faulty, at least for the period under consider- ation. Even if these terms are retained for purposes of analysis, we can readily see that for Wang Chia-hsiang and his colleagues, "Mao Tse-tung's thought" is the embodi- ment of both the "pure" and the "practical" aspects of proletarian ideology in China. In any event, such a divi- sion of their ideology would probably be seen by most Chinese Communist theoreticians as "mechanistic," and not reflecting the integrated unity inherent in Mao's thought.47 Yet, we are still left with the puzzle as to why the term, "Mao Tse-tung's thought," was used in the first place, especially as it was equated with Marxism-Leninism as such. After all, in 1941 the Party theoretician, Chang Ju-hsin referred to Mao's body of doctrines as "Mao Tse- tungism" (Mao Ze-dong zhu-yi).48 Why was Chang's perfectly logical term dropped in favor of the new formu- lation? We have already discounted the possibility that the Chinese were trying to distinguish between "pure" and "practical" ideology (zhu-yi and si-xiang ), for they clearly believed that Mao's thought contained both. Nor does it appear likely, as some have suggested, that the term zhu-yi carried undesirable connotations associated with such "evil winds" as individualism, commandism, tailism, Trotskyism, etc. After all, the Chinese Communists have consistently used zhu-yi in their translation of such highly respectable ideological currents as Marxism, Leninism, Stalinism and even Sun Yat-senism, to name but a few.49 Rather, it would seem that the use of si-xiang was a distinct attempt to get away from the essential foreignness of zhu-yi , and the sense of abstractness associated with it. As James Chieh Hsiung has pointed out, the term zhu-yi was import- ed into China, possibly via Japanese ( shugi ), in the early twentieth century.50 In their intense desire to "Sinify" Marxism-Leninism, it was only natural that the Maoists would want to replace the foreign term with one that was unmistakably Chinese. Hence, their use of si-xiang . None- theless, it should not be concluded that it was merely for reasons of linguistic nicety that the term zhu-yi was aban- doned. The fact is that while the actual term, Marxism- Leninism, had long been foreign in form, the new inter- pretation of Mao's thought had rendered Marxism-Leninism abstract in content as well. By defining Marxism and Leninism as solely the German and Russian forms, respec- tively, of proletarian ideology, the Chinese denied their concrete existence in China, and hence their need to be replaced. Thus, in choosing a new term to represent the concrete nature of Mao's reformulation of the classical doctrines, there was a need to avoid close identification with the old terms. All this does not tell us, however, why the Maoists specifically chose si-xiang to illustrate the unmistakable Chineseness and concreteness of the new orthodoxy. We can be reasonably sure that si-xiang , a common word in the Chinese vernacular, met the need for a term that was distinctly Chinese in form, one that would not grate on the Chinese ear, nor appear strange in written form. As to the question of content, it would seem that si-xiang lacks the sense of abstract rigidity which had come to be associated with zhu-yi . An anthropomorphic term, si-xiang fully reflects its vital link with a real, live human being, a specific flesh-and-blood individual- in this case Mao Tse-tung- who is engaged in the continuing process of reflection. This in turn suggests a certain dyna- mism, a feeling that the si-xiang in question is engaged in a process of interaction with reality, creatively responding to the changing circumstances with which it is confronted. Nor does si-xiang give an impression of the idée fixe , a body of doctrine frozen in time. Rather, it conveys the feeling of open-endedness, the possibility of flexible re- sponse, and the promise of a continuing dialogue with</page><page sequence="10">10 reality. It is this dynamic fusion of the human mind and external reality that best characterizes the distinctive quality of si-xiang , and, interestingly, of Mao Tse-tung's personality as well. As Professor Hsiung has suggested most convincingly, The szu-hsiang perspective conceives of man (the subjective world) and his environment (the objective world) as forming an integral whole. . . Any analysis that separates ideology in its 'pure' form from ideology in practice fails to capture the true spirit of szu-hsiang .51 Conclusion In a sense, the formal appearance of "Mao Tse-tung's thought" in July 1943 brought to an end a lengthy process of intellectual and political fermentation within the Chinese Communist Party. The demands of Chinese nationalism for the "Sinification" of Marxism-Leninism had been met, and the perfect fusion of power and ideology, that had for so long eluded Mao Tse-tung, had at last taken place. While the Russians maintained their wartime silence on this momentous development within the CCP, Mao's ideological claims received the approval of other sections of the inter- national Communist movement. In his introduction to the American publication of Mao's New Democracy , Earl Browder, the leader of the United States Communist Party, wrote on 11 November 1944 that Mao's famous essay was "thoroughly Chinese and at the same time thoroughly Marxian, and proceeds from many assumptions and concep- tions of Chinese and Marxian origin."52 Yet there was much to do in the wake of the CCP leadership's deci- sion to promote the cult of Mao and his thought in re- sponse to the new challenge posed by the Nationalists' recent ideological offensive. In the field of ideology, spe- cifically, five major tasks presented themselves: (1) pro- pagation of Mao's cult and thought both within and with- out the Party; (2) formulation and propagation of a major critique of Nationalist ideology; (3) provision of historio- philosophical content to the concept of "Mao Tse-tung's thought;" (4) construction of an official Maoist interpreta- tion of CCP history, and (5) preparation for the long- delayed Seventh Party Congress to ratify the Maoist ascen- dancy in both the political and ideological spheres. These key tasks were pursued methodically and successfully during 1943-45, and do not concern us here. We need only note that it was in 1943 that "Mao Tse-tung's thought" entered into the world, or, as the Chinese were to claim most immodestly in later years, the world entered the "era of Mao Tse-tung's thought." Had the Battle of Stalingrad, the Nationalists' ideological offensive, and the dissolution of the Comintern not so fortuitously coincided in the spring of 1943, it is unlikely that the cult and thought of Mao Tse-tung would have burst upon the scene with the tremendous vigor they did, or with the degree of per- manence they have since enjoyed in Chinese political life.
