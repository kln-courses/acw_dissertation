Bir Bioengineering Center, Wayne State University Copyright © 2007 SAE International ABSTRACT This paper builds on previous research on the development of a head displacement model for restrained occupants in frontal collisions. Physical and mathematical simulations were performed utilizing the 5th percentile female and 50th percentile male Hybrid III dummies to measure the effect of occupant size, seat belt system design and crash severity on resultant head displacement of occupants in frontal collisions. Sled and simulation accelerations ranged from 10 g to 20 g with delta-V's from 6.6 m/s to 10.0 m/s. Results indicate a difference between the 5th percentile female and 50th percentile male dummies. Preliminary assessment of head displacement as a function of occupant kinetic energy demonstrated good correlation. INTRODUCTION Experimental testing and occupant simulation are two ways in which occupant kinematics are typically assessed in automotive safety. Due to financial and time constraints within the accident reconstruction industry, these tools and techniques may not be feasibly utilized for analysis, however the need to assess occupant motion still exists. Prior researchers have attempted to develop mathematical models based on grouping results from a wide range of available occupant displacement data found in the literature. Araszewski et al. (1999) reviewed and compiled head displacement data from previously published research on frontal impacts. Linear regression analysis was performed to develop a mathematical relationship between maximum head displacement and delta-V. The authors analyzed head displacement by occupant size and although no statistical conclusion could be met, they determined the occupant size had little effect on head displacement. Happer et al. (2004) provided an update to the Araszewski et al. model by adding additional data points and updated prediction intervals for maximum head displacements. While neither study found occupant size to have an affect on head displacement, the data that comprises these regression models were primarily head displacement measures of mid-sized male test devices and human volunteers. Prior generations of the current Hybrid III test device comprise the majority of the human surrogate data points. Prior studies contradict these findings and indicate that occupant size will affect maximum head displacement. Mertz et al. (1995) performed numerical simulations to asses the effect of load limiting retractors on occupant excursion in 24 to 56 km/h frontal collisions. They assessed both 50th percentile male and 95th percentile male occupant sizes. They demonstrated that the larger 95th percentile occupant has larger head displacements under all tested conditions when compared to the 50th percentile male. In addition to occupant size, seat belt system design has also been shown to affect occupant head displacement. Siegmund et al. (2004) demonstrated the effect that seat belt geometry changes and additional webbing slack has on maximum head excursion at a moderate impact severity of 17 km/h. An additional 10 cm of belt slack was compared to a snug belt condition in addition to modified seat belt anchor points. The authors concluded that moving the anchor points forward increases head excursion as well as adding slack to the system. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of occupant size on maximum head displacement in controlled frontal collisions at three crash severities. Seat belt anchor point geometry is also investigated to assess variance of restraint system design from vehicle- to-vehicle. 1407</page><page sequence="2">METHODS GENERAL A triangular sled pulse was generated with three crash severity targets: 10 g, 15 g and 20 g (6.6 m/s, 8.3 m/s, 10.0 m/s). Figure 1 depicts a sample of these pulses. A simulated occupant compartment was constructed consisting of a rigid frame structure surrounding the occupant. The outboard rear location served as a B- pillar for mounting of the seat belt assembly. A generic toe pan was also utilized for control of the dummy leg kinematics. These components were rigidly attached to a HYGE sled carriage. Figure 1: Examples of 10 g, 15 g and 20 g crash pulses. INSTRUMENTATION HYGE sled acceleration was obtained via two linear accelerometers Model 7264C (Endevco, San Juan Capistrano, CA). These accelerations were averaged and integrated to determine sled change-in-velocity or Delta-V. Seat belt loads were monitored via four belt- type load cells (Robert A. Denton, Inc., Rochester Hills, Ml) attached to the shoulder and lap belt webbing. Loads cells were attached to the seat belt webbing at the following locations: shoulder belt near the D-ring, shoulder belt at the latch plate, lap belt at the latch plate and lap belt near the seat belt anchor point. ANTHROPOMORPHIC TEST DEVICES Two Hybrid III dummies were utilized for the testing: the Hybrid III 50th percentile male and the 5th percentile female. The dummy was placed in a normal seated posture and measurements were taken with reference to the generic B-pillar for positioning of the dummies. Figure 2: Experimental test setup with a 50th percentile male and 5th percentile female occupant. SEAT AND SEAT BELTS The front driver seat of a 2000 Honda Civic was utilized and felt to represent a typical car seat design. New 2000 Honda Civic driver side three-point seat belts and corresponding buckles were purchased for the testing and replaced for each run. It is equipped with a webbing and vehicle sensitive emergency locking retractor (ELR). The retractor is also equipped with a "web grabber" to limit film spool. The seat belt system was of continuous webbing construction with a plastic "pass-through" free sliding latch plate and plastic coated D-ring. The seat belt webbing had a load-limiter stitch design near the belt anchor attachment on the outboard side of the lap belt. The belt retractor and D-ring were mounted on the outboard side to a generic B-pillar fixture which was rigidly mounted to the sled. The seat belt D-ring attachment point was chosen primarily upon the geometry of the generic B-pillar structure as apposed to the actual Civic design. The inboard side was mounted to the seat frame via the belt buckle. An example of the test setup is demonstrated in Figure 2. DATA COLLECTION AND PROCESSING A 32-channel TDAS PRO (DTS, Seal Beach, CA) rack system equipped with four TDAS PRO sensor input modules were utilized for data collection. Each channel is equipped with an eight-pole Butterworth anti-aliasing 1408</page><page sequence="3">filter with a fixed -3dB knee point. Data were sampled at 20 kHz and filtered according to SAE J21 1/1 . PHOTOGRAPHY AND IMAGE ANALYSIS A Kodak Ektapro HG Imager Model 2000 (Eastman Kodak, San Diego, CA) digital high speed camera was mounted off-board and perpendicular to the sled to capture gross sagittal plane dummy kinematics. Video data were recorded at 1000 frames/second. Digital video analysis of the sagittal plane kinematics was performed using Image Express (Sensor Applications Inc., Utica, NY) Image analysis had an accuracy of ± 4 mm in the vertical measures and ± 5.5 mm in the horizontal measures determined by measurement of targets mounted to the rigid test frame. SIMULATION A mathematical equivalent to the experimental setup was constructed in MADYMO (Version 6.3) and depicted in Figure 3 to study the effect of variations in seat belt anchor points. The ellipsoid multi-body dummy models were chosen on the basis of run-time efficiency. A finite element seat belt was applied using EASi-Crash-Mad preprocessing software. Seat belt and seat stiffness properties were taken from the frontal impact demo model provided within the MADYMO applications database and tuned to match experimental results. Occupant head displacement was determined by output of the center-of-gravity of the head ellipsoid for validation against experimental test data. Figure 3: 5th percentile female (left) and 50th percentile male (right) ellipsoid dummy models. Resultant head displacement was utilized as the primary validation data between experimental and analytical tests. Head, chest and pelvic resultant accelerations along with outboard shoulder and lap belt loads were also monitored and compared to experimental results. The AutoDOE software package was utilized for performing the seat belt anchor point parameter study. Five vertical positions of the seat belt D-ring height adjustor were evaluated (± 102 mm) relative to the baseline position. Five horizontal positions of the D-ring attachment point on the B-pillar were also evaluated relative to the baseline position (± 102 mm). Three inboard seat belt buckle horizontal positions were evaluated. The buckle was adjusted fore and aft of the baseline position (± 50 mm). Seventy-five simulation runs were performed for each occupant at each impact severity using a full factorial for a total of 450 simulations. RESULTS EXPERIMENTAL Head displacement results are depicted in Table 1 . Both 50th percentile male and 5th percentile female displayed increasing head displacements with increasing severity as expected with the exception of the 50th percentile male at the 10 m/s test (Figure 4). An unexpected decrease in head displacement from the 8.3 m/s severity was observed. Closer exam of the dummy setup revealed the head position of the dummy in the 10 m/s test was in fact positioned 25 mm forward and 25 mm superior to the 6.6 and 8.3 m/s test positions, altering the seat belt interaction with the dummy. The 5 percentile female head displacement demonstrated a linearly increasing trend as expected. 10g 15g 20g 5th I 50th 5th I 50th 5th I 50th R 0.243 0.281 0.299 0.345 0.340 0.333 X 0.199 0.245 0.237 0.285 0.258 0.270 Z I -0.179 I -0.162 I -0.203 ļ -0.227 | -0.249 | -0.225 Table 1: Experimental results for resultant (R), horizontal (X) and vertical (Z) head displacements. Figure 4: Experimental sled results depicting maximum head displacement. Detailed inspections of the seat belt systems were performed and results may be referenced in Raymond et al. (2006) including post-test photographs of the load- limiting stitching. At the 10 g severity, neither 5th nor 50th percentile occupant tests resulted in failure of the stitching. At the 15 g severity, the 50th percentile test resulted in failure of three stitches where the 5th percentile test resulted in failure of only one stitch. The 20 g, 50th test resultant in failure of two stitches. Multiple 20 g test conditions were performed for the 5th percentile female with failures of one, two and seven 1409</page><page sequence="4">stitches respectively. In an attempt to reduce the confounding effect of increased head excursion due to stitch failure, the 20 g, 5th percentile female test associated with two stitch failure was utilized for the simulation correlation. SIMULATION Occupant responses and seat belt loads for both experimental and MADYMO baseline simulations are listed in the Appendix along with sample head displacement plots to demonstrate correlation quality. The 5th percentile female head acceleration demonstrated a slightly higher peak in the simulation in comparison to the experimental due to the dummy chin- to-chest contact. This was felt to be an artifact of the chin ellipsoid rather than a correlation issue. Plots of resultant head displacement are also given in the Appendix for reference. The dummy position for the 50th percentile male 10 m/s test was held constant from the 6.6 and 8.3 m/s experimental setup to investigate the difference in predicted head displacement versus experimental results. The simulated head displacement at the 10 m/s severity demonstrated an incremental increase over the 6.6 and 8.3 m/s tests similar to the 5th percentile female experimental results, serving to reinforce the occupant positioning error in 50th percentile experimental setup. Reasonable agreement was felt to have been met between simulation and experimental resultant head displacements. Table 2 lists resultant head displacement results from the seat belt parameter study. These data were then plotted as a function of sled delta-V and presented in Figure 5. Linear regression analysis was performed and resulting mathematical equations and coefficients of determination (R2) are displayed in Figure 6. A statistically significant difference was found between maximum head displacement of the 5th percentile and 50th percentile simulation results for all three severities (P &lt; 0.05). ANOVA results demonstrate that horizontal positioning of the buckle and D-ring were the two factors that contributed to the largest changes in maximum head displacement. D-ring vertical position had less of an effect on maximum head displacement over the impact range tested although all variables demonstrated significance (a = 0.05). 10g 15g 20g 5th I 50th 5th I 50th ~5th I 50th Mean (m) 0.233 0.280 0.272 0.352 0.304 0.413 S.D.

DISCUSSION The experimental results of the 50th percentile male compared well with the regression mean of Happer et al. at the 6.6 and 8.3 m/s severities (Figure 7). The 5th percentile female consistently fell below the mean of Happer et al. as well as the current 50th percentile male at the 6.6 and 8.3 m/s severities. Figure 7: Experimental results plotted against Happer et al. regression mean. 1410</page><page sequence="5">The seat belt anchor point parameter study for the 5th percentile female did not account for the statistical difference found between the mean regression of Happer et al. or 50th percentile male of the current study (Figures 8 and 9). This seems to indicate that differences in lap and shoulder belt attachment points are most likely not responsible for the difference in maximum head displacement with the Happer et al. mean but rather occupant size. Figure 8: DOE 5th percentile female results plotted against Happer et al. regression mean. Figure 9: Linear regression analysis of DOE results in comparison with Happer et al. mean regression. In an attempt to develop a single regression model that incorporates occupant size, mean MADYMO head displacements were explored as a function of an occupant's kinetic energy. This was done with the assumption that the mass difference between the 5th and 50th percentile dummies was the paramount factor resulting in head displacement differences rather than height differences. The mass of each dummy (51kg and 78 kg respectively) along with delta-V were used to calculate kinetic energy for each of the three crash severities. These data were then cross plotted with the corresponding head displacements and displayed in Figure 10. Good correlation was found (R = 0.98) between occupant kinetic energy and head displacement. Future studies should include an analysis of other occupant sizes such as the 95th percentile male and child head displacements as a function of kinetic energy to investigate this relationship further. Figure 10: Maximum head displacement as a function of occupant kinetic energy. Limitations of this study and extrapolation of results include consideration for variations in seat belt system design such as retractor load limiters, pretensioners and retractors lacking web-grabbers. This study did not take into account the addition of seat belt slack. The addition of webbing slack to the system has been shown to increase the maximum head displacement of occupants [5]. This study was limited to delta-Vs between 6.6 and 10.0 m/s. In many modern vehicles it would be expected to have frontal airbag deployment in this range of crash severity. This study does not take into account interaction with frontal airbags which would serve to limit head displacement. Additional data points are desirable when performing linear regression analysis. Conclusions regarding linear relationships of the subject data should be considered preliminary. CONCLUSION Experimental and numerical models demonstrate that occupant size does have an effect on maximum head displacement in frontal collisions. Head displacement increases linearly at a rate of 25-39 mm for every 1 m/s increase in delta-V. Utilizing the kinetic energy regression equation allows for a preliminary assessment of maximum head displacement of various size occupants for both accident reconstruction analysis as well as restraint system development, specifically for rear-seat occupants where additional restraint, such as airbags, are not currently being utilized.
