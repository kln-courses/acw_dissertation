<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sociology of Knowledge and Traditional Thought By Α. Κ. Saran The discontinuity between concept and reality is the key-problem to which the sociology of knowledge is an answer. This implies that the nature of the sociology of knowledge differs significantly from other special sociologies. The sociology of religion (or the sociology of music, art, literature, etc.) is not necessarily itself a kind of reli gion. The sociology of knowledgd is inescapably a kind of know ledge. In other words, the sociology of knowledge is necessarily a self-referent concept, from which it follows that the question of its epistemological relevance is intrinsic to it. The self-referring nature of the sociology of knowledge has far reaching consequences some of which will be considered in due course; at the moment we wish to consider that conception of it which implies a denial of its self-referent character. Our reference is to Professor Werner Stark's distinction between the Theory of Ideology and the Sociology of Knowledge properly so called. This is in opposition to Mannheim's conception, particularly to his view that the Sociology of Knowledge develops from the Marx ian theory of ideology by a process of generalising and extending its logic, method and scope: or, in Mannheim's own words, the total conception of ideology leads to the sociology of knowledge. Mannheim,ho we ver, draws a rather unclear distinction between the total or generalized theory of ideology and the sociology of knowledge. But he does think that the theory of ideology is an in tegral part of this new discipline. Professor Stark wants to eliminate it altogether. This, as Professor Stark rightly emphasizes, is central to an understanding of the sociology of knowledge. We shall exa mine this view. According to Professor Stark the decisive difference between the theory of ideology and the sociology of knowledge is as follows: "The former deals with a mode of thinking which is thrown off its proper course, the latter with all modes of thinking, and especially with those which form the intellectual framework of our whole world-view and which exist long before any falsifying interest begotten tendency can assert itself. If all men could and would</page><page sequence="2">34 come to control their subconscious and rise superior to the insinua tions of selfish or sectional interests, the doctrine of ideology would die off, becaues there would be no more raw material left in the con temporary world for it to study. But the sociology of knowledge would be as important as before. No society can see the vastnesses of reality at the same time from all conceivable angles; only the divine mind can be imagined to be capable of this possibility; every so ciety must take up some concrete vantage-point from which to survey the broad—the unbounded—acres of that which is, and every so ciety will therefore have its own particular picture of reality because it sees reality, and must see it, in one particular perspective. The thesis of the sociology of knowledge is that the choice of the vantage point from which the ens universale is envisaged, depends in every concrete society on the human relationships which make that society what it is; but it is not asserted that selfish or sectional interests enter into the matter already at the point where the fundamental vision first springs into being. That they may come in later on and assert themselves is not to be denied; but that is an entirely different prob lem. The sociology of knowledge does not deal with warped thought; rather it deals with the crystallization or 'concretization' of thought in the sense that countless different constructions and inter pretations of reality are in principle equally possible, while only one of them can be implemented and elaborated at any one time, and the selection of the one out of the many is, in its submission, always so made that a mental universe emerges which will fit in with the pattern of human relationships characteristic and constitutive of the society concerned."1 Professor Stark is of course fully aware that this comes very close to Mannheim's well-known distinction between Particular-eva luative and the Total-non-evaluative theories of ideology. The latter is synonymous with the sociology of knowledge. Professor Stark, however, is very keen to avoid what he regards as the confusion of the sociology of knowledge with the total theory of ideology which he calls pan-ideologism. If Professor Stark's distinction is valid one gets rid of the logical weaknesses in the foundations of the sociology of knowledge. Hence a careful examination of this view is required for the cla rification of the logical status of the sociology of knowledge. In the cited passage the following points have been made: 1. Stark, Werner, The Sociology of Knowledge, 1958, pp. 49-50,</page><page sequence="3">35 (i) The theory of Ideology relates to an accident of human know ledge, however universal, whereas the sociology of knowledge deals with an essential condition of all human knowledge. (ii) The theory of ideology indicates and analyses the distortion of the perspective whereas the sociology of knowledge concerns it self with the specificity of the perspective. (iii) The theory of ideology deals with the validity trf thought whereas the sociology of knowledge is concerned with the 'crystalliza tion' of thought (in a specially defined sense of the word to be indi cated in the discussion that follows). Let us examine each point seriatim : As to the first point, we are highly skeptical of the validity of universal contrafactual conditionals in the form used in his argu ment: "If all men could control their subconscious " Now, how can one identify such a situation? How will it differ from the con tray situation in which no one could control his subconscious?— Such arguments ignore the crucial difference between the logic of 'Some' and the logic of 'All'. From another point of view, however, it may be said that the force of this argument lies' in the assertion that the 'determination' by the subconscious can be thought aimy whereas the situational (structural) and perspectival determination cannot be even thought away. (In other words, the former represents an anthropological impossibility, the latter a logical one). Professor Stark does not ela borate his grounds for this difference. It seems clear, however, that he argues somewhat as follows: the ideological distortions are par ticular distortion and hence there is no logical impossibility in posit ing a state when all distortions will be removed, on the other hand, the social determination represents the general condition of all know ledge and hence it is logically inseparable from it. In other words, ideological elements represen t defects or limitations of individual thinkers and not of thinking as such. Now in the first place, it is important to be clear about the mean ing of this distinction. For instance, one cannot think without lan guage or in a language without syntax. This is a characteristic of thinking as such and not a limitation of the thinker. But what does control of 'subconscious' mean? Does it mean that the subconscious is not a necessary layer of the human mind so that some thinkers are influenced by it while others are not? This is clearly not so, since</page><page sequence="4">36 those who put forward this idea also maintain that the conscious, the unconscious and the subconscious are the necessary divisions of the human psyche. The hypothesis that all men could be in full control of their subconscious amounts, in other words, to the abolition of the concept of the subconscious (and the unconscious) and this means a fundamental change in the structure of man's mind—whatever such a radical reform of man's mind may mean. If this is what Professor Stark intends, it is pertinent to ask as to why the social or situational determinations too cannot be overcome. There may be two reasons for this : one, that the influence of the "Subconscious" (and sectional interests) operates on the individual plane whereas the social deter mination operates on the collective plane. And two, that the sub conscious, after all, conditions only the individual mind—but social determination refers to the universal conditions of knowledge—con ditions arising from the spatiotemporality of existence, and hence even a reformed 'all-conscious' mind will have to function under these very conditions and to that extent be subject to them. (The second, it will be seen, is the more basic argument of which the first may even be regarded as only a corollary). It is characteristic of Professor Stark that while speaking of the ideological doctrine he speaks in terms of individual thinkers, but the very next moment, when he comes to the sociology of knowledge he changes the terminology and talks of 'society': "No society can see the vastness of reality from all conceivable angles " etc. This is surprising, for the statement means precisely nothing unless the word "society" is taken as a summary term standing for all individual members of a given human group. But when thus interpreted it presents the same difficulty: why should we suppose that the indivi dual can transcend his subconscious, attain complete mastery of his mind, go beyond the collective unconscious,—if that concept is ad mited—but cannot transcend the limitations of his situation? The only answer is the second argument mentioned above, viz., that these limitations are necessary in the' sense that they arise from the tempo rality and finitude of the human condition. But this is obviously un tenable; for the limitations and the distortions arising from the sub conscious arise from the same source and cannot be overcome either individually or collectively without the abolition of time. The other two points can be dealt with briefly. The specification or location of a perspective cannot be neatly distinguished from the distortion of the perspective. In the last analysis, a perspective other than one's own is scarcely distinguishable from a distorted one. There would be some room for this distinction if the concept of ideological</page><page sequence="5">37 thought had been defined only in terms of subconscious influences. Professor Stark, however, adds sectional, or class interests also. Now while it might somehow be possible to distinguish a perspective de termined by the subconscious of a thinker from one determined by his social position, it seems impossible to differentiate between the latter and one determined by his class or sectional interest. We are thus thrown back on the third distinction between the theory of ideology and the sociology of knowledge. The social theory of knowledge according to Professor Stark is concerned primarily with "concretization" or crystallization of thought and not with its validity. This is essentially the position of Scheler whose version of the sociology of knowledge Professor Stark generally accepts and tries to carry forward. By crystallization is meant, in fact, the spe cific theory of social knowledge which Professor Stark has attempted to enunciate. Since we cannot obviously examine that theory syste matically at this point, the full force of our criticism can be felt only towards the end of the essay. Here let us examine the fundamental point of this theory: There are certain axiological a priori. They are constitutive of human thought. An example of such an axiological a priori is the radical change in Man's attitude and the quality of his love for Na ture which occurred at the beginning of the modern age and which underlies the entire Modern World-view. The sociology of know ledge will discover, analyse, and trace the necessary interrelations between this world-view and society. As Professor Stark himself aptly puts it, "the sociology of knowledge deals with the formation of a specific world-view, the doctrine of ideology with its deforma tion (1958 : 51). Now the distinction between the formation and deformation of a specific world view is beset with serious difficulties. We shall not raise the problem of finding the value-standard, the "grammar" or "logic", according to which a world-view will be judged as (well) formed or deformed. Assuming that this can be done, the next ques tion is: What are the implications of the deformation of a world view? It should be clear that a deformed world-view is still a world view, and not part of one. Historically, therefore, it can arise only after the well-formed world-view has disintegrated and disappeared. Now in relation to knowledge and thought its role will externally be the same as that of a world-view proper. Since the central task of the sociology of knowledge in Professor Stark's version is not the dis covery and critique of these world-views, but the investigation of its</page><page sequence="6">88 relation with the knowledge and social relations of that epoch, the distinction between the sociology of knowledge and a theory of ideo logy which studies a deformed world-view is not tenable on this ground. The other possibility is that the deformed world-view coexists with a world-view proper. In this case also, one cannot maintain a distinction between the sociology of knowledge and the theory of ideology; for in so far as the study of a world-view, an 'a priori' axio logical system, necessarily includes the study of its changes and vari ants, the theory of ideology becomes its integral part. All that Pro fessor Stark can take as demonstrated is that the theory of ideology does not constitute the whole of the sociology of knowledge. It may be said, however, that the words formation and deforma tion stand not for types of structures, but for processes. We did not discuss this possibility because this leads to even worse results. If the deformation is a process that goes on after a certain time when a world-view has been formed, the unavoidable result of this pro cess will be to disintegrate and finally destroy it. Two possibilities are there. Either a new process of the formation of a world-view will start or the deforming process itself will crystallize into a world view (excluding, of course, the possibility of a complete vacuum). If deformation is regarded as a process leading towards the disso lution of an existing world-view, it becomes a necessary step in the formation of the next world-view—and not merely in a formal, dia lectical but also in a sociological sense, for the set of social relation ships that leads to the dissolution of an existing world-view would also be favourable to the reception of the one that replaces the dis solved one. This remains true even if the replacing world-view is not made up of the deformed ideas. It is not unlikely, however, that Professor Stark would regard this whole discussion as a misunderstanding on our part. Perhaps his main point is that the theory of ideology dealing with distortions is essenntially a psychological discipline and hence should be dis tinguished from the sociology of knowledge which should be both sociological and deal with knowledge not error. A world-view means a system of ideas mostly at a very high level of abstraction in terms of which the entire life (experience and action) and thought of man are organised. It is natural that in any human group it should have universal acceptance, implicit or expli cit. This is, however, not logically necessary and a world-view re</page><page sequence="7">39 mains a world-view whether accepted by one man, the entire group or a minority or no one at a given time. Now Professor Stark thinks that a ideological thinking (and hence the deformation of a world view) concerns certain individuals. This is quite clear from his illus tration of the coincidence in the views of Plato and Pareto on change. He tries to show that, contrary to appearances, this coincidence in one of the basic aspects of their thought is psychological and not sociological. I shall not scrutinize this particular example; instead, I shall urge a fundamental logical argument. If the misunderstand ing of reality or a world-view (Professor Stark's shift from world view to reality is itself significant) is in the minds of some individuals and concerns them only, it is certainly correct to hold that it should be the concern of abnormal psychology—since these distortions of the consciousness are, ex hypothesi, marginal to the society in which they occur. For two reasons, however, this cannot be regarded as a correct representation of the situation. One is that in so far as the sociologist of thought would not normally be concerned with the thought of those who show neither extraordinary intellectual power nor wide influence, it follows that the distortions are social pheno mena by virtue either of their (Symbolic) significance or of their gene ral acceptance and influence, or both. The second and more funda mental reason is that a world-view is the foundation of an indivi dual's thinking—nay, of his very experience. A distortion in the very foundation cannot be merely an individual defect; misunder standing of a world-view, as distinguished from failure to understand or partial understanding, involves the falsification of one's entire consciousness. Barring the cases where this is plainly pathological, which is certainly not the concern of the theory of ideology, this means that the causes of such deformation can never be individual. Global factors—though often incipient—always underlie the occur rence of such a phenomenon. Profesor Stark himself provides for this development when he describes the process of ideology-forma tion in terms of subconscious influences. Once these are admitted it is arbitrary not to admit the collective unconscious, since, as we have just seen, the understanding of a world-view is never an exclu sively individual affair. Marx and Mannheim were thus profoundly right in recognizing in the phenomenon of "false consciousness" as the fundamental problem of what they called the theory of Ideology and the sociology of knowledge respectively. It should, however, be equally clear that within the frame-work of fundamental principles of Marx—which is shared by Weber, Mannheim, and Stark—no solution of the problem is possible. In fact, the very concept of "false consciousness" is an anomaly in such</page><page sequence="8">40 a system: Professor Stark must have seized on this fact, this is the reason why he is so keen on excluding the theory of ideology from the sociology of knowledge—thus eliminating from the very start the problem of false consciousness. However, as we have seen, this attempt does not succeed. We have examined Professor Stark's conception of the sociology of know ledge in so far as he distinguishes it from a generalized theory of ideology; we may now have a brief look at the positive aspects of his conceptions. In the first place, he holds that behind divergent attitudes and thought-systems there are some 'ultimate common fundamentals of thought' (1958, 98) and it is these which properly speaking should be the concern of the sociology of knowledge. Now in what sense is the study of these sociological? The study of ideas and their basic presuppositions is a logico-dialectical investigation: the sociological element can enter here as the genetic explanation of these 'common fundamentals of thought'. Alternatively, they (ideas) may be re garded as the correlate of a social system. It will be readily seen that if the entrance of metatheoretical elements into knowledge be regarded as the essence of the sociology of knowledge, only the first view is admissible. Professor Stark's system of concepts, however, is open to a serious objection: since the world-view or the ultimate common fundamentals of thought are constitutive of the system of social relationships, the latter cannot be used to explain the genesis (or validity) of the world-view. Profesor Stark, accordingly it seems, emphasises the second aspect. But here, too, there are serious diffi culties beneath the smooth surface, though these have been carefully sorted out and examined in the latter part of his Treatise. Even so, the basic objection is that if the two are independent and parallel, the sociology of knowledge is either a descriptive discipline, or the connections discovered by it are just imputed; for if they are real, the sociology of knowledge is itself an overarching system to which no social system is correlated. The true nature of these difficulties comes out very clearly when we consider the specific instance Professor Stark gives of the subject matter of the sociology of knowledge. Following Max Scheler, Pro fessor Stark thinks that modern social organization as also all modern thought originates from a fundamental shift in man's attitude towards nature: . . the most classical expression and applications of the theory we owe to the genius of Max Scheler. His prime example is the origin of the modern world-view—that inclusive thought-struc</page><page sequence="9">41 ture which has been the basis of all realistic thinking since the Re naissance, and which as Scheler has shown, has sprung from an under lying a priori will—and value-structure centred upon the desire to dominate the material world. Ά sociological law of knowledge which comes to the surface in the origin of modern science,' he (Scheler) writes, 'is. . . the way in which the amateur comes before the ex pert, dilettantism before scientific bureaucracy, love before know ledge. Each new objective realm which science has conquered in her history, has had first to be seized in an access of affection : only then could there supervene an age of sober and intellectually more objective research. A new natural science presupposes for this reason a new feeling for nature—a new valuation of nature. This emo tional break-through takes place in the European renaissances begin ning with the renaissance of the Franciscan movement (which is still wholly tied to the terms of Christianity) and its successors, but be coming more and more secularized (Telesio, Campanella, Leonardo, Petrarch, Giordano Bruno, Spinoza, Shaftesbury, Fenelon upto Rous seau) ... It would be an erroneous interpretation of the forces which have overcome the anthropomorphism of the medieval world-view to regard them only, or even primarily, so far as time-order is con cerned as the outcome of rational thinking. To think—that is pre cisely what the Schoolmen could do more acutely and sharply, more artfully and methodically than the bulk of all the modern genera tions of scientists. Initially, it was rather an orgiastic and ecstatic, emotional surrender to nature and a new experimential attitude which brought an opening-up of the mind towards the world . . . which led beyond bookish knowledge and narrow anthropomorphism . . "This new love of nature which, in contradiction of the well known adage, made men attentive to her true character, rather than blind to it, was not like the Christian agape which demands the passive surrender of the lover to the loved one, but resembled rather the heathen eros with its active desire to appropriate, to have and to hold her. For this reason domination became the decisive axiological element, the central value-attitude, from which the study of reality was undertaken, and which, in the fullness of time, was to lead to the integral modern world -view."2 We have quoted at length in order to give a fair idea of what Professor Stark thinks to be the essence of the sociology of knowledge. This was all the more essential in view of the fact that we have de 2. Op. cit., pp. 114-5.</page><page sequence="10">42 voted considerable space to what the presentation of the sociology of knowledge is not according to Professor Stark. To any careful reader who is not already convinced about the matter, this account will look highly unsatisfactory and will raise a number of important difficulties. In the first place, he will notice that the above statement is not wholly consistent with that appearing on page 98. There it is said that certain "common fundamentals of thought" were the proper concern of the sociology of knowledge. From the later passage, however, it will appear that the study of certain emotional mutations and consequent emergence of value structures is its proper subject matter. This does not go well with the earlier statement because these emotional 'breakthroughs' and a priori axiological elements, are admittedly neither thought nor ra tional. However, it may be held that the sociology of knowledge is more concerned with the fundamentals of thought than with emo tional shifts through which they crystallize. This will not settle the issue and the sociology of knowledge on this account, will have to be centrally concerned with the 'emotional', 'irrational forces' behind 'common fundamentals of thought' on pain of being indistinguishable from a pure (or idealistic) history of ideas. This in other words means that the sociology of knowledge has to be based on a history of human consciousness. This history, if we accept Scheler's ideas as adopted by Professor Stark, will have to be at the same time, a his tory of the humn unconscious even though to us that is unintelligible except in the sense of a study of traditional symbols and archetypes : but that will not fit in with any modern conception of the sociology of knowledge. If on the other hand, this history and also the en suing history of ideas is interpreted autonomously, theoretical socio logy of knowledge is eliminated altogether. It will thus be seen that within a humanistic and tacitly positivistic frame of reference, the Scheler-Stark conception of the sociology of knowledge cannot avoid being an investigation of the non-rational and (collective) unconsci ous roots and presuppositions of human thought. Professor Stark is, of course, well-aware of the paradoxes and perplexities into which Marx and Mannheim (and Pareto) involved themselves by including the study of ideological thought in their purview. But it should be clear that Professor Stark cannot avoid them merely by calling these non-rational emotional (or volitional) factors a priori axiological ele ments. For if α priori means independent of experience, then these volitional or emotional mutations are obviously not a priori. Nor are they in any way the principles without which the process of va luations can be ultimately understood only in terms of the changed attitude to nature; in other words, it is an a priori valuation in the</page><page sequence="11">43 sense that it is the ultimate common presupposition of all modem value systems. But even this will not do. It is beset with a number of diffi culties which cannot be easily brushed aside. Firstly, it is admitted that the change in man's attitude to Nature developed in opposition to the preceding non-modern (Traditional) attitude. It represents a point in a historical series. And hence there is no reason to call it the ultimate presupposition of our self-understanding. Whether or not it may be ultimately possible to give an intelligible answer to the question : Why does a change in man's basic attitudes take place?— it is certainly not nonsensical to raise this question about the change from the ancient-traditional to the modern world-view. In fact, such a question has been asked and answered; and Professor Stark him self, in the last analysis, assigns this very task to the sociology of knowledge. Surprisingly, however, he does not adequately realise the implications. The traditional world-view already envisages these fundamental changes in human consciousness it has a systematic theory to aid its understanding, namely the theory according to which these changes are, in the last analysis, levels of theoretic consciousness, and repre sent a dialectic of knowledge and modes of its obscuration. The fun damental principle underlying this view is admitted even by Pro fessor Stark when he speaks of an axiological system. It would be strange if an axiological system, however axiomatic, were not a sys tem of knowledge. In fact, Scheler's antithesis between love and knowledge denies the concept of an a priori axiology; in any case it already presupposes a theory according to which the proposition, 'Love is a form of knowledge' or 'Love is a cognitive virtue' is false. One is thus faced with the problem of self-reference of the socio logy of knowledge (and the consequent doubt whether a "sociology" of knowledge is possible)—a problem which traditional thought straightly recognizes and answers. Professor Stark sidesteps this cru cial problem by considering another instead. As if aware of his im plicit confusion between a theory of the primacy of the will (or life) and an a priori axiological system (sans Supratemporal reference) he asks : "If knowledge is indeed, as we have asserted, genetically con nected with a pre-existent axiological or value-system, are not its sources hopelessly contaminated in consequence? Must not the pre sence of any value (or ought'-conception) bar the way to truth, pre judice our pursuit of the truth (or our conception of the 'Is')? Is not value-determined knowledge—paradoxically—value-less?"</page><page sequence="12">44 He then goes on to assert: "Happily, we can answer this ques tion (which has led people like Karl Mannheim into considerable diffi culties) with a most emphatic negative. Our sociology of know ledge assumes the necessity of certain pre-judgments with regard to the relative importance or unimportance of the numberless separable and eligible strands of objective reality, manageable object of know ledge out of the indeterminate and immeasurable materials of know ledge would not be possible; but it does not assert the necessity— indeed, it manifestly suggests the non-necessity—of prejudices."3 In support of this general "emphatic" answer, Professor Stark adds three specific arguments : "Firstly, the values which the socio logy of knowledge sees established at the basis of our own, or any other, concrete world-view, are objective values, value-facts, not sub jective valuations. They are given in and by the life of the society concerned and exist and are operative before any individual member of that society can ever possibly form or assert any private prejudice of his own. They inhere in and help to constitute the basic pattern of human interaction at the time and place in question, and have for the individual that externality and objectivity which Durkheim rightly claims to be one of the hallmarks of social fact. "Secondly, and more importantly, though the axiological system determines what is to be selected from the materials of knowledge for inclusion in the objects or object of knowledge, it does not and cannot determine, how this selection is to be carried out. "Thirdly, and lastly, our sociology of knowledge, properly handled, can lead to an objectivity in the treatment of social and historical reality incomparably deeper than any achieved or attain able by those who deny the existence and the influence of a basic axiological layer in the human mind."4 If the above defence of his position is examined with the minute care and logical rigour due to formulations of a scholar of Professor Stark's calibre, one comes up against a series of complications. First, it is not clear whether the "numberless separable and eligible strands of objective reality" are "separable" and "eligible" and "objective" by virtue of the "prejudgments with regard to relative importance and unimportance" or whether they have these qualities intrinsically. The former alternative will mean that these "prejudgments" are the basic 3. Op. cit., p. 126. 4. Op. cit., pp. 126-7.</page><page sequence="13">45 categorical forms of our cognitive process. If they are one and the same for all peoples and ages and constitutive of social life, they can not evidently be identical with the axiological a priori with which the sociology of knowledge deals. But this will render the "axiolo gical layer" wholly arbitrary, in which case a fresh set of "prejudg ments" will be required to explain the formation of this axiological layer; and even if it (the axiological layer) is held to be a kind of self-generating "substance", the question of its relation with the "pre judgments" will have to be settled. On the other hand, if the "prejudgments" represent the "axiolo gical layer of the human mind" and are culture-bound, a relativity is introduced in the very heart of the cognitive process. Perhaps this kind of relativism is admitted by Profesor Stark, for he regards it as quite harmless (He commends Scheler's theory of the relatively "natural" world-view). But he has not been able to provide any logical argument for the ens universale which the differing and even conflicting world-views certainly imply if they are to be meaningful but for which the method and presuppositions of the sociology of knowledge (even in Scheler's version) leave no logical room whatso ever. The knowledge of the alternative world-view must be trans cendental, but this problem Professor Stark simply ignores. His other three points are still more difficult to understand. He says that the values which form the basis of a world-view are 'objective'; they are not simply values but 'value-facts'. It is only fair to assume that this is another way of putting the idea of an axiological a priori. We have examined it already. Does this alternative formulation clarify it any further? The best construction, we should think, is to under stand it to mean that these "Values" represent not individual but col lective evaluations. It will also seem that, in an important sense, they are unconscious too. This is the only way perhaps of under standing Professor Stark's second point where he draws a distinction between prejudice and prejudgment— two words whose etymology is the same. It is obvious that prejudice here means an individualized prejudgment. The alternative interpretation is to think in terms of the eternal truth and its temporal manifestations and modalities. This indeed seems to be the model for Professor Stark's own thinking. But he never commits himself to it; on the contrary, he is anxious all along to avoid it. At the same time he does not like to make his sociology of knowledge a study of hidden distortions of thought, though re peatedly his positions lead us to a point where it is practically syno nymous with the study of collective unconscious forces.</page><page sequence="14">46 Professor Stark obviously holds that whatever is not individual or is superindividual is social—a fallacy he inherits from Durkheim. But the collective—the Mass and the public—are not individual phe nomena, they are super-individual. And yet it is accepted that a mass, a crowd is not a society. A distortion does not cease to be one by being collective, or public. It is this false identification of the social with the collective that should explain the very odd position which Professor Stark takes when he says that the values at the basis of a world-view are constitutive of the pattern of human interaction though it is the same human interaction which throws them up. And further, while they are them selves the product of this interaction, they are the ultimate guiding principles, for articulating knowledge of reality. The study of world-views and their formation emerges as the essence of the sociology of knowledge. Curiously, Professor Stark tends to avoid ontological and methodological questions. That is, such questions as : is there an absolute of which the divergent world-views are modalities? What is the status of the knowledge that comprises the understanding of all world-views? Is it not self-referring? Is such universal knowledge possible at all? But these are the ques tions that such a view necessarily raises. (To be continued)</page></plain_text>
