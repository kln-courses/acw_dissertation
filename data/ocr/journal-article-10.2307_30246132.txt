Intriguing similarities between geo- metric design styles of the Hohokam and Trincheras areas are used to suggest when and how contacts were made. We present a method for documenting stylistic similarity in an unbiased manner by comparing primary design structure and design symmetry. This approach identifies aspects of shared design style and assesses its significance. The study compares petroglyphs from the Trincheras area with painted ceramic designs from the Hohokam area. Ideas concerning regional organizational development toward social complexity, initiated from analyses of shell remains, also are evaluated. RESUMEN Atraves del andlisis estilistico del arte cerdmico y rupestre se han documen- tado los acrecentados contactos que existieron entre las comunidades Hohokam del sur de Arizona y las comunidades Trincheras del noroeste de Sonora. Intrigantes similitudes entre los estilos de diseiios geometricos de dreas Hohokam y Trincheras son usados para sugerir cuando y como se hicieron los contactos. Presentamos un metodo imparcial para documentar similitudes estilisticas comparando la simetria y estructura elemental de los disefios. Este enfoque identifica aspectos de estilos de disen-os que com- parten y avalua su significado. Este estudio compara petroglifos del drea Trincheras con disefios de la cerdmica pintada del drea Hohokam. Tambidn se evaluan ideas, iniciadas con los andlisis de restos de moluscos, re- lacionadas con el desarrollo de la organizacidn regional hacia la com- plejidad social. The southern extent of Hohokam cultural traditions and influences is not clear (Fish 1989: Fig. 3) and may well have varied over time due to differing intensities of contact. Increased contacts between the Hohokam communities in southern Arizona and Trincheras communities in northwestern Sonora have been suggested (Bowen 1972; McGuire and Villalpando 1989), and now can be supported through stylistic analysis of rock and ceramic art. This shared art style provides independent evidence for regional economic ties previously deduced from marine shell exchange and shell ornament production. 319</page><page sequence="2">320 LINDAUER AND ZASLOW California SPhoenix L River I Basin '~4, i Hohokam '",a !I Region I Trincheras Region Cerros Calera Gulf of California_ Baja California, Mexico 0 50 100 Mi1es Figure 1.

By limiting our concept of stylistic similarity to particu- lar aspects of shared design style we can assess its significance. A series of both simple and complex geometric patterns are compared to (1) identify patterns that are significant indicators of close contacts, and to (2) suggest the nature of contacts from the context (material, manufacture, location within a site) of the designs. BACKGROUND Hohokam and Trincheras Cultures The Hohokam culture area is located in southern Arizona, mainly in the areas centered on and surrounding the modern cities of Phoenix and Tucson along the lower Salt and Gila River drainages (Figure 1). Its material culture is extensively documented from many locations including the site of Snake- town (Gladwin and others 1937; Haury 1976). This was a society of agricul- turalists who practiced various forms of irrigation agriculture, produced distinctive red-on-buff pottery, lived mainly in semi-subterranean pit struc- tures, built ballcourts and, later, platform mounds as public architecture. The area of the Trincheras culture lies immediately to the south in north- ern Sonora, along the Magdalena, Altar, and Concepcifon drainages (Figure 1). Whether this culture is separate from, or a regional variant of, Hohokam culture is uncertain. Haury (1950:547-548) and Johnson (1963:182-185) in- clude it with the Hohokam, while DiPeso (1979:158) and Braniff (1985) re- gard it as a separate tradition. Recent survey information (McGuire and Villalpando 1989:167) suggests that Trincheras culture was distinct during its early stages (perhaps until A.D. 1300) and part of a southern Arizona tradi- tion in the later prehistoric period. Differences in the early stages of Trin- cheras culture include the use of reddish pottery made by a coil-and-scrape technique, the lack of Hohokam traits such as ballcourts, censors, and pal- ettes, and the presence of non-Hohokam chili grinders, drop-ended manos, and narrow metates. Later, Trincheras pottery is a polished paddle-and-anvil brownware, and decorated wares identical to those found in southern Ari- zona are imported. Shell Exchange and Ornament Production McGuire and Villalpando (1989:166-167) recognize that the use of shell is linked to similarities between Trincheras and Hohokam cultures. Contacts that took place from as early as A.D. 700 apparently centered around the shell trade. It was the Hohokam need for shell raw material that enabled the</page><page sequence="4">322 LINDAUER AND ZASLOW Trincheras to serve as suppliers (Haury 1976:306). This may have been the reason why, in later times, aspects of Trincheras and Hohokam cultures be- came less distinct. The structure and organization of Hohokam shell exchange has recently been re-evaluated by McGuire and Howard (1987). They contrast, before and after the Hohokam Classic period, (1) the ways in which shell raw mate- rial was obtained, (2) the scale and location of shell ornament production, and (3) the role or meaning of shell ornaments in Hohokam society. These changes correspond with others that result from the development of local elites or inter-community leaders in the Hohokam region. It is proposed that social changes, though not to the same degree, were also taking place in the Trincheras region. During the Colonial and Sedentary periods, the center of Hohokam shell production was the western Papagueria. The Hohokam of the western Papa- gueria obtained raw shell by expeditions to the northern Gulf of California coast. Isolated or grouped petroglyphs at what may have been trails and camp sites were created during this period (Hayden 1972). The shell indus- try in the agriculturally marginal western Papagueria provided a means to obtain food resources from the Gila Bend and Phoenix Basin areas by offer- ing finished shell ornaments as exchange items (McGuire and Howard 1987: 130). During most of this time shell artifacts were broadly distributed among all Hohokam sites with generally unrestricted access. During the late Sedentary period, however, there is evidence that differ- ential access to shell existed. McGuire and Howard (1987:126) point to evi- dence that certain individuals in large villages may have been responsible for importing shell and may have had preferential access to shell artifacts. Evidence from Snaketown indicates leaders could have controlled shell pro- duction (Seymour 1988). McGuire and Howard (1987) propose that two lev- els of shell value existed during the late Sedentary and Classic periods - low value for items such as bracelets, beads, and pendants, and high value for items such as trumpets and shell mosaics. Howard (1983) found that shell ornament production during the Classic period ceased to be centered in the Papaguerfa and became more common in the Phoenix and Tucson basins. Large communities that developed during the Classic period probably had leaders who utilized shell production to en- hance their position both within their own community and among other communities. Thus, it became necessary for leaders to establish contacts with Trincheras communities in northern Sonora in order to gain access to shell raw materials. Indeed, quantitative studies of raw and finished shell ar- tifacts found at Hohokam sites (Howard 1983, 1985) indicate that interre- gional trade during the late Sedentary and Classic periods involved mostly raw materials rather than finished artifacts. The hypothesis proposed by</page><page sequence="5">Homologous Style Structures 323 McGuire and Howard (1987:134) to account for this shift is that Hohokam "elites" gained control of both production and distribution during the Classic period. Shell raw material could have been collected by western Papagueria Hohokam during expeditions to the Gulf of California. Phoenix and Tucson Basin Hohokam, on the other hand, probably followed rivers into the Trincheras heartland in order to gain access to shell raw material. The Trincheras access route was probably developed during the late Sedentary period and persisted into the Classic period. Trade contacts may have been informal at first, but a constant need for raw materials may have necessitated formalization of contacts, and even the marking of territories or creation of alliances. Symbolic markings by Hohokam "elite" that would indicate the existence of an established trade might be expected in a public setting near the Trincheras trade community. Rock art containing such symbolic mark- ings would conveniently indicate a trade alliance. Thus, the likelihood is high that the symbolic markings would signal Hohokam affiliation and elite social group association. These symbolic markings should be different from the Trincheras design repertoire, as they come from outside the region. a b~ Figure 2.

In- deed, Hayden (1972) and Haury (1976:300) postulate that Hohokam indi- viduals travelled over petroglyph-marked trails from the Phoenix Basin to the Gulf of California (see also McGuire and Howard 1987:113-114). Com- parisons of design styles that document contacts have been conducted by others (Lumholtz 1912; Hayden 1972; Schaafsma 1980; McGuire and Vil- lalpando 1989:167). Our focus is not only to document identical styles in Hohokam and Trincheras areas, but to use style to estimate the time-range of contact. The decorative tradition of Hohokam art is well documented from num- erous whole decorated ceramics from different Hohokam time periods. Whole decorated Trincheras ceramics, by contrast, are extremely rare; thus, a detailed comparison of Hohokam and Trincheras ceramic decorations is a b Figure 3. Rotated and mirrored decorations. a, Trincheras petroglyph (Ballereau 1988:45, Fig. 7b); b, Hohokam bowl from the Gila Bend area (Lindauer 1987:No. 3374); c(1), Trincheras petroglyph (Ballereau 1988:47, Fig. 17c); c(2), Trincheras petroglyph (Ballereau 1988:44, Fig. 3e).</page><page sequence="7">Homologous Style Structures 325 not currently possible.Trincheras petroglyphs, however, are abundant. Re- cently, a large number of petroglyphs from the Trincheras sites of Cerros La Proveedora and Calera were recorded by Ballereau (1987,1988) and Baller- eau and others (1987). As a group, these petroglyphs are more sophisticated than Hohokam petroglyphs (compare Schaafsma 1980 and Carrico 1984). Their diversity and complexity not only warrant examination, but make a comparative study of Trincheras rock art and Hohokam ceramic art possible. Many anthropomorphic and biomorphic figures are observed among the Trincheras petroglyphs and some of the rock panels appear to record events, or to signal or store information. In addition, substantial numbers of Trin- cheras petroglyphs show geometrical order, including many that demon- strate repetition at regular intervals in given directions (Figure 2). The design in Figure 2a (Ballereau 1988:65, Fig. 23c) illustrates only a single di- rection of repetition; decorative patterns having this property are usually called bands, strips or friezes. Patterns with repetition in two independent di- rections (Figure 2b)(Ballereau 1988:48, Fig. 21g) are often called wallpaper patterns. It is the band and wallpaper patterns in Trincheras rock panels that 0 b d e ~~j/~ f/iit  Figure 4. Reference line structures: schemata a through I.</page><page sequence="8">326 LINDAUER AND ZASLOW correlate with Hohokam ceramic art, and in many instances, are very distinc- tive. Hohokam petroglyphs, by contrast, are not generally organized with respect to repetition over regular intervals along given directions and, there- fore, are not amenable to comparative analysis. Rock and ceramic art are produced by different methods and function in different social contexts. The way in which pottery is manufactured, used, and stored heavily influences the selection of painted designs placed on it. Specifically, how the fields of design are visible in day-to-day contexts is significant. Ceramic bowls and jars are usually built for upright positioning, and decorative characteristics are either parallel or perpendicular to the hori- 0 b d e Figure 5.

Rock art production involves chipping away desert varnish to expose the lighter color of the rock base. Hence, accessibility of smooth sections of a boulder and boundaries of these sections become important factors in ori- enting a decoration. In addition, a boulder may have occasionally tilted be- cause of weathering at a time after the petroglyph was made (Wallace and Holmlund 1986:163-170). Thus, in comparing Hohokam ceramic designs with Trincheras petroglyphs, one must be alert to the possibility of rotated whole patterns. Both Figure 3a, a pattern on a Trincheras boulder (Ballereau 1988:45, Fig. 7b) and Figure 3b, which depicts a bowl from the Gila Bend area (Lindauer 1987:No. 3374) are positioned relative to horizontal ground level. Figure 3a needs only to be rotated by about 90 degrees clockwise in order to verify that the petroglyph and bowl utilize the same line structure. Line structures that show repetition at regular intervals in a single direc- tion can frequently be identified in Hohokam and Trincheras band and wall- paper patterns. Some significant line structures are listed in Figure 4a-1. These line structures are the basic units of comparison used throughout this article and are referred to repeatedly. Line structure b is present in Figures 3a and b, while line structure g is present in Figure 2a and b. The mirror im- () ) b C 0 00 III IIIIII a IIIIIIII I II II 0 0 0 1,111 0 11111iiilll Figure 6.

For example, Figures 3c(1) and (2) dis- play the mirror image of line structure b. Our study incorporates ideas from Jernigan (1982, 1986) who compared design schemata in developing a non-hierarchical approach to design analy- sis. In this paper, each line structure in Figure 4, plus its mirror image, con- stitute a design schema. In addition to comparing schemata in band and wallpaper patterns from the Trincheras and Hohokam areas, our study exam- ines the sequencing of line structures within wallpaper patterns. We argue that shared schemata and shared methods for sequencing line structures are evidence of a mingling of cultural ideas among contemporary groups, if not the actual presence of one group working in the area of another. COMPARISONS In as much as line structures are basic building blocks of many Trin- cheras and Hohokam patterns, they are natural candidates for comparison. The following text documents similar examples of line structures from the Trincheras and Hohokam areas, points out relationships among line struc- tures, and classifies whole patterns in terms of component line structures. Some patience in resolving wallpaper patterns into line structures may be needed when schemata are observed in compact arrangements. Sketching or tracing line structures is often a practical aid in pattern resolution. Schemata a and b We start with the line structures illustrated in Figures 4a and b, which differ only minimally. The short line segments of line structure a that are absent from line structure b often serve to initiate scrolls. Examples of Trin- a b Figure 7.

Trincheras petroglyphs displaying line structure a are shown in Figures 5a and b (Ballereau 1988:48, Figs. 20b and 45, Fig. 7a). Comparable Hohokam decorations are illustrated in Figures 5c and d (Gladwin and others 1937: Plate 157f; Haury 1976:Fig. 11.9f). Figures 5a and c lack decorative elabora- tion; rotation of Figure 5c by about 45 degrees counterclockwise emphasizes the similarity of these two figures. Solid filler and scrolls are added to line structure in Figures 5b and d and are lacking in Figure 5e. Schemata c, d, and e If Figures 5a and c were photographic prints, their photographic nega- tives would be black where the prints are white and clear where the prints are black. Thus, in negative, the background becomes the design. Although Figures 5a and c display line structure a (Figure 4), their negatives demon- strate line structure c (Figure 4). Figure 3b has a negative that approximates line structure d (Figure 4). It is important to note that schemata c, d, and e (Figure 4) occur in both Hohokam and Trincheras decorations. Examples of Hohokam decorations that employ line structures c, d, and e in positive are illustrated in Figures 6a, b and c, respectively. Trincheras counterparts are illustrated in Figures 6d, e and f. Figure 6f contains line structure d in the space between two other line structures. b do( Figure 8. Schemata f and g displayed in selected Trincheras (a, b) and Hohokam (c, d) decorations.</page><page sequence="12">330 LINDAUER AND ZASLOW The sequence of line structures: d, b, d, b... The Trincheras petroglyph (Carrico 1984:Fig. 9) shown in Figure 7a vertically extends Figure 6f. Figure 7 can be interpreted as two interpen- etrating patterns. One of these interpenetrating patterns (Figure 7b) is based on line structure b (Figure 4); the other (Figure 7c) utilizes line structure d (Figure 4). Line structures b and d alternate in Figure 7a, so that line struc- ture b represents contours within Figure 7c, while at the same time line structure d represents contours within Figure 7b. Figure 7a is a highly dis- tinctive and well-executed example of aesthetic geometry. Some Hohokam counterparts to Figures 6f and 7a are discussed below. Schemata f, g, and h Referring again to Figure 4, one can observe that the deletion of sections of line from line structures e and c yields line structures f and g, respec- tively. Thus, the continuous curvilinear and interlocking scrolls of line struc- ture e become discontinuous interlocking scrolls in line structure f. Line structures f and g exemplify the general correspondence between curvilinear and rectilinear design styles, as do line structures e and c. Trincheras petro- glyphs utilizing schemata f and g are presented in the patterns of Figure 2 and Figures 8a and b (Ballereau 1988:48, Fig. 22d and 65, Fig. 26h) while related Hohokam constructions are shown in Figures 8c and d (Haury 1976: Fig. 11; Gladwin and others 1937:Fig. 69e and P1. 145h). Likewise, removal of a line segment in the repeat unit of line structure b yields line structure h. Schemata h often frames the top and/or the bottom of Trincheras and Hohokam decorations. The successive application of schema h to create wallpaper patterns is observed on a Trincheras rock panel (Bal- lereau 1988:46, Fig. 13b) and a decorated Hohokam jar (Hammack and Sullivan 1981:Fig. 104d). Schemata i and j Line structure i (Figure 4) is clearly depicted by the Hohokam decora- tion shown in Figure 9a (Lindauer 1987:No. 3080). Rudimentary interlock- ing scrolls are placed at regular intervals between two parallel lines that form a band envelope. All line segments that initiate the scrolls are perpen- dicular to the band envelope. The mirror image of line structure i is observed in Figure 9b (Lindauer 1987:No. 3078), another Hohokam decoration; Fig- ure 9c clarifies Figure 9b by removing irregularity in the band envelope and some decorative elaboration. A Trincheras petroglyph that utilizes the mirror image of line structure i is illustrated in Figure 9d (Ballereau 1988:48, Fig. 21h), while another Trincheras petroglyph (Figure 9e) (Ballereau 1988:45, Fig. 7b), displays a curvilinear version of line structure i.</page><page sequence="13">Homologous Style Structures 331 Figure 9f (Ballereau 1988:45, Fig. 8b) displays a characteristic not present in any of the wallpaper patterns illustrated in Figures 5 through 8. Both line structure i and its mirror image are present in Figure 9f. Moreover, the two mirror images alternate in the adjacent bands that comprise the deco- ration. By contrast, the line structures of all of the wallpaper patterns in Figure 5 through 8 exhibit but one mirror orientation in each figure. Another way to describe Figure 9f is by means of line structure j. Both line structure j and its mirror image alternate successively in Figure 9f. The presence of a line structure and its mirror image in an alternating sequence is a distinctive decorative characteristic that is found in both Trincheras and Hohokam patterns.

The situation parallels that observed in comparing line structures a and b, where the short line segments of line structure a often initiate scrolls. Likewise, the short line segments of line structure k might also initiate scrolls. Figures 10a and b (Ballereau 1988:46, Fig. 13a and 48, Fig. 22b) are Trincheras petroglyphs that exhibit line structure k, while a Hohokam petro- glyph from the Tucson Basin is shown in Figure 10c (Wallace and Holm- lund 1986:183, Fig. A-19). Figure 10d (Ballereau 1988:section of 47, Fig. 17g) illustrates a Trincheras petroglyph having schema 1. Many Hohokam painted ceramics utilize schema k and schema 1, as well (Figure 11). In order to clarify the original Hohokam diagrams, only three line struc- tures are illustrated in Figures 1 la (Wasley and Johnson 1965:Fig. 64) and 1 lb (Lindauer 1987:No. 3382). Furthermore, elaborative details are omitted from Figures 11 a and 1 c(l) (Haury 1976:Fig. 19a). Line structure k alter- nates sequentially with its mirror image in Figures 11 a and b, and line struc- ture 1 exhibits the same mirror reversal in Figure 11 c(1). The schemata j, k, and I (Figure 4) display the same symmetry, namely, glide symmetry, and they are observed in wallpaper patterns that demonstrate mirror reversal. Introducing schema a into decorations initiated by schema k A portion of a Trincheras rock panel is shown in Figure 12 (Ballereau 1987:Fig. 21D). The mirror image of line structure a (Figure 4) is introduced into the pattern following line structure k (Figure 4). Starting at the top of a b ~ d Figure 10. Petroglyphs that demonstrate schemata k (a, b, Trincheras; c, Hohokam) and I (d, Trincheras).</page><page sequence="15">Homologous Style Structures 333 Figure 12, the sequence of whole line structures is k, a mirrored, a mirrored, a mirrored. In patterns initiated by line structure k, the expected sequence of line structures would be k, k mirrored, k, k mirrored. The introduction of a mirrored into Figure 12 is possible because the upper parts of line structures k and a are identical. A similar exchange of line structures is observed in the Hohokam ceramic decorations of Figures 13a and b (Gladwin and others 1937:Plates 144h and 145i). In Figure 13a the succession of line structures is k, k mir- rored, a, whereas Figure 13b reveals the sequence k mirrored, a, a. b C (I) () 7 Figure 11.

The principal line work is shown in Figure 1 Ic(1), to which is added the middle of three contours in Figure 11 c(2). Similarities with a Trincheras petroglyph (Figure 7a) reveal that the jar decoration is a Hohokam counter- part to the Trincheras petroglyph. Contouring produces schema d in Figures 7a and 1 lc(2), and pattern initiation is the same in both figures. Schema 1 is found in the Hohokam decoration in lieu of schema b (Figure 4) of the Trincheras petroglyph, but it can be noted that sections of schemata b and 1 are identical. In other Hohokam decorations, such as Figure 14a (Wasley and Johnson 1965:Fig. 56e), line structure k (Figure 4) is utilized for principal line work. Contours representing schema c (Figure 4) are also present. The upper con- tour is isolated in Figure 14b, while Figure 14c records the principal line work. Framing and embellishing decorative patterns: a comparison of Figure 14a with Figures 15b and c A substantial number of Trincheras petroglyphs are framed by two par- allel straight lines or initiated with a single straight line. Patterns of rock art bounded in this way are readily compared to similarly framed Hohokam ce- ramic decorations. Three of these bounded Trincheras petroglyphs are illus- trated in Figures 9d, e and 12. Additional examples are shown in Figure 15 Figure 12.

Figures 15b and c are very much alike with re- spect to primary line structure and positioning.

In Figure 15b, in descending order one finds (1) a part of a line structure, (2) the complete line structure a mirrored, and (3) a part of a line structure. Line structure b is similarly utilized in Figure 15c. Hence the same procedure was used in assembling line structures for Figures 14a, 15b and c. An interchangeability of schemata a and k occurred within the same patterns (Figures 12 and 13). Figures 14a and 15b demon- strate the interchangeability of line structures a and k in different patterns. With respect to elaborative details, Figures 14a, 15b and c fill their up- per and lower triangular areas. Bullseyes are regularly used in Figures 14a and 15c, and a single bullseye appears in Figure 15b. Both the Hohokam decoration (Figure 14a) and the Trincheras petroglyph (Figure 15c) employ the technique of applying a single contour between line structures. A neck decoration is present on the Hohokam jar depicted in Figure 14a, whereas a banded decoration parallel to the upper boundary of the main decoration in Figure 15c can be interpreted as an analog to a neck decoration on a jar.

Figure 16g (Ballereau and others 1987:Plate 16a and Ballereau 1988:63, Fig. 16 e, h) has not been observed by the authors in Hohokam paintings; the figure suggests a netting of rectilinear loops, where each loop interlocks with four adjacent loops. DISCUSSION The Nature of Trincheras Petroglyphs Petroglyphs may serve many functions. They may be geographical markers, describe historical events, have ceremonial purposes, or set down calendrical information (Bruder 1986). Among the petroglyphs at Cerros Calera and La Proveedora are some that record and display aesthetic geom- etries. The presence of these decorations on rock panels in the Trincheras area is fortunate because accessible, painted Trincheras ceramics are too fragmented to allow us to construct whole designs, and textiles and baskets appear to have perished. It is not likely that the geometrical decorations on Trincheras rock pan- els are clan or family markers; the same decorations occur over the entire Hohokam area on ceramics. Although many petroglyphs include channels, they are not mazes (Carrico 1984; Ballereau 1987, 1988); the patterns and, consequently, the channels are repetitive at regular intervals, and could be extended infinitely. A considerable variability is observed in the quality of geometrical petroglyphs. Some of the designs look as though they were con- structed by amateurs and might represent practicing. In this context, petro- glyphs might indicate competition based on artistic skill. Evaluating Comparisons In comparing the petroglyphs from the Trincheras area and Hohokam ceramic decorations, many cross-relationships among the schemata of Fig- ure 4 have been noted. Briefly, these relationships involve curvilinear to rec- tilinear transformations, common symmetry features, loss or addition of line segments, and a sharing of sections of line work. Thus, for example, line structure c is a rectilinear counterpart to line structure e. Schemata j, k and 1 belong to the same symmetry class. Line structure k reduces to line structure I by removal of short line segments. The upper portion of line structure a is identical to the upper portion of line structure k. When the schemata of Figure 4 are placed next to each other to form wallpaper patterns, contouring and positive-to-negative exchange reveal ad- ditional relationships. For example, schema c appears as contours between successive schema a and also between successive schema k. It is extremely unlikely that the schemata of Figure 4, with shared connections, could have developed independently in the Trincheras and Hohokam cultures.</page><page sequence="22">340 LINDAUER AND ZASLOW Figure 16 summarizes Trincheras line constructions not illustrated in Figure 4. Together, the line structures of Figures 4 and 16 are the basis for more than 95 percent of Trincheras bands and wallpaper patterns. But the line structures of Figure 4 are more important in establishing Trincheras- Hohokam linkage than those of Figure 16 because they yield patterns of greater complexity. Any two sets of schemata showing similarities could be used in a comparative study of decoration (Jernigan 1986); however, all schemata are not of equal importance. In determining relative importance of different patterns, one must look at the difficulty implicit in a particular pattern's construction and in reproducing each pattern. How difficult is it to execute a line structure, assemble line structures, and add elaborative detail to complete a decoration? Similarities have more significance when com- plex procedures are shared within a geographical region. For example, a single straight line, such as is seen in Figure 16b, is more easily conceived and copied than line structure k in Figure 4. Likewise, as- sembling straight lines to create Figure 16b is much more easily accom- plished than assembling line structure k in Figure 4 and its mirror image to form Figure 11 b. Because Figure 16b is so much easier to create, it has the greater potential for rapid dissemination throughout a broad geographical re- gion than Figure 1 lb. Thus, with respect to linkage between cultural groups within the region, correlations drawn from the distribution of Figure 11 b would have much more significance than correlations drawn from the distri- bution of Figure 16b. Because distinctive characteristics are common to both Trincheras petroglyphs and Hohokam ceramic designs, the conclusion can be drawn that a shared decorative tradition existed. The following are important shared characteristics: (1) The presence of schemata a (Figure 5) and k (Fig- ures 10 and 11) and their variants schemata b and 1; (2) the exchange of schema a for schema k when sequencing line structures (Figures 12 and 13); (3) the appearance of the negatives of patterns in positive (compare Figures 5a and c with Figures 6a and d); (4) the presence of contours between sche- mata (Figures 7, 1 c, 14a and 15c); (5) line structures and their mirror im- ages in sequence (Figures 9f and 11); and (6) half, whole and half line structures framed by triangular areas with bullseyes (Figures 14, 15b and c). Dating petroglyphs It is generally difficult to date petroglyphs accurately. The few Trincheras ceramics associated with rock art at La Proveedora probably date to the late Sedentary and early Classic periods, about A.D. 1000 to 1200 (Carrico 1984:83-85). Schaafsma (1980:94) suggests that petroglyphs of the Gila Style, including those of the Trincheras area, show little temporal varia-</page><page sequence="23">Homologous Style Structures 341 tion. Within the Hohokam area, pattern distribution varies over time and from one ruin group to another. The schemata of Figure 4 are observed on Hohokam ceramics of the Colonial, Sedentary and early Classic periods; as a group, Trincheras petroglyphs have similarities to Hohokam decorations from all of these time periods. Yet, certain petroglyphs can be cross-dated on the basis of their line structures. Hohokam patterns with line structures a and k neighboring (Fig- ure 13) are specific to the Sedentary period. Their arrangement is difficult to reproduce, and, based on currently available data, appears to be localized to the Trincheras and Hohokam areas. Therefore, it is very likely that the petroglyph of Figure 12 dates between A.D. 900 and 1100. Another petroglyph that can be fixed temporally is shown in Figure 15c. Its Hohokam counterpart, Figure 14a, was painted on a vessel with shape at- tributes of the Classic period: an elongated, decorated neck, and a shoulder that sits relatively higher on the body of the vessel than shoulders from the Sedentary period (Lindauer 1987:No. 3035). However, the sequence of line structures in Figure 14a matches the sequence of line structures in decora- tions from the late Sacaton phase (Gladwin and others 1937:Plate 144a and b). Post-Sacaton decorations with the same principal line work are truncated and distorted relative to Figure 14a (Zaslow 1990). Moreover, Figures 14a and 15c display similar elaborative details, adding to the evidence that the petroglyph of Figure 15c dates to the Sedentary-Classic transition, around A.D. 1100. Hohokam Rock Art in the Context of Hohokam-Trincheras Contacts The intriguing designs at Cerros La Proveedora and Calera may mark a turning point in Trincheras and Hohokam relations. A case has been made that a class of geometric rock art found at a Trincheras site documents the existence of Hohokam-Trincheras contacts between A.D. 900 and somewhat later than A.D. 1100. We tentatively suggest that exchange for marine shell was the basis of the contact and that, from this time onward, the two cultures became more similar. It is unlikely that this single study of rock art will unlock the mystery of this cultural convergence, but we suggest that the convergence may be linked with competition related to marine shell exchange. During the Seden- tary period, as shell ornament production began to shift to large Hohokam villages in the Phoenix Basin and away from villages in the western Pap- agueria, the number of Hohokam who ventured south to obtain unworked shell may have increased. Social organizational changes apparently occurred at the same time as the production shift. An indication of the social change is evidence for residences atop Hohokam platform mounds that could have</page><page sequence="24">342 LINDAUER AND ZASLOW been the abodes of more powerful leaders. The changed leadership position could have been maintained, in part, by control of shell ornament production (McGuire and Howard 1987). The multitude of platform mounds in the Phoenix Basin (41 according to Gregory and Nials 1985) and elsewhere (Wood and McAllister 1980) suggests that many leaders might have needed to establish contacts with the Trincheras to obtain shell. Increased demand for shell products from a number of Hohokam ornament producers probably led to competition among Hohokam groups for alliances with the Trin- cheras. The Trincheras became the shell suppliers by providing unworked shell as a commodity. CONCLUSIONS The presence of complex geometric decorations distinctive of the Hohokam region at a Trincheras site is not an occurrence explainable by chance. We believe that either Hohokam individuals who could reproduce the designs travelled to the Trincheras region, or that the intensity of contact between the two regions increased to a point where designs from imported Hohokam ceramics, textiles, mats, or baskets were copied in rock art. Re- gardless of whether one or both of these explanations accounts for the simi- larities in design, they mark the time period during which the shifts towards closer contacts took place.
