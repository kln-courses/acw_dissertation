Originally prepared as a licentiate dissertation at the Faculty of Theology of the Fu jen Cathoiic Umversity, Nicolas Standaert, S.J., has written a thoughtful and careful pre sentation of a work entitied Ditiankao ("Investigation into the Concepts of Lord and Heaven") by the late 16th - and early 17th - century lay Chinese scholar, Yan Mo. Stan daert demonstrates how this work can shed a unique light on the controversies in China regarding the proper name(s) for God. Yan Mo's careful analysis and presentation can also serve as a model for expanding opportunities for inculturation of faith today. Yan Mo and his family belonged to the lower literati class in Fujian Province. Al though both Yan Mo and his father were disciples of the Jesuit missionaries, they were al so influenced by Dominicans, Franciscans and the Fathers of the Missions Etrangeres de Paris who were also active in their region. The Ditiankao was written primarily in re sponse to the dissention regarding the proper Chinese name(s) for God. In 1693, the Vicar Apostolic of Fujian, Fr. Charles Maigrot, decreed that only the term Tienzhu (Master of Heaveri) was appropriate for use by Chinese Christians. Two other possible terms, Tian (Heaven) and Snangdi (High Lord) were to be avoided completely, because their use would bring with them undesirable connotations. Standaert carefully details all the works attributed to Yan Mo (which date up to the year 1718, when he was in his eighties), giving a brief summary of their subject matter, and noting when differing versions have been preserved and which is the more reliable text for study. Focusing primarily on the Ditiankao, Standaert gives an indication of the difficulties involved in dating the work and gives examples of methods he and others have used, such as trying to identify by name persons mentioned in the work itself. In the end, the evidence suggests to Standaert a date around 1680, a time when non-Jesuit missionar ies were beginning to object to the terms for God which had first been used by the Jesuits, but perhaps before Maigrot's decree itself was issued. Standaert goes on to present Yan Mo's compilation of 65 sayings from several classi cal Chinese wnters which use the terms Tiari and Shangdi. Yan Mo shows that most of these express attributes consistent with Scholastic views of God the Father. For example, number 31: "I, little child, dare not find fault with the command of the High Lord". They include, of course, no knowledge of the other Persons of the Trinity. Instead, for Yan Mo they represent "the prudent ana simple language of the ancient times" (p. 55) before the Christian revelation arrived in his homeland. The Ditiankao is important for Standaert primarily because it was written by a man who deeply believed in both the Confucian tradition and Christianity. Thus it complements Matteo Ricci's earlier writings such as Tianzhu shiyi ("The Solid Meaning of the Lord of Heaven"). Yan Mo is particularly struck by at least one common goal of both Confucianism and Christianity, namely, the making of their followers into saints and sages.</page><page sequence="2">170 GREGORIANUM, VOL. 77 (1996) FASC. I: RECENSIONES Standaert next reviews several of the documents which Yan Mo had quoted to see what they themselves can tell us, specifically about the relationship between God and hu man persons. He also is careful to see whether or not Yan Mo can be accused of quoting these texts selectively. In The Book of Documents, for example, God deals directly only with the king, rewarding good actions and punishing evil. God, primarily referred to as Tian, is due respect and awe. In contrast, The Book of Odes contains several poems in which individual aggrieved persons complain directly to God. The Analects describes Confucius' own special relationship with heaven: he received his virtues from God (pri marily referred to as Tiari) just as a sovereign received his mandate to rule. In a later docu ment, the Mencius, each individual is called upon to incorporate into himself the virtues already found in Heaven (i.e., Tian). Standaert believes that the vision of God seen in The Book of Documents and The Book ofOdes corresponds particularly well with the omnipo tent, anthropomorphic Judeo-Christian God who rewards the good and punishes the evil. After first presenting Yan Mo's work on the Chinese names for God as a literary doc ument in its own context, Standaert concludes by applying several modern theological perspectives to it. For example, he utilizes Rudolf Otto's concepts of mysterium tremen dum and mysterium fascinosum to Yan Mo's work, and sees therein more of the tremen dum involved in the worship of Shangdi and Τιαη, and relatively little of the closeness and active tenderness most clearly manifest in the Incarnation. In conclusion, Standaert sees Yan Mo's book the Ditiankao as a creative dialogue be tween the Chinese classics and Western tradition. His masterful collection of quotes from ciassical Chinese literature showed that the concepts and expectations behind the words Shangdi and Tian did indeed come quite close to many of the concepts and attributes which Scholastic Christianity put fortn as fundamental to the new faith. Standaert makes an excellent case for the Ditiankao's being an example of inculturation at its finest, done by the people of the culture themselves, with the help of those who have brought the new tradition, so that all can be enriched by this exchange.
