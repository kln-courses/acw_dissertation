<plain_text><page sequence="1">Proofs of God's Existence Kelly James Clark / Gordon College George Mavrodes, in his intriguing little book, Belief in God, contends that there is much more to a theistic proof than validity and soundness.' A proof must be valid and sound, but he also adds conditions of cogency and convincingness. An argument is cogent for a person N, Mavrodes says, if and only if (1) it is sound and (2) N knows it to be sound; and an argument is convincing for N if and only if(3) it is cogent for N and (4) N knows that each of its premises is true without having to infer any of them from its conclusion or from any other statements that he knows only by an infer- ence from that conclusion. An argument may be said to constitute a proof if it is valid, sound, cogent, and convincing for N. Because cogency and convincingness are person-relative, Mavrodes is skeptical of the prospects for developing an argument that will prove God's existence to everyone: We are, of course, especially interested in whether there is any argument that will prove God's existence to everyone. Such an argument has apparently not yet been invented. If it is to be invented, there must be some set of propositions that everyone knows and that entail, by logical relations that are also known to every- one, that God exists. The invention of such an argument would, of course, be a wonderful thing, just as would be the development of a drug that would cure all diseases. But there is not much reason to believe that either of these is possible.2 This insightful person-relative notion of proof has not been sufficiently exploited in recent discussions of theistic proofs. The intent of this essay is to illustrate and discuss these Mavrodean intuitions with particular theistic arguments. We will discuss four paradigm examples of theistic arguments: Richard Taylor's cosmological argument, William Paley's argument from design, Alvin Plantinga's ontological argument, and the interesting new probabilistic approach to theistic arguments by the Oxford philosopher, Richard Swinburne. The discussion of each particular argument is not intended to provide novel analytical insights into the structure of the 1 George I.

I will argue that the power of a theistic argument is, in part, a function of what one already believes about God-thereby impugning its success as a proof-but, nonetheless, a theistic argument may provide evidence for one's belief. The belief that God exists shall be construed, as Swinburne states, as the belief that "there exists a person without a body (i.e., a spirit) who is eternal, is perfectly free, omnipotent, omniscient, perfectly good, and the creator of all things."3 A notorious defect plaguing most theistic proofs is that they are deficient in proving the existence of God thus defined. Taylor's version of the cosmological argument attempts to prove a posteriori, from, primarily, modal considerations, only that some necessary being exists upon which the world depends for its exis- tence but whose existence is dependent upon no other; this dependence is what Taylor means by creation. Classical Aristotelian cosmological arguments (such as Aquinas's First and Second Ways) are more strictly factual and attempt to prove, a posteriori, from premises such as "some things are in motion," a conclusion such as "some being exists which is the first and unmoved mover." Aquinas's Third Way, the argument from possibility and necessity, is a distinctly modal version of the cosmo- logical argument and, like Taylor, attempts to prove the necessary exis- tence of some being; Taylor contends that this project is of merely speculative and metaphysical significance because these arguments imply nothing about the aforementioned divine attributes. The genius of the ontological argument, on the other hand, is that, if successful, it proves a priori the necessary existence of a being that has every perfection: in Plantinga's terminology, a maximally excellent being. This purely modal argument would prove not only God's necessary exis- tence but also the richness of his character; Anselmian perfect being theol- ogy takes a major natural theological step toward orthodoxy over the Thomistic proofs. Swinburne, denying the validity of the a priori proofs of God's existence, denies God's logically necessary existence and attempts to argue, from primarily factual premises, for the existence of a logically contingent divine being-although this being possesses his attri- butes necessarily and his existence is factually necessary, that is, he is not dependent upon any other being for his existence.4 3 Richard Swinburne, The Existence of God (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1979), p. 8.

One could select for this discussion versions that are more strictly factual and a posteriori,5 strictly logical and a priori, and modal or factual or an admix- ture of the modal and the factual; furthermore, one could select argu- ments from eras past as well as contemporary versions. Although this article is necessarily selective, it is intended to be representative. An attempt has been made to include modal (Plantinga's), factual (Paley's and Swinburne's), and mixed (Taylor's) arguments; a priori (Plantinga's), and a posteriori (Taylor's, Paley's, and Swinburne's) arguments; classical (Paley's) and contemporary (Taylor's, Plantinga's, and Swinburne's) ver- sions; as well as arguments that argue for differing conclusions-although each arguer, Taylor excluded, intends to prove the contingent or neces- sary existence of some divine being that is distinct from the world and upon which the world depends for its existence. I. THE COSMOLOGICAL ARGUMENT Modal cosmological arguments are typically motivated by the riddle of existence. The perennial question, Why is there something rather than nothing? stands behind these arguments. And it is indeed puzzling that there be anything at all (it would not be nearly so puzzling to ask, if noth- ing had existed, Why is there nothing rather than something? Of course if this had been the case, there also wouldn't be anyone around to ask this odd question).6 What cosmological arguments assume is that this question is meaningful and that there is a good answer to the question. That is, the- istic proofs typically presuppose a "principle of sufficient reason" which states that for every positive fact or truth there is a sufficient cause or rea- son for why that fact obtains or why that statement is true. Richard Taylor motivates this principle in his version of the cosmological argument.7 He says that if one is walking through a forest and finds a large, translucent ball then one believes that it got there somehow or other, pre- sumably, by some human means. Reason compels one to believe that there is some sufficient reason which explains how the ball came to be. There are at least two answers which the principle of sufficient reason will not allow one to accept. First, one cannot accept that it came to be without any reason or cause; one cannot believe that it simply popped into existence. Further, rea- 14, and Swinburne, The Existence of God, pp. 92-93. If God's existence is logically necessary, then a probabilistic argument from factual premises is unnecessary; see n. 46 below. 5 Although it must be recognized that most a posteriori arguments for the existence of God employ some a priori judgments. 6 This is not so puzzling for Richard Nozick; see his Philosophical Explanations (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1981), pp. 115-28. 7 Richard Taylor, Metaphysics (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1984), pp. 103-4. 61</page><page sequence="4">The Journal of Religion son will not accept an explanation which simply states that the ball has always been there. Its being there a long time (or for all time) is not a sufficient rea- son for the ball's existence. If it had been there for all time then one would reasonably ask for the sufficient reason for this translucent ball's always exist- ing. Reason compels one to believe, Taylor contends, that the existence of the ball can only be explained by appeal to another being. The principle of sufficient reason, as Taylor defines it, states that for every "positive truth there is some sufficient reason for it, something which, in this sense, makes it true-in short that there is some sort of explanation, known or unknown, for everything."8 There are two ways that statements can be true: statements may be contingently true, which means that their being true depends on something else; and statements may be necessarily true, which means that their truth is not dependent on the truth of any other statements, but they are true by their own nature. Hence, for contin- gent truths, the principle of sufficient reason entails that there is something which makes them true or some explanation for them; there are no brute or unexplained contingent truths (given the truth of the principle of suffi- cient reason). Taylor motivates the application of the principle of sufficient reason to the world as follows: Consider again the strange ball that we imagine has been found in the forest. Now we can hardly doubt that there must be an explanation for the existence of such a thing, though we may have no notion what that explanation is. It is not, moreover, the fact of its having been found in the forest rather than elsewhere that renders an explanation necessary. It matters not in the least where it hap- pens to be, for our question is not how it happens to be there but how it happens to exist at all. If we in our imagination annihilate the forest, leaving only this ball in an open field, our conviction that it is a contingent thing and owes its existence to something other than itself is not reduced in the least. If we now imagine the field to be annihilated and in fact everything else as well to banish into nothing- ness, leaving only this ball to constitute the entire physical universe, then we can- not for a moment suppose that its existence has thereby been explained, or the need of any explanation eliminated, or that its existence is suddenly rendered self explanatory. If we now carry this thought one step further and suppose that no other reality ever has existed or ever will exist, that this ball forever consti- tutes the entire physical universe, then we must still insist on there being some reason independent of itself why it should exist rather than not. ... And again, it matters not at all what the thing in question is, whether it be large and complex, such as the world we actually find ourselves in, or whether it be something small, simple and insignificant, such as a ball, a bacterium, or the merest grain of sand.9 8 Ibid., p. 104. 9 Ibid., pp. 105-6. 62</page><page sequence="5">Proofs of God's Existence Thus, Taylor argues, the questions, Why is there something rather than nothing? or What is the sufficient reason for the existence of the universe? are perfectly legitimate and they have perfectly reasonable answers. As Taylor says, "From the principle of sufficient reason it follows, of course, that there must be a reason, not only for the existence of everything in the world but for the world itself."'0 The existence of the universe must be explained analogously to the ball explanation. Since the universe is a con- tingent existent, it must have an explanation outside of itself; its existence is dependent upon something else. The universe will not be explained sim- ply by saying that it popped into existence uncaused or by saying that it has existed forever. Even if it has existed forever, by the principle of suffi- cient reason there still must be a sufficient reason for its existing forever. Since everything in the world is such that it could pass away, Taylor contends that there is no reason to doubt that the world as a whole is con- tingent. Hence, by the principle of sufficient reason, it follows that the world depends upon something else for its existence. Now there are only two options for the explanation of the world: either (1) the world depends for its existence upon something else, which in turn depends on still another thing, this depending upon still another, ad infinitum; or (2) the world derives its existence from something that exists by its own nature and that is accordingly eternal and imperishable, and is the cre- ator of heaven and earth." Taylor rejects the first option as impossible because it does not give a sufficient reason why the world exists. It repeatedly avoids giving a sufficient reason. Hence, the principle of suffi- cient reason leads us to embrace the second alternative: the world depends for its existence upon an eternal and imperishable creator of the world, one whose existence does not depend upon something else, that is, whose existence is necessary. The most fundamental problem which vexes modal cosmological argu- ments is the application of the principle of sufficient reason. While it is rational to believe that Taylor's strange ball had some reason for its exis- tence, it is not clear that the universe as a whole must have a reason for its existence. Presumably the nontheist will believe that the world is eternal. Hence, one option which avoids the theistic conclusion is to believe that there is a contingent explanation (or finite cause) for every event, although there is no ultimate, necessary explanation for everything. Thus, the existence of a contingent existent, A, may be explained by the existence of another contingent existent, B, ad infinitum. Of course this option depends on the cogency of an infinite-and, probably, temporal- 10 Ibid., p. 105. 11 Ibid., p. 110. 63</page><page sequence="6">The Journal of Religion regress of explanations, but that possibility has not been disproven." On this analysis, there is an explanation for every particular contingent event or existent, but it is considered perverse to ask for the sufficient reason of the complete set of particular events or existents (i.e., the world). The question, What is the reason for the world? is considered a nonstarter by the nontheist. Bertrand Russell, one of the great critics of religious belief in our cen- tury, believed that the question of the existence of the universe was meaningless and was quite content believing in the universe's brute and unexplained existence. Why does the universe exist? Russell believed that it just does. Period. And that is the end of the reasoning process. As Russell says: "I should believe that it [the universe] is just there, and that's all."'" Russell chose at a certain point to give up the strong princi- ple of sufficient reason which is necessary for a cosmological proof of God's existence; notice, though, that the theist also gives up the principle of sufficient reason when it suits him-when it no longer seems suitable to ask the question. The theist will answer the question, Why does God exist? in a similar fashion: "Hejust does."'4 The application of the princi- ple of sufficient reason must stop somewhere, but it is not clear, indepen- dent of one's beliefs, where one is rationally compelled to stop applying the principle of sufficient reason. It is difficult to defend one's stopping point without appealing to one's belief or nonbelief in God. Surely the theist will think it appropriate to stop only with God, yet the nontheist will stop at the universe. In his famous debate with Russell, Father Copleston states the problem: "If one does not wish to embark on the path which leads to the affirmation of a transcendent being, however the latter may be described (if described at all) one has to deny the reality of the problem, assert that things 'just are' and that the existential question is a pseudoquestion. And if one refuses to sit down at the chess board and 12 William Lane Craig in his The Kalaam Cosmological Argument (New York: Barnes &amp; Noble, 1979) has, however, argued that an eternal world is indeed impossible because it would be impossible to get to the present by traversing an infinite amount of time. His contention may, in fact, be true (contingently), but it is not clear that an infinite series arriving at the present is impossible. One can construct a model in arithmetic that demonstrates its possibility: using the negative numbers, assign 0 to the present moment, and -1 to the preceding moment, and -2 to the preceding moment, and so forth. This consistent set demonstrates at least the conceptual possibility of an infinite temporal series that terminates at the present moment. The alleged impossibility of traversing an infinite amount of time is what generates Zenoish paradoxes, which paradoxes may be raised for any traversing of time. Presumably, there are an infinite number of moments between any two distinct times; hence, any traversing of time logically requires traversing an infinite series. 13 Quoted in John Hick, The Existence of God (New York: Macmillan, 1964), p. 175. 14 This is an exaggeration; the theist, of course, believes that God cannot fail to exist and, hence, his existence does not require explanation. It is at this point that, as Kant recognized, the cosmological argument becomes an overt ontological argument. 64</page><page sequence="7">Proofs of God's Existence make a move, one cannot, of course, be checkmated."'5 And there seem to be no premises that both parties accept by which this disagreement may be adjudicated. The theist may attempt to resolve the debate in favor of his conclusion by contending that the strong principle of sufficient reason (needed for a cosmological argument), let us call it SPSR, is either self-evident or neces- sarily true.'6 However, the first option is surely false and the second may be true, but nonetheless of little value. First, the theist may believe that SPSR is self-evident, that it is a constitutive principle of metaphysics. But what is a self-evident truth? A proposition is self-evident if and only if upon understanding it one sees it to be true. Alvin Plantinga distinguishes two features of a self-evident truth.17 First, a self-evident proposition has an epistemic component: a proposition is self-evident if one knows it immediately, that is, noninferentially. Second, a self-evident proposition has a phenomenological component: it has "about it a kind of luminous aura or glow when you bring it to mind or consider it."'18 He elucidates this further: with a self-evident proposition one feels a strong inclination to accept it, there is a luminous obviousness which compels assent, and so forth. With respect to SPSR, Russell rejects it and settles for an infinite series of contingent explanations.19 Now Russell (when he is not in the log- ical positivist mode) surely understands what he is rejecting; he surely understands what it would mean for SPSR to be true and for the universe to have its existence depend upon God or for everything, including the universe as a whole, to have a sufficient explanation. But he simply believes that SPSR is false. Hence, given that he understands SPSR and that he judges it to be false (he has not been moved by its phenomenological luster), it cannot be a self-evident proposition.20 Can the theist generate rational incumbency and, hence, a proof by claiming that SPSR is necessarily true? I think not. Presumably, SPSR if 15 Hick, p. 93. 16 For an excellent discussion of the controversy surrounding various versions of the principle of sufficient reason, see William Rowe, The Cosmological Argument (Princeton, NJ.: Princeton tU ni- versity Press, 1975), pp. 60-114. 17 Alvin Plantinga, "Reason and Belief in God," in Faith and Rationality, ed. Alvin Plantinga and Nicholas Wolterstorff (Notre Dame, Ind.: University of Notre Dame Press, 1983), pp. 55-59. 18 Ibid., p. 57. 19 Russell would not reject a weaker version of the principle of sufficient reason; presumably he believes that things do not just pop into existence for no reason. Furthermore, he will surely believe that everything has at least a contingent explanation, although he will reject the idea that the universe is a thing; each part of the universe will have an explanation, but the universe as a whole will not require an explanation. What he rejects is a principle of sufficient reason which is strong enough to require an explanation for the existence of the universe as a whole, which is necessary for the construction of a cosmological proof of the existence of God. 20 The theist can at this point make the implausible claim that Bertrand Russell is a dolt and simply does not understand SPSR, hence preserving his belief in SPSR's status as self-evident. 65</page><page sequence="8">The Journal of Religion true is necessarily true. However, its being necessarily true does not entail that it is rationally incumbent on the nontheist to accept it. Surely rational creatures are not obliged to agree on all necessary truths. There are, for example, necessary truths in mathematics that all rational creatures are not obliged to accept, such as Goldbach's conjecture or its denial (every even number is the sum of two primes), since neither Goldbach's conjec- ture nor its denial have been proved.21 Furthermore, most significant philosophical truths-such as compatibilism or contra-causal libertarian- ism, the justified true belief analysis of knowledge, the claim that every- thing there is exists-are if true necessarily true; and surely rationality does not impel agreement about these matters. Hence, it is not sufficient that SPSR be necessarily true to demonstrate its incumbency on all rational creatures. If the theist could generate an argument from prem- ises which the nontheist accepts to SPSR as a conclusion, then these would constitute prima facie grounds for demonstrating rational incumbency, but the prospects for this are not optimal. The nontheist, of course, must live with the untoward consequences of rejecting a sufficient reason, cause, or purpose for the existence of the uni- verse. The nontheist must contend with the fact that the world is at best inexplicable and that man's place in the universe is equally so. Russell, in one of his more candid moments, recognizes man's plight in his purpose- less cosmos: Such, in outline, but even more purposeless, more void of meaning, is the world which science presents for our belief. Amid such a world, our ideals hencefor- ward must find a home. That man is the product of causes which had no prevision of the end they were achieving; that his origin, growth, his hopes and fears, his loves and his beliefs, are but the outcome of accidental collocations of atoms; that no fire, no heroism, no intensity of thought and feeling, can preserve an individual life beyond the grave; that all the labors of the ages, all the devo- tion, all the inspiration, all the noonday brightness of human genius, are destined to extinction in the vast death of the solar system, and that the whole temple of man's achievement must inevitably be buried beneath the debris of a universe in ruins-all these things, if not quite beyond dispute, are yet so nearly certain that no philosophy which rejects them can hope to stand. Only within the scaffolding 21 Even if a necessary truth has been proved it does not follow that all rational creatures are obliged to accept it. For example, my mother (a decent example of a rational creature) is under no rational obligation to affirm a sufficiently high level necessary truth, say, the incompleteness of arithmetic. She lacks understanding, but not rationality. In order to prove her irrational, it seems to me, one would have to explain the meaning of the relevant propositions and the relevant argu- ments in terms that she can understand. Since this is unlikely, it is difficult to see how her rejec- tion or affirmation of this necessary truth reflects poorly on her rationality. The SPSR seems to fall more properly into the category of Goldbach's conjecture, however, since it, heretofore, lacks proof. 66</page><page sequence="9">Proofs of God's Existence of these truths, only on the firm foundation of unyielding despair, can the soul's habitation henceforth be safely built.22 Recognizing meaninglessness is, clearly, not a reason for believing that the cosmological argument is valid and sound. The nontheist is not illogi- cal for accepting these consequences. He might find himself faced with a psychological hurdle of the first order, but he can hardly be accused of irrationality in embracing the absurdity of it all.23 But to return to our previous discussion, this illustrates that one's ver- dict on the cogency of a theistic argument depends, in part, upon what one already believes. This can be made more understandable if one recog- nizes that our beliefs are logically interrelated and that our deepest com- mitments about the nature of reality affect many of our believings. If one is deeply committed to belief in God, then a cosmological proof will be so obvious as to be redundant. One may already believe in God's necessary existence, that is, that God's nonexistence is impossible. God will be clearly seen as the ultimate explainer of everything that is. If one does not have that commitment, then one might rest content with believing that the universe is, at its most fundamental level, inexplicable and refuse to press the question-the questioning process must stop somewhere, one contends, so why not here? The influence of one's deepest commitments on the rest of one's believings can be seen in an analogous dispute in the political sphere. A debate between a Marxist and a capitalist about the one true economic theory would quickly reach a standoff. The most fundamental commit- ments of the respective arguers would entail different ways of seeing the economic world. Different facts would have different weightings within the different systems, some apparently significant facts would be dis- counted by the competing theory, and different reasoning principles would be thought applicable-they disagree about the nature of man, the nature of the historical process, man's natural rights to property, and so forth. These considerations militate against any sort of proof or inelucta- ble argument for either of these positions and support the notion that proof is person-relative, since one, presumably, is attempting to prove something to someone, a successful proof will depend upon what that per- son already believes. Notice that one of the positions, either Marxism or capitalism, may be true and at least one is false, and the arguments gar- nered for the true position may be sound. Nonetheless in order for the 22 Bertrand Russell, "A Free Man's Worship," in Why IAm Not a Christian (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1957), pp. 106-7. 23 This can be turned into another sort of grounds (although not a proof) for belief in God. See e.g., C. Stephen Evans, Subjectivity and Religious Belief(Washington, D.C.: Christian Univer- sity Press, 1978), pp. 178-214. 67</page><page sequence="10">The Journal of Religion argument to be successful it must be convincing; it must have the power to move the unbeliever to accept the conclusion. In a successful proof the premises not only must be true but the unbeliever must understand and accept the premises as well; and acceptance of a premise is often already a function of what one believes about Marxism or capitalism.24 It is obvious from the Marxist/capitalist discussion that it is typically most difficult to persuade the opposing party that all of one's premises and principles are true. And, as I have been arguing, this is exceedingly diffi- cult to do because one's deepest and most fundamental commitments influence the rest of one's believings. The difficulties in persuasion and proof are evident not only in the sphere of political theory but in any area where fundamental commitments are involved: ethical disputes, scientific disputes about the indeterminacy of quantum phenonema or the nature of physical space and time, disputes about freedom and responsibility, dis- agreements concerning the nature and extent of human knowing, and so on. If these disputes cannot be settled by appeal to theory-free evidence or propositions, then one must surely be cautious in one's claims about the prospects of a universally persuasive theistic argument. It is not irrational to use one's deepest commitments against a particular argument that allegedly refutes one's beliefs. Suppose, for example, that an atheist believed that the cosmological argument was unsound because he was quite certain that God did not exist. Given his commitments he would reject a crucial premise like SPSR. His reasoning process would be an instance of the logical inference from modus tollens, which is symbo- lized as follows: if A then B; B is false; therefore A is false. This is a per- fectly rational process-that is, it is strictly logical. An instance of this is the atheist's initial refusal to accept the cosmologi- cal argument: if the cosmological argument is sound, then God exists: God does not exist; therefore, the cosmological argument is unsound- and then he would reject one of the premises, say SPSR, in the argument. If the argument is sound, however, then the atheist has, intriguingly, fol- lowed a perfectly rational process that has reduced him from knowledge to ignorance. The theist also legitimately uses this way of arguing: if the deductive argument from evil is sound, then God does not exist; God does exist; therefore, the deductive argument from evil is not sound. Even if the theist cannot figure out where the argument from evil fails, his com- mitment to belief in God may rationally hold sway. If the theist allows this sort of reasoning with the problem of evil, then it cannot be denied the atheist with the cosmological argument. This legitimate mode of reason- 24 Simply because a proof is person-relative and not ineluctable does not entail that dialogue between a Marxist and a capitalist is impossible or destined for failure. As I will agree, failing as proof is not sufficient for undermining one's confidence in the evidence. 68</page><page sequence="11">Proofs of God's Existence ing illustrates that rationality is not merely a matter of valid and sound proofs and that the cosmological argument is not successful as a proof because it lacks convincingness. Why believe that the cosmological argument fails to constitute a proof because it depends upon one's belief in God? For one to understand SPSR, the major premise in the cosmological argument, one must under- stands that it applies not only to tables and chairs, but also to the universe as a whole; additionally, one must have sufficient understanding of its logi- cal relation to theism in order to comprehend that God provides his own sufficient reason for existence and that all contingent existents ultimately depend upon him for their existence. Thus, a sufficient understanding of SPSR will involve comprehending the close conceptual connection between SPSR and the existence of God. Upon understanding this inti- mate conceptual link, a convinced atheist will reject SPSR, while a theist will, typically, be led to embrace it. Hence, one's understanding of SPSR entails understanding its implicit commitment to a necessary being; one's acceptance or rejection of SPSR is typically, in part, a function of what one already believes about the existence of God. Because of the connection between the crucial premise and the conclu- sion of the cosmological argument, it fails as a proof of the existence of God. The fourth condition of a Mavrodean proof for a person N is that N knows that each of the argument's premises is true without having to infer any of them from its conclusion or from any other statements that he knows only by an inference from that conclusion. If my analysis is correct, one does not know that SPSR is true, or one is not inclined to accept SPSR as true, without some prior initial commitment to the existence of God. Thus, the fourth condition fails. Hence, the cosmological argument fails as a proof, even if the theist knows that all of the premises are true, although it may constitute a good person-relative argument. II. THE ARGUMENT FROM DESIGN The argument from design proceeds from some rather specific observa- tions about the nature of the world. Aquinas's Fifth Way is an argument from design ("things which lack knowledge act for ends" is the first prem- ise), and the most famous design argument was offered by William Paley (1743-1805) in his Natural Theology, or Evidences of the Existence and Attri- butes of the Deity Collected from the Appearances of Nature. The intuition behind the argument from design is quite simple and has a great deal of initial appeal: the world shows design; design implies a designer; hence, the world requires a designer. Paley's initial statement of the argument is in the form of an analogy wherein he compares the world to a watch. Both, he believes, have a high 69</page><page sequence="12">The Journal of Religion degree of design which can only be explained by appeal to a designer. The watch, of course, can be explained by appeal to a merely human agent, but the specific instances of design in the world require belief in the existence of a cosmic watchmaker on the scale of the divine. Let us consider his argument: In crossing a heath, suppose I pitch my foot against a stone, and were asked how the stone came to be there, I might possibly answer, that, for anything I knew to be the contrary, it had lain there for ever; nor would it, perhaps, be very easy to show the absurdity of this answer. But suppose I found a watch upon the ground, and it should be inquired how the watch happened to be in that place, I should hardly think of the answer which I had before given that, for anything I knew, the watch might always have been there. Yet why should not this answer serve for the watch as well as for the stone? why is it not as admissible in the second case as in the first? For this reason, and for no other, viz., that, when we come to inspect the watch, we perceive (what we could not discover in the stone) that its several parts are framed and put together for a purpose, e.g. that they are so formed and adjusted as to produce motion, and that motion so regulated as to point out the hour of the day; that, if the different parts had been differently shaped from what they are, if a different size from what they are, or placed after any other manner, or in any other order than that in which they are placed, either no motion at all would have been carried on in the machine, or none which would have answered the use that is now served by it.... The mechanism being observed, (it requires indeed an examination of the instrument, and per- haps some previous knowledge of the subject, to perceive and understand it; but being once, as we have said, observed and understood,) the inference, we think, is inevitable, that the watch must have had a maker; that there must have existed, at some time, and at some place or other, an artificer or artificers who formed it for the purpose which we find it actually to answer; who comprehended its con- struction, and designed its use.25 Paley completes the analogy by considering the more wonderful, subtle, and complex manifestations of specific design in the world. These instances of design in the universe, as with the watch, compel us rationally to assent to an artificer or grand designer of the universe. As with the cosmological argument, the argument from design cannot be discussed simply in terms of validity and soundness. Since it is an argu- ment from analogy the argument must be discussed in terms of the appro- priateness of the analogy. With analogical arguments one is concerned with the strength or weakness of the analogy. Hume recognizes that the argument is based on the principle that like effects prove like causes. Hence, the greater the similarity between the effects which are seen, the stronger the argument to the causes that cannot be seen. As Hume states: 25 As quoted in Hick (n. 13 above), pp. 99-100. 70</page><page sequence="13">Proofs of God's Existence But to show you still more inconveniences ... in your anthropomorphism, please to take a new survey of your principles. Like effects prove like causes. This is the experimental argument; and this, you say too, is the sole theological argument. Now it is certain that the liker the effects which are seen and the liker the causes which are inferred, the stronger is the argument. Every departure on either side diminishes the probability and renders the experiment less conclusive. You can- not doubt of this principle; neither ought you reject its consequences.26 The problem with the argument from design is that the universe is unique, and of its mode of origin we have no experience. Hence, any inferences about it must be based on educated guesses, presumably by analogy. Hume alerts the reader to the problem of the analogy in the pre- vious quotation: there are not only similarities between machines and the universe, there are also dissimilarities. The similarities will count in favor of a humanlike artificer, and the dissimilarities will count against. Hume presses the analogy in his well-known criticisms, which will only briefly be recounted. If the cause is proportioned to the effect then, since the universe is finite, there is no reason to believe that its cause is not like- wise finite-and contingent, as well. Because of the many and manifest defects in nature (evil), there is no reason to believe that the designer is perfect. The argument does not prove that there is a single designer; nei- ther does it rule out complete anthropomorphism, affirming that the designer has a body as well as hands, ears, and eyes. Hume, himself, believed that any universe would have the appearance of being designed (imagine what one would be like which did not seem at least partly ordered). He accounts for the design of the universe along nat- uralistic lines. Given an infinite amount of time and finite set of possibili- ties, a universe like this one will exist. If matter is active and can acquire motion without the action of a first mover, then there are many possibili- ties for configuration. One possibility is that this active matter will settle down to some uniformity like the universe is now. Thus, Hume can account for the "design" of the universe without appealing to anything external to the universe itself. Paley himself unwittingly alerts us to the problems with an argument from design. We know that a watch demands the postulation of a watch- maker because we have all had plenty of experience with watches. Some- one with no watch experiences, say a primitive with above-average intelligence, presumably would not be led by reason to postulate a watch- maker. Such a person would simply not know what the watch was and would not be irrational in not assenting to a watchmaker. Paley notes, "It requires indeed an examination of the instrument, and perhaps some pre- 26 David Hume, Dialogues concerning Natural Religion (Indianapolis: Hackett, 1980), p. 34. 71</page><page sequence="14">The Journal of Religion vious knowledge of the subject, to perceive and understand it." This prob- lem may be raised in a more pressing manner for universes. Surely few of us have had experiences of other universes (universes not being as plenti- ful as watches), and, hence, this initially counts against the watch analogy. Given the evidence, the design of the universe, and proceeding by anal- ogy, there are a whole range of competing hypotheses that are equi- compatible: the God of Abraham, Isaac, andJacob, a finite and contingent designer, an imperfect designer, a committee of finite beings, an embod- ied being, and so on. Which hypothesis one finds most rationally accepta- ble cannot be determined simply by examining the data themselves. Given these hypotheses which are perfectly consistent with the data, there is no evidence that demands that one rationally prefer one theory over the other. As Hume says, "By what phenomena in nature can we pretend to decide the controversy?"27 The answer, it seems, is none. So Hume con- cludes, "In a word ... a man who follows your hypothesis is able, perhaps, to assert or conjecture that the universe sometimes arose from something like design; but beyond that position he cannot ascertain one single cir- cumstance, and is left afterwards to fix every point of his theology by the utmost license of fancy and hypothesis."28 Most are likely to reject the embodied being or committee hypotheses, not because they have been logically excluded by the data, but because they do not seem very likely or plausible. Initial plausibility commitments are regularly and legitimately employed in the rejection of scientific hypotheses and are not necessarily "the utmost license of fancy and hypothesis."29 One's judgments of the convincingness of the argument from design is, in part, a function of one's commitments to the plausibility or implausibility of the competing hypotheses. Assuming design, which hypothesis one accepts to explain design is a function already of one's beliefs about God. A further defect of the argument from design is the outright rejection of its crucial factual and first premise: the universe is designed. Paley seeks to establish this by the analogy of finding a watch and seeking, by the prin- ciple of sufficient reason, the sufficient reason for the watch. However, as Paley recognizes, had he stumbled upon a stone, such an explanatory quest would never have gotten started. A stone, quite simply, does not bear marks of design, and one is not thereby obliged to seek its designer. How does one determine, apart from one's beliefs about the designer, if the universe is like a watch (i.e., designed) and not like a stone (i.e., undesigned)? More specifically, how does one determine, apart from one's 27 Ibid., p. 37. 28 Ibid. 29 See Secs. IV and V below. 72</page><page sequence="15">Proofs of God's Existence beliefs about God as creator, whether or not particular instances in the world are designed or not? Paley's artifacts include the humps of camels, the suitability of bird wings for flight, the pouches of oppossums, and the intricate organization of the human body, especially the human eye.30 If one is a theist, then one will surely believe that these are, indeed, designed (although possibly through evolutionary processes) and, hence, more like the watch. If one is not a theist, then one will think these instances more relevantly resemble, with respect to design, a stone than a watch and will not assent to the first premise of a design argument. It is not clear how the theist could persuade the nontheist, and vice versa, that his initial judg- ments are true-since the initial judgment involves a commitment already to the designer for the theist. Hence, one's beliefs about God will, in part, affect one's acceptance or rejection of the crucial first premise of a design argument. The connection between the first premise, that the world is designed, and belief in God is so tight that some contend that the argument from design begs the question: to countenance cosmic design is already to be committed to a designer. Either one accepts the first premise and then one's beliefs about God will, in part, determine which of the competing hypotheses are eliminated; or one's beliefs about God are intricately involved already in the acceptance or rejection of the first premise. In either case, one's acceptance of a crucial premise is in part a function of one's commitment to the conclusion and, hence, fails the convincingness criterion of a Mavrodean proof. The argument from design does not con- stitute a successful theistic proof. III. THE ONTOLOGICAL ARGUMENT Alvin Plantinga has offered the most trenchant recent criticisms of the Anselmian and Cartesian ontological arguments. From the ashes of these flawed arguments, Plantinga has raised up his own modal version of the ontological argument. His version neither begs the question nor does it violate our metaphysical intuitions by ascribing properties to possible but nonactual objects-which Anselm violates when he assumes for a reductio argument that that being than which none greater can be conceived exists in the mind and not in reality and then proceeds to ascribe properties to this merely possible, nonexistent being.3' Plantinga's version of the onto- 30 Darwin, a great critic of Paley's argument from design, clearly rejects these as designed. This rejection is surely, in part, a function of his commitment to naturalism. 31 For his criticisms of the classical versions, see Alvin Plantinga, God, Freedom and Evil (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans, 1977), pp. 85-108; see also his "Aquinas on Anselm," in God and the Good, ed. Clifton Orlebeke and Lewis Smedes (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans, 1975), pp. 122-39. 73</page><page sequence="16">The Journal of Religion logical argument does not assume that there are nonexistent beings; rather, it assumes only that there are properties (the stuff of possible worlds).32 Hence, Plantinga's modal version operates with properties and their instances or exemplifications in possible worlds, not with nonexist- ent objects.33 Let me briefly outline Plantinga's argument (because of lack of space the presentation is understandably spare): 1. There is a world, W, in which maximal greatness is instantiated. 2. Necessarily, a being is maximally great only if it has maximal excellence in every world. 3. Necessarily, a being has maximal excellence in every world only if it has onmiscience, omnipotence, and moral perfection in every world. If W had been actual 4. There is no omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect being would have been an impossible proposition. 5. What is impossible does not vary from world to world. 6. Hence, 4 is impossible in the actual world. 7. Hence, there exists in the actual world a being that is essentially omnis- cient, omnipotent, and morally good.34 There have been a number of criticisms of this argument: J. L. Mackie contends that it assumes an illegitimate axiom system for modal logic;35 Peter van Inwagen and James Tomberlin argue that Plantinga is incorrect in his view that one is rational or reasonable in accepting the first premise;36 or it might be argued that the argument is circular or begs the question." For our purposes, I will focus on the criticism that alleges that this argument can also be used to prove the necessary nonexistence of 32 This assumption is not as extravagant as it may seem. Possible worlds are just maximal states of affairs that can be construed out of one's reflective ontology: from propositions, proper- ties, and states of affairs; see Alvin Plantinga, The Nature of Necessity (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1974), pp. 44-51, 123-63. Not all versions of possible worlds semantics are equally parsimoni- ous; see David Lewis, The Plurality of Worlds (New York: Blackwell, 1986), pp. 1-96. 33 See Plantinga, God, Freedom and Evil, pp. 101-4. 34 Ibid., pp. 111-12. 35 Plantinga accepts the axiom system S5 in which possibilities and impossibilities do not vary from world to world. This, of course, is essential for his argument: he must logically be able to move from the impossibility of 4 in any arbitrarily chosen possible world to the impossibility of 4 in the actual world. Such a move is precluded in other modal systems. J. L. Mackie contends that Plantinga has accepted a "rather arbitrary modal system which makes it valid" in his The Miracle of Theism (n. 3 above), pp. 55-63. In Plantinga's defense, the S5 modal system does not seem arbi- trary; rather, our modal intuitions seem to support S5-independently of one's commitment to the ontological argument. 36 Peter van Inwagen, "Ontological Arguments," Nous 11 (1977): 375-95; and James Tom- berlin, "Plantinga and the Ontological Argument," in Alvin Plantinga, ed. James E. Tomberlin and Peter van Inwagen (Dordrecht: D. Reidel, 1985), pp. 257-70. 37 Plantinga rightly rejects these claims in The Nature of Necessity, pp. 217-18. 74</page><page sequence="17">Proofs of God's Existence God.38 Plantinga himself notes that not every sane and rational person who reflects on the first premise will feel obliged to accept it. In fact, when one sees the intimate conceptual connection between the first premise and the conclusion, if one is inclined to disbelieve the conclusion then one will also be inclined to believe that the first premise is false. If one believes that the first premise is false, then one cannot believe that the argument is sound. Plantinga further notes that one can construct an equally valid argu- ment to the necessary nonexistence of God. He considers another prop- erty which he calls "no-maximality" that, if exemplified, entails that maximal greatness is impossible. From this it follows, given that what is impossible does not vary from world to world, that maximal greatness is impossible in the actual world; hence, a maximally great being does not exist in the actual world. One insight that clearly follows from this discus- sion is that God's existence or nonexistence is necessary. But more to our point: is one rationally obliged to accept that maximal greatness is possibly instantiated or that no-maximality is possibly instantiated? If one is a the- ist, then one will surely opt for the former; if one is a nontheist, who understands the close conceptual connection between 1 and 7, then one will surely accept the latter. That is, if one is a nontheist and understands that acceding to God's mere possibility entails God's necessary existence, then one will believe that God's existence is not even possible. Now surely either 1 or "No-maximality is possibly exemplified" is true-in fact, necessarily true. However, it is difficult to see how one could establish which is true, independently of one's belief in God. The crucial point for our discussion is that Plantinga's ontological argument provides another illustration for the thesis that the convincingness of a theistic proof depends, in part, upon what one already believes about God. In Plantinga's modal version of the ontological argument it is a func- tion of whether or not one believes that God's existence is possible. There is no belief-independent means for settling whether the first premise or its denial is true and, hence, no belief-independent means for determining the argument's soundness. Upon discerning the close conceptual connec- tion between the first premise and the conclusion, one is typically likely to accept the premise (and, hence, judge the argument sound) only if one is already antecedently disposed toward belief in God; one is likely to reject the premise if one is indisposed toward belief in God. Either premise 1 or its denial is true, but that is of little interest for the task of constructing a proof as I have construed it. In order to constitute a proof one must know the truth of the first premise without having to infer it from the conclu- sion. If one is not already predisposed toward the conclusion, then one 38 See ibid., pp. 219-21; Tomberlin, pp. 263-68. 75</page><page sequence="18">The Journal of Religion will not typically accept the major premise, thereby precluding the success of an ontological argument qua proof. IV. GOD AND PROBABILITY A remarkable new way of arguing for the existence of God has been recently developed. The major proponent of this form of argument is Richard Swinburne.39 This form of argument departs from traditional theistic proofs in at least two ways. (1) The arguments are probabilistic, not deductive.40 They purport to demonstrate that, on the evidence adduced, it is over all probable that God exists (although it is not necessary that he exists given that evidence). (2) The arguments are an instance of "inference to best explanation" arguments. The arguments construe the- ism as a hypothesis along the lines of a scientific hypothesis and seek tojus- tify it accordingly as the best of competing explanations of the evidence. The hypothesis that emerges the probabilistic victor on the basis of the evidence is said to be "confirmed" by the evidence. Swinburne contends that the universe requires an explanation and that the existence of the uni- verse is best explained by the hypothesis of theism and, hence, the exis- tence of the world is evidence that confirms the hypothesis of theism. In order to determine the structure of this sort of argument I will proceed by way of example with a confirmed scientific theory. In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, physicists were puzzled by certain phenomena: the laws of combining proportions for chemicals, the behavior of gases when heated and cooled, the black body phenom- ena, Milliken's oil drop experiments, marks on cloud chambers, and so forth. There was nothing in the accepted scientific theories that would either lead one to expect or to explain these intriguing phenomena. Hence, given the current state of knowledge, or on their background beliefs, the phenomena in question are extremely unlikely-that is, not to be expected. While many competing hypotheses like phlogiston and caloric theory were developed to explain some of the phenomena, none, ultimately, was deemed more satisfactory than atomic theory. Atomic theory was finally accepted or confirmed for four reasons. First, on the current theories the phenomena in question are extremely unlikely and unexplained-or not well explained. Second, given the atomic theory, the phenomena in ques- tion are quite likely to occur. As we said before, the phenomena are not at 39 See Swinburne, The Existence of God (n. 3 above); and George Schlesinger, Religion and Scien- tific Method (Dordrecht: Dordrecht-Reidel, 1977), pp. 140-201. 40 Our discussion will preserve the probabilistic insights but will omit the technical machinery of the probability calculus. 76</page><page sequence="19">Proofs of God's Existence all expected on the current nonatomic theories and, given those theories, the phenomena are quite improbable. Atomic theory leads one to expect and, therefore, raises the probability of the phenomena in question. Third, atomic theory unites the otherwise unrelated phenomena under a single explanation. Each particular phenomenon had been explained by a different theory, and the phenomena were treated as discrete and unre- lated. Atomic theory was accepted, in part, because of its ability to relate otherwise poorly explained and disparate phenomena by a single theory. The argument is cumulative, whereby one takes all of the phenomena as evidence for the theory rather than considering them individually. Finally, atomic theory was accepted because it was deemed an intrinsi- cally plausible hypothesis. An alternative hypothesis that equally explains the data is the little known Tiny Elf theory. On this theory the phenomena are explained by the behavior of tiny and invisible elves. They behave in such a way as to explain the data as precisely as atomic theory. For exam- ple, the elves draw irregular lines at unexpected times in cloud chambers (feisty elves are particularly suited to explain the apparently capricious atomic phenomena). Why has the Tiny Elf theory not won the day within the scientific community? The reason is that it is not considered to be at all plausible. The problem is not one of not explaining the data (which it does on a par with atomic theory), itjust does not seem very likely to members of the scientific community. Hence, it is rejected only because it fails the fourth condition for the confirmation of a theory: it is not considered intrinsically likely or plausible. Our discussion reveals that in order for a scientific theory to be con- firmed by certain phenomena it must satisfy the following four condi- tions: (1) the phenomena in question must be improbable or unlikely or unexpected without the theory (or on background knowledge alone); (2) the theory must raise the probability of the phenomena, that is, the the- ory must make the phenomena likely or lead one to expect them; (3) the theory should unite otherwise disparate phenomena (its effect must be cumulative); (4) the theory must have sufficient initial or intrinsic plausi- bility or likelihood. Swinburne applies the above conditions to the confirmation of the hy- pothesis of theism. He takes the existence and design of the world, reli- gious experiences, morality and human consciousness, evil and miracles as the phenomena to be explained, and he argues that God is the best expla- nation of the phenomena. His argument for the existence of God is, ulti- mately, a cumulative argument, wherein he takes all of the evidence together and unites it under the hypothesis of theism. His argument may be stated quite simply. It is unlikely that a universe of this complexity would exist without the hypothesis of theism (on background knowledge alone the existence of this universe is exceedingly improbable). The 77</page><page sequence="20">The Journal of Religion hypothesis that there is a wholly good, omnipotent personal being would lead one to expect a world like ours (the hypothesis of theism significantly raises the probability of the existence of the world). A whole host of dispa- rate phenomena may be explained by the hypothesis of theism. And finally Swinburne believes that the hypothesis of theism has sufficient intrinsic initial plausibility (which he calculates in terms of simplicity). His cosmological argument is summarized as follows: "There is quite a chance that if there is a God he will make something of the finitude and complex- ity of a universe. It is very unlikely that a universe would exist uncaused, but rather more likely that God would exist uncaused. The existence of the universe is strange and puzzling. It can be made comprehensible if we suppose that it is brought about by God. This supposition postulates a sim- pler beginning of explanation than does the supposition of the existence of an uncaused universe, and that is grounds for believing the former sup- position to be true."41 He believes that it is quite likely that God exists, that it is more likely that the world came about if God created it than by chance processes, and hence that the balance of probabilities comes out strongly in favor of the hypothesis of theism.42 In terms of the four conditions that must be met for a hypothesis to be confirmed, Swinburne's argument can be outlined as follows: 1. The existence and design of the world (including morality, free moral agents, religious experience, etc.) are extremely improbable without the hypoth- esis of theism. 2. The hypothesis of theism significantly raises the probability of the existence and design of the world. 3. The hypothesis of theism explains and unites under a single hypothesis an otherwise disparate and unlikely set of phenomena (the existence and design of the world, religious experience, miracles, evil, etc.). 4. The hypothesis of theism has sufficient intrinsic plausibility. While it must be recognized that Swinburne's argument relies upon an allegedly objective interpretation of the probabilities assigned to condi- tions 1-3, it must also be noted that his assurance of God's existence is also a reflection of his underlying commitment to theism-as captured in con- dition 4; Swinburne believes that this is an objective probability, deter- mined by the simplicity of the hypothesis of theism. J. L. Mackie believes that the evidence comes out against theism and clearly favors the materialistic hypothesis. Mackie disagrees with Swinburne as to the relative judgments regarding conditions 1-3 and also disagrees on condition 4, the plausibility condition. He believes that the 41 Swinburne, The Existence of God, pp. 131-32. 42 Ibid., p. 291. 78</page><page sequence="21">Proofs of God's Existence world is not unlikely without the hypothesis of theism and that the natur- alistic hypothesis can adequately explain the phenomena in question. How does Mackie come to a different assessment of the initial plausibility of the hypothesis of theism? Mackie believes that it is very unlikely on our evi- dence that there exist disembodied persons since all of our experience of persons is as embodied. Since the orthodox conception of God is that he is disembodied, he believes that God's existence is, therefore, quite unlikely. Since he believes that the existence of the world can be accounted for quite well by strictly natural processes, that the existence of evil counts heavily against the existence of an orthodox God and that theism is intrin- sically implausible, Mackie concludes, "The balance of probabilities, therefore, comes out strongly against the existence of God."43 The crucial point here is that Mackie's fundamental commitments about the nature of reality determine which hypothesis he accepts to explain the existence and design of the world. How can one's fundamental commitments play such a role in accepting and rejecting hypotheses? Let us consider another example that illustrates this point. There is, in the world today, only one known set of all female sextuplets. The odds against this event have been calculated at over one billion to one. Now suppose one wanted to determine or explain why such an event occurred. Let us suppose that there are only two competing hypotheses: direct divine intervention and a naturalistic hypothesis. We already know that on the naturalistic hypothesis the event is extremely improbable. Is it possible for a theistic hypothesis to raise that probability? The theistic hypothesis might include one's beliefs that it is not unlikely for God to intervene directly into the procreative act, that God has a pen- chant for the fairer sex which would be determined by the fact that of all those born more than 50 percent are female, and that six is the perfect number. Without the theistic hypothesis the event is extremely unlikely, and with the hypothesis the event is more likely. I will omit consideration of its ability to explain a disparate body of data since there is only a single phenomenon under investigation, although one could likewise explain all multiple births by divine intervention. Now which hypothesis is one rationally constrained to accept given the evidence? It is not yet clear given the factors that have been considered. Even though the theistic hypothesis greatly raises the probability, one might not be rationally inclined to accept it because one might believe that it is not an initially plausible hypothesis for the event in question. If one thinks that the naturalistic hypothesis for procreation has the most initial plausibility, then one will surely believe the naturalistic hypothesis even though the event to be explained is extremely unlikely given that hypoth- 43 Mackie (n. 3 above), p. 253. 79</page><page sequence="22">The Journal of Religion esis. Even though the odds are over one billion to one against the event's occurring given a naturalistic explanation of procreation, one might still rationally believe that the event came about as a result of natural pro- cesses. What one is rationally constrained to believe in this matter is pri- marily a function of one's prior commitments to the competing hypotheses in question. Even a theist would probably accept the naturalis- tic hypothesis for the sextuplet example. And his acceptance of that hypothesis will primarily be a function of his initial commitments to a nat- uralistic hypothesis for procreation. This raises a crucial question for arguments like Swinburne's or Mackie's: are there objective means for determining rational initial plausi- bilityjudgments? The literature on this matter is inconclusive and exceed- ingly technical.44 I believe that the literature raises two significant points. Either there are no rational initial probability assignments at all, or, if there are any, they are not easily accessible to all rational creatures. How initially likely is it that God exists or that naturalism be true? These initial plausibility estimations are to be made without reference to any factual information at all; they are made on the sole basis of logical and mathe- matical truths.45 And it is hard to see what is the probability of God's exis- tence or that naturalism is true simply given such information as "2 + 2 = 4," "All bachelors are unmarried," and "Every statement is either true or false," and so forth. This would seem to imply that there aren't any initial plausibility judgments at all. But even if there are, how would one know what they are? It seems to me that the probability of God's existence is 100 percent.46 However, I do not know how to persuade someone who does not believe in God's existence that he, too, is rationally constrained to accept my judgment. All we can do in this manner is swap intuitions; the determinations are made, I have said, on the basis of no factual informa- tion, so it is hard to see what sorts of information one could possibly bring to bear that would decide the matter.47 Even if there are objective, initial 44 See, e.g., Wesley Salmon, The Foundations of Scientific Inference (Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 1966), pp. 65-96; Alvin Plantinga, "The Probabilistic Argument from Evil," Philosophical Studies 35 (1979): 1-53; Paul Horwich, Probability and Evidence (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1982), pp. 16-50. 45 These are called "a priori probabilities": probabilities that are calculated prior to any par- ticular facts that are relevant to the hypothesis. 46 I believe that God's existence is logically necessary; since God's nonexistence is impossible, the likelihood of his existence must be certain and the probability of God's existence is, there- fore, 1. An insight from the ontological argument that both the theist and the nontheist can share is that either God's existence or God's nonexistence is necessary. Hence, the probability of God's existence is either 1 or 0. 47 In fairness to Swinburne, it should be recognized that he argues for his determinations of prior probabilities on the basis of simplicity. He believes that the simple is more likely to be true and that the theistic hypothesis is quite simple and much more simple than the existence of a com- plex physical universe. Hence, for Swinburne, the assessment of prior probabilities is not merely 80</page><page sequence="23">Proofs of God's Existence plausibility judgments, their inaccessibility entails that all rational crea- tures are not constrained to agree about those judgments. How is this relevant to our discussion of theistic arguments? I believe that this compellingly illustrates the thesis that the power of a theistic proof is a function of what one already believes. Suppose that one amasses a set of probabilities that demonstrates that the probability that the world exists given natural processes is one in ten billion. Certainly the world's existence is much more likely given the hypothesis of theism. Nonetheless, one is not thereby committed to the rational acceptance of the hypothesis of theism.48 One must also consider the fourth condition for the confirmation of hypotheses: the intrinsic likelihood of the hypothesis in question. If one believes that it is likely that a God should exist, then one will be rationally moved to accept the hypothesis of the- ism given the evidence; if, like Mackie, one believes that God's existence is implausible, one may not thereby be moved to embrace that hypothe- sis even given a great deal of evidence (any more than one is compelled to be so moved in the sextuplet example). In conclusion, it is evident that Swinburne has not produced a success- ful, albeit probabilistic, piece of natural theology. His argument crucially relies on initial plausibility judgments about which all rational creatures are not compelled to agree. Hence, he has not constructed a piece of suc- cessful neoclassical natural theology. V. CONCLUSION I have now considered several paradigm arguments for the existence of God: Taylor's cosmological argument, Paley's argument from design, Plantinga's ontological argument, and Swinburne's new probabilistic approach. Of course, there are many others that could have been consid- ered: Aquinas's Five Ways, Kant's moral argument, John Henry Newman's cumulative argument, and arguments from religious experi- ence, arguments from miracles, for example. I have chosen, however, to a matter of intuitiveness. This simply pushes my thesis back one step: the arguments that he employs surely will not persuade all rational creatures. Why, a priori, is the simple more likely to be true? Perhaps there is a metaphysical proclivity toward abundance and a profound ontological disgust for parsimony; perhaps there is an a priori propensity for ontological abundance: for cab- bages and kings, electrons and ordinary, middle-sized objects, and for triune Gods and the like. It is hard to see how the matter could be settled on a priori grounds alone. 48 There are a whole host of intrinsically unlikely propositions that we rationally accept (for a variety of reasons); that water boils exactly when it does, that the acceleration of gravity has just the value that it has, etc. Given the infinite options for many of our beliefs, their intrinsic likeli- hood, based on nothing but logical tautologies, will be infinitesimally small. Yet, it is perfectly rational to believe them. Again, the intrinsic unlikelihood of the case in question is not the only determinate factor in making judgments. 81</page><page sequence="24">The Journal of Religion take only the aforementioned arguments as paradigm cases. It has been argued that none of these constitutes a successful proof of the existence of God. That is, these arguments neither employ premises that all rational creatures are obliged to accept nor use unproblematic argument forms. I also argued that in order to have a successful proof one must be able to persuade one's interlocutors that they ought to accept the crucial prem- ises of the argument but that the success of this project depends, typically, upon what one already believes about God. In particular, they fail the convincingness criterion: they typically employ premises that one is inclined to accept only if one already accepts the conclusion. Though these arguments be rejected as proofs, they may nonetheless provide argument or evidence for one's belief. For example, even though the argument from design does not constitute a proof of the Cre- ator God of the Bible, marks of design surely provide evidence for that belief. Of course, the thinking theist will have to recognize that there are a number of competing hypotheses that are consistent with the evidence. Nonetheless, the theist will not think of all of the competing hypotheses as having equal intrinsic merit, and all of the hypotheses will not be con- sidered equally worthy of rational consideration. The theist's intuitions on these matters will be a reflection of his commitments about the ulti- mate nature of reality. If one is inclined to see the world as the creation of an intelligent and benevolent being, then one will surely prefer those hypotheses that postulate something analogous to the human person to explain the existence of the world. If one is committed to the belief that the universe was created by blind and random actions and reactions, then one will not be kindly disposed toward hypotheses that wantonly multiply the kinds of entities that populate the universe-if one can explain everything by physical processes, why consider hypotheses that needlessly increase the kinds of things there are; that is, why needlessly believe that in addition to physical things and events there are also nonphysical things?49 The point is that the evidence is not unequivocal with respect to the competing hypotheses. The ambiguity of the evidence with respect to the competing hypothe- ses, however, ought not reflect poorly upon the theists' rationality, as the Humean and Kantian critics of theistic proofs contend. A similar sort of problem may be raised in the scientific sphere. Surely the evidence is not unequivocal for any scientific theory. Consider atomic theory: one could rationally refuse to apply the principle of sufficient reason beyond the 49 My description of the situation may be unduly propositional and epistemic. One's tempera- ment, as William James argues, may also play a role in the acceptance of the crucial premises: "Temperaments with their cravings and refusals do determine men in their philosophies, and always will" (William James, Pragmatism [Indianapolis: Hackett, 1981], p. 19). 82</page><page sequence="25">Proofs of God's Existence observable realm. This person would simply accept the quantum phenomena-marks in cloud chambers, oil drop experiments, the behav- ior of heated gases-as brute phenomena, without an explanation.50 Another possibility is to reject belief in unobservable quantum particles and attribute all of the quantum phenomena to the direct activity of God. Still another possibility is the Tiny Elf theory. In point of fact, there are an infinite number of theories that would fully explain the data in question. Some are more consistent with the background beliefs of rational crea- tures than others (this would unfortunately eliminate my Tiny Elf theory), but some competitors of atomic theory may reflect rational commitments. However, the existence of many possible explanations does not mean that the atomic theorist is intellectually defective or irrational in maintaining his belief. Surely the atomic phenomena constitute evidence for his belief, while all along he admits the possibility of other explanations. The same is true for the theist. Although he has not offered evidence that all rational creatures are ineluctably obliged to accept, he has offered evidence that some rational creatures may rationally accept. The theist, in this case, is at best rational and at worst not irrational in maintaining belief in God.5 All that has been impugned is the apologetic power of the proofs, not the theist's rationality. And, just as no one needs a proof to rationally believe in atoms and electrons on the basis of the evidence, one surely does not need a proof to be rational in maintaining belief in God on the basis of the evidence. Although there are no proofs of God's existence, there is nonetheless evidence for the existence of God. There are no proofs, but there is evidence.52 Furthermore, the fact that other rational people disagree in their estimations of the evidence does not entail that the theist is irrational. If this were true, then it would also follow that the nontheist is irrational because the theist disagrees with him. The simple fact of rational disagreement does not mean that the theist does not have good evidence for his belief. 50 This is a live option that has been powerfully defended by Bas Van Fraassen in his The Scien- tific Image (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1980), pp. 6-40; for his satirical reflections on theistic proofs, see pp. 204-15. 51 He may be able to establish a right to believe while not demonstrating that it is rationally incumbent on all rational creatures to believe. 52 It is also not clear that the theist requires an argument or evidence in order to be rational; see Plantinga, "Reason and Belief in God" (n. 17 above), pp. 16-63; and Kelly James Clark, Return to Reason (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans, in press), chap. 4. Even the great rationalist Hegel is suspect of the necessity of theistic proofs: "The (now somewhat antiquated) metaphysical proofs of God's existence, for example, have been treated, as if a knowledge of them and a con- viction of their truth were the only and essential means of producing a belief and conviction that there is a God. Such a doctrine would find its parallel, if we said that eating was impossible before we acquired a knowledge of the chemical, botanical, and zoological characters of our food; and we must delay digestion till we had finished the study of anatomy and physiology" (as quoted in Frederick G. Weiss, Hegel: The Essential Writings [New York: Harper, 1974], pp. 20-21). 83</page><page sequence="26">The Journal of Religion What we have illustrated is Mavrodes' claim that it is typically difficult to construct a theistic proof that all rational creatures are obliged to accept. In particular, theistic arguments fail as proofs because the nontheist may not be rationally obliged to accept the major premise and the theist will typically accept it, in part, because of his commitment to the conclusion, thereby violating the convincingness criterion. But again, that does not necessarily impugn the theist's rationality. Given that the issues raised typically preclude the possibility of constructing proofs, we can nonetheless construct arguments for the existence of God. We should affirm more modestly than Mavrodes (substituting argument for proof): Why, then, should not each of us make use of his own knowledge, and extend it by argument if he can, even if it happens not to be universally shared? It would seem foolish for anyone else to construe another's ignorance as a limit upon his own intellectual life. Conversely, we should not make anyone else's ignorance a barrier to whatever advance we might be able to make. The notion of a proof as construed in [Sec. I above and illustrated throughout the essay] takes account of the fact that not every piece of knowledge is universally shared. It also recognizes that one person's knowledge may properly be used as a basis upon which some further advance for that person can be built. There is no reason why an advance of that sort should not be a suitable project for a natural theologian.53 53 Mavrodes (n. 1 above), pp. 46-47. 84</page></plain_text>
