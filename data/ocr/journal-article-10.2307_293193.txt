<plain_text><page sequence="1">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY. Lex Hortensia of 287 B. C. all nundinae were made dies fasti, and the term comitialis was introduced and affixed to 195 days previ- ously marked fasti. The Lex Acilia of 191 B. C. simply ordered the pontiffs to adjust the calendar; in the next year, the calendar was four months ahead of the solar year. The Lex Aelia and the Lex Fufia of about 150 B. C. forbade the holding of comitia between the announcement of a date for elections and the day of elections; and this may relate to the synchronization of the consular and calendar years in 153 B. C. The Lex Caecilia Didia of 98 B. C. made a trinum nundinum the period between the promulgatio and the rogatio of a law. This is merely a bald outline of the author's conclusions and does not reflect the hesitancy of her reasoning on many points or this reviewer's agreement with her. Throughout the book, Mrs. Michels indicates that there is a large amount of hypothesis and speculation in her argument. This is necessarily so in any treatment of the Roman calendar, especially in its early phases, so Mrs. Michels' book is certainly not the final word on this subject. In addition to the element of uncertainty in her argument, there appears to be an unresolved bias toward astronomical explanations: in chapter 1 she seems to discount such considerations, but in chapters 6 and 7 her thoughts frequently reflect an assumption that the Roman calendar contains at least lost references to astronomical facts. The development of the calendar, as Mrs. Michels sees it, is an interesting reconstruction; but I would suggest that, like all of us who have written about the calendar in recent years, she may be too preoccupied with the concept that there was a continuous de- velopment; this may not be true, and I wish that she had examined further the distinctions which she makes (pp. 98-9) between con- sular and calendar years and between civil and religious calendars. It now appears to me that some elements remained constant while others changed, so that there was quite often an overlapping of the new and the traditional. The book is well made, and I have noted only a few errors: "owned" for "owed" (p. 80), "exidence" for "evidence" (p. 165), a misplaced title-page (p. 221, repeated in a different font on the right page, 229), and irregular margins in the whole section of quotations from Censorinus and Macrobius, pp. 150-9.

(Cornell Studies in Classical Philology, XXXV.) Professor North's book, an expansion and extension of her doc- toral dissertation (" The Concept of Sophrosyne in Greek Thought from Homer to Aristotle" [Cornell University, 1945, unpublished]), is a study in depth of one of the major Greek virtues. As such it 360</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS. both calls for and deserves close attention. Sophrosyne (I shall follow Miss North's example and not italicize the noun) is beyond doubt the most complex of the Greek virtues, and her careful, de- tailed treatment does justice to this complexity. Five chapters treat the development down through Plato. The subtitle is misleading, however, for further chapters go on to deal with " Philosophy after Plato," "Literary and Popular Usage after Plato," "Sophrosyne in Rome," and " Sophrosyne in Patristic Literature." An appendix (pp. 380-6), on "Imagery Related to Sophrosyne," even glances at the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. In this long, intricate history Plato is the focal point: focal because it was he above all others who gave sophrosyne its final definition in the Greek ethical system. By placing it at the heart of the canon of the four "cardinal" virtues, in intimate reciprocal relationship with justice and in correlation with the structure of both the state and the human soul, Plato completed the process of making sophrosyne the quintessential " Greek virtue." At the outset, however, we must take note of a troublesome terminological-if it is not actually a philosophical-difficulty. To what extent can we recognize the existence, i. e., the acknowledged existence, of a virtue when there is no word to designate it? Miss North herself notes the great rarity of the noun sophrosyne in all periods of Greek literature down to the late fifth century B. C. The adjective s6phron and the verb sophronein are less uncommon, but they are also very variable in meaning and do not give any clear indication of a semantic center from which one can build. This is an important question, to which I will return below. The story begins then, as most stories begin, with the Homeric poems. Miss North notes (p. 2) that "sophrosyne is not a 'heroic' virtue" and speaks (ibid.) of "the tension between the 'heroic' and the 'moderate,' the ' spirited' and the ' gentle,' the agathos and the s6phr6n, which is one of the persistent themes of Greek litera- ture." (Her case would have been stronger, however, if she had not bracketed the Homeric Achilles and Ajax as examples of the oppo- site of sophrosyne. Sophocles' Ajax is so, Homer's is not.) The adjective saophron appears just twice in Homer, in Iliad, XXI, 462, in the mouth of Apollo-an eccentric case-and in Odyssey, IV, 158, where Peisistratus refers to the youthful modesty of Telemachus. The noun saophrosyne appears twice also, in two passages just seventeen lines apart in a single book of the Odyssey: XXIII, 13 and 30 (a notable fact in itself). The second instance refers to Telemachus' " acts of prudence" in concealing his father's plans: an interesting early use of the "concrete plural" of a so- called abstract noun (cf. atasthalieisi). The other passage, con- sisting of a remark by Penelope to the old nurse, is more important, perhaps the most important passage involving the word saophrosyne before the late fifth century. " The gods have made you mad," says Penelope, "they who can make the sensible man a fool (aphron) and bring the light-minded to saophrosyne." A paradigm is implied here, a contrast between the man whose wits the gods have destroyed (aesiphron, Miss North proposes to call him) and the one whose "wits are intact, undamaged." Thus the basic thrust of the word saovhr6n is prudential or intellectual; but this is in a world where 361</page><page sequence="3">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY. "to know glorious or unseemly things" means to intend them: in short, a world where knowledge and will tend to be identified. Thanks to this antinomy or ambiguity the Ionian tradition in- herited, by and large, an intellectual (i. e., prudential) conception of sophrosyne-" keeping one's wits about one "-while the Dorian part of the Greek world developed a more ethical and political view. Here s6phron came to designate the 'soundness' of character of the born aristocrat, or of the people who submitted to aristocratic rule: e.g., Theognis, 1081-2 (p. 17). According to Miss North, it was Theognis and his imitators who established a far-reaching in- novation, " the use of sophrosyne as an antonym of hybris in both public and private life" (p. 16). It is also in the Theognidea, vs. 1138, that Sophrosyne first appears personified, in place of Aid6s, in the company of Pistis, Good Faith, and the Charites, Graces, who have abandoned mankind and returned to Olympus. Yet in Theognis also the adjective s6phron normally has its prudential meaning: "wise, with one's wits about him." The archaic period of Greek literature is of course the one in which the principles of measure, proportion, restraint, came to the fore. " Measure is best! " "Nothing too much!" " Know thyself! " (namely, as mortal man, not god). But this cluster of ideas, which we associate especially with Solon and the Seven Wise Men, is not expressed in the archaic age itself by s6phron or sophrosyne (pp. 10-11). With Attic tragedy (Chapter II) we reach a new level of explicit- ness in presentation of the antinomy between sophrosyne and hybris, or more generally between heroic arete and the restrictions which the social or the world order imposes, or attempts to impose, on it. Miss North's characterizations of the three tragedians in this context have much truth (pp. 32-3): Aeschylus plays up the conflict; Sophocles "interprets sophrosyne chiefly as the power to recognize reality and identifies it closely with self-knowledge "; " to Euripides sophrosyne is one aspect of the rational element, eternally in con- flict with the irrational." She might perhaps have emphasized even more than she does the extent to which these three views or ap- proaches are variations on a single theme. The energy which per- vades Greek culture, and therefore Greek literature, from Homer to Euripides springs above all from the polar tension between un- inhibited assertion of individual will (characteristically, but not always, that of the hero in the Homeric sense) and the enveloping cosmic, moral, and/or political order. Sophrosyne, in its fully de- veloped sense, obviously denotes some kind of awareness and accept- ance of the claims of that order. At this point, however, I recur to a misgiving which has already been expressed above as to Miss North's procedure. She says in her preface (p. ix): For the early period it seemed imperative to take into account the existence of the concept of sophrosyne, even when ex- pressed in other terms. The heroic and archaic ages afford many examples of the appearance under some other name of what is later recognized as sophrosyne. As the narrative progresses, one repeatedly encounters statements like this (p. 7): 362</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS. It is irrelevant that this saving power of restraint or com- punction is never, in the epic, linked with the word sophrosyne. The feeling is older than the word. Or this (p. 30): Aeschylus, from whose plays has been constructed a table of opposites not unlike the Pythagorean, consistently ranges soph- rosyne and what is limited, measured, or restrained on the side of the Good. Similarly, reference is made (p. 16) to "sophrosyne in its Homeric sense." Yet Miss North herself records that the word sophrosyne appears only twice in the Homeric poems, in the single passage of Odyssey XIX, and that Aeschylus does not employ the word at all. Indeed, on her own showing, the noun sophrosyne is not used by any Greek author before Euripides, except-and the exceptions are of some interest-Theognis and one instance in a Simonidean epitaph. Can one speak of a "concept" (e. g., p. 32) or an "essence" (p. 35) which has no name, or whose supposed name is never used by those who are presumably treating and developing it? For Miss North repeatedly speaks of "development" (e.g., p. 13), "process" (pp. 9-10), "progress" (p. 23), "emergence" of soph- rosyne. This is more than a verbal quibble. The question at issue is precisely whether there was such a thing as a single concept or essence of sophrosyne before Plato, or at any rate before the time of the Sophists. The assumption that it existed, e. g., in the sixth century, and was then in process of development towards a known goal, seems to be a case of what the philosopher Whitehead used to call "mis- placed concreteness"; or perhaps it would be better to refer to Aristotelian entelechic concepts. In any case there is no room to argue the matter here, only to refer to the nagging doubt. With Chapter III, " The Age of the Sophists," there can be no doubt that we are in the presence of a word and a concept, though one about which there is still much uncertainty and disagreement. Miss North brings out particularly well the ambiguities which attend the use of sophrosyne in Thucydides, and both in this chapter and the next (on Xenophon and the orators) she shows with admirable clarity how, after the oligarchic excesses of 411 and especially of 404-3, sophrosyne loses for good its surviving aristocratic over- tones (allied with apragmosyne, etc.) and settles down, at least in Athens, to be a regular democratic virtue. With Plato (Chapter V), as was said before, we come to a turning point. The incorporation of sophrosyne in the fixed scheme of the Four Virtues gives it a new firmness of definition. It now becomes, especially in the Republic (see especially 432A), a virtue both of the whole and of each part, a harmony, "a symphonia of the naturally inferior and the naturally superior on the question which should rule" (p. 173). With all deference to Miss North, how- ever, I think some ambiguity or unclarity remains in the Republic, between sophrosyne as the specific virtue of the lower class (more or less = obedience ') and sophrosyne as a general harmony per- vading the whole state. Does the naturally superior element or class require a separate virtue to persuade it that it should rule? Is that 363</page><page sequence="5">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY. not inherent in its nature (justice, 'doing its own work,' meaning in this case precisely 'to rule ')? In any case Miss North is right in emphasizing how Plato here has moved away from a purely in- tellectualistic view of sophrosyne (the Charmides, for example, tried to define it as some kind of knowledge). The soul as an ordering (kosmos) or harmony, and sophrosyne as the principle of that harmony: these ideas clearly owe something to the Pythagoreans. From another point of view, Plato is at one with his time in seeing the essence of sophrosyne in the control of appetite by reason, but the system into which he incorporates that idea is purely his own. How much his own can be gauged by comparison, e. g., with Aristotle, who never speaks of sophrosyne in any political sense (p. 207) but considers it purely as a virtue of the individual, namely the control of passion (see Eth. Nic., 1179b13 if.); hence its im- portance in the educational process (ibid., 34). This individualistic view of sophrosyne remains, indeed, the standard one in both philosophical (e. g., Chrysippus and the older Stoa; p. 219) and non-philosophical circles (e. g., in New Comedy; p. 243), where s6phr6n most often refers to sexual chastity and a kosmios kai sophron aner is simply a " decent, respectable " citizen (Samia, 129), without any political implications. Miss North goes far in emphasizing the alienness of sophrosyne to the Roman temperament. But this is true rather of the concept as a whole-if we can speak of it as a whole-and does not exclude important affinities in detail. As she says, frugality, self-control, and chastity, at least feminine chastity, were always considered to belong to the mos maiorum, and from the second century on the accepted picture of that ill-defined but important aggregate of prejudices was deeply affected by Greek theories. A long list of expressions-such words as pudens, frugi, castus, modestus, moder- atus, temperatus, sobrius, etc.,-attests Roman devotion to what can be considered aspects of sophrosyne. The vitality (i. e., the alive- ness) of these ideas is well illustrated from the second century by the little song in the Mostellaria (120 ff.) in which Philolaches, the self-styled young reprobate, laments the loss of his verecundia, his virtutis modus, his fides, his decus; and from the end of the Re- public by the gorgeously allegorical passage of the Second Catili- narian (11,25; mis-cited as 2,25 on p. 277) in which the ranks of Pudor, Pudicitia, Fides, Pietas, Constantia, Honestas, fight on the one side and Petulantia, Stuprum, Fraudatio, Scelus, Furor, and Turpitudo on the other. Time does not permit further discussion of the Roman chapter, in which the treatment of Horace seems to me especially firm and sure. In her final chapter Miss North treats the vast topic of sophrosyne and its redefinition and re-evaluation by the Fathers of the Church. Beginning with the sense of the term which lay closest to hand in popular usage of the first century of our era, namely the control of appetites, and more specifically of sexual appetite, Christianity ended by assimilating sophrosyne, both the term and the concept, into the great central themes of imitation of God, purgation of the soul, and the practice of asceticism. In this process the Fathers, especially the Cappadocians and Augustine, were increasingly-if onesidedly-influenced by Plato. Miss North's long and careful study 364</page><page sequence="6">REVIEWS. concludes fittingly with a sympathetic, balanced account of temper- antia in St. Augustine: the entrance portal to the Middle Ages. A mixed bag of notes on minor points: Pp. 4-5: when Apollo uses saophron of himself (Iliad, XXI, 462), he is exemplifying Homer's most extreme anthropomorphism. Gods are not normally called upon to be s6phrones.-P. 6: aidos, nemesis, and sophrosyne: Dodds' (The Greeks and the Irrational) 'shame culture' and 'guilt culture' should have been referred to.-P. 7: " Homeric society . .. places a high value on aid6s, but the hero himself, qua hero, is not obliged to respect it." The participants in the Embassy (Iliad, IX), especially Ajax, do not seem to have been informed of this exemption.-Pp. 26-7, on self-knowledge in Heraclitus: i8tl- aadLrv ueovTro'v! (Fr. 101 D-K).-P. 36: on Aeschylus' Suppliants: especially good remarks on the Danaids' distorted view of sophro- syne.-P. 39: I welcome Miss North's statement that Eteocles (in the Seven Against Thebes) " is at first completely sophron and then suddenly (at line 653), when the Erinys strikes, completely the reverse."-Pp. 43-4: Good remarks on the tyrannical Zeus of the Prometheus Bound, but the comparison with the Oresteia is no help here. Zeus is never characterized as a tyrant at any point in the Oresteia, early or late.-Pp. 45-6 bring out well the virtual equiva- lence of phronein and sophronein for Aeschylus.-P. 48, on "the theme of fear ": a reference to J. de Romilly, La crainte et l'angoisse dans le theatre d'Eschyle, would have been in order. But enough. The book is carefully and gracefully written, and very carefully proofread. The only inconsistent spelling that sticks in the mind is aretae, with a Latinate -ae. We are much indebted to Professor North for this painstaking investigation and not only look forward to her next publication along the same line but hope that her work may stimulate others to undertake comparable studies of the major Greek virtues, and indeed of the concept of arete itself.
