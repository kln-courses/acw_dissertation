<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOCIAL PROBLEMS, Vol. 27, No. 4, April 1980 THREE MODELS OF ORGANIZATIONAL CORRUPTION IN AGENCIES OF SOCIAL CONTROL* LAWRENCE W. SHERMAN State University of New York at Albany In this paper I examine the processes by which agencies of social control become organizationally corrupt, as one instance of the more general social problem of organizations adopting deviant goals. I define organizational corruption, and present three models of how it may develop: (1) the co-optation by social control agencies of the subjects of control; (2) the capture of social control agencies by external ex- ploiters of the "power to regulate" as a marketable commodity; and (3) the domina- tion of the agency by internal exploiters of the marketability of regulatory authority. I explore and illustrate the conditions under which each model is found and suggest some tasks for future theoretical work. One of Sutherland's greatest contributions to the sociological study of crime was his concep- tion of organizations as deviant actors. Yet for almost forty years this contribution was all but ig- nored. Partly because Sutherland (1940, 1949) was inconsistent and contradictory in his use of the concept (Shapiro, 1976), and partly because sociologists of crime have been preoccupied with ex- plaining the behavior of individuals, Sutherland's critics have been able to discredit the concept of deviant organizations as "economic anthropomorphism" (Geis, 1962). Bloch and Geis, for ex- ample, flatly pronounce that, "For the purposes of criminological analysis, .... corporations can- not be considered persons" (1970:306). This narrow position not only ignores a major problem for inquiry into such central criminological concerns as violence and theft (Schrager and Short, 1978), it also ignores one of the most consequential shifts in the social structure of Western societies over the past several centuries: the emergence of organizations as the most powerful "persons" in society (Coleman, 1973, 1974). In recent years, however, a growing number of sociologists have either employed or implied the concept of organizations as criminal or deviant actors, in both conceptual discussions (Reiss, 1966; Wheeler, 1976; Ermann and Lundman, 1978; Schrager and Short, 1978; Shover, 1978) and in research on such problems as consumer fraud in auto repairs (Leonard and Weber, 1970), police corruption (Sherman, 1978; Lundman, 1979) and occupational safety violations (Pearson, 1978). The concept of organizational deviance has become more widely accepted, but it has rarely been treated as a variable. Very little of the existing work on organizational deviance has at- tempted to explain why some organizations and not others engage in deviant conduct, or why some commit more deviant acts than others. The one theoretical framework that has been employed to answer this question, strain theory, was adapted from the individual level of ex- planation (Merton, 1968:Chapter VI), and it often fits the facts it is used to explain; but the strain theory explanations have been necessarily confined to organizational deviance involving the use of illegitimate means to achieve societally legitimate goals. Organizational deviance involving the adoption of societally illegitimate organizational goals has yet to be explained. The apparently growing social problem of corporations that lose money or go bankrupt through planned internal or external exploitation, religious organizations that deprive their members of liberty and life, and other organizations that invert (and not just displace) their manifest socially approved goals still await sociological examination as a general phenomenon. One fertile area for developing theories of why organizations adopt deviant goals is the broad * I wish to thank David Duffee, Michael Gottfredson, Clinton Terry and several anonymous reviewers for offering comments on an earlier draft of this paper, presented to the American Society of Criminology, Dallas, Texas, November, 1978.</page><page sequence="2">Organizational Corruption 479 category of agencies of official social control, defined as those organizations empowered by society to deprive people and organizations of their material wealth, their liberty or their lives.' The extensive literature on the corruption of social control agencies provides some basic descrip- tive material in which patterns of the adoption of deviant goals may be observed. After defining social control corruption and distinguishing its individual from its organizational forms, I present three models of the processes by which social control agencies adopt corrupt gain as an organiza- tional goal and suggests some hypotheses about the conditions under which each model typically occurs. First, however, the unavoidable threshold issue that has stymied so much work on organizational deviance must be addressed: whether organizations are real actors. ARE ORGANIZATIONS REAL, MORAL ACTORS? The long dominant sociological view of organizations is that they have no reality apart from the existence of their members (Simon, 1964). More recent sociological discussions of organiza- tions, however, speak of "the reality of organizations ... as independent of their members" (Al- drich, 1979:2) derived from their ability to generate the actions of individuals (Hall, 1977:23-27), so that strictly organizational factors account for part of the behavior of individuals at all times in organizations. In this restated position in a very old debate (cf. Warriner, 1956), organizations can be said to act when individual agents (cf. Coleman, 1974) of the organization act under the influence of organizational factors. Since their actions are real, organizations can logically be labeled as conforming to or deviating from moral norms. Whatever the philosophic objections might be to treating organizations as moral actors (e.g., Rawls, 1971:505), organizations are clearly defined as real in modern society. The legal system, for example, while struggling with several competing theories of how corporations are morally responsible for their acts, leaves no doubt that organizations are indeed to be held morally responsible; juries have even convicted corporations of crimes while acquitting individual cor- porate officers for the same offenses (Harvard Law Review, 1979b). Journalistic treatments and everyday language follow this conception. As Cohen (1966:21) points out, even philosophers and sociologists, when not engaged in disputing the reality of organizations, "do not doubt that the gas company" overcharged them or that "the university is not paying them what they are worth." The fact that much action in modern society is organizational action suggests that a con- ception of organizations as moral actors ought, at the least, to be admitted to the sociological floor for discussion; and the first question might well be why some organizations become cor- rupt. DEFINING ORGANIZATIONAL CORRUPTION The definitions of corruption in government vary widely among social scientists. Some defini- tions center on public office, while others use market situations or conceptions of the public in- terest, and other elements (Heidenheimer, 1970:4-6). The narrower category of corruption in agencies of social control may be most usefully defined in relation to the authority of public of- fice (Goldstein, 1975:3-5; Sherman, 1978:30), but all of the definitions include the element of private gain (usually financial, although power, prestige and perquisites could be included) for in- dividuals who exercise that authority. Those individuals include both the officials in whom the authority is formally vested and others who control those officials by participating in the agency's dominant administrative coalition. As Thompson (1967:128) defines it, the dominant coalition is a process (not an entity) in which 1. While it is often observed that organizations cannot be put in jail, they can be deprived of life (Coleman, 1974).</page><page sequence="3">480 SHERMAN certain individuals powerful enough to participate in any given decision determine the operative organizational goals: Almost inevitably this includes organizational members, but it may also incorporate significant outsiders. ... In this view, organizational goals are established by individuals-but interdependent individuals who collectively have sufficient control of organizational resources to commit them in certain directions and withhold them from others (1967:128). Corrupt acts by agents of social control may thus be defined as the illegal misuse of public authority by social control agents resulting in private gain for the agents or others participating in the agency's dominant coalition. This definition admittedly suffers from ambiguity about the key terms of "misuse" and its "resulting" in private gain. The term "misuse" opens the definition to a variety of conceptions of the public interest, and the term "result" belies the often complex causal connection between official decisions and private gain. A regulatory official, for example, who makes a decision favorable to a private corporation's interest and takes a highly paid posi- tion with that company five years later illustrates both problems. The example also illustrates the inadequacy of relying on official rules for a definition since the behavior in question is generally construed as perfectly legal and proper, but the broad legal definitions of bribery could con- ceivably be used to punish the behavior as illegal (see generally, Harvard Law Review, 1979a). This definition explicitly rejects a definition of corruption as illicit attainment of organiza- tional gain. The violation of laws in order to preserve or enhance the power or domain of an or- ganization is an important social problem, and one which is often found in agencies of social con- trol. But it is a distinct problem, with possibly distinct causes, from the problem of illicit attain- ment of individual gain. The boundaries of a definition of corruption are no more or less clearly defined than the boun- daries of definitions of all crime and deviance." Yet the definition of corruption probably enjoys more consensus than the choice of criteria for distinguishing organizational deviance from in- dividual deviance in organizations. Several definitions of organizational deviance have been sug- gested, but none of them has been widely adopted. One definition of organizational deviance suggests that four characteristics would have to be present in order for social control corruption to be organizational rather than individual (Ermann and Lundman, 1978:7-9); the actions must be: (1) supported by the internal operating norms of an organization; (2) justified to new organizational members through a process of socialization inculcating those norms; (3) supported by fellow workers in the organization; and (4) supported by the dominant administrative coalition of the organization. This definition of organizational deviance repeats Sutherland's error of confusing elements of causation with the elements of the behavior itself (Shapiro, 1976). Operating norms (which can vary widely from one organizational unit to the next), organizational socialization into a deviant activity, and peer group support may all help to explain why organizational deviance occurs, but those characteristics are neither necessary nor useful for distinguishing organizational from individual deviance. All three characteristics apply to crimes committed against organizations by their employees, such as sys- tematic employee theft (Mars, 1973), as well as to crimes committed by employees on behalf of their organizations, such as price-fixing (Geis, 1977). Only the fourth element of this definition (support by the dominant coalition) is essential for distinguishing deviance committed by in- dividuals as representatives of the organization from deviance committed by individuals as per- sonal actors. Another definition relies solely on the support of the organization's dominant coalition to determine whether deviance is organizational or individual (Sherman, 1978:4-5), a position con- 2. For evidence that problems of definition are still very much alive, see the exchange between Black (1979) and Gottfredson and Hindelang (1979a,b) with regard to victimization data.</page><page sequence="4">Organizational Corruption 481 sistent with at least one legal theory (Harvard Law Review, 1979b: 1250-1251). Whether a deviant act is committed against, within, or on behalf of an organization is thus defined by the operative or "real" goals of the organization, as distinct from the manifest or formal goals, and not by the nature of the act itself. Under this definition, employee theft from the organization, for example, would be individual deviance committed against the organization as long as the organization's operative goal set by the dominant coalition is to maximize profits (or for governmental and non- profit agencies, to keep down costs). But where employee theft is consistent with an operative organizational goal of maintaining internal harmony through "informal rewards" (Dalton, 1959:Chapter 7; Conklin, 1977:68) or of exploiting the organization's resources for the personal benefit of organizational employees (Raw et al., 1972), then it would constitute organizational deviance. The objective behavior is the same, but the different operative goals set by the domi- nant coalition define the consequences of the behavior for the organization's interests differently at any given point in time. When an individual acts "on behalf" of an organization, then, he or she is acting in accor- dance with the dominant coalition's operative goals. Thus it might seem appropriate to employ Shover's definition of organizational crime: ... criminal acts committed by individuals or groups of individuals ... during the normal course of their work as employees of organizations, which they intend to contribute to the achievement of goals or other objectives thought to be important for the organization as a whole, some subunit within the organization, or their own particular duties (1978:39). It is difficult or impossible, however, to assess an individual's intent, even with direct observation of behavior, either sociologically (Shapiro, 1976) or in a criminal prosecution (Schrager and Short, 1978:409-410). It is possible to observe communications from the dominant coalition to organizational members, and to observe whether the member's behavior is consistent with those messages. A more practicable operational definition of organizational crime, then, is: Illegal acts of omission or commission committed by an individual or a group of individuals in a legitimate formal organization in accordance with the operative goals of the organization, which have a serious physical or economic impact on employees, consumers or the general public (Schrager and Short, 1978:411-412). Rather than asking who benefits, the latter definition is more concerned with who is harmed and how much, something that is much easier to assess. The virtue of this definition, however, is also its failing. By including only clear cut cases of such serious harm as the Buffalo Creek Mining Disaster (Erikson, 1976), the definition excludes many deviant and criminal3 acts which actually cause physical or economic harm to no one, either because they do not have the potential to do so or because they did not have that result. Many forms of corruption in social control agencies would be excluded by the Schrager and Short definition. Police bribe-taking to allow gambling is a clear example; a bribe taken by a Food and Drug Administration official to approve a new drug that had not been adequately tested but which did not turn out to have harmful effects would be another. But the criterion of serious harm is only relevant to the definition of deviant acts per se; it does not affect their distinction between individual and organizational action on the basis of operative organizational goals. Three of the four definitions of organizational deviance (Ermann and Lundman, 1978; 3. By excluding illegal behavior that does not have a serious physical or economic impact, Schrager and Short solved the persistent problem of whether to call acts punishable by merely civil penalties "crime" (Sutherland, 1945; Tappan, 1947). In the process, however, they have allowed their own value judgment about impact to determine what will be labeled a crime, thereby violating the principle evident in their injunc- tion not to "label some legal actions as criminal on moral grounds" (1978:412). Instead, they opted to use moral grounds to label some criminal actions as noncriminal.</page><page sequence="5">482 SHERMAN Schrager and Short, 1978; Sherman, 1978), then, rely on the concept of operative organizational goals set by the dominant administrative coalition to distinguish individual and organizational ac- tion, and the fourth definition (Shover, 1978) implies a similar distinction. By combining this distinction with the admittedly provisional definition of social control corruption suggested above, organizational corruption in agencies of social control may be defined as the illegal misuse of public authority in accordance with operative organizational goals for the private gain of social control agents or others participating in the agency's dominant administrative coalition. THEORIES OF ORGANIZATIONAL DEVIANCE Given this definition of organizational corruption, the central problem is why some social con- trol organizations and not others adopt operative goals consistent with corruption, or even adopt corruption itself as an operative goal. This is a very different problem from the one addressed by existing theories of specific types of organizational deviance, most of which are confined to strain theory explanations of the organizational use of societally illegitimate means in accordance with societally legitimate organizational goals. For business organizations, the usual problem for ex- planation is why some and not others break the law in order to achieve the societally legitimate goal of making a profit (Lane, 1953; Leonard and Weber, 1970; Farberman, 1975; Geis, 1977; Sonnenfeld and Lawrence, 1978).' For government organizations, the usual problem for explana- tion is why some and not others break the law in attempting to achieve such legitimate public in- terest goals as maintaining order (Marx, 1972). None of these theories, however, can explain why a corporation would abandon the goal of profit making in order to milk corporate assets for the personal gain of organizational employees, or why a nursing home would abandon the goal of providing health care to the elderly in order to enrich its owners, or why a police department would abandon the goal of enforcing the law in favor of the goal of profiting from the sale of nonenforcement. Nor, for that matter, can the traditional theories of goal displacement, in which "an instrumental value becomes a terminal value" (Merton, 1968:253) or the imperatives of organizational survival "may lead to unan- ticipated consequences resulting in a deflection of original goals" (Selznick, 1949:259), explain the adoption of deviant goals. The displacement of one societally legitimate goal with another, such as the Tennessee Valley Authority's substitution of private land development for its original goal of conservation through public ownership, may enhance rather than threaten an organiza- tion's survival; but that is not necessarily the case for the adoption of a societally illegitimate goal. Even if the adoption of that goal enhances short-term prospects for survival and growth, in the long run it may make the organization vulnerable to punishment and even destruction. The problem of organizational corruption in official agencies of social control is unlike any other problem for which theories have already been suggested, and is part of a larger gap in the sociology of organizational deviance. As a problem of organizational behavior, it may be better understood with three concepts taken from the sociology of formal organizations: co-optation, capture and shelter. Each of these concepts provide the basis for a model of how social control agencies become organizationally corrupt. MODEL I: CO-OPTATION OF SUBJECTS OF CONTROL One common pattern of social control corruption is co-optation: the participation of the sub- jects of social control in the policy-making process of the agency. Corruption in federal 4. The legitimacy of profit making, of course, is by no means universal, and a deviant label is now often ap- plied to "excessive" profit levels, such as those of the oil companies (Parisi, 1979) during the energy crisis of 1973. But the idea of profit itself, it seems, is still far from being defined as deviant by a majority of the American public.</page><page sequence="6">Organizational Corruption 483 regulatory agencies is most often described in this manner, but local police departments some- times fit this pattern as well. The colloquial usage of the concept implies that the subjects of con- trol, threatened by the possibility that the control agencies will force them to cease their activity, "co-opt" the control agency by making control agents identify with the interests of the subjects of control. This imagery underlies the conventional interpretation of such behavior as Securities and Exchange Commission employees accepting free trips and hotel rooms from securities in- dustry groups (Conklin, 1977:123) or the "revolving door" through which employees of regulated industries move into regulatory agency employment and back again, as did more than half of the people appointed to nine of the federal regulatory agencies during 1970-75 (Burnham, 1975). Such "links" between the regulated and the regulators are said to reduce the effectiveness of the control process (Conklin, 1977:123; Skolnick, 1978:159-167). Both the concept of co-optation and this model of social control corruption are actually much more subtle than the conventional imagery. As Selznick (1949:13) originally defined it, "co- optation is the process of absorbing new elements into the leadership or policy-determining struc- ture of an organization as a means of averting threats to its stability or existence," with the conse- quence that the organization's character, role and operative goals may be modified. It is not the social control agencies which are co-opted; the regulators may pose a threat to the existence of the regulated, but there is little evidence that, for example, the Mafia families or other businesses ab- sorb social control agents into their leadership structures. Rather, in this model the reverse is true: the regulated pose a threat to the regulators, and the regulators absorb the regulated into their policy-making process of regulation. To have the regulated threaten the regulators when the power of societally legitimated coercion is on the side of the regulators may be counter-intuitive, but it makes sense from a sociological view of organizations. The regulated's threat derives from the organizational imperatives of the regulators. In order to accomplish (or appear to accomplish, through the production of enforce- ment statistics) their formal goal of regulation, the regulators may require expertise or informa- tion that is available only from the regulated (Wheeler, 1976). If the regulated withhold the infor- mation, expertise, or other resources that regulators require for accomplishing their formal goals, they may threaten the stability or survival of the regulators (Leavitt et al., 1978:271). In order to be assured of the resources for accomplishing their formal goals, the regulators may absorb the regulated into their policy-making structure. Once absorbed, however, the regulated may not only displace the formal goals of the regulators, they may also invert them completely, inducing the social control agency to adopt the deviant goal of selling its enforcement power. Local police detectives, for example, have always depended on burglars for the information necessary to arrest other burglars and to recover stolen property (Skolnick, 1966:126-137). In order to accomplish these legitimate formal goals, detectives develop close personal relationships with burglars-not unlike, in some respects, the relations of federal regulatory agents and those they regulate. Through these relationships, (which Thompson, 1967:35, describes as "contrac- ting," not "co-opting") the burglars help, in a sense, to make enforcement policy, through such decisions as who will be arrested and who will not. The burglar-informants are often made to feel that they are a part of the police department (Skolnick, 1966:130). The fact that the detectives overlook their minor misdeeds (Westley, 1970:39) does not constitute misuse of public authority for private gain, so the relationship itself cannot be termed corrupt. Sometimes such relationships can go further, with detectives "licensing" burglars to operate in certain territories without fear of arrest in exchange for cash payments (Steffens, 1931:222-223; Sutherland, 1937:117) or even helping burglars to plan burglaries in order to split the reward for recovery of the stolen goods (Laurie, 1970:214). Where such actions are in accordance with the operative goals of the social control agency (our criterion for distinguishing organizational and individual behavior), they</page><page sequence="7">484 SHERMAN constitute organizational corruption. The legitimate formal goal of arresting burglars may still be operative, but it takes second place to the illegitimate goal of profit through the sale of nonen- forcement. Similarly, when the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was founded in 1934 to develop and enforce corporate financial reporting standards, its principal goal was to help stabilize the economy by preventing stock price manipulation and ruinous speculation, and by providing investors with reliable information. The financial community in general, and the ac- counting profession in particular, was so opposed to the SEC that it threatened to go on "strike" by halting capital investment and refusing to file audits (Chatov, 1975). In order to appear to be ensuring that investors receive reliable information, the SEC gave up its public mandate to develop corporate financial reporting standards to the private sector. Moreover, the SEC has also depended on the accounting and financial sector for expertise, a dependence reflected in the an- cient principle that "it takes a thief to catch a thief." Just as the famous thief Eugene Francois Vidocq was hired in restoration France to establish the first centralized Criminal Investigation Division of the French Police and staff it with criminals (Stead, 1957:94), President Roosevelt and his successors have appointed corporate lawyers and accountants to both the staff and the Commissionerships of the SEC. Whether the "revolving door" of employment between the SEC and the private sector means that every SEC decision is made with a view to private gain is subject to debate, but there are those who would label such behavior as organizational corruption. That it is often the regulated who threaten the regulators is further supported by the history of other federal independent regulatory agencies. The standard assumption that the regulatory agencies were all created to control deviance in a recalcitrant industry may only be true for some of the agencies, such as the Interstate Commerce Commission (Chatov, 1975:97; but see Stone, 1975:107; and Skolnick, 1978:166). Many others were created with the active support of the in- dustries themselves in order to insure predictability and stable profits (Conklin, 1977:122). Both the Civil Aeronautics Board and the Federal Communications Commission, for example, have been described as having been "established by the regulated industries to operate a cartel in their behalf, and both have behaved according to the expectations of their creators, restricting entry and maintaining prices and industry profits" (Chatov, 1975:97). Similarly, some gangsters have been able to use local police departments to guarantee themselves a monopoly on the local vice and gambling industries. Dependent on gangsters such as "Wincanton's" Irv Stern (Gardiner, 1970:23) for campaign contributions necessary to get elected, Mayors and City Council members sometimes allow the gangsters to set law enforcement policy and to choose top police officials. The high police officials then misuse their public authority for their own personal gain (in payoffs from the gangsters), but lower level officers may be compelled to misuse their public authority for the personal gain of the elective officials and their police superiors, not themselves (Gardiner, 1970:25; Sherman, 1978:36). The elective of- ficials' dependence on campaign contributions leads them to co-opt the gangsters who then make corruption an operative organizational goal of the police department. MODEL II: CAPTURE BY EXTERNAL EXPLOITERS OF CONTROL A second pattern of social control corruption is capture: the exploitation of the agency's authority for the financial gain of outsiders who control significant resources of the agency. Unlike the co-optation of gambling organizations and airlines which use social control agencies as tools to restrict competition and to maintain price levels, politicians capture social control agen- cies to use them as marketable commodities. While some politicians may be so dependent on one source of campaign contributions (such as "Wincanton's" gangster boss, Irv Stern) that they are forced to co-opt that source, others may have a variety of sources of campaign funds interested in the policies and practices of the social control agencies under the control of elective officials.</page><page sequence="8">Organizational Corruption 485 Under those conditions, politicians need not co-opt anyone; they can sell control policy to the highest bidder, sometimes even on a case by case basis. The exploitation of control power for the financial gain of politicians is only possible when the politicians have "captured" the control agency (Thompson, 1967:30, 37). That is, it is only when the politicians-either elective officials or party leaders (or any other environmental actors con- trolling organizational resources, for that matter)-have such complete power to constrain almost any action by the social control agency that the captors can market those actions. Not all social control agencies are captives of their environments. Some of them, including all of those described below under Model III, have a good deal of autonomy and insulation from en- vironmental domination. Others may generally operate without interference, but they have the potential for capture whenever elective officials or others choose to interfere. Still others are directed on almost a day to day basis by elective and political party officials. The basic tool of capture is control over jobs, both how many there will be and who will fill them. Enforcement personnel comprise the vital resource of social control agencies, and the loyalties of the personnel selected can do much to shape the character of those organizations. Where this resource is largely under the control of the agency itself, capture seems to be very rare. Where it is under the control of another autonomous agency, such as a civil service commission, capture also seems rare. But where elective and party officials obtain direct control over person- nel, capture of the social control agency appears to be quite common. The classic case of selling the law enforcement decisions of a captive social control agency is the politically-dominated corrupt police department. As described by Royko (1972), Fogelson (1977) and Sherman (1978), these police departments vary somewhat in the precise form of their political domination, but in all of them some aspects of the personnel process are controlled by outsiders and are used to influence enforcement decisions. In the nineteenth century police departments Fogelson (1977) describes, the political machines determined every aspect of every police officer's career, from hiring to assignment and promotion. In Sherman's (1978:35) study of the contempo- rary "Central City" Police Department, however, only promotions and assignments (and not hir- ing) were found to be under political control; and his study of the Oakland Police Department of the early 1950s found only assignment to be subject to political influence. Nevertheless, in each of these cases, patrol officers were ordered by their superiors to ignore law violations at certain vice establishments that paid the politicians controlling the police departments for the privilege to operate without police interference.' While some police departments may be under the day to day direction of political figures for corrupt purposes, other social control agencies may only occasionally be captured for corrupt ex- ploitation. In the U.S. Justice Department, for example, few antitrust prosecution decisions seem to be influenced by attempts of the President or his party leaders to sell the decisions to the organizations they threaten. Yet during the antitrust prosecution of International Telephone and Telegraph for its acquisition of the Hartford Fire Insurance Company, former President Nixon did just that: he directly ordered the (presidentially appointed) Attorney General not to prosecute the case, and negotiated a sizable campaign contribution from I.T.T. at about the same time (New York Times, 1974). Similar campaign contributions to the Nixon administration in return for aid in the federal prosecution of the contributor occurred with the S.E.C. (Sale, 1977:248) 5. A question beyond the scope of this paper is the nature of the process by which organizations are cap- tured. In the case of urban police departments, however, the answer is very simple: they were created as cap- tive organizations by the white Anglo-Saxon Protestant political machines which first established them to control the newer immigrants (Levett, 1975). The more interesting question, perhaps, is the nature of the pro- cess by which police departments were successfully liberated from external capture (see Fogelson, 1977; Sher- man, 1978).</page><page sequence="9">486 SHERMAN and other regulatory agencies, although the evidence of direct capture of the decision-making process by the President is less clear in those cases. Even without blatant sale of particular decisions, of course, Presidents and their political aides can sell regulatory authority to regulated industries. When Nixon aide Herbert Kalmbach solicited corporate contributions for the 1972 campaign, he allegedly forced the corporations to give much more than they had planned by threatening to use the regulatory agencies against their interests (New York Times, 1973). Whether all such threats could have been implemented may be open to some question, given the civil service selection and tenure of regulatory agency employees (though not of the commissioners or board members); but judging by the Nixon administration's apparently successful capture of the National Transportation Safety Board-by installing what one career civil servant described as "the White House Mafia, the guys who were put in these agencies to get rid of people like me" (Berger, 1977:244)-the threats may well have been deliverable. If any of the enforcement decisions were influenced by the campaign contributions, then that behavior clearly constituted organizational corruption. MODEL III: DOMINATION BY INTERNAL EXPLOITERS OF CONTROL The political capture of social control agencies would not surprise the good-government reformers of the progressive era, whose solution to that problem was to insulate the agencies from political influence as much as possible. What would surprise them, however, is that even highly autonomous agencies of social control have adopted deviant goals and become organiza- tionally corrupt. The dominant administrative coalitions of these "sheltered" (Thompson, 1967:152) organizations6 have been taken over by organizational members who support the goal of personally profiting from the sale of law enforcement decisions. Where organizational members do not have to compete with outside captors, they may take advantage of the oppor- tunity to exploit the power of official control for their own personal gain. Certain police departments provide a classic example of this pattern. They also show how the autonomy necessary for this process of becoming corrupt need not be entirely formal or legal in nature. In New York City, for example, the historically corrupt police department has apparently been free from political capture for the sale of law enforcement decisions since Mayor O'Dwyer was almost indicted during a gambling payoff scandal in the early 1950s (Mockridge and Prall, 1954). The department went right on selling enforcement immunity for the gain of its own members, however, even after the political involvement ceased (Knapp, 1972). Even during the heyday of Tammany Hall, for that matter, the New York police were able to attain a fair amount of autonomy from political capture, apparently keeping the lion's share of the graft within the department (Steffens, 1931:248). The Cincinnati Police Department would surprise the progressives even more. Restructured ac- cording to their ideal plan to provide almost complete isolation from politics, that department provided for civil service selection and promotion up to and including the rank of chief. Even the City Manager cannot remove the police chief except for cause, a structure that has been strongly endorsed by the International Association of Chiefs of Police (1976). For years, Cincinnati was widely reputed in police circles to have one of the most honest police departments in the country (Reppetto, 1970), a fact attributed to its great autonomy. In 1975, however, nine police officers alleged that a police chief had been selling arrest immunity to a number of vice establishments and directing enforcement policy accordingly (New York Times, 1975); the chief was later con- victed on related criminal charges. The chief apparently imposed deviant operative goals on the 6. These organizations are, of course, still open to a variety of influences, but they are sheltered from direct external control of personnel promotions and assignments.</page><page sequence="10">Organizational Corruption 487 organization despite its apparent climate of integrity and (or perhaps because of) its great autonomy. The federal-level law enforcement agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Drug Enforcement Agency, have also experienced the same pattern of organizational corrup- tion. Renowned for the high "quality" and college education of their agents as well as their general freedom from political interference, federal police agencies are often thought of as being above corruption. Yet that is far from true. The federal Drug Enforcement Agency has had a continuing problem of organizational corruption since the 1930s (Epstein, 1977:104-105). Similar problems have been found in the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (New York Times, 1973). In one of the most extreme cases of organizational autonomy in federal law enforcement, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (which makes all its own personnel decisions internally) has recently lost its corruption-free image in a series of allegations from FBI agents (Crewdson, 1979; New York Times, 1979). Internal domination by exploiters of control is not confined to police agencies. Civil service building inspectors in New York City, working without any political control, developed an almost universal practice of extorting bribes for issuing certificates of occupancy (Shipler, 1972), for which the majority of the building inspectors working in Manhattan between 1972 and 1974 were indicted (Ranzal, 1974). Grain inspectors officially licensed by the U.S. Department of Agri- culture have developed a pattern of taking bribes to overlook violations (Robbins, 1975). Wherever organizations combine regulatory powers and a relatively sheltered system of organiza- tional control from within, the potential for this pattern of corruption seems to be present. PREDICTING THE MODELS These three models demonstrate that there are a variety of conditions under which social con- trol agencies adopt deviant operative goals and become organizationally corrupt. The brief illus- trative material presented here probably identifies only a few of the possible conditions, and cer- tainly fails to identify all of the necessary conditions of each model. As a first step towards ex- plaining organizational corruption in social control agencies, however, three hypotheses can be induced from the models: H,: The more social control agencies depend upon their subjects to accomplish their formal goals, the more likely it is that organizational corruption will arise, if at all, through co- optation of the subjects of control. H2: The more vulnerable social control agencies' personnel decisions are to external manipula- tion, the more likely it is that organizational corruption will arise, if at all, through ex- ternal capture of the agencies for the sale of enforcement decisions. H3: The more sheltered social control agencies are from dependence on outsiders, the more likely it is that organizational corruption will arise, if at all, through internal domination by sellers of enforcement decisions. None of these hypotheses can predict whether a social control agency will become organiza- tionally corrupt; they merely predict the model by which corruption would occur if it did arise. Indeed, hypotheses 2 and 3, if used to predict corruption, would lead to contradictory predic- tions: both an open system (H2) and a closed system (H3) will lead to organizational corruption. What is missing from both the hypotheses and the models is specification of the conditions under which threatened agencies do not corruptly co-opt their subjects of control, under which agencies with externally controlled personnel decisions are not captured by politicians, and under which highly autonomous agencies are not dominated by internal exploiters of regulatory authority. The concepts taken from the sociology of organizations help us understand why each of the</page><page sequence="11">488 SHERMAN models occur, but they do not explain why corruption does not occur when the conditions of each model are present. The additional conditions needed to predict whether a social control agency will become cor- rupt might be drawn from a variety of types of explanation of crime borrowed from the indi- vidual level of analysis: differences in deterrence (Gibbs, 1975), opportunities to commit crime (Wilkins, 1965), or perhaps even the strength of organizational bonds to conventional social norms (Hirschi, 1969). Alternatively, explanations of organizational goal setting stressing the po- litical economy of organizations (Zald, 1970) and organizational conflict (Pfeffer, 1978) might be applied, although this explanatory perspective is even further away from being a theory than are explanations of individual criminality (Perrow, 1972). Whatever direction theories of the organizational adoption of deviant operative goals may take, there would seem to be two priorities for theory construction. First, criminological concepts that apply only to the individuals must be separated from those appropriate for both levels of analysis. Sutherland once pointed out (in the unfair context of attempting to discredit psycho- analytic theory as an explanation of any crime) that it is unlikely that "the crimes of the Ford Motor Company are due to the Oedipus Complex, or those of the Aluminum Company of Amer- ica to an Inferiority Complex" (1949:257). Yet there are many concepts used to explain individual crime, from commitment to stigma, which may well be applicable at the organizational level as well. The second task for theory construction is to identify those concepts which are only ap- plicable at the organizational level of analysis. With more attention to such distinctively organiza- tional issues as control of resources, conflicts over goals and the formation of dominant coali- tions, as well as to the relevant explanations of individual crime, we may begin to understand the causes as well as the forms of organizational deviance.
