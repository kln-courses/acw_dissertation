In the course of this brief visit of about three hours many objects both of known and unknown provenance were photographed and measured. Among the monuments were a surprising number of unpub lished painted vault capstones, all of them of supposedly hitherto unknown place of origin and lacking any inventory numbers. There were about more than a dozen capstones, some in a rather good condition, others in a very fragmen tary state. Only one of the objects proved to be a published piece, namely an unprovenanced capstone erroneously attrib uted to the site of Tohcok, Campeche (Rocha Segura 2003). The presently known corpus of painted capstones from the Northern Maya Lowlands consists of somewhat more than 160 painted objects.The two-room Guadalupe bodega, con taining at least 13 examples, makes this the largest single collection existing of decorated capstones. Many capstones there portray images of anthropomorphic figures, some bear ing hieroglyphic texts, and two are without traces of painting on the surviving stucco coating. One of the better preserved examples, showing in red paint a seated figure and a glyphic band above the scene, was of particular interest and has been photographed with a color picture film (detail on front cover and Fig. 1). Unfortunately, the light conditions in the bodega were unfavourable and therefore the pictures obtained are not of the best quality. Concerning further data on the history and provenance of this capstone, Antonio Benavides Castillo (written com munications, May and June 2009) provided the information that the monument was definitely found at the Chenes site of Dzibilnocac and was, in an informal way, delivered to the INAH Centro Campeche by a student who worked at the site in 2004. There is no formal official register yet. In March of 2009 I photographed this capstone again, when it was on exhibit at the Museo de Arquitectura Maya, in the Baluarte de Nuestra Senora de la Soledad in Campeche City. Guido Krempel (written communications, June and July 2009) of the staff of mexicon recently photographed it in the museum and informed me that its place of origin is given on a large label as Santa Rosa Xtampak, doubtlessly an erroneous state ment. The wrong provenance probably results from an ear lier exhibit when an unnumbered capstone from Santa Rosa Xtampak, found in 2003 (Zapata 2007:1) was displayed here in 2007 and 2008. This capstone was removed and replaced with the "new" Dzibilnocac capstone in the same vitrine, but unfortunately the old label and description of the Santa Rosa Xtampak stone was left in place unchanged and this ultimately resulted in the present confusing provenance state ment. The provenance given by Benavides is accepted here and the monument is accordingly designated as Dzibilnocac Capstone 6; its abbreviation is "DBN:Cst.6". The large Maya archaeological site of Dzibilnocac was first visited by John Stephens and Frederick Catherwood in February 1842 (1963) and is located in the Municipalitiy of Hopelchén, Campeche, near and within the modern town of Vicente Guerrero, also known as Iturbide. Since the first painted Maya capstone was described and illustrated by John Stephens, the following works by Teobert Maler, Edward Thompson, Harry Pollock, John Bolles, Mar tine Fettweis-Viénot, Ramon Carrasco, Leticia Staines Cic ero, Leticia Vargas de la Pena, and many other investigators, the published corpus of painted capstones has been growing continuously and enormously. Stephens (1963) found four examples, Teobert Maler (1997) discovered and reported a series of examples, Sylvanus Morley (1948) registered 15 items and Christopher Jones (1975) published a list of 34 painted and carved capstones. Eight years later I catalogued a total of 103 decorated capstones from the Northern Maya ^^06^ &gt;3 ' ■ Wt'-. - Fig. 1. Dzibilnocac Capstone 6 (photograph by Karl Herbert Mayer, 2006).

Later Graham adopted my recommended no menclature and terminology and several painted capstones at Uxmal were given the site's abbreviation, the capstone abbreviation, and numbers (Graham 1992:81; Graham and Von Euw 1992:139-144; Mayer 1995). Dzibilnocac Capstone 6 This hitherto unpublished capstone is 43 cm high, 38 cm wide, and 13 cm thick. The incomplete and roughly rectangular limestone block is finished with white or yellowish stucco, of which some small portions have flaked off. Upon this stucco cover is a painted portrayal of a seated anthropomorphic fig ure with an elongated bundle on his front.

Nikolai Grube (written Santa Rosa Xtampak (Zapata 2007) and Macoba (Mayer communication, July 2009) kindly provided the following 2002, 2004: 5) and from the Puuc Zone sites of Acanmul comments: "The first glyph certainly is a day sign with a coef (Staines Cicero 2002), Yaxche-Xlabpak (Benavides 2006), and Chunchimay 2 (Benavides and Novelo, in press). Two unprovenanced examples were also published in the recent past (Uriarte 1998: Cat. No. 29; Staines Cicero 2001: PI. 2b, Nos. 20,21). Painted capstones are a peculiar artistic and architec tural feature incorporated in vaults of ancient Maya masonry buildings. Usually it is the centrally placed stone in a row of horizontally laid capstones which is decorated. Such mural manifestations occur frequently in the Puuc and Chenes Zones of the Central Yucatan Peninsula region, but there are also others found in the Northern Plains Zone, the Campeche Zone and the Rio Bee Zone. Outside these regions are excep tional finds at Bonampak, Chiapas, Tikal, Guatemala, and Caracol, Belize. Chronologically, most of the painted capstones are dated to the Late Classic and Terminal Classic periods, and the Chichen Itza examples may date to later temporal phases. A few capstones have inscriptions that bear rather secure ca lendridal dates (Garcfa-Campillo 1998: 300; Grana-Behrens 2002a, 2002b). Concerning the nomenclature of decorated capstones I have devised and employed a system for an easy and definite designation, giving an abbreviation with a three-letter code for capstones, "Cst.", and numbering them consequently (Mayer 1983). When Ian Graham (1975) designed his project of a "Corpus of Maya Hieroglyphic Inscriptions", he did not treat the capstones as a specific class of texts and did not give them a proper designation. Therefore, the first painted and inscribed capstone in the project was denoted as "Pixoy, Miscellaneous 1" with its abbreviation "PIX:Msc. 1" (Von hi8- 3- Dzibilnocac Capstone 1 (drawing by Christian Prager). yg mexicon • Vol. XXXI • August 2009 Fig. 2.

This deity is decorated with an elaborate, beaded expression of a tamale/tortilla food offering (Grana-Behrens feather headdress, a feather wing, ajade collar, andalargeear 2002a: 127-131, 423, 460, PI. 54).

Both glyphic elements can be read as OHL/WAH-wa, or as a full form of the logograph WAH, meaning wah, tamale, and in an extended sense also "food, nourishment". K'awiil portrayals are a prominent and frequent motif on painted capstones (Mayer 1983; Arellano Hernandez 1996, 2001; Staines Cicero 2001: 396-399; 2004). The association of this deity with a sack of grains appears very frequently. The overwhelming majority of the sacks contain obviously maize kernels and in some cases cacao beans (Stuart 2005: 187). Chronologically, the date inscribed on the capstone can not be deciphered and presently the monument can be vaguely ascribed to the Terminal Classic, perhaps to 840 - 950 AD. Stylistically, the iconography of this capstone differs from the capstones so far reported from Dzibilnocac. In the follow ing the hitherto published five monochrome examples from this Chenes Zone site are briefly described and illustrated in order to facilitate epigraphical and iconographical compari sons and further studies.

In 19811 documented it in a storeroom of the Rautenstrauch-Joest Museum in Cologne. This unprov enanced example depicts a seated human figure, possibly K'awiil, associated with a bundle, enclosed on top and bot tom by horizontal glyphic bands, and showing additional two glyph blocks, one representing a WAH sign. According to a written communication provided in 1981 by the then curator of the museum, this unprovenanced capstone came from the same private collection as Dzibilnocac Capstone 1.
