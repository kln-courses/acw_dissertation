<plain_text><page sequence="1">An Early Example of Atenist Iconoclasm Henry G. Fischer The iconoclastic deletions of the Atenists were not confined to the name and figure of Amenre, but were apt to eliminate almost any detail that might be associated with that god - a pet goose, for example, or the leopard-skin of the sVw-priest.1 It is therefore understandable that, in the scene illustrated here (pl. XXXIX), from the Luxor temple of Amenophis III,2 such erasures have been applied not only to the inscriptions (subsequently restored) but also to the group of lettuce plants which, along with the ithyphallic representation of Amun, was borrowed from the iconography of the god Min. Since the lettuce plants were emblematic of Min's fecundity, this erasure doubtless explains why the erasure of Amun's figure is confined to the phallus. I believe that this scene provides an explanation for a curious series of mutilations in the reliefs of the Karnak shrine of Sesostris I. Although there is no indication of it in the publication of Lacau and Chevrier, the ithyphallic representations of Amun have been regularly, although less completely, attacked in the same manner. The number of examples is such as to leave no doubt that the mutila- tion is intentional, particularly since the surface of the reliefs is otherwise so remarkably well pre- served. And lest there be any suspicion that they are the result of recent vandalism, it may be noted that they are apparent on photographs that show the dismantled blocks prior to their reconstruction (Fig. 2).3 Since the shrine was dismantled and placed in the foundations of the third pylon at Karnak in the reign of Amenophis III, this mutilation would seem to be an early instance of Atenist iconoclasm, for it is difficult to find a motive for it at any other date within the 550 years that intervened between the shrine's construction and its dismantling. Such a conclusion, if correct, reinforces the generally accepted interpretation of two offering scenes on the east face of the Third Pylon, which show Amenophis III followed by the half-effaced smaller figure of a king wearing the blue crown.4 This figure can hardly be anyone but Amenophis IV, who was therefore coregent before the pylon was completed. The new evidence suggests, more- over, that the coregency was in effect during the early stages of the pylon's construction and hence was a matter of years rather than months.5 It admittedly seems curious that the Atenists had already begun attacking the image of Amun, if only surreptitiously, even as the young coregent continued to join his father in celebrating Amun's cult.6 And the mutilation of so specific an aspect of the god is quite different, of course, from the later erasures, which always eliminated his name and often expunged his figure in its entirety. Finally, at the risk of excessive speculation, one might consider whether the mutilation of the ithyphallic representations of Amun has some connection with the peculiarly assexual colossus of Amenophis IV7 and with his emphasis on the sun, rather than the semen of an anthropomorphic god, as the generative force of nature.8 1 Nina Davies and A.

The detail printed in fig. 4a is also illustrated by Cyril Aldred, Akhenaten and Nefertiti (New York, 1973), fig. 4 on p. 19, showing more of the context. Cf. also Porter-Moss, Topographical Bibliography II, 2nd ed., p. 61 (183). 6 Thus supporting, at least to some degree, Aldred's argument for a long coregency as presented in his Akhenaten (London, 1968), pp. 100-16. 6 The other evidence for the persecution of Amun does not offer very clear evidence for the date when this persecution began; Aldred has suggested that it began much later in Akhenaten's reign (o.c, 245-246). 7 Discussed ibid., pp. 133-134, and illustrated on pl. 2. 8 Cyril Aldred, who has kindly read the first draft of this note, and has offered some valuable comments, agrees in the main with my conclusions but points out that erasures in the foundations do not necessarily confirm his own views on a long coregency. And he doubts that the erasure of the phallus in any way reflects a peculiarly Atenist view of creation since onanistic implications are fundamental to the cult of Re, and since the Atenists were not sufficiently innovative as to modify so essential an aspect of that cult. The phallus being the prime attribute of Atum, "it may be that the Atenist erasures were made be- cause they denied this function to any other god."</page><page sequence="3">HENRY G. FISCHER!
