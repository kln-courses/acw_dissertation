Pp. 259 of text plus 213 pp. of line drawings illustrating the Catalogue of deco rated stones and a further 39 distribution maps, graphs and tables incorporated in the Discussion section of the text and (at end) 41 half-tone plates. The Clarendon Press. Oxford University Press, 1981. ?50. This finely produced volume is a credit both to the author and her publishers. Her coverage of the subject reaches a high level of completeness. A brief introduction, which explains the reason for its compilation as a background against which the abundant new discoveries made during the recent excavations at New Grange and Knowth can be studied, is followed by a discussion section concerned with the regional groupings in Iberia, France (mostly Brittany) and the British Isles. One fact is abundantly clear: megalithic art in practice means passage-grave art. Only in France is there more than a handful of instances to be found in gallery graves; in some cases, as at Sess Kilgreen, Co. Tyrone (fig. 209, standing-stone) there is reason to suspect that the single standing stone is the sole surviving remnant of a passage grave. Some of the line drawings in the catalogue are based on earlier published drawings by others but the majority have been done by a direct tracing technique in the field from the original examples. In some ofithe French art, tracings have been made in museums from plaster casts of the originals. Tracing involved the use of cellophane or stouter transparent plastic sheet which was attached to the decorated stone by masking tape. The actual tracing was done with felt-tipped pens, using pens of different colours to differentiate between natu ral and artificial features. 'Two techniques were used in producing the final drawings. The cel lophane tracings for Ireland and about half those for France were re-drawn full size on to tracing paper and were then reproduced photographically to a smaller scale (either 1:5 or 1:10). The remain der of the drawings were produced by first reduc ing the cellophane tracings photographically and then making the final drawings at a scale of 1:5. In the second method the elimination of the process of drawing from the cellophane tracings at full size saved a considerable amount of time and trouble.' The resulting illustrations have the ring of truth about them. To pronounce definitely one would need to take the book to the megaliths and com pare line by line with the originals. The next best thing to this counsel of perfection is to compare the line drawings with the photographs in the book. In the case of Gavrinis and Les Pierres Plates the reviewer has been able to compare the drawings with his own photographs. The results are reassuring. The author has struck a happy balance between the two extremes of over tidyness and exaggerated irregularities. Most passage-grave art is at first sight purely geometrical. Mrs Shee-Twohig, like her predeces sors the Abb6 Breuil and Stuart Piggott, has adopted an analytical approach to the subject which begins with the identification of individual motifs, in fact what might almost be called 'art units', which in this book form the basis of tables and histograms in the discussion section. Such an approach seems inevitable but does not allow for the larger 'compositions', some of which can clearly be recognised as anthropomorphic. Some of these smaller units are obviously representa tional not of humans but of inanimate objects; the Breton hafted stone axe is a good example of this. Writers on megalithic art have for long regarded various pairs of concentric circles and of tightly wound helices (i.e. spirals) as stylised human eyes or breasts. The eye interpretation finds favour where the pair of circles or helices has a lozenge set between them to represent a nose. If pairs of circles or helices can be interpreted thus, what of the triplicated examples, like the Clear Island stone? Or what, indeed, of the single tight helices or the single concentric circles? The most significant of the diagrams in the dis cussion section is fig. 13 which shows the occurr ence of each symbol in each of the three main provinces of the art. Five of these symbols are shared by all three art regions. The commonest of the five overall is the serpentiform or 'snake pat tern'. This is almost ludicrous when one considers the total absence of snakes in Ireland! This is perhaps a reminder that the obvious interpreta tion of a symbol is not always the right one. In view of what has been written by earlier scholars such as Breuil and 0. G. S. Crawford in interpreting the face and/or breasts as evidence for a Mother Goddess or Earth Mother cult, it is well to record that Dr Shee-Twohig sounds a note of caution. While she admits this as a possibility in the case of the French statue-menhirs, she reminds the reader that s6me of these are 210</page><page sequence="2">obviously of the male rather than the female sex. The most that she will concede is a verdict of 'not proven'. The only instances of truly realistic living creatures which she can point to are Iberian exam ples of hunters, deer, dogs and horses, as at Jun cais, Cubillejo de Lara de los Infantes and prob ably at Montefrio, Granada. In both style and subject matter these examples are very reminis cent of the south-east Spanish rock-shelter art. A final point: one certainty in this world of uncertainties is the prohibitive cost of the volume under review. Purchases at ?50 a time will be almost confined to institutional libraries. I hate to think what the cost of its successor(s) on the New Grange and Knowth art will be in these inflationary times. A. E. P. COLLINS</page></plain_text>
