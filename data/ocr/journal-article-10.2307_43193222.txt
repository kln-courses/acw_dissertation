<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Deer Goddess of Ancient Siberia. A Study in the Ecology of Belief. By ESTHER JACOBSON. Studies in the History of Religions, Numens Bookseries, Vol. 55. Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1993. 291 pp., ISBN 90-04-09628-0. The Deer Goddess in Ancient Siberia is an impressive undertaking, one of the few books in the English language on this topic, on the iconography of the deer image in the art of South Siberia and Mongolia from the Neolithic to the early Iron Age. The author deals with the image of the deer as it appears on the monolithic stelae found in this region, as well at archaeological sites. Jacobson attempts to construct a symbolic system in which the deer image is at the center with its many transformations and permutations. From mythic traditions to metalwork, this study is an intricate attempt to unravel the intertwining of cultures and concepts. Chapter one, "The Reconstruction of Symbolic Systems," and two, "The Image of the Deer: Theoretical Constructs," serves as introductions. Chapter three, "Images and the Symbolizing Order of Images in the Art of the Early Nomads," treats the rich finds at such burial sites as Arzhan, Tuekta, Pazyryk, Berel, Bashadar, Katanda, Ulandryk, Tashanta, Aluchaideng, Issyk and others. Chapters four, "Rock Carvings and Paintings from the Neolithic and Aeneolithic Periods," five, "The Elaboration of Image and Meaning: The Petroglyphic Tradition of the Middle and Late Bronze Age," and six, "Deer</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 119 Stones and Warriors: Anthropomorphic Monoliths of the First Millennium B.C./' are detailed treatments and analyses of the subject matter of petroglyphs and monoliths. Chapter seven, "In Search of the Animal Mother: Pre-Shamanic, Shamanic and Mythic Traditions/' ventures into the land of interpretation. Shamanic and mythic traditions of a selection of Siberian peoples are discussed, with the author stating clearly that the leap from archaeology to ethnography is fraught with great difficulties and one must remain cautious. This reviewer is left wondering why certain traditions were chosen and not others; you be the judge. Chapter eight, "Absence and Presence: The Deer Goddess of Ancient Siberia," in conclusion, attempts to piece together the broken archaeological record with the images and symbolic systems available to the author in ethnography. Whether or not the reader will agree with the selections made, it remains clear that this is a significant advance in a much neglected field of study, and this book makes available to the public for the first time a great inventory of material to ponder. The book contains twenty-one pages of highly detailed plates. The bibliography unites many valuable sources for further study of this often neglected topic; however, sadly ignored is the wealth of Mongolian language materials. For example, on pp. 142-148, Jacobson specifically discusses the deer stones of Mongolia, citing the works of well-known Russian scholars V. V. Volkov, A. P. Okladnikov, N. N. Dikov, E. A. Novgorodova and others, but ignoring the works of N. Ser-Odkav, D. Maidar, D. Tseveendorj, X. Perlee, D. Dork, Ts. Gocoo and Ts. Dorksiiren, B. Bayar, D. Navaan, Ts. Gagdars√ºren and B. Dogsam, many of whom have even published in Russian, in addition to their native Mongolian. Mongol archaeologists had, after all, accompanied the Soviet expeditions to Mongol archaeological sites since the 1950s, as well as having led their own expeditions in their own land. There was, in fact, a joint Mongol-Soviet Historical Cultural Expedition established in 1967 to carry out just such endeavors. To overlook their many publications seems to suggest that Mongol archaeologists have nothing to contribute, when the otherwise impressive and extensive bibliography of the book at hand cites many works not specifically treating the target region. With not a single work in the Mongolian language used, or at the very least, one written by a Mongol in</page><page sequence="3">120 Mongolian Studies, 1995 Russian, there is a great sin of omission, for Mongol scholars have contributed much to the field and were never mere students of the Russians. A Mongolist will wonder why Jacobson sees fit to consult Russian and Chinese scholars, Herodotus, Ssu-ma Ch'ien, an Avestan Hymn to Mithra, and the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh, and not a Mongol writer or archaeologist. The text contains an abundance of transliteration errors; for example, the Tien-shan mountain range is repeatedly rendered as Tyan-Shan in the Cyrillic fashion. Many Chinese terms were taken directly from the Russian and not transferred into one of the standard Wade-Giles or Pinyin systems used in English-language scholarship; incorrect transliterations of Mongol words are also given unnecessarily via the Russians. The overwhelming dependency upon Russian sources does not take away from the value of this new study; it is an important work, and indeed ground-breaking. Carolyn Shields Lysandrou</page></plain_text>
