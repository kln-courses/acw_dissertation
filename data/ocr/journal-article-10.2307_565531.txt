<plain_text><page sequence="1">M. J. Daunton's, Coal Metropolis: Cardiff I870-I9I4 (Leicester: Univer- sity Press, I977. CI2) is the best monograph on urban history to appear in recent years. The author writes well, but the character of Cardiff that is built up through the book is not gained by quack grandiloquence - anthropomorphic incantations designed to summon the 'spirit of Cardiff' - but by the exercise of the historian's professional skills. Dr Daunton possesses a clear, searching, and patient intelligence: he is not ready to accept the conclusions of other urban historians or to jump to con- clusions of his own until he has tested a variety of hypotheses against the evidence. The result is that most of the chapters in this book will interest other historians of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and induce not a few to think again. There are valuable thoughts here about economic growth, the failure to diversify the economy of Cardiff, indeed of South Wales, and to establish a mature manufacturing sector; about the social structure and economic trends in the coal and tramp-shipping trades; about landownership, house-building and house-buying, and a town's physical growth; about Council membership and politics; about the rupture in Liberal-Labour relations; and about urban perceptions. The success of this book provokes some reflections about what are the prerequisites of good urban history. Part of the answer lies in the subject itself. Cardiff is almost a model choice. Growing from 82,76I in i88i to I82,259 in i9II, and established in that period as the country's leading coal emporium and as South Wales' capital, Cardiff is sufficiently sizeable and significant to demand that historians pay attention to the features of its development; but Cardiff's misfortunes - particularly the narrowness and concentration of its business and landownership - reduce it as a subject to proportions sufficient to be encompassed by one acute and determined student.
