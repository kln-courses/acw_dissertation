<plain_text><page sequence="1">A PREHISTORIC FIGURINE FROM MYCENAE (PLATE 19) INTRODUCTION THE following article by Mr. Steven Diamant of the American School of Classical Studies con- cerns a stone figurine that came to light in 1962 in the House with the Idols' or, as the site was called in 1962, the Citadel House. Mr. Diamant did not take part in the 1962 excavations, so some mention of the context of the find is necessary. It was found in the south-east corner of the 'Citadel House' in a basement room, designated Room II, which lies just to the east of the temple complex uncovered in 1969,2 in other words, in between the cult areas of the House with the Idols (Citadel House) and the ramps that lead up to the shrine in Tsountas's House. As Professor Mylonas has shown3 the whole of this part of the Acropolis was a sacred area, though I do not think that the figurine need necessarily have any religious connotation. The figurine was found in the beaten floor of Room II which lay over a red stratum contain- ing MH sherds. However, the latest context of the find is LH IIIB. W. D. TAYLOUR During the 1962 season at Mycenae a very small pendant in the form of a figurine was re- covered from the House with the Idols (Citadel House) (see FIG. I, PLATE 19). It is here published as a separate entity both for its obvious aesthetic value, and as something of a test case. Clearly the most important work on prehistoric figurines of the Aegean and Near East in recent years is that of P. Ucko.4 It establishes, among other things, a simple and con- sistent system of description. On that basis a number of conclusions are reached which deviate markedly from standard assumptions previously used.s Thus far there has been surprisingly little reaction to Ucko's work, at least in the Aegean sphere. As a beginning, the figurine under consideration will be described according to the categories in Ucko's catalogue of Egyptian and Cretan figurines. For convenience these will be reiterated here with minor changes:6 A. Material used for manufacture; techniques; measurements in cm.; B. Arm positions and techniques for showing arms; incision or separate modelling; C. Position and shape of head; details and description of facial features; D. Description of breasts or penis (sheath); E. Posture; position of legs and techniques for showing legs; incision or separate modelling; F. Description of buttock protrusion (assessed with allowance for total dimensions of figure) and technique for showing buttocks; incision or separate modelling; G. Detail of ornamentation and technique for ornamentation; H. Anatomical details and techniques for showing anatomical details. Acknowledgements. To Lord William Taylour my first thanks are due for his generosity and kindness both in allowing me to publish the pendent figurine and in the attendant details of study and writing. Eugene Vanderpool Jr. took and developed the photographs. Karen Vitelli made the drawings. Both she and Jeremy Rutter commented on various drafts of the paper.

Those delineating thighs from trunk are cylindrical in section and relatively shallow. The groove which marks the right thigh is almost closed off at the lower end where it meets the top of the vertical leg groove. The groove which marks the left thigh is slightly deeper and does not taper at the junction below the top of the vertical leg groove. The front leg groove has a V-shaped section and is relatively deep. Back leg groove also has a V-shaped section but is shallower. No sex marking. The feature most obvious from the drawings and photographs is the figurine's design as a pendant. About where the navel would be in a whole figure is a horizontal perforation, of oval shape, which was drilled from both ends. It is clear that the figurine was never intended to be whole, but only the lower half of an anthropomorphic figure. The view from above shows clearly how it was cut and shaped from 7 All colour references are to the Munsell Soil Color Charts (Baltimore, 1954).</page><page sequence="3">A PREHISTORIC FIGURINE FROM MYCENAE 105 a simple pebble of steatite (PLATE 19 d). Intentional 'half figures' have been recovered at the Franchthi Cave recently.8 Since the 1969 season at least two similar examples have been found. It is interesting that almost all the Franchthi examples have a horizontal ledge on the back, vertically pierced for suspension. Thus they also may be characterized as pendants. The posture of the figurine is clearly that of a seated figure. One of the views in FIG. I shows clearly the ease with which it will now sit on the edge of a flat right-angle surface. The closest parallel to the Mycenae figurine is, of course, the pendent figurine from Malthi.9 It also is made of steatite or talc. The modelling of the lower body is remarkably similar to that of the Mycenae one: wide hips, oblique grooves which differentiate the thighs from the trunk, legs flexed 90 degrees at the knees, lower legs which are separate only at the bottom, buttocks separated by a simple vertical groove. The thighs are somewhat more clearly modelled on the Malthi figure. The oblique grooves are also part of a horizontal ridge which seems to indicate rolls of stomach flesh. There is a hole drilled horizontally through the back at the narrowest point of the waist contraction, presumably for suspension purposes. A fairly close parallel to the Malthi pendant is one bought by A. J. B. Wace, said to be from Melos.IO The treatment of the waist, suspension-hole, stomach fold, and buttocks is quite similar, but the lower legs do not seem to dangle perpendicular to the body as in the Mycenae and Malthi examples. The Wace figurine also is clearly intended to be seated. A more distant parallel might be drawn with the prehistoric figurine found near Gortyna, cited by Valmin.II Ucko notes, however, that this figurine is standing, not seated.I2 No other close parallels are presently known to the writer. DISCUSSION The above description raises a number of problems. First, can this figurine be described as steatopygous? The conclusion to which Ucko came on the evidence of his corpus was that the criterion of steatopygy is difficult to define and virtually meaningless.'3 The certainty with which we can say that the Mycenae figure is seated dictates that the answer to the above ques- tion is a simple 'no'. The buttock protrusion is not out of proportion to a seated figure. The same may be said not only of the Malthi pendant, but of a number of other figurines from Greece: one from Eleusis,I4 two from Aegina,"s two from Sparta,16 and Wace's one, whatever its provenience. On the analogy of the Mycenae figurine, all these are probably to be thought of as seated, a posture which would be more logically explain their generously proportioned buttocks than steatopygy.I7 The sex of the Mycenae figurine is not marked in any way. One assumes, perhaps too easily, that it is female because most early figurines with similar proportions which are marked are female. Definite evidence in this case is lacking. Another of Ucko's contentions is that the interpretation of generously endowed figurines as 'Mother Goddesses' is one that is supported neither by ancient contexts nor by modern ethno- graphic parallels. Only in the Near East do we have good historical evidence for Mother God- desses.'s The Malthi pendant is a good case in point. The structure in which it was found, room B64, is designated by Valmin as a sanctuary.'9 The only reason which can be suggested 8 T. Jacobsen, Hesperia xxxviii (1969) 371 pl. 99a, bottom row. 9 N.

Likewise there is no specific evidence of a ritual context for the Mycenae pendant. More substantial evidence against its being identified as a deity is its design: i.e. as a pendant. It is significant that both the Malthi and the Wace figurine were also intended for suspension. Although a probable talismanic or amuletic function has been suggested for the Franchthi half-figurines, there is no solid evidence as yet to back such a contention.2z The presence of sus- pension holes, on the other hand, argues for an ornamental or utilitarian function. Thus this group of figurines (Mycenae, Malthi, Franchthi, Wace's) offers a small measure of support for Ucko's hypothesis. A final problem is the dating of the figurine. There is no question about the Neolithic dating of the Franchthi examples. But both the Mycenae and Malthi pendants come from Bronze Age contexts. The stratum from which the latter figure came 'contained one black Minyan and five small Early Helladic sherds'.2 When it was believed that the site of Malthi had phases of Neolithic occupation, there was some small justification for ignoring the pendant's context and dating it to the Neolithic period. Recently the work of McDonald and his associates in Messenia has cast doubt on this belief. They have found through surface survey and excava- tion of a later Bronze Age sequence at Nichoria that Valmin's so-called Adriatic Ware is chronologically confined to a particular phase of the Middle Helladic period.2z More recently R. Howell has restudied the Malthi pottery and now believes that the earliest ceramic evidence for occupation is a later phase of the Middle Helladic period.23 At Mycenae, the pendant was found in a LH IIIB context which immediately overlay a stratum with Middle Helladic sherds. On this evidence alone the Mycenae pendant should be dated to the Middle Helladic period since not only does it come from a stratum immediately on top of a Middle Helladic one, but its one close parallel comes from a site at which the later Middle Helladic period is the earliest (and principal) phase of occupation. When we look for help in dating to other even vaguely similar, generously proportioned figurines from mainland Greece, we find none forthcoming. The examples from the Athenian Agora,24 the Acropolis,25 Eleusis, Sparta, Aegina, with Wace's figurine, are all unstratified and without context. The figurine from Gortyna seems to have been a surface find near the site. One's immediate inclination is to call all these figurines 'Neolithic', but in fact there is no sound stratigraphic evidence whatsoever for such a dating. In the case of the Mycenae figure there is some evidence for Neolithic occupation of the site, particularly in the phase characterized by Neolithic Urfirnis pottery.26 Thus it might be possible to explain such a finely executed work of art in a Bronze Age context as an heirloom from the Neolithic period. But J. Caskey's more cautious contention-that such figurines were produced 'in many regions and over long periods of time, but not necessarily in the same periods in all places'z7-is still the most accurate statement possible. CONCLUSIONS The pendent half-figurine from Mycenae might possibly be a Neolithic heirloom found in a Bronze Age context in the House with the Idols. But on present evidence it can only safely be dated to the prehistoric period in general. It is clearly intended to be seated and for that reason is not to be thought of as steatopygous. Its suspension-hole probably indicates that it was 20 T. Jacobsen, op. cit. 371. 21 N. Valmin, op. cit. 339. 22 W. McDonald and G.

Nothing in its find context suggests any kind of ritual usage. It so closely resembles the pendent figurine from Malthi that the two might be considered as deriving from the same 'tradition'. Finally, it is hoped that this brief attempt to consider an early Greek figurine in a somewhat different light will encourage further attempts to describe figurines systematically and discuss alternative interpretations.
