<plain_text><page sequence="1">of enemies and pets: warfare and shamanism in Amazonia CARLOS FAUSTO-Museu Nacional, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro translated by David Rodgers-University of Manchester Since the beginning of lowland South American colonization, indigenous warfare has stirred European imagination. When the Portuguese arrived in Brazil in the 16th century, they encountered a huge population of Tupi-Guarani speaking people dispersed along some 5,000 kilometers of the Atlantic coast and deeply settled in the hinterland (Fausto 1992). Notwith- standing their dispersal, they shared a common social and cultural complex, at the very core of which were vengeance warfare and ritual cannibalism (Carneiro da Cunha and Viveiros de Castro 1985; Fernandes 1970). The centrality of these practices in indigenous social life, witnessed by Europeans of different origins and outlooks, has been a dominant motif in Western reflection upon Amerindian societies ever since.' In recent years, warfare in Amazonia has been the focus of harsh debates, opposing eco-functionalist (Harris 1979, 1984), sociobiological (Chagnon 1988), structuralist (Lizot 1977, 1994), and, more recently, neo-historicist approaches (Ferguson 1990). From different theoreti- cal frameworks and starting points, each of these approaches struggled to make sense of the phenomenon of war in lowland South America. While the debate had the positive effect of stimulating new research, the results have not been outstanding, especially when addressing "why" questions. At present, a neo-historicist approach challenges previous ones, but at the risk of effacing the very object of study, since from this perspective, warfare in egalitarian Amazonian societies is but the result of the encroachment of expanding states (Ferguson and Whitehead 1992). Warfare is thus transformed from a feature of native culture into an exogenous virus, disembarked from conquerors' ships together with metal instruments (Ferguson 1995). In the absence of any natural scarce resource to explain the bloody endeavor of war, anthropologists evoke Western commodities to fulfill this role. But then, what is one to make of the flourishing war rituals observed since the 16th century? How is one to understand the whole symbolic of cannibal predation that numerous ethnologists have reported as pervading native social life? In this article, I address these questions and propose a model of social reproduction in the indigenous South American lowlands which articulates shamanism and warfare within a generalized economy (Almeida 1988:221-222), inflected toward the production of persons and Indigenous warfare in tropical South America, frequently involving cannibalism and trophy hunting, has been a recurrent theme in Americanist literature. Since the 16th century, conquerors, missionaries, chroniclers, and more recently anthropolo- gists have striven to make sense of the phenomenon. In this article, I propose a model of social reproduction that subsumes warfare and shamanism within a generalized economy. I show the existence of a dialectic operating between two relational forms, predation and familiarization. This dialectic functions as a general schema of the mode for producing persons and groups in the region.

The ethnographic examples in this article come primarily from groups depicted in the literature as very warlike. Some of the data refer to cultural practices that are no longer observable, such as headhunting and cannibalism, although they were witnessed either by those who wrote about them or by native informants. The subjection of indigenous peoples to state administration, their incorporation into a commodity economy, and the disappearance of warfare may raise doubts about the validity of my model as a description of contemporary indigenous Amazonia. In this article, however, I am only concerned with long-standing symbolic forms that still impregnate indigenous practices and representations. The ways they have changed, are changing, and will change are not considered here (see Albert 1993; Fausto 1997:344-346; Turner 1993; Vilaca 1996). My focus is on warfare as a moment in the process of social reproduction. Most of what I have to say is about war symbolism, particularly with regard to its connection with shamanism. In this sense, my thesis may apply equally well to Amazonian peoples who have been described as peaceful, such as the Piaroa (Overing 1986, 1989). My argument, however, would require a more careful consideration in other cases, such as that of the Upper Xingu (Gregor 1990; see also Basso 1995; Heckenberger 1996). In order to make my argument clear, I begin with four propositions well established in the regional ethnography that are clearly relevant across a broad range of South American lowland societies. The first derives from the general notion of "gift economy" as opposed to "commodity economy" (see Gregory 1982; Strathern 1988). Amazonian societies are primarily oriented toward the production of persons, not material goods; that is, their focus is not the fabrication of objects through labor, but of persons through ritual and symbolic work. Birth and mortuary rites, initiations and naming ceremonies, shamanic and warfare festivals, seclusions and displays are all means for producing persons, for conferring on them singularity, beauty, fertility, agency, and the capacity to interact with external entities, like spirits, deities, animals, and enemies (Erikson 1996; Santos Granero 1986; Seeger et al. 1979; Turner 1995). This last capacity is crucial-and here is the second proposition-since in many native cosmologies the inside and identity are equated with a lack of fertility and movement in such a way that the overall reproduction of society is symbolically dependent on relations with the outside and otherness (Overing 1981:163-164; Viveiros de Castro 1992:283-284). My third remark con- cerns the limited involvement of wealth and prestige goods in producing social relationships in Amazonia (Riviere 1985). In so far as things rarely have any transcontextual value as substitutes for persons or relations, the mediation between "us" and "others" is done by persons, parts of persons, and non-material subjective qualities such as names, souls, and songs. Finally, some authors have proposed that the primary mode of interaction with the outside, with the alterity necessary for social reproduction, is not peaceful exchange, but predation (Clastres 1977; Overing 1993:196-199; Viveiros de Castro 1993:184-192). Taking these propositions as the analytical point of departure, I intend to address the following questions: (1) What is the place of warfare in Amazonian symbolic economies? (2) How does it articulate with other processes related to the production of persons? (3) How is it actually schematized? In responding to these questions, I defer analysis of my ethnographic material, the result of field research among the Parakana, a Tupi speaking people of southeastern Amazonia, and open with a critical reflection on two points usually taken for granted in structuralist approaches. First, I ask whether one of the difficulties in the conceptualization of the phenomenon of war in Amazonia has been brought about by its reduction to the discourse of exchange, in particular to one of its forms, symmetrical exchange. Second, I consider whether the emphasis on affinity as a schema of articulation between exterior and interior has detracted attention from other relationships and idioms, equally important in the articulation between local and global, inside and outside, in the South American lowlands. 934 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="3">revenge and reciprocity: a critical approach One of the most recurrent problems in Amazonian ethnology is the definition of the social units relevant to sociological analysis. In areas where there has not been a complete rupture of wider networks as a consequence of the long process of contact, conquest, and colonization, there are relatively open social systems with loosely defined ethnic boundaries. These systems are formed by a multiplicity of local groups that are very often unstable and fluid. Defining ethnographic domains under these conditions implies the necessity of distinguishing between different levels of inclusion: the local group, a network of allied groups, a complex of groups (allied or not) speaking the same language, and so on. The definition of any such social constellation demands that one account for the relations that structure it. In some supralocal systems, such as the Upper Xingu and the Upper Rio Negro, peaceful exchanges (matrimonial, ritual, and economic-ceremonial) articulate wider webs of sociality, as well as individual groups. In other cases, hostile relations fulfill this role. Warfare practices, frequently involving cannibalism and trophy hunting, emerge as mechanisms in the structuration of certain social constellations. A theoretical problem arises from these cases: how can social systems be structured by a mode of relation that appears to be the very negation of social relationship? Replying to this question demands thinking about war in different terms, not simply as the negation of sociality (see Harrison 1993:14-21). Claude Levi-Strauss, writing of the essential place of anthropophagic rites in 16th-century Tupinamba culture, pointed to the emergence of a positive image of warfare: [One] not necessarily revealing an imbalance in the relations between the groups and a crisis, but providing, on the contrary, the regular means for assuring the functioning of the institutions; no doubt placing the various tribes in psychological and physical opposition, yet, at the same time, establishing between them the unconscious binding of exchange; perhaps involuntary, but in every case inevitable. [Levi-Strauss 1976[1942], my emphasis and translation] This passage anticipated the way a structuralist-oriented ethnology would address the problem of Amerindian warfare. By affirming warfare as a social relation between groups and not merely as a functional mechanism of internal cohesion, warfare emerges as one of the relational forms constituting supralocal systems. This structuralist inversion of the dominance between terms and relations was a fundamental step in the conceptualization of Amazonian social systems. It allowed the foregrounding of spaces of mediation, placing in relief a complex dialectic between exteriority and interiority, alterity and identity, which marks the region's various sociocosmologies. Scholars who follow this approach, however, presuppose that war is a positive phenomenon by virtue of its identification with reciprocity. It seemed as though thinking of warfare as a social relation implied its reduction to a modality of exchange-"exchange of violence," "bodies," "energy," or "revenge" (see, for instance, Albert 1985; Chaumeil 1985; Lizot 1994). Conceived in the Amazonian context, a universe of symmetrical exchange, warfare emerges as a form of balanced reciprocity. This encapsulation of warfare within the concept of reciprocity, its reduction to a synthetic formula of the gift, raises a number of problems for ethnographic interpretation. In his book on the Curripaco of the Upper Rio Negro, Nicolas Journet expresses this difficulty when he says that either warfare was a non-normative phenomenon, a simple negation of the other in which case one could hardly understand the use of the notion of reciprocity, or it would be necessary to place in evidence a particular cultural conception of "violent exchanges" (1995:185). The problem as envisaged by Journet is the reconciliation of a discourse on symmetrical exchange with a logic of interminable revenge, which is "projective," not "restora- tive," so to speak (projective implies a movement toward the future; restorative, a return to a previous state of equilibrium). The same interpretative difficulty resonates in other contexts since of enemies and pets 935</page><page sequence="4">it was native concepts of revenge that conferred ethnographic legitimacy on subsuming warfare to exchange. For many writers, these concepts served to elucidate the nature of warfare by allowing them to apprehend synthetically, beneath the apparent fragmentation and disorder of practices, la r6alit6 echangiste (the reciprocative reality) of violence in non-state contexts. Amerindian notions of vengeance, however, pose certain difficulties in this regard. First, the meaning common to various native terms for revenge refers to a specific form of exchange which interestingly approximates economic exchange. The terms for revenge are better translated as payment or equivalent, indicating a clear distinction between "to revenge or pay" and "to exchange," at least in the classic sense of the gift.2 Moreover, if the meaning of native categories of revenge implies the idea of equivalence or a discharge of debt, in only some contexts does the practice of revenge actually appear to coincide with its linguistic expression. In Jivaro vendetta warfare, for exemple, where revenge appears as repayment in kind for a preceding death, the dynamic of revenge may emerge as an exchange of calculable and commensurable acts of violence (Descola 1993a:172). Nonetheless, even in this case the synthetic formula of exchange understates its political and phenomenal aspects: in gift exchange, the giver wishes to be repaid; in vengeance, the killer wishes to avoid repayment.3 As Descola notes of revenge, "Mutual predation is the unintentional result of a general rejection of reciprocity, rather than a deliberate exchange of lives through bellicose intercourse" (1996:90). It is precisely this rejection that produces among the Achuar the aggregation of local groups in war houses, whose command falls to a powerful leader (Descola 1993b:319-320). Within the temporal space separating an exchange of deaths, the political power of a leader is expressed and affirmed. The structural temporality of the gift (Bourdieu 1972:221-227, 1980:167-189) is relevant to the notion of revenge, but the difficulty still remains. For the majority of Amazonian societies, the linguistic expression for vengeance does not correspond to its practical reality since vengeance operates in a space of perpetual disequilibrium. Journet notes this problem when he points out that translating the concept of kuada (return, or vengeance) with terms borrowed from the domain of transactions fails to take into account the predominant asymmetry in Curripaco warfare; moreover, repayment cannot fully compensate the death of a member of one's own group (Journet 1995:188, 200). Sterpin confronts the same difficulty in the notion of Nivacle revenge, which "rather than being formulated as a 'debt' is actually a 'credit' which keeps the system in perpetual movement" (1993:58). In an analysis of Tupinamba data, Viveiros de Castro (1992:273-305) also calls attention to this infinitude of revenge and its projective character. In summary, either the notions of payment and revenge miss the meaning of debt repayment or the native discourse on vengeance fails to correspond exactly to social practice. Whichever is the case, I suggest that anthropologists should distinguish clearly between predation and reciprocity. Toward this end, a new language to discuss war in Amazonia is necessary. warfare as productive consumption As a way of approaching the practical reality of Amazonian warfare, I propose a shift of emphasis toward the concept of productive consumption and away from the idea of vengeance and reciprocity. In his study of Melanesian economics, Gregory (1982) addresses the problem of the relation between production and consumption, recovering concepts from Marx's Grun- drisse (1973[1857]:90-94). Marx contrasts two forms of the duality of consumption and production in this work: productive consumption (the expenditure of material and energy in the production of objects) and consumptive production (the alimentary consumption through which human beings produce their own bodies). Gregory refers to the movement of production and productive consumption as an "objectification process," and to the movement of consump- tion and consumptive production as a "personification process." In gift economies, Gregory 936 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="5">observes, "the principles governing the production and exchange of things as gifts are to be explained with reference to control over births, marriages and deaths" (1982:101). When I apply the notion of productive consumption to Amerindian warfare, I am suggesting that in gift economies the production of persons is a phenomenon of the productive, not consumptive, sphere. In this sense, the symbolic ingestion of the enemy that provokes corporeal and spiritual transformations in the killer should not be compared to the consumption of food toward the physical development of workforce; rather, its position in the process of social reproduction is equivalent to productive expenditure in capitalist societies.4 The concept of productive consumption places in relief some distinctive features of Amerin- dian warfare, at the same time obviating some of the implications mentioned above. First, the concept stresses the notions of consumption, expenditure, and loss and de-emphasizes trans- ference and circulation. In treating the theme of warfare, anthropologists have emptied it of its necessary negativity, thereby losing an important dimension, namely the destruction of bodies, or more precisely persons in their material and immaterial constituents. If it is possible to say that "corporality is a focal symbolic idiom" (Seeger et al. 1979:3) in South America, such an idiom would not be limited to the construction of persons and the fabrication of bodies since their destruction and consumption is a necessary part of the same productive process. Flesh and names, skulls and souls were consumed before being used to mediate relations between allies, a fact evident in native representations of homicide and their cannibal symbolic. Consumption is not just loss, but productive expenditure. At home, the death of the enemy produces bodies, names, identities, and virtual existences. Predation is the first moment in a process that produces persons, which, in order to be realized as such, cannot be a pure negation of the other. The consumed enemy cannot be reduced to the condition of object or raw input. Predation in Amazonia is of necessity a social relation between subjects (Viveiros de Castro 1993:186) since affirming the enemy's subjectivity is a prerequisite for the external capture of identities and qualities which in turn serve in the constitution of persons within the group. The notion of productive consumption allows a differentiation between two schemata of social production-one based on appropriation and predation, the other on circulation and exchange. The empirical forms of articulation of these schemata are contextual and variable in time and space. In some social constellations, the second predominates over the first, as for the Upper Xingu, in which the peaceful circulation of goods, bodies, and identities dynamizes the system (Howard 1982). There are other constellations, however, in which the internal accumu- lation and transmission of capacities and symbolic wealth is residual. In these cases, the constitution of complete persons depends on the acquisition, always renewed, of qualities from the outside, in the form of names, songs, or the souls of enemies (Fausto 1997:339-341).5 familiar spirits and familiarizing predation The concept of productive consumption as applied to warfare does more than distinguish two modes of relationship, predation and reciprocity. The combination of consumption and production foregrounds the movement that unites external predation and internal production; that is, the conversion of the enemy's destruction into the production of kin I call the mode of producing persons by means of the destruction of persons. If warfare in Amazonia is to be seen as a particular form of consumption, inflected toward the appropriation of the victim's capacities and incorporeal constituents, I must provide evidence for the mode in which this movement is actually schematized. Accordingly, I shall propose the concept of familiarizingpredation, which I suggest to be the main schema of appropriation in Amazonian symbolic economies. The time is ripe for anthropologists to go beyond their emphasis on affinity as the schema of articulation between outside and inside or as the idiom of mediation between the sphere of kinship and wider levels of sociality (see Viveiros de Castro 1993; Viveiros de Castro and Fausto of enemies and pets 937</page><page sequence="6">1993). There are other relational modes that also play these roles. I refer specifically to adoptive filiation, schematized in the Amerindian context as the protective relationship between father and adopted child or between master and xerimbabo (wild pet).6 These are prototypical relationships of symbolic control in Amazonian cosmologies, and through them I link shaman- ism and warfare to a generalized economy centered on the appropriation of subjectivities from the exterior into the socius. Some ethnographic examples demonstrate the prevalence of this schema of familiarization in four contexts: hunting, shamanism, ritual, and warfare. The first of these is the best known: South American lowland peoples are unfamiliar with livestock domestication, but have always practiced the taming or familiarization of the young of animal prey. The importance, diffusion, and symbolism of this type of adoption has been a theme dealt with by a few authors (in particular Descola 1992 and Erikson 1987), but overall it has received little attention in Amazonian ethnology. This would not have been the case had its connections to another, more productive modality of familiarization been noted. I refer to the shaman's relationship with his auxiliary spirits, frequently called familiars in the anthropological literature. Some examples will serve to illustrate my point. The Wayapi, a Tupi group of the Guiana Shield, speak of the shaman's auxiliaries as "pets" (-rima). There are two categories of pets: the closest are thought to be consubstantial with the shaman, his children, who serve as messengers in contact with other pets at greater dis- tances-such as the masters of animals (Gallois 1988:303-304). Among the Ecuadorian Achuar, the shaman's familiars are conceived as tamed animals. Arranged in a hierarchy, at the apex are found the blue anaconda and the black jaguar, large predators which, domesticated, confer a supreme power on the shaman (Descola 1993b:356-357). Among the Mehinaku of the Upper Xingu, the shamans' familiar spirits are also thought of as pets, as Gregor confirms: Kupatekuma, like all traditional Mehinaku shamans, did not consciously choose to become a yetama [a shaman]. His career began with an encounter with a spirit. In the course of a dream the monkey demon came to him and said, "My grandson, I will stay with you; I will be your pet." [Gregor 1977:335] This adoption, always ambivalent (since it is never exactly known who adopted whom, nor who controls whom), can also be schematized as a father-child relationship. Chaumeil narrates the vision of a Yagua shaman, taken to a subterranean village by an anthropomorphic creature, who tells him: "Don't be afraid, I'm your child.... From now on you are my father.... I shall accompany you until your death" (1983:120). In the same way, the auxiliary spirits (in their majority, animal spirits) caused to descend by Yanomami shamans during trances are consid- ered their children (Albert 1985:316). In some groups, the adoption of the spirit by the shaman can be transformed into an effective relationship between father and child. Among the Shokleng of southern Brazil, a non-Ama- zonian group, "one of the ways in which mortals may establish permanent and friendly relations with the spirits is to adopt one of their children.... Sometimes men take the children of spirits and put them into their wives' wombs, from which they later emerge in the form of human children. Even if a spirit is adopted in its animal form ... it is loved like a pet" (Henry 1964:73). All these groups, despite the linguistic and cultural distances that separate them, conceptu- alize the acquisition of shamanic power as a process of familiarizing non-human entities. The most potent familiar spirits are normally predatory animals, such as the jaguar and anaconda, or bestial beings who eat raw meat and blood. The familiar relationship is modeled as two asymmetric relations involving protection: that of father and child, or that of master and pet. The relationship of symbolic control schematized by familiarization also applies to ritual objects and body ornaments. In ceremonial contexts, these represent powerful alien subjectivi- ties under the control of officiants.7 Thus, for example, among the Txicao, the same term egu designates domesticated animals, abducted children, war trophies, bamboo flutes, and the melodies played on them (Menget 1988:67). In a similar way, in ritual and shamanic situations 938 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="7">among the Barasana, "body ornaments as well as certain musical instruments can be called 'familiar animal'" (Hugh-Jones 1996:141). Finally, the other context in which the schema of familiarization is pervasive is that of warfare: captives and abducted children are often conceptualized as pets. Viveiros de Castro (1992:280-282) called attention to this fact in Tupinamba ritual anthropophagy, while Menget (1988) made the same observation for the capture of children among the Txicao. No one seems to have noticed the relevance of familiarization for understanding the specific relationship between killer and victim. Among the Arawete, for example, the killer captures the spirit of the dead enemy and learns to control it during a period of seclusion and abstinence, putting it to the service of the community as a source of new songs and names (Viveiros de Castro 1996b). Among the Nivacle of the Chaco, the spirit of the victim is conceived as becoming a sort of captive animal under the killer's control (Sterpin 1993:44). The Wari' of Rond6nia conceive of this relationship as filiation: the killer becomes father to the enemy's spirit (Vilaca 1992:105). The binding control established by the killer over his victim's subjectivity should be compared to the relation between shamans and familiar spirits. Both are conceived of as an adoption, as the transformation of a relationship of predation (real or virtual) into control and protection, modeled as the passage from affinity to consanguinity.8 The familiarization of animal young in hunting and the abduction of children in warfare are particular cases of this wider relational structure which articulates predation and familiarization, affinity and consanguinity, exterior and interior. If it is possible to speak of a "symbolic economy of predation," as Viveiros de Castro (1993:184-192) does, it is also necessary to develop its complement, namely a model of the asymmetric relations of symbolic control constituted through homicide and shamanism. Preda- tion is one moment in the process of producing persons, inevitably joined to another-famili- arization. enemies and pets among the Parakana In order to substantiate my claims, I will now turn to my ethnographic data from the Tupi-Guarani speaking Parakana of southeastern Amazonia. "Parakana" is not an auto-denomi- nation. It designates a population of about 700 people, presently distributed in seven villages, five of them on the Tocantins River basin and two on the Xingu River basin, in the state of Para, Brazil (data as of June 1999). They entered permanent relations with Brazilian national society between 1971 and 1984 in the wake of economic frontier expansion in Amazonia. Prior to contact, they exclusively inhabited interfluvial areas and relied basically on hunting terrestrial mammals and tortoises, foraging, and manioc cultivation. The Parakana divide into two large blocs, East and West, which separated at the end of the last century. Thereafter the groups progressively assumed significantly different economic and social-political patterns (see Fausto 1998), but have retained a common shamanic and ritual complex. This complex is specially illuminating to my argument for two reasons: first, it links the mediating activities of the shaman and warrior, articulating shamanism and warfare in a single cycle of predation and familiarization. Strictly speaking, there are no shamans among the Parakana. There are no specialists who fulfill the public function of shamans, nor are there people to whom an enduring curative power is attributed. The only shamanic ability recognized is that of dreaming, to which all adult men (and some women) have potential access since its development is intimately linked to warfare and ritual predation. Second, the Parakana demonstrate a higher degree of generalization and abstraction of the killer-victim relationship. A direct link between the former and the spirit of the latter is not established. What is acquired in homicide is not a hypostasized subjectivity but a generic capacity to dream, which in turn is associated with two impersonal characteristics of the victims: the smell of their blood (-pyji'oa) of enemies and pets 939</page><page sequence="8">and their "magic-fat" (-kawahiwa), which impregnate the killer, making him both dangerous and fertile. The fertility of homicide only expresses itself through the mediation of dreams.9 The Parakana distinguish everyday interaction from dreaming by opposing two modes of presentation of beings: the concrete being and its double. In native terms, this is expressed as ipiret6 (his or her real skin) and ha'owa (his or her representation). -A'owa is not an active soul that is liberated in dreams, but a representation of the active self that only exists during dreaming. In general, the term applies to all forms of representation that imply substitution. Dreaming is a mode of relationship with everything outside the universe of kin. A person dreams about others (amote), beings who do not belong to the universe of kin. Everything that presents itself to the dreamer and interacts verbally with him is designated akwawa, which might be translated as enemy. The minimal structure of the dream is that of a relationship, in a communicative context, between two subjects, the dreamer's double and his interlocutor. This interlocutor does not necessarily appear in human form but is endowed with attributes definitive of the human condition: it has a name, intentionality, and verbal agency. Dreams make possible a universal communication among humans, animals, and natural and cultural objects. The relational schema established between the dreamer and his interlocutors is that of master and pet. The dream enemy is said to be a pet (te'omawa) of the dreamer or his magic-prey (temiahiwa).'0 The reciprocal of te'omawa is -jara, which means owner or master. Thus, the dreamer is the master, while his interlocutors are pets. The owners have a volitional power exceeding that of their pets, since the latter are under the formers' control, as the verbal form of te'omawa indicates: -e'omam, (to be completely powerless), which applies to the state of a person who is about to die or faint.11 The pet is that which loses potency or, shifting ahead a little, that which loses self-consciousness and lets itself be dominated by the other's perspective, behaving not as an enemy but as an ally. The relations constituted through dreaming are distinct, then, from the usual interaction with others, due to the exclusion of predation. The potency of dream akwawa, however, is inferior only at the level of volition, since they are the true owners of therapeutic techniques, music, and names. The structure of dreams, therefore, consists of an interaction between the dreamer and a domesticated enemy, one who remains under the dreamer's control but who surpasses him in shamanic science. In this sense, Parakana dream pets are similar to shamans' familiar spirits in other Amazonian groups. They are distinguishable, though, in two aspects: first, they are classified in a general category of sociological alterity, akwawa (the most powerful among them are, in effect, hyperboles of real enemies). Second, they are not merely helpers, but are the true shamans who actually accomplish the cures.12 opetymo: cannibal melodies Songs are the main gift from dream enemies. The interaction in dreams invariably results in their transmission from the akwawa to the dreamer. It is these songs that guarantee the dream's legitimacy and its social productivity: dreaming is equivalent to obtaining songs. If someone claims to have dreamt but is unable to reproduce the music that s/he heard, s/he is thought to be lying about having dreamed. Creativity is thought to result from the interaction with alien subjectives, not from the individual's mental activities. Various designations exist for these songs, but the most frequently used term isjawara (jaguar). The designation refers to a surplus of activity, since the feline, the main predator of rainforest Amazonia, is associated by indigenous peoples with creative potency and the capacity for action. The jaguar-song is, simultaneously, a powerful gift and an icon of the dreamer's agency. The dreamer's epithet is, precisely, "master of the jaguars" (jawajara). The song, as well as the enemy who chanted it, are the dreamer's "wild pets." 940 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="9">Jaguar-songs have a socially productive fate in Parakana rituals, in particular in opetymo (tobacco festival), which takes place practically every year. Opetymo can be performed as a war celebration, as a conciliation of internal tensions, at the instigation of young people, or at times when game is abundant. 3 To simplify description of the ritual, I divide it into three phases: first, the rehearsals, which I call "fattening up the jaguars" (jawara-pyrotawa); then the inauguration or "entrapping" (imogetawa); and, finally, the "execution" (ijokatawa) properly speaking. The first phase corresponds to the nocturnal rehearsals that precede the ritual. At this time, the songs are donated and memorized. Armed men meet in the open part of the village and surround the most powerful dreamers. One of these dreamers chants a song and announces which akwawa gave him the jawara during dreaming. Everyone then repeats the song numerous times until they have memorized it. The Parakana call these actions "to nurture [fatten up] the jaguar" (-pyro jawara) in the same sense that a husband nurtures (-pyro) his future wife while she is still a child, by bringing her game. After two or three nights, the dance rehearsals begin. The songs are given to the individuals who wish to participate in the ritual. The dreamer sings and announces: "Here is your jaguar, my nephew [friend, brother-in-law ... ]." The recipient of the song then refers to it as "my jaguar" (jejawara), "my victim" (jeremiara), or "that which I have" (jeremireka, a term which can also be applied to one's own wife). Thus, during the preparations the "masters of the jaguar" give their pets to those who are going to dance in the festival. This gift is imperative: the song's owner cannot execute it himself. He must offer it to a third party who will be its executor in the full sense. The singing and dancing is conceived as an act of homicide: the verb employed to designate the ritual performance is "to kill" (-joka). For this reason, the songs danced during rehearsals or in a preceding festival cannot be reused; they are dead. As such, they can no longer reflect the complex dialectic between the inside and the outside, which, in the dream as in the ritual, involves a dream-enemy, a dreamer, and a kinsperson. This dialectic involves two prestations: the gift of the song to the dreamer by the akwawa and its transference by the former to a kinsperson who executes it in public. The reproduction of ritual life depends on a continual appropriation of new songs from the outside. The song's donation corresponds to its "becoming-enemy" or "enemization": it ceases to be the donor's pet and instead becomes the recipient's victim. This transfer involves a recurring opposition between enmity, ferocity, and self-consciousness on one hand, and familiarization, taming, and alienation on the other. This opposition pervades Amazonian symbolism in contexts of shamanism and warfare (see Fausto 1997:341; Sterpin 1993:59-60). As I will show below, re-enemization is a central part of warrior festivals, a necessary step toward ritual execution (in both senses of the word). Familiarized others are those who have relinquished control of their creative capacities, by surrendering their own "perspectives" in favor of their masters'.14 Familiarized others are enemies who have lost consciousness of their condition as enemies and have assumed their masters' point of view. There is no sense in killing such alienated beings in the ritual. The cannibal mode of appropriation requires that the alters be in possession of a different point of view, which is denoted by their fierceness. This is why real or symbolic captives must be re-enemized in order to be ritually executed in warfare festivals. On the morning before the start of the festival, the men construct the ritual house. It is named tokaja, a term which also designates a blind used in hunting and cages for imprisoned animals. In some Tupi-Guarani groups, cognates of tokaja designate small houses, where shamans confine themselves in order to attract their familiar spirits. At nightfall, the performers are taken behind the tokaja, initiating the second phase to which I referred above: the imogetawa, or entrapping. Inside the house, a powerful dreamer sings the songs that will be "killed" in the festival. He is "the trapper" (imogetara), the one who introduces the songs and the dancers within the tokaja. When he finishes singing, the performers are taken inside the ritual house by of enemies and pets 941</page><page sequence="10">the audience where they must sleep until the end of the festival. Thus, opetymo is inaugurated by the imprisonment of the song and its performers (both are representations of the dream-en- emy) within the tokaja. The main part of the ritual begins the following morning and lasts from three to four days. It consists of the execution of the songs. Carrying a long cigar made from the inner bark of the tauari tree (Couratari oblongifolia), one of the performers begins to dance and sing, accompa- nied by a chorus of women. When he stops, another dancer takes the cigar and starts his own performance. The individual renditions continue throughout the day. There are innumerable ritual motifs (too numerous to detail here) in which the performers embody different social positions. The relation that interests me here, however, is between the two facets of the performer himself, that is, as both killer and victim. He represents, also in the theatrical sense of the term, the akwawa donor of the song, who can be as much animal as human enemy.15 Simultaneously, he is the killer, since his performance is conceived as an execution of the jaguar-song, which is said to be akwawa-ra'owa (enemy's double).16 The synthetic language of the ritual fuses the terms of predation: the pairs "killer-victim" and "hunter-game" are amalgamated in a single person, the performer. This fusion between predator and prey is a theme particularly important in Viveiros de Castro's analysis of the relation between Arawete killers and their victims, a fusion which, as he asserts, is both interiorization of the Other and an exteriorization of the Self: "the domestication of the former accompanies the 'ensavaging' of the latter" (1996b:98). The Arawete killer preys ontologically on his victim, which turns into his familiar spirit, supplying him in dreams with the songs of the pirahe, or dance festival (Viveiros de Castro 1992:238-248). The Parakana construction differs from this in that it is more comprehensive, linking more intermediary operations. shamanic rite, warrior festival The complete cycle of predation and familiarization among the Parakana-articulating warfare, dreaming, and ritual-is represented in Figure 1. I summarize the sequence as follows. Warfare predation creates the possibility of interacting with enemies through dreams, rather than a direct relationship between the killer and his victim's spirit. In dreaming, enemies (humans or non-humans) are familiarized and accordingly become song donors. Their songs constitute the dreamer's wild pets, which must be re-enemized to qualify for ritual killing. Toward this end, they are given to a third party. During opetymo, this party, representing as much the enemy-victim as the kin-executor, kills the jaguar-song. The moment of transmission of the song to the third party is crucial as it allows a short-circuit of the system, since predation during opetymo also leads to a maturation requisite fordeveloping the capacity to dream (represented in Figure 1 by the contra-flowing arrow). At the same time, warfare predation -&gt; dream familiarization -&gt; re-enemization - ritual predation warfare shamanism transmission ritual Figure 1. Model offamiliarizating predation among the Parakan Figure 1. Model of familiarizating predation among the Parakan2. 942 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="11">ritual predation refers back to that of warfare: it realizes the ontological predation elided in the killer-victim relationship of warfare. Consequently, the ritual operates in two registers: warlike and shamanic. The shamanic function of opetymo is expressed by another term through which it is known: paje, a word of a thousand meanings-the festival, the songs, ceremonial friends, lovers, as well as shamanic power. This designation expresses one of the core meanings of the Parakana opetymo: it is a ritual of initiation into shamanism (hence the centrality of tobacco smoking, characteristic of all South American shamanism).17 Participation in opetymo culminates in a putative transformation of the executor, leading to the maturation of active masculine attributes which manifest themselves as the ability to speak in public, to sing, and to dream. As participation in opetymo furnishes dreams, the ritual has an auto-generative aspect: jaguar- songs are killed in order to familiarize dream enemies, in turn allowing the appropriation of new jaguars to be killed. Ideally, the system can operate without war, a flexibility that sacrificial machines must have in order not to collapse. At the same time, as noted above, the ritual is an actualization of the ontological predation elided in warfare, since the Parakana do not postulate the incorporation of a victim's soul by the killer. The enemy killed in the ritual can be seen as a substitute for the enemy killed face-to-face. He is akwawa-ra'owa, (the enemy's double), his substitute, exactly like a head or a scalp in other South American rituals (see below). The fusion between killer and victim in the ritual performance, as well as the idiom of homicide applied to the vocal act and the song, demonstrate that the Parakana opetymo is a warfare ritual, a representation of primary predation. Moreover, the other designation for the dream akwawa, beyond pet, is "magic-victim" (temia- hiwa). In the ritual, the immaterial aspect of the prey of warfare and hunting are symbolically put to death. These pursuits are to opetymo as the second part of the dreams of (bringing in the enemy) are to the first: in hunting and war, animals and humans are killed in their "true skin" (-pirete); in the ritual, it is their representation or double (-a'owa) that is executed. Both registers (warlike and shamanic) are expressed in the opetymo ritual, which among the Parakana has war as its dominant idiom. In the Parakana system, the shamanic ritual is immediately a warfare ritual, just as the familiar spirit is an enemy. This is a society in which, strictly speaking, there are no shamans, only warriors or a society in which all men can be shamans by being warriors. waratoa: life producing death Opetymo promotes the development of a person's creative agency, particularly that of the male person.18 By means of representational contact with the akwawa, vocal homicide, and the swallowing of cigar smoke, a transformation takes place that gradually enables the performer to control potent external entities and, by this means, to attain a long and productive life. This capacity of establishing relations of control allows the giving of names (i.e., singularity) and songs (i.e., victims) to children, grandchildren, and the children of real or classificatory siblings. In this sense, opetymo is a central operation in the production of persons. Opetymo does not involve explicit fertility symbolism, as occurs in a number of clearly "life-giving" Amazonian warfare rites (Menget 1996:135). Such symbolism arises in another Parakana ceremonial context, the "rhythm baton festival," which is a synthesis of the tobacco festival and the festival of flutes.19 In contrast to these festivals, which take place almost every year, the baton ritual is infrequent. It is considered very costly (tepy'ete). On the occasions when it was performed in the past, this ritual followed the period of abstinence after homicide, in substitution for opetymo. The Western Parakana have performed the ritual six times in the last seventy years, each time as a warfare commemoration (except for one after contact, performed explicitly "for the Whites to see"). of enemies and pets 943</page><page sequence="12">The ritual is called waratoa: the term for a baton about two meters in length, fabricated from a light colored bamboo. It is used as a percussion instrument; the sound is produced by pounding the baton against the soil. A special design is applied around its upper aperture, or "mouth"; unlike other patterns which reproduce the skin of animals, this one is non-figurative. Considered the most beautiful and sophisticated design, this pattern is used primarily to decorate war arrows, opetymo dancers, and the rhythm baton-three contexts associated with the creative dynamic of predation and familiarization. The baton festival is divided into three parts: the first is an opetymo pure and simple, such as described above, but of shorter duration. It concludes in the late afternoon on the first day. The second part then begins, inaugurated by the distribution of a thick porridge of palm heart and honey (a product particular to the flute festival). The opetymo dancers transform into "owners of the porridge" and distribute the porridge to their sisters, an act said to be like breast-feeding. The dancers pass from being providers of incorporeal potency to providers of food. The porridge consumed, the festival continues throughout the night without the participation of the dancers, who rest in the tokaja. At dawn the next day, the third part of the festival begins. The dancers resume command of the ritual. One of them takes the baton and, singing and dancing, carries it along the same path followed the day before with the opetymo cigar. The ritual action is analogous to that of opetymo, with the same predatory symbolism, but instead of carrying the cigar-the shamanic vehicle, par excellence-the dancer carries a baton which is said to be his "magic-prey" (temiahiwa). In the open part of the village, he halts and secures the waratoa in his armpit; a woman (usually, his wife) attempts to disengage the instrument. Freeing himself from her, the dancer returns to the dance, pounding the bamboo against the soil and, after repeating this routine several times, turns toward his house. He sings for the last time. At this point, it is said that he "really killed" (-jokaete). The spouse of the next dancer fetches the baton and carries it to the tokaja, where the same sequence is started once more, repeated successively until the finish. The songs chanted in the third part of the ritual, newly obtained through dreams, differ thematically from those killed in opetymo. Known as baton-songs (waratoa-je'egara), they speak of the children who will be seized in the ritual and who cry within the bamboo. The other name by which the festival is known comes from this image: moropyhykawa (seizure of people). The baton festival is a ritual for acquiring new existences. In pounding the bamboo against the ground, the performer produces a variety of sounds: some are associated with the cry of animals, others are considered the crying of the baton's child. The Parakana mention various individuals brought by the waratoa during the ritual. These are termed "children of the baton" (waratoa-memyra). The bamboo called "father" during the second part of the ritual is also a "mother." The virtual beings enclosed in the baton are its memyra, a term by which women designate their children. The dancer, therefore, carries a female-baton which, like a uterus, contains "future children" (konomi-roma). The weeping (sound produced by the baton struck against the ground) announces the exit of a child from within the waratoa and his or her entry into the uterus of the "future mother" (-'y-roma). The action of the women who try to take the baton from the dancer is thought of as an insemination. The dancer fertilizes the women and, from this perspective, the baton is also a father, or more exactly, a penis. The child imprisoned in the waratoa is the carrier's "magic-prey" (temiahiwa), a prey he transfers to the uterus of a woman (the men say that "our [exclusive] magic-prey enter inside them"). Simultaneously penis and womb, the baton ex- presses a procreative relationship between husband and wife. The three main Parakana rituals are representations and actualizations of the male capacity to master female functions linked to the production of persons and to confer on them a public character. In the flute festival, the men appear as nourishers, breast-feeding the collectivity; in 944 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="13">opetymo, as suppliers of potent incorporeal entities (songs and names); and in waratoa, as masters of the group's reproduction, to the extent that they promote women's ferti I ity. By means of ritual life, the general conditions for the production of persons appear as the effects of the male activity of predation and familiarization in warfare and shamanism. Parakana rituals do not exclude women from performing, much the opposite. They strongly thematize the relations between brother and sister, husband and wife, and lovers.20 The point is that, by means of the ritual, men publicly present themselves as capable of mediating and controlling the powerful external entities necessary to the group's reproduction. consumption and production of persons As I have shown, the tobacco festival (opetymo) and the flute festival (takwara-rero'awa), normally consecutive, are performed together in the baton ritual. The first part is opetymo properly speaking, while the second is a transformation of the flute festival. In the third part, the baton substitutes for the cigar, which the dancer carried in opetymo, and transforms from an attractor of dream enemies into an attractor of children. The analogy between the two is expressed through the common terminology: temiahiwa (magic-prey), which applies equally to the dream enemy and the baton, the received song and the child. An equivalence is manifest here between the master-pet relation and the father-child relation. From enabler of shamanism, opetymo becomes an enabler of female fertility by means of its contrary (the flute festival). Opetymo's outcomes are indirect (it brings forth dreaming, in which are obtained names that confer singularity to individual existence and songs which make new rituals possible). Waratoa (the baton ritual) directly transfers future persons to society. The conversion of the killer-victim relationship into that of master-pet is homologous to its conver- sion into a genitor-progeny relationship. Thus: killer-victim -- master-wild pet : killer-victim -&gt; father-child Further, the master-pet relationship can be substituted by its products-songs and names-or more precisely, by the production of personal agency. In turn, the procreative relationship can be exchanged for its product: concrete persons. The killer-victim relationship, finally, gives rise to the idea of consumption, in the sense of the destruction of bodies and capacities. So, we have: consumption -&gt; production of capacities:: consumption -&gt; production of beings The amalgamation of these homologous terms provides the formula for what I call the mode of producing persons by means of the destruction of persons. consumption of persons -&gt; production of persons (beings and capacities) The relation between the moment of predation and the moment of familiarization is one of contradiction, in such a way that the passage from the former to the latter implies both negation and conservation of the negated moment; that is, familiarization affected by predation. The formula's arrow indicates this negative movement, which is realized only through work-sym- bolic work that gains conspicuous public and collective expression in the rituals. testing the model: trophy hunting The warfare rituals are the culminating point of a logic that socializes the homicidal act, a logic that multiplies the productive effects of predation. As the apex of bellicose action, the rituals express in a more consummate form the movement that leads from the destruction to the production of persons. In order to assess the generality of Parakana data, I shall now extend my analysis to other South American warfare rites. of enemies and pets 945</page><page sequence="14">I begin with the 1 6th-century coastal Tupi, comparing the movement that led from warfare to the cannibal feast with what in the contemporary Parakana case leads from warfare predation to ritual predation in opetymo. Toward this end, I return to the "model of familiarizing predation among the Parakana" (Figure 1). In order to render this model comparable with Tupinamba ritual anthropophagy, it is necessary to expand the operation denominated re-enemization (or transmission) into three moments: first, that which the Parakana call jawara-pyrotawa (fattening up the jaguars) which consists of the donation and memorization of the songs before the ritual; second, the actual moment of re-enemization which consists of the receiving of the jaguar-vic- tim by the man who will kill it in the festival; third, the moment of capture (imogetawa) when the dancers and their songs are imprisoned in the ritual house. These three moments yield the following sucession: warfare predation -&gt; dream familiarization -&gt; fattening -&gt; re-enemization -&gt; capture -&gt; ritual predation The same sequence can be discerned in Tupinamba ritual cannibalism if actual familiariza- tion is substituted for dream familiarization. A captive taken in war (always a man) was "adopted" by the family of his future executioner, who fed and protected him. His condition was that of a wife-taker within an uxorilocal regime: a man under the strict control of his father-in-law and brothers-in-law. This situation has frequently been compared to that of a pet (see Viveiros de Castro 1992:280). In a 16th-century account, Hans Staden recounts that, on the return voyage after his capture, the warriors expressed precisely this, saying to him: "xe remimbaba in de" (you are my wild pet) (Staden 1974:84). The social position of the captive altered on the eve of execution: his captors apprehended him, separating him from his adopting family. He was then forced to assume the position of an enemy by being subjected to a rite of capture. Finally, they killed and devoured him. In this war complex, the movement predation-familiarization-predation (which corresponds to the process of socialization and multiplication of the effects of the homicidal act) led to the appropriation of new victims and new names.21 Like Parakana opetymo, Tupi ritual anthropo- phagy was not permeated by a symbolism of fertility, but was instead related to processes in the transformation-maturation of personal capacities. The Tupinamba, furthermore, sacrificed the children fathered by the prisoner during his captivity, thus indicating that the central problem for them was not producing new beings, but conferring additional singularities on those who already existed. The life giving symbolism of the Parakana waratoa festival appears in other warfare rituals, such as the Munduruku head ritual cycle, which involves the same dialectic of predation and familiarization. Described by 19th-century chroniclers, the ritual consisted of two main parts. In the first, the head was introduced into the killer's clan, which had to adorn the trophy with the specific attributes of its agnatic segment. The rite marked the beginning of the head hunter's period of abstinence and his condition as "mother of the white-lipped peccary"-that is, enabler of game (the killer and his trophy were thought to promote the fertility of game). The cycle was completed the following year, when the teeth extracted from the trophy were threaded onto a cotton belt. The festival occasioned the performance of the theme of re-enemization and recapture: young men, painted and tonsured, ran to the forest to be imprisoned and conducted back by adults of the opposite moiety. Afterthis performance, the celebration concluding period of post-homicide abstinence took place (Murphy 1958:53-58). The powers of the head and of the killer do not appear to have been restricted to the fertility of the hunt. According to Menget (1993:314,320), the trophy was associated with the physical reproduction of the group itself-that is, to the production of children-and to renewal of the warfare dynamic, since it was supposed that the belt of teeth increased the wearer's chances of obtaining new victims. The ritual had two outcomes-new lives and new deaths-with the deaths inaugurating a new cycle. 946 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="15">The same schema is found in the Jivaro ritual of the shrunken heads (tsantsa), which was still performed well into the 20th century. The entire cycle was composed of two main parts separated by an interval of at least one year. The first occurred soon after the expedition's return and was called numpenk ("his own blood"). In the festival, bird blood was sprinkled on the inner thighs of the killers, while the women intoned songs about this fictional menstruation (Taylor 1994:82).22 The ritual, which inaugurated the killer's period of abstinence and intro- duced the trophy into the group, equalled a male menarche, indicating the development of the head hunters' reproductive capacities. The severed head also underwent a process of transfor- mation. Traces of its origin were obliterated in order for it to incarnate a generic Jivaro identity. All the orifices were sewn up and the head was submitted "to a learning of its new social space, taken to visit the house in its cardinal points and familiarized, according to the song's formula, to its 'land of adoption'" (Descola 1993b:305). The captive head was thus re-socialized into his new group. According to Karsten (1989:358), the head hunter gained control over his victim's spiritduring the interval between the two main parts of the tsantsa ritual. This relationship between killer and victim, enacted in dreams, ensured the growth of the familiar animals, raised in order to be killed in the final festival. This festival, called amiamu (fulfillment), concluded the transformation of the killer and the head, which began after the homicide. In the course of the ritual, the captive head was symbolically re-killed, through a "verbal recreation" of the raid during which the enemy was put to death and beheaded (Taylor 1993:673). This same theme reappeared in a parallel sequence. The peccaries, captured and raised before the festival, were liberated, recaptured, and killed. The meat was then given to the guests as a "substitute" (imiak) of the enemy (Descola 1993b:303).23 These cycles of predation and familiarization concluded with the enemy's transformation into a new life in the killer's group: "the songs addressed to the head by the women in the last episodes of the amiamu clearly announced the head's final destiny: to be a fetus" (Taylor 1994:96). The process initiated with the figuration of a male menarche completed with the production of new lives in the bellies of women.24 In the rites described above, the domesticated enemy is put to two uses: the amplification and self-renewal of the homicide cycle, and the production of new persons. In other words, on one hand, the ritual work allows a multiplication of the acts of predation and their socialization; on the other hand, it processes the appropriation of an alien subjectivity through the transfor- mation of the killer-victim relation into a father-child or namer-named relation. The majority of rituals contain both outcomes, although some of them emphasize the first, others the second. Opetymo, for example, is not as explicit as waratoa insofar as it concerns the appropriation of new existences. Tupinamba anthropophagy does not thematize the production of a new life, unlike the Jivaro tsansta ritual. Some systems directly associate the generative potency of the killer with digested enemy blood; others interpose an additional substance, such as sweet porridge (among the Parakana) or beer (among the Arara of the Middle Xingu).25 Additionally, not all the groups conceive of the movement that leads from warfare to ritual as a process that transforms the victim's spirit. As the Parakana data show, there is no need to postulate an enemy soul in order for warfare to be conceived as a mode of appropriating subjectivities. This postulation is only the most explicit case and can be found, for example, among the Nivacle of the Chaco. The Nivacle establish a clear parallel between the killer's familiarization of the victim's soul during the period of abstinence and seclusion and the process of maturing the scalp, the physical-symbolic support of such subjectivity (Sterpin 1993). It is not only the killer and the trophy that are transformed between the first and second part of the warfare rituals. The symbolic work extends to the collectivity itself. The trophy is appropriated by the group, collectivizing the effects of the enemy's destruction. This amplifica- tion is not specific to the ritual, but is manifest at various moments within the complex of warfare. Practices socializing the act of homicide are well documented (see, for instance, Albert of enemies and pets 947</page><page sequence="16">1989:638; Karsten 1989:334; Verswijver 1992:179); these allow an increase in the number of killers who submit to seclusion (see Fausto 1997:196). This amplification is accompanied by a multiplication of the external attributes obtained and transmitted for the self or for the group (names, songs, existential possibilities) by means of homicide. In a general way, the logic of Amazonian warfare inheres in extracting as much as possible from single deaths (not in killing the largest possible number of enemies). In other words, the region's societies appear to concentrate on expanding the symbolic efficacy of warfare, rather than its efficiency. Finally, ritual gives Amazonian warfare its prominent public character, turning familiarizing predation into a general schema for the production of persons and socio-political units. Trophies function as supports for the mediation between allies and separation from adversaries, shaping the nexus of proximity and distance, continuity, and discontinuity. The enemy and his or her attributes afford mediation of social relations on a scale that exceeds the circulation of material wealth objects. The flux of material goods-luxury items (e.g., stones, feathers, and collars) and utensils (e.g., graters, curare, axes)-is immersed in a political space constituted less by relations of commercial exchange than by the flux of bodies and immaterial goods effected by marriage and warfare: sons-in-law and wives obtained at a minimal distance; captives, names, songs, flesh, heads, and trophies captured at a medial distance. This last flux is polarized amid the minimal alterity of the real affine and the unassimilatable alterity of the unknown other. The participation of people from many local groups in the final part of warfare rites, normally glossed as the "big festival," expresses the fact that the rites are the maximal moment of reunion and constitution of networks of friendship and hostility, which together structure the complete universe of a group's social relations. The ritual not only allows homicidal acts to acquire a maximal productivity by socializing and multiplying them but also articulates a series of isolated acts in a mode of generalized social reproduction based on the appropriation and familiarization of alien subjectivities. conclusion In this article, I focused on the relations of predation and familiarization established between subjects who are not recognized as kin, a condition which the Parakana define by genealogical ties and conduct appropriate to the relationship: to be kin (te'ynia) is to be guided in actions by an ideal of peaceful exchange and sharing. The "we" is delineated through generous acts, solidarity, and the absence of predation. This ideally secure sphere of sociality is, however, an ens incompletum, (incomplete being), incapable of self-reproduction in isolation. As Overing has written of Amazonian societies, "The achievement of the social state itself, and thus of the world of the interior, requires the force and creative powers of those different from self, and without the benefit of such alterity there can be no fertility and no productive capacity" (1996:53). There is, however, more than one mode of producing the interior and the exterior, the self and the other, and of establishing a dynamic between them. In this article, I have focused on Amazonian systems in which productive difference is placed in the exterior, and in which the primary mode of interaction with this exterior consists of predation: predation of animals that need to be de-subjectified in order to serve as pure food, and predation of humans that need to be subjectified in order to serve in the production of new subjectivities. The first movement of appropriation leads to consumptive production, alimentary consumption by means of which human beings produce their own bodies; the second, pertains to productive consumption, expenditure of persons in order to produce persons. The development of the person's reproductive capacities (in a wide sense) depends on the appropriation of a surplus of agency (that is of intention and activity) which exists in unequal levels in the human and non-human world. In general, Amerindian thought appears to associate 948 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="17">this surplus with both the predator position-the jaguar and the warrior are, recurrently, the prototypical examples of powerful and productive beings-and with the alimentary mode of hemato-homophagy. Eating raw, bloody flesh is the equivalent, in substantialist language, of ontological predation. One consumes the subject's activity, un-neutralized by fire, in contrast to a day-to-day alimentation which requires the removal of all traces of blood through cooking. This is why Amerindians conceive of cannibalism as homophagy, despite the fact that human flesh is always consumed cooked.26 The phenomenon I call familiarizing predation is precisely the process through which alien subjects are consumed and controlled in order to produce new subjects on the inside of the group. The model relation of control in these cosmologies is not that of master and slave-since the system is not based on the appropriation of work in order to produce goods-but of master and wild pet. This form of mastery is exercised in practice through the familiarization of animals and the abduction of foreign children. As Descola has noted (1994), there is a strict correlation between treatment of the human and non-human other, which he formulated as a structural homology: affine: consanguine :: enemy : captive child :: prey : familiar animal (pet) I believe this formula can be generalized, since the adoption of captive children and animal young are only particular cases of a wider relational structure that involves the familiarization of human spirits in warfare and of animal spirits in shamanism. This result can be visualized in the following way, substituting the colons of the formula for arrows that indicate the movement from the conversion of enmity into familiarity, and of affinity into consanguinity: affine - consanguine:: enemy -&gt; victim's spirit:: prey - familiar spirit kinship warfare shamanism I am not suggesting that specific animal prey become spirit familiars of shamans, but that the relation of predation between humans and non-humans has as its counterpart the relation of familiarization between shamans and animal spirits. The same applies to warfare: the Parakana, as noted above, do not conceive themselves as familiarizing spirits of dead enemies. Warfare predation, however, is logically and symbolically articulated with dream familiarization and ritual predation. Familiarizing predation should neither be understood as simple identification with the other, nor as mere negation of the other. The predatory copula can be thought of as sublation (Aufhebung): the predator negates his prey at the same time he affirms it, since he emerges from the relationship as a new subject affected by the victim's subjective capacities.27 Various authors call attention to this point, particularly Viveiros de Castro in speaking of the killer's "alteration" (1992; 1996b). In a similar manner, Taylor (1985:160) refers to the "transitory alienation of Self, its transmutation into Other, so as to be capable of becoming fully Self." This "transitory alienation" or "alteration" should not be thought of as empathy or as an opening up to alterity in the abstract, but as a movement appropriating alien vital principles of subjectification. It involves mobilizing the other's perspective to benefit the reproduction of the group itself, an act that implies a dialectic of control in which the predator risks alienating himself definitively. The risk of alienation that leads to seeing enemies as friends and kin as adversaries is a recurrent theme in the symbolism of warfare. This struggle of perspectives is also a hallmark of shamanism-hence the ambiguity of the shaman and the warrior in Amazonia. At the same time as they control other subjectivities, which make possible the reproduction of life, they also are affected by them. The relationship between master and wild pet is always ambivalent, since one can never entirely neutralize the subjective potency of the other. In its ambiguity, this relationship projects the spectre of predation onto the interior: if the other is entirely controlled, completely alienated, and domesticated, then it serves for nothing. To be powerful, shamans and warriors can never fully control their wild pets, having to ensure the subjective condition of the other and run the risk of losing their own. This is the misfortune (and fortune) of the savage master. of enemies and pets 949</page><page sequence="18">notes Acknowledgments.

I also wish to express my thanks to Claude Levi-Strauss, as well as to the anonymous reviewers and Michael Herzfeld, previous editor of American Ethnologist, for their insightful comments and criticisms. My greatest debt is to the Parakana who generously helped me in all sorts of ways. 1. However compelling this motif is, it has not prevailed alone. Western imaginings oscillated between the image of the barbarian cannibal stuck in a state of chronic warfare and that of the noble savage living in natural liberty. This split image was characteristic of 1 7th- and 18th-century political philosophy and remains so today of 20th-century anthropological thought. Indeed, it is at the very root of anthropological conceptual models and descriptive modes. 2. In Tupi-Guarani languages, the cognates of the verb tepy(Montoya 1876) mean to pay and to revenge. Among the Kayap6 panh translates as vengeance, payment, and compensation (Verswijver 1992:173). The Arawakan Curripaco employ the term kuada, with the same meanings (Journet 1995:184). The Wari' (Txapakura) render the movement of revenge by the Portuguese pagar um parente morto ("to pay for a killed kinsperson") (Vila:a 1992:96). In the Chaco, the Nivacle vocable caatshai, or "revenge," appears to contain the morpheme sha, meaning "price or payment" (Sterpin 1993:58). 3. In this sense, one may approximate vengeance to competitive exchange. For instance, a Northwest Coast chief, who overwhelmed his competitors in a festival may well have wished to avert any return (Kan 1989:213-254). Unlike the Jivaro killer, however, he would be obliged to accept retribution if his competitor sponsored another festival. 4. For applications of the notion of consumptive production in South American ethnology, see Gow 1991:119-121 and McCallum 1996:50. I do not see our uses as necessarily opposed, although they can hardly be conflated. For a discussion on the general issue here involved, see Fausto 1997:148-153, McCallum 1998, Overing 1999, and Viveiros de Castro 1996a:187-191. 5. It is important to note that I am not suggesting the reduction of the Maussian concept of the gift to the Marxist concept of circulation. As Gregory shows (1982:42), exchange in a gift economy differs from that in a market economy in that a gift relation establishes ties between subjects as subjects. Exchange in these societies is "subjectifying" and is inserted within a process aimed at the production of persons. Predation is also subjectifying and could be thought of as another figure of the "world of the gift." The point is that the operation of predation cannot be simply lumped with that of exchange, nor is it possible to subsume a priori the first to the second. 6. Xerimbabo comes from a Tupi-Guarani word (mimbawa) and was incorporated into the Portuguese lexicon in the possessive form of the first person singular (xe-r-emimbawa). It designates the "familiar animal." Xerimbabo is a rarely employed word in Portuguese. Pets are normally called bichos de estimacao. By using two different terms (xerimbabo and bicho de estimaco), one avoids conflating the status of pets in Western and Amerindian societies. In Western culture, pets are normally well domesticated species, as Canis familiaris and Felis domesticus. They are conceptually deprived of most of the contents associated with wildness and fierceness. I will translate xerimbabo as "pet," sometimes using the qualification "wild" to point to its particular status in Amerindian cultures. 7. These synecdoches are based on an ontology that establishes a strong relation between particular corporal attributes and subjective capacities (see Viveiros de Castro 1996c:130-135). For example, the de-subjectification of the hunt by the Makuna shaman, which allows the animal's spirit to return to its original home and be reborn, does not consist in extracting a generic and abstract soul from the animal, but its "weapons"-its distinctive physical attributes, which differentiate it from other animate beings (Arhem 1996:188). With regard to the use of the subjective capacities of animals, the symbolic operation is symmetrically inverse: "When ornaments are made with the 'fur/hair' of wild animals killed for their meat, it is not the whole of the animal which is domesticated, but only the potentially dangerous powers of its 'weapons'" (Hugh-Jones 1996:141). 8. However, there exists another model of familiarization, that of the father-in-law-jaguar, which appears to have been prominant in Tupinamba anthropophagy (see Fausto 1997:243-247). 9. The Western Parakana usually distinguish three categories of victims: adult men (awohoa), their wives (haty'ohoa), and children (ta'yrohoa). It is said that killing a man "makes one have lots of magic-fat," whereas by killing a woman or a child one gets none. Accordingly, the period of abstinence is much shorter in these last cases. 10. The most appropriate translation of temiahiwa would be "magic-patient." It can be decomposed into t-emi-ahiwa (person marker-patient marker-"magic"). -Ahiwa is a nominal modifier indicating immateriality and potency and is suffixed to almost all of shamanism's key terms. In turn, the word for "prey" or "victim" 950 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="19">is temiara, which can be analyzed as "person marker-patient marker-agent marker." The victim is "he or she who suffers someone else's action." 11. The word decomposes into -e'o-mam, whose suffix means "completely." E'o- appears to be a cognate of the Tembe he'o, which signifies "to be crazy," "to have fits" (epileptic, for example, Boudin 1966:59). Other possible cognates are teoa (death) and teoa (a faint) from the ancient Guarani (Montoya 1876), as well as te' me'e(dead thing), one of the terms for corpse in Arawete (Viveiros de Castro 1992:202). Common to these cognates is the idea of a loss of vital force or consciousness. 12. Western Parakana therapeutic practices depend on the capacity of dreamers to return with enemies capable of curing. There exists a kind of dream called "bringing in of the enemy" (akwawa-rero'awa), which is composed of two parts, each with a distinct state of reality. In the first, the dreamer's double goes to meet an enemy and asks the latter to come and cure him. After this, the dreamer "awakes," giving rise to the second part of the dream, which the Parakana conceive as wakeful state. The interaction shifts to one between the dreamer and the akwawa in their "true skins," and the cure is realized by the physical extraction of pathogenic agents. The dreamer can also bring the akwawa to cure another person, whether through the dream or summoning it through a song which he previously received from his familiar enemies (Fausto 1997:232-243). 13. For example, after a successful raid, two opetymo were performed. A first, small and brief, occurred soon after the raid, in which only the killers participated. Another, longer festival took place at the end of the killers' period of abstinence and seclusion. 14. I benefit here from Viveiros de Castro's (1 996c) insightful elaboration of the notion of perspective in Amerindian cosmologies (see also Lima 1996). Let me remark that whenever I speak of "spirits" or "subjective capacities," I do not imply disembodied subjectivity, nor a simple dichotomy between body and soul (see n. 7 above). For further discussion on this topic in the Amazonian context, see Viveiros de Castro (1996c:1 34-142). 15. In other Amerindian groups, the representation is reinforced through the use of masks. To take an example close to the Parakana, the Tapirape hold a mask festival, during which the anchunga spirits are said to inhabit the men's house. These spirits, normally harmful, are familiarized by the shamans, who bring them in oneiric experiences. Each spirit is associated with an animal or supernatural being and is represented by a pair of masked dancers. In the past, the most elaborate masks were those representing the spirit of enemies killed in battle (Wagley 1977:107-110). 16. The absence of predation in dreaming, therefore, is a preamble to the public execution of a jaguar, which is a substitute for an enemy. This complex echoes that of the 16th-century Tupinamba, who executed real jaguars as if they were enemies (Viveiros de Castro 1992:248). 1 7. Among the Asurini of the Tocantins (Andrade 1992), who speak the same language as the Parakan3, opetymo is formally a ritual of shamanic apprenticeship. The shaman-specialist administers the karowara (a source of curative power) to the initiates through the cigar. This act is conducive to a more fundamental experience, which is the transmission of karowara from the Jaguar to the future shaman through dreaming. The entire shamanic complex, represented in opetymo, sustains a strong correlation with the symbolic of warfare, since what is administered to the neophyte is a curative power which is, at the same time, a pure representation of cannibalism. The cigar used in the ritual is prepared by the shaman, who inserts within it small animal teeth, animated by his breath. One of the novice's possible reactions in inhaling the tobacco smoke is to be taken over by it rather than to be in control of the karowara. He then runs madly in search of raw flesh. This is why menstruating women cannot attend the festival. Enticed by the smell of blood, the novice would attack them (Andrade 1992:106). Not only the neophyte is transformed into an eater of raw flesh, since he who controls the karowara and dreams about the Jaguar becomes an homophagic par excellence. The Asurini opetymo, a ceremony initiating new shamans, is also a cannibal ritual. 18. Among the Western Parakana, all the rituals can be performed by women with an almost symmetrical inversion of the sexes (but not of gender, since the women play roles that are usually associated with maleness in Amazonia; four women have even collaborated in killing enemies with bows and arrows). These rituals, however, are much rarer than those executed by men. In contrast, the Eastern Parakan3 do not admit the possibility of this inversion. Although some women do give songs for men to kill in the ritual, women cannot perform the execution. It is thought that they should not enter into contact with potent external entities, or more precisely, should only do so through male mediation in the rituals. It is common for men to say that women should not dream, as they are particularly prone to sorcery. The symbolic substrate of this gender politics appears to be the conception that women already are, in themselves, beings who, like the killer, "smell of blood" (see Fausto 1997:276). Their acquisition of shamanic power would be a hyper-conjunction, an excess that would render them especially powerful and dangerous (which is why the dream activity of post-menopausal women is more readily admitted). 19. For a description of the latter, see Fausto (1997:273-275). Opetymo (the tobacco festival) and takwara-rero'awa (the flute festival) are juxtaposed almost term for term. The former is a rite of vocal music, danced individually and predominantly during the day, and associated with tobacco, sisters singing to brothers, the establishment of "friendship" relations (-paj6) between people of the same sex, and with warfare predation. The second is a festival of instrumental music, danced collectively and at night, and associated with honey, the brother's breast-feeding of the sister, the establishment of "friendship" relations (-paje) with people of the opposite sex, and with sexual predation. 20. I cannot elaborate here on the central significance in the rituals of the relations which Strathern (1988) denominates cross-sex (in opposition to same-sex relations). of enemies and pets 951</page><page sequence="20">21. In the Parakana case, there is always mediation through shamanism: the circuit has to pass through dream activity. This allows a greater autonomy in relation to real warfare, since the victims are songs that take the place of enemies. In the Tupinamba case, the cycle depended on an actual captive, but each ritual action (abduction, re-enemization, recapture, and execution) allowed a direct acquisition of names. On the other hand, the fattening period could result in new victims, since the children of captives were also executed. 22. A recurrent aspect of these rites is the elaboration of symbols of female fertility through men's ritual action, which can be interpreted as much as a representation of men's control over expanded social reproduction as a displaced affirmation of female reproductive power. In warfare rites, this contradiction is not veiled by secrecy, as is the case of men's initiation in Northwestern Amazonia (S. Hugh-Jones 1979) and in parts of New Guinea (Herdt 1994). As Levi-Strauss (1984:144-145) remarks, women played a central role in Amerindian warfare rites, occupying a mediating position in the process of familiarizing the enemy (as spouses and future mothers) and benefitting from the transference of the enemy's "life-force" (see Harner 1973:147; Sterpin 1993:42; Taylor 1993:673). 23. Similar motifs are found in the main Cinta-Larga ritual (see Dal Poz 1993:186-190). 24. Some fundamental themes of warfare rites can also be found in other Amazonian rituals that are not exclusively connected to warfare. In the Barasana initiation cycle, as analyzed by C. Hugh-Jones (1979) and S. Hugh-Jones (1979), for instance, four of these themes are present. First, there is the idea of a transmission of potency leading to the development of the participants' bodies and spirits; a potency that is transmitted from the dead ancestors to the living by shamanic mediation (and not from dead enemies to kin via warfare). Second, there is the conception that this transmission is an artificial process of male maturation, which makes the men active, fearless, and capable of violence, a process that is continually renewed. Third, this maturation takes place through the insertion of a corporeal liquid from the ancestors into the initiate-liquid comparable to menstrual blood (in place of the enemy's blood, which is also compared to menstrual blood). Fourth, the symbolism that makes initiation a kind of ritualized male menarche is conceived as a mode of male procreation equivalent and, at the same time, "superior" to female biological reproduction (C. Hugh-Jones 1979:142-153; see also n. 22). The comparison between modes of acquiring and transmitting "life-force" may be a bridge toward addressing some common problems in Amazonian and Melanesian ethnology, particularly those related to warfare, initiation, and ceremonial exchange (for comparisons within the latter region, see Knauft 1993; Lindenbaum 1984; Whitehead 1987). 25. This Karib group of the Middle Xingu performs a ritual called ieipari (trunk affine) in which the enemy is represented by a post on which is placed the skull of a war victim. At the height of the festival a pot of fermented drink is placed at the foot of the post for women to drink. In swallowing it, they say, "I'm drinking a child.... I drink a newborn" (Teixeira-Pinto 1997:128). 26. This appears to apply equally to symbolic anthropophagy, such as Arawete celestial cannibalism in which the gods (Mai) are defined as "eaters of raw meat," though they devour the dead after cooking them (Viveiros de Castro 1992:211, 256). 27. I follow Inwood (1992:283-284) who translates Aufhebung as "sublation." As he explains, Aufhe- bung has three main meanings in German: "raising up," "abolition," and "preservation." Hegel uses the concept in all three senses at once to convey the idea of a negation that is both suppressing and preserving and the outcome of which is a superior totality that contains both terms as moments. references cited Albert, Bruce 1985 Temps du sang, temps des cendres: Representation de la maladie, systeme rituel etespace politique chez les Yanomami du sud-est (Amazonie Bresilienne).
