Mimesis and methexis 1.1. The mimicry instinct "Semblance is part of nature; mimeticism alone is evidence enough. But it is only in man that resides the highest capacity for producing semblance. There are probably none of man's higher functions that are not in some decisive way affected by the mimetic faculty."1 If according to Benjamin "dance and language, gestures of the body and movements of the lips are primitive manifestations of mimesis/'2 then it follows that the original experience leading to any artistic activity dwells within mimesis. This activity concerns human cultures as a whole, given that all have created forms, whether artistic or technical?if these categories do in fact apply to such interwoven fields. Art and technique have long been considered as one in the West, confirming the etymology of the Latin word ars, an equivalent for the Greek word tekhn?. The evolutionist theory of Leroi-Gourhan thus calls for caution: "we might suppose that language and technique form an indispensable basis for survival. Upon this basis, aesthetic coloration developed little by little, independently in some ways, and at a later stage of evolution."3 If technique and language, words and tools, do in fact share the same origin, then producing a set of aesthetics is part of the same process of externalization inherent to the human species. It could be considered as the proof of man's will to transform reality into verbal or bodily symbols, and into material forms: a way of ordering nature's apparent chaos and regulating social life. Or then again it may be the expression of a need?better still, of a desire on the part of man to bring about his representation of the world and to make its dynamics his own, miming it through dancing, capturing it through works serving as marks or as projections and as sketches of life's magic rhythm into which his own image could then be embodied. Nevertheless, the act of giving shape does not make any sense unless these shapes or forms are considered as being deducted from their connection with nature, if that is indeed the true stimulating trigger for man's mimetic faculty. In this way, the history of forms seems deeply entwined with a history of mimesis. First of all, because such a history tells of forms passed between different groups this borrowing of forms is in itself a matter of imitation. The fact that mimeticism?in its technical aspects?evolves according to how skills improve has been proven by comparative technology: "one may borrow a language easier to handle or a less developed religion, but there is no swapping a cart for a hoe."4 This theory, which favors the idea of a cross-spreading of crafts, still does not solve the issue of the manifestations of the mimicry instinct. Whatever the context, each place that breeds a culture uses imitation, from prototype to its enfolding doubles. More generally speaking, we could say that to each culture its own language, customs, rituals, economics, agriculture, and aesthetics. Life itself is but forms: vegetable, human, or animal, so that each species may reproduce along its mimetic path as far as its essential viable features are concerned. Children's games everywhere are first and foremost about mimetic behavior. The genome is itself mimetic: it over-duplicates itself. 1.2 Imitation and tradition: Melanesian examples Mimetic proclivity is especially perceptible among traditional societies that are by definition prone to conforming. Tradition is transmission?in Gu?non's sense?of values constantly renewed by gesture, speech, and images. It is a transmission that begins with the ancestors, whose responsibility bears heavily upon the The text is a modified version of my master's thesis, "Style et standardisation des formes dans certains arts du Sepik," at the Department of Anthropology, University of Paris X-Nanterre, 2003.

A remarkable attribute of Melanesian societies resides in the fact that "within themselves they do not create values: they find them over again. There is never any founding of a new set of values but only a newly redone duplicating of values said to be primary because they remain unchanged and untouched."5 Melanesian forms, because they express the values of the groups that have produced them, are part of the same repetitive and mimetic scheme. In the Sepik, artistic labor is a collective enterprise so that it is impossible to speak of an individual style that could border on the values of the group. Of course, there as elsewhere, what is considered "fine" art is always that of gifted individuals. But one is not allowed to assign this work to a specific person?even though some studies, originating from an unfortunate tendency of regarding the Western artistic conception as the highest achievement, have sought such a pinpointing of talent. This idea is now predominant in places to which it was imported and spread by the urban milieus of postcolonial society, and by national institutions dating 5. R. Guidieri, La route des morts [The Road of the Dead] (Seuil, 1980), p. 63. The label qualifying archaic societies as conformist societies should encourage us to be cautious and must not lead to an underestimation of apparently superficial changes by paying too much attention to the canons of tradition. As it happens everywhere, change and the unforeseen occur. Conforming means that what is new and unrecognized is always appropriated and made to fit into rituals according to a canon. In aesthetic matters, in order to avoid certain misunderstandings, the notions of copying and innovating should always be evaluated within the limits of a given culture. This is what lead Alfred Gell in his study on the tattooed or sculpted works of the Marquesas Islands, beginning with the principle that the style at the core of ornamental arts cannot be understood through just one isolated form or by using every form available: no work is the same as any other even though differences, as in geometrical ornaments, more often come from the always renewed variations of the disposition of its fundamental elements than they do from a renewal of these elements themselves. Speaking of a model and of a copy is surely senseless. According to Gell, style can then be characterized by the whole set of relations that bind the works together, that is the field of the legitimate transformations thanks to which one motif may be shaped into another. This is what L?vi-Strauss had said about masks which, like myths, cannot be interpreted as distinct objects: if a myth, on a semantic level, does not acquire its meaning until it is put back into the group that keeps reshaping it, the same goes for a mask which, in a visual sense, responds to other masks?converting their colors and forms into new combinations. The originality of one style, if we understand it as such, is then what allows patterns to be generated through an infinite variation with other patterns, and it would account?according to those two authors?for the desire to translate and assert differences in rank, privileges of nobility, and different degrees of prestige within the frame of the highly hierarchic societies they have studied. from the time of Papua New Guinea's independence. Subsequently, there have been blatant forms of social disintegration so that even when "works showed the more local and personal orientation of their authors, they were often forcibly driven toward an end that meant to offer the country's elite and international diplomatic circles but an image of Papua New Guinea."6 If individual creativity exists and may be deemed precious (as with some Sepik social groups that favor competing and emulating artists), it still is a creativity that does not counter the canons or the value system to which the artist has submitted himself as a member of a group.7 What matters is for the collective nature of the artistic work done in the Sepik, both in terms of its means and ends, to translate a leveling of styles, a standardizing of forms. Margaret Mead has depicted the manner in which all the mountain Arapesh children would doodle away with pieces of coal on slates of bark. And what they drew was similar, though more schematic and less equivocal than the work of their elders done on large slates of bark adorning the house of ceremony. One may thus see how these individuals are, from a very young age, not only accustomed to the right handling but also to the visuals of what they roughly copy from the work of adults and which they themselves shall replicate after the proper initiation.8 Yet mimesis is not limited to what one individual may mimic from another. "The child does not just pretend to be a shopkeeper or a schoolteacher, but also pretends he is a windmill or a train."9 We must therefore proceed one step further into our understanding of the mimetic process. 1.3 Considerations based on Plato Of the history of mimesis, which is also inherent in Western aesthetics, we know of the bed story as told in Plato's tenth book of the Republic}0 The carpenter 6.

Medieval works of art were chiefly anonymous and it is only at a later date that it became usual to attribute this work to that artist whose name history had remembered. See among others, R. Guenon, Le R?gne de la quantit? et les Signes des Temps [The Reign of Quantity and the Signs of the Times] (Gallimard, 2000), p. 67. 8. M.

The carpenter's or the craftsman's bed is a copy of that reality. The painter's bed is but a copy of the carpenter's bed. It does not refer to the idea of the bed but only to the object it seeks to imitate. The painter is thus "twice-removed" from the concept of bed. He does a copy of another copy, a simulacrum that is rejected by Plato along with the other art forms of his time. Yet it is not so much the imitation process that is considered dangerous by the philosopher but its effects as materialized in the creations of an art that is not connected to what is real and true but based on an illusion?the paradigm for it being the technique of trompe-l'oeil painting. Not only is the problem of imitation that of the craftsman making a tool but also one finds in Plato the concept of an art proceeding from "good" mimesis, i.e. as tekhn?, such as Egyptian art which, instead of copying the appearance of things, brings about their reality and essence?the truth of their eidos. It is an iconic art in fact, since if we understand icon as the opposite of idol, then the icon does not fill in for its model but rather is what it is: a representation kept at the right ontological distance from the original. What we can see within Plato's use of mimesis is the beginning of a difference between, first, the art of deceiving illusions and, second, the art of the "carbon copy" that is true to the essence of things, that because it wants to reach the "true" picture?the Prototype?is the closest to a craftsman's reproduction. Hence, we must not understand mimesis as meaning only imitation. This narrow understanding of mimesis would mean a complete renunciation of any desire for what is inimitable. Yet the words are the same and cannot mean two absolutely different things. Benjamin, who always refused to view symbols as arbitrary, would speak in such a case of a "likeness other than sensitive." For instance we know that, for a long time, aviation sought to imitate the flight of birds. It failed, of course, until one day an engine was invented that had nothing in common with birds. Today's engineer seeks, finds, and relies on the hidden connections that make his one objective possible. In this sense, his manner is that of a sorcerer: from the same need for what is useful, which prompts this creation process, both engineer and sorcerer seek to capture the "infra-thin" energy existing among invisible forces and then proceed to produce the tool necessary to channel these energies.11 Magic and technique share a promptness to detect similarities that are only disparity and disorder to the eyes of common empirical knowledge.12 To comprehend these multiple uses of mimesis, it must be understood as the expression of the desire for a work to have a different relation to the idea with which it is connected. It is the notion of participation, methexis, which then enlightens the meaning of mimesis beyond any thought of imitation or representation.13 The saying "art imitates nature," the well-known slogan of realist art, could just as well be that of Breton's magic art. One needs only to think of the two meanings that the word "nature" possessed in the Middle Ages: natura naturans and natura naturata. Nature-as-creation denotes the creative energy within nature whereas nature-as-created designates all the reality that this energy has made manifest.14 The use of magic would then require the capture of some of this energy. The relation existing between methexis and mimesis is not dialectic. It is rather a question of a necessary and fundamental implication of methexis within mimesis: the facts of the world as tangible are?for Plato? emanations of ideas that they partake of and to which they are, in the end, subordinate. It comes down to considering a sort of submission or reliance of the thing to the idea, which draws a hierarchy from the abstract to the concrete and from the intangible to the tangible. From this point no work, be it artistic or technical, no 11. R. Guidieri's articles "Baits and Traps" and "An Art Without" in RES: Anthropology and Aesthetics, Autumn 1997, no. 32; Spring 2000, no. 41. 12. "The gap that separates these two ways of thinking, both just as intellectual and ambitious, which are non-western magic thought and scientific thought [is then not] what separates an analogous method from a nonanalogous method, but a discrepancy between two conceptions of causality, which opens different doors to the knowledge and effects of causality, that is of the thing itself." (Guidieri [see note 5], pp. 398-99). For scientific thought rooted in Aristotle, to know the cause is to know the essence of the thing, to reach the heart of the thing. Magic thinking uses the chain of causes and effects in a different way. It does not seek definition but uses its magic evocation of the thing to find new causations, causes leading to other things, rejecting causality as understood by experimental intelligence. The motto of magic could be: "There are?there must be?an analogy between the umbrella and the vivisection table." (Ibid., p. 401). It is important to notice that seeking essence through definition, that is finding to what each thing is identical, may not be possible unless through an analogous confrontation with something else. This is obvious if one admits the difference between noetic and eidetic, in a context of pure sensibility. That's why, to use Wittgenstein's phrase, it is not so much magic which is a special kind of causation, but every causality which is magic; or rather, that any analogy?mimesis?is magic. 13.

Thus the relation of the tool to its model is a mimetic one in the sense that once the idea becomes a principle, the craftsman is confronted with the materials he has in order to materialize (imitate) the idea into an object. Hence the example of the bed maker. The mimetic process for the artist that paints the bed implies, on the contrary, a manipulation of this hierarchy, whereby a leveling occurs in which truth and illusion are no longer competing concepts. Nevertheless, as I have said before, these two ways are not so different and in any case the result, more or less mimetike, is not so much an absurd equation that equals the thing and the idea than it is an equally absurd promotion of what is false?as may be noticed at both ends: for us a generalized aestheticism seemingly capable of encompassing everything; and according to archaic thought, the simulacrum, the ploy that makes visible what otherwise would never be so. The nature of the relation of the idea to the thing in terms of it affecting language is quite a different one, and obviously cannot be resolved within the frame of the signifier/signified equation. There is a third element: the thing itself, which is neither reference nor meaning.15 Aristotle describes the relation of Plato's idea to its multiple manifestations as follows: "according to how they partake, the quantity of synonyms is homonymous with the Ideas they relate to." Thus single horses are synonymous with the concept of "horse," but homonymous with the idea of horse. As with Russel's paradox, the same object belongs and does not belong to a class.16 What then is the idea of the horse? Neither an object nor a concept but "its own name-bearing, its own belonging or its being-within-language."17This would be beneficial because of the positive achievement that transforms one into the other so that "Plato's tautology [. . .] still remains to be thought: the idea of the thing is the thing itself, the name, as it names a thing, is but the thing as it is named by the name." In other words, if the name used to express the thing is the thing itself, then the name cannot express the thing. And if speech is unable to capture the essence of a thing from tangible reality using the conventional word for it, naming allows?not the perception of this essence?but its "conception": in Plato's theory of ideas, this knowledge is a remembering?"perception returning to its original memory"?made possible by how names partake of things and ideas.19 That the idea of the thing is the thing itself remains somewhat of a paradox if we are to understand this as qualifying the relation between the idea and the thing as one of identity. It is more a matter of ipseity?the thing itself, transcended into the idea, into its being-within language. "The existence of the idea [would then be] a paradigmatic existence: the fact of it standing-alongside each-thing (para-deigma). But this standing-alongside [would suppose] a restriction, or fringing, with vacillating boundaries: a halo."20 1.4 About prototype If the Sepik area shows signs of a great variety of forms, each cultural group draws from a rather thin stock of forms relating to rituals and traditional ways of thinking, which only the passing of time has been able to bend and alter, before the coming of the white people. What is noticeable is that the opposition between model and copy is mainly a matter of concepts and has little palpable bearing on the lives of these societies. Moreover, however true this assessment may be that every artistic tradition relies on imitation? which, in one way or another refers to an origin?the knowledge we have of the Oceanian world and of its forms has come too late and is still too uncertain for us to hope to reach any such point of origin. However, if memory does dwell inside the core of any kind of image, be it archaic or not, the quest for origin is no doubt unfathomable since there can be no given starting point for the field of memory. 15.

R?ssel studied in 1901 what could be the class of all classes, which would not belong to any class. If A is such a class, then obviously A belongs to A if and only if A does not belong to A. This contradiction led R?ssel to adopt a restrictive theory of classes so that "no class ever belongs to itself," although our understanding of classes would have us think that such a class is possible. 17.

A deductive conception of the relationship between copy and model is not only vain but untrue. The movement is in fact just the opposite: what happens is a continuous induction of the model from its every copy. What Alfred Gell said of style is also true of models. Style is "the least difference" which makes the difference between an object and another. Each copy bears the marks of a difference and all together they refer to one another and amount to the idea, which is the model or the prototype. It is actually essential that the model be only the idea of the model: this is "what allows it," says Baudrillard, "to be everywhere within each comparative difference and to thus subsume the whole series."21 Once again, we arrive at Russel's paradox. And this paradox can establish the leverage necessary to achieve representation. If the model? canon or convention alike?is the generic ?mage obtained through the imaginary assumption of all relative differences, then the fascination it entails has the power to foster the series that keeps denying itself as serial, difference per difference. Hence, the "consumer" may only put his hands on a succession of fragments each deprived of the quality seen in the whole (but which may be acquired in the special case of belief). If the model then goes from canon to convention?a modern absurdity but a real enough illusion: any show can testify to this?then everything changes. A canon serves as a legitimating principle for a world and social order, whereas convention implies only a renewed acquisition of other ways within that world and, as such, is indefinitely replaceable. It is the nature of fetishism itself as applied to marketed products that is doubly at work: the supremacy of "things supra-sensitive and yet tangible which is accomplished by representation, the tangible world being replaced by a collection of images that exist above, and which at the same time are accepted as what is most visibly tangible."22 Roberto Calasso is right to compare the opposition between what is modern and what is archaic with the opposition between "producing" and "re-producing." "To reproduce is the verb used in a world ruled by canon."23 It directs all traditional societies whose rites, according to Gu?non's interpretation of etymology, have the sole purpose of achieving what is ordered?to reproduce an order, the order of the rta (ordo) that rules both cosmos and society. When this is no longer possible, when what is new can no longer be absorbed and translated through that order, then culture declines. "To produce is the verb used in a world ruled by domination, where it is essential to enjoy the fictitious workings of a process that, as it proceeds, means an addition of power."24 Any show relies on this fiction: its means are at the same time its goals. There is no order in that world, but the rule of quantity, an indefinite multiplication as the fake remedy to the absence of a real model; a vast pulsating and extending nebula. The relation between model and copy is at least as complex with traditional societies. What follows mainly deals with effigies that are not icons and therefore do not strive for the "true" image: the prototype. Let's consider all the objects involved in cults that may be characterized as idols?small statues, sculpted posts, masks?that are numerous in Melanesia and especially in the Sepik area. The effigies in question are forms that embody what otherwise would remain invisible or absent. In the Sepik these are ancestors or totemic spirits. Guidieri considers these effigies mainly as "simulacra" or "copies-of-copies."25 If he suggests the possibility that these items are never only a surface but require volume, it may be that the same is true of ?cons, which have, as far as I may assert, always favored and used graphics. Volume, as a container, is perhaps too likely to embody a presence and thus may be inadequate, and even dangerous, for an art form that does not want to be idolatrous.26 Here we can see a new difficulty arise. The classic understanding of the icon assumes that there is one specific and unique entity, close to Christian tradition; which is to say an "incomparable prototype against other so-called prototypes. This means, according to the monotheistic principle, that there can be only one prototype."27 Yet effigy-idols and the innumerable ones the inhabitants of the Sepik area have made refer to as many prototypes as there are forms. This is because in the end 21. J. Baudrillard, Le syst?me des objets [System of Objects] (Gallimard, 1968), p. 201. 22. G.

In this way, our knowledge of antique religions, beginning with prehistory, always reduces the non-western theophanic manifestations to a monotheistic model."28 Finally, the dialectics of the double/prototype equation are brought to an end with the analogy between captured entity?the ancestor?and the object used to receive it. We must nevertheless notice that, however human it may be, and in spite of its frequent anthropological applications, ancestry is an abstraction?a "class"?and as such cannot be equated with an actual object. We may presume that its major attribute?its absence?ensures its persistence.29 In other words, an effigy is both something hidden deep in the presence of the ancestor and something present and detectable through the very absence and obscurity of ancestry. The effigy is a disrupted unity in and of itself, which makes it a fragmented piece, the ruin of a symbol. It does not claim to be identical to a prototype but rather an extension of the same, from concept to the finished object: the idea of the thing is "the thing itself." What remains unanswered is the question of the pictorial form, obviously less arbitrary. In the Sepik, giving and making shapes or forms depends on a limited number of forms recognized as potent and approved by tradition?objects that exist already or that belong to inner representations connected with our memories of pictures. It is also closely connected to the collective nature of the artistic work, itself a repeated imitation. To sum up what can be said of effigies: it is as if "the will to imitate, which triggers figurative representation, implied this particular belief according to which not only does the imitation of forms produce objects, but the connection thus established between ?mitating-object and imitated-entity causes their symbiosis."30 Something false-true then: a simulacrum. 2. Echoes of form and content It may, when it awakes or when it awakes us, represent the object in a shining formal aura; it is with its content that it deals with, with its elementary matter, the yet undetermined absence of form.31 What has been most commented on in L?vy-Bruhl's writings is his theory of the pre-logic mentality of primitive societies, using this as an example of what should never be done in ethnology. At the end of his life, he gave up this idea in favor of the notion of participation?methexis?which he no longer considered as a logical way of thinking, "since despite the obvious, there is no law nor principle of participation."32 To L?vy-Bruhl methexis legitimates mimesis and quenches our thirst for explanations because it is definite. There is nothing there, once the myth has spoken. In defining methexis as a necessary condition, "not as a cause, but as co-substantial, as an essence communicated and shared," L?vy-Bruhl also asked us to attempt an actual "erotics" of the image.33 If there has been previous mention of a mimesis spontaneously directed toward participation, it is not only so for phenomenological reasons. Methexis is also, and mainly, a condition that creates a pulse, an echo in the silence that forms call their own and that the Sepik's inhabitants know how to preserve. This pulse is the result of a tension between mimesis and methexis combining shape and content. The shape "fits the idea" (Mallarm?) which subsequently fits the shape. And such a content has no unity but is disrupted; at stake are various segments that influence each other and reciprocate as they join, much as bodies do according to Freud's description of the fusion of erogenous zones. Is not the imagination so very close to the fragmented body as a source of fantasies? Delightful gardens and archaic dreams, forever entwined in the haunted pictures of Hieronymus Bosch. Each part of art participates with this strewn condition or zoning?not for lack of completion of different art forms but rather because of the excessive profusion of the original boundaries that generate these echoes. Art is plural for the muse, said Benjamin; the opposite is just as true, and there are many echoes between mimesis and methexis. It is one of the reasons why each time a shape appears it may be read in different ways. This is also why iconology may be interpreted as a variation of forms around the same meaning, as a variation of meanings around the same form. In this regard, the inhabitants of the Sepik, who knew how fragile shapes and their contents could be, are effective in breaking the stylistic barriers that were put up on their land. It is acknowledged that everything is precarious and hazy, a 28. Ibid. 29. Guidieri (see note 5), p. 114. 30. Ibid., pp. 177-178. 31. M.

Nonetheless, semiotics have their own limitations. "The starting point of these hermeneutics," Guidieri noted, "indulges in the confusion between object and speech. In this semiological reduction, material events become 'legible' as facts of speech."36 We have to admit the temptation is great when speaking of forms, and especially tangible ones. About effigies, it is nevertheless impossible to be so easily confused when faced with the object and the entity it comprises. It would also mean admitting an "initial shattering that has nothing to do with usefulness, even if understood through the symbolic expression of communicating or participating."37 These pages began with mimetic instinct?Breton, on the other hand, draws conclusions as to a theory of "magic fear," an attractive theory in many ways but one impossible to verify. In what follows, the object shall, for a time, disappear as if it were sinking under the meaning the ethnologist wants to give it. Such is the case with the studies of Anthony Forge on Abelam art, which begin with the following hypothesis: "Art is not about things, but about relationships."38 The care that the Abelam people show is not so much to represent such or such character or animal, but to establish permanent types of relationships. The digression concerning structuralism is quite a useful one. If we are to understand the cultural signification of any work, we cannot limit ourselves to a mechanic conception of art and broach this subject only through the prism of formal qualities. The artwork may be described as an "integration," which preserves its own nature, that is formal. "Obviously, bearing such a contradiction and being borne by it, art remains this self-reliant universe, as art for art's sake would have us believe, although really because life for art's sake and art for life's sake is its right interpretation."39 What matters according to a structuralist point of view is not knowing what shape, size or form a work will manifest; it does not question the work as such but as a document (only to then speak of it as a work of art). Its objective is to infer, through Sepik arts, certain underlying social conventions. This implies that one must set it against a local perspective, within other manners of social activity, inside the walls of the specific cultural context of the Sepik. With different architectural designs, partly connected to their environments, the latmul and Abelam men's houses have this in common: their interior is always a secret and sacred space, where the items used during ritual are forbidden to the eyes of both women and the initiates. Men constitute the social and geographic core of the community and have the privilege of looking at the central position of these houses of ceremony. Women have their place on the periphery and are scattered due to the space-partition between places occupied by men grouped in agnatic order. According to Forge, the Abelam men's house is not just a decorated construction used for ceremonies and the display of objects for initiation rituals, it is also a translation of Abelam culture in architectural terms, an example of which could be, through words, the transmission of myths. If, as legend has it, women discovered the initiation rituals, these are strictly forbidden to them. The secret surrounding the items used?masks, drums, Abelam yams or latmul flutes? that are gradually revealed to the young as they go through initiation, has been "stolen" from women by men. The relationships between men and women are emblematic of Sepik cultures, and vary from one society to the next throughout Melanesia. Initiation of men consists of a long cycle aimed at ridding oneself of everything impure and feminine from whence men came, in order to acquire a masculine identity, always uncertain and precarious: only ancestry may achieve this. Paradoxically, acquiring a masculine identity is only possible through a process stating its difference from the 34. J.-F.

The sexual encounter is not merely symbolic but first of all biologic. Masculinity cannot be completely divided from its archetype? woman. As impure as she may be, she is the condition of procreation, indispensible to the community. So as to free themselves from this hold and submission, men use ritualistic means. Thus the tambaran, which creates a new living space that goes beyond death and which excludes women?a reference, used to assert man's difference. In his postscript to Naven, Gregory Bateson indicates that the latmul men's house bears the same name as the female sex. Likewise, Forge notices that the Abelam men's house is thought of as female.40 Dark and secret, the inside of the house?which the Abelam and latmul both call the "belly," holds sculptures of men, mainly masculine effigies of ngwalndu, ancestral figures displayed at each level of the Abelam initiation process. Since these are precious initiation secrets, these societies are very difficult to study. Other obstacles are to be considered. Forge, for instance, had suggested to the Abelam that the tip of the mangandu sculpture?called dama, the "nose"?could represent a penis. Such a hypothesis was immediately rejected by the Abelam, but he persisted and added that the basket attached to and hanging from a piece of rope bore an obvious likeness to testicles. To this observation, the Abelam replied that it was just a name. This anecdote illustrates the general attitude of the Abelam regarding their own creations: if the motif and the elements all have names, this remains the only level of understanding they agree to verbalize. It is not certain that their refusal was motivated by the sexual nature of the comment. "It seems rather," says Bateson, "that a strict focus, limited to a unique group of related elements, for them goes counter to the more profound significance of the work of art."41 If it "only had to do with sex or social organization, [it] would be commonplace. It is uncommon and profound, precisely because it relates to sex and social status, [. . .] and other things as well. In short, the [work of art] refers to a type of relationship and not to one individual related element."42 If in a given situation, a motif or image is used for one of the things they mean, all others still remain in the background. In such ambivalence dwells the essential nature of their effectiveness during ritual. Regrettably, Forge did not attempt a parallel with the nominal structure, characteristic of Papua languages. It would have been useful to know whether the auxiliary verb "to be" was part of the Abelam language, the situation of the noun phrase being therefore modified.43 Knowing that a noun phrase "does not express a fact or data, but establishes a timeless and permanent relation that is authoritative," would constitute a sketchy explanation of the absence of exegesis by the Abelam concerning their motifs.44 The phallic symbol could refer to various aspects of male ideology: warlike aggressiveness and violence, procreation and fertility. If Forge's hypotheses are not as clear as he would have us think, his analysis of symbolism in Abelam painting on slates, displayed in triangular arrangements, like the disposition of the front of the house of ceremony, are useful.45 These slates are made from the sheaves of palm-tree leaves woven together and attached to a bamboo frame. The Abelam arrange these either inside the men's house for the purpose of initiation, or outside as additional ornament, most often tied to the two main posts. A recurring motif throughout their painting is a pointy oval, in red, yellow, white, or black, representing the woman's belly. This motif is also around the painted figures of ngwalndu? the main spirits in male rituals. In spite of their authors' denials, the image of ancestral spirits in capsules inside the pointy oval motif is quite telling. If men claim to be superior to women, it is tempting to interpret this as a strange confession of their lack of power: it is as if feminine power, superior because it is natural, according to the very words of the Abelam, were incomparable to theirs which elaborates on belief. The ex-centric position of women tells us that without them the masculine center would not exist. Feminine Modulor.46 This is a singular use of mimesis bearing methexis in its body. Paintings on slates would then express the creative superiority of women, which men make their own through the process of ritual. Echoing the zoning 40. A.

A fact common to many societies in the Sepik is the formation, by men, of a knowledge copied from the power of women. This knowledge imitates, on a ritual level, the prototype act of procreation belonging to women: the ability to give life. This wondrous enigma?man coming out of a woman's body?seems to be at the origin of man's main ritual initiation or social activity. Among the latmul, the initiators are clearly identified with the mothers of the novices. Likewise, the crocodile jaws used as an entry to the initiation circle are called tshuwi iamba, literally "clitoris door,"47 the strange entry "into the antique native land of the little man, where each man has once lived."48 Not only is this symbolism endowed with specific sexual signification, constantly using the opposition of the two sexes, but the union of the sexes could very well be, in Melanesia "the archetypal figure where all actions include their entwined opposite."49 Breton, strongly influenced by Freud's theory, considered that symbolism itself, "as a cryptic expression of fear and rituals" was historically of sexual origin: "the discovery, terrifying and fascinating for man, of his own dual nature (through nightmare, nocturnal erection and his sudden awaking, a revelation that precedes the realization that there are shadows and reflections) has caused this unbalance that is present before any socially organized sexuality."50 Forge saw Abelam sculptures as fecundity or hunting idols. No doubt Breton would have seen these as apotropaic images linked to a deeper sexual background, trying to "counter horror, and prolong its ecstatic feeling."51 Now reaching the end of this first incursion into Sepik art, it is important to assert that art is not so much a way of expressing the values of a given culture as much as it is the means of expression of the dominant ideology, the male one. While many cultures share this characteristic feature, what is specific to Melanesian culture is that it rests on the tautological assertion "whose emphasis indicates that it's doubtful: which is that opposites attracting, the meeting of two highly differentiated notions, is productive."52 Melanesian art intends to stress the ritual potency of masculinity, which, though it may be copied from femininity, needs to impose its radical difference and superiority in order to express itself. But even with this in mind, the question of form remains unanswered. Stating that signs are arbitrary, structuralism is of no help either. As with linguistics, structuralism applied to form cannot deal with this issue without discarding the thing itself. It thinks it does not, levelling sign and form. "Does this mean that form is empty, that it is a wandering number looking for the figure that escapes it?"53 Certainly not. Form makes sense, which is form itself, and must not be mistaken for the meanings attributed to it: "the sign signifies, whereas form signifies itself."54 By equating sign and form, the conventional distinction between form and content is implicitly left unquestioned. But a form's content is first of all a formal content. Only afterwards may we speak of it as sign or symbol. If this is not taken into account, then we neglect what Panofsky already blamed W?lfflin for: forms created, "using their inherent dynamics, overflow into content."55 As mimesis contains methexis, shape or form and content are not independent but mutually opposed. 2.2 Toward a psychology of form Primitive art has often been considered as a link between two conflicting trends, a geometrical and a naturalistic one. This theory is based on the idea that art's historical development within a given culture begins with sketchy or geometrical forms and ends with naturalistic ones. In his Spatr?mische Kunstindustrie (1901), the art historian Alois Riegl rejects this positivist theory as yet another type of iconoclasm, by showing how Roman arts of the late Empire period should not be viewed as declining but as establishing new standards and the birth of a new paradigm. The false absence of know-how among late antique works merely expresses a different "Kunstwollen," a different "artistic will." Previously, in Stilfragen?Questions of Style (1893), he had been interested in the evolution of motifs, especially vegetal ones, in the ornaments of antiquity. This study 47.

In this way, it renders obsolete all previous theories that saw in vegetal design a merely blunt imitation of nature. We now know the famous case of the acanthus leaf, regarded until then as the faithful imitation of the plant's leaf: but "no one seems to have noticed how unbelievable such an origin would be, that would suppose one had simply picked the first weed available and promoted it to the level of artistic pattern."56 The process is quite the other way around: the geometrical ornament has been naturalized afterward. As Focillon has put it, even if an ornament had first been a sign, in the world of form it produces a whole series of designs now unrelated to their origin. Particularly since "in such a field, it is not impossible to assimilate style and stylistics" since ornamental style exists and thinks of itself along the lines of the development of its inner logic, of a dialectic that cannot make sense outside itself. Its variations do not depend on the invasion of additional foreign items, of contingent choices, but on its secret set of rules."57 This should guard us from the temptation of wanting to find mutual influences between ornamental styles of neighboring cultures, even if they may use the same patterns. Wilhelm Worringer, in his 1907 book Abstraction and Einf?hlung, pushes Riegl's findings further and more radically. According to him an object from nature is never afterward stylized, whatever the ornamental pattern. There is "no stylization but naturalization. The prime element is not the natural model but a ruling abstraction" that it contains and makes possible.58 Whether the ornament is vegetal or linear, it always represents an abstraction, despite the fact that for the first one the model may have been from nature. The difference is only one of degree, and the manner is similar, which goes along with the idea that everything depends on the exact implication of methexis within mimesis, if we understand mimesis as something more than mere imitation, as has been advocated above. On this subject, Worringer is the best reference. By radically allowing an actual aesthetic purpose to geometrical stylization, he legitimates abstraction as a means of artistic expression. Worringer's theory is as follows: assuming there are two opposed tendencies, abstraction and Einf?hlung, between these two extremes in different degrees lies the same need for an "abandonment from one's self," ultimately essential to any aesthetic experience.59 The premise of each of these two tendencies may, according to him, be inferred from "humanity's psychic state when faced with the cosmos, in view of the phenomena man observes in the outside world."60 Born from his anxiety toward the world, the need for abstraction would bring forth forms that could slightly weaken reality and could accordingly bend such a reality into an abstract order. On the contrary, Einf?hlung?empathy?would translate man's congenial relationship with outside cosmic phenomena and produce naturalism.61 If Worringer must be commended for having conceived of an "abstract legitimacy" in his own time, we still notice that the notion of progress is the backbone of his thinking: art, in his view, inevitably leans toward an "organic legitimacy." The symmetry that he establishes between these two conceptions of the world-image?a trusting one that leads to naturalism and an anxious one that uses abstraction as a means to keep an unchecked nature at a distance?could and should be amended. Abstraction and restraint probably have something in common. Thought, when it steps back from the world's complexity, is by itself partial to abstracting concepts and breaking down life's continuous flux. To abstract, etymology has it, means to isolate through thinking, to separate a part of something from a whole. "This would quite perfectly match the first occurrences of prehistoric art, which proceeds through a selection of expressive points?phallus, vulva, buffalo or the head of a horse? and then assembles these as symbols to present a complete mythological picture, to constitute a mythogram."62 In saying that abstraction needs a measure of concentration, of condensation, there is the possibility of wrongly taking a logical connection for a necessary one. As Breton points out, this hypothesis does not sufficiently take into account the charm contained for the magician-artist in "images, shadows, reflections, dreams, and always in the eyes' pupils."63 I share Meyer Shapiro's opinion that the essential opposition is not between naturalistic and geometric 56.

Breton (see note 14), p. 122.</page><page sequence="11">Chambrin: Style and standardization in some arts of the Sepik 163 styles, but between different kinds of compositions that use both naturalistic and geometric patterns.64 In the Sepik, abstract and naturalistic elements reach a kind of balance. It is also possible to imagine that they belong to different historical layers, knowing that abstraction corresponds, for Worringer, to the first aesthetic manifestations. Some ten years after his thesis was published, the discovery of parietal figurative art from the Palaeolithic complicated his position. Leroi-Gourhan settled the question by saying that Palaeolithic realism, connected to religious or mythical purposes, only represents a very late stage of the period, from 11,000 to 8,000 years b.c., and its actual early stages would only be around 30,000 years B.c. The evolutionist theory would then confirm that abstraction came first. It is difficult to accept that if prehistoric parietal painting is abstract at first, it is not until the invention of photography and with modern abstract painting that we have rediscovered it all. It is as if humanity, after its historic parenthesis, were to once again find the way to its evolution and its own genesis?that of a nonmimetic homo faber.65 In the Sepik, Forge notices that Abelam pictorial art comprehends coexisting figurative and abstract patterns, and suggests that at an earlier time, painting was probably less figurative. Thus, the objects that have best defied time would not bear anthropomorphic or zoomorphic marks. Such is the case it seems with some engraved bone-daggers whose designs resemble the abstract ones of the ngwalndu spirits as seen on the fronts of men's houses.66 However, Sepik art, though it may propose plenty of abstract or geometrical designs, is not uninterested in anthropomorphic or zoomorphic motifs. Concerning the latter, one should obviously not speak of naturalism as Western art understands it during Antiquity or the Renaissance. Western art cares very little for the faithful imitation of natural forms. It is much more concerned with an attempt to "best correspond to an organic and life-like truth [. . .] because the feeling of the beauty of actual organic and life-like forms had previously emerged"67 The criterion of the organic is not the illusion of liveliness, but the harmonic, the balanced, which is in accord with the vital feelings of our organism. With Sepik art forms, it would be na?ve to think in terms of "contentment" regarding organic lively forms. This concept is far too full of undertones to be effective in our description, even inadequate in speaking of the figures of anthropomorphic ancestry, which are much more than doubles of dead bodies. It is then best to use the word "naturalistic" as a tool for description, in a restricted sense, as meaning that which is close to natural forms. The notion of a true image, as we have seen before, makes no sense for a non-iconic art. Can we then think in terms of a tendency for Einf?hlung in order to justify Sepik anthropomorphic forms? Sepik and Melanesian art, in general, do not look for subjects in the creation of the world nor in the deeds of gods?as it happens in Polynesia, and in particular in Hawaii or among the Maori?but look instead to the foundations of their social life. These foundations have been progressively established by the ancestors, personified or deified in a certain way, but detached from the world of the living, which, through an uninterrupted chain of generations, descends from them. If there is an Einf?hlung at work, it can only be located along the narrow line that allows ancestors to be the removed relatives of today's people. Still, the proportions of anthropomorphic figures are rarely realistic, and human or animal figures seem to be only used in abstract patterns. If the various travelers that have gone through Sepik country during the twentieth century have testified 64. M. Shapiro, "La Notion de style" [The Notion of Style], ?n Style, artiste et soci?t? [Style, Artist and Society] (Gallimard, 1999), p. 60. 65. Since Russian Suprematism, the history of form as a history of mimesis has probably reached its end. Malevitch's program stated: "To create a world, beyond the zero-degree of forms." The painters Malevitch and Rodchenko seem to disappear beyond the paradoxical experience of looking at what is exhibited. One experiences the limit, the perception-threshold one mysteriously oversteps because we see what we cannot. The concept of "last painting" means specifically to go beyond and outside history, teleology, and the need to assign meaning. The best proof of this is that there is really no need to even see paintings: it is enough to know they exist. This negative dialectic, in some ways close to Adorno, which attempts to reach an ending of the history of forms, to give back to art its "historical" chance, is perhaps Utopian. But it still requires that aesthetics and philosophy give up their quest for meaning and renounce traditional hermeneutics as the main form of access to a previous signifying reality. The history of forms as mimesis, which ends with Suprematism, does not open onto something else. One must mourn one's reason, for the image is condemned to be eternally hermetic, and the immanence attached to this enigma indicates that phenomenology is no longer possible. The image-enigma is, at the same time, what makes possible a form of thinking that can withstand such an unresolved concept. Its power lies in its ability to bring man beyond his theories of representation and history. Hence, the political meaning and use of the image. Still, if photography has allowed for a new link with the prehistoric nature of the image-enigma, is has also expanded to such a degree that it no longer stands as an image. This great era of photographic invasion may be what we will all soon sink under, but "where lies danger also grows salvation" (H?lderlin). 66. A. Forge, "Style and Meaning in Sepik Art," (see note 40), p. 178. 67. Worringer (see note 58), p. 62.</page><page sequence="12">164 RES 47 SPRING 2005 to the presence of naturalistic forms, we must not underestimate the impact of Western pictures on these societies.68 The absence of faithful representations of the human body could also be explained by what Breton calls the universal fear of "magic appropriation of reflection."69 Such a hypothesis echoes the abstract tendency that Worringer says belongs to the underlying feeling of anxiety toward images of the world. There is one exception: the sculpting of human skulls, which is done by many Sepik groups. It may be performed on hunting trophies captured from war victims, or on the funeral relics destined to help the deceased come into his position as an ancestor. The technique of skull sculpting is the most naturalistic one in the Sepik. At least for human skulls that are to be used as relics, it aims at the best possible imitation of the features of the "prototype"?the face of the person destined to ancestral life. Yet the eyes are almost always hidden under stylized ornaments. The sockets are filled and most often decorated with seeds or shells. Apotropaic ?mages? In spite of their own naturalistic design, the faces are blind. Just as some tales tell of artists who hesitated to apply the last stroke of the brush to their painting for fear that the picture would suddenly come alive, this could be seen as the consequence of the analogous belief in the potency of the powers of Pygmalion. Might this be a way to handle skulls less dangerously? If in Worringer's terms the tendency for abstraction is born of a preoccupation for nature's confusing order, there is no doubt that this feeling is widespread among Sepik societies and could be considered as one of the first impulses necessary for the creation of forms. Primitive man wanted to "take this single thing away from the outside world's arbitrary apparent contingency and make it eternal by relating it to abstract designs, and therefore obtain a holding point in the midst of such fluctuating manifestations."70 Such a hypothesis is quite possibly correct and could reasonably be applied to ornamental and geometrical designs as conceived in the Sepik. Along similar lines we could consider masks as standardization of the face of death, and then of the face of the ancestors. A false relic in a way, different from sculpted skulls, and the fake double of a model destined to fade away. Melanesian thought is more intent on attributing a ritualistic meaning to any element from the natural surroundings than it is to elements connected to man. Of course, physis comprehends the Sepik socius. It is pleonastic to assert this premodern hierarchy. But if Sepik societies necessarily follow natural phenomena, it is ancestry which is causa prima and causa sui. It overcomes the fear of nature's disorder that springs up everywhere from physis. Nature is an abyss, a void (Heidegger) that magic and religious conscience will question: it looks for laws and reliable markings, and by applying a cosmic order?a mimetic one?onto natural chaos, it achieves its goal. Thus the world as it is seen becomes the representation of the works of the founding ancestors as with the latmul or Sawos people of the Middle-Sepik. For the Abelam, ngwalndu-puti, the highest manifestation of the great ancestor, is the "void" (puti) from whence all life came: humans, pigs, yams, cassowary?still present as embodied in the house of ancestry.71 It must be noted that any construction, any collection from the world is violence done to nature and breaks up its primal unity, and so necessitates acts?fictions?to reciprocate this. The elaboration of the men's house in the Sepik implies that at each stage of the construction, a whole series of liturgical acts, of taboos and purification rituals must be obeyed.72 For the warrior societies of the Sepik, any inauguration of a new house of ceremony is celebrated by a hunt for heads, necessary for the community's prosperity. But is it not rather the enactment of a fiction for the benefit of ancestry? A way of bridging the gap caused by the first action of taking from the yet uninhabited earth? Is not ngwalndu-puti itself the "void" because it has given everything? For Joseph Rykwert the templum, as image of the world of the dead, and the first killing, as origin of cosmic order that the cult of the dead merely reenacts, are closely connected in archaic myths.73 Likewise, it was clear to 68. A study of the massive changes in Melanesian society as a result of the sole introduction of foreign images would no doubt be very valuable. 69. Breton (see note 14), p. 114. 70. Worringer (see note 58), p. 53.

It is difficult to presume there is a link there with the cult of the ancestors.75 Such is the hypothesis formulated by Schmitz and B?hler who think that hunting for heads and partaking in ceremonial meals where pork meat was used instead of prisoners, are substitutes to the killings that used to take place in the Sepik to honor the ancestors.76 This interpretation would not be contradicted by the various myths in the northern part of New Guinea, myths that tell of the creation of the world by the twin sons of Mother-Earth who, by killing the anthropophagous giant who came from the male celestial principle, gave birth to present-day life.77 In a world born of a feminine victory, human sacrifices and cannibalism would then be deeply rooted in man, as if to perpetuate the killing of the giant and his manducation at the dawn of time and what resulted from it?hunting for heads and celebrating ancestors, all means for conquering masculine identity. Indeterminacy itself, that is death, is never natural in the Sepik, but to be imputed to enemy powers that are owed what revenge will regain. For the latmul, the death of one of their own always means that an avenging and retributive hunt for heads is looming. These remarks are meant to insist on the fact that natural indeterminacy is indeed a threat, which might corrupt what must remain untouched, a gap to be filled by the use of liturgy. All uncertainty is mirrored in an order that ancestry ensures.78 Concerning forms themselves, this fear corresponds? in Worringer's words?to "a spiritual anxiety toward space."79 It would then demand a measure of repression on the part of spatial presentation. "Space does indeed connect things to each other and renders them relative in the world's image. [. . .] As a tangible object still depends on space, it cannot appear to us as individually and materially complete and shut," which is what the need for abstraction achieves.80 Abelam painting on triangular slates fulfils this condition perfectly: absence of depth, abstract rigid designs, linear and curvilinear ornamentation?all these are prerequisites to a striving for abstraction as Worringer stipulates it?are hereby perfectly met. Nevertheless, his conclusions concerning Sepik statues seem first of all inadequate. Worringer has it that "space that connects things, which abolishes their individual boundaries, space in the sense of air and atmosphere, is just what gives things a place in time, and what pulls them into repeated cosmic combinations of phenomena."81 Hence the need for sculpture to achieve a tactile closure regarding its material, and to brand tectonic values onto forms, which amounts to canceling what free space may be left by enclosing it "as it were within a tectonic legality within which their own lives will be stifled."82 In a certain way, this could be true of Polynesian and Micronesian art, if we think of the sculptures on Nukuoro in the Caroline Islands, since nearly nowhere else in Oceania has there ever been such care shown to the making of geometrical volumes. Polynesian or Micronesian art works were also meant to last, which agrees with Worringer's comments. But in general such is not the case with Melanesian art. The use of soft or organic material goes against a lasting quality or desire to last. Most of all, Sepik art works very often only serve for the purpose of one ritual and are then disposed of or destroyed. A rapid survey of Sepik sculptures indicates that a great number of forms show little volume, are often painted and meant to be seen either from up front or in profile, with a skillful combination of full and hollow parts. While Worringer's whole theory then seems to collapse, I wish to show that it is not so. Considering the small quantity of forms that use volume as their main aspect, and given a strong preference for flat dimensions, any third dimension is indeed annulled and "the metamorphosis of cubist impressions in flat impressions"83 being clearly the preferred choice and greatly strengthened through polychromy, it is obvious 74.

The notion of "individual enclosed materiality" unfortunately does not correspond to actual Sepik traditions, as the non-tectonic style of some patterns might indicate. Here the opposition noticed by Rudolf Arnheim between convex and concave forms is extremely relevant.84 If convexity in sculpture makes it difficult to combine such type of forms or architecture with others, the use of concavity in modern sculpture may allow for a better interaction of forms. A convex form asserts an entity within itself, isolated in a way that nullifies the space. This is exactly what Worringer described as the need for abstraction. In order to follow this hypothesis while respecting ethnographic data, we might assume that certain concave Sepik sculptures partake of this model. The link between Sepik sculpture and space is architectonic. Sepik art is not meant to be seen on its own in a secluded place.85 Among the latmul and the Sawos, art is destined to be situated in the men's house among a group of other similar works or to be inserted among the pieces of the front-structure, the sculpted posts, the high panes, the mast holding the gable and all the ornaments attached to it (paintings, human skulls, various decorations). Among the Abelam this integration is reinforced through an artistic arrangement of the front of the ancestors' house. This group-piece is derived from several needs. It states to whom the work and the motifs belong, i.e. the clan, it expresses the symbiosis between clan and ancestry, and it allows the knowledge of initiation rituals to remain hidden from the eyes of women and the noninitiated. Sculpted pieces are meant to be placed in a certain order and within the general architectural order, and their effect on their viewer depends on their very position, even if some need to be handled to achieve this. Consequently, all forms of nontectonic style lose their arbitrary character?attached to openwork sculptural presentation, not only because of their flatness, but because they were conceived as relative items, so that they belong to an architectonic system that exists outside them. By integrating sculpture within architecture, tectonic function is achieved in an indirect fashion. In this way, Worringer is "rehabilitated." As to the ephemeral quality of Sepik art, apart from the usual remark that these pieces quickly deteriorate due to climate and choice of materials (leaves, dried mud, wood, and other soft materials), several hypotheses are possible. One may assume that archaic societies proceed, in various manners, with a direct, magical capture of nature: neutralizing the apparent natural chaos, and detecting an underlying order using mimetic instinct, by way of associations and resemblances written on nature's ledger. What Sepik architecture shows is a living image of a well-ordered chaos, which is to say that space obeys rules in becoming inhabitable but which?due to the choice of organic materials, the precariousness of natural phenomena, the nontectonic style of numerous forms?reveals its great similarity with its environment. The order thus built reflects how fragile natural phenomena really are and partakes of the same chaotic balance. This is precisely what Rubin suggests, when speaking of a "fashioned" space rather than its "mapping," while comparing African and Oceanian art.86 Sepik art does not use definite and self-sufficient places or positions in space. If every object remains connected to its internal ruling principle, its potency being inseparable from its morphology, it also belongs to an external order that makes it a junction for its teleology. This is the transient art of the yam growers. Physis and tekhn?: the two worlds combine so well that Sepik art works?often rich in organic materials, vegetable fiber or bark sheets, as if to clarify this link? while interacting with their fluctuating and persistent surroundings, imitate time's cyclic nature and partake o? its lasting condition.87 Ephemeral art or traces of cyclic initiations that would require works to be renewed? The multiplicity of appearances, human, nonhuman, outside and inside, are entangled into the paradigmatic mask: maybe this is the formula for the prosperity of Sepik and Melanesian art, and why Breton was so enchanted by "the greatest immemorial effort to account for the criss-cross of physics and the mind, to triumph 84. R. Arnheim, La Pens?e visuelle [Visual Thought] (Flammarion, 1997), p. 146. 85. It sometimes happens, but remains exceptional, with the meditation figures of the Nor people at the mouth of the Sepik river (See Kaufmann [see note 71], p. 163). 86. W. Rubin, Le Primitivisme dans l'art du XX?me si?cle [Primitivism i n Twentieth-Century Art] (Flammarion, 1987), p. 47. If the African sculptor uses space "essentially as a way to bring off his full volumes," it becomes "a[n] important component of the [Melanesian] artist's aesthetics" since he does so without volume by using a uni-dimensional surface. Carl Einstein had, before Rubin, already noticed such oppositions between the two continents. 87. These cycles should include feminine cycles. All ritual activity on the part of Abelam men is connected to lunar cycles?the moon being viewed as female. For instance, the Abelam think that during the full moon the moon has gone away and withdrawn into its menstruation cabin (see Forge, note 66). Maybe, in the end, masculine perception of the natural cycles is derived from man's perception of the feminine cycles (which would go along with Breton's idea of the "pre-magic" role of sexuality).</page><page sequence="15">Chambrin: Style and standardization in some arts of the Sepik 167 over the dualism of perception and representation, so as not to stop at the bark but to work one's way up the sap."88 2.3 Other paths Traditionally, everything made by man is considered material that has been given form. Going back to Aristotle, the double concept of matter (hyl?) and form {eidos), so important to aesthetics, does not originate from art or works of art. This is also what Heidegger declares by questioning the essence of the tool. In so much as matter and form are explained through their uses, it is within the notion of tool that lies "the form matter concept."89 Different from art, the use of the object predetermines form as well as choice of matter. In other words, when it comes to tools, the final cause, among Aristotle's four causes, is essential. The distinction between a work of art and a tool is much more difficult to discuss than it seems. All forms produced in the Sepik have their usage and as such they are linked to various tools. Axes and adzes, weapons for war or for hunting?spears, propellers, shields. Tools for building furniture, hooks for hanging things, headrests and stools. Pottery, mortar for betel, bowls and containers, utensils for cooking. Dug-out canoes and prows. Musical instruments?drums and flutes for ceremonies. Costumes and body paintings. Items used for liturgy or initiation?skulls, statues, small and tall, masks. Obviously, and even if we disregard their promotion, adoption, and secularization, all these forms do not share the same statutes and do not belong to the same categories. In general, all are tools and, as such, their efficiency is inseparable from the form-matter concept. Tools imply standards. Rationalizations that are deduced from the conception of the thing as matter and form may very likely miss what is most important. If I have until now only spoken of Sepik art as art works and not tools, I must add to this. As a guideline we may begin with Guidieri's proposition: "when archaic determination of the objects is complete, there exists only two telos, so closely linked that they may be considered as the two sides of the same purpose: the purpose of ritual, a productive purpose, both being equal."90 Unfortunately, modern times have taken these objects out of their ritual sheaths, making it very difficult for anyone to approach the subject. In its pretence at regrouping everything under (and in) the name of aesthetics, modern thinking strips them of all ritual or magic roots.91 Sepik art forms may testify to a double telos?aim, purpose?both ritual and productive. Absent at first glance, the ancestors are nevertheless there, present, next to the living, mostly through all the objects they once used. In this sense, every form becomes a trace of their passage and hence they are all potentially "magic." Tribal, ancestral, and cosmic forces that go through the artist's repeated movements without him being clearly aware of it. Benjamin's sentence then takes on a much more profound sense: "if by the aura of an object submitted to all the pictures that, come from involuntary memory, tend to gather around it, this aura then corresponds, concerning such an object, to the very experience of the distance that is exerted on the latter, as an object that is used."92 Benjamin meant that the experience of the distance from which the aura is born 88.

It is quite a sad situation when most anthropologists, who due to their experiences in the field should be the best experts on the subject, leave others to study it. Indeed, this is what concluded Breton's questionnaire to the anthropologists of his day (see note 14, pp. 268-273). L?vi-Strauss's answer is surprisingly superficial. He sees the images proposed by Breton as "a very mec[h]anic illustration of local legends" (p. 268). Whereas Breton tries to understand what these ?mages really do, L?vi-Strauss rejects them as abstract and lifeless. With an absurd rationalism, L?vi-Strauss's approach and the way he opposes art and magic is quite emblematic of how small is his contribution to this question: "Magic [would] want to be really effective [. . .] without ever succeeding whereas art does, but always through a simulacrum or the imagination" (p. 268). But more serious is the present state of French anthropology. Let us remember the protests when the closing of the Mus?e de l'Homme [Museum of Man] in Paris was announced?and it is today closed. Much ado for spineless positions. Halfway protesting, the same ethnologists who only yesterday were signing petitions have most of them already secured an office in the new museum on Quai Branly. That anthropology should so compromise, under the pretence of universalism, is a disheartening fact of today's situation. It is not even a matter of the need?which Benjamin himself thought was legitimate in his reading of the decline of the aura?for proximity and large-scale appropriation, but rather a question of identity-oriented thinking, a matter of levelling that reduces any singularity to its nearest multiple and forgets whatever differences there in fact exist. What is there left of ethnology as an experience of otherness and as knowledge that is built around and is transmitted based on it? "Where there is no initiation," says Calasso, "there is the self-taught. Where knowledge is not a wisdom passed on by experience, we are then subscribing to a show-business University." (Calasso, see note 23, p. 327). 92. W. Benjamin, "Sur quelques th?mes baudelairiens" [On Some Motifs in Baudelaire], in uvres ///(Gallimard, 2000), p. 378.</page><page sequence="16">168 RES 47 SPRING 2005 "before it even manifests in looking at the object, is [temporarily] embodied within the object itself, which brings about a synthesis of its genealogy as object, of its origin."93 The origin is the activity that makes the object possible and echoes the experience that legitimizes all form in Sepik: imitation. For objects used during ritual, the aura inseparably qualifies the object's form. Thus the ancestor's effigy: its power is secured by the reproduction of canons and traditional motifs. Participation makes the mimetic act a legitimate one, and vice versa. This is all the more true of musical performance: the music of latmul flutes, played aside from anyone's eyes but in the presence of the invisible audience of women and children, cannot tolerate any technical error to achieve its purpose?the mystification of the noninitiated concerning the ancestral quality of the sounds produced. An indispensable performance, the perfect music is the voice of the ancestors. In a way, only the object involved in ritual activity completely meets the criteria of standardization. Its potency depends on it preserving formal continuity, inherited from long-lived tradition. Standardization is at its peak, for otherwise its ritualistic determination? ancestry called forth?would fail. Conceived as magic, an object is not as a result effectively magic. It is necessary to go further into our understanding of this telos. Could the position that the idea holds in connection with the object be the cause? If certain things are done for the purpose of magic?effigies, masks, but also paintings and the prows on canoes? others also have the same effect even if the aim was different. An adze is made for cutting into, says Guidieri, not for aura. Of course?and yet. Referring to the tradition, which goes back to Plato's Republic and Aristotle's Physics, the nature of the tool, Heidegger says, is its usefulness. But how useful a tool is Heidegger defines by Verl?sslichkeit?which could be translated as "reliability." Using a tool means one forgets it and therefore trusts it. It is so with a pair of shoes that we only see "for its very usefulness itself."94 In other words, the relationship of man to his tools could be qualified as one of Einf?hlung. If we understand it as meaning "participating" in the object, we must restrict this feeling to a kind of relation that is defined not by mediation but by immediacy. This seems all the more justified since Sepik tools, which still are "directly connected to a complete being, through an immediacy observed in every archaic tool."95 As long as it is still an extension of the body, of the arm of the man who is using it (Leroi-Gourhan), the archaic or preindustrial tool does indeed greatly resemble what it only prolongs. The tool is grasped by the hand, it is "handled." But the Einf?hlung feeling toward the object used in rituals is very different from a "simple" trust in what extends the body. The use of Heidegger's shoes is very different from the use of ritual instruments made in the Sepik. It all depends on what you call "purpose." The usefulness of an object in which one believes is neither the origin nor a variation of the economic usefulness of consumer oriented production. The theorem of secularization, so useful in many fields, could here only be misleading. The concepts of "tool" and "usefulness" are much too connoted in our culture. If Plato's negative criticism toward the arts does not include tools?whose value he establishes according to an adequate relation between copy and model?is it not because of their use? In a similar way, the classic distinction between artist and craftsman is strictly based on the criteria of usefulness. Heidegger agrees with this: "we do not yet think decisively enough the essence of doing. We only know doing as what produces an effect whose reality is appreciated according to how useful it is to us."96 Our conception of "making" and the conceptions of archaic societies are not much alike. Since the modern world has lost its traditions, the difference is not cultural anymore but actually metaphysic, and as such they are incomparable. But since Western art has acquired, through its own evolution, a universal signification, it seeks to deny such a difference to archaic objects. The growing number of museums is depending on this state of things: any object can now be aestheticized and as such be granted exhibition-value. "Can we make anything that is not a work of art?" asks Duchamp. What then can we say of archaic objects, of their purpose, as in the Sepik? These questions raise a single most inscrutable enigma: "What is a form that has presence?" Without neglecting religious or social context, but beginning by considering forms as such, Carl Einstein has tackled this problem in his study of African art. Here is what he says: The maker does his work much as any god would, which means that from the start he has distanced himselffrom the work which is the god or where it resides. His work is a 93.

The work, fruit of the artist's work, remains independent, it transcends and is free from any link. To this transcendence corresponds another conception of space which excludes any function of the spectator. This is a matter of giving and preserving a space that has been used to the utmost of its resources, a total and not a fragmentary space. A closed and self-sufficient space does not mean abstraction has occurred, but immediate sensation. This enclosure is not preserved unless the volume is fully grown, when nothing can be added to it. [. . .] The orientation of its parts is set not thinking of its viewers but because of its own needs; these are felt from the compact mass, and not thanks to the artist stepping back, which would lessen the object. [. . .] How finished and enclosed form and religion are means the same thing, just as formal realism and religious realism are superimposed.97 Apart from the polemic twist he gives his analysis, what first appears very clearly is the way Einstein does away with any usual meaning of the notion of usefulness or function?as exterior correlations of usage. Transcendence seems to be immanent to form; it may even preside over ritual uses. Einstein, by describing the craftsman as having "a pure pictorial vision," goes much farther than Worringer does. The object becomes the immediate abstraction, against the notion of "abstract form," as Jean Laude noticed. The work of the artist would then be a way of "worshipping from a distance." It is a double experience: Both aura and Einf?hlung. These two effects may be seen as contradictory: "empathy absorbs distance, cancels the difference between subject and object, and [should] then cancel aura itself."98 If Einf?hlung is a negation of otherness, this experience always remains a simulacrum, a desire for possession, which comes against the aura that keeps it a yearning desire. Action-reaction: the aura and Einf?hlung are the two opposites of the same conflicting force. The laws of physics would call it a distant force, as against contact force, which may define Einf?hlung. As in love there is no complete union, no matter how much we desire it; empathy remains solitary and never abolishes otherness. It may at best come close to it, as its limit.99 The main point, however, is that the entire process uses both sight and memory. Metaphorically, you could say that sight and memory constitute the field of the aura of emphatic forces. According to Benjamin, images of aura spring from involuntary memory. It is a power of reminiscence that creates unique pictures. But, so that reminiscence may occur, forgetting must be present. Forgetting is the condition of involuntary memory. According to Carl Einstein's interpretation, everything happens as if the artist, who "has distanced himself since the beginning," forgot his own intervention, the history of the thing as he has made it, and only sees in it what is essential and non-made. Contact from a distance, form calls for eyes that no longer see: it is to be desired in the dark. The aura as an obstacle to distance would mostly depend on the object itself: tectonic form, cubic solutions, closed space. Concerning the Sepik, there is no "god which preserves its inherent mythical reality," but genealogies of ancestors who remember and forget; no objects that have "formal autonomy," but architectonic or shifting forms, sometimes hollowed, often lavishly decorated, and most of them ephemeral. The preceding hypothesis according to which the idol effigy seems to require volume is above all effectively contradicted by flat or hollowed works, which nonetheless embody something. For instance, the malu board of the latmul or the Sawos, a flat piece of carved wood that has been hollowed and can be as high as six feet, of unspecified use, is sometimes seen as an effigy of men who have died during initiation rituals, sometimes as a means to hang skull-hooks?unless one approaches this hollowed form as an expression that encloses the exterior of the body to only retain its inside? This would be true to the latmul conception of the human body, attributing a female origin to flesh and 97. C. Einstein, La Sculpture N?gre [Negerplastik] (L'Harmattan, 1998), pp. 348-349. 98. Guidieri (see note 27), p. 49. 99. It is significant that any experience of real knowledge goes, in Melanesia, without any mediation, except for music and masks (as a means of possession for those who wear it): only oracles, dreams, and revelation may achieve the vision of what is authentic, which is ancestry. This high power of the revealed image would then be due to it not being a limit but a boundary of the psychic body, beyond the Cartesian mind/body dualism (the mask, as a hollow effigy and as a possible incarnation would then also be part of this dialectic boundary). The object that withholds Einf?hlung could therefore be considered as the tangible manifestation of what was already once thought and must be used to maintain, restore, or remind of the belief. The revealed image, through dream or trance, is also an enigma image, with a status similar to that of an aporia or an equation. Such could be the reason and actual meaning of the initiation secret: an experience, literally incommunicable. This is why "the teachings of initiation can only use ritual or symbols, which suggest more than they express, [. . .] making possible the inner work that will [. . .] allow each one to reach the secret [. . .] according to his abilities." (R. Guenon, Aper?us sur l'initiation [Perspectives on Initiation] (Paris: Traditionnelles, 2000), p. 90).</page><page sequence="18">170 RES 47 SPRING 2005 blood?perishable materials?whereas the skeleton? form and matter that remains?bears the marks of the father.100 The eternal quality attributed to ancestry has possibly led to keeping only the bone structure of the human body as imperishable; a way, then, of claiming that both the human body and nonhuman beings are immortal and enduring. Could the skeleton, the result of body alteration, be so construed as the paragon for all those forms with fractured volumes that at the same time embody and deny time its power? Let us be careful not to conclude that there is a formal similitude to a ritualistic filiation. It would mean that one naively believed that the language of forms had alone been spared the semantic dispersal of Babel. Because of the problem of the multiplicity of Melanesian solutions, I turn to Benjamin's idea that "what is typical of authentic aura is ornament, an ornamental ring within which things and beings are solidly enclosed as if in a sheath."101 Might the production of Melanesian forms then rely on an aura located in the distance created by ornamentation and the use of surfaces? It is true that the act of painting, unlike that of sculpting, is considered in many Sepik cultures as a magic art, subject to many precautions and taboos that must be heeded. Often the work does not acquire its magic power until color is applied to its surface. Among the Abelam and Arapesh peoples, painting is a magic substance: color supersedes line and form, color "activates" the object. Still, even with common tools with which the form-volume/ornament distinction seems appropriate, it is impossible to be reasonably satisfied with considering ornament as an added element that would "embellish" an object whose purpose would not be artistic. The ornament brings completion to the thing, the form thus achieved becomes authentic. Only then do all these objects possess their definitive existence. This result is one: tool ornament, sculpture-painting, decorated yams. Besides, the aura is not only a sensual thing. It also belongs to the eye of the beholder looking into "the eye of the thing" (Chirico), it is a matter of apperception, which considerably differs depending on how the object is handled for practical purposes or put on display during ritual or initiation. The "potency" of the created object generally is not a fact of the object itself but emanates from its participation in a ceremony, often accompanied by music, singing, and dancing: thus with masks and dance costumes, and with sculptures whose place in the ceremonial and architectural space is just as important to the ritual. They belong to a program involving movement?masked men, dancers?and stillness?the decorum of the ritual itself and the spectator as a passive participant. Also one must distinguish between usage and use. Since Duchamp and his ready-mades, we know how easy it is to divert any object from its original status through conceptual devices. If promoting a tool to the level of an aesthetic object cancels its function or use, it has been so with every society and for a long time. The emblematic example from the Sepik is the latmul ceremonial stool. Its form makes it a tool, yet it is not meant for sitting. It is never used as a stool, equal with all other stools, within the men's houses. What is then the "diverted purpose" of this archaic ready-made? In his vivid accounts of the verbal sparring that takes place around this so-called stool, Bateson reveals the use of what is really a desk.102 A pivotal ritual piece of furniture, it gives pose to the orator and is different from other stools because of its sculpted back representing the face of an ancestor, whose authority legitimizes the speeches. The gestures made around this desk accompany the important moments of the speech, which consists in an endless rhythmic recitation of genealogies, chanted with dracaena or leaflets of coconut-tree bouquets spread on this desk. In a similar way, the surrealist dialectic of "found objects" also has echoes in the Sepik. Considered as evoking the spirits of ancestors or dead enemies, the mbwan are, for the latmul, simple standing stones. A natural object, the stone nevertheless does not appear to be part of physis, thanks to it being exhibited in a way as to abolish its origin. Because of its permanence and reappropriated function, it may be used as a dialectic means, along with "real" relics (skulls), various attributes of the dead body and of the mythic model, in a way similar to what Guidieri has witnessed among the Fatalekas: an object whose purpose depends on its aspects taken as a paradigm of intransience and of change, halfway between physical manifestations of the dead body (the relic is the indestructible remnant of the altered material) and of the eternal ancestral identity.103 The archaic object, created or found, is no longer a utensil as soon as it has been given a specific potency. 100.

The tool that is handled for practical purposes is an unequivocal object that belongs to usage and has little exhibition value. Others, with a limited usage value, or at least an ambiguous one, have strong exhibition qualities. For the latter, everything is different because they involve a "making" and a "showing." We know of the useful value of a shield. But when a war party is set in the Sepik, shields are painted long before any action is taken, in order to frighten the enemy who is within range of arrows or spears?within seeing range. Colors strengthen a double message and need to be shown: the faces or painted motifs on the shields tell of the power of the invisible auxiliary behind the bearer of the shield and certainly summon this supernatural being's assistance next to his prot?g?. In case of an attack, the shield has to be used only as a shield, naked and devoid of aura. There would not be any cult without this difference between use and show. In modern terms, this would correspond to the difference between production and consumption, a difference that is necessary as much as it prevents one's wanting to know more. Seeing is not doing. Or rather "seeing" can always be made into "doing," and this means that one is then more concerned with "having people see it." This ontological divorce common to all cultures is at the heart of the aura and Einf?hlung problematic, as well as Marx's theory of the phantasmagoria of goods. Sight and memory: what is originally known of the object is forgotten, the discarding of the product's "having-been made" and of its use-value are the conditions of its reification and becoming a fetish. The aura of merchandise is nothing else but this "disarray that has the object floating away, becoming self-sufficient" and able to move around.104 Without this "trick" to which we passively assent, there would be no magic, nor adoration of merchandise. The distinction made by Benjamin between ritual value and exhibition value should then be reconsidered, so great is the "theatricality" of archaic cultures. This would also mean differentiating between liturgical objects, seen by everyone, and initiation and esoteric objects, hidden from women and the non initiated. Fabricated for the purpose of a coming initiation, the latter, once unveiled, correspond to the criteria of the truth of aura: they give way to an "extraordinary track of time and space," which is shown to the young initiate within the special boundaries of ritual, thanks to the power of distance. The same goes for the experience of "shock," characteristic of post-Baudelaire times, and associated by Benjamin with the decline of aura and to the preference now given to exhibition value over ritual value. But the willingly frightening apparition of the mask is intended to shock, as is the case with most rituals. From reading Benjamin one understands that ritual is often understood as meaning prayer or contemplation. He is not obsessed with icons and seems to be content with this rather limited approach to the ritual performance. Icons or idols have no place in the Sepik, to be worshipped in private or in the dark. Cult and show are inseparable. There is one thing that should be said in Benjamin's favor, with reference to a short passage in which the experience of shock is considered as a possible premise to the coming of aura: "rituals, ceremonies and celebrations proceed, in between those two qualities of memory [voluntary and involuntary], with a constantly renewed merging. They cause remembering to occur on certain precise moments and enable it to happen again all through life."105 Does this mean that there is a reproducible kind of aura, which would not be authentic? A "unique apparition of what is so distant and so close" ritually determined? Without there being a real end to initiation, which would mean that every mystery is revealed, there is a long period during which, for the young initiate, the ritual appearance of masks and effigies of ancestors and the music of flutes or drums seems to mean the coming of threatening or frightening entities. The case of women is more complex, but they certainly are in the know, pretending not to know and being an intricate part of the mystification of children and noninitiates. More so since here belief is close to gullibility. These objects remain hidden and their nature is kept secret, so that hiding the fact that they were "made" is most effective. If all reiteration means one forgets what the thing is (Adorno), the staging of these apparitions is strictly directed toward this end: for the young initiate, masks and effigies that speak are the ancestors. Although at this stage, there are only "small secrets" (Gu?non). The Einf?hlung experience, which is still marked by a "delegate" mediation that forces one to be passive, is not really one. Also, the atrophy of modern experience is quite certainly the consequence of a mediation, of "the fact that the show is exterior to man's doing, because his gestures are no longer his own, but belong to someone else representing him."106 The age of 104.

But "real" Einf?hlung rejects mediation as much as it can. It operates through a close contact with the object and, through it, with the ancestor or the nonhuman. It is in this sense that the "delegate" mediation, as discussed above, is not yet an Einf?hlung experience. Having forgotten or lost its traditions, this way of connecting with things no longer belongs to the West. Neither does it belong to a way of thinking found only among archaic societies, as L?vy-Bruhl and his disciples believed. It is much more a special condition of exceptional perception?possession, trance, ecstasy, or however one may wish to call it?which necessitates physical as well as intellectual preparation, and which requires this long and painful process of initiation to take place. It is very significant that the basic gullibility of the young initiate is the necessary condition of true belief. This is impossible until the fabrication has been exposed: that flutes and drums are played by men, that the masks are but the uncles or fathers of the young initiates. No doubt there is something unheimlich and traumatic about finding out the truth, a strangely disquieting experience if we consider that it echoes the original Verleugnung experience?disavowal, repudiation?the infantile belief in the maternal phallus contradicted by reality. It is easy to recognize, here, the experience on which Freud based his theory of the fetish: the belief that the mother has a phallus is the first knowledge one rejects, before any other, and is a model for all repudiations. The Verleugnung is also an Aufhebung, in Hegel's sense of what is negated as well as preserved. Or rather transformed, due to primary processes. Only memory is erased, leaving room for the "true" belief, that of the adults, and replacing gullibility, which meant mainly terror and paralysis. "I know, but still . . ." and "we realize that there is only a but still because of the I know." For instance, there are only fetishes because the fetishist knows very well that women do not have a phallus."108 In the same way, there is no possible Einf?hlung before the initiate knows that the mask or any other means of belief is not the ancestor.109 In Adorno's beautiful definition art is magic only once it has been freed from the lie of being the truth. Which means, in Mannoni's words, that there is not a preemptive belief in magic, but a magic of belief itself.110 So much more than a simple trick of reason: an act that opens onto an immense dimension. Magic thought has nothing infantile or primitive about it, on the contrary. Mannoni states that children and women, with their real or disguised ignorance, could be the recipients of the beliefs rejected by adults, knowing that the initiates will soon take part in the mystification themselves. It would have been useful to know if, like the Hopi people, the use of masks in the Sepik was a way of differentiating this mystification from the one used to hide the mystic truth from children who shall be initiated. Whichever proves to be the case, it is clear that the importance of the initiation secret necessitates the securing of the objects used for its purposes. The most radical solution is to erase all traces of these by simply destroying them: a sacrificial action that allows what is irreversibly destroyed to ensure future life. The transformation of belief through Verleugnung could be something sacrificial: rejecting what is sacred, the terror which otherwise paralyzes, in order to be able to communicate with it at the same time. "There is the balance, the entanglements of sacrifice: communion, exclusion."111 The order must be smaller than the matter it orders, otherwise nature and culture, physis and socius, could not be differentiated. The surplus, what remains of nature versus culture, is accursed and must be sacrificed, thus introducing a difference.112 "The only order that does not use visible exclusion would coincide with vegetal metabolism: a culture that could maintain without being based on a differentiation, thus without any basis, a culture undetectable from the sound of the wind in a tree."113 Our culture has reversed pre-modern 107.

Modern times, on the contrary, assert that equality is a value and regards the socius as sacred?as an alibi? Its evolution, which has led to a denial of any authority, has allowed a much more ferocious hierarchy to settle in?rich, poor?but based on a power that no longer depends on authority but on a pragmatic order. Although it has no name, sacrifice is still present today under the disguise of technique. Becoming rootless again, it moves its ritual everywhere?experimentation, once no longer new, quickly caught by an endless movement on a planetary scale. The industry of show gathers the crumbs of technique. The phantasmagorical value of goods, the "New," could very well be what remains today of immolation: an obscure quantity of matter has been burnt to produce it. This is why modern technique relies on reproductability. Heidegger calls Gestell enframing, or Arraisonnement according to the French translation, the way modern technique reveals a power that demands of each and every thing that it state its reason, wanting reality as a whole to be committed.U4 Sacrifice in archaic societies is based on "the supposition that something else, many other things, invisible ones, respond to a right action. [. . .] Experimentation [modern technique] is based on the supposition that right action may be achieved through accumulation. We try a thousand things, uncertain and in the dark. Only one will be the right action. All the others, with the waste of energy they imply, are lost."115 With this process, man himself is given as sacrificial background for pragmatic technique. Its most ferocious application in this world is the making and dealing of weaponry and its field of application, which is war. A well-known secret. If we refuse both name and memory, if technique only serves as a justification for practical reasons, sacrifice yet demands that we be extremely aware of destruction: thus with modern sacrificial priests, the politicians. 2.4 Style, standardization, and the exchange of forms Style and standardization: these two concepts are largely ambiguous and almost indivisible. We may think of style as resulting from an artistic striving for integration into tradition and community. Form is indeed only understandable through its exemplary nature, which makes it possible to be shared. Of course, unless one is trying to reproduce exactly an already existing work, Sepik artists work without actual criteria to validate the forms they may use. The limitations on style depend less on social or collective demands on the part of a community implementing its strict frames than on an unchangeable, inherited lexicon of forms from which the artist can choose the necessary elements. Style cannot be described any other way than along the lines of the standardization of forms. For archaic societies, style would be to standardization what mimesis is to methexis: a making directed by a double telos, both ritual and productive, which partakes of a traditional order, the guarantee for the authenticity of the forms and only legitimation for mimesis. The relation between style and standardization would not have much to gain by considering form as the expression of style and standardization when "at a dialectic rest," considering the dynamics of these two notions' internal-external variations, the secret rules of their metamorphosis. This approach would partially go along with the principle of the lesser difference as mentioned above. From this angle, style mainly presupposes change. Form is not only structure, it is also action: it may become "formula and canon" writes Focillon, "which is to say it may be a sudden stop, an exemplary type, but it is first and foremost part of an ongoing and moving world."116 This is all the more true as in archaic societies, if the principle of form has always been that they can be reproduced (Benjamin), there may not be any copy made in the image of what modern industry has permitted through technical reproduction. Tradition itself is open to change and, in general, the strictness of traditional order is not so as to prevent any innovation of forms. Tradition is an evolving form, depending on a memory that gets thinner and thinner as time goes by. It remains an order, which is valid as an authoritative reference, in place for every generation to refer to. This order encompasses changing forms and styles, these being "united by a reciprocal convenience whose harmony is variously made, undone and redone."117 The magnitude of formal variations, including perceptible changes between sculptures from the same place and hands, cannot be considered as the fruit of 114.

Among the latmul, the coexistence of different stylistic tendencies is linked to different conceptions of the meaning or the content of representations of the world or of identity.118 Heterogeneous styles may also be attributed to the great number of exchanges, uncommon in New Guinea. In a region covered by an immense and impenetrable forest, dense and swampy, the many rivers allow Sepik canoe travellers to enjoy cultural exchanges. The high entanglement of aesthetic motifs?brought about either through commercial exchange or modifications of supremacy or domination?shows the insufficiency of a holistic and autarkical approach of these societies, and the idea that local forms belong to a single local group. Style and motifs of a work do not necessarily belong to the same ritual tradition. A purely geographic inventory of stylistic areas, as B?hler has proposed in an appendix, can only be secondary. This states very directly the problem of the limits of the chosen ethnographic area. As it is impossible to be absolutely exhaustive, it becomes an arbitrary choice for the ethnologist to circumscribe his study to a sector both limited in space and time. It is those same questions that arose during the debate around the definition of an ethnic group or of ethnicity. Does it depend on a presupposed "heart" or irreducible cultural core from which to infer any further change, or does it depend on opportunistic strategies based on a well-thought-out choice of historic or cultural references? A dynamic approach is necessary so as to better understand the problem of identity in relation to the relational?and not substantial?dimension of ethnic belonging. It then goes with style as it does with ethnicity. Contrary to a steady and homogeneous type, stylistic studies should not disregard the fluctuating characteristics and the importance of social boundaries. A style does not exist outside its interaction with other styles. The proof of this is the large exchange route, favorable to transfers like none other, of the great Sepik river. Does this mean that specific qualities are fading in the Sepik, that they are forever melting into each other, depending on trade, encounters, and war parties themselves?which tend to unify the weapons used? Whereas myths are in limited number, they interact with one another and can be found everywhere as if they emerged from the same source;119 the world of form, on the contrary, defies comparison. It is made of worlds that are almost completely closed onto themselves, where particulars rule and not generalities, and which in Melanesia is conceived within the frame of cultural unity, sometimes only some hundreds of people. In the absence of a common model, there is no large-scale standardization. Small communities, aware of their neighbors' customs, have refused foreign notions and perpetuated their singular creation?a condition of their survival. It is quite probable that diversity is as much a cause of the isolation of certain groups as it is a consequence of the exchanges and oppositions that unite them, each culture having developed its own style according to rules that guarantee they will be understood from within the group and are strongly differentiated when faced with the outside. And yet, it is a mosaic all the more surprising as neither lifestyle, nor social institutions, nor legends ever maintain such fixed borders between these groups. While Abelam or latmul societies may share many things, their aesthetics are very different.120 If some measure of influence is visible, it never endangers the "unity" to which these societies lay such a strong claim. It also happens that a culture will almost completely adopt the forms of another: the mountain Arapesh for instance, whose houses of ceremony, sculptures, and paintings are practically all taken from the neighboring Abelam.121 But separated from their original meaning, these imported elements are reinterpreted according to Arapesh tradition and mythology. If the architecture of an Arapesh men's house is a copy of the Abelam's, its content and meaning?its syntax as it were?have been modified. It must be observed, though, that neither language nor secret rituals can be serious obstacles to the transmission of the meaning of the works. The known cases of bilingualism or marriage between Abelam and Arapesh could have permitted the integration of ritual activities via established cultural connections.122 If such was not the case, it is probably because of a strong will on the part of the Arapesh to appropriate Abelam forms along the lines of their own means of expressing and signifying their beliefs. The reasons for this mysterious transaction remain obscure. Contrary to what Forge had been able to see while staying among the Abelam, the Arapesh have evolved a large body of myths.

If we are to rely on B?hler, "the quantity of forms that one encounters in some areas of Sepik country is due to the many relationships that unite different groups together. Despite traditional hostility, quarrels and man hunts, exchanges have been taking place for ages, trading goods but also ritual statues, masks, rites and singing."124 The importance of these exchanges in the Sepik valley has probably been overestimated by some ethnologists concerning certain types of objects. If it is true that forms are transient due to the various places of intensive trade, the sharing of objects belonging to ritual does not have a great part in this. The objects that are most traded seem to be either tools or ornaments: bracelets, armbands, necklaces, shells and shell necklaces, belts and ornaments worn on the head and chest, and plumes and nose decorations.125 They are worn by the person, shown and sometimes offered or exchanged. These ornaments?or parures, a word that comes from para?tre, i.e. to "appear"?Guidieri calls "traps," "ways of exchanging baits" because these "involve [relationships between men]: they are binding, respected, under threat."126 These objects must be "appealing, must be coveted by others because they do not have them, before they are caught by the gripping obligation to reciprocate."127 Already Simmel had noticed in the essence of parures worn "this glitter [. . .] by which the person wearing the decorations appears to be in the center of a halo of light encompassing all who stand near, all those watching."128 A double tendency, centripetal and centrifugal, defines the forces at work in parures: these forces heighten the feeling of prestige surrounding the bearer at the expense of others, forces that attract the eye and trap the viewer, and in the end make him a point of envy for all. It is due to a certain formal impersonality that these two tendencies do coincide. "Because at the service of the individual, [a parure] must not be individual itself. [Thus] the focus on the person that disappears, the generalization which goes beyond the unity of the person, while preserving individuality as its basis or as its aura, or capturing it as a large flowing river?there is the essence of [the standardization of parures]; it is with this instinctive knowledge that [it] has always been created in the relatively strict rules of a given style."129 It is therefore not very surprising to notice that parures are also used as a currency for exchanges in the Sepik.130 It is this "more-than-what-you-see that gives value to parures." The whole purpose of this is to obtain a sheen that is substantially different from the cult of images, where the surface-volume distinction is based on volumes that make one see what there is elsewhere. The phantasmagorical "aura" of parures resides in the "distance from these objects [which] can only be felt when they are mostly a surface-effect, and is made possible by a complete availability toward them, in which what is called coveting plays a major part."132 The effigy is different from parures in as much as it is a form that calls for a presence; it withholds belief, testifies to tradition and origin. A parure can be, in a certain way, a simulacrum, but of its own essence and because it was owned: a fake object of belief, but able to guarantee phantasmagoria. 123. Ibid., p. 172. 124.

To give and to take: the acceptance of this connection, of the necessary reciprocation on which archaic societies base their sacrificial dealings, a ceremonial attitude toward life. The first exchange happens with nature: plants, animals?and beyond with the invisible powers with which they are invested. Whoever takes and does not give, in the Sepik, perhaps destroys something never to return. This would break up all trade. What pathos this action would correspond to would be that of murder, at the center of any transaction. There is no natural death in the Sepik: all death is sacrificial. "Here appears the wonderful sacrificial device: substitution. [. . .] The treachery that allows a substitute to be slaughtered on the altar, and not the thing itself, [could] bring about an increase of power, such that as it expands, it [would] completely erase from conscience the necessity of the sacrificial gift. The pure exchange, which is systematic substitution, [would] gradually erase all unity?the memory of the primal victim." (Calasso (see note 23), pp. 246-247). 128. G.

Everything depends on the position of the idea in these work-experiences. Modern times would have us customize these objects by qualifying all of them economically, enforcing a hierarchy that gives everything a price-tag. However, this customization simultaneously pretends that some things are priceless.133 The direction taken by our cultures today is to exacerbate this impossibility. The position of the idea hence seems to be over-determined by a process that gives it its value, which the word "economic" might qualify, but more metaphorically than in terms of quantity. With archaic societies, economy is a secondary qualifier: the idea is not affected (neither before nor after it has "become" an object). Parures and effigies share a common exhibition-value; but their natures are different. During initiation, or the mystification of non-initiates, the showing of the effigy itself is monitored and brief: the gullibility or the Einf?hlung cannot take place unless all things presented are short-lived. The surprise effect is an important dimension of their perception. On the other hand, parures are not to be handled and their exhibition need not be discrete: the greater part of their potency lies precisely in their exhibition.134 What is particular with exchanges as they take place in Melanesia,135 which undeniably depend on objects that are exchanged, can also be interpreted thus: "their circulation answers a quest for identity, and [it] can only occur within the frame of rigid and highly personal social structure, it needs a c//enfe/e."136The immanent Melanesian conception of the world is characterized by an unfinished identity, which cannot reach its end outside the realm of ancestry.137 It is therefore probable that the quest for identity, always unfinished, acts as a stimulus for exchanges and the circulation of forms. If parures are the main vector, could it not be because they fill, or mask, a gap which their forms call for or even imply? A gap which would echo the "gaps" of immanence, the incomplete identity? Ancestry is puti in the Abelam language, the void that men try to know and tame through rituals and genealogy, but which only death can grant access to. This gap is quickly filled with trickery and passion, thirst for prestige and identity. Knowing full well that any appropriation of immanence is short-lived, men and women cover their bodies with parures whose circulation shows that they have no fear of giving up their belongings, that the value of these parures is ephemeral because it is forever invalidated by new desires. In a similar way?though of less anthropological interest?tools can be seen as objects conceived from the human body's incomplete condition. As an extension of the human arm, the archaic tool is there to replace what the body lacks. These objects also are traps because of their magic: they capture invisible forces, but according to a different direction than that of parures or effigies. With tools, what is hidden remains invisible because it is not human.138 Their efficiency and 133. I leave it open to decide whether such a customization exists, before any production begins, or whether it imagines the object when it has already appeared. 134. These categories are not as defined as they might seem. The mask, for instance, combines the attributes of parure and effigy: it both embodies and decorates, necessarily and simultaneously. If it is exhibited as a parure element, the mask must nevertheless hide the face of the bearer in order to invoke a presence. It also has to be hollow and hollowed enough for the bearer to be embodied in it, which suggests the question of its formal qualities: when is a mask really a mask and a member of the class of effigies, and when is it part of a parure? Obviously, these questions are irrelevant when it comes to full effigies, which one cannot put on and be embodied in. 135. The most famous example from Melanesian anthropological studies is the Kula trading system, studied by B. Malinowski in the Trobriand Islands, on the eastern edge of New-Guinea {Les Argonautes du pacifique occidental [Argonauts of the Western Pacific] (Gallimard, 1989 [1922]). 136. Guidieri (see note 25), p. 85. 137. Ancestry is immanent indeed, it secures the permanence of the social body through time: for what is an ancestor if not an old deceased? What is a dead body if not a future ancestor? A transcendant perspective aims at possessing this unfinished quality. In Polynesia, the existence of deities partakes of the divine-derived authority of the leaders and legitimates hereditary power according to genealogy. What results from this is an encompassing power allowing for the federation of large communities such as the great Polynesian kingdoms. Oppositions between Polynesian and Melanesian types (conception of the world, of filiation, of identity) may help see the surface of the problem, or at least a relevant connection regarding the oft-mentioned but yet unresolved mystery of the almost complete absence of masks in Polynesia. Tattooing is very common, marking one's gender, one's social status or wealth, and is accessible to everyone. My purpose is not to offer an interpretation of masks in a symmetrical comparison with tattoos, but to underline two opposed solutions among the many solutions attested in Oceanian societies. On the one hand there is the Melanesian mask-bearer, with an ambiguous and specifically ritual identity, the mobile mask that shows the presence and absence of ancestry in intervals through a simultaneous handling of the spirits of ancestors and the minds of the noninitiated. On the other hand there is the tattooed Polynesian face, a secured identity, an unremovable one, which finds its place among a greater architectural transcendance where the ideology of absolute difference recognizes no statutory void. 138.

Some more prestigious tools, such as lime-containers for betel, are highly desirable items, like parures, and therefore much exchanged. Effigies are different and do not become part of communities other than their own. For reasons already mentioned?their forms embody a presence and testify to origin and tradition?they are not or rarely exchanged. When exchanged, the effigy that has been acquired from an outside party generally remains something exotic and is not assimilated by the group, or else becomes a new means of sharing the experience of a new reality, and must be suitably named. Bowden gives us the example of a sculpture offered by the Malu to the Kwoma?traditionally enemy societies?which had been given to them about fifty years ago at that time. It was an engraved sculpture that the Kwoma had made their own and integrated with their ceremonies. The Kwoma named it yena, the name for their own traditional sculptures, but they never made copies of it.139 The other instance of such an exchange is also emblematic of the Arapesh people. Having a highly developed sense of hospitality toward new things, it seems that what they appreciate most in Abelam effigies is their exoticism.140 To own such items is good for the reputation of the village throughout the country. Subsequently, Abelam effigies that were imported, distinct from local production, were finally regarded as nothing more than oddities, of little interest compared to significant or important items.141 Tuzin had the opportunity to observe that an imported Abelam statue made no sense to the Arapesh. It is said to have ended in some dark corner of their house of ceremony.142 The Arapesh showed little interest for Abelam effigies and did not copy or even try to preserve them.143 The appeal of exotic forms is not specific to the Arapesh alone. In the Sepik these objects are quite coveted indeed, but do not belong to the category of effigies. The Abelam will for instance go far from their territory to find the colors for their paintings, and it seems this remoteness itself is part of their magic.144 If it is true that "social elements, like axis of sight, converge much better from afar," it is possible that the exotic origin within the Sepik of some forms favors their integration into the group.145 Just as fashion when imported is "all the more appreciated by a group because it did not originate from it," it could allow this strange kind of socialization that occurs due to a common relation to a distant point.146 Arapesh culture has been much altered by the integration of Abelam forms, so that there may be a point when a group is saturated and when the assimilation of foreign forms? objects, rituals, dances?becomes morbid and dysfunctional. The Arapesh pursuit of what is new could be the recent consequence of a tradition that has become less united because of Abelam domination: "An art that begins to doubt its mission and ceases to be "inseparable from usefulness" (Baudelaire) must make what is New its supreme value."147 The destruction of some effigies after they have been used during ritual is evidence enough that effigies in particular are never allowed to be exchanged. This sacrificial behavior could be related to the archetype of sacrifice, cannibalism, as a necessary step toward ancestry. It is when "the flesh of the sacrificial victim is assimilated, though consumption, to human flesh" that ancestry may "happen."148 To consume is to destroy while appropriating. Initiation would be such an education: the initiate symbolically dies and learns to "gulp," as the sunken-eating ogre-ancestor of Sepik myths, a threat still there during early childhood when seeing masks. For Benjamin the phantasmagorical effect is manifest when the object, being new, appears?when, "hesitating [. . .] on the threshold," it is not yet a piece of merchandise.149 The Einf?hlung of the initiatic object operates only because it is ephemeral, its destruction is the assurance that it will never be worn out. This agrees with Batailie's idea that, "sacrifice renders sacred what common usage has degraded and made unholy."150 The 139. R.
