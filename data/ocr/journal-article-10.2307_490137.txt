<plain_text><page sequence="1">"What to Make of a Diminished Thing": Modern Nature and Poetic Response Bonnie Costello There seems to be a continual tension in American poetry between what Lawrence Buell has called a Thoreauvian "aesthet- ics of relinquishment" and what Richard Poirier has called an Emersonian superfluity (Buell 143-180; Poirier 37-85). Tho- reau's aesthetic is motivated by an "ethics of restraint," according to Buell, while the ethos of extravagance clearly lies behind the Emersonian tradition as Poirier has described and endorsed it. Nature, paradoxically, is the ethical standard for both traditions, suggesting just how malleable nature is as a concept and trope. Thoreau, the early conservationist, sees an economical and even abstemious nature, where "necessity" is the measure of value, against human waste, and all things exist in a cooperative ecol- ogy. One must relinquish not only goods, but also enterprise and subtending consciousness itself, in favor of a Heideggerian Da- sein of immanent dwelling (Buell 157). Emerson's nature, by con- trast, thrives on excess and expansion, which contributes to the transitional, prospective character of life. Superfluity, for Emer- son and Poirier, is central to the principle of change in nature and culture; indeed, artificial life is not so much derived from natural life as it is an expression of it.1 Our productivity puts us in touch with the fluency of the universe, even as one invention becomes the casualty of another. Loss is a prerequisite of gain. "Excess and madness create, by the disappointed hopes they en- gender, a new equilibrium beyond the circle of the old one" (Poirier 52). Environmentalists are less gleeful about the conse- quences of excess, of course, and less willing to identify nature's extravagance with humanity's, seeing humans only as a threat to the wealth of nature. On the one hand, Poirier's promise that the principle of superfluity is self-correcting in terms of any inade- quate system it devises, that capitalist exhaustion will bring about its own corrective equilibrium (Poirier 54), will not inspire those yearning after the lost wilderness. On the other hand, the ethics of restraint may never satisfy the fecund imagination of</page><page sequence="2">570 Modern Nature and Poetic Response the culture and its entrepreneurial individuals, who want to go on creating not just works of the imagination but things of mate- rial substance as well, even if that productive energy performs a kind of violence on the existing world. What are humans to do if not proliferate and even struggle to dominate? As A. R. Ammons writes in "Strip": is the young man endowed with skills and violences to find no focus all day except that of idling around the steps of his apartment house; ... there are no sabertooths anymore but what is a man to do when there are none. (Glare 58) It is the job of the poet, like other entrepreneurs, to find out. My interest in this essay is in a latter-day poetics of super- fluity, chastened from its precursors' easy appeal to American space. The new poetics is canny about the ways we construct the nature we appeal to, but still irrepressible in both the urge to invent and the desire to appeal to the natural world as a source of value. The poems I examine here offer no simple solutions to problems of environmental or cognitive dissonance that arise from human superfluity. They do not even call for solutions, only for an imaginative reckoning other than grief and rage.2 Nor do they offer any firm definition of "nature" as a corrective to Ro- mantic depth or postmodern simulation. They experiment wildly with definition, in the spirit of lyric superfluity; they take nature as a concept itself unfixed. Nature has come to represent less a discrete space of retreat, idealization, or legitimation than a flu- ent actuality through which we know and alter our frames. Po- etry, for these poets, is not designed to establish epistemological or ethical truths, but neither is it indifferent to epistemological inquiry or immune from ethical motivation or scrutiny. What these poems do perform in an exemplary way is the adjustment of the imagination to a perceived diminishment or blight, an ad- justment that does not flinch or evade but rechannels rather than restrains creative energy. As such they might (through example and analogy rather than directive) suggest ways that human "su- perfluity" can be brought into accord with environmental values, if these are adjusted to appreciate the dynamism of nature and the historicity of local ecologies.</page><page sequence="3">American Literary History 571 The Thoreauvian aesthetics of relinquishment has certainly dominated nature poetry in recent times. The impulse to return to nature as a retreat from cultural excess persists in the literary imagination. The idealism of this position, as Buell has shown, involves beating Romanticism at its own game, surrendering not only goods but the self. "The attempt is made by certain modern Anglo-American poets to imagine lyric personae as conduits or registers of environmental stimuli" rather than as subjects (Buell 161). We can recognize this attempt in such diverse writers as Robinson Jeffers, William Carlos Williams, Gary Snyder, Ted Hughes, Robert Bly, David Wagoner, W. S. Merwin, Mary Oliver, Wendell Berry, and Donald Hall. But the poetry of blighted places is not all lamentation and rage, and the human smudge does not necessarily mar a reciprocity with nature. Elizabeth Bishop saw a rainbow in a pool of bilge; Allen Ginsberg found a sunflower near a railroad track. Such images celebrate the persis- tence of the supervening imagination, not its erasure. From Walt Whitman to Ammons a line of American poetry (we might call it a poetry of superfluity) has confronted the changes in the land- scape brought about by the human will to enter, transform, ab- stract, and exploit the environment. It has sometimes veiled from itself the harsher consequences of this expansiveness, or retreated from the ethical dilemmas connected with human excess. At other times it has addressed them directly, checking the ethos of manifest destiny, but it has consistently refused the responses of mourning, nostalgia, and the restriction of the self to a receptive role. The imagination cannot be satisfied for long with what Gary Snyder has promoted as "the real work": "washing and sighing, / sliding by" (227). There was a time in American poetry when expansiveness and new beginnings were easier to celebrate. Emerson, Whitman, even early Williams might claim to move out with no past at their back into a receding horizon. "The health of the eye seems to demand a horizon," wrote Emerson ("Nature" 1830), who could count on finding one. But for most moder and contemporary poets the debris of the past (material and imaginative) is strewn on the path and piling up on the horizon. The expansive poetry that interests me here concerns a reckoning with human extrava- gance in a world drawn down from its Romantic proportions, a world worn with human use and "littered with correspondences," rather than inflated by them. Fictions of nature as a primal Other or even a numinous presence are receding as poets turn to the indissoluble mixture of gray and green in which we live. The re- linquishment of human constructions is neither a possible nor a desirable response to this diminishment.3 Our favorite modern</page><page sequence="4">572 Modern Nature and Poetic Response "nature poet," Robert Frost, refused the modernist displacement of nature with art, asserting in "Birches" that "Earth's the right place for love" (117). Yet he recognized how greatly that "love" was involved in the selective construction of its object. Even though the grand, authorizing alterity of Nature is dismantled, a contested, conceptually unstable referent nonetheless remains. We do not live in an entirely artificial environment, a mere simu- lacrum or hyperreality. Besides the evolutionary sense in which all man's enterprise is "natural," there is the local sense in which nature (what is not designed or intended by man or determined by technology) constantly intrudes within the constructed scene, to regenerate itself or subvert our constructions with its own su- perfluencies. In this perspective "nature" may be sensed as some- thing at the margins or between the seams of or even as a force within our world, rather than as a place alternative to it, a retreat or respite from the agitation of the social condition, or even as a superseding context in which we operate. Not only Frost but other modern poets interested in the mediations of language and culture that inform our relation to the natural world-diverse poets such as Wallace Stevens, John Ashbery, Derek Walcott, Jorie Graham, and Charles Wright-and innovative "natural- ists" versed in the languages of history and science, such as Amy Clampitt and Ammons, have more to tell us about the possibili- ties for our relation to nature than do the latter-day Romanti- cists, primitivists, and "poets of place" and mystical presence who are usually celebrated by ecologically oriented critics. Poetry, of course, has none of the direct impact on the envi- ronment that roads, construction projects, or consumer trash piles do. But as they indulge their creative superfluities, Frost, Stevens, and other modern poets are not tempted by an easy distinction of spiritual and material economies. They make the connection between their excessive urge to construct and recon- struct through words and through other forms of human super- fluity. Poetry, especially American poetry, is a supreme expres- sion of humanity's urge to form and its restless, superfluous will to reform or trope. Such fecundity is problematic but not easily relinquished. The purging and renewing functions of superfluity may be compromised by the accumulating residue. But without apologizing for its superfluity or confining it to a redemptive ethical function, we might recognize some ways that poetry operates in tension with modern environmental con- ditions that trouble us. First, the very attention to backup and despoliation may encourage an openness to new channels of su- perfluous energy, revolts against systems of production that are breaking down into stasis. In the poets that interest me here, im-</page><page sequence="5">American Literary History ages of nature often provide emblems of such revolts rather than escapes. Second, by addressing a nature in our midst, not just a remote or lost nature, these poets stimulate an active desire to make that immediate world one we might love rather than abhor. As William Carlos Williams suggested in "To Elsie," we have conceived the ground under our feet as the excrement of some sky, while the imagination chases after deer going by fields of goldenrod. But whereas Williams called for a new authenticity of "contact" the poets that interest me here recognize mediation- historical, linguistic, and material-as inevitable. It is part of that ground under our feet. The residue of our constructions be- comes part of the change that is ever upon humans and nature, part of what the new "idea" of nature might be. Poetry develops within its own history, of course, but it also reflects the broader concerns and changes of the culture. The field of ecocriticism in particular has evolved to exhibit the link between literature and environmental ethics. Ecocriticism re- sponds to a large body of what it calls "environmental writing," defending it against the tendency of poststructuralism to reduce "nature" to an imaginative or ideological construct:4 "Ecocriti- cism proffers an environmental philosophy that declares the pri- macy of the physical world that forms the basis of the construct [of nature]. No ideas but in things" (Scheese 9). One assents eas- ily enough to such a principle; modern science ascribes to it. But once the word "primacy" is made the ground of cultural values as well as epistemological claims, the construct itself has come into play as an assumption, a primacy. The "pastoral impulse" forgets the artifice that goes into the pastoral world. Environ- mentalism was an aesthetic and spiritual movement long before it was a scientific movement (Picot 1-10). The historicizing of our ideas of nature (what it means for us, what we find beautiful in it) has implication as well for environmental ethics. "Could it be," wrote W. H. Auden in "Bucolics," "that the Lake District is another bourgeois invention like the piano?" (qtd. in Fitter 2). Such historicizing does not abolish nature as a referent, only a particular construction of nature and a new landscape aesthetic. It recognizes the historicity of the Romantic model of nature and invites different aesthetic and spiritual considerations, and con- sequently, different ethical considerations. Ecocriticism is a new, evolving approach, however, and its discourse is becoming more sophisticated. Though he privileges the Thoreauvian model, Buell offers, in The Environmental Imag- ination: Thoreau, Nature Writing, and the Formation of American Culture (1995), an account of environmental writing that is sensi- tive to its various tropes and strategies and to the rhetorical char- ... by addressing a nature in our midst, not just a remote or lost nature, these poets stimulate an active desire to make that immediate world one we might love rather than abhor. 573</page><page sequence="6">574 Modern Nature and Poetic Response acter of the "nature" underlying "pastoral ideology." Most prom- ising is the collaborative work recently headed by William Cronon, which resulted in the book Uncommon Ground: Rethink- ing the Human Place in Nature (1995).5 Here historians, cultural critics, ecologists, and others draw upon the insights of postmod- ern theory but operate within an environmental perspective. They explore the interrelations of cultural and natural phenom- ena without an assumption of "primacy" or fixed priority. Na- ture is investigated not as a refuge from or moral guide for orga- nized society, but as something we know only in our relation to it, as our environment and as an expression of ourselves, so that to give "primacy" to that world becomes meaningless. The essays recognize that we construct the natures to which we address our- selves, that these constructions are various and changing, and that they never fully coincide with the physical world. Rather than a holistic view of our relation to environment, these essays tend to represent an ironic view, in which our various concepts of nature conflict or become disrupted. This position, while rela- tively new in environmental theory, has been alive in modern American poetry for a long time. Ecocriticism has approached literature as the articulation of an environmental philosophy. Not surprisingly, then, it has often favored an agenda-driven nonfictional prose over poetry, which insists on the formal mediation of its themes and state- ments. But it is that very foregrounding of its acts of imagination that makes poetry a particularly rich medium for considering how we construct our ideas of nature and our relation to it. Whether they are interested in "subject matter" (as Stevens said of Frost) or "bric-a-brac" (as Frost retorted of Stevens), poets draw us into the drama of their configurations and make us aware of the workings and limits of metaphor and symbol. Po- etry makes visible the difference words and images can make to how we apprehend the world. A rhetorically oriented criticism is aware of the text (and indeed all mediating forms) less as a state- ment about reality than as a series of motivated strategies and structures that communicates to an audience or makes some- thing happen imaginatively. A rhetorical criticism does not nec- essarily lead to a thesis about the primacy of the imagination, mind, or culture, as ecocriticism has charged (Bate 6-7; Kroeber 37-39). It can, rather, reveal the entanglement of nature and cul- ture; the interplay between our desires, our concepts, and our perceptions; and possibilities for renewal and vitality within that entanglement. That vitality, in poetry, is of the imagination and necessarily abstract. But abstraction does not necessarily imply hostility,</page><page sequence="7">American Literary History 575 evasion, or alienation; more often, it involves an interplay with substance, both aesthetic and intellectual. Abstraction can be nourished and influenced, made flexible and dynamic, by that which it abstracts, and can draw us toward the natural world rather than away from it. Abstraction cannot renew itself; it needs a stimulus, a fluent resource. A poetics of superfluity loves change and flux and finds the image and stimulus to change in the fluency, even superfluency, of the physical world. Instead of an organic fusion of word into substance (attempted by Gary Snyder, for instance, and by Seamus Heaney in his early books), the poets of superfluity express a self-conscious abstraction that remains tied to environment in a "love" (Frost's term from "The Figure a Poem Makes" [778]) that pitches in to commitments, formal, conceptual, emotional. Here the role of poetry is not to forward an environmental agenda but to encourage this love ab- straction has for its source and object, a love that inevitably has some violence in it but that may nevertheless, in other arenas of human purpose, lead to acts that materially support the wildness and abundance of what is loved. My purpose here is not so much to demonstrate this nonliterary effect as to present a conceptual- ization of nature that emphasizes fluency and models human purpose on it. Indeed, the poet, in identifying with the dynamic, aggressive, and generative impulses of nature, its tendency to re- locate, move in, fill space, disrupt what has been erected, may invite an alliance with those processes against those immobilities of culture that obstruct creative ongoing. This kind of indirect ethics may sound like humanist abstraction and may not satisfy the urgency of the environmentalist, but it regards the distinct role of art in society without reducing art's role to aesthetics alone. In poetry human expansiveness expresses itself in formal and imaginative fecundity. The Romantic invention of an infinite, timeless, spiritualized nature opened a depth into which that po- etic superfluity could pour itself, the "something evermore about to be" (Wordsworth 608). But what place does it have in the di- minished, designified, and depthless nature of the modern age? One answer is nature's seasonal proliferation and sloughing off. Modernism turned, briefly, to a concentrated rather than expan- sive lyric energy, a poetics of efficiency that tied language to ne- cessity through "objectification." But the expansive energies of lyric poetry persisted alongside this aesthetic of restraint and can be felt both thematically and formally in a number of contempo- rary poets. Elegy, grieving over lost or declining places, has been another persistent route for lyric superfluity before diminished nature, but when the principle of consolation-natural continu-</page><page sequence="8">576 Modern Nature and Poetic Response ity-becomes the object of mourning, the recursive element de- feats the entrepreneurial spirit of American poetry, which has thrived on its speculation in new forms. The poets I will consider here-Robert Frost, Wallace Stevens, Amy Clampitt, A. R. Am- mons-have the evidence of superfluity and diminution before them, not the solution. But rather than lament the incursion of human structures and definitions as a diminution of the "wilder- ness" of original nature, these poets take modern conditions of representation as a starting point, the terms of their relation to nature, which is changed by its own, as well as our, superfluity. The nature we experience is inseparable from the cultural ar- rangements that add themselves to it, but those arrangements are always under siege from within and without. Early in the century poets began to recognize how much the nature to which they addressed themselves was a product of their own desires and assumptions. This was sometimes experi- enced as a triumph of art, at other times a reduction of the given to the merely made. But American poetry remained vigorously dialectical in its sense of the mind's engagement with the world. We see this especially in the poetry of Frost and Stevens. Their rhetorical strategies are motivated by this sense of the slipperi- ness of opposition. Irony, paradox, and other parallel and recip- rocal structures (zeugma, chiasmus, antithesis) become major means of entertaining distinction while resisting the mind's will to fix a primacy or establish firm boundaries in the relation be- tween the human and natural worlds. And for every perceived diminishment decried in the statements of the poems, one finds a counterthrust of expansion present in the formal and linguistic elements of the poems-a contest between what the poem says and what it does that adjusts, finally, our sense of what it says. So while the early part of the century offered a repudiation of Romantic terms of expansion, it did not give up on expansion altogether, leaving us merely with "nothing that is not there" (Stevens 8). The "nothing that is" turned out to be fertile ground. Rejecting modernism's withdrawal into abstraction and its preoccupation with urban experience, Frost seemed to carry for- ward pastoral ideals of human harmony with nature. But there was as much Andrew Marvell (whom T. S. Eliot celebrated for his "urbanity") as Wordsworth in Frost's idylls. A generation of critics has now attended to Frost's modernity, especially to his skepticism about Romantic idealities and his cautious engage- ment of metaphor as a tool of human understanding. We can also recognize Frost's modernity (as distinct from modernism) in his representation of nature as a space framed and divided by man, in which enclosure is our first, not our belated, experience</page><page sequence="9">American Literary History 577 of environment. John Elder has celebrated Frost as the exem- plary poet of "return to nature," his "directive" leading "back out of all this now too much for us, / Back in a time made simple by the loss of detail," but Elder ignores, among other things, the residual layers of cultural myth and iconography that structure that "intimacy with the earth" and the poem's distinction be- tween memory and experience in terms of the "loss of detail" (Elder 707-08). (Detail, we might remember, is for Frost one of those things that prevents us from submitting passively to static idealities.) This complex interdependence of identity between man and "the land" is apparent in much of late Frost, particu- larly in the reciprocal possessives of "The Gift Outright" (Frost 316). The poem begins in a counterintuitive assertion that dis- lodges notions of primacy: "The land was ours before we were the land's." Frost means by this not that we had to give up the anthropomorphic vision, partake of an aesthetics of relinquish- ment, or surrender to the primacy of nature, only that we had to replace a Eurocentric with an American cultural practice. To become "the land's" we had to exercise our own superfluity upon it, in deeds not only of human blood (sacrificing others as well as ourselves), but also of story, art, and other enhancements. We became the land's by excess, not by reduction. A compass set in an urban culture points to Frost's pastoral scenes in North of Boston (1914). So "Mending Wall" (Frost 39), the first poem in the volume, begins with human boundaries. But if culture is the mode of superfluity in "The Gift Outright," this poem identifies that mode with nature. Nature's presence is hard to locate, spatially, in the poem. It is not on either side of the wall, since these define entirely domesticated, contained spaces, identified with their owners ("he is all pine and I am apple or- chard"). Nature is best identified with super-fluency, with the "something that doesn't love a wall" and so knocks it down, a force rather than a space, more verb, as it "sends the frozen ground-swell" and "spills the upper boulders," than noun. But even here we have negative definition. Spatially nature is known in the "gaps" it makes in walls, gratuitous rather than utilitarian gaps, the poet reminds us. To use the word "nature" is in itself to fill the gap as Frost refuses to do. This "something" is not a knowable, therefore not a nameable essence or common ground. The imagery of magic and elves, and the implicit pun on the poet's own name in the subversive frost that upheaves the wall, stand in for this ineffability. But like a reverse of the machine in the garden, the incursive presence of this "something" is clearly felt, not a wilderness but a wildness (which does not, like wilder- ness, require an illusion of originary nature or a distinction from</page><page sequence="10">578 Modern Nature and Poetic Response humanity). Indeed, the wall is what allows this "something" to express itself. This erosion of boundary does not suggest Roman- tic continuity-the unity of humanity and nature under a meta- physical light. The modern principle of discontinuity rather than holism is alive precisely in the word "gaps." If there is a primal condition invoked in the poem, it is not nature but the apparently primordial human order that the neighbor would sustain, "like an old-stone savage armed." He is the conservationist. Nature is redrawn as gratuitously subversive, a secondary energy or wild- ness that asserts itself within and against static forms, especially forms of ownership and exclusion. This, too, is one of the "fig- ure[s] a poem makes." The speaker of the poem clearly sees these "gaps" as an expression of an impulse within himself, a violence in him that resists boundaries: "Spring is the mischief in me." But Frost's imagination operates between the speaker and his neighbor, recognizing that the "game" requires two players that superfluity runs between them, between the first, arbitrary erection of a wall "there, where it is we do not need a wall" and the gratuitous dismantling that brings them annually together to restore it. The erasure of human boundaries to uncover some primal, undivided space to which we might "return" or "retreat" is not an attainable or desirable goal. Instead boundaries with holes in them, permeable walls, give us the sense of the wild. Elder characterizes Frost in terms of a hard pastoral, in which our oneness with nature involves a tragic sense of entropy (718). But it is hard to know what "oneness" can mean in the context of a general entropic drift that envelops even those meanings de- signed to counter it. This is surely an abysmal kind of oneness, not conducive to environmental action. But the stronger prin- ciple is not entropy but the superfluity that thrives on it, that is active rather than passive. Entropy, for this poet as for many oth- ers, is also opportunity. In this case the poet has allied himself with the forces of superfluity in nature that subvert and thus con- tribute to the undoing of cultural structures. It is this unrestricted sense of superfluity that establishes the kind of "economy" such poetry entertains. In "The Exposed Nest" (Frost 106) from Mountain Interval (1916), nature's hypothetical innocence has been destroyed by "too much world" and the superfluity of human attention has become a threat. But the poems of this volume of "interval" ex- perience concern themselves less with lament over nature's lost grandeur or purity than with what to make of the world that remains. This is the question framed in "The Oven Bird," which presents not only a distinctly impermanent nature, but also one considerably marked by the presence of man:</page><page sequence="11">American Literary History 579 There is a singer everyone has heard, Loud, a mid-summer and a mid-wood bird, Who makes the solid tree trunks sound again. He says that leaves are old and that for flowers Mid-summer is to spring as one to ten. He says the early petal-fall is past When pear and cherry bloom went down in showers On sunny days a moment overcast; And comes that other fall we name the fall. He says the highway dust is over all. The bird would cease and be as other birds But that he knows in singing not to sing. The question that he frames in all but words Is what to make of a diminished thing. (Frost 116) As many readers have observed, the oven bird is out to dis- burden us of any vestigial Romanticism. But modernism's gen- eral disillusion is also inadequate. "Other birds" include both the prudent realists and the dreamy transcendentalists. Finding nothing to celebrate in this season, other modern birds have "ceased" intoning. And even John Keats's nightingale, which "[s]ingest of summer in full-throated ease" (370), flies away when there is nothing more to sing about. This common bird, which nests on the ground, finds a song in nature's finitude. It will voice matters of actuality and make a poetry of these. But within an apparent rhetoric of relinquished ideals, Frost finds a new ampli- tude and a new outlet for his superfluity. This is not a poem of grief or rage, nor of hard-nosed realism, nor even of present veri- ties. It is a poem of entrepreneurial challenge and rechanneled expansion. Frost refutes his Romantic precursors substantively and sty- listically. He tells us what time it is (he tells us time exists, that the bliss of presentness is an illusion). His declamatory bird does not sing, nor promise access to a translinguistic, transsocial, lyric, or natural truth. It says, repeatedly says, the same thing, what everyone has heard, without embellishments or circumlo- cutions, without rhapsodic rhythms that might extend the mean- ing out into a consummate plot. Frost's personification of nature does not invite a consummate relation to it either. The poet speaks of the bird in third person, refusing apostrophe. The dis- continuity between bird and humanity, the fiction of nature's voice, is further acknowledged at the end. What the bird "says" it says in "all but words" whereas the poet has nothing but words with which to convey it. The oven bird's directness is qualified, then, by the fact of translation.6 The bird not only frames a ques-</page><page sequence="12">580 Modern Nature and Poetic Response tion but is himself a frame. This temporally measured, mediated, rhetorically determined nature is part of the diminishment of Ro- mantic proportions that Frost wants to address. Nature is not an escape from human excess. "The highway dust is overall." Lawrence Buell, in his discussion of personification in The Environmental Imagination (180-219), suggests that modernity permits the trope through a distinction between epistemological and ethical impulses. While epistemology may resist personifica- tion as anthropocentricism, we can employ it pragmatically for the ethical result, recognizing nature not just as an object but as a presence. Whether that sense of "presence" is source or conse- quence of the trope is not the issue. Such an epistemologically ungrounded ethics evolves from desire rather than truth. In the case of "The Oven Bird," however, the personification is moti- vated by literary tradition rather than a desire for intimacy with nature. It comments on all personification, choosing birdsong as the classic example of giving "voice to nature." But while the oven bird does not retain its autonomy as a thing of nature, it does offer an opportunity for the poet to invent and thus distin- guish himself from the past. Frost refuses apostrophe because he knows that his reciprocity with nature is really a reciprocity between his observational and imaginative faculties, which de- velop and check each other. This reciprocity is part of the drive to new form and in this sense is as much an expression of expan- sive energy as of acknowledged diminishment. (Apostrophe, he implies, no longer functions as a mode of expansion.) Frost does not trade in the optimal energies of Romanticism for a modern minimalism, however. Repetition in Frost's style becomes a form of superfluity, as it is nature's. The facts of nature, as of this poem, are redundant but proliferate. Frost chooses the heavily recursive and framed form of the sonnet over the rhapsodic curve of the ode, but he finds plenty of room for new soundings within these limits. Furthermore, there is nothing sterile or self- canceling about the echoes, reversals, and repetitions of "The Oven Bird." In this sense it provides an instructive contrast to another bird, Thomas Hardy's turn-of-the-century "darkling thrush" (Hardy 35). The diminishment declaimed in "The Oven Bird" might suggest a continuation of Hardy's "death-lament," in which a withered nature, closed off from metaphysical extension, reflects the withered hopes of man and his paralysis in a godless and god-cursed universe. Here the "kinship" is one of mutual re- duction. Hardy's poem anticipates Frost's in its refusal of apos- trophe and ode. As "the century's deathbed" the landscape offers no grounding of figurative energies in Romantic correspondence</page><page sequence="13">American Literary History 581 or even belated ideas of presence. The poet's lyric energy turns in on itself (brilliantly) as a blight of self-canceling puns and images: I leant upon a coppice gate When Frost was spectre-gray, And Winter's dregs made desolate The weakening eye of day, The tangled bine-stems scored the sky Like strings of broken lyres, And all mankind that haunted nigh Had sought their household fires. (35) Repetition of sound and image create a mirror between the poet and the landscape. Hardy "leant upon a coppice gate" toward a landscape that is a "corpse outleant" in the second stanza. Musi- cal "scores" are scored and lyres are liars. In the stanzas that follow the thrush emerges as an alternative direction for lyric energy, but inaccessible to the poet. The discontinuities of think- ing and feeling, seeing and hearing, leave Hardy with a critically unresolved rather than adjusted sense of nature and human prospect. Frost's midsummer nature, as distinct from Keats's spring or Hardy's winter, provokes neither rhapsodic expansion nor self- canceling despair, but rather a reckoning of his betweenness. He is not only between seasons, he is also between nature and cul- ture, a product of their entanglement. Within that new locus the poet finds considerable outlet for his superfluous energy and con- siderable evidence of the same energy in nature. What seems like a call for reduction and relinquishment, a submission to the tragic fact of entropy, is really an amplification. Are rhetoric and statement at odds? Not completely, but the rhetoric instructs us how to reconceive the statement. The oven bird will sing "[l]oud" of diminishment and imaginative proliferations. Frost's inventiveness with this new trope of amplification is part of his originality, what makes this commonsense bird "that everyone has heard" stand out from the crowd of Romantic indi- vidualists. Where Hardy's puns cancel meaning, Frost's supple- ment it. So he "makes the solid tree trunks sound again," resub- stantiating a nature once etherealized as Romantic symbol yet doubling it as sense and sound against modern reductions. The material world still resonates in the mental world. Repetition seems to reinforce meaning, but it also loosens meaning, so that things are unfixed rather than tethered in time and place. "Mid- summer" and "mid-wood" are relative terms, refusing the Ro-</page><page sequence="14">582 Modern Nature and Poetic Response mantic and modernist preoccupation with origins and ends (while evoking Dante on middle age). "Fall" takes on many ex- plicit and implied meanings so that insistent sound accompanies ambiguous sense. Frost is not such a plain speaker as he pretends to be. Buell has pointed out that environmental writing often reminds us of the artifice involved in the designation of seasonal boundaries (219-51). Here multiple "falls" check the autumnal mood. The multiplicity of "falls" turns entropy into superfluity. The superimposing of the seasons similarly adds as it subtracts, thickening description as the present dissipates. The couplet, which ordinarily closes a sonnet, here appropriately occurs in the middle so that diminution and closure do not coincide and the question at the end ("what to make of a diminished thing") can- not be answered. Frost's countdown is also a count up; enumeration, with repetition, contributes to volume. If number is the language of finitude, it is also the language of poetry. And here the poem abounds in paradox. When Frost announces in a decasyllabic line that "mid-summer is to spring as one to ten" the theme of diminishment competes with syntactic and syllabic increase. While the polysyllabic word "mid-summer" represents diminu- tion, the monosyllabic word "spring" represents excess, and yet the two numerals "one" and "ten" are both monosyllabic. This is not a self-canceling but a dynamic ratio, in which the superflu- ous imagination reformulates its approach to nature. The near double negatives in the poem work similarly to trump negation, as in "the bird would cease and be as other birds / but that he knows in singing not to sing." The bird who "knows" his "no's" is not silenced by them, for to refuse to cease from not singing is to relinquish nothing. All this may be so much highway dust, a stylistic amplitude designed to cover up an impoverished reality. But for the mod- ern poet transport is by highway only, which both literally and figuratively defines the frame through which we encounter the natural world. More importantly, the poet is able to "make" something of this, not just make sense of it emotionally or episte- mologically, but create something, as his superfluous energy pro- vokes him to do. "Hyla Brook," as a partner poem to "The Oven Bird," rein- forces this arousal of creative superfluity before diminished but proliferating nature. Just as the oven bird is distinguished from "other birds" of Romantic legacy, so this brook is "other far" from those abiding, brotherly rivers (especially Wordsworth's syl- van Wye in "Tintern Abbey" [1798]), that flow through literary tradition. But again, there is more involved in this poem than a</page><page sequence="15">American Literary History 583 repudiation of Romanticism. As in "The Oven Bird," Frost seeks out new terms of expansion and images that expansion in na- ture's own superfluities: By June our brook's run out of song and speed. Sought for much after that, it will be found Either to have gone groping underground (And taken with it all the Hyla breed That shouted in the mist a month ago, Like ghost of sleigh-bells in a ghost of snow)- Or flourished and come up in jewel-weed, Weak foliage that is blown upon and bent Even against the way its waters went. Its bed is left a faded paper sheet Of dead leaves stuck together by the heat- A brook to none but who remember long. This as it will be seen is other far Than with brooks taken otherwhere in song. We love the things we love for what they are. (115-16) Wordsworth may change, but his sylvan Wye thrives on, a per- manent symbol that helps him overcome his own loss through time. But while Wordsworth's memory is confirmed by nature's forms, Hyla is "a brook to none but who remember long," for it disappears by early summer. Superfluity may not be a term to describe this minimal brook, out of song and speed by June. But the evidence of natural superfluity is all around it, and the re- sponse to it can certainly be called superfluous. Between the mat- ter-of-fact reduction of the first line and the call to relinquish idealities in the last run two elaborating sentences, describing natural superfluities, that give considerable play to the poet's rhe- torical powers and push the sonnet over to a superfluous fif- teenth line. That line confirms the double realism heard through- out "The Oven Bird." A sentimental realism asks us to embrace nature in its diminishment, relinquishing tropes and idealities. But this is not Frost's sense, if we allow the rhetoric of the poem to inform its sense. A more complex realism factors in the super- fluous associations and memories that amplify and transfigure nature. The superfluity is figured first merely as memory and ab- sence, a ghostly superimposition of multiple absences. But the flourishing, exorbitantly named "jewel-weed" images Frost's own flowering into speech. That flourishing speech is also "weak," bent against the water's way, reminding us perhaps that this po- etic superfluity does not correspond to nature even if nature is its stimulus. It tropes or turns from nature, just as nature turns</page><page sequence="16">584 Modern Nature and Poetic Response on itself. Indeed, nature has become little more than a "faded paper sheet," no longer a grounding of emotional truth. On this diminished surface, however, a future can be written. "This as it will be seen," Frost oddly comments toward the end of his poem, is a new kind of brook, a new kind of poem. We find in Frost, then, a negotiation between the aesthetics of relinquishment and the aesthetics of superfluity. Plain speak- ing masks clever troping, and matter-of-factness leaves room for imaginative soundings. All this is in keeping with an idea of na- ture that allows a distinction but not an isolation of the human and the natural, as well as a will to identify or figure in nature the same impulse to proliferation and expansion, in the face of diminishment, that he feels in himself. Frost's contemporary Wallace Stevens tended, in his early career at least, to carry on more a debate over than a negotiation between these two impulses. The outspoken "inchling" in "Ban- tams in Pine Woods" (1922) who "bristles in these pines" of Georgia scolds the "portly Azcan" for his inflations (Stevens 60). One can hear the sermonizing Thoreau of Walden (1854) and his environmentalist heirs in this inchling as he addresses the "damned universal cock" who enslaves nature, "as if the sun / Was blackamoor to bear your blazing tail." Relinquishment, of raiment and of self, is the order of the day, he says, prescribing a diet of necessity: "Fat! Begone!" The portly Stevens was certainly sensitive to such hectoring (which is, of course, his own). He allows the Chieftain his due, and is rightly associated with his superfluities, yet Stevens has the modern poet's sobering knowl- edge of the residual condition of his superfluity. Wallace Stevens's early winter landscape in "The Snow Man" ([1921]; Stevens 8) is much more (or less) than Frost's faded paper sheet. It recalls Lear's heath, without making Lear's complementary case for superfluity. This sublime whiteness com- pels the poet to relinquish his ego and its anthropomorphisms in return for a glamorous objectivity in nature. Such reductions offer relief from the sensory overload and stylistic superfluity of other early poems such as "The Comedian as the Letter C" (1922). The seasons in Stevens always express the turning of his own mind as it proliferates and sheds images and forms. (One could not have a "mind of winter" about spring, therefore.) In this sense relinquishment and superfluity are aspects of a larger cycle rather than rivaling aesthetics. But even in "The Snow Man" superfluity is present: in the "junipers shagged with ice," in the "spruces rough in the distant glitter of the January sun," and in the repetition and tautology at the end of the poem, in which multiple negatives become positives: "nothing himself ...</page><page sequence="17">American Literary History 585 nothing that is not ... nothing that is." The later Stevens, having seen so many creative seasons come and go, addresses himself more directly to the superfluity that drives such seasonal changes. The various seasons carry within them the fact of sea- sonality. In Parts of a World (1942) Stevens frequently parodies the urge to reduction that attracted him in Harmonium (1923). The poet of The Rock (1950) has displaced an aesthetics of purity with an aesthetics of poverty. This poet, of a muddy world, smudged beyond cleansing with human association, more truly meets Frost's challenge to make something of a diminished world. In "The Plain Sense of Things" (1952) Stevens, like Frost, makes more than plain sense of it: After the leaves have fallen, we return To a plain sense of things. It is as if We had come to an end of the imagination, Inanimate in an inert savoir. It is difficult even to choose the adjective For this blank cold, this sadness without cause. The great structure has become a minor house. No turban walks across the lessened floors. The greenhouse never so badly needed paint. The chimney is fifty years old and slants to one side. A fantastic effort has failed, a repetition In a repetitiousness of men and flies. Yet the absence of the imagination had Itself to be imagined. The great pond, The plain sense of it, without reflections, leaves, Mud, water like dirty glass, expressing silence Of a sort, silence of a rat come out to see, The great pond and its waste of lilies, all this Had to be imagined as an inevitable knowledge, Required, as a necessity requires. (423) Stevens's later nature, as many critics have observed, exists in close proximity to the city. In "The Plain Sense of Things" the pond at Elizabeth Park replaces Thoreau's Walden (the "great pond") to remind us that the "fantastic effort" of Romanticism "has failed." But that Romantic idea of nature was itself not na- ture but a "great structure" or construction, something human. Stevens's imperial Romantic, Hoon, "walks across the lessened</page><page sequence="18">586 Modern Nature and Poetic Response floors," the "lessons" of modern existence having reduced his Pa- laz to a "minor house." Nature must be reimagined, since "the greenhouse never so badly needed paint." "Need" is a misleading term here, however, since it is the superfluity of human and natu- ral creativity that stimulates change. Thoreau would strip down all superfluity and discover only the truth of necessity. Stevens recognizes in Thoreau's impulse to reduction a last nostalgia. Lyric superfluity is already bubbling up in the first stanza of the poem through the superfluous language and negative intensifi- cation ("in ... in ... in") with which Stevens describes the imagi- nation, "inanimate in an inert savoir." Stevens turns from the ele- giac mood as an outlet for his lyric energy. Loss and longing are not the only roles for the imagination, and the "waste" of the lilies suggests the opposite of barrenness. Like Frost, Stevens reorients the poet through an earth- bound, unidealizing surrogate. The "rat come out to see" is not a visionary, not even a personification. Its angle of vision does not allow the wide prospect of the elevated Romantic beholder, but a nearly horizontal perspective, in which imagination and reality become so close as to be indistinguishable. This is evi- dently not the rat that appears in Eliot's The Waste Land (1922), a leftover from the trenches ("a rat crept softly through the vegetation / dragging its slimy belly on the bank" [lines 187-88]). Eliot's poem suggests an antipastoral withdrawal from nature. "The river's tent is broken" and the pastoral world has departed with its nymphs. But Paul Alpers has read Stevens's rat as a lat- ter-day pastoral figure, the sign of renewal entering the poem of waste (307). There is a new kind of harmony in this muddy real- ity where nature and culture slide together, a repetitiousness of men and flies. This nature includes the "waste of lilies" and the waste of words as part of what it is. The imagination (superfluity) finds a role for itself and identifies with nature (necessity) in its production of waste. "Necessity" in this poem is a floating signi- fier, not only calling us back to the "need" of the house for paint, and, conversely, to the reduction of imagination to the "blank cold" of things as they are, without the ornaments of metaphor, but also calling us forward to the poem's logical turn toward imagination again, as an unimagined nature is by definition (by logical "necessity") an imagined one. The representation of di- minishment is in itself a superfluity. Beside these nimble and courageous reckonings with mod- ern landscape of Frost and Stevens, the protests against moder- nity formed in images of an idealized past and imposed on the present in various primitivist visions can be terribly unsatisfying. Gary Snyder seems altogether embarrassed by active conscious-</page><page sequence="19">American Literary History 587 ness, including metaphor, asking us to settle instead for a combi- nation of presentational and didactic modes. He would have us, paradoxically, become "native" again. Snyder's poems do much, admittedly, to awaken our admiration for the vast spaces of the Sierras, and Wendell Berry charms us with his sacramental mar- riage to enduring place, carried on through his subsistence farm- ing in Kentucky. For them such places have essences that can provide identity and continuity to those who dwell in them. But these are not the places where most of us live or will live in the future. There are, however, other American poets of nature, less celebrated by ecocriticism, who have responded to the places we live in, creating dynamic landscapes entangled with human pres- ence and purpose, but also transformed by natural events. These poets have heard the oven bird's challenge and formulated cre- ative new answers about what to make of a nature covered in highway dust, a nature experienced secondarily, through its re- calcitrance toward human systems and standards. Like Stevens, they have recognized a new connection with nature based on su- perfluity, and in an aesthetics of entropy and transfiguration, as well as of nomadic movement and dispersal, replace the former spatial associations of nature as presence and permanence. Their poems are cannily aware that the nature to which they address themselves is selective, that it emerges in many ways as a sound- ing of impulses or desires within the self rather than a surren- dering of the self to the nonhuman. But this sounding occurs in connection with a lived landscape, not merely in imagination. What particularly oppresses these poets is immobility, the kind of stubborn dogma and walling in or walling out advocated by Frost's neighbor in "Mending Wall." As enemies of restricted ideas and hardened attitudes such poets as Stevens, Clampitt, and Ammons make odd environmentalists-they may adopt a didactic manner at times, but their rhetoric is self-conscious, in- specting propositions rather than writing prescriptions. The eth- ics of superfluity may be inherently unstable in this way. Nor do they overtly deplore the uglier signs of human superfluity, since such distaste is itself a way that civilization distances itself from its own effects. Nevertheless, these poets are worth considering within an environmental debate, not only because they revise our conception of nature, but also because they entertain the aes- thetic possibilities of a nature that is in our midst and thus draw our affections to it.7 Amy Clampitt is often described as a "naturalist" and ad- mired for her wonderfully detailed descriptions. Her critique of American exploitation of land and lives and her own celebration</page><page sequence="20">588 Modern Nature and Poetic Response of wild things as they resist domestication make her a plausible subject for the "ecologically oriented" critic. But the real objects of Clampitt's adversary energies are not domestications and con- structions or even the struggle for domination, but stasis, mono- culture, and commodification. Like the nature she constructs, she is a "fanatic" and a "mobile opportunist," compulsively creating structures and abandoning them in a restless, fugitive motion. Like the "spruce" she "has no taproot" and develops a nomadic sense of place. She loves the fugitive things of nature that find a foothold in nonnative ground, that travel and adapt. The garden ideal, like the wilderness ideal, has little appeal for this poet, who admires the tenacious weeds that spring up everywhere and are never quite eradicated. What she loves about wild things is their affront to neatness and decorum. She goes out of her way to find aesthetic value where it cannot be commodified or exchanged for simulacra (calendar art, Disney parks, even poems). In this context Clampitt's poems on vacant lots-"Vacant Lot with Tumbleweed and Pigeons" (1985), "Vacant Lot with Pokeweed" (1990)-offer particularly interesting examples of this contem- porary pastoral. Again Eliot offers contrast: the "vacant lots" of his "Preludes" (1917), where old women gather sticks, suggest apocalyptic emptiness. For Clampitt, they are an opportunity to fill, especially in "Vacant Lot with Pokeweed": Tufts, follicles, grubstake biennial rosettes, a low- life beach-blond scruff of couch grass: notwithstanding the intermingled dregs of wholesale upheaval and dismemberment, weeds do not hesitate, the wheeling rise of the ailanthus halts at nothing-and look! here's a pokeweed, sprung from seed dropped by some vagrant, that's seized a foothold: a magenta- girded bower, gazebo twirls of blossom rounding into raw-buttoned, garnet-rodded fruit one more wayfarer</page><page sequence="21">American Literary History 589 perhaps may salvage from the season's frittering, the annual wreckage. (329) We might begin by considering the meaning of the word "va- cant" here. It has a double significance. On the one hand "vacant lot" suggests a contrast between human and natural "use." The scene is "vacant"-between human constructions-yet in natu- ral terms it is full. This fullness is not represented as the return to a primal condition so much as a natural opportunism, matched by the poet's own inventiveness, creating a pastoral landscape out of this scene of weeds and debris. For humans and nature alike this vacant lot is a "site" not an essential place. Na- ture here is parallel to the social, creative, and decreative world of humanity, but antithetical to its system of commodification, offering an alternative mode of circulation and exchange. The parodic character of the natural scene suggests resemblance to the energies that produce social orders. But there is a difference. In its alliance with nature's constructions it offers a counterex- ample to the economy of real estate (i.e., "we think this is a va- cancy, but look, it is not vacant but full") and implies the possi- bility for a mobility (lateral as much as vertical) unrealized in public life. On the one hand, nature in this poem represents an alternative use of the vacant lot. On the other hand, the ultimate focus of the poem is not on this alternative construct but on the general superfluous expenditure that overrides each of these uses. The first stanza gives us a sort of low-grade organizational vitality of "low-life" (in a social and a perspectival sense) couch grass-a rhizomatic rather than a vertical, rooted presence-of "grubstake" rosettes (like those "prospectors" borrowing sup- plies on the promise of returns), enterprising despite the appear- ance of negation in the "intermingling dregs / of wholesale up- heaval." There is a kind of defiant irony in the "rise of ailanthus" out of these dregs, the "tree of heaven" which stinks to high heaven. Clampitt is not just trumping Donald Trump. The scene suggests both an alternative cycle of exchange to one based on commodification (real estate) and a fable of the struggle toward dominance and the transience of all ascendancies. As Clampitt's vision roams around this disorganized or low organized space, this "vacant" lot, the eye settles on a focus that gives it a new definition and a place to invest lyric energy. Clampitt too is a prospector and discovers, or creates, a land- scape. The pokeweed has humble origins (its seed having passed</page><page sequence="22">590 Modern Nature and Poetic Response through a bird's gullet) but having "seized a foothold" (which is just what the poet's gaze-"and look!"-has done within the vacancy of the lot) it ascends to majesty with its regal "garnet- rodded" (sceptered) fruit. The pokeweed has transformed the va- cant lot into a "bower" with a "gazebo"-a hortus conclusus. But this is not the rhodora pleading its own excuse of beauty in a raging world, nor is it an example of the meek inheriting the earth. Another poet would stop with the pokeweed and senti- mentalize the survival of natural beauty out of cultural "wreck- age" or the ascendancy of "natural" aristocracy over that which is constructed. But Clampitt has no investment in preserving this particular arrangement. She has a "wariness of going along with anybody's program whatever" (Clampitt xviii). While the econ- omy of Clampitt's nature is not involved in commodification, it does suggest a structure of entrepreneurial expansion and obso- lescence, and it does, insofar as the poet designs it, become ab- stract. The "annual wreckage," "the season's frittering" is that of nature and culture alike. The poet returns her landscape to "the season's frittering" where it is broken into fragments and dissi- pated to make room for a new landscape vision, a new filling of the vacant lot. Whatever is "salvaged" (not monumental) is salvaged in a transfigured form, as a "wayfarer" (some vagrant bird) consumes the fruit and discards its waste elsewhere. By rep- resenting nature here as an entrepreneurial force that moves in when real estate moves out, Clampitt locates both nature and culture within a general superfluity, but this also allows her to create tension within the parallel, since the vagrant and wayfar- ing ways of these natural inhabitants are recalcitrant to the stan- dards of propriety and property. When the margin moves to the center, when a weed bed becomes a garden, it is a mark of super- fluency, not reverse hierarchy. There are considerable ethical risks that Clampitt runs in conceiving nature as an entrepreneurial force, which she does frequently. Tradition prefers to offer nature as an innocent space to be violated by man's exploitative enterprise or protected against it, a space of permanence or annihilation, not of transi- tion. Should she not deplore "wholesale upheaval and / dismem- berment" the way nineteenth-century poets deplored enclosure? She chooses, instead, to praise adaptability, and a superfluity that defies the division of the world into owned "lots." "Some- thing there is that doesn't / love a Third Avenue tenement," she writes in "Real Estate" ([1985]; 169). That "something" may be a human rather than a natural force, but it is not thereby dis- dained. She has little sympathy for "the Holdout tenants / ...</page><page sequence="23">American Literary History 591 gesticulating by storefronts ... adapted only to an anxious pres- ent" or the old pawnbroker dusting off her ancient umbrellas. Clampitt will not traffic in nostalgia, nor wax sentimental about the "birdcage" fire escape about to be torn down. It signifies en- trapment in attachment to place. Instead, the entrepreneur who rents a U-haul and carries all the pawvned stuff "off somewhere" wins her applause. She knows, as in "Progress at Building Site with (Fewer) Pigeons" (1987) that the constructions of the pres- ent, that will themselves become the cages of another time, are hard to recognize as home. But it is the concept of home that must be modified, as she learned from long reading of Eliza- beth Bishop. Clampitt-Quaker descendant, tenant advocate, McCarthy campaigner, refugee from the provincialisms and neighborly fences of Midwestern life-is sensitive to the damage of the en- trepreneurial energy when it involves the machinery of ownership and property, driving out what cannot pay or what cannot be priced. She relishes the unbrokerable life of nature as a kind of revenge on such restrictions. In "Kudzu Dormant" (1990), for instance, she admires the way nature slips out of the management of human enterprise and pursues its own superfluity. Much of her irony, like Frost's, is built upon such disruptions of the na- ture/culture boundary. Amidst the "debris of enterprise that's slipped / into the lap of yet another / annal of the poor" the "overdressed daffodil prospers," flagrantly, against all the nega- tions and rigid tastes of the civil world (283). The personification also allows that "the poor" themselves might enjoy a superfluous expenditure, rather than merely being superfluous, thrown in with the other waste products of the dominant culture, or mere sufferers of history's abuse, castoffs of a selective legacy. "Like the daffodil," kudzu presents a countercurrent of enterprise, a "rambunctious eyesore, / entrepreneur (as most are) / from away off somewhere." It is not part of an authentic Southern lineage of place, but a foreign "opportunist" like the mockingbird in an- other poem who is "ready to expand its range where / there's an opening." Clampitt enjoys praising kudzu as an outrage to proud roots and elevated tastes, like some makeshift circus: "ropes, pul- leys, shawls, / caparisons, tent curtains ... strung / above the raw, red-gulleyed / wintering hide of Dixie" (283). The poem offers an implied retort to the Fugitive poets and their natural aristocracy, those who would take their stand in the abiding cultural roots of agrarian Dixie, in retreat from the appalling drift of modernity. She knows that kudzu was brought in from Asia to enrich worn- out soil and protect against erosion and that it has exceeded</page><page sequence="24">592 Modern Nature and Poetic Response its use. (The quintessential Kentucky bluegrass was a similar im- port [Worcester 112].) As a "panacea rampant," it has become a "charming strangler" choking out the nostalgic charm of the plantation park it was supposed to revitalize. Clampitt chooses "on principle [to] . . . admire it green," a life form that will not be contained (283). The entrepreneurial spirit (as she construes it in nature) is for Clampitt an antidote to something much more threatening, the various forces against mobility, whether in ideal- ized "roots" that reject impurities, or the impersonal control and homogenization, whether in the name of laws, tastes, traditions, or class structures. While "wilderness" has little appeal as a concept (she pre- fers birds, weeds, common wildflowers, and rhyzomatic plants to Adirondack vistas or forests primeval), the waterways and shores (those superfluencies) get special attention from Clampitt. They are (in "Notes on the State of Virginia [1990]) "the wet brink of all our enterprise: the blur of bays, the / estuarial fog at sunrise, the glooms / and glimmerings, the tidal waters." If she observes that with our "straking smudge and smear" we have begun to "alter the face" of this presence "little by little," it is not clear that "enterprise" should or can cease, that the face should be immobile. But she awakens in us a desire that there always be an "opening in the foliage" an unconstructed, uncommodified space. Thus "the wet brink of all our enterprise" has a double sense, evoking both excitement and anxiety, opportunity and di- saster (339). In her parody of the pastoral elegy (and especially of John Milton's "Lycidas"), "The Reedbeds of the Hackensack" (1985), Clampitt relies on questions, some rhetorical, some unan- swered, to formulate her response to the dying New Jersey water- way. The question that she frames through the example of the reedbeds is the same Frost frames through his oven bird, "what to make of a diminished thing," and like him, she is not ready to settle for grief and rage. But in focusing on the reedbeds she finds in nature a trope for her own poetic response, one that refuses the fraudulent, high-toned lament of a society whose "civility" thrives on the very practices that have destroyed what it would mourn for, which turns its back on what it has despoiled and uses rhetoric to distance itself from its object. "What's landfill but the backside of civility?" (165). Culture tends to destroy its natural resources, then idealize them in memory. But to call land- fill the backside of civility is to refuse this dissociation. Clampitt settles in to consider "scummed maunderings that nothing loves but reeds' and writes a sestina (a mock-elegant form, but also the counterpart of recycling and regeneration) protesting the</page><page sequence="25">American Literary History 593 "fraudulent civility" and admiring the uncultivated reeds (with their "fluent purplings," "the rathe, the deathbed generations") as a "forsooth civility" from which she might draw more inspira- tion than from the "laureate hearse." She reminds us that this is not an antipoetic or pastoral of the low, a campy celebration of the "snugly ugly." Nor is hers an esthetique du mal. Just how far this "scrannel ruth" can take her she is not sure: Is there a poetry of the incorrigibly ugly, free of all furbishings that mark it fraudulent? When toxins of an up-against-the-wall civility have leached away the last patina of these reeds, and promised landfill, with its lethal asphodel of fumes... ? (165) "We love the things we love for what they are," as Frost said of "Hyla Brook," and what they are includes our poetic idealiza- tions and our memories, maybe even our despoliation. But Clampitt also imagines a point at which the landscape ceases to be even the "faded paper sheet" on which the imagination writes, a point that obstructs the superfluous power of the imagination, a brink of enterprise that has only a void on its other side. Like Clampitt, A. R. Ammons has often chosen familiar, local landscapes as his scenes, eschewing the rhapsodies of the exceptional and sublime for the various motions of the ongoing and the dizzying challenges of imagining the human place in it. Like Clampitt, Ammons has admired the "magnitude of use- lessness," the superfluities of the physical world, and identified his poetic energy with these. But where Clampitt's lyric energies are directed into the ethical and social, Ammons's are epistemo- logical and ontological. Ammons's poetry has a discursive aspect (he is often compared to Lucretius), yet he refuses to be "for" or "about" anything but the poem as an expression of his own on- going, attendant to the ongoing in the physical world. He is not, then, a poet of place. In his long poem "Strip" from Glare (1997), Ammons takes on the issue directly: I reject the North because it is not my native ground, and I reject the South because it rejected me, and I reject European clutterment because we fought to put that ocean between</page><page sequence="26">594 Modern Nature and Poetic Response us. I identify with no sort or kind: I am by myself; with me is the thinking up and the writing of this poem I am for the poem: it tells me who I am.... (74) "I haven't even been called an environmentalist," he writes. Yet if he is not a poet of place or an environmentalist, he might still be considered a "nature poet" in the sense that the "thinking up and writing of this poem" is regularly engaged with the ex- ample of nature. "A Sense of Now," the first poem of his recent volume Brink Road (1996), typifies the way Ammons imagines the landscape and schools the mind to its tumbling contours. "Rock frozen and fractured / spills, a shambles," leaving "a jumble, / 'metaphysical debris,"' but the mind/eye does not pause on the debris, but rather follows the stream as it finds new direc- tion, "becoming coherence" (3). Ecologically minded critics who have appreciated Ammons (Elder, Buell) tend to read him as a poet of entropy, but he clearly wishes to pitch in to those pro- cesses of erosion, not merely surrender to them. In many ways Ammons is an uncomfortable fit for environmental philosophy in its current form. He is, after all, the poet of "Plunder" (1970), almost cavalier in his exploitation of nature as trope. If, like Whitman, Ammons portrays his imperial self as a buffoon, creat- ing an ironic tension between material and imaginative appropri- ation, the emphasis is nevertheless on the human agent as an exploitative presence. The aesthetic of relinquishment has Am- mons surrendering ego in order to participate in a fluent nature (Buell 164-65). But in "Gravelly Run" (1965) the "surrendered self" finds no victors and remains isolated "among unwelcoming forms." Closeness to nature, the escape from the anthropocentric perspective, is a fiction. "Stranger, / hoist your burden, get on down the road" (Ammons, Collected 55). The road is the con- dition of our intercourse with nature and the highway dust is over all. But Ammons does not evade the underside of this vision of superfluity and transition when it is closer to the human world. Nor does it cause him to flinch from his own formulations, to withdraw them to a merely imaginary realm where they have less ethical import. Ammons's fascination with blighted places emerges early, and like Clampitt he is unwilling simply to deplore them. In "The City Limits" (1971) he set his imagination to the margin of human orders, where waste and debris pile up and trail</page><page sequence="27">American Literary History 595 off into leveling entropy, but where "abundance without selec- tion" is also the rule, in contrast to the restrictive, hierarchical orders of the city. Like Clampitt contemplating the polluted Hackensack, he "does not flinch" or hold his nose in selective civility, nor shake his head in grief and rage, but instead "calmly turns to praise" (Collected 320). Ammons tests his ability to praise in the recent long poem Garbage (1993), in which the aesthetics of superfluity finds a met- aphor that will not escape its material implication. Here Am- mons asks not so much "what to make of a diminished thing" as what to make of the enormity we have created, a highway dust that has piled up to mountainous proportions, entropy backed up with superfluity and garbage blocking out real mountains. The backside of civility is obscuring its face. Even so, the answer is not grief and rage. There is more late Stevens than early Eliot in this waste land. Ammons's Garbage concerns the repetitious- ness of men and flies; there is nothing barren about his scenes. Like Stevens, he sees in that repetitiousness of creativity and waste the life of the imagination, like the life of nature, continu- ing: "where but in the arrangements love crawls us / through, not a thing left in our self-display / unhumiliated, do we find the sweet seed of/ new routes" (8). This is not a call for restraint. If what the imagination produces inevitably becomes garbage, it is a condition of the imagination's fecundity rather than a sign of the imagination's corruption. The poet gets no special exemp- tion, either of permanence or innocence. The call for "new routes," however, may suggest a challenge to consumerism as an expression of desire. A pile of garbage suggests backup, not su- perfluity, the image of a restricted economy that is coming to a standstill. As we contemplate this mountain of garbage we must remember that Ammons does not generally like mountains. They obstruct his nomadic instincts. He develops a poetics of dispos- ability and transfiguration that keeps the mind moving through illusion and "self-display" while minimalizing the accumulation of its discarded productions. One might even call this a poetics of "recycling," allowing for an open system of exchange rather than a closed cycle, with an emphasis on productivity rather than reuse. Ammons continues Stevens's exploration of the dump as a privileged place for the modern poet. But Ammons refuses the sense in Stevens's "The Man on the Dump" (1938) of a momen- tary authenticity achievable when the poet "rejects the trash" (Collected 184). Stevens's irony (that the genuine can be known only on the dump) has become Ammons's plenitude (something the later Stevens, of "The Plain Sense of Things" [1952] was be-</page><page sequence="28">596 Modern Nature and Poetic Response ginning to discover) in which the trash is part of the truth, part of how we see things, not something we can clear away to expose a primal reality. What Stevens approached through a pastoral absorption of waste into presence (the pond and its waste of lil- ies), Ammons confronts as explicitly man-made waste backing up in the landscape. But this image leads Ammons to a great deal of playfulness and experimentation, rather than Tho- reauvian sermonizing. The poem spins out theories not in a di- dactic or epistemological mood so much as in a creative, adven- turous one. Garbage exemplifies its meaning in a digressive, parodic, and even frivolous style. The characteristic, Whitmanian abundance of Ammons's enumerations now turns to the vision of backup, consumer excess: "[O]ld deck chairs, crippled aluminum lawn chairs, lemon crates / and busted slats or hinges, strollers with / whacking or spinningly idle wheels: stub ends / of hot dogs" (75). Ammons clearly exalts in listing such paraphernalia for its rhetorical power and associative richness. Our superfluity is associated with consumption (food) and mobility (abandoned chairs). But has this poetic enthusiasm for random trash as a symbol of the obsolescence of all human constructions blinded the poet to the more sobering implications of the great pyre he beholds off 1-95 in Florida? On the one hand, Garbage is an admonitory poem. This is no time for the imagination to retreat into John Muir's wilderness or the fantasies of Albert Bierstadt. "Garbage has to be the poem of our time because / garbage is spiritual, believable enough / to get our attention, getting in the way, piling / up, stinking, turning brooks brownish and / creamy white: what else deflects us from the / errors of our illusionary ways" (8). There is a wonderful paradox here, in which garbage is at once abstract (spiritual) and material (piling up). Its materiality is a spur to a spiritual re- sponse, but not the response of restraint or restriction. This inter- play is deliberate and will become a central device in the poem, both allowing for a distinction between the imaginary and the real and refusing their easy separation or hierarchy. We cannot mystify away the stuff, but neither do we simply submit to it as a shrine of shame and a call to relinquishment. On the other hand, if garbage takes on iconic power as a monument to human waste, it also presents an alternative ecol- ogy in its own right, one in which the grand illusions and the local transformations are dialectically engaged. Stevens's Azcan (recalling both the feather-dressed Aztec ruler and the dressed- down "Ashcan school" of painting) and his inchling coexist on this mountain of trash. In reinventing "nature" Ammons retains a theory of primacy, but it applies to origins, not ends or present</page><page sequence="29">American Literary History 597 priorities: "nature, not we, gave rise to us." Yet the cultural be- comes more than an epiphenomenon of nature: "we are not, though, though natural, divorced from higher, finer configura- tions" (Garbage 217). Ultimately his view locates nature and cul- ture in a larger pattern of integration in which questions of pri- macy disappear. This is more dialectical (and even ironic) than holistic, however. One of the major tropes of the poem is the "spindle of energy" that ties the material and the spiritual to- gether in a rotating movement. Ammons enacts this movement in the language as it turns from comic to visionary, particular to abstract: [T]issues and holograms of energy circulate in us and seek and find representations of themselves outside us, so that we can participate in celebrations high and know reaches of feeling and sight and thought that penetrate (really penetrate) far, far beyond these our wet cells, right on up past our stories, the planets, moons, and other bodies locally to the other end of the pole where matter's forms diffuse and energy loses all means to express itself except as spirit, there, oh, yes, in the abiding where mind but nothing else abides, the eternal, until it turns into another pear or sunfish, the momentary glint in the fisheye having been there so long, coming and going, it's eternity's glint: it all wraps back round, into and out of form. (118) This cycling rhythm of embodiment and spiritual expenditure is different from the prescriptive ecological economy of restraint and balance. The equilibrium is a dynamic one, like that imag- ined by Emerson, in which equilibrium emerges from madness and excess. Garbage is the inevitable result of the movement in and out of form and representation. The "eternal world" has no independent metaphysical status and emerges, rather, as a phe-</page><page sequence="30">598 Modern Nature and Poetic Response nomenon of the mind's engagement with the flux of life. So, para- doxically, even "the eternal" becomes part of the superfluity, not a still point set against it. Reflecting this "spindle of energy," Ammons adopts two distinct kinds of rhetoric, expressing two distinct stances toward the fluency of the world. These alternate in the poem and also evoke or imply each other, each offering a channel for the poet's responsive superfluity. They also describe a rhythm of shifting scales, the superhuman and the subhuman, that help to gauge the human place. In one role Ammons adapts the Romantic sublime to the spectacle of garbage, a deliberate, conspicuous mystification. The parodic character of the gesture does not entirely undermine it, however. Ammons's tendency to address secular, natural phe- nomena in religious rhetoric, while it has often brushed the mock-heroic, pursues a serious point. There is something mysti- cal about garbage, looked at on a comprehensive scale. Like all sublimes, it evokes both horror and awe. The "consummations gather" here before the "gods of garbage, of retribution, of realis- tic expectation, of unpleasant necessities" (18). This is the oppo- site of the egotistical sublime, not only because it deals with an antiaesthetic but because it is an awe of humanity's limits rather than of its possibilities. But no sublime inspires relinquishment. The high priest of Garbage is the garbage spreader, his vestments the protective clothes he wears as he ascends the mountain of garbage to roll the waste material and expose it to the transfigur- ing fire. He is the literal man on the dump, the priest of the invis- ible or "invisible priest" of Stevens's poem, and his proportions are heroic. As the facilitator of the spindle of energy, the con- version of matter into spirit, he resembles the Romantic poet be- fore the spectacle of nature. He is capable of standing "in the presence / of the momentarily everlasting," itself the consumer's consummation of the "dense vegetation of desire"-the products of our superfluity. The passages play between the mystical and mundane, identifying necessity and imagination, addressing with apostrophes and vocatives the "eternal flame, principle of the universe, without which mere heaviness and gray rust pre- vail" (22). But Ammons checks all mystifications. This priest is also the beer belly in a bulldozer, turning the incendiary surface of a huge mess. The language of awe and the transfiguring flame is one channel of lyric energy. But it does not really do the job. The poem is dedicated "to the bacteria, tumblebugs, scavengers, / wordsmiths-the transfigurers, restorers" (n. pag.) not to the vi-</page><page sequence="31">American Literary History 599 sionaries, and a considerable portion of the poem is involved in imagining the lowly work of local transfiguration, not just the exalted work of spiritual transfiguration. Ammons has never been satisfied to dwell in the upper regions of the spindle of en- ergy for long. Here the poet finds beauty not in the universal flame and its symbolism but in the swarming buzzards and the decomposition of a worm in water. Plenty can be made of dimin- ished things. In this role the poet can indulge self-consciously in "low" poetic impulses-parody, puns, lists, alliterations: the "arch" in Archie and hierarchy, "the dame (dam, damn, dike)" the "puffy muffins (puffins)"; "don't sorry, be sappy" (18, 100). Language and nonsense meet and fade into each other as words are broken apart and reassembled. This is transfiguration of a more material kind, even if it is only the material of language. At times Ammons seems to reach a Whitmanian exhilaration in the trash, to celebrate its abundance, but there is the impulse of the scavenger in these productions of lists. Here the transfigurations have nothing to do with an economy of meaning or spiritual value: The heap of knicknacks (knickknackatery), whatnots (whatnotery), doodads, jews-harps, belt buckles, do-funnies, files, disks, pads, pesticide residues, nonprosodic high-tension lines, whimpering-wimp dolls, epichlorohydrin elastomotors, sulfur dioxide emissions, perfume sprays, radioactive williwaws. (108) This is a "scientific poem" with a "purpose" "asserting that nature models values" (108) but it is also a deliberately trashy poem, flagrantly superfluous, asserting that meaning is behavior. "Grooming does for baboons most of what words do for us" (52). Ammons cuts off the referential connection of language (and "meaning") to some truth grounded in nature or metaphysics. He seeks to release language from its part in an accumulative economy-"meaning" being one of those illusionary connec- tions to civilization. But at the same time he establishes a new, nonreferential connection between culture and nature, based on mutual participation in "the ongoing," in the superfluous fluency of the world. He identifies two "species" of word users: "loud- mouths" (of which the oven bird must be one) and "blabber</page><page sequence="32">600 Modern Nature and Poetic Response mouths" (like the embellishing Stevens or the digressive Am- mons). In a poem confronting garbage these behaviors are ex- posed for what they are, but the alternative of silence is raised only as an intermittent connection with the "ongoing," which recharges the poet's energy. "If the measure of man is not how much he says or how loud, I'm sure I cannot imagine what to say next" (80). Without his superfluities man fears his disappear- ance, his lack of measure. So language is affirmed though silence borders each end of the spindle, the sublime awe and the surren- der to local processes. Ammons delights in acts of representa- tion: "[S]o I derived the nature / of each thing from itself and made each derivation / speak ... I made tongues / for the adder's tongue, periwinkle, and jimminy cricket; / they wagged, and these tongues range in my head / as in a chanson delicate of essence and point" (81). The impulse to represent leads to a fantasy of autonomy, exuberantly aired: "[W]e'll live no more on / this planet, we'll live in the word .. . we'll kick the I out of the world and cuddle / up with the avenues and byways of the word" (76- 77). But this notion itself is trash. A counterimpulse, to disdain the word and revere the world in silence, turns quickly upon the airy moments. Ammons seeks "disposal" under "garbage" in the library catalog and finds noth- ing, a paradoxical opening to dump all words and find the world. Words are, after all, garbage: a waste of words, a flattened-down, smoothed- over mesa of Styrofoam verbiage; since words were introduced here things have gone poorly for the planet: it's been between words and rivers, surface-mining words and hilltops, cuneiform records in priestly piles; between clay tablets and irrigated fields: papyrus in sheets; vellum in Alexandria; hundreds of temples to type and, now, networks of words intricate as the realities they represent.... poetry to no purpose! all this garbage! all these words: we may replace our mountains with trash. (74-75)</page><page sequence="33">American Literary History 601 The poem rotates-on its own spindle of energy-between these moods, rejoicing in the production of words, but wary of accu- mulation and will to autonomy. Surrounded by simulacra, we long to experience something, to reconnect with the "mix of mo- tions" in the world, "communicative, but not with human sound, communicative motions making sounds, much mutual glistening in a breezy grove of spring aspen speech" (84). Language is an expression of our superfluity. "Language is something to write home about, but it is not the world" (52). Behind this mix of motions, though, is no grand design or eternal Mind that human speech, or even consciousness, can unveil. Under language is more language. poetry is itself like an installation at Marine Shale: it reaches down into the dead pit and cool oil of stale recognition and words and brings up hauls of stringy gook which it arrays with light and strings with shiny syllables and gets the mind back into vital relationship with communication channels. (108-09) Such a vision "accepts the trash" and maneuvers it so that the mind keeps moving through renewing change. Purity is no longer the goal. Garbage abandons both elegy and restraint as responses to human superfluity. That superfluity is itself seen as part of the fecund, open dynamic of the world. But cultural material is never entirely transfigurable. The poem is not naive about the cost of "renewing change" that inevitably leaves behind a residue of its cast-off commodities, undegradable plastic lids and poems, that can obscure the very world they promote. Ammons's poetics does not suggest a utopian efficiency: but, of course, there is some untransformed material, namely the poem itself; the minute its transmutations end, it becomes a relic sometimes only generations or sets of countrywide generations can degrade: a real stick in the fluencies: a leftover light that hinders the light stream: poems themselves</page><page sequence="34">602 Modern Nature and Poetic Response processing, revitalizing so much dead material become a dead-material concentrate time's longest actions sometimes can't dissolve. (109) Ammons does not evade or protest this fact. It is part of the "triste" of the "high moments." The residue of representation becomes an aspect of what the world is. Yet his own poetry, with its disposable statements and scavenged contraptions, works against the effect of residue and heightens the sense of transfigu- ration within the aesthetics of superfluity. As these poems encounter the environment it is not a pris- tine Otherness on which they can engender or discover meaning. It has no "primacy" for them experientially since the residue of past meaning, the dust and waste of previous imaginings and organizations, is thick upon it, to be dredged, dismantled, re- arranged, but not erased. But neither is environment for them a mere hyperreality or social construct. Abstraction is not only a condition of the mind and culture, but also part of a "spindle of energy" that draws us back to the material world. These poets retain the fluent, flexible referent of nature, distinct from culture but not separable from it. Within this highly qualified condition of engagement modern American poetry persists in celebrating the importance of the nonhuman environment in satisfying the needs and desires of the imagination. These poets are alive to the attractions of the natural world and troubled by the abuse of it. Garbage is not suddenly benign because a poet finds in it some visionary resonance. But the human place in nature is dynamic and productive, not static and receptive. And the nature these poets imagine is likewise prolific and dynamic, not a stable ecol- ogy of limited circulation. One will not find, in Ammons or Clampitt, praise for steep mountains and lofty cliffs or any sense of space as a lie against time. Nor will one find a celebration of enduring local ecologies. It is the fugitive, the fecund, the exces- sive, the mobile, that appeals to them. Thus, in their role as poets, at least, they are not ready to adopt an aesthetics of relin- quishment in return for an abiding natural scene. Their effort is, rather, to bring their own excesses into some confluence with the superfluities beyond them. Notes 1. Recent Darwinian theory echoes this view. In writers such as Richard Daw- kins (The Blind Watchmaker [1985] and River Out of Eden. A Darwinian View</page><page sequence="35">American Literary History 603 of Life [1995]) and Daniel Dennett (Darwin's Dangerous Idea: Evolution and the Meanings of Life [1995]), nature's economy is itself driven by an algorithm of excess and waste and by the impulse of life forms to occupy openings and grasp opportunities for expansion. 2. John Elder, in his "Nature's Refrain in American Poetry," argues that the proper task of the contemporary nature poet is raging and mourning. 3. Bill McKibben's call in The End of Nature (1989) for a radical separation of man and nature, and his yearning for a condition of primal nature, is logi- cally flawed and scientifically suspect. For a valuable critique of the book, see Edward Picot's Outcasts from Eden: Ideas of Landscape in British Poetry since 1945 (1997). 4. The concept of Nature, like all human concepts, is historical, and as the century comes to a close, new definitions of nature and our relation to it are emerging. The call for "reinventing nature" is answered, or counterpointed, by an assertion of nature's absolute reality claiming that Nature is not a "human concept" but a ground of truth and meaning. The argument has developed a polemical rhetoric designed to avoid a reckoning with complex experience. "There is no nature," writes New Historicist Alan Liu in Wordsworth. The Sense of History (1989) (104), inspiring Jonathan Bate to claim Wordsworth for the ecology movement. Karl Kroeber answers with an earth-first philosophy and a call to recenter ecological thinking away from the human point of view, as if some other point of view could be known or articulated by humans. W. J. T. Mitchell, in "Imperial Landscape," calls for the end of landscape as a genre. Of course most of us in modernity, and most of these writers when they are not engaging in polemics, live in a world between these conditions, a world conceptually and physically constructed by us, in which a nonhuman reality plays a felt but not definable part, and also defines limits to our constructions. 5. Of particular interest is Cronon's essay "Rethinking the Wilderness," in which he reveals the wilderness itself as a construction, an ideologically suspect one at that, rather than as a return to some unconstructed state of nature. 6. The birdsong of this pedagogical bird, it has been pointed out, is often translated as "teacher, teacher." 7. Georges Bataille's notion of restricted and general economy, which Poirier introduces by way of Leo Bersani (Poirier 53), offers a helpful analogy to the aesthetics of superfluity explored by these poets. Bataille contrasts restricted economies, built on structures of use value and exchange and limited in terms of their circulation, to a "general economy" that involves superfluous energies expended in an ultimately useless flow (Bataille 116-30). Language poets Ste- ven McCaffrey and Charles Bernstein have applied this notion to a postmodern poetic play of meaning and meaninglessness in texts (Bernstein [16-17] quotes McCaffrey's "Writing as General Economy" [1987]). Though the poets I discuss here do not practice such radical artifice, certain similarities are worth noting. Through the natural image they express an alternative to the "restricted econ- omy" of commodity economics and at the same time illustrate an overriding superfluity in the general economy that can be seen in both natural and human expenditures. Local ecologies are restricted economies just as local exchange systems are-but both man and nature also participate in a general economy</page><page sequence="36">604 Modern Nature and Poetic Response that is unrestricted and fluent. In the poetry, too, Clampitt, Ammons, and oth- ers maintain a clear connection to a system of meaning yet develop a poetry that is "excessive" in expenditure for production of meaning, with pulsive ener- gies and structures that resist, dissolve, or otherwise open up the meaning- directed text. In a certain sense this is, of course, inherent in the literary, which is always excessive in its relation to semantic value. Works Cited Alpers, Paul. What Is Pastoral? Chi- Dawkins, Richard.
