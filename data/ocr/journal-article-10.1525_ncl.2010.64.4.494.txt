<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> “No insignificant   creature”: Thomas   Hardy’s Ethical Turn El i sHa  CoHN   Late in his life Thomas Hardy became  increasingly committed to animal welfare. in april 1910 he  wrote to the secretary of the Humanitarian league: “the most  far-reaching consequence of the establishment of the common  origin of all species, is ethical. . . . Possibly Darwin himself did  not wholly perceive it, though he alluded to it.”1 Critics have  usually seen Hardy’s concern for animals as a consequence of  his pessimistic view that evolution makes struggle and suffer- ing universal, but his emphasis on altruism introduces a hope- ful note.2 Kindness to animals was not just one instance but  Nineteenth-Century Literature, Vol. 64, No. 4, pp. 494–520. issN: 0891-9356, online issN: 1067- 8352. © 2010 by The Regents of the University of California. all rights reserved.

What, then, led Hardy to reconceive  the relationship between humans and animals as ethical? in this essay i argue that for Hardy the relationship be- tween humans and animals depends on how human autonomy  and agency are understood. The changing status of agency  in Hardy’s work reflects nineteenth-century uncertainty about  whether animals’ consanguinity with humans, and, more broadly,  the biological instability of the human species, should shape  ethical thought. as many critics have argued, the challenges  that nineteenth-century science and philosophy posed to hu- man supremacy had the potential to alter radically literature’s  focus on individual subjectivity and social life. in particular,  the new relevance of animals seemed as likely to deflate norms  for human behavior as to posit new objects of human benevo- lence. But critics rarely think that Victorian literature used  animal figures to explore evolution’s radically anti-humanist  implications because well-known literary animals like the an- thropomorphic dogs of George Eliot’s Adam Bede (1859) or the  abused horses of anna sewell’s Black Beauty (1877) function  within an aesthetic organized around the emotional politics of  sympathy.4 i argue, however, that animals play two divergent  roles in Victorian literature: they can be figures in a radically  of the universe” (Millgate, Thomas Hardy: A Biography Revisited [New York: oxford Univ.  Press, 2004], p. 254). Millgate suggests that kindness comes of pessimism, and that  reevaluating whether humans are distinguished from other animals as ethical agents  is not central to Hardy’s grounds for ethics. see also Preece, “Darwinism, Christianity,  and the Great Vivisection Debate,” p. 402. 3 Thomas Hardy, 1909 letter, quoted in Florence Emily Hardy, The Later Years of  Thomas Hardy, p. 138. 4  see James Eli adams, “Gyp’s Tale: on sympathy, silence, and Realism in Adam  Bede,” Dickens Studies Annual, 20 (1991), 227–42; Tess Cosslett, Talking Animals in  British Children’s Fiction, 1786–1914 (aldershot: ashgate, 2006), pp. 63–92; and ivan  Kreilkamp, “Petted Things: Wuthering Heights and the animal,” Yale Journal of Criticism,  18 (2005), 87–110.

For many critics who consider humanism and agency in  Hardy’s novels, the more radical side dominates because Har- dy’s readings in the fields of both evolution and cosmology  led him to cast doubt on human autonomy. George levine,  Gillian Beer, and Nicholas Dames, among others, have argued  that for many late Victorians evolution meant that forms of  life were determined by—not just predicated upon—physical  processes; biological determination negated autonomous hu- man agency, and thus it threatened notions of responsibility.5  The work of Charles Darwin features prominently in these  accounts, insofar as The Origin of Species (1859) is understood  to redefine the broadly construed progress of species as non- teleological and not attributable to the individual agency of any  particular member of a species. When Darwin suggests that  evolution supports the human development of moral systems,  as in The Descent of Man (1871), he is concerned with how val- ues disseminate and how the values recognized as nineteenth- century English morality were not transcendent but rather  the adaptively beneficial results of the improvement of the  human species. accordingly, Darwin’s writings refrain from  prescriptive statements about evolution’s implications for the  kinds of relationships that humans should cultivate with ani- mals. in his notebook he writes: “if we choose to let conjecture  run wild, then animals our fellow brethren in pain, disease  death &amp; suffering &amp; famine; our slaves in the most laborious  work, our companions in our amusements. they may partake,  from our origin in one common ancestor we may be all netted  5 George levine emphasizes “the growing nineteenth-century dissatisfactions  with closure” (levine, Darwin and the Novelists: Patterns of Science in Victorian Fiction  [Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Univ. Press, 1988], p. 19). in regard to Hardy, levine adds:  “There is no reason, then, to assume that the new will in any way affirm the highest hu- man values, or be in any way relevant to them. Hardy’s exploitation of the conventions  of coincidence and happenstance to increase not diminish the protagonists’ suffering  is one entirely legitimate inference from the Darwinian scheme” (Darwin and the Novel- ists, p. 250). Nicholas Dames more explicitly makes the loss of morality the effect of  evolutionary thought (see Dames, “‘The withering of the individual’: Psychology in the  Victorian Novel,” in A Concise Companion to the Victorian Novel, ed. Francis o’Gorman  [oxford: Blackwell, 2005], p. 100).

Describing  the latter possibility in an 1892 letter, Hardy writes: You may call the whole human race a single ego if you like; &amp;  in that view a man’s consciousness may be said to pervade the  world; but nothing is gained. Each is, to all knowledge, limited  to his own frame. or with spinoza, &amp; the late W. K. Clifford, you  may call all matter mind-stuff (a very attractive idea this, to me)  but you cannot find the link (at least i can’t) of one form of con- sciousness with another.9 Here Hardy appears doubly unsatisfied—philosophically at- tracted to ontological monism, which undermines his notion of  6  see Darwin, Notebook B, in Charles Darwin’s Notebooks, 1836–1844: Geology, Trans- mutation of Species, Metaphysical Enquiries, transcribed and ed.

Preece argues that Darwin- ism had no clear moral implications for the late Victorians, noting that Darwin was  recruited to both sides of the anti-vivisection debates of the 1870s (see “Darwinism,  Christianity, and the Great Vivisection Debate”). 7 Thomas Hardy, letter to Caleb saleeby, 16 March 1915, in The Collected Letters of  Thomas Hardy, ed.

H. Huxley and leslie stephen as well  as Clifford, makes the ethical implications of evolution a mat- ter of drawing provisional boundaries that demarcate agents.  in 1893 Huxley claimed: “The conscience of man revolted  against the moral indifference of nature, and the microcosmic  atom should have found the illimitable macrocosm guilty.”11  Highlighting the disconnect between subjective experience— not only the experience of conscience but also of subjectiv- ity itself—and the rules of nature, Huxley regrets that they re- main irreconcilable conceptions of existence, and that their  very irreconcilability threatens the authority of human morals.  Huxley’s conclusions, though, were much like those of Hardy’s  mentor leslie stephen, who argued that moral responsibility is  a matter of the consistency of “character,” a theory that blends  the moral and literary meanings of the term, which it takes to  be a self-made narrative construct. if, as stephen argued in The  Science of Ethics (1882), an individual’s sense of agency is an ex- periential given that cannot be dismissed, then we should not  treat it as a groundless illusion: “a man’s character,” stephen  writes, “is what it is; it makes no difference that, like everything  in the universe, it has grown according to assignable laws in- stead of springing into being miraculously. . . . The criterion  of merit or responsibility is the dependence of conduct upon  10 Drawing on spinoza, William Kingdon Clifford writes: “That element of which,  as we have seen, even the simplest feeling is a complex, i shall call Mind-stuff. a moving  molecule of inorganic matter does not possess mind or consciousness; but it possesses  a small piece of mind-stuff. When molecules are so combined together as to form the  film on the under side of a jelly-fish, the elements of mind-stuff which go along with  them are so combined as to form the faint beginnings of sentience. . . . When matter  takes the complex form of a living human brain, the corresponding mind-stuff takes  the form of a human consciousness, having intelligence and volition” (Clifford, “on the  Nature of Things-in-Themselves” [1878], rpt. in Lectures and Essays, by the Late William  Kingdon Clifford, ed. leslie stephen and Frederick Pollock, 2d ed. [london: Macmillan  Co., 1886], p. 284). 11 Thomas H. Huxley, Evolution and Ethics (1894), rpt. in T. H. Huxley’s “Evolution  and Ethics,” with New Essays on Its Victorian and Sociobiological Context, ed. James Paradis  and George C. Williams (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1989), p. 117 [p. 59]. NCL6404_03.indd   498 3/20/10   10:24:06 AM </page> <page sequence="6"> thomas hardy’s ethical turn 499 character.”12 From this perspective, limiting the scope of ethical  discourse to “character” legitimates the conception of agency  under threat from the passivity of cosmological and evolution- ary processes. This is not to say that, for stephen, character and  cosmos are objectively incompatible, but that they cannot be  productively thought or experienced together. Hardy’s adoption of a similar concept of human agency  appears to enable his critique of cruelty and his promotion  of altruism. in this essay i demonstrate that the changing ap- proach to human agency is reflected in key changes in narra- tive strategies in Hardy’s novels, registering the formalism of  boundary-drawing in the scientific and philosophical thought  of his era. as i suggest, Tess of the D’Urbervilles (1891) transitions  toward validating human agency. in comparatively early work,  especially The Return of the Native (1878), the lyrical instability  of narrative perspective evokes a world without human auton- omy, agency, or individuality in which animals and humans ap- pear to interpenetrate. But Tess registers an increasing invest- ment in addressing pragmatic moral problems by shifting from  lyricism to the more stable perspective offered by free indirect  discourse and analogy. as Hardy suggests in Tess, art can af- firm a radical ontology, but representing strongly demarcated  boundaries motivates a more ethically oriented practice, as in  both Tess and Jude the Obscure (1895). in order to suggest that  human intervention can and should prevent the suffering of  animals, Hardy comes to favor a more traditional aesthetics of  sympathy over the narrative style associated earlier in his ca- reer with effacing human agency and individuality. He limits  his narrative scope to individual human characters encounter- ing individuated animals, a strategy that enables evaluation and  responsibility at the expense of ontological continuity. Finding grounds for his sympathetically oriented expecta- tions of stable human agency after having seemingly dispensed  with them, Hardy speaks to current debates over the claims of  Continental theorists whose work is central to the growing field  of animal studies. Hardy’s radically anti-humanist lyricism can  be usefully illuminated by Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari’s  12  stephen, The Science of Ethics (london: smith, Elder, and Co., 1882), p. 285. NCL6404_03.indd   499 3/20/10   10:24:06 AM </page> <page sequence="7"> 500  nineteenth-century literature A Thousand Plateaus, in which the concept of becoming-animal  refers to the instability of the distinction between the human  and the nonhuman—“traversing human beings and sweep- ing them away.”13 This concept is part of a holistic rejection  of the philosophical and psychoanalytic notion of the unitary  individual in favor of a process of individuation: “each indi- vidual,” Deleuze and Guattari write, “is an infinite multiplicity,  and the whole of Nature is a multiplicity of perfectly individu- ated multiplicities” (A Thousand Plateaus, p. 254). Each animal  is immanently dynamic, a living process within an ontologically  continuous or univocal nature.14 Reflecting the dissolution of  human privilege that began in the nineteenth century, theories  of becoming, including Deleuze and Guattari’s and, recently,  Brian Massumi’s, constitute a contemporary version of the  deeply anti-humanist commitments that Hardy explored. although the theory of becoming-animal has been influ- ential in animal studies, it remains in tension with approaches  that stress otherness rather than continuity.15 Jacques Derrida’s  emphasis on the epistemological gap, or “abyssal rupture” be- tween human and animal minds, entails a rejection of ontologi- cal continuity.16 Derrida speaks of encountering animals across  this gap; in the encounter, the otherness of animals challenges  without dispersing the human privilege necessary to motivate  compassion. Recognition of otherness (and its unknown con- tent) is, for Derrida, as crucial for an ethic of care as it has  been instrumental for the exploitation of animals. as David  Wood explains: “it is where obvious continuities break down  that the ethical begins”—“thinking (and responsible action)  typically consists not in resolving ambivalences, but in ‘going  13 Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophre- nia, trans.

Hardy’s work helps us  to rethink the theory, to understand why ethical claims require  boundaries between species, and on what basis these bound- aries can be legitimated—points to which i will return in my  conclusion. Human agency is profoundly unstable in  Hardy’s early work, which depicts animals and the environ- ment as vividly in flux without conceiving of them as vulnerable  to cruelty. Hardy’s narrators constantly shift perspectives, ren- dering individual humans, animals, and inanimate things indis- tinct. in particular, The Return of the Native, perhaps echoing the  “entangled bank” of Darwin’s Origin of Species, depicts insects  and birds—animals that exist in multiplicity, that swarm and  congregate—rather than the particularized, comparatively do- mestic pigs and horses of the later novels, whose individuality  is tied to their role as the objects of ethical care.18 in her influ- ential study of Hardy’s response to evolutionism, Gillian Beer  notes that “the moment-by-moment fullness” of Hardy’s narra- tion works against plots that seem to decry characters’ lack of  control over their lives.19 These moments, she argues, reflect  “the problem of finding a scale for the human . . ., a scale that  17 Wood, “Thinking with Cats,” in Animal Philosophy: Essential Readings in Continental  Thought, ed.

Michael l. Campbell and Ronald D.

Two passages in The Return of the Native very clearly dem- onstrate the workings of these moments—their profound am- bivalence toward human autonomy and their aesthetic impact.  animals flock to Clym Yeobright: The strange amber-coloured butterflies which Egdon produced,  and which were never seen elsewhere, quivered in the breath of  his lips, alighted upon his bowed back, and sported with the glit- tering point of his hook as he flourished it up and down. . . .  litters of young rabbits came out from their forms to sun them- selves upon hillocks, the hot beams blazing through the delicate  tissue of each thin-fleshed ear, and firing it to a blood-red trans- parency in which the veins could be seen.20 Clym’s absorption in his work offers the narrator an opportu- nity to engage in transformative description from no particu- lar point of view—Clym does not himself see the radiance of  rabbit ears. The passage shifts the scope of its gaze from land- scape swaths to microscopic focus, attending not just to the liv- ing things surrounding Clym but also to animating beams of  light. The light, color, heat, and frolic here indicate that “flour- ishing” means not only the cultivating action of Clym’s scythe  but also the gorgeous profusion of an environment that both  overwhelms what could be counted as his own experience and  sustains a disoriented sensuousness. Not dissimilarly, Clym’s  mother starts to forget herself—and the narrator starts to forget  20 Thomas Hardy, The Return of the Native, ed. Tony slade (london: Penguin, 1999),  p. 247.

The sun had now got far to the  west of south and stood directly in her face, like some merciless  incendiary, brand in hand, waiting to consume her. . . . all vis- ible animation disappeared from the landscape, though the in- termittent husky notes of the male grasshoppers from every tuft  of furze were enough to show that amid the prostration of the  larger animal species an unseen insect world was busy in all the  fulness of life. (Return of the Native, pp. 281–82) The narrative voice here hovers between the different scales of  life, and as for the ominously termed “larger animal species,”  her increasing passivity reveals that the coexistence of the hu- man and the buzzing multitudes strikes through a distinction  between the human domain and the natural environment, dis- pensing with human consciousness and evoking the swarm.21  it is important, too, to note that these moments are implicitly  antisocial in that they remove characters from their social con- texts and capitalize on their inattentiveness (to themselves, to  anything human, to any individual thing), placing them in a  relation with the natural environment, which does not offer or  demand reciprocal recognition. such moments occur in many of the best-known scenes  in Tess of the D’Urbervilles as well. D. E. Musselwhite, drawing  on Deleuze and Guattari, has argued that Tess functions as a  becoming-woman or becoming-animal. From this perspective,  Tess herself occupies an unrepresentable “border experience,” a  process of passage between the heterogeneity and multiplicity  of affective intensities and the constitution of fixed identities.22  21 Michael irwin notes that Hardy’s biomorphic images “seem to involve not mere  similitude, but assimilation” (irwin, Reading Hardy’s Landscapes [New York: st. Martin’s  Press, 2000], p. 33). 22  see D. E. Musselwhite, “Tess of the d’Urbervilles: ‘a becoming woman’ or  Deleuze  and Guattari go to Wessex,” Textual Practice, 14 (2000), 511. For Deleuze and Guat- tari “becoming-animal” and “becoming-woman” are similar processes, both signifying  flight from a majoritarian conception of identity: “it must be said that all becomings  NCL6404_03.indd   503 3/20/10   10:24:07 AM </page> <page sequence="11"> 504  nineteenth-century literature in this view, Hardy’s novel engages multiplicity and radical self- difference not bounded by species. For critics unwilling to ac- cept a scale that does not fit a realist conception of character,  however, these scenes efface Tess’s character with pernicious  indifference. For example: Every leaf of the vegetable having already been consumed, the  whole field was in colour a desolate drab; it was a complexion  without features, as if a face, from chin to brow, should be only  an expanse of skin. The sky wore, in another colour, the same  likeness; a white vacuity of countenance with the lineaments  gone. so these two upper and nether visages confronted each  other all day long, the white face looking down on the brown  face, and the brown face looking up at the white face, without  anything standing between them but the two girls crawling over  the surface of the former like flies.23 This passage actively and morbidly flouts the attempt to “find a  place for the human,” particularly because it reenvisions a face  as separated from anything recognizably or desirably human or  animal, obscuring the laborers by reducing them to insects crawl- ing over what vaguely resembles a corpse. From a perspective un- willing to accept a scale that does not fit a realist conception of  character, this passage indicates an unacceptable anti-humanist  effacement of Tess when it compares her to a fly. From a per- spective more open to the inhuman, though, Hardy’s art depicts  forms of being immanent within Tess instead of suggesting that  her humanity has been eliminated.24 Thus, as i have suggested, Hardy’s aesthetic of becoming  involves shifts in perspective, blurred boundaries between the  begin with and pass through becoming-woman. it is the key to all the other becom- ings,” because “sexuality [or perhaps sexedness] is the production of a thousand sexes,  which are so many uncontrollable becomings” (A Thousand Plateaus, pp. 277, 278). 23 Thomas Hardy, Tess of the D’Urbervilles, ed.

Further references are to this edition and appear in the text. 24 linda M. shires, for instance, argues that in Tess Hardy radicalizes narrative by  creating a figure it cannot contain: “[Tess] exists outside as well as inside subjective im- pressions of her and hence she must necessarily elude whatever containers male view- ers and tellers devise for her” (shires, “The Radical aesthetic of Tess of the d’Urbervilles,”  in The Cambridge Companion to Thomas Hardy, ed.

The infamous garden  scene in Tess provides a prime example: The outskirt of the garden in which Tess found her- self had been left uncultivated for some years, and was now  damp and rank with juicy grass which sent up mists of pollen  at a touch; and with tall blooming weeds emitting offensive  smells—weeds whose red and yellow and purple hues formed  a polychrome as dazzling as that of cultivated flowers. she  went stealthily as a cat through this profusion of growth,  gathering cuckoo-spittle on her skirts, cracking snails that  were underfoot, staining her hands with thistle-milk and slug- slime, and rubbing off upon her naked arms sticky blights  which, though snow-white on the apple-tree trunks, made  blood-red stains on her skin. (Tess, p. 122) Drawing on terms provided by theories of becoming, we might  say that the intensities of texture and temperature here do not  depend on the representation of any particular individual’s ex- perience, but instead blur the distinction between character,  narrator, and implied reader without compromising intensity.  The passage reveals “the absence of a clear line of demarcation  between the physical, the vital, the human, and the superhu- man; the undecidability of immanence and transcendence.”26  This lack of a consistent narrative perspective evokes the dy- namic vitality of living matter while suggesting the ease with  which human concerns can be dismissed in favor of super- or  supra-human natural processes. Tracing the dissolution of boundaries in Tess alleviates  some of the pressure that social constructivist accounts place  25 This comment occurs in the context of a paragraph commending Hardy. 26 Brian Massumi, Parables for the Virtual: Movement, Affect, Sensation (Durham, N.C.:  Duke Univ.

For instance, according to John Goode, the  scene is “not [about] ‘nature’ at all, but the way in which Tess’s  subjectivity is constructed by the patriarchal hegemony that calls  it into being.”27 But as Guy Davidson argues, such an account of  Tess’s subjectivity (or deplorable lack thereof) obscures Hardy’s  concern with nature as the source of culture.28 Before Tess en- ters the garden, the narrator makes an abruptly depersonalized  inquiry into the relations between absence, presence, and ab- sorption: “There was no distinction between the near and the  far, and an auditor felt close to everything within the horizon.  The soundlessness impressed her [Tess] as a positive entity  rather than as the mere negation of noise” (Tess, p. 122). it is  difficult to resist fully the argument that Tess’s titanic, Eve-like  progress through the garden saturates the landscape with patri- archal discourses about the female body—but the narrator also  investigates alternative possibilities for identifying figures in the  landscape with a shift in scale that renders cuckoo-spittle and  slug-slime “positive entities” in what had been undifferentiated  and inanimate. Moreover, the scene implies that the constant  transformations of a dynamic, naturing nature is bound to an  ecstatic or post-subjective experience of art. as Tess progresses  through the garden, “conscious of neither time nor space,” the  narrator defuses her appreciation of angel’s music into a richly  diffuse lyricism: The exaltation which she had described as being producible at  will by gazing at a star, came now without any determination  of hers; she undulated upon the thin notes as upon billows,  and their harmonies passed like breezes through her, bringing  tears into her eyes. The floating pollen seemed to be his notes  made visible, and the dampness of the garden the weeping  of the garden’s sensibility. Though near nightfall, the rank- smelling weed-flowers glowed as if they would not close for in- tentness, and the waves of colour mixed with the waves of sound.

Yet while attending to the loss of boundaries  here, the narrator also gestures toward ethical concerns, noting  in the garden scene that “as she listened Tess, like a fascinated  bird, could not leave the spot” (p. 122). This analogy aligns  Tess with the novel’s images of damaged animality, connecting  passivity and immanence with vulnerability to suffering. Tess of the D’Urbervilles, like The Return of  the Native, interrogates the concept of human agency by em- phasizing losses of control—the dreamy daze of erotic attrac- tion, the exhausted daze of labor—but ultimately endorses a  concept of agency. Tess herself gives a proto-evolutionary voice  to this interrogation. she contrasts her fear of thousands of  past and future lives that at once form her life and negate her  autonomy—“i shall only act [their] part”—with her frustrated  desire for justice, asking “why the sun shines on the just and on  the unjust alike” (Tess, p. 126).29 But working through the ur- gency with which Tess invokes justice, the novel explicitly intro- duces cruelty rather than mere unavoidable suffering. Befitting  this shift in focus, changes in nature are conceived in social  terms, for “nature,” in this novel, ceases to seem indifferent to  humans, as it did in Mrs. Yeobright’s death scene in The Return  of the Native. instead, Hardy depicts nature as home to “the ir- resistible, universal, automatic tendency to find sweet pleasure  somewhere, which pervades all life” (Tess, p. 103), but also as  scarred by human activity. in attributing cruelty to culture in- stead of to nature, the novel works to critique suffering, imply- ing that humans must have some agency with which to reflect  upon and change that which is the result of human fault. 29 Tess’s version of determinism here is historical as well as biological. she says:  “Because what’s the use of learning that i am one of a long row only—finding out that  there is set down in some old book somebody just like me, and to know that i shall only  act her part; making me sad, that’s all. The best is not to remember that your nature  and your past doings have been just like thousands’ and thousands’, and that your com- ing life and doings ’ll be like thousands’ and thousands’” (Tess, p. 126).

Constructivist interpretations claim that the narrator  associates Tess with nature as a way of making her available to  his own and the readers’ desiring gaze; the narrative’s coercive  epistemic model condemns Tess to the tragedy that the nar- rator purports to lament.30 in this context, the narrator’s fre- quent comparisons of Tess and animals are especially trou- bling. For instance, of the passage in which Tess responds to  alec’s demand for a kiss by crying, “‘Will nothing else do?’ . . .  in desperation, her large eyes staring at him like those of a wild  animal” (Tess, p. 55), James Kincaid notes: “The narrator seems  to be caught up in alec’s procedures, offering to him and to  us the perfect simile; for what does one do to a wild animal?  Tame it, of course, which is what alec goes on to do.”31 Yet the  passage implies that it is those people who are cruel to each  other who see animals as inherently to be dominated. Within a  framework in which the narrator judges human behavior, ani- mals become available as similes, as means of characterization.  This availability does not necessarily undercut the implication  that it is cruel to dominate either women or wild animals, al- though it is not a coincidence that this evaluative use of ani- mals seems ethically problematic. The figurative use of animals  signals entry into the ethical domain, but not in the way that  these critics imagine. likening Tess to a suffering wild animal  does not simply diminish her power—instead, this method of  characterization, which renders previously amorphous nature  figural, implements stable boundaries for Tess’s consciousness  and agency. 30  see Kaja silverman, “History, Figuration and Female subjectivity in Tess of the  d’Urbervilles,” Novel: A Forum on Fiction, 18 (1984), 5–28; and Mary Jacobus, “Tess’s Pu- rity,” Essays in Criticism, 26 (1976), 318–38. in contrast, for Byron Caminero-santangelo,  because “the narrator seems more aware of the sinister potential in his natural analo- gies to lessen the value of Tess’s unique individuality,” the novel “seems to assert the  importance of morality but it undercuts the validity of nature as a grounding for that  morality” (Caminero-santangelo, “a Moral Dilemma: Ethics in Tess of the D’Urbervilles,”  English Studies, 75 [1994], 49, 60). 31 Kincaid, “‘You did not come’: absence, Death and Eroticism in Tess,” in Sex and  Death in Victorian Literature, ed.

While the novel offers a new re- pudiation of cruelty, valorizing Tess for sharing the narrator’s  sympathy for abused animals, this is not the animals’ only role.  The novel uses two separate vocabularies: the discourse of the  creature, based on a correlation or comparison of humans and  animals that still stresses their distinctness, and that the novel  marks as associated with ethical agency; and the discourse of  becoming-animal that has appeared in Hardy’s previous novels.  The ethically disabling discourse of becoming blurs self and  other, human and animal, character and environment, while  the discourse of the creature links Tess to images of damaged  animality but also depicts her alleviating animal suffering. and  ultimately, this novel implies, the transformation of boundaries  made possible by an aesthetics of becoming does not obliterate  ethical considerations in those cases in which the narrator’s use  of the language of becoming starts to contribute to the charac- ter’s vulnerability. The word “creature,” i argue, makes possible these ana- logical connections between Tess and animal vulnerability  because the term persistently marks a humanist domain con- cerned with the tragedy of failed agency: as Julia Reinhard  lupton has written in another context, “creature marks the rad- ical separation of creation and Creator. . . . or . . . between any- one or anything that is produced or controlled by an agent,  author, master, or tyrant.”32 The word “creature” for Hardy  refers to an ontological condition subject to transformation  by an outside agency, and specifically to Tess’s all-too-human  grief and outrage at her own abjectness. Early in the novel, the  narrator supplies a universalizing definition of the creature as  bound to an unhappy fate: Nature does not often say ‘see!’ to her poor creature at a time  when seeing can lead to happy doing; or reply ‘Here!’ to a body’s  cry of ‘Where?’ till the hide-and-seek has become an irksome out- worn game. We may wonder whether at the acme and summit of  32 lupton, “Creature Caliban,” Shakespeare Quarterly, 51 (2000), 1.

(Tess, p. 43) This passage integrates a partially materialized conception of  “social machinery”—real enough to jolt, like the carts and car- riages that literally bear Tess throughout the novel—with “na- ture,” linking the social and the natural through their mutual  capacity to cause suffering while suggesting, in mocking the no- tion of the “summit of the human progress,” that social imper- fections have an evolutionary basis.33 Thus, the term stresses  the universality of pain, key even to Hardy’s earliest work. What is new here is that the term “creature” also sheds a  recuperative, sympathetic light on specifically animal abject- ness. The novel’s first use of the term refers to the Durbey- field children, “helpless creatures” who are quickly linked to  the horse Prince, “the poor creature” (Tess, pp. 24, 30). in its  representation of nature, Tess foregrounds animal suffering at  human hands rather than the unavoidable voracity of preda- tion, whereas Hardy’s earlier novel The Woodlanders (1887), for  example, calmly acknowledges “stoats that had been sucking  the blood of the rabbits.”34 Tess locates the possibility of ethical  agency in analogies between the sociality of animals and that of  humans, which simultaneously emphasize their similarity and  their difference, ultimately positing interspecies relationships  as inherently ethical. The first animal of the novel, Prince,  blurs the line between the human family and a broader form  of consanguinity reconceived as suffering under exploitative  labor. insight into the horse’s own attitude to work prefigures  the novel’s interrogation of labor practices: . . . the girl led out the horse Prince, only a degree less rickety  than the vehicle. 33  For a supporting view, see Darwin, The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex  (amherst: Prometheus Books, 1997), pp. 100–131. 34 Thomas Hardy, The Woodlanders, ed.

(Tess, p. 30) at this point Tess has yet to become fully individualized—she  is still “the girl,” which she ceases to be when she “regard[s]  herself in the light of a murderess” (p. 35), an evaluation sup- ported by the narrative’s anthropomorphic entry into Prince’s  thoughts and feelings.35 The episode of Prince’s death, however, also makes use of  the aesthetic of becoming-animal, demonstrating the tension— ultimately unsustained—between the two stylistic approaches  that inform Hardy’s early rejection and later adoption of an  ethical aesthetic. Before Prince’s body is brought home, while  Tess and her brother abraham wait by the road with the corpse,  the narrator pulls back from the implications of the act: The atmosphere turned pale, the birds shook themselves in the  hedges, arose, and twittered; the lane showed all its white fea- tures, and Tess showed hers, still whiter. The huge pool of blood  in front of her was already assuming the iridescence of coagula- tion; and when the sun rose a million prismatic hues were re- flected from it. Prince lay alongside still and stark; his eyes half  open, the hole in his chest looking scarcely large enough to have  let out all that had animated him. (Tess, p. 33) Tess’s body reflects the landscape, which blanches in the scene’s  contraction to the image of gleaming clumps of blood, the source  of unexpected beauty. The narrator at once offers the tempting  suggestion that “all that had animated” Prince has been trans- formed into the “million prismatic hues”—a horse becoming- prismatic—and intimates that Prince no longer matters because  something more beautiful and less identifiable as a positive en- tity has come into being. The narrator’s descriptive energy fur- ther counteracts the evaluative implications of Prince’s death  35 Compare George Eliot’s Adam Bede, where entry into the minds of dogs supports  the novel’s claims that its third-person omniscient representation constitutes an ethical  form of knowledge. see Eliot, Adam Bede, ed. stephen Gill (london: Penguin, 1980),  pp. 9, 58.

Perhaps  the hoofs in the air have a darkly comic undertone, rendering  irrelevant Tess’s sense of tragedy, but stranger still is the pas- sage’s suggestion that Prince retains agency in “retracing” the  road. The “he” in “he retraced” cannot be identical to the self- aware, overworked “creature,” but instead appears to refer to  the assemblage of horse-body, cart, driver, air, light, and dust.  These two narrative elements of the episode—the style that pro- duces Prince as the object of responsibility versus the style that  renders him a locus of becoming—distinguish Hardy’s ethical  from his lyrical projects. as the episode of Prince’s death sug- gests, Tess offers these two modes as incommensurable—the  one evaluating actions, the other suggesting that evaluation has  no bearing on the new ontological possibilities that every glint  of light generates. But the tension between the two narrative modes exempli- fied in the representation of Prince’s death cedes to a more  consistent approach to animals in which interactions serve pri- marily to characterize humans. Whereas in The Return of the Na- tive contact between animals and humans was incidental, in Tess  of the D’Urbervilles the victimization of wild animals reveals that  nature has been thoroughly subjugated by human needs and  desires. in the service of characterization, animals confirm a  concrete, stable version of human identity. accompanying this  use of animals, for Hardy, is the degree of human agency nec- essary to ground sympathy and responsibility. When wild ani- mals are represented as victims, the novel indicates that their  lives are directly tied to, and exclusively represented by, their  interaction with the human world. When the narrator chides  Tess for her adherence to the pathetic fallacy, the novel plays  up the implications of focusing on the human values that per- vade the landscape but also underscores the deep relationality  of humanity to what is conceived of as outside it: . . . this encompassment of her own characterization, based on  shreds of convention, peopled by phantoms and voices antipa- thetic to her, was a sorry and mistaken creation of Tess’s fancy—a  NCL6404_03.indd   512 3/20/10   10:24:07 AM </page> <page sequence="20"> thomas hardy’s ethical turn 513 cloud of moral hobgoblins by which she was terrified without rea- son. it was they that were out of harmony with the actual world,  not she. Walking among the sleeping birds in the hedges, watch- ing the skipping rabbits on a moonlit warren, or standing under  a pheasant-laden bough, she looked upon herself as a figure of  Guilt intruding into the haunts of innocence. But all the while  she was making a distinction where there was no difference. Feel- ing herself in antagonism she was quite in accord. she had been  made to break a necessary social law, but no law known to the en- vironment in which she fancied herself such an anomaly. (Tess,  pp. 85–86) Hardy aligns the analogical reasoning of the pathetic fallacy with  the mistake of demanding—as Huxley and stephen claimed  one could not—that nature supply the grounds of ethics or il- lustrate a moral code, instead suggesting that the skipping rab- bits and nestling pheasants are continuous with Tess’s existence.  The pathetic fallacy fails not because Tess is wrong to attribute  her feelings to the world around her as a gesture of ontological  unity, but because she at once differentiates herself morally and  sees herself as continuous with nature. if ethical categorization  depends upon distinctions among animals, then because Tess  does not make these distinctions, her position is incoherent. But while the passage above depicts a frolicsome, burgeon- ing nature, the novel more often depicts animality as synony- mous with the capacity for suffering due to human cruelty, and  if suffering is of primary concern, then the spheres of nature  and culture are at once separated and collapsed, with a newly  abjected nature functioning as culture’s construct. Hardy por- trays animals victimized by mechanical agriculture to prefigure  Tess’s torture on the demonic threshing machine, at which  point the killing of the field animals is repeated. Though the  machine sounds, appealingly, “like the love-making of the  grasshopper,” the condemning tone of the first description is  unmistakable, converting the machine as a becoming-animal  to the machine as the object of critique because it is an instru- ment of human cruelty: Rabbits, hares, snakes, rats, mice, retreated inwards as into a fast- ness, unaware of the ephemeral nature of their refuge, and of  the doom that awaited them later in the day when, their covert  NCL6404_03.indd   513 3/20/10   10:24:07 AM </page> <page sequence="21"> 514  nineteenth-century literature shrinking to a more and more horrible narrowness, they were  huddled together, friends and foes, till the last few yards of up- right wheat fell also under the teeth of the unerring reaper, and  they were every one put to death by the sticks and stones of the  harvesters. (Tess, p. 87) While ephemerality in The Return of the Native referred to the  variations of scale in diverse forms of life, in this passage it re- fers to the brief, painful lives inflicted upon animals. The tech- nologization of the landscape seems to negate the possibility  of (grasshoppery) pleasure or even indifference. Equating ani- mality with the potential for suffering, the novel emphasizes  hunted powerlessness—hence Tess’s mournful thought that  “only a solitary cracked-voiced reed-sparrow greeted her from  the bushes by the river, in a sad, machine-made tone, resem- bling that of a past friend whose friendship she had outworn”  (Tess, p. 136). The metaphor seems to indicate that mechaniza- tion and sympathetic response are not mutually exclusive, but  closely or even causally tied.36 Tess’s sadness, then, adds a sense  of loss to the redefinition of the natural world as victim, indi- cating that a certain breadth of transformative vision is in the  process of being undermined. When Tess encounters pheasants shot by hunters, the nar- rator positions her outside humanity psychologically and spa- tially. as in the novel’s depiction of field animals, the narrator  here emphasizes torture for which there is no excuse: “Under  the trees several pheasants lay about, their rich plumage dab- bled with blood; some were dead, some feebly moving their  wings, some staring up at the sky, some pulsating feebly, some  contorted, some stretched out—all of them writhing in agony,  except the fortunate ones whose tortures had ended during  the night by the inability of nature to bear more” (Tess, p. 278).  Hardy’s diction affirms Tess’s disgust for the cruelty of hunters,  36 Tamara Ketabgian sees a related implication in Charles Dickens’s use of animals  to represent machines: “Hard Times . . . urges us to treat visions of mechanical regular- ity as expressions of deeply emotional forces, both on the part of machines and on the  part of people who, one way or another, resemble them” (Ketabgian, “‘Melancholy  Mad Elephants’: affect and the animal Machine in Hard Times,” Victorian Studies, 45  [2003], 672–73).

Mercifully and “tenderly” killing the birds,  Tess “was ashamed of herself for her gloom of the night, based  on nothing more tangible than a sense of condemnation under  an arbitrary law of society which had no foundation in Nature”  (p. 279). Characterizing Tess as having an articulate sense of  duty shared with her narrator differentiates between animal vic- timhood and human agency to produce an extremely clear-cut  obligation. From this point forward, Tess consistently grounds  her social critique in the ethics of relations with animals. For  instance, when she realizes the enormity of her crime in killing  alec, Tess tells angel: “How wickedly mad i was! Yet formerly  i never could bear to hurt a fly or a worm, and the sight of a  bird in a cage used often to make me cry” (p. 390). Here as  elsewhere, Hardy links the human capacity for reflective action  to responsibility for animal life, while the weakness of Tess’s  comment as an explanation for murder speaks, perhaps, to the  restriction of her character that occurs when she becomes not  an immanence but an agent. This construction of boundaries,  in which the self confronts an other, signals an entry into eth- ics. Ultimately, while descriptions of Tess and her environment  exceed creaturely logic and emphasize human-nonhuman on- tological continuity, the novel separates these possibilities from  the more constrained epistemology of encounter—the encoun- ter of self and other that governs ethical behavior. as audrey  Jaffe has shown, in typical Victorian considerations of sympathy  the ethical encounter reinforces boundaries between different  kinds of subjects; for Hardy such boundaries between the hu- man and the nonhuman enable the perception of wrong, the  defense of the powerless, and the critique of the empowered.37 Thus—and this is the final movement in Hardy’s turn away  from an aesthetic of becoming—since Tess’s increasing abject- ness is affiliated with these flights of transformative writing,  37  see Jaffe, Scenes of Sympathy: Identity and Representation in Victorian Fiction (ithaca:  Cornell Univ. Press, 2000), pp. 7, 13.

The narrator prevents a discourse of  becoming from taking over by insisting on the register of char- acter as both ethical and tragic. Tess becomes a figure which is part of the landscape; a field-woman pure and  simple, in winter guise. . . . Every thread of that old attire has  become wire-drawn and thin under the stroke of rain-drops, the  burn of sunbeams, and the stress of winds. There is no sign of  young passion in her now. . . . inside this exterior, over which the  eye might have roved as over a thing scarcely percipient, almost  inorganic, there was the record of a pulsing life which had learnt  too well, for its years, of the dust and ashes of things, of the cru- elty of lust and the fragility of love. (Tess, pp. 280–81) The narrator transfers a becoming-organic or becoming-pulse  from Tess herself, shot through with rain and light, to the eye of  the beholder. Though character has been evacuated, the narrator  insists on the ethically charged terms “cruelty” and “fragility,”  which suggest an incomplete transformation not perceived by  Tess herself. The narrator toys with the discourse of becoming  but registers its inability to confront the insistent language of  ethics, which brings with it the terms of character—conscious- ness, individuality, humanity. Though such scenes gesture to- ward transformative possibilities beyond the constraints of plot,  the impulse toward becoming is not an uncentered universal  impulse, but the narrator’s. and if the fantasy of becoming is  itself an imposition on fragility rather than an alternative, we  are back in the discourse of the creature. By insisting on a landscape pervaded by hu- man interference, Tess of the D’Urbervilles suggests no alternative  to a natural world of suffering creatures. Nature and culture, for  Hardy, have become inseparable due to the violent humanization  of the land, especially through industrial agriculture. Wild animals  no longer embody an alternative to entrapment in social conven- tion; instead, their suffering is a symptom of its pervasive domi- nance. Hardy cannot portray living beings as fluidly in process and  NCL6404_03.indd   516 3/20/10   10:24:07 AM </page> <page sequence="24"> thomas hardy’s ethical turn 517 as separate when separateness seems necessary to initiate social  critique. The discourse of becoming, then, cannot overtake that of  the creature, because only the stabilization of categories of species  and emphasis on unique human agency can ground the ethical im- perative of care that Hardy comes to advocate. Here Hardy seems  closer to Derrida’s abyssal logic than to the Deleuzian logic of be- coming-animal: as Derrida writes, to feel pity for animals in their  unfathomed otherness is both “a necessity” and “a constraint.”38  accordingly, Hardy’s implicit repudiation of his lyrical aesthetic  resonates with recent critiques of the theory of becoming. as Peter  Hallward argues, in the philosophy of becoming, dynamics are themselves anti-dialectical if not anti-relational,  [so] there can be little room . . . for relations of conflict or soli- darity, i.e., relations that are genuinely between rather than exter- nal to individuals, classes, or principles. . . . such a philosophy precludes a distinctively relational  conception of politics.39 For Hardy stable ontological differences are crucial to articulat- ing ethical relationality, but—and this is where he illuminates  difficulties in the Deleuzian approach—human control over dif- ferences deprives others of their dynamism.40 in Tess of the D’Urbervilles, humans control nature physically  but also conceptually: an ethical perspective renders the nonhu- man exclusively a product of human culture. When Tess pities  the suffering of hunted pheasants, for example, animal experi- ence appears entirely dependent on human agency. For Hardy  alterity—the human-animal division that enables ethics—cannot  38  see Derrida, “The animal that Therefore i am,” p. 397. 39 Hallward, Out of this World: Deleuze and the Philosophy of Creation (london and New  York: Verso, 2006), p. 162. 40  For a contrasting view, see alain Badiou, Deleuze: The Clamor of Being, trans. lou- ise Burchill (Minneapolis: Univ. of Minnesota Press, 1999), pp. 1–12. Badiou argues  that Deleuze and Guattari’s concept of ontological univocity should not be understood  simply in its most anarchic and “free flowing” aspects, as if they only and simply valorize  becoming. He notes, rather, that flows inevitably reterritorialize. This interpretation of  Deleuze and Guattari suggests that Hardy’s critique of becoming actually accords with  the univocity of being that they posit. Yet the narrative limitations that Hardy invokes  to summon a liberal conception of agency suggests that his perspective on becoming  would more closely approximate Hallward’s.

The concepts of nature and culture need  serious reworking, in a way that expresses the irreducible alterity  of the nonhuman in and through its active connection to the hu- man and vice versa. (Parables for the Virtual, p. 39) Massumi claims that becoming yields access to immanent on- tological continuity, or “dynamism,” that renders otherness  permeable, but he also negotiates an inviolate respect for alter- ity. For Hardy, however, the nonhuman is allowed to be un- derstood as just such a construct of human culture in order to  be rescued. The depiction of a more static vision of nature— nature as suffering and victimized—secures particular and con- crete ethical goals, even if it limits lyrical flexibility.41 For Hardy, although sympathy across the boundary of species  becomes an ethical imperative as the agency associated with cri- tique makes it possible, generating sympathy for animals in writ- ing means the loss of narrative breadth. in other words, the need  to produce an account of human agency in relation to animals  produces a narrowed experiential field, grounding ethics by con- tracting animality to the ability to experience pain and stressing  41 Recent Deleuzian theorists, particularly Massumi, envision an ethics associated  with becoming—“a political knowledge-practice that takes an inclusive, nonjudgmen- tal approach to tending belonging-together in an intense, affectively engaged way is an  ethics. . . . Political ecology is an amoral collective ethics” (Parables for the Virtual, p. 255).  it is unclear, however, how “ecology” can constitute an ethics, especially if it cannot be  communicated or even fully acknowledged without conflicting with the ontological  continuity on which such an ecology is based. Reading Hardy against Massumi, how- ever, indicates that becoming cannot be bent to ethics if ethics continues to be under- stood as entailing an epistemology of encounter. and although Hardy offers a vision of  transformative coexistence suited to Massumi’s, he puts in place aesthetic limitations  to secure what he deems ethical goals. Doing so retains the specific environmental pur- chase of “ecology”—Hardy can condemn the ecological damage caused by farming and  hunting, whereas Massumi makes the term “ecology” bear so much rhetorical weight  that it is no longer relevant to motivating or condemning specific practices.

Ultimately, Hardy insists on applying the language of ethics to  human and animal suffering, and this language brings with it  terms of character—individuality, humanity—disavowed by theo- rists of becoming. Hardy cannot portray living beings as fluidly  in process and as separate, if separateness and privileged human  consciousness are understood as necessary to environmental and  social critique. He thus distinguishes an aesthetic that can explore  becoming-animal from one organized around the production of  sympathy. although humans are capable of both radical reimag- inings of their own animality and compassion for the suffering of  animals, Hardy’s ethical turn indicates that the critique of cruelty  is not served by the discourse of becoming-animal. Finally, then, the affirmation of the ethical register in Tess  of the D’Urbervilles looks forward to the more austere, dialogic  structure of Jude the Obscure. animals appear in Jude solely in  the ethical sense, as Jude urges that we “have a little pity on  the creature.” Most vividly, Jude’s failure to slaughter a pig hu- manely highlights the pig’s anthropomorphic “rage” and “de- spair,” feelings that echo Jude’s own.42 The episode thus valo- rizes Jude’s sensitivity as opposed to arabella’s brutality. His  social world, of course, is not ready to host that sensitivity, and  tends to collapse Jude’s intensity of care into unintended indif- ference. at this point Hardy sought to establish a new, prag- matic application of his fiction to an explicitly ethical endeavor  by offering the pig-killing section of Jude to the publication  Animals’ Friend, where it was reprinted as “a Merciful Man” in  December 1895. although, as lucy Bending argues, Jude “is  born to suffer not just because it is part of the human condi- tion to suffer, but because of his ability to feel with the seem- ing sufferings of lower creation,”43 the steps that Jude takes to  alleviate animal suffering provide clear moral assessment and  advocate a model of evaluative responsibility for care, even if  that model faces severe practical challenges.

Despite its dire conclusion and stress on in- herited flaws, Jude offers reinvigorated expectations of human  agency—critical evaluation, an imperative of care—while it re- linquishes the mode of writing that decenters the human in  tantalizingly transformative ways. although this view of Jude the  Obscure might seem to run counter to its infamous pessimism,  perhaps this explains why Hardy reflected: “‘Jude’ . . . makes  for morality more than any other book i have written.”44 Johns Hopkins University abstract Elisha Cohn, “‘No insignificant creature’: Thomas Hardy’s Ethical  Turn” (pp. 494–520)  This essay examines the limitations of ethically motivated representations of animals  in Victorian realism. as many critics have argued, evolutionary theory’s challenge to  human supremacy had the potential to alter radically literature’s focus on individual  subjectivity and social ideals. in particular, the new relevance of animals to human life  threatened to deflate the human moral ideals. The treatment of animals in Victorian  literature is rarely interpreted as exploring evolution’s radically anti-humanist implica- tions. More often, animals are thought to function as objects of sympathy in a larger  project of constructing middle-class subjectivity. as i argue, it is important to account  for the relationship between the sympathetic and the anti-humanist representation of  animals in Victorian works. The changing role of animals in Thomas Hardy’s works  highlights the disconnect between the radical implications that critics see in evolution- ist thought and the way in which animals in Victorian writings are usually construed  as objects of sympathy. Tess of the D’Urbervilles (1891) places these two approaches in  conversation by shifting emphasis from a destabilizing lyricism associated with human- animal affinity to a more distanced narrative stance associated with human autonomy,  sympathy, responsibility, and critique. Examining how Hardy grounds his ethically  motivated expectations of stable human agency after having seemingly dispensed with  them suggests the need for a distinction between a lyrical, evolutionist aesthetic and an  ethical aesthetic. This approach also offers insight into the enabling conditions—and  limitations—shaping sympathetic agency in defense of animal lives. in examining the  intersections between Hardy’s work and recent approaches to theories of animality,  particularly those based on Gilles Deleuze’s concept of becoming-animal, Tess helps  us to rethink the theory, to understand why ethical claims require boundaries between  species, and on what basis these boundaries can be legitimated.
