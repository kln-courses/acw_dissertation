<plain_text><page sequence="1">"OLMEC" HEAD SHAPES AMONG THE PRECLASSIC PERIOD MAYA AND CULTURAL MEANINGS Vera Tiesler This paper analyzes the biographical and related archaeological information of 10 artificially shaped skulls from the broader Maya area, which bear resemblance to the high and narrow head morphology depicted in Olmec art. The skeletal evidence of this head form, which was accomplished by combining compression cradleboards with constricting horizontal wraps (tabular erect type in its pseudo-circular variety), is rare and predates A.D. 250 in all cases. Here I compare the cra nial vaults shaped in this fashion with that of 49 other Preclassic period Maya indivisuals from different parts of the Maya world. The discussion explores the possible evolving social and religious roles of this emblematic body modification. I argue that Olmecoid head modification was a syncretic cultural adoption, since it was just one of many expressions of a deeply embedded Preclassic tradition, still practiced centuries after the demise ofOlman's societies themselves. The visible effect of the artificial pear-shaped heads most likely reflected gradual shifting ideological schemes, probably emulating early ver sions of the Maya Maize God, given the resemblance to Preclassic period renderings of this supernatural force. Este artwulo analiza la information biogrdfica y contextual de 10 crdneos mayas culturalmente modificados, cuya forma arti ficial se asemeja a la de las cabezas altas y angostas representadas en el arte olmeca. La evidencia esqueletica de esta forma cefdlica, producida mediante el empleo conjunto de cunas deformatorias y bandas constrictoras (tipo tabular erecto en su modalidadpseudo-circular), es escasa hasta lafecha y en todos los casos data de antes de 250 d.C. Aqui comparo las bovedas modificadas del modo olmeca con la forma de otros 49 crdneos precldsicos, procedentes de diferentes regiones dentro del area maya. La discusion explora los posibles significados sociales y religiosos de esta prdctica en el dmbito cultural maya del Pre cldsico. Se argumenta que el modelado cefdlico olmecoide constituia solo una entre muchas expresiones de una tradition cotidiana ya muy arraigada. Propongo que tambien la permanencia de modelados del modo olmeca en diferentes partes del territorio maya hasta tiempo despues del ocaso de Olman, apunta hacia una adoption sincretica de la prdctica. Su efecto visual debena haber seguido esquemas ideoldgicos en transition, probablemente emulando versiones tempranas del dios maya del Maiz, para despues convertirse en las cabezas alargadas y reclinadas del Cldsico que mas tarde personificarian a esta fuerza sobrenatural en los territorios al este del Soconusco. The artificial shaping of infants' heads is a permanent, highly visible body modifica tion that has been practiced cross-culturally to demonstrate kinship, ethnicity, status, and gen der (Blom 2005; Dembo and Imbelloni 1938; Dingwall 1931; Torres-Rouff 2002). Unlike most other body modification practices, cranial vault modeling bridges the generations, since it is car ried out by second- or third-generation adult prac titioners on infants who then carry the resulting head form for their whole life. This protracted, conservative quality raises the social importance of this practice above that of more ephemeral body fashions and turns it into an enormously useful trait for examining long-term processes and emblems of ancestry and group identity. Furthermore, arti ficial head shaping leaves traces in archaeologi cally derived skeletal series and therefore can be studied and contextualized directly from the mate rial record. This possibility lends to bioarchaeo logical approaches, which, when grouped with other data sets, are ideally suited to inform about the experienced reality of the past (Tiesler 2007). This is the approach of choice also of this paper. Anchored in contextualized cranial evidence from the broader Maya area and grounded in cognitive approaches and Mesoamerican ideological schemes, it explores the roles of Maya cranial Vera Tiesler Facultad de Ciencias Antropologicas, Universidad Autonoma de Yucatan, Facultad de Ciencias Antropologicas, km 1.00 carretera Merida-Tizimm, Merida CP. 97305, Yucatan, Mexico, Tel.

Head Modeling in Ancient Maya Society Among the ancient Maya?and in fact much of Mesoamerica?cranial vault modification consti tutes a widely spread and deeply rooted tradition that was practiced at all levels of society over a span of several millenia (Romano 1974; Stewart 1975:208-224; Tiesler 1998,1999a, 1999b).1 This popular custom, which was carried out through massages, cradleboards, head compression devices, and constricting bands, led to astoundingly het erogeneous visual results. Already seventy years ago, Earnest Hooton noted on the skulls retrieved by Edward H. Thompson from the Sacred Cenote of Chichen Itza that "the varieties of cranial defor mation are so numerous that they are bewildering" (Hooton 1940:273). This appraisal has been echoed by more recent Maya scholarship, at least for the Classic period (Stewart 1975:222; Tiesler 1998, 1999a; Tiesler and Romano 2008). If we believe the archaeological record, infant head modeling was practiced in the broader Maya territory at least by 1000 B.C. The earliest cases of lambdoid flattening and tabular oblique shaping, documented in Altar de Sacrificios, Guatemala (Xe Phase) and in Cuello, Belize (Swasey/Bladen phase), date to the late Early and early Middle Pre classic period (Saul 1972:107; Saul and Saul 1991:153-155). A millennium later, artificial skull shaping had already turned into an almost gener alized practice with the majority of Classic period vaults (85.42 percent, N = 295) showing signs of cultural modification (Tiesler 1999a:223).2 To pro duce these deformations, the ancient Maya used cradleboards, cephalic apparatuses, and related implements, sometimes combined with compres sion bands, massages, and?albeit rarely?also the abrasion of the occipal bone.3 Regarding the possible social motives behind this body tradition with its highly visible results, there is to date no conclusive evidence in the archae ological record that might suggest that the artifi cial head forms adhere to status or gender distinctions (see Tiesler 1998:185-188; Tiesler 1999a:220-235; Tiesler and Benedict 2001 for sta tistical examination on a regional level). Neither have other ideological or ethnic motives been con clusively identified that could account for the var ied choices of head shapes during the Classic period (A.D. 250-900), a time that witnessed a peak in the diversity of splinting and wrapping techniques and their combinations. I have argued in previous works (Tiesler 1999a:327-330; Tiesler 2005; Tiesler 2009a) that this diversity, which shows up both within and between settlements and among regions, could have been the outcome of family or com munity traditions, passed on by generations of female practitioners. Apart from diversity, we can notice broad regional preferences for distinct head forms. Slanted heads seem more popular in the western sphere of the Maya Lowlands and along the coastal fringes, while erect head forms were in vogue in the Guatemaltecan Highlands and parts of the Lower and Middle Usumacinta region, namely in Palenque. Nevertheless, at least before the onset the second millennium A.D., these pref erences have to be interpreted only as ratios of cradleboard vs. splinting traditions, not in terms of homogeneity vs. heterogeneity.4 Similar to the Classic period traditions, uncer tainty also marks our present understanding of the role held by cranial modifications during the Pre classic period, although evidence is mounting that links some of the skull shapes of Preclassic east ern Mesoamerica visually to the Olmec head iconography known from the Gulf Coast. The evi dence goes back to Arturo Romano's seminal study on a skull from Pampa el Pajon from the coastal plains of Chiapas, dated to the Middle Preclassic, which bears a striking resemblance to the pear shaped head morphology of the anthropomorphic carvings from the Gulf Coast Olmec heartland (identified also as "Olman"), leading the author to speak of an "Olmec" cranial modification (Romano 1977a, 1980:114). Alterations of this type in Pre classic period skulls from the Maltrata area in high land Veracruz have been described (Carlos Serrano, personal communication 2001). Also in the broader Maya territory, this visual outcome of cranial vault manipulation must have been known on a regional scale, as my own research suggests. Over the years, I have documented nine skulls with artificially pro duced Olmecoid head shapes that date to the Pre classic period and add to the specimen from Pampa el Pajon described by Romano (see Tiesler 1998:192-195; Tiesler and Rodriguez 2009) (Fig ure 1).

Map of eastern Mesoamerica with names of sites mentioned in the text. archaeological sites, two of them located in Low land Guatemala, and the other three in the Mexi can states of Chiapas and Yucatan. In the following, I will address the overall dis tribution, prevalence, trends, and changing cultural implications of "Olmec" head shaping among Pre classic Maya settlers. I provide case descriptions for individuals displaying Olmecoid head forms and compare them to other coeval vault shapes from the broader Maya area. Correlating the bur ial information with chronological and spatial assignments, I provide a broad sketch of the evo lution of this form of cranial modification in the Maya area until its apparent abandonment prior to A.D. 250. The discussion traces the origins and possible mythological significance of pear-shaped heads in the Olmec heartland. The potential role that this symbolically laden head form played dur ing the centuries to come in the Maya area is con fronted with different scenarios of late supra-regional Olmec and epi-Olmec interaction, aspiring to contribute to the present Olmec debate (see Pool 2007:12-17; Stark 2000). I go on to trace the evolving social and religious importance of pear-shaped vault modification within the Maya area itself. I explore the practice conceptually as an integral part of deeply embedded daily traditions, which is confronted with gradually shifting ide</page><page sequence="4">Tiesler] HEAD SHAPES AMONG THE PRECLASSIC PERIOD MAYA AND CULTURAL MEANINGS 293 ologies, autochtonous customs vs. syncretic cul tural adoption, and the possible emulations of supernatural entities. The interpretation builds on interdisciplinary data analysis and is inspired by biocultural schemes and cognitive approaches (see, for example, Houston et al. 2006; Lopez-Austin 1989; Tiesler 2007), which are combined to con tribute fruitfully to the discussion of Maya socio cultural and religious evolvement during the Preclassic period. Techniques and Taxonomic Criteria This study forms part of a larger, ongoing, project that aspires to provide a representative coverage of head shaping in the Maya area from the skeletal record and associated contextual and graphic doc umentation. To this end a cohort of 1,918 relatively well-preserved skulls from 149 site collections from the circum-Maya area have been systemati cally scrutinized for head shaping so far (see Tiesler 1999a, 2009a). To evaluate the presence, degree, and type of cultural deformation in the skeletal record, I employ a range of detailed nonmetric cri teria and combine them with metric parameters when possible. The shape, extent, severity, and anatomical relationship are described for each com pression plane and constriction groove. General morphological attributes, which are relevant for scoring artificial modification, were also included: basic vault measurements, foraminal clivus, anatomical location of vertex, distance of opis tocranium from lambda and opistion, bilateral bulging vs. reduction of bilateral width, the degree and side of vault asymmetries (bipolar plagiocra nia), and the presence, form, and severity of supra inial lesions. The present classification of artificially modified head shapes is based on a taxonomy established orig inally by Jose Imbelloni (1938; Dembo and Imbel loni 1938) and adjusted to Mesoamerican modification practices by Romano (1965), and Tiesler (1998,1999a). This system, which is in com mon use now to characterize Mesoamerican artifi cially modified head shapes, categorically distinguishes between tabular forms, attributed to the application of hard compression instruments, and the annular type, brought about by constriction bands, single strings, bandaging, or tightly adjusted hats. While the fitting of free compression boards on the infant head usually leads to oblique tabular forms, cradleboards are associated with tabular erect shapes that lead to high and broad heads (Figure 2). The duration of compression forces and the amount of pressure determine the severity of the morphologi cal changes. Besides intermediate and extreme mod ifications, slight forms of anterior-posterior reduction describe either lambdic (tabular erect occipital plane), occipital (tabular oblique frontal curve), or frontal flattening (tabular erect frontal plane or tab ular oblique occipital curve). In these slight modifi cations, the opposing compression plane is much less visible and might not even be recognized (see Dembo andlmbelloni [1938] and Ding wall [1931] for ethno graphic and ethnohistorical references; see also top row of Figure 2). Irregularities in the application of the compression devices, mostly cradleboards, can lead to severe cranial asymmetries, while pads, put underneath the compression boards, may lead to sin uous skull contours. Headboards or cradles may be combined with constricting bands, which lead to sulci (i.e. shal low depressions running lengthwise) on the vault's external surface.5 The joint application of horizon tal head wraps and rigid tablets cause "pseudo circular" oblique tabular modifications, which lead to elongated, tubular vaults with slanted foreheads. Conversely, pseudo-circular tabular erect shapes (identified here with the Olmec form of artificial cranial modification), are attained by combining tight bandages with cradleboard compression. In this modeling procedure, the rigid planes lead to an upward movement of the vault, while the cir cumferential pressure exerted by the horizontal headband restricts the skull's bilateral expansion in the upper temporal area and may lead to a visible division into an upper and a lower lobe and bulging of the lower half of the occiput (Romano 1980:96). The appearance of the narrow forehead that results from this process is either bulgy or vertical. The occipital chord tends to have a concave contour when viewed in profile and its upper part may show a back slant (see first skull profile of Figure 2's bot tom row; see also Figure 3). The overall form of the cranium that is produced through this proce dure may be described as pear-shaped or high and tubular, just like the pear-shaped head style depicted in Olmec imagery. In the following, I will refer to these skull shapes as "Olmecoid," "Olmec style," or "Olmec type."</page><page sequence="5">294 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 21, No. 3, 2010 A B Figure 2. Varieties of tabular erect head shapes documented in the Maya region (A), varieties of tabular oblique head shapes documented in the Maya region (B). Dashed lines indicate unmodified skull shape. In addition to the information regarding head form, I scored biographic and contextual data for each specimen. In determining the sex and age-at death of the skulls reported here, I employed the common parameters described in Buikstra and Ubelaker (1994), complemented by metric dis crimination of unique and multiple variables, when available (Buikstra and Ubelaker 1994; Steele and Bramblett 1988; Tiesler 1999a: 123-142; Wrobel et al. 2002). A range of correlatives for social dis tinction was scored systematically in each burial context, broadly following the classification put forth by Krejci and Culbert (1995; see also Tiesler 1999a: 105-106).6 Figure 3.

Apart from relevant craniological information, sex, and age-at-death, burial context and chronology have been documented (see also Table 1). Pampa el Pajon, Chiapas, Mexico (Burial 1) Arturo Romano (1977a, 1980) reports an artifi cially shaped skull from Pampa el Pajon, dated to the Encanto Phase (750/700-600 B.C.), which belongs to the only skeleton reported from this estuarine center on the pacific coastal plain of Chi apas with ties to La Venta (Pailles 1987:93). The corpse had been buried faced-down in an extended position. No artifacts were found buried with the skeleton; nonetheless, its burial location in the upper portion of the large and central El Encanto Mound led the author to believe that the interred was a privileged adolescent male (see also Salas 1980:93). The severe tabular erect modification displayed by the skull vault had been produced by combin ing a cradling device with a horizontal wrap (Fig ure 3). The prolonged immobilization within the cradleboard during the compression period had caused greater pressure on the left anterior and right posterior portions of the vault and resulted in cra nial asymmetry, a common side effect of head shap ing in cradles. The constricting action of the cloth increased the upward growth of the compressed head, while effectively limiting its bilateral expan sion. An almost horizontal groove was left by the circumferential constriction in the upper mastoid and asterion surfaces, which visibly separates the skull into an upper and a lower lobe (Romano 1980:96). Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas, Mexico (Burial 144, Burial 147, Burial 154) Not far from Pampa el Pajon, on the fringes of the Grijalva river, lies Chiapa de Corzo. Its strategic location explains its importance within the Isth mus/Maya intersection as early as the Middle Pre classic period (Lowe and Agrinier 1960). The explorations led here by the New World Archaeo logical Foundation between 1955 and 1965 uncov ered some 168 burials, which were studied by the author at the INAH headquarters of physical anthro polgy (Agrinier 1964; see Tiesler 1998:139-140, 1999a). Of the 32 skulls that were sufficiently well preserved for evaluation, some 24 date to the Pre classic or Protoclassic period.

Burial 144 corresponds to a simple pit that con tained the skeleton of a probably female adult, which was partly covered with red pigment. The individual had been buried together with travertine earflares and domestic vessels (Agrinier 1964:37). Her head had been shaped slightly with a cradle board device. No bipolar bulging is evident, sug gesting that the antero-posterior compression had been combined with bandages. Burial 147 con tained the remains of a young woman interred with a spindle whorl made from a ceramic sherd (Agrinier 1964:40). Her posterior skull vault, mod eled in a cradleboard, displays acute lambdoid flat tening. Bulging of the lower occiput (xyphobasia) was noted. Both temporal regions show a narrow horizontal sulcus, suggesting that the hard model ing device had been combined with a constricting headband. The circular wrap reduced the bilateral width of the cranium and also likely led to bone thinning above the occipital protuberance. Struc ture 5a-I3 was also used to rebury the bones of a young man together with remains of at least one child (Burial 154). The frontal bone of the male is severely flattened as is the posterior portion of the vault. No bilateral bulging is evident, indicating that the compression tablets were combined with a con stricting band. Altar de Sacrificios, El Peten, Guatemala (Burial 13, Burial 124) This site from the Lower Pasion area served as a major trade center already during the Late Pre classic period. Here, Harvard's Peabody Museum led explorations that recovered a wealth of well documented burials (N = 136), which cover more than two millennia of continuous occupation (Smith 1972).7 Of the six individuals that predate A.D. 250, Burials 13 and 124, both of them sim ple primary interments, stand out as showing the combined effects of cradleboard and headband use. Burial 13 dates vaguely pre-A.D. 150 (probably San Felix phase, possibly Late Plancha phase) (Smith 1972:245). The restored, narrow cranium of Burial 13 belongs to a mature male. It displays a slight flattening of the frontal bone and a straight posterior compression surface, together with baso occipital bulging (xyphobasia) and vault asymme try. In this case, the hard compression device exerted pressure on the skull along with both cir cular and antero-posterior constricting bands. The vault modification of Burial 124, probably a young female, was dated to the late Middle Preclassic (San Felix phase: 600-300 B.C.) (Smith 1972:265-266). Its vault modification is similar to that of Burial 13. In this case the expression of the posterior compression plane also dominates the skull shape with a horizontal sulcus above the mas toid area proving that circular wraps had been used. Seibal, El Peten, Guatemala (Burial 11) Located about 60 km east of Altar de Sacrificios on the southern fringes of the Central Maya Low lands, Seibal was explored by the Peabody Museum of Harvard University (Tourtellot 1990). During its early phases of occupation in the Middle Preclas sic, there is evidence of interaction with Highland Guatemala and contact with the Olmec region (Tourtellot 1990:235-241). Burial 11 is the earli est skeleton recovered from the site, dating to the Escoba Mamon phase (600-300 B.C.). The grave was occupied by a middle-aged male adult, whose incisors displayed Ik-shaped dental filing (reduc tion of the lateral edges of both central incisors that simulates a 'T' in the upper dentition). No objects were found with the interred. His skull vault shows a tabular erect flattening in the frontal and in the lambdoid area. In this case, a wide, shallow con striction groove is evident in the posterior portions of both parietal bones, dividing the cranium into an upper and a lower lobe (Figure 4). Dzibilchaltun, Yucatan, Mexico (Burial M-871 A) This large site, which had already emerged as a cen tral settlement by the Middle Preclassic period, was the subject of a comprehensive archaeological investigation by The Middle American Research Institute (MARI) (Andrews and Andrews 1980). The burial described from this research consists of a simple pit interment without an offering from El Mirador's Structure 605-7. Curiously, this speci men was not included in an earlier study on this skeletal series by T. Dale Stewart (1975), who did provide an extensive description of the artificially modified head shapes of all other preserved indi viduals from the MARI explorations. The restored and marked remains from the MARI work are now</page><page sequence="8">Tiesler] HEAD SHAPES AMONG THE PRECLASSIC PERIOD MAYA AND CULTURAL MEANINGS 297 Figure 4. Burial 11, Seibal, Peten, Guatemala. Tabular erect pseudo-circular skull in left and posterior view (photographs taken by Vera Tiesler). housed at the INAH Center of Yucatan, where the author documented Burial M-871A (Xculul phase: 50-250 B.C.) (Tiesler 1998). It corresponds to a robust middle-aged male, whose high, narrow skull displays strong lambdoid flattening and a wide groove left by a horizontal constricting headband (Figure 5). Its bilateral width had been noticeably reduced by the bandaging. Caucel, Yucatan, Mexico (Burial 1/Str. 52, Burial 2/Str. 1094) Recently, the salvage excavations of Fernando Ro bles and his INAH team at Caucel, which lies on the outskirts of Merida, have produced a skeletal series of more than 20 individuals (Monica Rodriguez, personal communication 2009). Their study has led to the discovery of two more speci mens in the peninsula, which emulate the artificial head morphology expressed by Olmec figurines (Tiesler 2009b; Tiesler and Rodriguez 2009). The preliminary results from the work at Caucel indi cate a large settlement with ties to the North Coast that saw its major occupation during the Middle Preclassic, although it continued to be inhabited until at least the Early Classic period (Robles and Ligorred 2008; see also Andrews and Robles 2008). The first specimen belonging to Burial 1 was recovered from Structure 52 of the site, together with Dzudzuquil Group ceramics, which ties this context to the Early Nabanche phase (800/700 B.C.-400/300 B.C.), making it the earliest skull shaped in Olmec fashion to have been documented in the Yucatec Peninsula. It belongs to a robust young or middle-aged adult male. The anterior compression plane visibly flattens the middle half of the frontal bone. The dorsal flattening, more pro nounced than the anterior one (occipital plane vari ant), produced a straight dorsal plane, which dominates the back of the head. As in earlier exam ples, the hard compression device led to vault asym metry. A horizontal groove is visible in dorsal view and accentuated by the unnaturally reduced bipo lar width of the vault (Figure 6). No supra-inial lesion was observed. The second skull from Caucel comes from Bur ial 2 of Structure 1094, the simple pit interment of a male adult, dated to Late Nabanche (400/300 B.C.-A.D. 250). In this case, the slight artificial erect modification led to the basal bulging of the lower portion of the occipital bone (xifobasia), while a wide and shallow horizontal sulcus was noted in the asterion areas. Again, the width of the vault appears unnaturally reduced by the circum ferential constriction.

In a scale of "0" (lowest correlate for social dis tinction) to "5" (highest correlate for social distinc tion), these burials rank on average .6 (N= 10), which adheres roughly to the average of coeval contexts with non-Olmecoid head shapes of .67 (N = 36). The 10 individuals with Olmecoid vault modi fications belong to adolescent or adult individuals of both sexes. Males strongly outnumber females (70 percent vs. 30 percent; N = 10) in a proportion that is similar to the sexed non-Olmecoid cohort of the same time range (69.57 percent vs. 30.43 per cent; N = 46). This bias is also observed in many Classic skeletal series from the Maya area and could be the result of differentiated burial practices, which have given priority to male individuals in the cer emonial precincts and site cores (being the same locations that receive priority from archaeological excavation), as scholarship has argued (see Krejci and Culbert 1999:104, for discussion). From the perspective of physical anthropology, other factors certainly may contribute to this bias (see also Wright 2006:30-34). Since bone mass, size, and density are important intrinsic factors in the sur vival of bone elements, gracile female skeletons are prone to be less preserved than those of taller, robust males (Galloway et al. 1997), which reduces the possibility of positively sexing the former. Gener ally speaking, the extremely deteriorated, frag mented human remains that characterize most archaeological Lowland skeletal series lack most primary diagnostic features in the iliac bones or the skull, which in the past has led scholarship to rely heavily on nonmetric general features such as degree of robusticity from long bones. Degree of robusticity, again, is easier to tie to males than to females. Geographically, the 10 Olmecoid skulls origi nate from three distinct areas within the broader Maya area, although the limited number of speci mens does not allow for generalizations (Figure 1). Three of them come from the northern part of the Yucatan peninsula (Dzibilchaltun and Caucel). Another three Olmecoid vaults issue from the Pasion area in the southern part of the Central Maya Lowlands (Seibal and Altar de Sacrificios), and four more were recorded for the western fringes of the Maya world, towards the Isthmus corridor (Pampa el Pajon, Chiapa de Corzo). Revealingly, the 10 crania with Olmecoid vault shape constitute only one of several different vault forms that were in vogue before the onset of the Classic period. This diversity in skull shapes is also evident within the regions and even within the sites that perform Olmec type shaping. To explore this aspect further, I compared the nine skulls I scored myself that were modified in Olmec fashion to other Preclas sic period specimens from the overall skeletal record (N=58). The 58 of the 59 skulls included in this investigation (46 of which could be sexed, see abovementioned sex distribution) come from 16 settlements in the larger Maya area (Figure 7a-c). Possible inter-observer errors were avoided, since all skeletons were analyzed by the author.8 Intra observer error was kept to a minimum by scoring most specimens twice and by multiple checks on data congruence following the taxonomic criteria already outlined. Two of three individuals from Kaminaljuyu, who have been ascribed to the (Middle or Late) Pre classic period, display slight irregular frontal flat tening, probably resulting from the use of tumplines at an early age. These cases were excluded from the cohort of artificially shaped crania along with the third skeleton from Kaminaljuyu, which dis played no signs of artificial vault modification. Col lectively, the artificially modified skull vaults from the Maya regional record make up 77.59 percent (Af = 45) of the Preclassic series. The other 13 cra nia (including the three skulls from Kaminaljuyu) did not show any evidence of artificial head mod eling. The Preclassic period skulls included in this study represent a fraction of larger site collections, which are mostly ascribed to the (Late) Classic period. Since most of the site samples did not include a sufficient number of scored specimens, a systematic site-by-site reconstruction of evolv ing shaping preferences was deemed problematic. For the purposes of this investigation, I therefore provide only one broad outline of head shaping, as observed in Chiapa de Corzo, the largest collection with Preclassic period specimens available. In the earliest of its 23 scored Preclassic specimens there are five skulls that date to the Middle or Early Late Preclassic (Francesa Phase: 450-250 B.C.), three of which show artificial vault modification (60 per</page><page sequence="11">300 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 21, No. 3, 2010 Figure 7.

In each case, the head modeling was pro duced by splints combined with compression wraps (tabular oblique type). Moving toward the Proto classic period (Guanacaste and Istmo Phases: 300 B.C.-A.D. 200, 15 out of 18 skulls demonstrate artificial shaping (83.33 percent), suggesting a rise in popularity of this practice. In this period, hard compression devices are still almost always com bined with constricting headbands, while formal and technical diversity is enhanced with the intro duction of cradleboards (with three tabular erect types vs. nine tabular oblique types). In all three cases, the cradleboards were combined with head wraps that led to pear-shaped head forms, as described above. In any case, either erect or slanted, all heads from the first two centuries A.D. still appear narrow and unnaturally high in Chiapa de Corzo. A change in head form is noted only later, during the Early and Late Classic periods when the cephalic compression devices, commonly used before, appear to have been completely replaced by cradleboards and the circular headbands replaced by saggital bands. These technical inno vations led to dramatic changes in head form: the population of Chiapa de Corzo begins to display shorter and unnaturally broad, protuberant heads. A saggital groove visibly separates the parietal lobes in some of the Classic period skulls from this site, still enhancing the impression of head width. When considered on a pan-Maya scale, the cran iological information reveals more general patterns in the artificial vault modifications.9 The skeletal record consulted for this study suggests that dur ing the Preclassic and Protoclassic periods, artifi cial skull forms were already produced by using either cradleboards or head apparatuses. Occa sionally, the hard compression devices were used in combination with tight saggital or horizontal bands. When chronologically sequenced, the results show clear long-term trends in head forms, tech niques, and shaping devices in the Maya region on the dawn of the Classic period. The shifting pro portion between erect and oblique types toward the Classic period indicates that cradleboards were gradually replaced by splinting traditions. With the notable exception of Chiapa de Corzo, this change resulted in a growing proportion of reclined, slanted heads towards the Protoclassic and, more so, Early Classic period, as seen in Figure 8. Regarding the Olmec type skulls under study, these appear to have been most popular during the Middle Preclassic period (Figure 9).10 That is when the effects of tight wrapping still show up in more than half of the artificially modified vaults. Further along the timeline, infants' heads continued to be wrapped with constraining headbands, but now wrapping practices had become increasingly tied to splinting traditions, producing the slanted, tubu lar heads known from Classic period portraiture and the cranial record.

Olmec-style combined use of cradleboards and constricting headbands is abandoned altogether, at least according to the present state of skeletal proof from the Maya territory. This substitution of pseudo-circular tabular erect shapes by other arti ficial head forms is statistically highly significant when Preclassic and Classic data are compared (chi square analysis, p = .000), pointing towards a cul turally motivated replacement through the cen turies. Discussion: Meanings of Olmecoid Head Shapes in the Broader Maya Area Although the cultural remnants left by Olman's people is geographically limited to the Soconusco region and the Gulf Coast territories of lower Ver acruz and Tabasco, Olmec or Olmecoid objects, symbols, and styles circulated through most of Mesoamerica during the Preclassic period, includ ing many areas within the broader Maya area.

By all accounts, exchange between the Olmec (or their intermediaries) with populations east of the Soconusco must have been intense during the Mid dle Preclassic period and was most likely accom panied by a rich intellectual exchange of worldviews, ritual schemes and possibly also lifestyle preferences (Diehl 2004:135-15). The per vasive nature of this interaction is illustrated by one common visible tradition: infant head model ing. As the previous account of the regional skele tal record indicates, the artificially pear-shaped vaults that evoke Olmec head renderings are tied chronologically and culturally to Olmecoid and Epi-olmec cultural phenomena. What were the motives that led families from different parts of the Maya territory to embrace Olmecoid head forms? In order to grasp the cul tural and possible ethnic and religious significance of Olmec type head rendering, first a word on the multifaceted purposes of this body practice itself is necessary. As is clear from the introduction, ancient Maya head shaping by hand or with the help of splints, cradleboards, and/or tightly wound cloth had always been a regular part of daily life. Moth ers, experienced midwives or other female kin were the ones most likely in charge of modifying the child's vault during the first few months or years of life, a time when the skull is still malleable. Cov ering, wrapping, rubbing, and molding the head of the frail newborn were considered essential to pro tect it against evil winds, disease, insanity, and ulti mately death (Tiesler 1998:32-33; see also Duncan 2009). These measures prepared the little one for his or her social integration later in childhood, which could be marked by hetz mek or naming cel ebrations. Figurines and anthropomorphic clay flutes, which could well have been used during these ceremonies, often depict infants with a com pression device still in place (Tiesler 1998:199-202, 1999a:328) (Figure 10). Apart from the longstanding ritual and organoplastic motives, there were probably other more resilient purposes for head shaping from very Figure 10. Anthropomorphic clay flute diplaying elderly woman with an infant on her lap who appears strapped into a cradleboard. Figure 0296 (unprovenienced Maya area), Museo del Popol Vuh, Guatemala City (photograph taken by Vera Tiesler). early on, prompted by the visual effect itself. As I have illustrated for the head trends witnessed in the Maya skull record, it is no coincidence that the Olmecoid head forms are ascribed to the Preclas sic era, to be replaced by other artificial head forms at the onset of the Classic period. Instead of being the unintended by-product of a child-rearing prac tice or merely an aesthetic choice, I argue that among the ancient Maya the visible outcome of head shaping must have been imbued with aggre gated emblematic meanings. Similar ideas are being put forth in studies on Classic period portraiture of the Maya pantheon (Ana Garcia Barrios, personal communication 2009). The impersonation of deity has already been proposed, for instance, to explain the elongated, slanted heads (produced by combining head com pression boards with constriction wraps), which appear to be the common denominator for head ren dering in much of the Maya Lowlands. Karl Taube (1992:46-50) identifies these reclined, almost tubu lar crania with the tonsured and foliated imagery of the Maize God. Stephen Houston and his col leagues (2006:45) take this argument a step further</page><page sequence="14">Tiesler] HEAD SHAPES AMONG THE PRECLASSIC PERIOD MAYA AND CULTURAL MEANINGS 303 by positing that the Classic Maya shaped their infants' heads?the head being one of the principal locuses of Maya identity? to emulate the corn shaped vault of the Maize God.11 Other authors have suggested that the elongated heads of the Classic period Maya embodied the sacred feline powers of thejaguar(SoteloandValverde 1992:210-213). On a broader Mesoamerican scale, the cube-like heads from El Zapotal, Veracruz (tabular erect para lelepiped shape, see second skull on the bottom row of Figure 2), have been identified with Goddess Tlazolteotl and the high converging cranial vaults of Postclassic Veracruz have been associated with Quetzalcoatl's conical cap (Romano 1977b, 1980:300; Tiesler and Romano 2008:24-25). Olmec art also expresses the relationship between humans and the supernatural world through visual means. These are especially visible in the imagery of the elites, as the emerging social hierarchy tied rulership to deified patronage (Diehl 2004:108). Although virtually no skeletal remains from the tropical substrates of the Veracruz and Tabasco plains have survived to inform us about the ancient head morphology of Olman's peoples, the realistic portraits, sculpted in figurines and mon umental stone carvings, provide a naturalistic, even individualistic, rendering of their head morphology. Such is the case with Manati's carved wooden heads, San Lorenzo's hollow figurines or La Venta's colossal sculptures. The heads, mostly displayed bald or shaven, many shown with a headband sit ting on the steep forehead, appear almost invari ably pear-shaped, narrow, and high, indicating artificial skull deformation (Figure 11; see also Cyphers and Villamar 2006). This is also the head morphology documented by Arturo Romano (1977a) for Pampa el Pajon and the skull shapes reported in this paper. Revealingly, more esoteric iconography also follows this syntax. Olmec anthropomorphic ren derings of supernatural creatures and forces, like the Maize God, the were-jaguar or the rain deities, are represented with unnaturally narrow, high heads, just like the wordly portraiture (Figure 12). The bulging or vertical contour of the forehead matches the equally erect, straight outline of the back of the head. The occipital protuberance is eliminated and the posterior portion of the vault appears reduced or eliminated altogether with the ear lobes delineating the back of the head. Within Figure 11. Terracotta head sculpture, San Lorenzo (Coe 1992:32; redrawn by Mirna Sanchez). this artistic convention, nuances are added by the V-shaped cleft that cuts into the top of the Rain and the Maize God's heads. Other illustrations draw a back slant on the top of the Corn Deity's vault or flanking foliation as described by Karl Taube (2000:298-299; see also Diehl 2004:108-125). Headbands were common both in the anthro pomorphic imagery of the supernatural and in that associated with Olman's rulers, leading scholars to suggest a link between the act of head wrapping and kingship and a role of headbands in the embod iment of religiously obtained political authority (Reilly 2006:12-15). Some authors go on to affirm that the intentionally altered heads by themselves were status markers or signs of elite birth (Cyphers 2009; Diehl 2004:122; Hansen 2005:63). Although there is to date no direct evidence to confirm or refute this statement for the Olmec heartland (for lack of a well-preserved human skeletal remains), I doubt that artificial shaping itself was status</page><page sequence="15">304 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 21, No. 3, 2010 Figure 12. Head profile of Olmec Maize God with trefoil maize sign, Rio Pesquero (A), and with a top slant, personify ing maize foliation, attributed to Tlapacoya, Veracruz (B). (Taube 2000:Figures le and 2f; redrawn by Mirna Sanchez). exclusive, especially considering that where head shaping was known in Preclassic Mesoamerica, it appears to be independent from status (Romano 1972, 1974; Tiesler 1998). Neither do I believe that the narrow pear-shaped head form by itself, which was probably the com mon denominator in deformation techniques among Olman's settlers, was refined or endowed with any social or political distinction for the indi viduals who bore it within their group. Ann Cyphers and Enrique Villamar (2006; Cyphers 2009) have concluded similarly in a recent study of Early For mative head figurines, arguing that the homoge nization of cranial modification practices should have promoted social cohesion and identity within San Lorenzo's territories, while marking non Olmecs visibly as outsiders. As for the settlers east of the Soconusco region, the contextual data indicate rather that it was one shape out of many shapes with no distinct consid eration in terms of grave structure, outfit, or corpse treatment. This point, together with the fact that head shaping was already a deeply ingrained fam ily tradition at the onset of the Middle Preclassic (and probably even well before), serves as an argu ment against it being an elitist practice. The idea that Olmecoid vault shapes were reproduced by female practitioners within a domestic domain makes strictly hierarchical determined connota tions equally unlikely. This notion is supported by the fact that heads of both female and male babies were the objects of Olmecoid shaping, decades before they reached an age suitable for crucial polit ical or religious roles in society. Considering the above, I advocate rather?at least for the territories east and south of Oman?that the emblematic meaning(s) ascribed to artificially molded heads must have been, in any case, inclusive of all seg ments of society. A complementary view is expressed by Cyphers (2009:12-16), who exam ines the pseudo-circular erect modification in fig urines from Mesoamerican territories outside the Gulf Coast (specifically the Basin of Mexico, Chal catzingo, and Oaxaca), as social identifiers with affinities to the Isthmian cultures, while interpret ing the formal heterogeneity as an expression of political decentralization and advent of new social schemes. One further issue considers the cultural dynam ics that led to the emulation of Olmecoid head</page><page sequence="16">Tiesler] HEAD SHAPES AMONG THE PRECLASSIC PERIOD MAYA AND CULTURAL MEANINGS 305 forms in the Middle Preclassic cultural domain. Much has been argued about the timing, the forms, and degrees of interaction between the Olmec heart land and different parts of the broader Maya area, an interaction which was probably as complex as the heterogeneous tapestry of political entities and probably ethnicities that occupied the eastern por tions of Mesoamerica at that time. Different forms of exchange between these peoples have been advo cated, such as commercial product trade, conquest, acculturation, and emulation of imported symbols (Cheetham et al. 2009; Clark 1990; Diehl 2004; Pool 2007). Pan-Mesoamerican forms of syn cretism have also been proposed, i.e., the incorpo ration of external symbolic elements into a coherent, essentially independent local or regional cultural repertoire, leading to dissemination and the sharing of Olmec symbols and beliefs all over Mesoamerica. Regarding the local imitation of Olmecoid head shapes, I have argued that pear shaped head trends were installed on already deeply engrained family traditions, in which the emulation of Olman's emblems was to blend in with other head motifs likely of more autochtonous origin. This situation speaks more of syncretic reinterpre tation of Olmec influx than of direct imposition. One more aspect that backs up this interpretation of the skeletal record is the fact that this atavistic form of head shaping continued in the cultural repertoire east of the Soconusco area long after the demise of Olmec societies themselves. One last issue concerns the potentially emblem atic meanings of Olmec head morphology in the Maya world, especially their potential role as emblems of supernatural entities. As said, the schol arly literature on Olmec iconography convincingly establishes ties between the human and the super natural world, which were ostensibly promoted by their rulers. In a similar vein, the head shapes rep resented in Preclassic Maya portraiture and ?as I argue? the actual head forms of the populations sharing the Maya territories, should bear testimony to the cosmovision of their creators. Karl Taube (1996:54-62) has made a case for the evolving ven eration of the Olmec Maize God in southeastern Mesoamerica, arguing that many Mesoamerican maize deities go back to Olmec Maize God proto types. The Classic period profiles of the Isthmian Maize God, like those that appear in the portraiture from Chiapa de Corzo, represent this deity with an erect cranial vault and a vertical forehead contour, similar to earlier Preclassic representations from the area (Taube 1996:Figure 19a-d). Conversely, the Classic version of the Maya Maize God tends to be portrayed with an elongated head form and a slanted forehead (Saturno et al. 2005:28; Taube 1992:Figures 20, 21). One of the paintings described by Taube (1992:Figure 21b) displays the tonsured Maize God in a naturalistic pose, exhibit ing a transverse post-coronary sulcus on the top of his shaved head (Figure 13). From the osteologist's perspective, this groove appears to be the result of irregular suture growth, a common by-product of the prolonged use of head compression boards act ing on the infant's expanding skull vault, which in this case suggests that the image is inspired by the real world and the origin of Maya Maize God's arti ficial head form, as produced through infant head modeling. Interestingly, the slanted, tubular head forms that characterize most Classic period representa tions of the Maya Maize God do not really appear until the onset of the Classic era. Preclassic period scenes still represent this supernatural force with an erect head shape and a steep forehead, resem bling Isthmian depictions or much earlier Olmec Corn God portraits (see for example Taube 1996:Figures 20 and 21). These conventions imi tate the Olmec type shapes described here. One sacred portrayal that illustrates the shift in the rendering of the Maize God's head is provided in the mythological scene from San Bartolo's recently discovered north wall mural. This intricate painting, dated to the Late Preclassic period (and most likely to the first century B.C.), depicts humanlike individuals who are probably engaged in the dressing of the Maize God, a commonly adopted mythological theme in Mesoamerica (Sat urno et al. 2005:51). According to the authors' inter pretation, the Maize God himself serves as the protagonist in the scene, and he is portrayed atavis tically in Olmec fashion (Saturno et al. 2005:25-31). His stylized face displays a jutting upper lip and buckteeth, while his high cranial vault is shown with a vertical forehead with a back loop on top ("a" in Figure 14).12 One of the females, ren dered in a more naturalistic fashion, has been iden tified as a Late Preclassic form of the Maya Corn Goddess. She displays a high head form and a head band sits on her bulging forehead, similar to the arti</page><page sequence="17">306 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 21, No. 3, 2010 Figure 13. Unprovenanced Late Classic Maya vase (Taube 1992:Figure 21b; redrawn by Mirna Sanchez). ficial Olmecoid shapes I described from the skele tal record ("b" in Figure 14). Instead of a back slant, the top of her head is crowned with a corn-curl (Sat urno et al. 2005:35, Figure 26). Three more skirted women, whose roles have not been accounted for by the authors, appear in assisting poses, as does a kneeling male. All four exhibit different head forms ("c"-"f' in Figure 14): The head of individual "c" seems to be unmodified, while individual "d" dis plays a markedly oblique head shape and a slanted forehead; the vault of the third female "e" appears to be shortened below the headdress suggesting a tabular erect shape. Lastly, the male, here identi fied with "f," displays a cranial form that is simi lar to that of individual "b." Jointly, the mythical portraiture of San Bartolo's north wall mural con firms the real diversity of head shapes as seen in the contemporary skeletal record and at the same time revindicates the late popularity of Olmecoid head shapes. The scene from San Bartolo therefore</page><page sequence="18">Tiesler] HEAD SHAPES AMONG THE PRECLASSIC PERIOD MAYA AND CULTURAL MEANINGS 307 Figure 14. Scene from San Bartolo's North Wall mural (Heather Hurst, central figures redrawn by Mirna Sanchez). establishes a powerful conceptual link between the evolution of artificial head shapes within the broader Maya area and potential aggregated mean ings from the supernatural. Here, it is the atavistic allusions to Olmec symbolism and the form of rep resentation of the Maize God's physical attributes ?and to a lesser degree to that of his female coun terpart, the ancestral Maize/Moon Goddess (Sat urno et al. 2005:34-38), which lend insights into the esoteric meaning of molding infants' cranial vaults artificially until their heads were pear shaped, narrow, and high. The evolving rendition of the Maize God's head shape, rooted deep within the Preclassic past, appears to mirror shifting pref erences in artificial head form within the broader Maya area and suggests indeed that this deeply imbedded body practice was already used in the early times to emulate the supernatural and imprint it on both male and female infants. This notion strengthens the contention that infant head shap ing served to forge identity not only in its ritual dimensions but also played a role as an emblem atic imitator of the supernatural that must have con ferred group identity equally to female and male offspring (an aspect that I have examined in previ ous work for Classic period Maya populations, based on much larger skeletal series [Tiesler 1998, 1999a, 2005]). Regarding the female practitioners of head shap ing in their communities, I wonder to what degree they intended to transmit these associated seman tic connotations, like those relating to Olmec Maize God prototypes. This idea still awaits thorough examination through the skeletal record and iconography. Similarly, the potential representa tion of other supernatural leitmotifs through the variety of later known artificial head shapes initi ates a line of research that promises to contribute fruitfully to the daily embrasure of the Maya pan theon. Conclusion In conclusion, the biocultural information provided by 10 Preclassic period skulls from all around the Maya area, explored in line with the regional bioar chaeological record and its imagery, has shown that Olmecoid art style and its associated meanings not only had visible effects on Preclassic period por traiture from the broader Maya world, but was emu lated also by the actual head shapes of many settlers. While the pear-shaped Olmec heads likely held deeper meanings within Olman itself, in the Maya area beyond the Soconusco, the reproduction of Olmecoid head forms likely expressed syncretic reinterpretations of the original ideological schemes, as I have argued in the discussion. Here, Olmecoid head modeling, together with other more autochtho nous visible results of this practice, should have constituted an inclusive, integral part of communal</page><page sequence="19">LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 21, No. 3, 2010 life in many parts of the Maya world during the Mid dle Preclassic period. Toward the onset of the Clas sic period it gradually lost popularity to be replaced by new head shaping practices, which were con current with shifts in ideological schemes. The visible reproduction of these models by generations of women over a span of at least a mil lennium not only provides a unique view on the many ways in which Olmec and Epi-Olmec cul tural and religious traits were adopted and incor porated into daily life, but also lends powerful insights into the role of the female practitioners in conferring family and group identity through this visible practice. In contrast to the Andean world, where cranial vault modifications convey consis tently ethnic and status distinctions (Blom 2005; Torres-Rouff 2002), the artificial head shaping con ducted by the Preclassic period Maya seems to emulate supernatural forces that accompanied and promoted ethnogenesis and forged Maya kin group identities during times of social change.

Ancient Mesoamerica 13:255-263. Notes 1. The terms "head shaping," "cranial vault modification," "cranial deformation,", "modeling," and "molding" are used synonymously here. 2. The proportions of artificially modified skulls reported here lie above some of the ratios documented by other authors for single-site series. For example, Frank Saul (1972:107) documents 27 skulls from Altar de Sacrificios, of which he considers five unmodified (18.52 percent), six further cases (22.22 percent) showing lambdoid flattening, and only 16 intentionally (sic) shaped skulls (59.26 percent). In Cuello, Belize, Saul and Saul (1991) document a similar ratio of 56.5 percent of culturally altered crania. The discrepancies between the lower frequencies obtained by Saul and the higher proportions scored by the author are likely the product of different classification systems and thresholds between assigning presence of vault modification or not. Also the dis tinction between "intentional" and "unintentional" modifica tions?employed in the literature to distinguish the unintended side-product of cradleboard use from those prac tices that deliberately changed the form of the infant's head? have turned out to be impractical when applied to the Maya area with its complex set of motivations and social functions for assigning identities (Duncan 2009; Tiesler 1999a; Tiesler and Romano 2008). 3. The latter led to an array of healed and unhealed occip ital lesions in the skeletal record from the Maya area, some times even complete bone penetration above inion, which display a similar morphology to cases reported from other parts of Mesoamerica and from the Andes (Lagunas 1974; Tiesler 2006; Weiss 1981). 4. Only then, broad and high skulls with flattened fore heads became the standard look throughout the Maya world and were the ones still documented by the European coloniz ers in the sixteenth century (Tiesler 1998:171-184). 5. Common are saggital grooves, for example, which divide the top of the vault from front to back into a left and a right hemisphere. Conversely, post-bregmatic sulcuses and lambdic buldging are the by-product of irregular sutural growth during prolonged oblique modifications (Tiesler 1999a:216-217, Table 6.6). 6. Six classes of burial contexts ("0" [lowest, no offering], to "5" [highest - more than six status indicators]) were dis tinguished according to the presence of thirteen different sta tus markers in primary interments. These include presence of tomb architecture, cinnabar, jadeite or obsidian specials, among others. Results of a general study of Maya biocultural attributes (Tiesler 1999a: 106) correlate 89.27 percent of the contexts with the "0" (direct interments without offerings) to "1" (direct interments with offerings but no status indicator) range and only 10.73 percent with scores of "2" and higher. The Preclassic assemblages showed scores that were similar to the Classic burials in the lower ranges. Most of the contexts scored as "2" or "3" and all "4" and "5" contexts are dated to the Classic period. 7. The skeletal collection has already been studied and the results published by Frank Saul in 1972. It was re-scored by the author recently for head shaping. The classification used by Saul (1972:107) only broadly distinguishes degree and type of cranial vault modification, while no information on the combined action of constricting bands in tabular erect shapes is provided. Burial 135, dated to the Xe Phase (900-600 B.C.), is reported in the original study by Saul (1972:10-13), who observes a slight lambdoid flattening. This specimen is not included in the present investigation since the skull was missing from the skeletal collection upon inspection by the author. 8. With the single exception of the specimen from Pampa</page><page sequence="22">Tiesler] HEAD SHAPES AMONG THE PRECLASSIC PERIOD MAYA AND CULTURAL MEANINGS 311 el Pajon, which was originally scored by Arturo Romano and which I re-coded for this investigation using the scholar's detailed metric and photographic record. 9. For the purposes of this study, I grouped the Preclassic period skull sample into three broad time periods: The Middle Preclassic period (900-300 B.C.), the Late Preclassic period (300 B.C.-A.D. 50), and Protoclassic period (A.D. 50-250), adhering broadly to the chronological ranges estab lished by the projects. In the case of overlap ?namely Dzibilchaltun's Xculul Phase (50 B.C.-A.D. 150), Altar's Plancha Phase (300 B.C.-A.D. 250) and Uaxactun's Chicanel Phase (300 B.C.-A.D. 250)? the counts were divided pro portionally. 10. Interestingly, there is no evidence of circular head constriction as sole shaping technique in the Maya skeletal record. Wraps appear to have been used always in combina tion with hard compression devices (Tiesler 1998:171-174, 1999a:209-211). For this reason, the constrictions are termed as "pseudo-circular." 11. This argument (i.e. for emulating the Maize God) could be made only for a part of the population during the Classic period, since most artificially produced vault forms during that era were neither strongly slanted nor conical in shape. As I have concluded in previous work (Tiesler 1999a:330), a discrepancy is perceivable between the unified aesthetics of head portraiture and the heterogeneous distribu tion of head forms in the skeletal record of the Classic period Maya. 12. The authors speak of a "sinuous cranium" (Saturno et al. 2005:31), denoting the top slant of the head's profile.
