<plain_text><page sequence="1">re: focus design Turning Architecture Inside Out: Revolving Doors and Other Threshold Devices Journal of Design History Vol. 22 No. 1 doi:10.1093/jdh/epn047 Laurent Stalder Architecture, in a historical deterministic perspective, can be viewed as a technological sys- tem that is expressed in "objective" parameters such as construction, material or functional operations. Correspondingly, the history of architecture can be understood as a history of its technological development, which is focusing on innovations. Yet, architecture is not only technology but also belongs to the field of commodities. Accordingly, the technological devel- opments not only lead to the change of the built environment but also to a change of their experience and their use. Biometric controls, motion detectors and different media of tele- communication such as the Intercom lead to an extension and change of the perception of the human environment. Nevertheless, the origin and the significance of these technological de- velopments can only be understood within a wider cultural context, as an expression of new, real or imagined needs, or as their representation. This article uses the architecture of the threshold as an example to examine these questions. The threshold separates the public and private sphere, private and common property and self-determined and over-directed action. As an architectural element or spatial configuration, it highlights historically specific, cultur- ally determined zones of transition, in which certain gestures and activities are performed. Keywords: architecture- design theory- human body- modernity- technology- threshold The architecture of the threshold, whether real or metaphorical, a structural compo- nent or a spatial structure, has always been an issue for architectural theory rooted in practice. Arnold van Gennep's anthropological studies of liminal situations (1907), Simmel's seminal essay, 'Bridges and Doors?, on constitutive cultural rites of sepa- ration and connection (1909), Benjamin's aphoristic notes on metaphorical and real, psychological and physical thresholds in his Parisian Passagen-Werk of the late 1930s, the work of Team X in the late 1950s on the spatial significance of doorsteps, Victor Turner's writings on social threshold situations and rites (1969) or Bruno Latour's observations on the socio-technological history of locking mechanisms (1992) attest to a preoccupation throughout the twentieth century with the threshold as a point of transition, even though, with few exceptions, these debates took place beyond the parameters of practice-based architectural theory.1 Given that technological developments have radically altered the face of architec- tural practice since the latter half of the nineteenth century, it seems expedient once again to take a closer look at this structural component and its architectural significance; for traditional threshold architectures such as doors, gates, portals and passages have been complemented over the last 150 years by a variety of ap- paratus, technical devices and infrastructural amenities, which serve to regulate the various streams and currents of people, traffic, liquids and so forth that perfo- rate the tectonic structures of architecture and circulate within them. Exemplary for this development is the history of the revolving door. Not only can its development be traced from the mid-nineteenth century to the present but its © The Author [2009].

Moreover, it epitomizes the fusion of architectural component and technical apparatus that has so decisively shaped the development and mechaniza- tion of architecture throughout the last 150 years. Architecture as 'machine á habiter' If one follows Sigfried Giedion's groundbreaking study from 1949, Mechanization Takes Command, comprehensive re-structuring of the environment- from the agricul- tural economy and food industry through to architecture, machines, apparatus and equipment- began in the mid-nineteenth century.2 This development is evident in vari- ous ventures to integrate individual dwellings or entire buildings in broadly networked urban infrastructures: warm air systems (as of 1840),3 water and sewerage systems (as of 1850), steam-powered heating (as of 1890)4 or machines to dehydrate, dry or cool the air (as of 1900).5 Circulation systems designed to convey and regulate traffic- the ele- vator successfully tested in 1853 and electrified in 1880, or the escalators and 'moving pavements' introduced in the 1890s- must also be seen as part of these strivings to control streams and currents, human and otherwise.6 Telephones, radio, TV, the Internet and other networks later came to redefine the traditional function of a private home as the locus of residence and sojourn, encounter and communication, and make of it an interface for actors and activities located beyond its physical parameters.7 Conversely, on the heels of every new type of opening or circulation system fol- lowed a device to control or lock it: security mechanisms such as Linus Yale Jr/s first industrially manufactured lock from 1865,8 the electric alarm system invented in the 1920s, the metal detectors introduced in airports in the 1970s, the puffer machines and body-scanners that followed at the end of the twentieth century or the Radio- frequency identification (RFID) systems installed in department stores;9 regulating devices such as the turnstile10 introduced for crowd management in British stadiums from 1871 and, by the end of the nineteenth century, also in Underground stations and at the entrance to swimming pools, fairgrounds and other leisure venues such as parks, piers, gardens and zoos, as well as for public toilets, ferry jetties and other terminals;11 or the revolving door patented in 188112 and installed well into the 1950s, primarily in much-frequented buildings such as public institutions, department stores, restaurants and hotels;13 communication devices such as the electromag- netic doorbell (1853) or two-way intercom (c.1920), which replaced, respectively, bell-pulls and door knockers,14 and air pressure and speaking tubes;15 and climatic barriers such as the air curtain or automatic sliding doors introduced in the 1950s. It is no coincidence that the 'engineer's definition of a dwelling'16 as a 'machine for living' arose in the mid-nineteenth century. Frenchman Adolphe Lance had coined the latter term as early as 1853 to describe an architecture that serves no longer merely as a place of refuge but also as an instrument that catalyses its users' activities. As Georges Teyssot has demonstrated, it is characterized by two genealogies that clashed some time around 1840: firstly, a sanitary one oriented to the 'exact quantification of fluidum' and, secondly, a technological one that strives both for maximal capacity use and 'complete programming' of rooms.17 In a wider sense, therefore, as Peter Sloterdijk has argued, 'living is made explicit' in the machine for living because 'existence as sojourn' is deployed 'architecturally, aesthetically, juridically' and so forth, with cor- responding effects on the spatial apprehension of architecture and its limits.18 The revolving door as a technical device In 1881 H. Bockhaker registered a patent in Berlin under the title 'Draught-free Door', emphasizing the inherent functional benefits of the first (two-winged) 7Q Turning Architecture Inside Out</page><page sequence="3">revolving door. Seven years later, in 1888, a mechanical engineer from Philadelphia, Theophilius Van Kannel, registered a US patent for his 'Storm Door Structure', which paved the way for the device's breakthrough.19 The purpose of the revolving door succinctly resumed in the Van Kannel Revolving Door Company's advertising slogan was to be 'Always open- Always closed'. Its properties- 'easy to operate, it works smoothly, it saves time'20 as a contemporary of Van Kannel claimed- quickly made it an indispensable door type. As an airtight barrier to the draughts caused by warmed air rising through elevator and ventilation shafts, it helped miti- gate the technical and, in particular, the climatic inadequacies of that recent inven- tion, the high rise. Insofar it was an important component of the complex machinery that, along with other inventions such as skeleton construction, fire protection and elevators, made this type of building at all technically feasible. From a teleological perspective, the development of the revolving door and its suc- cessors demonstrates a seemingly continuous refinement of the double demand, to be simultaneously open and closed. As early as 1912, the Van Kannel Company registered a patent for a 'power-assisted revolving door', driven by an electric mo- tor that obviated the use of sheer force to move what were, frequently, doors of solid timber and brass. In 1925, a further inventor put a door equipped with 'speed control' on the market. In 1944, a revolving door fitted with an 'electric eye' was introduced, which, thanks to an infra-red beam, would begin to turn 'as if by magic' and permit people to 'walk through without pushing or even lifting a finger'.21 In the course of the 1950s, the automatic sliding glass door, which offered roughly the same climatic advantages as the revolving door whilst also allowing users a completely no-touch entry, began to supplant its predecessor.22 A few years later the sliding door was succeeded in turn by the air curtain.23 Significantly, it was Van Kannel who, in 1904, shortly after the invention of the revolving door, had also registered a patent for 'Means for Excluding Drafts from Open Doorways', and formulated the underlying principles of the various devices that, some fifty years later, as a result of the continuous technical refinement and de-materialization of points of passage, were to replace tectonic thresholds- the revolving door, swing door, sliding door or turnstile24- and play a role as new instruments of segrega- tion: from the air curtain of the 1960s through to the electronic anti-theft devices so common today, such as Electronic Article Surveillance25 or the RFID26 systems in- troduced in the 1970s. Seen in this light, the chronological progression from the revolving door to the air curtain could actually be read as the continuous develop- ment of a 'single technical object', throughout the history of which its inherently contradictory roles- to be open and closed, permeable and forbidding- as well as its resistant aspects- its weight, materiality and redirection of traffic- have been repeatedly resolved in new coherent structures [1] [2] [3]. The revolving door as an object of daily practice Significantly, Van Kannel's revolving door was praised not only for its technical refinement but also for its moral benefits. 'It saves lives', asserted a journalist eu- logizing its inventor. Exactly how was explained some lines later: 'Every time a swinging door opens, those people [clerks, elevator operators and salespeople] are hit by a draft from the street, a draft that may bring with it another sniffle, an- other cold, another case of pneumonia'.27 This was a significant comment, per- fectly in keeping with European and American endeavours to improve standards of hygiene during the latter half of the nineteenth century and the first third of the twentieth- from discussions of the 'noxious effluvia' and 'baleful miasmas' that Victorian cities sought to vanquish,28 through to avant-garde architects' vociferous rallying cry of the 1930s: their demand for healthy apartments with air, light and warmth.29 It was no coincidence that, in addition to his metropolitan 'always Laurent Stalder 71</page><page sequence="4">Fig 1. Theophilus van Kannel, 'Draughtproof Three-Compart- ment Revolving Door', US Patent 387,571, 1881. (© Royal Boon Edam Group Holding B.V.). closed'-model, Van Kannel patented a revolving door for houses, the heavy wings of which could, conversely, be flung wide in 'always-open' mode to assure resi- dents the benefits of country air on warm spring or autumn days.30 In this respect the revolving door was not merely a machine that embodied the border between inside and out, warm and cold air, and even between the private and public spheres 72 Turning Architecture Inside Out</page><page sequence="5">Fig. 2 'Electric Eye' Revolving Door Control', Advertising T. Hagenbrook and International Steel Co., 1944. (© Royal Boon Edam Group Holding B.V.). or clean and dirty environments; it also became part of a system of cultural codes with quite contradictory requirements, which ran counter to the supposed linearity of technical progress.31 Similarly, the fact that sliding doors and warm air curtains supplanted revolving doors in the post-war period was not so much because of the latter's technical inadequacies as of the fundamental changes in shopping habits throughout the 1940s, with the de- velopment of self-service supermarkets32 and the simultaneous introduction of shop- ping carts,33 which together generated a range of influential innovations. Nonetheless, the desire to encourage greater consumption by installing the most permeable doors possible34 was thwarted when the oil crisis of the 1970s triggered public demands for more efficient and ecologically sound climatic controls, which helped reinstate the revolving door's previous success.35 Demands for increased security in banks, air- ports and other high-risk locations- particularly clamorous during debates on interna- tional terrorism in the 1970s, and even more so in the wake of 9/1 1 in 200136- also put revolving doors back on the agenda as a viable security solution. Certainly, requisite access control systems based on code input, portable chips or biometric procedures Laurent Stalder 73</page><page sequence="6">can be installed in any type of entrance. Yet the me- chanics and geometry of a revolving door serve bril- liantly as a high-security sluice in that they isolate each person- a prerequisite of effective control- without necessitating further extensive structural measures.37 Given that threshold architectures in this respect in- creasingly give centre stage to the performative as- pects of building (and of their users' disciplined bodies), they constitute not so much a structural el- ement as an apparatus, one that renders explicit the individual functions of a threshold and simultane- ously shapes the human body. As Bruno Latour has demonstrated in reference to the automated door closer, an apparatus is anthropomorphic, not sim- ply because it is man-made and facilitates or com- pletely replaces human action but because it shapes human action by regulating in a prescriptive man- ner how the user is to physically undertake an ac- tion.38 In effect therefore, the technical innovations associated with threshold architectures reflect the rationale of a progressively refined technological system as well as spanning the poles of requisite comforts and disciplinary strategies, which in turn influences people's use and perception of architecture. Thus, even the very first revolving doors, which enjoyed privileged status in anonymous metro- politan venues such as hotels, high-rise buildings or department stores, not only facilitated access but also served in the same measure to keep out the weak, as numerous accident reports confirm.39 Significantly, accident victims were frequently el- derly people or children: those who deviated from the typical body foreseen for this machine- the typified body of modern man.40 Indeed, whilst the introduction of light barriers or other technological measures for accident prevention or for isolating visitors in high-security buildings41 may be read as a progressive technical refinement of the revolving door, it nonethe- less marks a substantial turning point. Beyond maintaining the aforementioned tendency of the revolving door to distinguish between a threshold's various func- tions, the introduction of new devices gave rise to a differentiated and interactive experience of the threshold, one divided into moments of 'recognition', 'passage', 'cleansing' or 'absolution', etc. Technical devices in turn cause whatever was hitherto perceived as the uniform, idealized body of the user to now appear as individualized organs, each of which is required to cooperate on a specific task: a leg activates the light barrier's sensor, a body shell sets off metal detectors, an iris is scanned in the biometric control and so forth. The individuation of experi- ences made in passage across a border fragments the body, the wholeness of which consequently becomes palpable only by crossing through a variety of dis- tinct limits or borders; the body no longer knows inside and outside but only a continuous state of 'being in the middle', no longer knows any borders but only potential margins, no definite point of passage but only a continuous state of transition.42 Fig. 3.

(© Royal Boon Edam Group Holding B.V.). 74 Turning Architecture Inside Out</page><page sequence="7">The architecture of the threshold In more general terms, the increasing importance of technical apparatus and de- vices throughout the twentieth century opened up new prospects for a review of architectural practice. As Reyner Banham demonstrated in his research of the 'well-tempered environment' exemplified by the architecture of Le Corbusier, tech- nical developments gave rise not only to the potential resolution of the traditional, protective, isolating wall in single, independent functional components- the glazed wall to keep out the rain, the brise-soleil to keep out the sun, the mur neutralisant for the control of inside temperature, soundproofing against noise and so forth43- but equally, by differentiating visual, acoustic, climatic and other limits, to the po- tential resolution of the threshold as a physical, tectonic border in a series of continuous threshold spaces: from an individual boundary to a series of boundar- ies, from the border in its divisive function to a border area with a connective func- tion, from the threshold to threshold space.44 Significantly, the first revolving door patented by Van Kannel already marked not so much a boundary as a space of transition, one that was extended and enhanced throughout its history by various devices- air curtains, light barriers or surveil- lance systems- designed to improve hygiene, climatic control or security and which, ultimately, led to more specialized, distinct possibilities of spatial demarca- tion: visual and acoustic segregation by means of intercom systems, for example, employed at the latest by 1900 in Germany and France;45 thermal and, later, olfac- tory and hygienic segregation by means of the air curtain used in the 1950s in hospitals, airports and department stores; hygienic segregation by means of the disinfection sluice that transpired as a distinct room in hospitals around the end of the nineteenth century; or limitations for security purposes as imposed by the metal detector, which was first used in the 1970s in airports and, somewhat later, also in law-courts and government buildings. Thus, openings in the wall are more than simply a structural opening. Simultaneously a border and a crossing point, their prevailing characteristic is 'ambiguity'.46 They can render a wall impenetrable yet also connote a potential breakthrough; it is they that enable the border between interior and exterior space to be abrogated, and a limited, enclosed space to merge at any moment with universal infinity.47 The opening qualifies the crossing point. As a differentiating barrier, it permits or de- nies entry into or exit from a space and establishes in the course of its usage dis- tinct spaces for trade, consumption or residency. Openings not only permit transition but also establish narratives of exclusion or inclusion, control or com- fort, cleanliness or privacy, which become inscribed in the daily practice of their use and in turn also influence that use. Whilst doors represent a clear border between interior and exterior space, the dif- ferentiation of threshold architectures, which ensued from the use of devices and machines, led to their fragmentation, to a series of individual threshold elements, each with its own way of drawing borders.48 These various borders made explicit by various narratives thereby constitute spaces that are independent of one an- other, and confront the proverbial 'four walls' with a countless number of autono- mous functional spheres that are at times barely distinguishable from one another. The 'disseminated (and no longer uniform)', 'miniaturised (and no longer national)' and 'more polyvalent (and no longer specialized)' aspect of social practice that de Certeau identified in the final stages of the twentieth century, indeed appears to have found its material equivalent in the proliferation of these anonymous appara- tuses in the course of the twentieth century.49 At the threshold clash two different, opposing forces in contemporary architec- ture, the relationship of which was slowly reversed during the twentieth century. Laurent Stalder 75</page><page sequence="8">The emancipatory ideology of modernism, whose catchwords such as 'Liberated Living' or 'Un-private House' had demanded that the spatial limits of architecture be completely dissolved, finds itself now confronted with its opposite: an architec- tural practice that employs the endlessly multiplying series of apparatuses to re- organize and limit this all-too-open space, and thereby- subliminally- poses new challenges for established, discourse-oriented currents in contemporary architec- tural theory.
