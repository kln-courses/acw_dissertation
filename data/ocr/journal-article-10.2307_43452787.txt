<plain_text><page sequence="1">Debra Winger and Shirley MacLaine in Terms of Endearment. eWorld of Our Mothers by Marcia Pally Housewives are heroes, too. Trouble is, Terms of Endearment, the blockbuster with the mother/daughter hook, slips fleetly from appreciation to endorse- ment - and that's a whole other kettle of fish. Emma (Debra Winger) marries early, gets pregnant early (and often), and despite the detractions of a faculty- wife's lot (the tenure of poverty and of the hubby's post-puberty graduate stu- dents), she respects, likes, and believes in what she's been set on Earth to do. She'll raise those kids, by golly. She is not about to let her husband (Jeff Dan- iels) get away with that hanky panky. Thankfully, and cleverly, director James L. Brooks avoids the Pollyanna pitfall by allowing Emma a little loneliness, frus- tration, and even a warm, friendly affair of her own. And you're with her every step of the way. She may be dowdy, but she's real; she's okay. Her girlhood best friend Patsy (Lisa Hart Carroll) is not okay. Divorced and childless, she moves to New York to pursue a career, and hangs out with other professional women also divorced and childless (or worse, too busy to raise their children themselves; they hire help). And they have . . . how shall we say, social diseases. If you had any doubt that you're not only supposed to applaud and admire Emma's life but assume her choices as your own, a few scenes make the prescription patent. Emma visits New York and lunches with Patsy's buddies. Tailored to the hilt, they prattle about their abortions and shrinks, unsatisfying boyfriends and yeast infections, and after it all, Emma has her say. Standing in the wind outside the River Cafe and gesticulating like the prophet Isaiah, she delivers her what- the-hell-is-going-on-here sermon: What's the world coming to when women talk about their ovaries over lunch? These women are frivolous and spoiled, she says in essence (salt-of-the- earth Emma is her mom's daughter to be sure - and it is this link between her and Aurora Greenway, Shirley MacLaine, that forms the terms of endearment). Let me tell you what life's really about, Emma says: I am a mother of three and I have cancer. Cancer is this century's martyrdom. Replacing the cross, it sets halos atop its victims; as an update on consumption, it wrings your heart as you wring your handkerchief. The good woman, who sacrificed herself for her family all along, makes the final sacrifice. Left to clutter up the world instead are beautiful but bird-brained career women who've never grown up and accepted adult re- sponsibilities. The contrast screams: who will rear the next generation of chil- dren if you women are spending your afternoons at board meetings and your days off buying Ralph Lauren suits at Barney's; who will tuck the kids in at night if mothers expect to have sex lives, too? Now queries of this ilk would be legit if posed to fathers as well as to mothers, but even in Kramer vs Kramer and the host of paternity films that followed - Author ! Author !, Table for Five , Man , Woman , and Child , among others - no one expects fathers to stay home, "let themselves go," and give up sex. In fact, when Dad does stay home and starts "slipping" in Mr. Mom, we know he has to be rescued by gainful employment and an end to househusbandry. The dis- crepancy is as old as the hills: men get to have both a life outside the family and a life within it; women, if they're lucky, get to choose between them, but usually the choice is not theirs to make. When settle-for-less messages are on the agenda, it's always best to have a woman send the word to her sisters. In a later scene, Patsy - Uncle Toming with- out shame - looks bedridden Emma in the eye and confides, "You've been my anchor." The New Woman salutes the "little woman" and tells the audience just who has been keeping civilization in place. Such is Brooks' retort (along with nov- elist Larry McMurtry's) to a world where traditional roles are becoming unhinged. You see, girls, Emma's got the solution; while not paradise, it's our best alterna- tive. It has the lure of familiarity (our mothers did it) and apparent simplicity (get married and rest will take care of itself). But does it have any bearing on life? Women are indeed grappling with these issues, juggling career, love, sex, and children, and we scrutinize - some- times much to our liberated surprise - not only innovative variations on house and child care but the time-worn divi- sion of the sexes. Most often, when faced with these imponderables, we look at our mothers. What hurt them, what damaged their potential; what did they have that we need; what did they have that we're losing? Some of us go back, unearthing our mothers' early years, the time when we were too young to understand, or when we were not yet born. It is an act of 11</page><page sequence="2">Vibeke Lokkeberg and Nina Knapskog clown together for one moment in Kamilla. conjuring, of imagination, but also of identifying with them. It is what Gloria Steinem does in her story "Ruth's Song (Because She Could Not Sing It)." It is what Diane Kurys does in her film Entre Nous , recreating her parents' experi- ences of the Forties and Fifties. And in Malou , Jeanine Meerapfel develops both a stand-in for her present-day self, searching for her mother, and, in the character of Malou, the person her mother was two generations ago. Others of us begin from our own childhoods, remembering our parents as we saw them then, and figuring from our experiences what theirs must have been. This is more an act of projection than invention, and it is Vibeke Lokke- berg's project in Kamilla. The complex- ity of the investigation should make Brooks blush. • Kamilla represents the disintegration of a marriage from the worm's eye per- spective of the ... eponymous seven-year- old ... - J. Hoberman, The Village Voice. Written and directed with tenderness .. .the child's performance is superb. - Los Angeles Times. A child s-eye view of disrupted mar- riage . . . - San Francisco Chronicle. Iťs a child's story, they say, a view of the world from a girl's perspective, nei- ther cloying nor (the newer tendency in cinema) all sass and savvy. And without a doubt, this is one of Kamilla' s fortes. The seven-year-old Kamilla (Nina Knapskog) sits on the too-big toilet, legs dangling, straining, asking mommy to hold her hand and God "to make the hole bigger." And the camera crawls, with the girl, under her father's shop assistant's chair, as the adults sit and chatter away, to see just what is between the lady's thighs. She looks up at where the tops of stockings give way to flesh and garters; she sniffs there too - maybe it smells different. It does smell differ- ent. The gesture tells us all about Kamilla: just old enough to know she'll catch hell if found but not old enough for the pro- hibition to make any kind of sense. The voice of authority and the sway of con- vention - to her arbitrary and whimsical - can't quite override the simple lure of inquisitiveness. When Kamilla is discov- ered, Mom angrily yanks her away, ap- palled not only by the breach of conduct but at the invasion of private places, of the taboo, never stopping to recognize the ingenuousness, the artlessness, of her child's curiosity. Kamilla's problem is that nobody really stops to think about her. Fed, clothed, housed, given what toys her working class parents in poor postwar Norway can manage, she's not abused or neglected. It's just that her parents seem to be missing the point. They love her, but it's a love that they - especially the father - keep putting on automatic pi- lot. Lokkeberg: "People assume that they have to work on a marriage but that love for their children is always there, that they don't have to do anything about it." In short, Kamilla is not loved enough. Svein (Kenneth Johansen), the little boy from across the street, isn't loved enough either. It's the same story: the mother cares, but somehow her affec- tion doesn't often reach the kid. So Kamilla and Svein roam around town together, watching her father take up with his blond, hip-wiggling assistant and move with her into the shop down- stairs, leaving Kamilla and her mother to fend for themselves upstairs. Svein's fa- ther packs up and leaves altogether. Eventually, Svein is packed up too, the welfare department deeming the or- phanage a better home than his maternal one. As her only friend is whisked out of her life, Kamilla stands there, nose run- ning, sobs shaking her body, making her throat and eyes raw; she is crying from the bottom of her heart. Lokkeberg: "In Kamilla , you should feel what it was like when you were a child." And you do. In this passage, whatever introduced you to loss - a pet hit by a car, a best friend moving away - comes rushing back. The emotion here is only partly for Kamilla's grief, the rest is regret of your own. So the child's-eye view is vividly present, but with it Lokkeberg pushes through to the adults. Lokkeberg was a child in postwar Norway, and extrapolat- ing from memory, she supposes the situ- ation of that generation of parents. In turn, her hunches about their problems and solutions, about their children's im- pressions and interpretations, explain bits of the woman this war-baby girl grew up to be. Kamilla' s adults aren't getting enough love either - not a single one of them - and their groping for some of their own creates Kamilla's lack. Occupied by their hunger, they fail to notice when she has nothing to eat. And love spread too thin is but one of these decent folks' problems. Money, time, space, play are all in tight supply; even the ostensible sexual passion between father and shop- girl seems more a stumbling, half- hearted grasping at any chance for change or excitement than a deep-run- ning emotion. Though Kamilla is not without its hu- mor (it is much more a slice of the downs and ups of life than unrelenting, bleak grit), in the main, everyone's on the hunt for love: the father and his fling; Svein's mother and Kamilla's mother - two abandoned wives - drink and flirt with a traveling lingerie salesman, so lonely are they; the shopgirl flirts with American sailors who pass through town but settles for said lingerie salesman, leaving Father to see if he can convince Mother to take him in again. And every- one's on the make for money: the pile of cash Father has stashed away takes on almost anthropomorphic proportions as the bundle is filched by Mother and its possession becomes the substance of the parents' relationship. But not everyone has the same resources. Kamilla has the worst of it, as children often do. With barely any way to articu- late her needs and no power to satisfy them, she's stuck making the best of what comes her way, rebelling when she can't take it any longer - and even these 12</page><page sequence="3">Lokkeberg : ' It helps that I have children but I could' ve made this film without being a mother.' outbursts are futile. Kamillus mother, and Svein's mother, for that matter, don't have it much better. Having lost her husband, Svein's mom tries to earn a few pennies by delivering newspapers - and then loses her kids too. Kamilla's mom, stunned by her husband's affair, can think only to hide the money, to stretch it as long as possible. Kids, for better or for worse, generally must ac- cept fate's dealings; what's astonishing here is the women's immobility, their acquiescence. While children usually see their parents as omnipotent, Kamilla - and in a sense, Lokkeberg - knows her mother has no place to go. "This is a red line through my films, giving up in front of oppression because you don't know how - or you can't - push anymore," says Lokkeberg. And the exhausted ones are always women. In The Revelation (1976), Lokkeberg's first feature-length film, an unattractive middle-aged housewife cannot protect herself from the demeaning humiliation that eventually kills her. In Abortion (1970), a television documentary, a young working-class girl cannot con- vince the authorities to grant her the operation because she can't make them understand how pressing are her circum- stances. A variation on "they don't feel pain like we do," their disregard renders her not quite human, not like "us." Middle-class women have an edge here, but only because they have the tools - speech, dress - to wheel and deal with the medical establishment. In Lokke- berg's TV series on paternity suits (the mean and niggardly kind where unmar- ried mothers are forced into court to claim money from their children's fa- thers, not the rosy Kramer vs. Kramer kind where feminist fathers fight for cus- tody), a young woman is so undermined by questions Stateside cops and judges usually reserve for rape victims that she, like Lokkeberg's other heroines, throws in the towel: okay, don't pay; I'll man- age myself. And Lokkeberg's upcoming project, still in the script stage, is about a nineteenth-century woman boxed in by her milieu. Without being didactic, these films expose the pathos, the injustice, of lives worn down and out. Kamilla , for exam- ple, retains too much of life's damnable complexities to be schematic - an achievement doubly remarkable for Lokkeberg's having written and di- rected the film, and played the role of Kamilla's mother. (Unfortunately, KamilkCs American distributor excised several passages which lend dimension and nuance to the characters. The men suffer the most. In the complete ver- sion, Svein's father, for example, is a lout, but also a socialist, a man capable of empathy, and deeply concerned with workers' right to strike. In a poignant scene, he begs the folks taking their sun at a seaside park to refrain from buying bananas picked by scab labor. In the cut version, he's a lout plain and simple.) But Lokkeberg's films are not only exposés of injury and wrongdoing; they do not, in high dudgeon, simply point the finger at "the enemy." Rather, they point up how women figure in to their own attrition. It is not a matter of being complicit - they lack the necessary choice - but of running out of steam. • Eleven or so years ago, Vibeke Lokkeberg married Terje Kristiansen. He runs a cinema and has since served as coauthor and producer of a number of her works, and is now beginning his first directorial project. Theirs is a romantic tale: Lokkeberg saw his picture in the paper and recalls, "I knew I could have something with a man with a face like that, alive like that. I brought him my abortion film and asked him to show it." He was married with two children; they hit it off. "When I told her I was divorc- ing my wife, she looked at me as if to say, so?" Lokkeberg: "He expected me to jump up with, 'Oh, let's get married.' I said I didn't know; maybe it would last two weeks. I think he's still afraid I'll tell him the two weeks are up." He: "Of course." Nobody believes it. They enjoy telling the story, allowing them - as it does - to be dashing and daring and slightly risqué together (re- membering the early love) but also to flirt with roles no longer theirs. She plays a combination of old-fashioned hard-to- get and new-fashioned woman, suspi- cious of tradition and long-term ties (in either case, a woman with the power to reject; a woman who must be carefully won). He plays liberal nice guy for whom these liberated gals are too much - and of course, she sets all the terms. "When I asked her to marry me she said, 4If you ever interfere with my work, it's out with you.' So I understood how it was going to be from the start." And they know nobody believes it. Feminism has succeeded in becom- ing a standard by which we judge our "liberation," but those who foot-drag sometimes know they pull the wool over no one's eyes. Kristiansen, after taking the baby away for a while (they have two daughters) so that Lokkeberg and I could talk, returned, saying self-mock- ingly, "What do you mean you're giving my wife a hard time about me - and I just took the baby for an hour so you'd see what a wonderful husband I am. It's my one effort of the year. . . " So Lokkeberg is married, has two kids, writes, acts, and directs, and is by no means running out of steam. She has support. "Terje has always helped me. He's helped with money for my films, and you can't imagine what it means to have a creative producer. He would even have preferred that he end up in the 'female' role rather than me . . . "It's important to me to have these relationships, to be close with these three people. If I were offered a role where I had to be away for ten weeks, I wouldn't take it; I wouldn't be away. It's Terje who built the editing equipment in the garden house so I could continue my work. And Terje regrets his time away from the children." His hand comes down on the table, then points at his sucking baby: "I don't have that breast." Then, more softly, "My film is about alienation, about alienation from my children." Yes, but. His regret, like his support, is deep and heartfelt, but there is a point beyond which it does not spur him. Men can hold their babies. It is not the same as nursing; it is equivalent, much of the benefit of breast-feeding - as countless monkey studies tell us - coming from the cradling, the fondling. Men can bot- tle-feed, whenever that's appropriate, and men can simply spend time. At a certain point, regret is gratuitous. The arguments between them are the contests of a generation: he assumes I'll be home in the evening so he can work, he wrote me two pages of reasons why he has a right to that time while I was feeling like a housewife, at home with the children till he came home at 10 or 13</page><page sequence="4">Isabelle Huppert and Guy Marchand in Entre Nous. 11, full of his work, wanting to talk about it; when he's in conversation, he doesn't hear the baby crying, he goes on talking - he doesn't hear her; he forgets to feed them if he's not hungry, not imagining they might be hungry if he's not, he doesn't make the identification with them; he can work all day at the cinema, then work all night on his film without even coming in for dinner. But: his hours at the cinema aren't adjustable and "we rely on that salary. I can work at home." "Can." She has arranged to be able to work in her garden house (eliminating the apparent necessity of going to the editing room at the studio); they thought of a way for her to do it, they spent time and money realizing that so- lution. For her. Not for him. In the ab- sence of a flextime utopia, one dances around the usual way of doing things, improvising new steps - but the rake of the stage is uphill all the way. In the absence of a lot of steam, men also give out. "I accept that this is how it is; he isn't as connected to the children. But I don't want to make a mother out of him. He's a man. In Norway we have the 'soft- man,' the man who threw aside his ca- reer and became a househusband. He's soft; he can cry. I don't want that. It doesn't work." There are reasons legiti- mate and suspect. Unrelenting domes- ticity is apparently just as boring for men as it is for women; men resented it. But also: "It goes against their cultural train- ing; they lost the sense of themselves as men. They had become softer because that's what they thought women wanted, but it turned out that women still wanted Men, sturdy, with hair on their chests." It runs against their cultural upbring- ings; they give out. Returning to the breadwinner role runs with it. And while maintaining a career doesn't discomfort most women, separation from the chil- dren, allowing someone also to care for them, to spend more time with them than they themselves do (even the fa- ther) - these chafe. These run against our earliest-learned lessons; "alterna- tive" work conditions assuage the abra- sion. She can work at home; her sense of self is not eroded, rather the picture of herself, formed in girlhood, acquires a few more strokes. When it comes to motherhood and domesticity, women have all the fuel they need. To continue to invent new household arrangements, upturning mistakes, sift- ing through the irritants and anodynes, adding a newt's eye here, a toad's leg there, and trying the brew again, re- quires tenacity, not to mention concen- tration, dedication, psychological matu- rity, flexibility, creativity, a logical mind with a firm grip over the emotions and, God knows, it's hard to be perfect when one has so many other things to do in the day. So, there is acquiescence in Lokke- berg's life, not only to his "cultural train- ing" (they argue, but they enliven each other more than harm or restrain), but to her own. It is the resignation of Kamilla's mother one generation later, with all the mutations of a feminist evolution. She is familiar with it, with fighting it, with accepting. . . even appreciating it, and it is a force in her films. "I had to repeat the family. . . I have to be with a man like my father; he forms my very idea of what a man is If I would not go into these relations, my life would be skimming on the surface. It's like an apple on a tree: first it's green, then ripe, then it becomes rotten and falls. I have a friend, a director, who's 44 and looks at the world like a girl - and I can see it in her films. She's never been married, no children, and she makes appointments with men all for a good time. A green apple." One of Kamilla' s strengths is the de- velopment of its characters (including its two children, from whom Lokkeberg elicited performances all the more effec- tive for their subtlety). Some piece1 of an elusive, winding temperament is learned about them with each of their scenes. But Lokkeberg hardlý bore two daughters just to improve on her scriptwriting. ("It helps that I have chil- dren but I could've made this film with- out being a mother. I have a way of dealing with children.") Her need for them is as passionate and inexplicable as the need - in those who have it - for men with hair on their chests. • The thrust of passion admits little dis- pute; what feels right, clicks, sits well, usually has our way with us. And, adding imprimatur to impulse, society encour- ages women about their intuition, a "sense of things" supposedly being our talent. It is how mom - and now femi- nism (giving value to the womanly senti- ment or action) - told us to get along. It's just that it may not get us where we want to go. The stuff of "gut reactions" - the men and women our fathers and mothers were, our germinative expecta- tions, first distinctions - is generated by circumstances not all of which we want to repeat; merely "feeling" our way may bear false witness, leading us back to where Mom was miserable, to acquies- cence. But also, with confounding irony, to where the green becomes ripe. Part of knowing the difference, of knowing when we grow and when we comply, is the blind business of judging why something feels "right." Is it the comfort of familiarity; the ease of con- vention; the pleasure of that unbeatable boost, the mix of familial joy, pride, and encouragement, that tells you you're 14</page><page sequence="5">Kurys: ' Several of the backers wanted an explicit lesbian scene - it's one of their main fantasies. But I don' t want to please them . I thought: stay hungry. ' tops? Is it what you want? We are ensnared in an odd conun- drum, our knee-jerk reactions contain- ing a fifth column. "I don't know that I am not doing things that oppress me. I don't know that." We cannot do without them (and men generally need to attend to them more than they do) but we can- not quite observe them simply, uncriti- cally. Individually, gut reactions will prove undependable, unpredictably in- sightful and misleading; to rely on them as a whole, as information about our- selves or as a criterion for our decisions, may be atavistic - a throwback to a time of less change, when a woman's life more resembled those who came before her, those who helped seed her assump- tions in the first place. In fact, to a time when a woman's life was more like her mother's. It is to grapple better with those gut reactions that women exhume their mothers' pasts. • Diane Kurys, filmmaker, age 35, direc- tor of Entre Nous. Jeanine Meerapfel , filmmaker, age 40, director of Malou. Gloria Steinem , writer, editor, speaker, age 49, author of" Ruth's Song (Because She Could Not Sing It)." They want to know: what was my mother like at my age? "We had lunch on my birthday; I was 32. She was talk- ing about my childhood when I asked how old she was when she left my fa- ther. She stopped: łI was exactly your age.' She did all that- had two kids, moved out, took us to Paris, started a business by the time she was ..." The story became Entre Nous. Old enough now so that when we remember our mothers it is women of our age who come to mind, we try to see them as they were, again. We stare down the images in our heads, squint with the effort to bring them into focus, wonder what it was like for the woman in the photograph. We pursue them, and it is a greedy hunt: what can they tell us about us ? Why am I like this? Can you explain this crotchet or that, why I prefer this kind of man, that woman? Is this the way a grownup's life is supposed to feel? Can you tell me how to do it? Steinem: I know I will spend the next years figuring out what her life has left me. Meerapfel: It's not her real mother, not the real Malou, my protagonist has to find, but what she inherited from her. Hannah has Malou's fantasies: the vi- sion of Prince Charming, of protection, of setting the focus of her life in some- one else. Kurys: She did all that then, now I'm in the middle of my life. Am I on the right track? We expect some reflection from their lives to illuminate our confusion, but what is the difficulty we complain of; why don't we know ourselves better? With feminism, we have been re- charting our course, and now, standing in new country, with a chasm between us and "back home," we're only just discerning the nature of the break in the ground beneath. How do you walk for- ward in this place? The older, wiser women are not in front of us; most are behind on the other side, eking nourish- ment from ever less generous soil, and every time we go back and cross the gulf (if only in our imaginations) for means and answers, we understand a little of what we came to learn and much more of the gap that separates them from us. We learn, over and over, and each time more deeply, the character of the fault. Certain questions we bear are predict- able. There is, for instance, "How to Succeed in Business Without Really Crying." Steinem returned from India in the Sixties and discovered no one thought a "girl" could cover a foreign beat; try the style section, dear. She worked her way up. There are the mat- ters of proportion: career and home life, work and lovers, work and lovers and children and female friends, and books and time by oneself. Kurys's heroines, her mother and her mother's best friend - two housewives suffocating in the hothouse of Fifties provincial life - left their husbands and started a business together. A decade before Steinem, they also worked they way up. Tougher is the matter of impulse: not just his assumption that you'll make the bed when you're done making love, but catching your own hands as they pick up the pillows and straighten the sheets. Deeper still is the desire for nearness pitted against the fear of giving away too much of oneself. Meerapfel's Hannah ricochets between willfulness and de- pendence, engagement and work she doesn't take seriously, and as for the man she lives with, she wants him to coddle her like a girl-child and to have nothing whatsoever to say about her life. The impulses are eclectic, erratic, and we - like Lokkeberg - wonder how much of each we want. Work and home life, willfulness and dependence - how does one arrange it (without a full-time wife of one's own)? And more, what is the effort doing to us? Meerapfel's next film: the daughter of a "guest worker" (the German appela- tion for foreign labor), trying doubly hard to succeed (overcoming the handi- caps of gender and race), falls in love with a man bailing out of the "system." He is busy being un-busy, finding, fin- gering, getting the feel of the emotions he learned to ignore; she is being effi- cient. Meerapfel: "We are becoming hard, picking up the worst from men in order to make it in their world, shutting out so much, and soon we can have a man only for an evening, a weekend. We have our affairs like one more business lunch; we lose a sensitivity to our- selves." It is the green apple, and the risk it poses must be figured into the proportion. What about long affairs; does that al- low for both, the business and the self? "I like to live with lovers, to share the little things, breakfast...," says Meerapfel. And do you manage both? - Wolf is democratic - do you have chil- dren? - no - do you want to? - no; we are losing something, no? It's a question that can be asked only now, after something has been gained. But there's no going back. What we learn whenever we try, if only in our imaginations, is our need to work. The core of identity is spun from production; linking our needs to the requirements of the effort, we satisfy ourselves as we satisfy it; we make ourselves - as we make it - sui generis. It's not enough to accept someone else's project or to while away one's hours on a too-small plan. Steinem: "When Ruth told me stories of her past I used to say, 'But why didn't you leave? Why didn't you take the job? 15</page><page sequence="6">A bridge between past and present, Ingrid Caven and Grischa H uber in Malou. Why didn't you marry the other man?' She would always insist it didn't matter. ... If I pressed hard enough, she would add, 4If I'd left, you never would've been born.' I always thought but never had the courage to say: But you might have been born instead ." This is the gulf between our mothers and ourselves: the enormous fact of work. We come to them with questions of balance and they didn't have the same weights. They may open up, expose the conditions of their lives and the lessons they bequeathed to us, tacitly, both with and without volition (it is a treachery to our benefit). And the legacy is not frivo- lous: it is our cushion against becoming hard. But they can't tell us how to man- age both. • Kurys's mother worked. From the time Lena was in her early thirties, when she and Madeleine left their re- spective husbands, she supported her- self and two children, and was sup- ported by that intimate, sensual (but as far as Kurys knows, not actually sexual) friendship. "I have their letters... 4 1 love you; I caress you.' They were pas- sionate; it was for life." And there were men as well - Lena's and Madeleine's version of doing it all. "It's hard to ex- plain that they were still looking for a kind of Mr. Right. But they got the strength to leave their husbands, to go to Paris, from each other. That's my inher- itance, what my mother gave me. The energy, the independence of my life comes from her. She never counted on anyone." Lena's is a bequest that suggests a way to balance. Perhaps more improvi- satory, less articulated than the daugh- ter's life, certainly riskier - but still. And as the deeds of the fathers are visited on the sons, Lena's legacy returns in Kurys. Like Steinem and Meerapfel, she goes back to unearth her deceased mother's experience, but she travels with less self-doubt. She expects to find the gen- esis of her strength; they, their contra- dictions. When Steinem talks, her years of public speaking are evident: she is cogent, relaxed, never tentative. She is exciting. But in the quiet of writing Ruth's Song she must've groped: why did it take me so long? And Meerapfel's hes- itations, pauses at corners she can't see beyond, are patent: "We are losing something, no?" Kurys: "Directing is very feminine: the actors try to please you." I heard the assumption louder than the words: it is the privilege of women to be pleased, the obligation of others to do the pleas- ing. "I play the seductress on the set. But I am also the authority, and they have to try to seduce me. It's ambig- uous; I like it." And she likes the sexual ambiguity of her film (I can't help think- ing: because it leaves her in control). With all those passionate intimacies, did Lena and Madeleine ever make love? "Several of the backers wanted an ex- plicit lesbian scene - it's one of their main fantasies. But I didn't want to please them. I thought: stay hungry." What confidence in her prerogatives, and she is cool and certain facing sex and power, while other women still fum- ble. We feel, if only fleetingly, a mo- ment of alarm in each sexual encounter. Even if we are choosing, maneuvering, picking a man up, the caveat echoes internally: you are about to lose control; you are about to become his victim. It is our mothers' estate and because we find it in ourselves, we go back. But look at this difference. Kurys gives Mad- eleine and Lena each a scene of sexual pleasure, pure and simple: Madeleine with a teacher from her art school days, Lena on a train with an unknown soldier - Erica Jong's zipless fuck. She can imagine this, allow it, even to house- wives of the previous generation. Han- nah, a woman of Meerapfels' genera- tion, flicks ashes onto the lap of a man who's approached her in a bar. She has learned to be contemptuous while pro- tecting herself, but she cannot take him, though he is handsome and she is lonely, masturbating at night in the absence of her lover. She is defensive, even prissy (how dare vou!) in a modern sort of way; she is not confidently, cavalierly full of herself. Later, in a particularly self-de- structive mood, Hannah gets blotto and allows herself to be taken advantage of by a somewhat seedy fellow in a defi- nitely seedy hotel. Her desire has little of the legitimacy, her sex, little of the ease, of Lena's, Madeleine's - or Kurys's. Pleasure, pure and simple, eludes her; it is stifled by the maternal creed: sex sullies us, it is the act by which women become contemptible (unless he loves you, in which case it's grand but still double-edged). Kurys's life is not uncomplicated or easy, and she is obviously reflective. But introspection is not doubt . She comes into the arena with self-possession. "There are so few woman directors in the U.S. - in the avant-garde maybe, but few who try to make it commer- cially. I think they don't dare. They think it'll come from the sky or that it's impossible, that they'll never make it. The main difficulty, of course, comes from the men in charge, but some of it comes from the women. They don't dare . . . And at times, it's even easier for a woman to direct, easier to get the money or an extra hour of shooting time. We must have the honesty to say it." 16</page><page sequence="7">Meerapfel: 'We are becoming hard , picking up the worst from men in order to make it in their world. . It's a bit more overt than would be comfortable for most of us: manipula- tion, especially sexual manipulation, isn't nice. Kurys assumes not her suc- cess but her right to get in there and fight, and her presumption shocks (a shocked Meerapfel says: we are becom- ing hard). But how do we know when we are losing something and when we are being, naively, our own worst ene- mies? When are we being obedient to a code of our mothers', meant only to keep them in their place? How do we know when we acquiesce? Steinem: "I will spend the next years figuring out what her life left me." How will we know when to ignore what they left? And from Lokkeberg: "I must re- peat the family." How will we know when to betray it, knowing it brings false evidence? It is a question asked no less by children of immigrants than by this generation of women - by all those who walked, or ran, off the map of their par- ents' world. No wonder it's these art- ists - female and Jewish - who find these questions inescapable, who found their work on them. • Diane Kurys , age 35, Jewish , daughter of Russian emigrants to France , Holo- caust survivors . Jeanine Meerapfel , age 40 , Jewish , daughter of German emigrants to Argen- tina , Holocaust survivors. Gloria Steinem , age 49, half-Jewish, daughter of a " mixed * marriage accepta- ble to neither side and ending in poverty , emotional collapse, and separation. For the children of survivors, of the deracinated and the liminal, the fight to make it is desperate, the bottom line being not just poverty but a blind knock- ing about, an eternal trek, the Wander- ing Jew. Kurys: "Our ambitiousness is a kind of revenge," but also a kind of protection against ever becoming the victims our parents were. But in making it in the new world, we remake our- selves in its image, and after we've se- cured at least a little, we are faced with the possibility that something has slipped our grip. Empathy, perhaps. It is Meerapfel's "hard" businesswoman and Lokkeberg's unripened friend, it is the Jew keeping blacks out of the neighbor- hood; it is the Israelis on the West Bank. Daughters of Jewish immigrants (such useful foils) can't afford not to make it. We can't afford to maneuver ingenuously, to doubt our desert, to feel guilty about reward. And surely, some- thing of the traditional woman and tradi- tional Jew will be discarded. It would be a relief if the assumption of victimization were replaced by integrity - if only we could quiet the fears our Jewish mothers bequeathed to us without stifling the rest of the bequest, without sending our tradition of ethics to the winds, without confusing independence with denial. What of love and sex and children of our own? We are back to the matters of pro- portion, to the balancing act. Meerapfel lives in West Berlin - an address tom through by more than con- tradiction, by trauma, fury, pain - be- cause, at 19, she wanted to get out of her parents' house and in the Argentina of the Sixties, young ladies simply did not live alone; the scholarship to study abroad was first for Geneva, then Ger- many. She stayed "because of friends, jobs; I had a life there." "Do you have Jewish lovers?" Her shoulders sink a little. How to say, "I am not attracted to Jewish men"? It is the absence of mystery; the impossibility of seduction which enigma allows. Famil- iarity, even with the boons of sympathy and understanding, rushes by the deli- cate process; how can one slowly slip off some cover, dangle and let it drop? It is the absence of sex. "Jewish men are like cousins." Another conversation. An Argentin- ian man: "For South American women, I am like a father, a brother. They saw 'me' in my underwear. They know me immediately. There is no lure, no al- lure." But a man of European Jewish descent speaks passionately, confesses the desire for merger. It is the thrill, beyond recognition or empathy, of iden- tity - not only of never having to ex- plain, but of the abandon, the mael- strom, into which lovers will pull each other when everything has already been said, when what must be known can be assumed. To whom but a Jewish friend could I say, suddenly, out of context in a bustling bar, amid talk of career, of "par- laying" this gig into that, "Are you afraid of becoming a Jew again?" We move through publishing and journalism as bright young people; a yellow star would wipe out that life - our lives - in an in- stant. It is the shiver, a biting anticipa- tion, of where two people can go when they start at the end of the rope. For Meerapfel, it is too much. "I don't always want to know; I don't want him always to know." The reticence is her integrity, allowing her, in the face of routine and domesticity, to preserve the boundaries of her person. With merger, she would lose not only sex but self. This is the integrity necessary for the balance. • Our mothers lived with the men they loved, and then with the men they grew tired of, took for granted. There was hardly any choice. Bereft of alternative, they weathered conditions over which they had no control. They were molded by them, the weight of familiarity (too accessible to husband and children, too few protections against incursion) col- lapsing much of the self-possession. The mold is now in us, informing our impulses, and because of this, we go back. Lokkeberg went back to herself as a little girl and remembered her mother, if not actually assenting to a meager lot, then abstaining from more vigorous arenas. Steinem and Meerapfel under- took the trek, trying to slip into Mom's shoes, and they came upon similar sights: women on the side of the road, run out of steam. Only Kurys's mother was able to kick up some dust - but she had Madeleine. It is an irresistible trip, to learn about our legacy of temperament and psyche, but it is also narcissistic and romantic. And finite: we inevitably identify what can't be found there - the balance it- self, and the balance without guilt for our treachery, for taking what our mothers offered and discarding what does not suit us in order to keep our- selves from becoming them. In the end, we must figure all this, and run our lives without either the in- vented images of our mothers as young women or the hazy memories of our girl- hood perceptions. Will and efficacy, fear of nearness and of giving away too much, are ours to weigh. Our gut reac- tions are ours to consider, the acquies- cence ours to discern. The pity of it all is that a fifth column throws even wise and sustaining choices into doubt. ® 17</page></plain_text>
