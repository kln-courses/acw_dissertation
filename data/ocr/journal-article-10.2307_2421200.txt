<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CARNIVOROUS PLANTS. By Francis Ernest Lloyd. Vol. IX of a New Series of Plant Science Books, edited by Frans Verdoorn. Chronica Botanica Co., Waltham, Mass. 1942. xv + 352 pp., frontispiece, 38 pls., 11 figs. $6.00. Ever since their discovery the study of the carnivorous plants has captivated botanists. Information concerning these extraordinary plants stems frequently from folklore but includes now detailed biochemical studies on the utilization and importance of animal prey. The mechanisms evolved for this purpose by the many carnivorous plants belonging to widely separated taxonomic groups differ greatly in their efficiency and design. These extremely specialized structures, their component tissues, operation and functions are reviewed on the basis of available accounts and constantly supplemented and appraised in the light of the author's significant observations. For example, Darwin regarded Dionaea as the "most wonderful plant in the world," whereas Lloyd is of the opinion that "the evidence seems to favor Utricularia." The book then offers the reader a critical summary of our scattered knowledge of these plants as well as a wealth of valu- able new information. The author's delightful style does full justice to the fascinating story of the carniv- orous plants and betrays readily his wide personal acquaintance with them. But, regard- less of how tempting comparisons with man-made gadgets and anthropomorphic interpreta- tions might have been-a real "pitfall" to many less critical observers-the author wisely refrained from making such efforts by confining his comments to some obvious analogies and by not offering any "explanation" of the origin and evolution of carniyorous plants.--THEO.
