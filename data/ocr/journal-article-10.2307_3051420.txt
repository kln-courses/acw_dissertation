<plain_text><page sequence="1">Beyond the Grave: The Twentieth-Century Afterlife of West Mexican Burial Effigies Judy Sund In the 1890s, Norwegian anthropologist Carl Lumholtz set out to explore the Sierra Madre Occidental, a mountain chain that runs from Arizona to central Mexico. A committed practitioner of what James Clifford calls "salvage ethnogra- phy," Lumholtz was alarmed by the growing global scarcity of truly "primitive people" and intent on recording vanishing ways of life before they disappeared altogether.' In 1892 he set his sights on a region of the world so little visited by outsiders that he titled the two-volume chronicle of his journey Un- known Mexico.2 Published by Scribner's in 1902, it details Lumholtz's encounters with the Tarahumara, Tepehuan, Huichol, and Cora and draws attention to an unanticipated by-product of the expedition: his "rescue for science" of a historic primitive, in the form of a group of Pre-Columbian burial effigies (Fig. 1). Made between 200 B.C.E. and 400 C.E. for inclusion in elite burials in shaft tombs, the ancient figural sculptures de- scribed in Unknown Mexico had been gathered by locals after accidental unearthings and amateur excavations.3 As Lum- holtz traveled, he was invited to visit regional troves, and he eventually acquired several examples of the distinctive .ce- ramic production he called Tarascan-a misleading label that stuck for decades.4 In fact, the grave goods he collected were made by a constellation of cultures that predated the Ta- rascan kingdom by a millennium; today, they are broadly designated West Mexican. That label encompasses three cultures named for the modern states they once inhabited-- Nayarit, Jalisco, and Colima-which in turn incorporate distinctive subcultures.5 Living on the northwestern fringes of ancient Mesoamerica (those portions of modern Mexico and northern Central America that shared a common culture in the three thousand years prior to Spanish assault on the Americas), the peoples called West Mexican produced no writings, pyramids, or monumental stone sculpture, but they built and stocked hundreds of shaft tombs.6 From the time they were unearthed, the grave goods from these tombs struck both Mexican and Euro-American sensibili- ties as the product and manifestation of a lower rung of the evolutionary ladder. Lumholtz, who valued the tombs' anthro- pomorphic effigies mainly as documents,7 wrote that they were popularly dubbed monos (monkeys)-a nickname that remained in use even in the 1940s.8 In 1957 artist/scholar Miguel Covarrubias, an early collector and chronicler of West Mexican ceramics, bluntly labeled Nayarit effigies from Ixtlkin (Fig. 1) "subhuman monstrosities," and years later, eminent anthropologist Michael Coe dryly remarked that "it would be stretching a term unduly to call the various cultures of western Mexico... 'civilized.' "9 Well after a rail line linking Mexico's Pacific coast to its center was completed in 1927, West Mexico remained mar- ginal and unknown, its tombs excavated by looters rather than archaeologists. The ceramic effigies they yielded began to attract notice in Mexico City about 1930-when Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo began collecting them10-but throughout the next two decades, as Mesoamerica's high cultures were reappraised for audiences in the United States against a backdrop of enthusiastic Pan-Americanism,11 West Mexican clay production was consistently set apart. Holger Cahill, writing in the Museum of Modern Art's celebratory catalogue American Sources of Modern Art (1933), declared that while "ancient American art, in its best periods, cannot be called primitive," the archaistic ceramics of West Mexico were another matter, lacking the "refinement" of Maya sculpture and the "massive power" of Aztec carvings.12 Similarly, when several "Tarascan" effigies were included in the Museum of Modern Art's exhibition Twenty Centuries of Mexican Art (1940), Mexican archaeologist Alfonso Caso, having drawn a distinction between Mesoamerica's early cultures and the "Cultural Summit" that followed, noted the caricatural qual- ity and "unexcelled simplicity and purity" of West Mexican production-aspects, he wrote, that recalled "the archaic.""13 Though scholars' burgeoning interest in ancient West Mexico was signaled by a Mesa Redonda (roundtable conference sponsored by the Sociedad Mexicana de Antropologia) on the region convened in 1946, its clay production-particu- larly "the uncouth art of Nayarit"-continued to register as authentically primitive.14 The term primitive, once a freely applied diagnostic of non-European ways of life and styles of art, is now seen to denote a Euro-American conceit: a discursive formation posed against what is seen, from a given subject position, to constitute cultivation.15 Notions of the primitive vary with its framers, and it is alternately, even concurrently, vaunted and disparaged, desired and denigrated, as its "civilized" cartogra- phers measure themselves and their cultures against the shifting parameters by which they mark its domain.16 Frida Kahlo, for instance, suggested her own equivocal relation to the primitive embodied by a Nayarit effigy she owned in Self-Portrait with Small Monkey, 1945 (Fig. 2). One of a trio of satellites ranged about the artist's large, frontal form, the Nayarit figure is associated with the monkey and the native ixcuintli dog; all are markers of indigenous Mexicanness, here possessed, domesticated, and artfully displayed. Kahlo holds herself aloof from and superior (in position and scale) to her pets and her primitive, yet at the same time she portrays herself literally tied to the periphery they occupy, a space at the boundary of nature and culture. The ribbon connecting her to that place of the primitive-at once suggestive of hangman's noose, subjugating leash, and the cord connect- ing fetus to food source-indicates the artist's unruly entangle- ment with it. Diego Rivera's relation to the West Mexican effigies he and Kahlo collected was even more equivocal. Though he vaunted Nayarit's "cerimicas primitivas"17 and collected West Mexi-</page><page sequence="2">THE AFTERLIFE OF WEST MEXICAN BURIAL EFFIGIES 735 PLATE V I S b r d 1 Terra-cotta burial effigies, Ixtlin, Tam-antsa p, an the NeLbourhood of Inda-. from Lumholtz, vol. 2, pl. 5 can effigies by the dozens, allusions to this clay art rarely surfaced in his murals celebrating Mesoamerica's illustrious past, where references to the "high cultures" of the Aztec and Maya abound.'8 Still, Rivera usually is credited with sparking wider interest in West Mexican grave goods by way of his vast collection and its display.'" In the 1950s, West Mexican effigies became hot commodities on the Los Angeles art market, promoted by dealers Earl Stendahl and Ralph C. Altman,20 where they were snapped up by members of the movie colony as well as by collectors, including Jules Berman, a real estate developer and entrepreneur who found himself drawn to the "warmth and good humor" he found in West Mexican figuration.21 Within a decade or so, prime pieces were in short supply in Los Angeles, and West Mexican-style fakes inun- dated the market.22 Yet even as wary collectors shied away from them, the effigies' profile was raised in the 1960s as archaeological and anthropological interest accelerated23 and-in an altogether different domain-Berman put his West Mexican ceramics to work in print ads for Kahlfia, the coffee-flavored Mexican liqueur he had recently introduced to consumers in the United States (Fig. 3).24 From the mid-1960s until 1995, Kahlfia's promoters used West Mexican ceramics to fashion an alluring primitive that audiences in the United States might wish to display and consume. The brand's Pre-Columbian campaign, which ap- peared in national periodicals, including Life and Esquire, probably introduced more norteamericanos to ancient Mexican art than any sort of scholarly, museological, or "high art" discourse, though the ads did not insist on the origins of the pictured artifacts. Instead, Kahlua advertising capitalized on the relative anonymity of West Mexican effigies to co-opt them as readymade mascots and played on their striking unfamiliar- ity to style the liqueur as exotic and its imbibers as adventur- ous. The appropriation Berman initiated was sustained and successful; over the course of thirty years, West Mexico's onetime grave goods came to connote Kahlua more readily than Mexico (let alone Nayarit, Jalisco, or Colima).25 When in 1998 Ancient West Mexico became the subject of an exhibition and catalogue (respectively organized and edited by Richard Townsend of the Art Institute of Chicago), the show was subtitled "Art and Archaeology of the Unknown Past," an indication that though any distant past is largely unknowable, West Mexico's has been considered especially so. The exhibition's wall and catalogue texts summarized the findings and reconstructions of archaeologists, physical anthro- pologists, and ethnohistorians who have worked in West Mexico for the last forty years, and when Art Institute director James N. Wood characterized his museum's undertaking as a "project of recovery," he presumably alluded to this scientific salvation of a West Mexican past, in addition to the exhibi- tion's intellectual repositioning of a set of deracinated arti- facts within an antiquity that is increasingly "known."26" This essay, by contrast, makes little attempt to relocate Nayarit, Jalisco, and Colima ceramics in an actual past or rightful context. Instead, it examines the peregrinations resulting from these objects' detachment from their origins and ex- plores a series of dislocations facilitated by their lack of contextual baggage. Clearly, West Mexico's "unknownness" rendered its grave goods malleable signifiers, and ironically, the ceramics' relative anonymity both led to and coexisted with regular appearances in twentieth-century visual cul- ture.27 In chronicling Kahl'ia advertising's recontextualiza- tions of West Mexican grave goods, I explore ways in which the practices of collection and display emerge as imaginative enterprises and, in this vein, also examine the ways in which Rivera and Kahlo put the objects they owned into play.28 My primary focus, however, is the ad makers' fabrication-both conceptual and actual-of a range of primitives that were teased out of this unfamiliar body of ceramic production. Like many makers of "high art," Kahlia's successive promot- ers deployed artifacts of preindustrial peoples to construct versions of the primitive that varied with their makers' agendas. Paul Gauguin's primitive was not Pablo Picasso's, and--despite their mutual reliance on West Mexican grave goods as source materials-Kahlfa's primitives were not Kahlo's. Thus, I am interested not only in the ways that West Mexican ceramics were perceived but also in how those perceptions shaped and encouraged varied co-options and-in the case of Diego Rivera--discouraged them.29 West Mexican artifacts accommodated some versions of the primitive better</page><page sequence="3">736 ART BULLET'I'IN DECEMBER 2000 VOLUME LXXXII NUMBER 4 2 Frida Kahlo, Self-Portrait with Small Monkey, 1945.

The risible primitive that Kahluia fashioned from West Mexi- can effigies in the 1960s, moreover, was downplayed in brand ads of the 1970s and 1980s, only to be revived when Kahluia's ad writers launched a last-ditch effort to make the(ir) primi- tive "fun" again. The permutations on the primitive I chart in Kahluia ads may be seen to reflect-and, possibly, to inflect-shifts in broad-based perceptions and assumptions. Advertising, the product and manifestation of the consumer culture that is our common culture,30 is widely held to provide "a basis for plausible inference about popular attitudes and values," since prevailing wisdom holds that effective ads tap notions consum- ers already hold dear.i1 Audiences tend to consume ads-</page><page sequence="4">TIE AFTERLIFE OF IWEST MEXI(CAN RIAI EFFI(;IES 737 6M11" m o ard b as ihhes battled 3mck RZAs eIt aste~.... ut of this verdl f" "You're putting me o."

The Liqueur from Sunny Mexico When Jules Berman decided to market Kahlca nationally in 1960, the liqueur was scarcely consumed in the United States. While eager to capitalize on its novelty, Berman also desired its mass consumption; Kahlfia needed to be tagged offbeat but not off'-putting, exotic rather than alien. Thus, while the earliest ads for what Berman labeled "the liqueur from sunny Mexico" are punctutiated by exotic props that cast it as foreign (piiiatas and sombreros, as well as Mesoamerican artifacts), they are dominated by familiar names and faces (signs drawn from the system of' media celebrity) that attest to the brand's currency among au courant Americans (Figs. 4, 5).3 Eschew- ing the bottle-and-glass close-ups that dominated (and con- tinue to dominate) liquor advertising, Berman instead si- phoned meaning from known commodities onto his unknown one. "Personalities" rather than "stars," Kahlfia's first paid proponents, Vincent Price and Carl Reiner, were celebrities of somewhat quirky appeal who lent an air of attractive eccentric- ity to the liqueur they professed to prefer. Price (1911-1993) was a deep-voiced character actor who projected an air of cultivation (even when he came to be typecast in horror films exemplified by The House of Wax, 1953, and The Fly, 1958). Having studied art history at Yale and the University of London before his stage debut, he built a well-known art collection once his screen career took off.38 A longtime aficionado of "primitive" art, Price used his non-European acquisitions to style himself original,"' and though Jules Berman owned a number of Mesoamerican pieces by 1960,40 the first ad linking Kahlila to Pre-Columbian art featured Price's collection (Fig. 4).11 Dominated by a photograph of antiquities on display in the actor's home, the Price ad includes a textual "voice-over" in which the actor/collector asserts, "The art of America before Columbus will always hold historical fascination for me" because "I collect sensations." "And friom Mexico," he adds, "I learned of another sensa- tion.

Like Pre-Columbian art, Kahluia is purported to excite the senses, and both, the text suggests, provide an unaccustomed perspective on the commonplace that makes one consider it anew. The pictured artifacts that accompany Price's endorsement denote Mexico and stress Kahluia's putative origins.42 More generally, they connote a realm of otherness to which Price thrills-but which he has taken firmly in hand. He does not simply like Pre-Columbian art, he "collects" it-making it his, and (as the photo indicates) arranging it to his own satisfac- tion. In addition to affirming the legitimacy and prestige of Mesoamerican art, Price more significantly models Euro- American mastery of things foreign; his ad locates Kahlua- drinking under the rubric of gratifying domestication of otherness and assures readers that the "sensation" delivered by exotica is adaptable to familiar surroundings (the stairway in the entrance hall) and daily routines (the after-dinner drink) .4 Though typical in its insistence on the brand's exotic appeal, Price's endorsement was unusually high-toned. Other Kahlfia ads of this era reveal Berman's preference for the sort of insouciant sophistication comedian Carl Reiner enacted in contemporaneous promotions.44 Reiner (b. 1922), a well- known television personality, had been involved in that medium since its inception45 and in 1960 was beginning a six-year run in the cast of The Dick Van IDyke Show, which he created. Like Price, Reiner projected an air of cultivated nonconformity, but he did so with tongue in cheek, in ads that featured wisecracking copy and popular rather than historical artifacts. One, titled "Sounds of balalaikas" (Fig. 5), shows a multitude of Reiners in sombreros faced off against a contin- gent of fur-hatted Reiners, their juxtaposition emblematic of the Black Russian, a cross-cultural concoction of Kahlfia and vodka that became one of the brand's signature cocktails.'6 Standing between-and above-these unruly foreigners (in- terchangeable under their stereotypic markers of nationality) is the "real" (and singular) Reine;, wearing ambassador's attire, hence impersonating the Euro-American mediator who artfully allies volatile elements in a cocktail that consti- tutes a measured taste of otherness (two parts vodka, one part Kahlia). As in the Price ad, Kahluia's exoticism is marked as easily negotiable by a suave American, who in this case is willing to try it on for fun, like a silly hat. A subsequent series of ads featuring Helen Grayco, a singer of minor celebrity who was christened "Lady Kahlia" during her stint as the brand's spokesperson, expanded on the notion of Kahlfia's easily negotiated exoticism by introducing a feminine devotee whose ladylike demeanor and nonchalant poise were unruffled by flirtations with untamed foreignness. Though Grayco's appearances in Esquire painted Lady Kahluia as a footloose clotheshorse, the ads she posed for in periodi- cals of predominantly female readership portrayed her as a celebrity wife and a hostess with flair.47 In those capacities, she extolled Kahlfa's utility in the kitchen (for example, poured over ice cream or as a marinade for meats). Kahlfia's sales team decided early on that if they wanted Americans to buy an unfamiliar foreign liqueur, they would have to tell them what to do with it.48 In addition to providing hints for its consump- tion in print ads, the company published a booklet of recipes that, in the worldly-wise phrasing of one text, was "available on a moment's notice.... By the way, that moment is a Mexican moment. Have faith.4"" Kahluia recipes (then as now) were riffs on standard fare: chicken or chocolate cake enlivened by a dash of coffee liqueur.:'M The recipes' linguistic equivalent may be found in the bilingual copy the brand's ad writers favored (such as, "Hay muchos otros recipes for intriguing drinks and desserts"), where carefree slippage from tongue to tongue connotes exoticism, Kahlhia style: a manageable dose of otherness bracketed by the familiar.5' A similar admixture marked the Pre-Columbian-style de- canters designed to emphasize the brand's foreign allure. As an ad for them stated, "Famous authoi; lecturer, educator and primitive art expert [and dealer] Ralph C. Altman was asked to research the cultures of the Valley of Mexico for a decorative bottle.""'5 The resultant containers-ostensibly reflective of Euro-American erudition and expertise-are pastiches inspired by cultures well beyond Mexico's central valley (Fig. 6). As effigy vessels, they are conceptually related to containers made in ancient West Mexico (and by some Andean cultures); morphologically, however, they most often recall the more widely esteemed material culture of the Maya. Rather than mimic the surface look of any sort of Mesoameri- can vessel, however, Kahlfia's "decorative" decanters have high-gloss (and often luridly colored) finishes. Decidedly non-Mexican in medium, they were "handcrafted from pure</page><page sequence="6">THE AFTERLIFE OF WEST IMEXI(AN I' RIAI. EFFIGIES 739 6 Berman and Associates, Kahlfia decanter, 1960.

Amid bullfight posters, carousel horses, and talking bottles, Pre-Columbian artifacts and reproductions were seen only sporadically in Kahluia ads designed prior to 1965,51 though an ad of 1963 anticipates a key strategy of the concerted Pre-Columbian campaign initi- ated two years later. Titled "A party favorite from way back," it features twenty West Mexican ceramics arranged to evoke a convivial outdoor gathering (Fig. 7). An accompanying fine- print notice that "the partying pre-Columbians are from the famed Kahlfia collection" seems to have been Berman's first public assertion of the interconnectedness of his private collection and professional enterprise-a linkage by which products of unknown makers were rendered part of a "famed" (or at least named) collection,"" and their prized antiquity lent the veneer of a venerable pedigree to a novel product of obscure origins.'" Announcement of their union seems to mark the nascence of Berman's decision to use his Mesoameri- can ceramics in brand promotion, an idea, according to his longtime public relations adviser, Sheldon Marks, that re- sutilted from the collector's sudden realization that many of Kahlia- a party favorite from way back Kahlda was very big with the pre-Columbian crowd.

Through Marks's efforts, Berman's collec- tion came to be characterized as one that highlighted "the warmth and good humor inherent in ... Pre-Hispanic figu- rines ... [whose] facial expressions and bodily attitudes cover the gamut of human emotions.'"58 The effigies' supposed "good humor" became the focus of the party ad of 1963. Whereas earlier Kahluia promotions presented Mesoamerican sculptures as static artifacts on display (Fig. 4), this Pre-Columbian fete galante invited the viewer to imagine the casually clustered effigies as animate ancient counterparts. By holding out the suggestion that "partying pre-Columbians" pursued pleasure in much the same way that partying Americans did, the photo parlayed a fiction of parallelism that was compounded by the text's claim that Kahli'a-"Made in Mexico from a recipe that dates to antiquity"-"was very big with the pre-Columbian crowd.'""'5 Positing a communality that bridged then and now, there and here, the ad reflects (and fosters) a notion of global and panhistoric universality that had become a commonplace of Euro-American thinking on otherness, exemplified, for in- stance, by Carl Sandberg's prologue to The Family of Man (1955), in which the author asserts, "Alike and ever alike we are on all continents in the need of love, food, clothing, work, speech, worship, sleep, games, dancing, ftin.

Though Jules Berman sold the brand to Hiram Walker and Sons in 1964, he remained as a corporate officer in charge of brand develop- ment through 1970. During that era, Kahlha advertising took a new tack, as cultural boundaries already blurred by Kahluia's Pre-Columbian party scene were further eroded in ads that gave Mesoamerican effigies "voices," in the form of texts held beside them in quotation marks (Figs. 3, 8-12). Mouthing lines reflecting contemporary mores, the "talking" effigies became comic surrogates for the modern consumer rather than counterparts from a distant time and place. Oddly enough, given earlier ads' playful bilingualism and occasional forays into ethnic stereotyping, the effigies in Kahluia's "talk- ies" don't "sound" Mexican. Instead, their speeches, most often centered on the sort of laughable domestic discord common to television sitcoms such as I Love Lucy or The Honeymooners,"' serve to imbue alien-looking entities with moods and motivations audiences of the United States readily recognize."' In "Dexter" (1968), for instance, a female figure from Colima chides a conch-blowing male Colima effigy for inhaling the last K&amp;B (Kahluia and brandy) fumes from an empty "coffee pot" (Fig. 8).63 At the same time, Kahliia ads of this era tapped Western tropes of the "savage" in figures whose manufacture, propor- tions, and adornment marked them as primitive and that performed irrational, violent, and childlike characters whose Kahluia fixations drove them to "uncivilized" behaviors. In unabashed homage to The Honeymooners, an ad of 1965 re-presents joined male adversaries as a Kramden-like man and wife at odds over her depletion of the Kahluia supply (Fig. 9). The transformation of warrior and captive to contemporary squabbling spouses (if buttressed by the visual cue of an uncapped Kahluka bottle) is actually effected by the aggressor's boldface print exclamation and its monologic continuation in smaller type, which concludes: "Boy, one of these days ... Pow, right in the sipper!"-a spin on Ralph Kramden's notorious threat.64 A reversal of that scenario is detailed in an ad of the following year, "Honey, I promise," which presents the man of the house as the victim of a domestic scuffle (Fig. 10). He is played by a seated effigy from Jalisco whose open mouth, wide-eyed expression, and gesture toward a lumpy shoulder are recontextualized by speech addressed to an unseen male confidant (whose position is assumed by the reader): the "wounded" man notes that none of his many misdeeds was as irritating to his wife as his failure to buy more Kahluia, an oversight that made her "hysterical." Amends were made, he adds, when "she brought me a box of Kahluia brownies ... in the hospital." That Kahlu?a-fueled spousal abuse should emerge as a leitmotiv in these suppos- edly comedic ads not only indicates previous insensitivity to a social problem now taken seriously but also reflects Western expectations of-and titillation by-the primitive. The smaller, speechless figure of "Honey, I promise" is cast as the chastened wife. Hollow clay effigies of the sort coupled in this ad often were made and displayed as matched male/female pairs,65 though this mixed marriage joins the Jalisco figure with a female effigy from Nayarit, presumably on the basis of similarities of size and shoulder ornament.66 It is the disparity of their postures and expressions, however, that creates visual interest, and this aspect of the pairing may have inspired the ad's "story." Within the context of the com- plaints registered by the ad's male protagonist, the female figure's downcast eyes, lowered chin, and folded arms, which might originally have connoted restfulness or sleep (espe- cially given its burial function), suggest shame, resignation, and/or controlled rage. Typically, Kahlta ads of this era relied on viewer recogni- tion of, amusement at, and participation in creative misinter- pretations of ancient sculptures' attitudes and attributes,67 as when a Nayarit percussionist's boldface lament allows the viewer to see his rasp as a grater (Fig. 11). Such rereadings depend on the texted remarks conjoined to the figures, whose vernacular "speech" serves not only to humanize but also to recontextualize and Americanize them. In this respect, grafted monologues do for Berman's sculptures what regu- larly published recipes did for his brand: distrust of otherness is allayed by telling consumers what to make of it, literally (in the case of the recipes) and figuratively (in the case of the sculptures). Kahlta recipes encouraged consumers' experi-</page><page sequence="8">THE AFTERLIFE OF WEST MEXICAN BURIAL EFFIGIES 741 "So we ran out of Kahlia again! Boy, one of these days...

Of course, in television's comedic visions of 1960s suburbia, the folks next door might well be aliens, witches, or genies,68 and Kahlua ads of this era drew on and contributed to a popular convention that might be called the outlander in the subdivision.69 "Out of this world" (1966), a topical takeoff on UFO sightings (which reached a peak that year),70 is a prime example (Fig. 3). As two big-headed, square-bodied Nayarit figures enact a friendly exchange, an even odder-looking figure eavesdrops, its exclamatory physiognomy well-suited to an appended assertion of feigned surprise at the flat footed Kahlua drinker's mention of things otherworldly. The eaves- dropper's extravagant coiffure (a distinguishing feature of Jalisco male effigies of the Zacatecas substyle) clearly sug- gested antennae to the ad's writers, who cast the effigy as the jovial alien among us, a spaceman who-in the manner of My Favorite Martian of prime-time TV-is more eccentric than threatening.7' The boxed text below underscores this read- ing, as it urges readers to embrace the unknown by "Toast- [ing] Flying Saucers with Kahlfia Kups," chocolate drinking vessels that are described as "UFOs (Unique Fillable Objects)." 10 Berman and Associates, "Honey, I promise," 1966 It seems especially apt that "Out of this world" touts the Black Russian cocktail, the very name of which, in the United States of the mid-1960s, must have suggested an amalgam of profoundest otherness. "Black" was just emerging as a politi- cized racial descriptor,72 and Russians were the most fearsome of terrestrial outlanders in the collective consciousness of the United States, not only longtime antagonists in the Cold War but adversaries in the contested terrain of the "new frontier" of outer space. A quintessential melting-pot concoction, the Black Russian was a New World twist on an Old World commodity, an American adulteration (and sweetening) of something essentially Russian, a playfully transgressive muddy- ing of clear-cut distinctions. Playful transgression likewise informs the practice of imbu- ing abnormal-looking entities with ordinary speech, an act that destabilizes us/them distinctions and literally "makes fun of" (that is, generates merriment from, rather than pointedly ridiculing) otherness. The anonymous authors of "Out of this world" invite consumers to join them in scoffing at anxieties engendered by things beyond their ken, and this ad-in its combination of unfamiliar artifacts, references to outer space, and a popular expression that designates things beyond the pale as superlative-stresses the appeal of the outlandish, especially when contained.73 In the countercultural 1960s, "far out" was an affirmation of wondrous excellence,74 and</page><page sequence="9">742 ART BUI.I.ETIN DECEMBER 2000 VOLUME I.XXXII NUMBER 4 "JAst me you'd . tlnk I oeoud paur the KahIE. gtd "I never said I didn' like lemon tropi-Kaliu desset But I know the rounem.

Kahlia ads played on this emerging inclination, but-following televi- sion's lead-reassuringly staged surreal encounters on the consum- er's own turf. Juxtapositions of familiar speech and unfamiliar forms served not only to tame the exotic and alien but also to enliven the everyday. Whereas "Out of this world" draws attention to the effigies' oddities with verbal equivalents of rib-nudging, the tone of delivery in most Kahluia ads is deadpan: the figures' offbeat looks is unacknowledged, and the humor residing in the tension between the strangeness of the effigies' appearances and the mundane preoccupations they are made to intone presented as self-evident (Figs. 8, 11). Antiquities deployed in scenes of mundane domesticity put new spins on old routines. Describing the genesis of Kahluia's talkies, Sheldon Marks commented, "Once, while visiting with Mr. Berman, as he sat surrounded by dozens of Pre-Columbians, I was moved to remark, 'I'll bet if your friends here could talk, they'd have something interesting to say about Kahluia.' And, with a little imagination on our parts, they've been saying it ever since."'75 Surely an abridged version of the process that led Berman to use his collection to promote Kahluia, this coy account seems to have been intended to make the sculptures' use as brand mascots seem natural, even preordained. Presenting a set of imperious presumptions as an exercise in whimsicality, Marks ascribes consciousness to "the Pre-Columbians" but with- holds true subjectivity from these imaginary "friends," whose amenable interest in Kahlua is assumed.76 His construction subserves the claim that he and Berman merely enabled the figures to say what they would say if they could, and is itself served by a semantic maneuver Marks doubtless performed almost unconsciously: the sculptures' individuality is dimin- ished, their imaginative co-option facilitated, by the applica- tion of the collective identifier "Pre-Columbians." Marks used a broad chronological adjective as if it were a noun denoting a particular people.77 As such, "Pre-Columbian" functions as ethnic labels (such as Hispanic) often do: it is an inclusive mantle of otherness beneath which the differences within difference go unremarked.78 Subsumption of the sculptures' specificity (that is, that of their makers and their intended uses) conduced to Marks's tendency to see and portray Berman's collection as a wealth of empty vessels (what W. Jackson Rushing might call "signifiers without signi- fieds"79), which Kahluia's marketers offered up for refilling by the ads' mass audience.80 Though Marks's casual synopsis might lead the reader to believe that Berman's "Pre-Columbians" were as indistinguish- able from one another as the "Mexicans" posed by Carl Reiner, the sculptures appropriated for Kahlfia promotion were carefully chosen; they represent small facets of Meso- american figuration and particular portions of Berman's own collection. Much of the sculptural production of Mesoameri- ca's "high cultures" (Olmec, Maya, Toltec, Aztec) is lithic. Formally, it ranges from naturalistic to highly abstract; icono- graphically, it tends to be devoted to elites and to supernatu- ral entities and events and frequently references complex mythologies and belief systems (some components of which remain only marginally and speculatively decipherable). Though Berman's collection included such Olmec, Maya, and Aztec stone carving, the sculptures used to sell Kahluia from 1963 onward were figural ceramics produced by the so-called village cultures of West Mexico and Veracruz,81 cultures known for their depictions of the human form and physiognomy in a wide variety of attitudes.82 Lacking what Holger Cahill characterized as "Aztec ferocity or the tropical luxuriance of the Maya," such ceramics, in Cahill's estima- tion, had "much that makes direct appeal to contemporary European and American taste."83 Like West Mexican ceramics, Veracruzano effigies were made by peripheral groups that lacked writing systems; they, too, had been collected but little studied in the early twenti- eth century. The unpretentious medium, unimposing scale, seemingly uncomplicated iconography, and often murky provenances of both these provincial clay traditions served to deflect serious and sustained scholarly attention, and in the 1960s few "facts" and narratives had accrued to either. The assessments they generated were more impressionistic than analytic: Veracruzano pieces were commonly characterized as "expressive" and "exuberant,"84 while West Mexican ones (less in line with Euro-American aesthetic norms) were noted for the unnatural proportions and exaggerated features that marked them "caricaturesque.""5 Evocation of quotidian rather than ritualistic activity was assumed in West Mexican pieces-which Michael Coe labeled "genre art in clay"-and</page><page sequence="10">TIE AFTERLIFE ()F WEST MEXICAN BURIAl. EFFIGIES 743 their anecdotal and egalitarian aspects were often remarked: "Familiar subjects and humorous vignettes dominate the art of all Western Mexico. ... [There] the common villager was held in greater esteem than in the more rigidly class- structured societies of the rest of Mesoamerica, where priests and princes dominated the iconography."86 Though he did not specify them, Marks surely was referring to the Veracruzano and West Mexican pieces in Berman's collection when he wrote of their owner's recognition of the sculptures' "true-to-life attitudes and situations." The fact that he and Berman earmarked village-culture ceramics for Kahluia advertising indicates awareness that these pieces' focus on the human form, paucity of arcane references, and resultant legibility distinguished them from other sorts of Mesoamerican sculpture-and made them better suited to mass-market address. Though village-culture ceramics cer- tainly bespoke foreignness, their exoticism was fairly generic; for modern audiences they did not carry the specific cultural associations Aztec or Maya pieces did. Their lack of contextual baggage as they entered house- holds in the United States made such effigies highly suscep- tible to the sorts of decontextualizations Judith Williamson has noted in advertisers' appropriation of historical materi- als.87 References to the figures' probable uses, presumed meanings, and/or producing cultures are absent from the texts of Kahltia ads, some of which mix effigies from different regions and cultures in grab-bag assemblages of the sort once seen in European cabinets de curiositis (a display form long favored by the merchant class).88 One such ad, "Separate checks," evokes a crowded bar scene where various effigies jostle one another, all calling for drinks (Fig. 12). While showcasing a range of ancient types (in order to stress the variety of Kahlia cocktails) this melange simultaneously ratifies the viewer's likely impression thatjuxtaposed regional types are of a piece (just as the drinks named above them are variations on a single liqueur). Whether they appear singly or grouped, the individual effigies that promote Kahlia are presented as part of a larger body of artifacts: a generic primitive marked not only by noncompliance with Western conventions of beauty, propriety, and politesse but also by its makers' anonymity."8 This orphaned status makes it tractable, as Marianna Torgovnick has observed: "The primitive does what we ask it to do. Voiceless, it lets us speak for it.... The primitive can be-has been, will be (?)-whatever Euro- Americans ask it to be.'"o' In fixing on village-culture ceramics to embody their brand, Berman and Marks chose virtually "voiceless" artifacts. Within this select group, the West Mexican ceramics in Kahluia advertising outnumbered Veracruzanos by almost four to one before 1980;"' thereafter, Kahlia ads featured West Mexican pieces exclusively."2 The ad teams' marked preference for them probably relates to the more pronounced otherness of West Mexican effigies, which underscored Kahlia's often- stressed exoticism, and to their perceived "absurdity,"g" which (in the early years, at least) complemented the wry tone the brand's copywriters favored and proved particularly con- genial to the send-ups of middle-class life that were the bread and butter of Kahlia advertising through the early 1970s. The ceramics' human subject matter and supposed depiction of mundane activities enabled them to stand in for middle-class "Kahhia "Kahlia "Kahl So." Mai Tai." on-the-rocks."

Rustics out of context, the "hillbil- lies," like the West Mexican effigies of Kahluia ads, were at once buffoonish and endearing, a primitive to which the viewer could feel affectionately superior (and perhaps secretly allied).97 No Laughing Matter: The West Mexicos of Rivera and Kahlo The benevolent condescension directed at West Mexican effigies by Berman's team is no more unique to Kahlia ads of</page><page sequence="11">744 ART BULLETIN DECEMBER 2000 VOLUME LXXXII NUMBER 4 the later 1960s than is the clownish primitive those ads construct. In Mexico, as in the United States, the effigies long had been perceived as figures of fun; in 1941, even as Gilbert Medioni sought to make the West Mexican ceramics Diego Rivera owned "better known ... from the plastic point of view," he observed that "these good fellows," or "monos, as they are called in Mexico" (comprising "hunchbacks, fat people, the deformed, large or misshapen women") "consti- tute a gallery of grotesques remarkable for their gentleness" and "tender humor."98 Though nowhere more patently manifest than in Berman-era Kahhla ads that play it to the hilt, the air of foolishness deduced from the effigies' ungainly proportions, rugged manufacture, and unlikely toilettes was long and widely remarked, and it seems to me that Rivera's noted reluctance to quote West Mexican figuration in his nationalist murals is most profitably examined against percep- tions of the effigies' laughable primitivism. Medioni's remarks preface Art in Ancient Mexico, a photo- graphic survey that (despite the breadth of its title) is limited to West Mexican ceramics from Rivera's collection.99 The quantity and variety of pieces represented there suggest the artist's enthusiasm for this "collective, popular, certainly anonymous" clay production.100 Not surprisingly, Medioni's essay, produced in the service of Rivera's collection, echoes some of the artist's recorded sentiments, most notably, his conviction that West Mexican idolos (as Rivera called them) were the secular products of an egalitarian society of ancient campesinos0io and, as such, powerful antecedents to the vital and admirable traditions of Mexican popular art and folk art. 102 It has been supposed that Rivera's leftist politics and bourgeois idealization of a rustic proletariat spurred his interest in West Mexican ceramics,103 which he began to acquire in the 1930s;104 the fact that they were abundantly available and relatively inexpensive during the era in which he built his vast collection of Pre-Columbian art may also explain their prominence there.'05 Rivera's recorded impres- sions of West Mexican ceramics are, however, few and vague. He found them "extraordinary," "marvelous," and "amaz- ing,"106 but left scholars to speculate on the specifics of such effigies' appeal for him. Thus, Peter Furst suggests that in addition to its presumed "freedom from religious con- straints," Rivera appreciated the "exuberance of form and variety of style and subject matter of West Mexican art"; Barbara Braun that "Rivera cherished [its] formal inventive- ness, exoticism, and frank expression of death and sex."''7 I find it likely that many of the observations made in Art in Ancient Mexico reflect Rivera's views, and, given Medioni's detailed description of the myriad ways in which West Mexi- can ceramics are humorously grotesque, I suspect that Rivera himself appreciated the burlesque aspects of Nayarit, Jalisco, and Colima effigies so widely noted by his contemporaries.1'08 Indeed, it is not inconceivable that Rivera, an outsize man with a froglike countenance even his wives found ugly, engaged in a conscious gesture of self-parody in acquiring and displaying effigies that many considered endearingly misshapen.109 I also suspect that these figures' perceived primitivism and "absurdity," if appealing to Rivera the collec- tor, made their incorporation in his public art problematic; surely such traits were uncongenial to the celebratory recon- structions of Mexico's Pre-Columbian civilization that so engaged him in his maturity. Having spent several years in Europe, Rivera returned to his native Mexico in 1921 keenly interested in the country's Pre-Columbian past. Like many European modernists, he embraced a traditionalist aesthetic in the wake of World War I.110 Rejecting the Cubist idiom he had mastered in the company of Piet Mondrian, Robert Delaunay, Pablo Picasso, and Juan Gris, Rivera had concluded his European sojourn with a year and a half in Italy, where he not only fell under the spell of Byzantine and Renaissance murals but also examined Mexican codices of both the colonial and Pre-Columbian eras. Once back in Mexico, he became an active proponent of the indigenist movement that flowered after the revolution of 1910-20 and promoted resurrection of long-suppressed na- tive cultural and artistic practices. Taking Byzantine mosaics and Renaissance frescoes as models of exemplary popular address, Rivera aimed to celebrate Mexicanidad and indianismo in the most public and traditional of forums. The allegorical tenor of his first commissioned murals soon gave way to historical themes and Social Realism, rendered with great clarity in monumental works intended to introduce a mass audience to its own heritage and to the artist's Marxist- inspired revolutionary ideology (Figs. 13, 14).111' The simpli- fied forms, deflated volumes, and strong linearity of Rivera's murals, along with their comminglings of flattened and perspectival space, reflect the artist's embrace of an Old World primitive (in the mode of Paolo Uccello or Henri Rousseau) rather than indigenous idioms of the New World.'12 Despite Rivera's oft-stated desire to ground his work in native traditions, his murals bear little formal resemblance to the pre-Hispanic wall (or vase) paintings of Mesoamerica, and his particular style of abstract figuration has closer counter- parts in Euro-American modernism than in ancient Meso- american art (though it bears some affinity with the stream- lined stylizations of Aztec sculpture).113 In affirmation of his rootedness, however, Rivera punctuated European-looking pictorial spaces with references to Mexican popular art and multiple quotations of Pre-Columbian imagery, from Maya figuration to Aztec carvings and sixteenth-century codices.114 Amid these multiple nods to Mexico's ancient heritage, West Mexican burial effigies are scarcely referenced, despite the fact that they were scattered about Rivera's studio and continued to be prominently displayed in La Casa Azul, the house he and Kahlo shared in Coyoacin."5 Betty Ann Brown finds his "neglect of these agricultural village-dwellers" puzzling in light of Rivera's "Marxist politics," frequent depiction of modern Mexican peasants, and collector's inter- est in West Mexican grave goods, and wonders if they struck him as "insufficient in either exotic appeal or cultural sophistication.""6 It seems improbable that Rivera found his Nayarit, Jalisco, and Colima effigies "insufficiently exotic"; commentators in both Mexico and the United States considered them abun- dantly so. Quite probably, however, the ceramics' primitivism (that is, lack of "cultural sophistication") was formally and associatively at odds with his efforts to aggrandize pre- Hispanic civilization for a mass audience-and himself.

Mexico City, Palacio Nacional (photo: Michel Besson) "historic Europe and its culture," 117 Rivera sought to exorcise feelings of inadequacy in postcolonial restitutions of a majes- tic precolonial Mexico, populated by masterful, industrious, and beautiful indigenes. In so doing, he practiced a European- based, anti-academic primitivism, its simplifications meant to convey sincerity, directness, and candor; albeit representa- tional, his mature style reflects conscious rejection of urbane affectations. 118 In contrast to Rivera's purposeful naivete, West Mexican sculptures' departures from naturalism were seen to consti- tute an "uncivilized" primitivism that resulted from the ceramists' unevolved condition rather than aesthetic choice. At the time Rivera collected them, West Mexican pieces were widely regarded as Tarascan, hence, coeval with the Aztec production,119 and, misdated by a millennium, were attrib- uted to rustic "folk" who lived outside the loop-the hillbil- lies, as it were, of Mesoamerican civilization. The West Mexican ceramists' penchant for exaggeration (which Covar- rubias identified as "a marked tendency in all the art of Western Mexico") and grotesquerie (poised at "the limits of absurd, brutal caricature") could be seen as diametrically opposed to Rivera's tendency to generalize, even ennoble, the indigenes in his murals.120 The monos of West Mexico, perceived as ridiculously clumsy in attitude and adornment as well as manufacture, could not signify in the ways that the nationalist iconographer needed Mesoamerica's material cul-</page><page sequence="13">746 ART BULLETIN DECEMBER 2000 VOLUME LXXXII NUMBER 4 14 Rivera, grisaille panel below Tarascan Civilization, 1942. Mexico City, Palacio Nacional (photo: Michel Besson) ture to signify; the cultural backwardness and comedic earthi- ness they bespoke surely dissuaded Rivera from showcasing them. Even his mural depiction Tarascan Civilization (1942) at Mexico's Palacio Nacional (Fig. 13), which naturally holds more references to "Tarascan" ceramics than any other of his murals, appears but marginally indebted to the clay art Rivera owned in abundance by the time he painted it. The distinctive roofs seen in the fresco's middle ground derive from Nayarit village scenes,121 and the figures standing at far right (holding a screen-fold manuscript and a swaddled infant) are adorned in distinctly Nayarit fashion,22 although their physiognomies, postures, and accoutrements have little to do with West Mexican prototypes.'23 Some of the mural's other figures wear Nayarit-style nose rings and headgear, and some assume postures that may derive from West Mexican figuration,124 but most are simply and generically clad, lack the tattooing and jewelry common to Nayarit effigies, and bear more physical resemblance to Central Mexican and Maya peoples than to the men and women portrayed in Nayarit figural sculpture (the "enormous feet, protuberant genitals, ridicu- lously thin arms and large, sharp noses" that Covarrubias later described125). The same holds true in three grisaille panels Rivera painted below the main scene, of which the central one depicts the manufacture of clay effigies by both male and female cera- mists (Fig. 14).126 The female sculptor, stocky, bare-breasted, and wearing a twisted headdress common to the region, looks somewhat more West Mexican than her male counterpart,'27 but both are stylized in a manner that reflects Rivera's</page><page sequence="14">THE AFTERLIFE OF WEST MEXICAN BURIAL EFFIGIES 747 interests in Aztec sculpture and European abstraction-and his rejection of West Mexican aesthetics in his own work. Each of these painted craftspeople works on a human effigy with both arms raised and flexed, a posture atypical of West Mexican ceramics. And if the unabashed nudity of the ceramic figure being made in the foreground relates it to West Mexican exemplars, its voluptuous curves and provoca- tive pose (contrived to lift and project the breasts) are as revealing of Rivera's enthusiasm for Western conventions of feminine allure as of his appreciation for the candor with which West Mexican artists depicted gendered bodies.128 In addition to this female effigy in progress, two other figural ceramics-both based on well-known Colima-style proto- types-appear in the panel's foreground, each representative of an indigenous type Rivera cherished: the hardworking campesino and the native American ixcuintli dog.129 Though Rivera's personal style appears scarcely inflected by his experi- ence of West Mexican ceramics,130 his depiction of this workshop sheds light on his interest in this material: docu- ments of a centuries-old tradition of popular arts production, the effigies also were presumed manifestations of an uncompli- cated egalitarian society that valued basic tasks and mundane pleasures enough to commemorate them in clay. If ill suited to his project of public address, such ceramics' prominent display in the spaces of Rivera's professional and domestic life indicates private resonance. As nationalist iconog- rapher, Rivera touted progressive agendas he deemed crucial to Mexico's future and linked the nation's twentieth-century wherewithal to the savvy, science, and sedulity of its "high" ancestral civilizations. At the same time, he was a son of provincial Guanajuato who constructed nostalgic narratives around past and present folk art, in which he saw an age-old "genio de pueblo" that no amount of colonialist meddling had been able to eradicate.'31 Disturbed by recent degrada- tions of Mexican folk art by modification and commodifica- tion,'32 Rivera hoarded his "ceramicas primitivas" and avidly acquired traditionalist artifacts in attempts to shore up authenticity in his own realm and (in the manner of Lum- holtz) to rescue a "vanishing primitive" for posterity.'33 The select objects Rivera placed around him also gave material form to aspects of self-narration; as Virginia Dominguez points out, ethnographic objects intrigue mod- ern viewers not so much for what they reveal about their makers as for "their perceived contribution to our understand- ing of our own historical trajectory."'34 "Primitive" objects, linked by convention to "childish" peoples (irrational, weak, and emotive, yet pure) and, by extension, to the childhoods of civilizations, may have spoken to Rivera's sense of origins. He once characterized Nayarit effigies as juguetes (toys or playthings), a word choice that may be elucidated by Jean Baudrillard's observation that "the fascination for hand- made or native products..,. arises less from their picturesque variety than from the anteriority of their forms or their manufacture, and from the allusion they contain to an earlier world-invariably a throwback to the world of our childhood and its playthings."'35 Clearly, the primitive objects she and Rivera collected spoke to Kahlo in that manner; West Mexican effigies make several appearances in an oeuvre that mirrors her self-absorption. Quoting them more often and more fruitfully than Rivera, Kahlo capitalized on the ceramics' homegrown look in expressions of her personal Mexicanidad and mined their striking otherness in meditations on her own alienation from the cultural and emotional mainstream. A polio survivor and the victim of a disfiguring accident in her youth,136 Kahlo regarded the effigies' perceived distortions from the view- point of one deformed; herself an enactor of provocative grotesquerie (particularly in its age-old form of gender- bending), Kahlo was doubtless drawn to that aspect of West Mexican figuration.137 Whereas Rivera's regard for such effigies might be characterized as an insider's appreciation for outsider art, Kahlo, herself a committed outsider, portrayed the ceramics she lived amid as attuned companions and personal extensions.138 In an early self-portrait, On the Border between Mexico and the United States (1932), Kahlo implies that West Mexican artifacts were as rooted in native soil as endemic vegetation.'"9 Subse- quently, West Mexican figuration fostered her wistful envision- ing of infancy and girlhood in My Nurse and I (1937) and Four Inhabitants of Mexico City (1938), both of which suggest that the artist had been nourished from childhood by the Pre- Columbian heritage that in turn rooted her.140 Kahlo's use of West Mexican ceramics in pictorial reconstructions of her past seem to exemplify Baudrillard's observation that antiqui- ties call up myths of origin.141 Artifacts signify time, and imagined mastery of time may be suggested by their posses- sion and manipulation.142 "Islands of legend, such objects carry human beings back beyond time to their childhood-or perhaps even farther still, back to a pre-birth reality," Baudril- lard writes. "No escape is more radical than escape in time, none so thoroughgoing as escape into one's own childhood."'43 In The Wounded Table (1940) Kahlo, injured and aggrieved by her recent divorce from Rivera, stages such escape: between two theatrical-looking curtains, she sets her adult self in a childish world occupied by youngsters, a pet, and a group of life-size juguetes that the artist has ranged about the gruesome-looking table like dolls at a child's make-believe tea party (Fig. 15).144 Kahlo's recidivistic self appears loosely tethered to the overgrown skeleton and papier-miche Judas (both drawn from contemporary folk art),,'1 but she is most emphatically coupled with the venerable Nayarit effigy at her left. Drawing on West Mexico's tradition of joined figural pairs, the artist presents herself and the primitive figure as symbionts, his tubelike arm merging with hers and supplant- ing her right hand.'46 It is this sustaining bond between the adult, wounded Kahlo and the anachronistic (hence transpos- ing) West Mexican primitive that is hauntingly resurrected in Self-Portrait with Small Monkey (Fig. 2), which finds Kahlo tied to the margins that animals and artifact occupy, and both anchored to the past and released from her present by the emaciated Nayarit "mourner" figure,'47 whose pathetic as- pect seems both to echo and respond to Kahlo's own dark mood in an era of mounting illness and anxiety. In play with Kahlo's sense of self and escapist fantasies, the physical oddities and evocative rawness of West Mexican burial effigies became well-integrated components of a pro- vocative private symbology, whose opacity was well served by the ceramics' eccentricities and enigmas. Though Kahlo's own recollections suggest otherwise, it seems likely that her</page><page sequence="15">748 ART BULLETIN DECEMBER 2000 VOLUME I.XXXII NUMBER 4 15 Kahlo, The Wounded Table, 1940. Location unknown affinity for West Mexican ceramics helped open Rivera's eyes to their intriguing qualities.'48 The profundity of that affinity, and of its impact on Kahlo's work, was acknowledged by Rivera himself when he wrote of her as one of a contingent of "definitively Mexican" painters who had positioned them- selves within the tradition of the "remote and extraordinary" Tarascans of Colima and Nayarit.'49 Many of the couple's West Mexican effigies remain today at the Kahlo house in Coyoacin. The bulk of Rivera's tomb art, however, is housed at Anahuacalli, the museum he built, stocked, and presented to the nation on his death, "a home," he said, "for my idols."'15 Rivera's private collection was Mexico's largest, a self-affirming assemblage that reified his success and his Mexicanidad. Like the assemblage it housed, Anahuacalli was built to affirm the praiseworthy past and auspicious present of Rivera and his compatriots: its command- ing stone mass, rising from cactus-studded lava beds, bespeaks permanence and strength born of ancient and indigenous materials and traditions. Inside, the number and variety of objects on view attest to the prodigious inventiveness of Mexico's ancient cultures and suggest the inherent power of multitude, though Rivera's tendency to view Mesoamerica through a falsely unifying Aztec lens is everywhere appar- ent."51 Anahuacalli's West Mexican effigies, though numer- ous, make scant impact against the prevailing aesthetic of severity and regularity. The western ceramics' idiosyncrasies and supposed jocularity did not serve the imposing vision of ancient and modern Mexico that Rivera publicly proffered, and, at Anahuacalli, they are subsumed by it. Having It Both Ways; or, The Unknown Made Famous Comparison of the ways in which Rivera and Berman used the material remains of ancient Mesoamerica reveals some funda- mental similarities. On a very basic level, both the artist and the entrepreneur were propagandists who played to a broad consumer base; 52 more specifically, each pitched an idea of Mexico that was rendered visible only by selective (rather than comprehensive or "accurate") references to its Pre-Colum- bian art. Each played with remnants of Mexico's past, arrang- ing and imaginatively reanimating them.'53 Radical differ- ences in their aims and strategies also are apparent. Despite Rivera's personal appreciation of West Mexican ceramics, his art tended to tap instead the most sophisticated visual culture of Classic and Post-Classic Mesoamerica in order to furnish a grand and powerful past in which Mexicans could take pride. Berman, who linked his brand from the start to the construct he called "Sunny Mexico"-a tourist destination rather than a world power"54-chose less prepossessing examples of its ancient art (indeed, the very sorts of objects Rivera labeled juguetes), and, as I have shown, Berman and his ad team manipulated them with a whimsicality that made the playful- ness of their practice obvious. Whereas Rivera was inclined to quote well-known "masterworks" in a spirit of homage and counted on viewer recognition of the pieces and styles he cited, Berman relied on viewer ignorance (since ignorance facilitated misrepresentation) of the little-known objects he chose for co-optive reuse-artifacts of scant prestige that had routinely garnered more amusement than reverence. While Rivera's ideological commitment to collectivity led him to envision ancient Mexico as a nation of resemblant entities living and acting in concert,155 Berman, the capitalist entrepre- neur, was drawn to manifestations of individualism in village- culture ceramics, and he even accentuated the quirks that helped particular effigies enact "characters" that stood out. Ironically, then, though Rivera and Berman may well have seen West Mexican effigies in much the same light, the "naive humor" and eccentricity that had limited the ceramics' usefulness to Rivera's enterprise ensured their success in Berman's. By the late 1960s, Kahluia ads had come to rely exclusively on figures that Berman, having chosen and paid for, felt entitled to toy with. A spirit of proprietary license informed their handling, and photographs of his pieces were freely altered.'56 The ad team made the most of West Mexican "drinker" figures Berman owned,"57 massaged more unusual accoutrements (like a rasp or conch-shell trumpet) into recognizability, and downsized or enlarged figures (vis-i-vis one another and/or the standard Kahluia bottle) as layout demanded. Figures with props not easily airbrushed or explained away (such as nursing infants or trophy heads) did not get starring roles; likewise, esoteric beliefs and practices generally went unmentioned in Kahlfia copy.'58 The effigies</page><page sequence="16">THE AFTERLIFE OF WEST MEXICAN BURIAL EFFIGIES 749 put into play were those that most handily accommodated the contrived subjectivities projected onto them by copywriters and consumers alike. In an era of celebrity endorsements- the strategy Kahlfia ads originally adopted-using the effigies as hucksters was akin to casting unknowns in a film. While they lacked the ready allure that accompanies fame, the ceramics were easily subsumed by assigned roles. So long as Kahlua was pitched by the likes of Vincent Price, Carl Reiner, or even Helen Grayco, it was destined to share the spotlight; the unsung effigies, by contrast, were easily co-opted, the shards of meaning they carried pre-Kahlua readily eclipsed by their association with the product. Ideally suited to brand promotion, they seemed to come from nowhere but the company itself. In the 1960s, a slight decline in celebrity endorsements was accompanied by a trend toward cartoon mascots designed with a TV audience in mind; the Pillsbury Doughboy, Charlie the Tuna, and the Green Giant's raucous son Sprout were all introduced in this era.159 Such task-specific entities, born of the product they embodied and promoted, were more trac- table (and certainly livelier) than the ancient ceramics Kahluia adopted, but they lacked the authenticity Berman aimed to transfer from effigy to product. Playing his ceramic mascots two ways, Berman not only exploited the cartoonishness and malleability of the primitive but concurrently sought to capitalize on the auras of legitimacy and prestige attending the antiquity and market value of ancient artifacts.160 Taking off from the fine-print gloss that once noted, "The partying pre-Columbians are from the famed Kahluia collection" (Fig. 7), fine-print captions in ads of 1965 advised, "These authentic Pre-Columbian figures are from the famed Kahlhia collection." In 1966 that credit line was expanded to read: "These authentic Pre-Columbian figures are from the famed Kahluia collection of authentic Pre-Columbian figures" (Fig. 3). Escalating insistence on the ceramics' authenticity coex- isted with virtual erasure of their origins. Ostensibly informa- tive, Kahlua ads' fine print lays claim rather than referencing specific sources, and it conceals more than it discloses. The effigies' designation as Pre-Columbian suggests premodern manufacture in the Americas, but the assertion that they are "from" the Kahluia collection deflects attention from the actualities of their production (in Mexico, by particular groups, for inclusions in burials) and modern relocation (disinterred by looters and commodified by dealers and their patrons). The narrative of production is replaced by the narrative of the collection,'6' and the ads' glosses in fact constitute a rhetorical smokescreen that seeks to naturalize the figures' recent and radical repositionings. Doubtless unintentionally, the captions underscore the circular process at work in the Pre-Columbian campaign of 1965-70, a process whereby the brand gained cachet through association with a "famed" collection-whose very claim to fame resided in its appearances in Kahlia advertising. By no means well known in their own right (and, indeed, made especially serviceable by their lack of renown), Berman's effigies emerged "famed" in terms defined by their owner. Contrary to the suggestion of Kahlia ads' fine print, the collection was not a corporate one but remained the property of Jules Berman, who used his continuing association with Kahlua to promote his ceramics, while Kahlua used his ceramics to sell its product. Mass-market ads not only served the obvious purpose of brand promotion but also made Berman's collection well known and published, its authentic- ity repeatedly averred in print. In turn, the effigies' growing renown and putative authenticity lent luster to the brand and credence to the claim that Kahluia was a libation of ancient pedigree. Though the long-term interests of product promotion probably would have been better served by choosing and developing a single effigy as a brand icon for Kahlua (that is, a particularized personification in the mode of the Pillsbury Doughboy), that strategy would not have validated Berman's collection. Instead, dozens of Berman-owned pieces rotated in and out of brand advertising in the late 1960s. By the end of Berman's tenure with the Kahlua company, his effigies' onetime function as grave goods was as effectively buried as their usefulness in brand promotion was established. Negotiating Berman's Wake When Berman left the Kahluia organization in 1970-taking the "famed" collection with him162-a new ad team, hired from the EJL agency, also based in Los Angeles, continued to capitalize on the brand associations of Mesoamerican ceram- ics, though they lacked Berman's stable of figures and his private motivations for showcasing them. In the months following his departure, ceramics from Berman's collection occasionally turned up in ads designed by EJL,163 but (accord- ing to Berman's recollection) that practice was curtailed when Albert Stendahl, who had taken over his father's business,'64 agreed to lend figures from his inventory for use in Kahlhia promotion.165 In an apparent bid to preserve the appearance of continuity in an era of change, claims of individual figures' affiliation with the "famed Kahlhia collec- tion" appeared sporadically in brand ads through 1971, though the assemblage evoked apparently was a phantom.'66 According to Andrea Giambrone, the EJL creative director who led Kahlua's print ad campaign from 1971 to 1995, there was never any question of renouncing the brand's Pre- Columbian mascots, though the new ad team hoped to make the product more prominent than the effigies used to pitch it.'67 "Even though, when we got the account, we changed the advertising to upgrade it," she recalls, "... we kept the Pre-Columbians. They are considered sacrosanct because of the way they separate Kahlia out from every other bottle and glass."''6 Giambrone explains that EJL creatives, anxious to devise more visually and thematically unified ads for the brand, designed a series ofsingle-figure, single-drink spots-an approach that became a hallmark of the agency's work for Kahlia.169 EJL's first campaign, dubbed "The Human Comedy," comprised five single-drink ads that were compositionally consistent and thematically allied by the tag line, "Because you deserve something nice."170 Rather than ascribing speech to the Mesoamerican effigies they include, the ads tell their protagonists' "stories" in empathic second-person voice-overs that put a pitiable spin on the effigies' postures and expres- sions (Fig. 16). Having banished the multifigure mdlanges common to the Berman era, EJL also pared text and ampli- fied the "bottle and glass" component; each ad is a two-part</page><page sequence="17">750 ART BUI.LETIN DECEMBER 2000 VOI.UME I.XXXII NUMBER 4 Beause you deserve some n ce. o'too, Simply mix an ounce of Kahltia to four ounces of milk on the rocks.

(Calit ,)Oit 16 EJL Agency, "The Human Comedy: The kids have been crying," 1971 composition comprising a sorry situation (verbally sketched and effigy-embodied) and its Kahliia-based remedy (spelled out and pictured). As the eye scans from top to bottom, the pathetic scenario is pushed to the background by downstage visuals. Perspective shifts-in two senses-as the copy outlines a simple stratagem for coping, and a Kahluia cocktail, shot from above, appears almost at hand, poised on the brink of the viewer's space. Though Giambrone remarks that the figure at the center of each "Human Comedy" ad was given "star status,""171 the effigies' presence actually is diminished, since they are spoken of rather than speakers and consistently evoke characters who are acted on rather than active. The "partying pre-Columbians" of the 1960s find no counterparts in this "Human Comedy," which focuses on solitary sad sacks who find solace in Kahlia. Perhaps as a conscious corrective to the suggestion that Kahliia was a consolation prize for losers, EJL used effigies of less woebegone aspect in their next campaign, which features West Mexican twosomes rather than single figures. Each ad shows one member of a figural pair envisioning a Kahliia recipe that is both adjectivally encapsulated in boldface type and imagistically rendered in a photocollage "thought bal- loon" that springs from that figure's head. Kahlua and Milk, for instance, is positioned as a "cool" idea that calls up images of freshness (youthful imbibers in a field of daisies), Kahlua and Coffee as a "cozy" inspiration suggesting the warmth of the hearth after a walk on the beach (Fig. 17). In each instance, the ad's other figure verbally affirms the ballooned train of thought. Though communicative, the effigies of the "Thought Balloon" series are small in scale and consistently positioned in the ads' lower halves. Chorus members rather than featured players, they direct attention upward rather than claiming it. "Trying to create a little more ambience and romance around the drinks themselves," Giambrone re- marks, creatives were "not focusing any longer so specifically on what the Pre-Columbians were up to."172 She characterizes their role here as that of "little commentators ... little baby Walter Cronkites,"'73 implying that the effigies deliver stories they do not figure in themselves, "stories" suggested by specific Kahlia concoctions and "real" human characters who enjoy them in evocative locales and situations. The narrative dimensions of EJL's previous campaign-like those of many Berman-era Kahluia ads-seem to have sprung from emotions and activities suggested by particular sculp- tures' faces and postures (and, in Berman's ads, from the ways that paired or grouped effigies could play off one another). In devising the "Thought Balloon" series, however, EJL replaced that process with one that took the product itself as its point of departure: specific cocktails brought certain images and ideas to mind (what Giambrone calls "time-mood-place" associa- tions), and only when those aspects of a featured drink were established and visualized did the ad team choose a Mesoameri- can pair deemed complementary.174 Drinks-inspired collages with romantic dimensions, for instance, seemed to demand matched and heterosexual twosomes,"75 while the Black Russian-that cosmopolitan mix of dissimilar spirits-was pitched by nonresemblant male figures from two different cultures (Colima and Nayarit), their meeting of the minds confirmed by the line, "Now you're talking my language."176 In the mid-1970s, EJL creatives literally expanded on the time-mood-place idea in a series of ads in which the multiple and encapsulated images of the "Thought Balloon" ads gave way to single and unbounded "visual impressions." These are essentially still lifes, some arranged on tabletops, others laid out on the ground or floor (Fig. 18), each evoked by and evoking a specific Kahlfia drink or recipe and "suggesting a time and a mood and a place you'd have it."177 A single ceramic appears in each, and though many of these ads' effigies occupy space in ways humans might (for example, nestled into the shag carpeting), their scale within human- size surroundings marks them as sculptures, from which emanations of wit or personal drama are unexpected (and unreceived). Their wordlessness and isolation from others of their ilk (which eliminates possibilities for fictive interactions) render them decidedly less animate than the flickering flames, steaming coffee, or melting ice cream with which they share space. They seem stilled and reticent not only by lack of texted speech but also by virtue of the closed poses and blank expressions of most effigies chosen for this series-which stand in contrast to the lively, gesticulating figures that dominated Kahlia ads of the Berman era.178 According to Giambrone, the still lifes she labels "Time- Mood-Place" mark the point at which EJL's Pre-Columbian</page><page sequence="18">TIHE AFTERIIFE OF WEST MEXICAN BURIAL EFFIGIES 751 W4l"0 &amp; Coffee.

Each and every drink now certainly has the Pre- Columbian associated with it, but the anthropomorphic stuff has stopped. They're no longer commenting; they're simply associated with Kahluia. They're always there where it is; they are one and the same with it, an ongoing mnemonic."'79 Despite Giambrone's assertion, it is clear that the practice of ascribing consciousness to figural ceramics had yet to be fully eradicated from Kahlhia advertising. So long as the effigies sit on the shag or in the surf, the viewer reads them as subjects before (or instead of) relegating them to the realm of objects.'18 The "anthropomorphic stuff' to which Giam- brone refers, however, is the Berman/Marks conceit of unleashing the effigies' ostensible will to speak, which facili- tated imaginative superimposition of contemporary and local personalities, motivations, and desires on ancient and inani- mate human forms-a practice that, if producing the impres- sion of "charming whimsy," was in fact the quintessence of sophistication: a complex set of conceptual maneuvers that cleverly propagated specious assertions. While enhanced production values might suggest, at first glance, that EJL's "Time-Mood-Place" ads have more "sophistication" than Berman-era talkies, the later ads are in fact simpler and more predictable presentations of basic components: the product, a proposed manner of and ambience for usage, and a Meso- american effigy-a formula EJL recycled ad infinitum. The results are more eye-pleasing than eye-catching and corre- spond to a mass-market aesthetic Michael Schudson labels "Capitalist Realism."

F' pe r a y s 0 z: X 18 EJL Agency, "The mood: cozy," 1975 "the possibility that it is not false." Its human components are abstractions rather than individuals.' s The effigies' role changed considerably in the reign of Capitalist Realism. No longer vernacularized by familiar speech, they constitute alien notes in familiar settings and betoken stylish adventurousness (in the Vincent Price mode) rather than risible eccentricity. The altered tenor of Kahluia ads of the mid-1970s reflects more than the general staidness that settled over advertising in the recessionary economy of the United States.'82 Surely, too, changes in EJL's strategy for the brand were allied to changing perceptions and expecta- tions of the primitive, resulting from its idealization by the counterculture and youth movements of the 1960s (as a freewheeling, back-to-nature alternative to the boring imper- sonality and perceived corruption of modern technocracies) and its subsequent aestheticization and mainstreaming as a fashionable marker of liberality, open-mindedness, and en- lightened interest in ecology and the Third World.'83 Imbued with new status-notjust by intellectuals and the art world but also by designers of consumer goods-the primitive was no longer laughable-at least, not in the public forum. In this new climate, and within an ad-writing culture that was becoming increasingly attentive to the elimination of ethnic stereotypes,'8" Berman-style ads seemed crass. EJL thus dimmed the lights, softened the focus, and accentuated the newfound chic of the brand mascots they had inherited. Deborah Root might characterize this sea change as a move- ment away from the tactics of blatant appropriation to a strategy of more benign exoticism.185 If the effigies in EJL's "Time-Mood-Place" ads functioned as "mnemonics"-signposts pointing toward objects, entities, and ideas beyond themselves-it was not because, as Giam- brone asserts, they were "one and the same with" Kahlua, but rather because they referenced aspects of the product not readily grasped by its mere display: venerable Mexicanness, and an otherness amenable to the sort of lifestyle shag carpeting and coffee by the fire connote. The figures' usefulness as subtle reminders of these distinguishing charac- teristics certainly relied on viewer memories of ruder ploys; the groundwork laid by the figures' decade-long presentation as "commenting" personas rather than mute props enabled them, eventually, to signify sans text. The effigies do not need to speak, or even emote, once the consumer "knows" them and what they "have to say about Kahlua." Beginning with the "Time-Mood-Place" series, EJL operated on the assumption that long-term popular usage had effected transfer of signs from an obscure(d) system of meaning into a contemporary mass-market one, within which unconventional-looking arti- facts came to signal, by convention, the brand and its oft-rehearsed exoticism-a concept that resonated nicely in the realm of fashionable, aestheticized primitivism Kahlia ads both tapped and provisioned from the mid-1970s to early 1990s. Another Kahlrua Collection EJL's conceptual "possession" of the Mesoamerican antiqui- ties deployed in ads that bore the new ad team's stamp coincided with the actual possession that came about when agency personnel began buying Mesoamerican effigies for ad use. Having rethought the ceramics' role in brand promo- tion, the creatives may have sought the heightened sense of control that acquisition of the objects afforded (that is, collection as "form of play"/forum for play).186 It also is likely that the terms under which EJL borrowed pieces from Stendahl changed. In any event, by the mid-1970s the ad team began to spend a portion of the Kahlua advertising budget on antiquities they deemed ad-worthy.'87 By their efforts, a successor to (and pragmatist's version of) Berman's "famed Kahlia collection" was amassed in the next fifteen years. Unlike most corporate art collections, the approximately two dozen Mesoamerican ceramics Hiram Walker came to own were acquired not as investments or as image-enhancers in the abstract but as nuts and bolts of brand promotion. As such, they were selected by Giambrone and other members of her team rather than by a curator versed in Pre-Columbian art and were chosen almost solely on the basis of their potential usefulness in marketing Kahlfia. Giambrone recalls that in selecting figures for purchase, she thought of herself not as a connoisseur but instead as a casting director, in search of "the next [Pre-Columbian] Tom Cruise"-meaning, she explains, that she generally had a particular physical type in mind and set out to find it.'88 Perusal of the ad team's acquisitions hints that buyers put no great premium on authenticity (which they had little means of gauging) and did not seek a wide range of types. Giambrone confirms that the team sought ceramics</page><page sequence="20">THE AFTERLIFE OF WEST MEXICAN BURIAL EFFIGIES 753 that "looked good" to their eyes-eyes, like those of the audience to whom they pitched, that were unabashedly inexpert. The buyers' personal funds, reputations, and egos were not on the line in the way that a private collector's (let alone a curator's) would be, and the rare piece, textbook example, or ironclad provenance had little meaning or value in their workplace and product. One of the most striking features of the second Kahlhia collection is its homogeneity, a reflection of its amassers' goals. Chosen figures were meant to complement bottle and glass without overwhelming them, and the buyers' chief criterion, Giambrone says, was size-that is, the proportional relation of effigy to Kahlha bottle.'18 Figures with dimensions that fell within desired parameters then were assessed "aes- thetically"-'that is, in terms of color and texture-and eliminated if "too light or too mottled" to photograph well. (Though excessively pale figures were shunned, the ad team was drawn to ceramics with cream-colored slip, since many of the recipes they plugged were milk-based.190) Facial expres- sion and accessories, particularly accessories that were (or could be construed as) drink-related, sometimes tipped the balance toward one figure over another, though Giambrone recalls that cost was another key factor, and a significantly cheaper figure might be chosen over a more appealing but expensive one. Though Giambrone suggests she and her colleagues knew what they wanted in a Pre-Columbian figure, their purchase of some two dozen examples-more than were needed or actually used-hints at indecision or disagreement about what to buy, changes in the acquisitions agenda over time, and also, perhaps, to the creatives' pleasure in the empowerment that accompanies acquisition. Unlike Berman, the EJL team had no compelling reason to parade a multitude of figures through Kahlhia ads. Indeed, their commitment to single- drink, single-figure ads would seem to call for an opposed strategy. Had the ad team possessed broader knowledge and more confident command of the body of ceramic materials from which they made selections (or hired a consultant who did) they might have been able to settle on a core group of effigies to represent the most popular Kahlia drinks in a consistent and purposeful manner, or even to choose a single figure for development as a singular brand icon.191 It seems likely, however, that most of what EJL executives knew about Pre-Columbian art had been gleaned from Kahlfia ads.192 The second Kahlia collection clearly was amassed with an eye to the first, "famed" one-that is, to the portion of Berman's private collection that achieved renown through association with the brand. The pieces purchased by EJL creatives are village-culture ceramics of the sort Berman and Marks selected for use in brand advertising, and, with only one Veracruzano exception, they are West Mexican effigies, mainly from Nayarit.'93 Within the agency, this stable of effigies (figures of the sort Marks called "Pre-Columbians") were commonly referred to, in irreverent shorthand style, as "prekes," or even "the preke."'94 In addition to rhyming (coincidentally?) with "freak," and signaling a five-syllable label's disjunction with contemporary ad speak, this pre- ferred abbreviation carries the connotations of a diminutive, a verbal form that marks its object as small, cute, beloved, and/or familiar (that is, toylike), and, in some instances, pitiable or contemptible. The coinage and widespread use of the slighting collective nickname, "preke"-in addition to signaling obliviousness to and/or impatience with differences within difference-might be seen as a way of more fully "owning" the effigies at the ad makers' disposal, a means of labeling them tools of the trade rather than venerated artifacts. "The preke" is not a Platonic abstraction but a businessperson's way of denoting the requisite Pre-Colum- bian component of a Kahlia ad-one that semantically discounts the importance of specificity within a group of objects assembled to serve a single corporate enterprise. Absenting Presence The enhanced acquaintance with Mesoamerican art and the greater sense of mastery that must have come from examining and selecting ancient effigies for purchase seem to have had little impact on the way EJL creatives deployed them. The agency's signature Kahlia ads hold few visual signs of the casual familiarity suggested by the effigies' in-house nick- name; instead, they seem underpinned by "us/them" stand- offishness. The universalist notions that grounded Kahlhia pitches of the later 1960s (in which "they" portrayed us) were leeched away along with "the anthropomorphic stuff," and ads produced from the mid-1970s to the early 1990s affirm consumers' distance from the ancient West Mexican types Berman's team had so playfully presented as familiars. Figures from the second Kahlia collection, inserted pro forma into a long series of cocktail-centered still lifes, gradually were relegated to the position of upscale knickknacks (Fig. 19). If EJL creatives remained convinced of the wisdom-even necessity-of a Pre-Columbian presence in Kahlia's promo- tion, they clearly lacked Marks's conviction that ancient artifacts had "something interesting to say" to modern consumers. Rather than reinventing the preke for an evolving market, the ad team, confident, apparently, that the effigies' status as brand-connoting "mnemonics" was secure, their meaning consistent, focused on physical attributes like size and color rather than the figures' potential to bespeak anything other than Kahlfia. EJL's increasingly aestheticized ads conform to a genre Judith Williamson calls "absent person": still-life arrangements that portray an unseen person (or persons) whose "accessories ... point to a life-style."'95 Such ads work by inducing the viewer to enter imaginatively a temporarily vacated space, fill the shoes of its unseen denizen ("who, by his absence, is all the more like us"), and sample the rendered lifestyle and (not insignificantly) the advertised commodity that that lifestyle includes.'"6 Absent-person ads might be characterized as passive-aggressive; their superficial inertia encourages viewers' belief in their power to willfully possess and consume an image that "appears open," but actually, Williamson warns, "is only open to swallow you up."'97 Ads of this type encourage consumers to "slip into" them-as opposed to those that "enter us to mean."'18 By their very nature, they countermand the sort of human presence that Kahlia ads of the late 1960s ascribe to Meso- american ceramics. The residue of personality that clung to them beyond the Berman era made deployment of West Mexican effigies in EJL's still lifes tricky. Several of the agency's "Time-Mood- Place" ads are insufficiently vacant to function in the absent-</page><page sequence="21">754 ART BUI.I.ETIN DECEMBER 200() VOLUME IXXXII NUMBER 4 Zan .blk Ifi 19 EJL Agency, "Sssoft," 1984 person mode, "peopled" as they are by effigies of lingering presence that occupy places statues usually do not (Fig. 18). Eventually, presentation of such figures as mute mnemonics idled on shelves or tabletops (along with waning consumer memories of their former, active roles) served to muffle their once-celebrated capacity to personify, but the process of reinscribing the ceramics' lifelessness was protracted and circuitous-as evidenced by EJL's "Fantasy Backgrounds" Kahlia campaign of the 1980s. Each "Fantasy Background" ad showcases a single mixed drink. The featured Kahlfia concoction occupies front and center of a "real" still life set against a painted backdrop elaborating time, place, and mood (Figs. 19, 20).199 Unifor- mity of format serves to underscore differences of ambience from ad to ad. The scene devised for Kahlfia's White Russian presents the cocktail in surroundings of middlebrow toniness, amid pearls, silver cuff links, and a Pre-Columbian artifact (Fig. 19). The milky slip of the Chinesco-style Nayarit effigy coloristically complements the featured drink, and if read as a person, the puffy-eyed figure would seem appropriately som- nolent in this nighttime scene. Given its scale, however, and its relation to the other props, the Chinesco is readily under- stood as an objet d'art, another accoutrement of affluence in an ensemble connoting luxe. Rather than animating the scene, the effigy appears as an unseeing adjunct to the human seduction hinted at by the abandoned jewelry and nightcap. The Black Russian ad for "Fantasy Backgrounds" ("Mmmm," 1983), while lacking such narrative pretension, evokes a similarly well-heeled, if urban, lifestyle: bottle, glass, and Mesoamerican figure are positioned against a nighttime cityscape that is viewed from a lofty dwelling. The Black Russian ad's requisite effigy (the same one seen in Fig. 20) is</page><page sequence="22">THlE AFTERLIFE OF WEST MEXICAN BURIAL EFFIGIES 755 from Ixtlin del Rio. Dark brown, it seems, like the White Russian ad's pale Chinesco, to be color-keyed to the cocktail it partners. The antiquities in both ads' still lifes, displayed on tables and obliquely positioned (rather than "gazing" in the viewer's direction), read as offbeat collectibles-plausible accessories of the urbane existence Kahlua consumption implies.200 The absent persons (whom the viewer is invited to become) are people of means who, in the manner of Vincent Price, are assured enough in their own refinement to appreci- ate the occasional jolt of exoticism Kahluia and primitive art provide. These White and Black Russian ads suggest a creative decision to ally particular effigies to specific cocktails.20' The creamy tonalities, rounded forms, and mild-looking physiog- nomy of the Chinesco may be read as correlatives of the White Russian, while the rich color, sharp contrasts (of light, striated ornament against rough, brown clay), and wakeful expression of the Ixtlan del Rio figure seem keyed to the potent punch of the Black Russian's vodka/Kahluia combination. If a plan for one-to-one linkages ever existed, however, it was abandoned midway into this campaign; despite the range of figures the second Kahlhia collection offered by the mid-1980s, the five ads of "Fantasy Backgrounds" rely on a cast of only three effigies, all of them from Nayarit and two of them Chinesco- type figures with cream-colored slip.202 The effigy used in the moonlit White Russian ad, for instance, also appears in the ad for Kahlila and Cream, where it is improbably perched on a milking stool in the heartland of the United States.203 Equally odd is the double duty done by the Ixtlan effigy that moves between the modern urban aerie of the Black Russian ad and the old-fashioned soda fountain in which the Kahlua Cream Soda is displayed (Fig. 20). In the latter, despite the visual interface of the setting's striped straws and candy sticks and the striations of the figure's headdress and nose ornament, the effigy's dark, rough surface and bare-breasted primitivism are contextually dissonant. Within the domain of the adventur- ous connoisseur, this Ixtlin figure was convincingly passed off as domestic ornament reflecting bourgeois flirtation with exotica; that legitimizing conceit, however, is inoperative in the Cream Soda ad, wherein the primitive is presented in an unexpected manner and venue. This ad's noncompliance with norms governing Euro-American display of exotic arti- facts undermines (perhaps intentionally) viewer perception of the effigy's mere objectness, and allows a measure of volition and vivacity to attach to it. Playfulness is hinted, yet, since the figure alone is not communicative enough to answer questions raised by its conspicuous incongruity with its surroundings, the ad reads like a Bermanesque joke stripped of its punch line. The dark, open-mouthed figure, which faces the viewer almost squarely, does not appear to allow, much less encourage, imaginative consumption of the beverage that stands like contested ground between them. Instead (and perhaps true to form in a way EJL's ad team never suspected) the effigy comes close to reprising a possible role in the West Mexican tomb: warning off would-be intruders. Misfires like this one suggest that in their focus on good- looking ads EJL creatives grew heedless of the ways West Mexican figures could signify unbidden.

Whereas Berman and Marks were ever attentive to individual figures' powers of address, the EJL team seems to have chosen effigies on the basis of formal fits with predetermined still lifes and backdrops, assuming (perhaps rightly) that consumers were as indifferent to the preke's particularities as they were, and would neither notice nor care if, for instance, the same figure appeared with two different Kahliia cocktails. Any such assumption of the effigies' interchangeability, however, would seem to raise questions about the necessity of adding new figures to the second Kahluia collection and, more significantly, about the preke's shelf life as a mnemonic device. In the absence of a refresher course on what the preke stood for (that is, an ad campaign that revivified its image and reiterated its affinities with Kahluia), could an ad team unmoved by and/or reluctant to unleash ancient effigies' individualized communicative potential count on them to compel consumer interest and to signify predictably and productively over the course of decades? Building a Better Preke As it turned out, questions about the preke's ongoing viability as a promotional tool were raised by new management after Hiram Walker and Sons was acquired by an international conglomerate, Allied Domecq, in 1986.

Once demoted to "mnemonic" status in EJL's artful evocations of bourgeois life, West Mexican artifacts were meant to "do" nothing more than subtly signal the whiff of unconventionality Kahlua brought to the table. The process of depersonalization and marginalization initiated in EJL's "Time-Mood-Place" ads was taken to its logical conclusion in ads of the early 1990s that show West Mexican effigies lurking in shadows and soft-focus backgrounds, and finally appearing as shrunken tokens literally taken out of the picture and figuratively buried anew (Fig. 21). Taking the position that the preke's continued presence in Kahlia ads would hinge on a radical remediation of its image, Allied Domecq charged EJL with the task of breathing life into an entity creatives had worked to subdue. For years, West Mexican effigies' eccentrici- ties of proportion, expression, and toilette had been toned down by positioning, lighting, and focus and countered by the tasteful normalcy of their surroundings in Kahluia ads. In the 1980s and early 1990s, their foreignness was rarely milked for laughs, and their incongruity in many of the still lifes they occupied went unremarked-as if, by ignoring the obvious, the ad team could induce viewers to do likewise. Steele, however, felt that the preke-so clearly "funny looking"- should acknowledge its oddity by "saying or doing something fun"; otherwise, the viewer "doesn't get him." EJL's still lifes struck Steele as too stuffy to attract the youthful market share Allied Domecq sought for Kahlia, and he recalls that manage- ment wanted ads that were "young at heart" and suggestive of "fun, friends, energy."'205 The charge to recast the preke as an affable dynamo was daunting. Few of the ceramics in the second Kahlua collec- tion possess affects late twentieth-century viewers read as "friendly," and most are too stiffly posed to project the sort of "energy" brand managers desired. Stymied, the EJL team devised an alternative route they later regarded as obvious: a local prop maker was commissioned to fabricate a series of emphatically congenial figurines that combined favored fea- tures of extant ceramics with postures and expressions of enhanced fluidity and liveliness.206 Precedents for a certain amount of fakery had been established in Kahlua promotions of the 1960s, not only by expedient photomechanical manipu- lations of Berman-owned figures, but also by the collectors' decanters Altman ostensibly researched (Fig. 6). Whereas Berman, in that instance, enlisted a connoisseur's expertise to style take-offs with highbrow pretensions, EJL, targeting a different sort of consumer at Allied Domecq's behest, en- gaged Chet Zar, an artisan with mainstream credentials, to fashion deliberate vulgarizations with popular draw.207 The fakes of the 1990s, although all handcrafted, are miniatur- ized, perky, lightweight, and unbreakable-very much in the mode of mass-market trinkets.208 Rather than take this opportunity to create a singular ur-preke, EJL continued to favor multiplicity, eventually commissioning six individual figures as well as a joined heterosexual pair. Like the West Mexican figures in Rivera's Tarascan Civilization (Figs. 13, 14), the Kahlia fakes are adulterations of specific ceramics and recognized types, and as such index what was deemed appealing as well as what was not. Unlike Rivera, whose ceramists' workshop featured equal measures of masculinity and femininity, EJL favored a male preke (by a margin of seven to one) and rejected any hint of eroticism; though authentic West Mexican pieces often are explicitly gendered, the male figures commissioned by EJL are identifiable as such by their lack of breasts rather than possession of phalluses, and the lone female figure, though apparently bare-chested, has no nipples, let alone the sort of body-part-accentuating ornament and clearly delineated geni- tals West Mexico's female effigies often display. Not surpris- ingly, Rivera's notion of ancient West Mexicans as hardwork- ing manual laborers, virtually faceless in their communality, finds no parallel in the Kahlia fabrications, which suggest that male Mesoamericans' only active pursuit was warfare'29 and emphasize individuality of posture, physiognomy, and attitude. Perhaps most notable, however, are differences devolving from Rivera's and the ad makers' attitudes toward the primitive, which he sees as working its way toward civilization and they present as amusingly unaware and unconstrained by it. The seriousness of purpose apparent in Rivera's reconstruc- tions contrasts with the spirit of playful appropriation that prevails among the figures of the third Kahlia collection-an</page><page sequence="24">'rHE AFTERLIFE OF WEST MEXICAN BURIAL EFFIGIES 757 assemblage of knockoffs that may be seen as part of a larger cultural embrace of the faux in the postmodern era. Like trompe l'oeil marble, synthetic fur, and flagrantly phony costume jewelry, the artificial preke is not intended to pass as authentic; indeed, the sort of "authenticity" Rivera cherished and Berman brandished probably seemed not only irrelevant to ads meant to sell "fun" to a youthful 1990s audience but even potentially off-putting-a semantic equivalent for elitist, museological, "old." Though most of the Kahlua fabrications are based on actual West Mexican exemplars (most of them company-owned), historical accuracy was not a guiding concept. Instead, the figures produced were fun fakes that (even if assumed authentic by the inexpert) made no attempt to fool cogno- scenti. Zar notes that his assignments for Kahlua tended toward exercises in "mix and match," calling for "color like this one, a face like that one." Following what he calls "specific" directives from EJL,210 Zar made figures that resemble tourist art more closely than museum pieces. One such fabrication combines the long, broad-jawed face, rimmed eyes, crisscross headdress (and perhaps even the outstretched arms) of an Ameca-styleJalisco prototype211 with the dwarfish proportions, reddish coloration, and glossy finish of Colima (Fig. 22). Overlaying this mix of ancient aesthetics are regularizing stylization and attentiveness to cartoonish cute- ness (oversize head, pudgy, nondescript torso, flat, pawlike feet) that smack of modern popular art. While the majority of the effigies EJL executives bought for the second Kahlua collection are from Nayarit, the aesthetics of that region were avoided in the third. The distinctive look of Nayarit's Ixtlhn del Rio and San Sebastian-style effigies, with such features as tattooing, multiple nose rings, filed teeth, boxy torsos, and alternately stringy and elephantine limbs, perhaps struck corporate executives as too aberrant, and the bland-faced Chinesco effigies EJL had favored too restrained to inspire friendly feelings among target audi- ences.212 The commissioned fakes that constitute the third Kahluia collection are most reminiscent of the ceramics of Colima, which Beatriz de la Fuente characterizes as the liveliest and most dynamic and expressive of West Mexican figural styles, as well as the most elegant.213 Colima figures' burnished surfaces, incised detail, generalized bodies, and smooth, rounded forms have held great appeal for Euro- American viewers and collectors, some of whom find the raw, edgy look of Nayarit (and some Jalisco) effigies repugnant.'214 For the most part, Kahlia fakes are based on specific and singular prototypes. One Jalisco-style fabrication imitates a well-known warrior type; another mimics the head of a company-owned effigy (Fig. 23), though its projecting tongue is eliminated from the "improved" head, which rests on the bent arms of a prone and rudimentarily modeled body (Fig. 24).""25 The Colima-based pastiches EJL commissioned follow company-owned prototypes more closely-further indication that this regional style most readily conformed with what Kahlia management desired in a mascot. A Colima-style hunchback from the second Kahlia collection (Fig. 25), for instance, was only subtly altered in its miniature, ad-ready version, its once alert expression made dreamy by closed eyes and lengthened grin, its posture straightened and arms raised to embrace a bottle of Kahlia Royale Cream (Fig. 26).216 k,7 Sover ice: I/ or .I ! j ' " 1I o Irisrh -ca O-lowe h At;I t~ 22 EJL Agency, "Let things slide," 1994 Incorporating the most user-friendly aspects of the stereo- typical primitive, Zar's takeoffs are burnished, smiling, and diminutive. They enact an unthreatening otherness, the "wildness" of which resides in childlike antics. Still mute, but vivified by posture and expression, specimens from the third collection debuted in "Do a Kahlua," a campaign that portrays Kahlua drinking as an active pursuit that the ads' imperative-voice injunction urges consumers to take up. Within the limits of still photography, illusions of liveliness are effected by tilted ground planes and stop-action spills, splashes, and slides, and the preke-long sidelined-reemerges a player (Fig. 22). Laid to Rest (in the Doughboy's Dust) The preke's renaissance was brief. In 1995, brand managers imposed a temporary moratorium on print ads as they explored billboard and cable television promotions and toyed with the idea of a Claymation preke that Steele envisioned as a "Pre-Columbian Doughboy.""217 Hesitant, however, to create anotherJoe Camel (that is, an addictive substance-promoting brand mascot with youth appeal cultural critics deem inappro- priate), corporate and advertising executives still were mull- ing on the concept of a cuddly Mesoamerican liqueur huckster when results of a market survey conducted in 1996 cast a pall.

The image system from which Berman, three decades earlier, had borrowed a vision of "Sunny Mexico" was long since defunct, and consumer responses to Pre-Columbiana-even to playful takeoffs of amplified congeniality-seemingly were colored not only by primitivism's interim aestheticization (and resultant loss of risibility) but also by free-trade agreements, financial bailouts, and the economic and social challenges posed by a burgeon- ing resident alien workforce. What the average United States consumer "knew" of things Mexican, and hence brought to bear on Kahluia ads, did not enhance the brand's friendliness quotient.219 In deference, however, to Mesoamerican effigies' "histori- cal value" in brand promotion (and with an eye to the preke's possible TV future) Allied Domecq commissioned a more extensive market survey in 1997.220 To determine the preke's "relevance to today's brand strategy"'-and ultimate fate as huckster-consumers in fifteen cities were shown two ver- sions of the Kahli'a Mudslide ad: one with preke (Fig. 22), one without."22 The Jalisco/Colima composite featured there was evaluated "both monodically and in comparison to other symbols," including the Pillsbury Doughboy, Mr. Clean, and</page><page sequence="26">THE AFTERIAFE OF WEST MEXICAN BURIAL EFFIGIES 759 I T 1010 ?riii 26 Chet Zar, fabricated preke, 1995 the Michelin Tire Man, all of which were judged "more familiar icons.""' That finding is less surprising than the fact that the figure in question was held iconic enough to be evaluated as such. Traditionally, brand icons (whether in human, vegetable, or animal form) not only embody a product, but also give it personality; they are "characters"- almost always singular characters-that put recognizable faces on the products they embody. Unlike the Doughboy or Mr. Clean, "the preke" was a collective abstraction rather than a single, identifiable entity, and was neither conceived nor groomed as an icon. The Pre-Columbian effigies in EJL's still lifes were props rather than personas, their iconic potential undermined not only by marginalization but also by multiplicity. Analysts at J. Silver and Marketing Information Systems International reported, in their "Study to Evaluate Preke as Icon for Kahluia," that the preke's recognition by consumers as a brand marker for Kahlua remained "low, even with pictorial prompts," and noted that it referenced not only Mexico but also "exoticism" and "mysticism.'"223 Giambrone points out that such associations were once sought by brand managers, but analysts of recent market trends believe intima- tions of the esoteric "may limit usage."224 Though the preke was not seen as "nerdy or stodgy" (and, indeed, "enhanced feelings of sophistication" among younger consumers), the market strategist who authored the report stressed that the figures' inclusion in ads was not "conducive to descriptors of fun, popular, social, contemporary, friendly, [or] appeal- ing."225 The frolicking fakes both failed to promote such "strategic image goals" and, as EJL's ad team had long since intuited, diverted viewer attention from bottle and glass, "at the expense of product appeal." 226 Having concluded that "dropping the Preke from advertising should not have any negative consequences," since "drinkers likely will not con- sciously note its absence," analysts emphatically advised: "Preke Icon Should Not Be Utilized In Kahlza Advertising. "227 Compliance with that directive was easy, since Kahlua print ads had ceased to run, and the preke had never been readied for TV. Though the company has since returned to print advertising, Pre-Columbian Kahlhia shills, authentic or fake, are no more. Most of the commissioned fabrications are currently unaccounted for, and the effigies collected by EJL are reburied (in bubble wrap and cardboard) somewhere in Los Angeles. Primarily a scholar ofEuro-A me'can modernism, Judy Sund also is a longtime student and teacher of the art of the pre-Conquest Americas. This essay reflects the confluence of these interests in her current research project, a book-length study of twentieth-century "discoveries" of ancient West Mexican artifacts [Art Department, Queens College, City University of New York, Flushing, N.

Notes A shorter version of this essay was presented in 1998 for the Columbia University Seminar in the Arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Americas, New York, at the invitation of Esther Pasztory, and I was able to pursue a tangent of the paper in a College Art Association session chaired by Mary Vaccaro at the 1999 meeting in Los Angeles. I am deeply grateful to Professors Pasztory and Vaccaro for affirming my interest in Kahlfia's Pre-Columbian campaign, to audience members at both presentations for their observations and criticisms, and to Suzanne Fox for her insightful reading and provocative questioning of the ways in which I present this material. Three anonymous readers for the Art Bulletin made additional suggestions for the essay's improvement, as did M. Elizabeth Boone and E. Scott Gilbert. I wish to thank them all, along with Michel Besson, Eloise Quifiones Keber, and H. B. Nicholson. 1. Lumholtz, vol. 1, xvi; the author asserts that those rare groups "still ... left in their aboriginal state" should be "studied before they, too, are crushed under the heel of civilization." Clifford, who notes that "the theme of the vanishing primitive ... is pervasive in ethnographic writing," has questioned "the mode of scientific and moral authority associated with salvage, or redemptive ethnography. It is assumed the other society is 'weak' and needs to be represented by an outsider (and that what matters in its life is its past, not its present or future) "; Clifford, "On Ethnographic Allegory," in Writing Culture: The Poetics and Politics ofEthnography, ed. James Clifford and George E. Marcus (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1986), 98-121, at 112-13. See also idem, The Predicament of Culture (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1988), 200. 2. Lumholtz, vol. 1, vii. In the book's introduction, Lumholtz notes that Unknown Mexico records travels to places "never visited by tourists and ... foreign even to most Mexicans" (vol. 1, xvi). 3. The dates ascribed to West Mexican tomb goods are derived from a chart found in Townsend, 10, where they are described as "generally accepted parameters." The ceramics were preserved in shaft-chamber tombs, which abound in the so-called Tomb Arc of West Mexico and are unique to that region of Mesoamerica (though they are found throughout northern South America). Such tombs-sometimes marked at the surface by earthen plat- forms-consist of vertical shafts ranging from three to fifty feet in length and one or more lateral burial chambers (which vary in size and configuration). The most elaborate West Mexican tombs probably were reserved for the highest-ranking persons and lineages, shallower and smaller tombs for individuals of lower rank. See Clement W. Meighan, "Cultural Similarities between Western Mexico and Andean Regions," in Pre-Columbian Contact with Nuclear America, ed. J. Charles Kelley and Carroll L. Riley (Carbondale, Ill.: Southern Illinois University Museum, 1969), 11-25; Clement W. Meighan and H. B. Nicholson, "The Ceramic Mortuary Offerings of Prehistoric West Mexico: An Archaeological Perspective," in Kan et al., 17-32; and Jacki Gallagher, Companions of the Dead: Ceramic Tomb Sculpture from Ancient West Mexico (Los Angeles: Museum of Cultural History, UCLA, 1983). Phil C. Weigand has long since noted that "unimportant" West Mexicans probably were buried under their houses, as were private individuals in many other Mesoamerican cultures (Weigand, "The Ahualulco Site and the Shaft-Tomb Complex of the Etzatlin Area," in The Archaeology of West Mexico, ed. Betty Bell [Ajijic, Jalisco: West Mexican Society for Advanced Study, 1974], 120-31, at 123), and Weigand's ongoing excavations have convinced him that West Mexican shaft tombs-symbols of "sociopolitical power and prestige"-were made for only "a small element of the overall population, [and] dedicated to ceremonial events and rituals that marked the elite status of certain individu- als . . ." (Weigand and Christopher S. Beekman, "The Teuchitldn Tradition: Rise of a Statelike Society," in Townsend, 35-51, at 40-41). 4. The effigies Lumholtz acquired are in the collection of the American Museum of Natural History, New York. The culture now labeled Tarascan was centered in the modern state of Michoacin. The Tarascan kingdom (whose members called themselves and their language Pur6pecha) was a power of Mesoamerica's late Post-Classic era (that is, 1200 to 1521 C.E., the year in which the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan fell to the Spanish). Though Salvador Toscano, writing in the mid-1940s, pointed up the distinction between "Tarascan" production and the ceramics unearthed to the north of Micho- acdn, in Colima and Nayarit (Toscano, "El Arte y la Historia del Occidente en M6xico," in Arte Precolombino del Occidente de Mixico, by Toscano, Paul Kirchoff, and Daniel Rubin de la Borbolla, exh. cat., Palacio de Bellas Artes, Mexico City, 1946, 9-33), the term's popular usage as a catchall descriptor of material culture from Mesoamerica's northwestern reaches continued for some years thereafter. 5. Ixtldn, for instance, is a subculture of Nayarit, Ameca a subculture of Jalisco. 6. Despite their position at Mesoamerica's physical periphery, the cultures of West Mexico engaged in long-distance trade with more central cultures, and recent scholarship suggests that many of their practices and beliefs reflected widespread Mesoamerican traditions. See, for instance, Richard Townsend, "Before Gods, Before Kings," 107-35, and Mark Miller Graham, "The Iconography of Rulership in Ancient West Mexico," 191-215, in Townsend. 7. Lumholtz wrote, for instance, that Nayarit figures from Ixtlin ("rather grotesque in appearance") "are mainly interesting as showing the dress and ornaments of certain ancient peoples of Mexico, their mode of wearing the hair and of painting the body, their occupations, weapons, and implements, and the mode of sitting of both sexes" (vol. 2, 309). 8. Ibid., vol. 2, 292; Medioni, in M6dioni and Pinto, x. 9. Covarrubias, 90; Coe, 127. George Kubler attributed the unusual aspects of West Mexican ceramics to their makers' "protective aboriginal isolation" (118), and Kan notes that many collectors dismissed West Mexican art as "crude and grotesque" (in Kan et al., 13). 10. Rivera probably acquired the first of his many West Mexican effigies (see MAdioni and Pinto) in mid-1931, after returning from a sojourn in San Francisco and before leaving again for an extended stay in the United States in November of that year. The appearance of an effigy from Jalisco in Kahlo's Self-Portrait on the Border between the United States and Mexico, made in Detroit in 1932 (private collection, New York), indicates that she and Rivera became acquainted with West Mexican ceramics before their departure from Mexico. As Barbara Braun has remarked, information about Rivera's collecting is sketchy, in part because, as Rivera's friend Fred Fields told Braun in 1990, the acquisition of Mesoamerican antiquities was considered in Mexico "an activity on the edge of legality" (Braun 1993, 253). 11. See Holly Barnet-Sanchez, "The Necessity of Pre-Columbian Art in the United States: Appropriations and Transformations of Heritage, 1933-1945," in Boone, 177-207; and Helen Delpar, The Enormous Vogue of Things Mexican: Cultural Relations between the United States and Mexico, 1920-1935 (Tuscaloosa, Ala.: University of Alabama Press, 1992). 12. Holger Cahill, American Sources of Modern Art, exh. cat., Museum of Modern Art, New York, 1933, 9, 14. In noting that "Tarascan" sculpture was even closer to archaic than that of the "primitive" Huaxtecs, Cahill in effect labels it more primitive than primitive. He also remarks its connection to a contemporary primitive, writing that "possibly no other style has had more influence upon Mexican folk art" (14). 13. Alfonso Caso, "Pre-Spanish Art" in Museum of Modern Art, 24-25, 26. Like Cahill, Caso believed that "Tarascan" ceramics were Post-Classic in date (that is, produced in the centuries just prior to the Spaniards' arrival) and retrograde rather than truly ancient, "preserv[ing] a lively influence from the archaic" (38, my emphasis). 14. Covarrubias, 92. Though he found Nayarit production particularly raw, Covarrubias described West Mexican ceramics as generally "barbaric and powerful," "primitive and archaistic," and noted that they stood apart from other Mesoamerican art in virtually every respect (84-85). Salvador Toscano, who, like Covarrubias, collected West Mexican effigies, was likewise emphatic about West Mexico's distance from the art of Mesoamerica's most vaunted cultures: "It possesses neither the naturalism and sensuality of the Maya, nor the sober and majestic realism of the Olmecs, nor the austere geometry of the Teotihuacanos, nor the simplicity and economy of form of the Aztecs, nor, finally, the preciosity and elaborateness of the Mixtecs"; Toscano, Arte</page><page sequence="28">THE AFTERLIFE OF WEST MEXICAN BURIAL EFFIGIES 761 precolombino de Mixico y de la America Central (Mexico City: Universidad Nacional Aut6noma de M6xico, 1952), 453. 15. Since its 18th-century invention by Europeans, "primitive art" routinely has been delineated in opposition to classical "norms"; see Connelly, chap. 1, "The Sleep of Reason: 'Primitive' as the Inverse of Classicism," 11-36. 16. Their producers' illiteracy, as well as their lowbrow medium and caricatural lack of naturalism doubtless contributed to the designation of West Mexican effigies as primitive. For discussion of the factors that have routinely led Western appraisers to label objects thus, see Connelly, 15-16, 18; Errington, 74-83; and Phillips and Steiner, 6-7. The long-standing category of primitive figuration that Connelly labels the "monstrous grotesque"-a classification that encompassed both frightening and comic interpretations of human forms and physiognomies-readily accommodates West Mexican effigies, which were routinely described as grotesque and caricaturesque in their distortions (see, for example, Covarrubias, 87, 89; Keleman, vol. 1, 165; Lumholtz, vol. 2, 309; M6dioni and Pinto, x; Museum of Modern Art, 15, 26, 38); Connelly, 89, notes that in the 19th century, the terms "caricature" and "grotesque" were so closely interrelated as to be virtually interchangeable. 17. Rivera, 1942, 255. 18. See especially the murals Rivera made at the Palacio Nacional, Mexico City, between 1929 and 1951, fully reproduced in Raquel Tibor et al., Los Murales delPalacio Nacional (Mexico City: Am6rico Arte, 1997). See also Brown. 19. Rivera's West Mexican collection was published in 1941, in both Spanish- and English-language versions; see M6dioni and Pinto. The first exhibition devoted to West Mexican art, held at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City in 1946, consisted mostly of pieces owned by Rivera; see Toscano et al. (as in n. 4). Furst observes that Rivera's enthusiasm for West Mexican effigies and the wider interest it sparked accelerated the looting of West Mexican tombs (42). 20. It is difficult to decide whether Stendahl and Altman promoted West Mexican ceramics because such artifacts were easily acquired or if West Mexican pieces appeared in great numbers in Los Angeles because of the demand Stendahl and Altman created there. Vincent Price's brief portrayals of these dealers, written in the 1950s, make it clear that both Stendahl ("one of the greatest characters in the world and one of the most controversially exciting") and Altman ("the best dealer in primitive art in Los Angeles") not only sold art but also educated their clients and pointed them toward certain sorts of artifacts; Price, ILike What IKnow: A Visual Autobiography (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1959), 183, 200, 239-40.

Peter Furst began publishing on West Mexico in the mid-1960s and completed his doctoral thesis, "Shaft Tombs, Shell Trumpets and Shamanism: A Cultural-Historical Approach to Problems in West Mexican Archaeology" (UCLA), in 1966, the same year that Stanley Long completed his dissertation, "Archaeology of the Municipio of Etzatldn, Jalisco" (UCLA). 24. In 1951, Berman paid $50,000 for the right to market Kahlfia worldwide (Steele, 1). 25. My long-term, if informal, survey of those who recall the ads indicates that many viewers ascribed Kahlia's Pre-Columbian mascots to Hawaii or the South Seas rather than to Mexico. 26. James N. Wood, foreword to Townsend, 7. 27. See Braun. 1998. 28. Susan Stewart's observation that "the collection is a form of art as play, a form involving the reframing of objects within a world of attention and manipulation of context" (151) has shaped my sense of the way that those who bought West Mexican objects toyed with and imaginatively reanimated them (as in Figs. 2, 3). 29. In order to establish the ways in which West Mexican ceramics were viewed by scholars, critics, and collectors at particular points in time, I have consulted several midcentury studies (some of which, like Michael Coe's Mexico, have been revised in the decades since their first publication). I direct readers who seek more "enlightened" appraisals of West Mexican clay production to Townsend, though it should be noted that attitudes toward this body of artifacts have remained fairly consistent in some quarters. In 1992, for instance, Beatriz de la Fuente wrote that the "crude forms and clumsy manufacture" of Nayarit figuration "recall the most primitive stirrings of Western art," and described an effigy from Jalisco as "just barely this side of deformation and caricature" (Fuente, "The Spirit behind the Stone," Artes de Mexico, no. 17 [Autumn 1992]: 90). In an essay published the following year, Michael Coe (as in n. 20) dismissed "West Mexican tomb sculpture" as "charming but lightweight art" (280). 30. Raymond Williams called advertising "the official art of capitalist society" (Williams, "Advertising: The Magic System" [1961], in The Cultural Studies Reader; ed. Simon During [London: Routledge, 1993], 334), and Marchand remarks that ads shape a "community of discourse"--an integra- tive common language shared by an otherwise diverse audience (xx). See also Mason Griff, "Advertising: The Central Institution of Mass Society," Diogenes 68 (Winter 1969): 120-37; andJames B. Twitchell, Adcult USA: The Triumph of Advertising in American Culture (New York: Columbia University Press, 1996), 1-9. 31. Marchand, xviii (his emphasis); Schudson, 233. 32. Unlike radio and television commercials, print ads are literally marginal- ized, positioned at the periphery of more privileged texts. 33. Marchand, xx; see also Schudson, 3-4, 226-27; and Mady Schutzman, The Real Thing: Performance, Hysteria and Advertising (Hanover, N.H.: Wesleyan University Press and University Press of New England, 1999), 12. 34. William M. O'Barr-having noted that "the meaning of advertisements is actually a joint collaborative effort on the parts of the maker and the consumer"-asserts that "advertisements work ... only when the meaning is [the consumer's] own"; O'Barr, Culture and the Ad: Exploring Otherness in the World of Advertising (Boulder, Col.: Westview Press, 1994), 8. Robin Andersen, however, insists on the difference between what she calls "the associative work of art" and the advertisement. The ad, Andersen writes, "never leaves questions open to be resolved by the self but, rather, forces meanings to close around the product.... In the end there exist no gaps in significance, no questions left unanswered"; Andersen, Consumer Culture and TVProgramming (Boulder, Col.: Westview Press, 1995), 103. While T.J.Jackson Lears notes that "after the recovery of Mikhail Bahktin's 'dialogical' criticism and the popularization of reception theory" few "would deny consumers a place alongside producers in the process of constructing cultural meanings," he also reminds us that "reception theory involves a recognition that the text imposes limits on the audience as well as creating opportunities for amateur hermeneutics"; Jackson Lears, "Making Fun of Popular Culture," American Historical Review 97, no. 3 (Dec. 1992): 1417, 1421. 35. As Baudrillard (164-96) observes, advertising is more indicative than imperative, "the clear expression of a culture" (166, his emphases). The "hypodermic needle" theory of advertising's powerful effects on an unsuspect- ing public (championed by Vance Packard in The Hidden Persuaders, 1957) has few contemporary adherents. Those who study the dynamic between ads and consumers are more inclined to characterize it as a give-and-take process in which consumers' takes on ad makers' offerings are variable, unpredictable, and difficult to determine. See Baudrillard, 165; Marchand, viii; and Schud- son, 15. 36. Marchand, xx. See also Schudson, who, though convinced of the limited nature of "advertising's specific power to sell specific goods," acknowledges "advertising's general impact as an art form and a symbolic system" and its "general role in shaping consciousness and providing a framework for thought and feeling" (43). 37. In her well-known study of the way ads work, Judith Williamson observes that new products, lacking meaning for the consumer, are given value by their alliances with people or objects that "already mean." Rather than disseminat- ing new information, most advertising transfers ideas and attitudes attached to signs out of other meaning systems onto the unfamiliar commodity by association (30-31). Because of its focus on print ads made in the era of the Kahlfia Pre-Columbian campaign, Williamson's work has been particularly useful to me. 38. Price collected both Western and non-Western art of many eras. See The Art Collection of Vincent and Mary Price, exh. cat., Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery, 1958; and Raul A. Lopez and Alan Curl, eds., Vincent Price: Actor and Art Collector (Riverside, Calif.: Riverside Museum Press, 1982). 39. Price's I Like What I Know, referenced in the Kahlia ad that bears his endorsement, details his adventures in collecting. It seems likely that Price hoped to generate publicity for this recently published autobiography (1959; as in n. 20) by endorsing Kahlfia in a national product launch. 40. Though Berman (who died in July 1998 at age eighty-seven) provided brief answers to questions I posed about his involvement with Kahlfa, he declined to be interviewed about his collecting practices; for anecdotal accounts of the way his collection was shaped, see Marks; and Valerie G. Frizzell, introduction to Pahl and Stern, n.p. Berman did note that he had sold off a good deal of his collection some years earlier. 41. The voice of the unknown entrepreneur clearly lacked the authority conferred by Price's celebrity and magisterial screen persona-valuable commodities that served Berman's product and growing collection. 42. Though Kahlia has long been manufactured in Mexico (from cane spirits and Mexican coffee beans), the formula is believed to have originated in North Africa, and its name may be Arabic in origin (Steele, 1). Early Kahlia labels showed a man in a turban seated beneath a horseshoe arch, and though this figure was replaced by a stereotypical "sleeping Mexican" in the late 1960s, the architecture pictured in the bottle art remains Moorish. 43. For the collection of exotica as a narrative of mastery, see Stewart, 146, 148; for the "snob" appeal of exotic artifacts, see Nelson Graburn, Ethnic and Tourist Arts (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1979), 2-3. 44. The humorous thrust of Kahlia ads in the 1960s was in keeping with a larger trend in advertising in the United States that was initiated by the agency Doyle Dane Bernbach (DDB) in the Volkswagen campaign launched in 1959. The droll and self-effacing voice ofVW ads (for example, "It's ugly but it gets you there") sparked widespread emulation. The pretentious tone and formulaic pitches common to ads of the 1950s lost ground to plainspoken ones that aimed to amuse consumers of the 1960s, whom Juliann Sivulka describes as "younger, better educated, more mobile" and "in search of novelty and opportunities for individual expression" (290, 304). See also Schudson, who notes advertisers' adherence to "product-bound" conventions and speculates that the smallness and foreignness of the Volkswagen both allowed and encouraged DDB to promote it with self-parodying humor, which might not have worked for a more mainstream automobile (75-76); the same</page><page sequence="29">762 ART BULLETIN DECEMBER 2000 VOLUME LXXXII NUMBER 4 might be said of Kahlfia's campaign vis-a'-vis those of better-known, Old World liqueurs. 45. Reiner played second banana to Sid Caesar throughout the 1950s, first on Your Show of Shows and then on its successor, Caesar's Hour 46. Steele writes that the marketing group Berman assembled after acquir- ing the brand devised the Black Russian in the conviction that "significant [consumption] could be obtained by repositioning Kahlfia as an ingredient in a mixed drink rather than just a sipping liqueur." After successfully launching that cocktail on premises to bar owners and patrons as part of a national product launch, the Kahlfia sales team continued to formulate mixed drinks that included the liqueur (1). 47. Grayco was married to entertainer Spike Jones, who often is mentioned in ads that feature her. 48. Steele, 1. 49. In the ad "Kahlfia: The eighth lively art," 1961. 50.

More recently, the Kahlhia company has experimented with special- edition glass bottles that are loosely based on Pre-Columbian figural sculp- tures. Though discontinued in the United States, where market research revealed consumers suspected that oddly-shaped bottles held less liqueur than standard-issue ones (Brandon Steele, personal communication with author, 1998), the effigy-inspired bottles continue to be sold in Mexico. 54. In 1962, a holiday ad showed a Monte Alban incensario (possibly from Berman's collection) festooned with streamers ("Fiesta!"), and Berman's team produced a Kahlfia and cognac promotion that featured a tourist-art version of the famed Aztec "calendar stone," whose diminutive size, altered motifs, and colorization mark it as a takeoff rather than a replica ("Amigos"). 55. Price (107) writes of the process by which primitive art becomes pedigreed, even "authenticated," by association with known collectors and collections, their makers upstaged by their Western owners as such "pedigrees replace the artist's signature." 56. In its carnivalesque display of otherness in the service of a supposedly ancient elixir, this ad echoes patent medicine promotions of the later 19th century, an era in which great numbers of over-the-counter remedies claimed primitive, tribal origins that registered with consumers as both natural and somewhat magical. T. J. Jackson Lears writes that ads of this genre tapped a construction he calls "imperial primitivism": "The white man enters the dark interior of a tropical land, extracts mysterious remedies, and puts them at the service of Anglo-Saxon civilization"; Jackson Lears, Fables of Abundance: A Cultural History ofAdvertising in America (New York: Basic Books, 1994), 146. 57. Marks, 3. 58. Frizzell (as in n. 40), n.p. Sheldon Marks's firm oversaw the production of the catalogue for which Frizzell wrote, and her indebtedness to him is clear when her 1973 assessment of Berman's collection is compared with Marks's remarks of 1968: "The Jules Berman Collection is especially noted for its emphasis on the warmth and good humor inherent in the Pre-Hispanic figurines.... The discovery that they portray true-to-life attitudes and situa- tions was of especial interest to Mr. Berman" (Frizzell); "The Jules Berman Collection (perhaps better known to the general public as the Kahlfia Collection) is especially notable for having pointed up the warmth, interest and good humor inherent in the Pre-Hispanic figures.... The discovery that the figures portray true-to-life attitudes and situations was made quite inadvertently" (Marks, 3). 59. The recipe cannot be linked to Mesoamerican antiquity, since the indigenous peoples of Mexico made no distilled spirits. 60. Carl Sandberg, prologue to The Family of Man, exh. cat., Museum of Modern Art, New York, 1955, 2, quoted in Price, 26. Further evidence of the midcentury popularity of what Price calls the "universality principle" (see her chap. 2, 23-36) could be found in exhibits at the New York World's Fair of 1964-65; enthusiasm for the notion was perhaps most extravagantly displayed in the Disney-designed, Pepsi-sponsored tribute to UNICEF, "It's a Small World" (which lives on at Disneyland in Anaheim, California, where it was reconstructed after the fair closed). See Singleton, vol. 2, 526. 61. Though both ILove Lucy (180 episodes, 1951-57) and The Honeymooners (39 episodes, 1955-56) were shot in the 1950s, both were seen in reruns throughout the 1960s. See Vince Waldron, Classic Sitcoms: A Celebration of the Best in Prime-Time Comedy (Beverly Hills: Silman-James, 1987). 62. The characters enacted by Berman's West Mexican effigies may have tapped, on some level, consumers' familiarity with two Latino stereotypes popularized by movies and television, entities Charles Ramirez Berg labels "The Male Buffoon" and "The Female Clown." These risible types (less threatening to Anglos, Berg observes, than those he identifies as the "bandito," "latin lover," "harlot," and "dark lady") are epitomized by ILove Lucy's Ricky Ricardo and by the Latinas enacted by Lupe VWlez (the "Mexican Spitfire") and Carmen Miranda (the "Lady in the Tutti-Frutti Hat"). As described by Berg, the Latino buffoon displays "simple mindedness" and "childish regressions into emotionality" (cf. Figs. 8, 9) that neutralize more disturbing facets of his otherness (such as sexual allure). The potential eroticism of his female counterpart is derailed by her dizzy antics and often outlandish toilette, and Berg notes her tendency toward "emotionalism" and "inability to restrain her baser instincts" (cf. Fig. 10). The names and monologues given effigies in Kahlfia ads, however, do not reference Latino culture or speech, and it would seem that the ads' humor is not overtly ethnic but instead relies mainly on disjunctions between the ads' (oddly exotic) visual and (thoroughly domesticated) verbal components. Berg, "Stereotyping in Films in General and of the Hispanic in Particular," in Latin Looks: Images of Latinos and Latinas in the U.S. Media, ed. Clara E. Rodriguez (Boulder, Col.: Westview Press, 1997), 112-17. 63. In ancient Mesoamerica, conch shells were associated with rulership, and conch trumpets were used to signal important events; see Mark Miller Graham (as in n. 6). The conch blower of this ad was photographically altered; the effigy's right hand, which actually is empty (cf. Pahl and Stern, no. 17), was here endowed with a concave ovoid suggesting the lid of the "coffee pot," its form apparently suggested by a projecting element on the figure's headdress. This ad promotes Hiram Walker's trademarked brandy and Kahlfia mix, K&amp;B. 64. Honeymoonerprotagonist Ralph Kramden (played byJackie Gleason) was well known for his threats of physical violence against his wife, Alice. He often warned, "One of these days, Alice ... Pow, right in the kisser!" First seen on Gleason's variety show Cavalcade of Stars, the "Honeymooner" skits were later developed as a series of half-hour episodes aired in 1955-56. On the occasion of that series' debut, TV Guide ran an article headlined "One of These Days, Alice..." in which psychiatrists offered explanations for audience fascination with Ralph's proclivity for violence, already established in the skits seen on Cavalcade; Frank De Blois, TV Guide, Oct. 1, 1955; reprinted in Donna McCrohan, The Honeymooners' Companion (New York: Workman, 1978), 76-77. "Honeymooner" skits were part of the mix of sketches included in the eponymous variety show that succeeded Gleason's Cavalcade of Stars (it ran through 1970). Half-hour episodes made in the mid-1950s continue to be seen in syndication; in 1966, Joe McCarthy celebrated their seemingly endless rebroadcasting ("week in and week out, winter and summer, for the last nine years") in an article that began, "Alice, so help me, one of these days-pow! Right on the kisser!"; McCarthy, Life, Mar. 25, 1966; reprinted in McCrohan, 42-43. 65. Such "marriage pairs" (see Townsend, nos. 112, 129, 137, 142, 146, 148, 149, 191, 192, 193, 195), whom Covarrubias (90) characterized as "bored and melancholy lovers" were probably meant to suggest regeneration in their original burial contexts; some of the female effigies appear to be pregnant (for example, Townsend, 123, no. 201), others breast-feed infants (for example, Townsend, 42, no. 191). 66. The male figure is approximately twelve inches tall, to the female's nine. The protrusions on both figures' shoulders--often referred to as shoulder knobs-are especially common to figures from Jalisco. Long surmised to represent purposeful scarification, they have more recently been interpreted as applied ornament of some sort, possibly shell beads (Kan et al., 109, no. 69). 67. Williamson (164) holds that ads "can use any material at all, however hostile its content may appear to be to their own methods and aims," if they are able to win the complicity of their audience, whom Williamson calls "the culminating point of misrepresentation." 68. Many sitcoms of the era featured supernaturals who passed as human among their (sometimes suspicious) suburban neighbors. In My Favorite Martian (1963-66), an alien with retractable antennae masqueraded as an eccentric Earthling after crashing his spaceship in Los Angeles. The long- running Bewitched (1964-72) built comedy situations around a beautiful witch's attempts to curb her powers and refashion herself as a "normal" housewife; similarly, I Dream of Jeannie (1965-70) featured a comely female genie who became the domestic slave of the astronaut "master" who retrieved her from a desert island and installed her in his Florida home. 69. David Marc labels sitcoms in which abnormal entities (witch, Martian, talking horse) mingle with regular folks "Magicoms," and he remarks that they constitute "the most prolific sitcom subgenre and arguably the most popular type of program on all of American television during the sixties"; Marc, Comic Visions: Television Comedy and American Culture (Malden, Mass.: Blackwell, 1989), 107. 70. In response to a decade of widespread UFO sightings by citizens of the United States (including over a thousand such reports in 1966 alone), the Air Force commissioned a task force based at the University of Colorado to undertake a study of the phenomenon in Oct. 1966; the resultant report (issued in Dec. 1968) held that no compelling evidence existed of UFOs' extraterrestrial origins. See Singleton, vol. 3, 742-44. 71. When this ad appeared, My Favorite Martian (see n. 68 above) had just finished a three-year run. 72. When the Black Russian was christened in the 1950s, Berman and Associates could not have anticipated the charged meaning "black" would take on in the mid-1960s, as "black power" became a slogan of racial solidarity and African-American activism (summer 1966), the Black Panthers organized (Oct. 1966), and "Black is beautiful" became a much-uttered affirmation. See Singleton, vol. 1, 94; and Neil A. Hamilton, TheABC-Clio Companion to the 1960s Counter-Culture in America (Santa Barbara, Calif.: ABC-Clio, 1997), 32. 73. Kahlia ads like "Out of this world" recall a traditional use of freakish entities in Western cultures: "On display," Susan Stewart writes, "the freak represents the naming of the frontier and the assurance that the wilderness, the outside, is now territory" (110). 74. See Hamilton (as in n. 72), 35. 75. Marks, 3.</page><page sequence="30">THE AFTERLIFE OF WEST MEXICAN BURIAL EFFIGIES 763 76. Marianna Torgovnick's observation that "the primitive ... is our ventriloquist's dummy--or so we like to think" seems a particularly pertinent commentary on Marks's contrived account of the process by which Berman's effigies came to "talk." See Torgovnick, Gone Primitive: Savage Intellects, Modern Lives (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1990), 9. 77. In Shearer West, ed., The Bullfinch Guide to Art History (Boston: Little, Brown, 1996), "Pre-Columbian" is characterized as a "catch-all term that refers to the native arts of the Americas-North, South, Meso, as well as the West Indies--before the arrival of Columbus in 1492 and subsequent Euro- pean invasion" (724). 78. Michel Leiris has written that Westerners "are less able to appreciate the respects in which cultures or things unfamiliar to us differ from one another than they differ from those to which we are used" and notes that "we tend to see a certain resemblance between them, which lies, in point of fact, merely in their common differentness"; Leiris, "The African Negroes and the Arts of Carving and Sculpture," in Interrelations of Cultures (Westport, Conn.: UNESCO, 1953), 35. 79. In his discussion of the "American Indian" as an abstraction that served the notion of Manifest Destiny, W.Jackson Rushing describes "The Indian" as "an actor without subjectivity, whose perceived identity was manufactured by the verbal and visual discourses of explorers, priests, politicians, soldiers, and, not least of all, social scientists and artists," and notes that this "figurative Indian may be likened to a signifier without a signified." See Rushing, "The Idea of the Indian/Collecting Native America," in Native American Art and the New York Avant-Garde: A History of Cultural Primitivism (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1995), 1. Rushing's remarks on the tactical employment of cultural generalizations inform my understanding of Marks's and Berman's appropriation of Mesoamerican ceramics for Kahlfia's promotion. 80. Williamson (164) remarks that "far from creating ideas or meanings, advertisements actually remove all meaning from objects and events in terms of material context and content, thus leaving gaps which can be filled by the product." 81. I have found one exception to this rule: a Black Russian ad produced in 1976 that features a Teotihuacan-style effigy. 82. Coe (128) has linked the ceramic production of these regions, noting that ancient West Mexico may be seen as "the western counterpart of the Remojadas culture of Veracruz" by virtue of its lively and humorous clay art (though he notes that West Mexico differs from Veracruz in its absence of mold-made pottery). 83.

Peter Furst's radical reassessment of the thematics of West Mexican effigies within the context of modern shamanic practice (for example, "West Mexican Tomb Sculpture as Evidence for Shamanism in Prehispanic America," Antropol6gica 15 [1965]: 29-80, or "West Mexican Art: Secular or Sacred?" in The Iconography of Middle American Sculpture [New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1973], 98-133) sparked more attentive examination of the ceramics' content in the last three decades of the 20th century; see especially Hasso van Winning, The Shaft Tomb Figures of West Mexico (Los Angeles: Southwest Museum, 1974); Gallagher (as in n. 3); Kan et al.; and Townsend, pt. 2, "Interpreting the Tomb Sculptures of Ancient West Mexico," 89-203. Scholars of Mesoamerica now recognize West Mexican ceramics' myriad references to ritual and rulership as well as to village life. 87. Williamson (164) describes a process by which "a cultural moment is emptied of its real meaning ... and totally taken over by the product.... Reality is not described or explained, but referred to in such a way as to make it mean something exterior to itself." 88. For a discussion of the interconnectedness of eclecticism and interna- tional trade, seeJames H. Bunn, "The Aesthetics of British Mercantilism," New Literary History 11 (Winter 1980): 303-21. Bunn observes that the disruption of cultural signs from their referent environments is one by-product of mobile exchange (319). 89. See Price, 56-67, 100-107. 90. Torgovnick (as in n. 76), 9. 91. My examination of sixty-seven Kahlfia ads produced between 1963 and 1992 showed that 78 percent (fifty-two ads) used West Mexican figures only; 15 percent (ten ads) used West Mexican figures in combination with Veracruz figures; and 6 percent (four ads) used only Veracruz ceramics. The ad mentioned in n. 81 above constituted a singular usage of a Teotihuacan-style piece. 92. A Kahlia and Coffee ad that featured a "smiling face" figure thigh-deep in snow was the last Kahlia ad to use a Veracruz figure. It ran in 1979 and 1980 and featured a painted rather than photographic reproduction of the figure. 93. Covarrubias, 87. 94. Keleman, vol. 1, 165. 95.

John and GordonJavna cite an unnamed critic's observation that "newly affluent Americans, bewildered by the technological sixties, see themselves as bumbling hillbillies lost in the suburbs.... Hillbilly jokes release tensions about class, education, and status" (Javna and Javna, 60s! [New York: St. Martin's Press, 1988], 48). David Farber makes much the same argument in retrospect, suggesting that the great popularity of The Beverly Hillbillies, a "seemingly banal spoof," may have been indebted to nouveau suburbanites' identification with a narrative of uprooting and relocation to a new commu- nity where social gaffes loom as initiates work to master an unfamiliar lifestyle. (Farber notes that the very notion of a "lifestyle" was recent; the term first appeared in Webster's International Dictionary in 1961.) See Farber, TheAge of Great Dreams: America in the 1960s (New York: Hill and Wang, 1994), 52-55. As Farber also observes, "The car one drove, the cigarettes smoked, the TV shows watched, the products consumed became a common language signaling who one was and wanted to be" (11); Kahlfia ads encouraged such aspiring sophisticates to perform their savoir faire by imbibing and offering after- dinner liqueur or basting the chicken with an exotic elixir. 98. M6dioni, in M6dioni and Pinto, vii, x. 99. M6dioni's essay accompanies dozens of photos by Marie-Th6rbse Pinto. This watershed volume (which also appeared in a Spanish-language edition) constituted the first substantive presentation of West Mexican clay art, which Rivera had been collecting for about a decade. 100. M6dioni, in M6dioni and Pinto, x. 101. Campesinos was a favorite Rivera buzzword for the rural proletariat, be they Russian or Mexican. He once described campesino production as "an art based in the earth; in its colors, in its materials, and in its power it is perfectly adapted to the medium from which it rose" (Rivera, "El espiritu revoluciona- rio en el arte moderno," Modern Quarterly, 1932; reprinted in Moyssen, 159-71, 165). In an essay published in Worker's Age in 1933, Rivera noted: "It is indisputable that all art must have deep roots in the soil on which it is made, and that the only artistic production on this continent that has such roots is Amerindian campesino art, which has as brilliant and magnificent a tradition as Egyptian or Greco-Roman art. This tradition was never interrupted. It continued to live, especially in Mexico" (reprinted in Moyssen, 191). Else- where, Rivera noted that the terra-cotta art of Colima and Nayarit reflected "aspects of life in their epoch" (quoted in Alfredo Cardona Pefia, El Monstruo en su Laberinto [Mexico City: Ediciones Diana, 1980], 83), but still, "thousands of years after their manufacture," remained fresh, vital, and much more "modern," in his opinion, than "whichever new Parisian product" (Rivera, 1942, 255). 102. See Rivera, "Antonio Ruiz" (1942), in Moyssen, 250-51. 103. Furst (42) relates Rivera's "political orientation" to his enthusiasm for West Mexican ceramics. See also Braun 1993, 264. 104. Rivera claimed to have begun collecting antiquities as a child in Mexico City and once told Gladys March that "the pre-Conquest art of Mexico, for which I conceived a passion that was to influence my entire artistic life," "sustained" him as an adolescent art student (Rivera, 1960, 39). He probably did not begin collecting antiquities in earnest and in quantity, however, until mid-1931, after his return from a successful sojourn in San Francisco that made him more prosperous than ever before. It was in the second half of 1931 that the artist, using money earned in San Francisco, initiated construction of the adjoining studios Juan O'Gorman designed for him and Frida Kahlo in San Angel, and he may well have bought his first West Mexican ceramics (which only recently had become available in Mexico City) with some of the same monies. See n. 10 above. 105. Whereas Braun suggests that for his collection Rivera consciously eschewed the "large monuments ... and the sumptuary items ... associated with the pre-Hispanic elite," and did so with the intention of indicting the "capitalist values" expressed in the collections of norteamericanos like Robert Woods Bliss or Nelson Rockefeller (Braun, 1993, 264), it seems more plausible that Rivera was unable or unwilling to pay the prices elite production garnered in the 1930s and 1940s. 106.

In addition to listing physical types he finds amusing (such as the fat, deformed, and misshapen), Midioni suggests a satirical edge in the effigies' "rather disturbing joviality." While some West Mexican figures, for instance, "banter the big-bellied bourgeois, personages occupying important positions, all swollen with their dignity and functions," others show rather ineffectual- looking warriors, "all adorned with plumes and entangled in their weapons," who throw their enemies looks that Midioni finds "more sly than frightening" (M(dioni and Pinto, x). Like M~dioni, Alfonso Caso (as in n. 13) and Rivera's fellow collectors Salvador Toscano (as in nn. 4 and 14) and Miguel Covarru- bias wrote of the effigies' "caricaturesque" quirks. 109. See the statements of Lupe Marin and Frida Kahlo that are appended to Rivera's autobiography My Life, My Art (Rivera, 1960, 185-88). 110. See Kenneth E. Silver, Esprit de Corps: Art of the Parisian Avant-Garde and theFirst World War 1914-1925 (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1989). 111. Rivera was convinced of the visual arts' ability and responsibility to acquaint broad and diverse audiences with viewpoints that might otherwise be inaccessible; in an essay of 1932, he wrote, "Art has the advantage of speaking</page><page sequence="31">764 ART BULLETIN DECEMBER 2000 VOLUME LXXXII NUMBER 4 an idiom that is easily understood by workers and campesinos everywhere. ... It doesn't need a translator"; Rivera, 1932 (as in n. 101), 162. 112. Rivera's modernist primitivism is comparable to the deliberate archa- ism of 19th-century groups ranging from the Nazarenes and Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood to the Nabis and school of Pont-Aven. It conforms (as do Byzantine mosaics and the work of Italian primitives) to a primitive Connelly calls "ornamental" and describes as a balancing of mimesis with pattern, unmodulated color, and linear rhythms (56-57). 113. In the conviction that "every art needs to have deep roots in the soil on which it is produced" and that "the unique artistic production of this continent is rustic American Indian art," Rivera often argued that any truly American art would take Indian art as a base; see Rivera, 1933 (as in n. 101), 191. In his opinion, however, the murals of the Italian primitives accorded well with the painting styles of Pre-Columbian Mexico; see Rivera, 1942, 260. 114. Rivera's appropriations of pre-Hispanic Mexican art are detailed by Brown. See also Braun (as in n. 107), "Diego Rivera: Heritage and Politics," 186-249; and Braun, 1998, 268-72. 115. See Raquel Tibor, Frida Kahlo: An Open Life (Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 1983), 158. Though Tibor reports that many of the pre-Hispanic figures once displayed in Kahlo's home, La Casa Azul, were delivered to Rivera's museum, Anahuacalli, after Kahlo's death in 1954, a wealth of West Mexican ceramics remains on view there; one particularly impressive grouping adorns the multitiered mantelpiece of the house's main room. 116. Brown, 155. 117. Rivera, 1960, 19, 31. 118. See Rivera, "De la libreta de apuntes de un pintor mexicano," Arts, Jan. 1925; reprinted in Moyssen, 71-77. 119. Rivera's recorded remarks in "La pintura mexicana" suggest he may have believed that some of the West Mexican effigies he considered "Ta- rascan" were merely "primitive," while those from "the tombs of Nayarit" were among the "oldest in Mexico and in all America" (Rivera, 1942, 255); certainly, a better sense of the chronology of West Mexican artifacts was emerging in the 1940s, as Toscano's essay of 1946 makes clear (see n. 4 above). 120. Covarrubias, 89. 121. Structures with roofs like those seen in Rivera's fresco, though no longer extant in West Mexico, are documented by the small-scale terra-cotta tableaux of village life produced in abundance in ancient Nayarit (see Townsend, 92-95, 98; nos. 172-76). Rivera's interest in this indigenous architecture is likewise indicated in the Nayarit-inspired roof that shades a stone temple platform Rivera added to the garden of Kahlo's family home (and his sometime residence), La Casa Azul; a photograph of the structure appears in Martha Zamora, Frida Kahlo: The Brush of Anguish (San Francisco: Chronicle Books, 1990), 75. 122. The male figure's conical headdress, nose rings and earrings, arm bands, and tattooed (or painted) face and body are typical of Nayarit effigies, as is the twisted headdress of the female figure who stands beside him. The tall headdress is most commonly worn by men; the twisted one is worn by both sexes. 123. Infants in West Mexican sculpture are not shown wrapped, and-as Brown notes (149)-painted manuscripts of the sort held by the male figure were unknown in the place and era of the ceramics' manufacture. Rivera, however, may have meant to suggest continuity in Mexico's far west, with styles of tattooing and jewelry seen in Nayarit figuration maintained by later generations of the "Tarascan Civilization" his mural seeks to evoke. 124. In the middle ground (framed by the heads of the tattooed foreground figures), is a figure carrying a bale with a forehead tumpline of the sort seen in some of the Colima sculptures Rivera owned. As Braun notes (1998, 270), however, Rivera's collection also contained several Aztec representations of porters carrying heavy loads in the same, obviously traditional, manner. 125. Covarrubias, 90. 126. The other two grisaille panels show (at left) the manufacture of conch-shell trumpets and (at right) a West Mexican dye works and the art of ornamenting the body. 127. The male ceramist's facial structure and lack of ornament belie his ostensibly "Tarascan" identity. 128. Nudity-particularly the sort of genital display that one finds in some West Mexican effigies-is unusual in most Mesoamerican visual culture, in which female figures (especially those seen in the figural art of "high" civilizations) typically are draped, and an exposed phallus often connotes defeat and humiliation rather than powerful virility. 129. Covarrubias notes that "life-size hollow effigies of dogs" are the "best known" Colima statues and, allowing that the "range in Colima sculpture is enormous," specifically mentions "bundle carriers" of the sort seen here (92), which Rivera often referenced (see n. 124 above). 130. Dawn Ades remarks that Rivera's appreciation of Pre-Columbian artifacts-like his enthusiasm for Mexican popular arts-"remains at the level of aesthetic and intellectual admiration" and observes, "It could be argued that his art never really assimilated" the material culture he collected in bulk; Ades, Art in Latin America (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1989), 206, 210. 131. Rivera 1942, 262. 132. In 1942, Rivera lamented the substitution of modern, "hygienic" materials for traditional ones in the manufacture of furniture, toys, and other Mexican handcrafts and disparaged the bourgeois trade in Mexican popular arts, not only in Mexican "curio shops" but also in American department stores (Rivera, 1942, 262-63). Rivera's concerns are paralleled in numerous cultural critiques of his era; see Clifford, 1986 (as in n. 1), 112-13. More recently, Phillips and Steiner note the gradual merger of the "art-artifact- commodity triad" into "a single domain" (16). Notable, in light of Rivera's later acquisitions and practices of display, is the artist's baleful description, in 1925, of the processes whereby intellectuals take up "arte popular," village dwellers embrace cheap manufactured goods, aesthetes engage in futile efforts to repurify ever-changing popular production, and the bourgeois make "art objects" of the things villagers once used (Rivera, "Los retablos: Verdadera actual y unica expresi6n pict6ria del pueblo mexicano," Mexican Folkways, 1925; reprinted in Moyssen, 90-91). 133. Authenticity, like the primitive, is defined against its opposite; as Stewart observes (140), "The location of authenticity becomes whatever is distant to the present time and space.... The antique as souvenir always bears the burden of nostalgia for experience impossibly distant in time." 134. Virginia Dominguez, "The Marketing of Heritage," American Ethnolo- gist 13, no. 3 (Aug. 1986): 546-55. Rivera would seem to shed light on his own (later) display of indigenous culture in the brief profile of Carolina Durieux he wrote in 1924; there, he asserted that the true Mexicanness of the objects in Durieux's home "shows her profound knowledge of and great love for this country" (Rivera, "La obra de Carolina Durieux," American Folkways, 1924; reprinted in Moyssen, 62). 135. In "La pintura mexicana," Rivera mentions '"juguetes antropomorfos y zoomorfos de las tumbas de Nayarit" (Rivera, 1942, 255); and Baudrillard, 75 n. See also Stewart, who observes, "The authenticity of the exotic object arises not in the conditions authored by the primitive culture itself but from the analogy between the primitive/exotic object and the origin of the possessor, the authentic 'nature' of that radical otherness which is the possessor's own childhood" (146). 136. For details, see Hayden Herrera, Frida: A Biography ofFrida Kahlo (New York: Harper and Row, 1983). 137. Kahlo's emphatically unplucked eyebrows and hairy upper lip, her adoption of male attire and, on occasion, boyish haircuts, were visual markers of the mannish womanhood she provocatively enacted. Kahlo's display of her wounds (as in Remembrance of an Open Wound [1938, destroyed] and The Broken Column [1944, Banco de M6xico]) and internal organs (as in Henry Ford Hospital [1932, Fundaci6n Dolores Olmedo Patifio, Mexico City] and The Two Fridas [1939, Museo de Arte Moderno, Mexico City]), a kind of "turning the inside out," also conforms to an established tradition of grotesquerie, as does her assumption of animality in The Little Deer (1946, Banco de M6xico); see Stewart, "The Grotesque Body," 104-11. 138. Dominguez (as in n. 134) writes evocatively of the "way in which a person's growing or continuing interest in some thing becomes a form of affirming or extending the boundaries of that person's self' (554). 139. This painting (private collection, New York), made during Kahlo and Rivera's sojourn in Detroit, where he painted murals for the Institute of Arts, shows the artist at the center of a bifurcated composition that contrasts the skyscrapers and factories of the modern and industrialized United States and the timeless landscape and ancient architecture and sculpture of Mexico. Two female effigies (one an Arenal-style effigy fromJalisco, the other, according to Braun [1998, 274], from the Casas Grande/Paquim6 culture of northern Mexico) occupy the earthen ground plane of the picture's Mexican side, which is cut away to reveal the roots of cacti, marigolds, and other indigenous flora that appear in the left foreground, and are played off against the electrical cords that tether the machines in the right foreground. This self-portrait is reproduced and discussed in Hayden Herrera, Frida Kahlo, the Paintings (NewYork: HarperCollins, 1991), 94-98. 140. In My Nurse and I (Fundaci6n Dolores Olmedo Patifio, Mexico City) Kahlo shows herself imbibing indianismo with milk that drips from the breasts of her dark-skinned wet nurse, whose face is concealed by a Teotihuacan-style mask. Turning the common West Mexican practice of depicting infants as miniature adults to her own ends, Kahlo shows "baby" Frida as a dwarfish prefiguration of her mature self, Christlike in her apparent cognizance of the trials to come. According to Salom6n Grimberg, the nursing figure was inspired by aJalisco effigy from Kahlo's own collection; Grimberg, Frida Kahlo, exh. cat., Meadows Museum, Dallas, 1989, 66 n. 6. Four Inhabitants (private collection, Palo Alto) shows Kahlo as a child in Coyoacin, gazing at the indigenous types of the picture's title, who seem to model Mexicanidad for the lost-looking, finger-sucking girl. Three of the four are male figures of the sort made by contemporary Mexican craftspeople (a woven straw man astride a straw burro, a papier-machi Judas figure, a Day of the Dead skeleton). The other member of the quartet is a broken-footed effigy from Nayarit (based on a sculpture from Rivera's collection, which is pictured in Midioni and Pinto, nos. 60, 61). The Nayarit figure represents a pregnant woman, who appears to be both mother figure and alter ego for Kahlo; see Herrera (as in n. 139), 24. Like the Nayarit effigy, Kahlo herself was missing several toes, having had them amputated as the result of ulceration in 1934; Margaret A. Lindauer, Devouring Frida: The Art History and Popular Celebrity of Frida Kahlo (Hanover, N.H.: Wesleyan University Press and University Press of New England, 1999), 56. Kahlo's envisionings of a childhood that might have been, cobbled together from the visual materials of her adulthood, seem to conform to what Stewart calls "the world of the souvenir" (observable in photograph albums as well as</page><page sequence="32">THE AFTERLIFE OF WEST MEXICAN BURIAL EFFIGIES 765 collections of antiquarian relics): "a collage made of presents rather than a reawakening of the past," an anteriority "constructed from a set of presently existing pieces" (145). 141. Baudrillard, 76. 142. Baudrillard writes that the "taste for antiques and the passion for collecting" are in many ways comparable: "in both we find the same narcissistic regression, the same way of suppressing time, the same imaginary mastery of birth and death" (76). Kahlo's obsession with her own birth and death is evident in her oeuvre. 143. Ibid., 80. The fanciful regression facilitated by the manipulation of artifacts allows their possessor to feel "I am not the one who is, in the present, full of angst-rather, I am the one who has been, as indicated by the course of the reverse birth of which the antique object is a sign" (Baudrillard, 75-76, his emphasis). 144. The children at far left are Kahlo's nephew and niece; at far right is her pet deer, Granzio. AJudas figure and a plaster, spring-limbed Day of the Dead skeleton occupy the table with Kahlo and an outsize Nayarit effigy in the Ixtltn style. 145. The Judas might be read as a surrogate for Rivera, who collected such figures. 146. The configuration formed by Kahlo's self-portrait and the overgrown male ceramic she depicts beside (and abutting) her seems to have been directly inspired by a joined "marriage pair" in Rivera's collection (see M6dioni and Pinto, no. 52), although the painted variant reads like a mirror reversal of its ceramic forebear, in which the male figure sits to the female figure's left. The figures in the Nayarit piece have their closest arms around one another's shoulders and the female holds a cup to the male's lips with an arm that is almost as exaggeratedly lengthy as the one thatjoins Kahlo and the effigy in The Wounded Table. 147. Emaciated figures seated in hunched fetal postures, chins and elbows resting on raised knees, are common enough to Nayarit figuration to constitute a recognized type (see Kan et al., 97, nos. 48, 49; 102, nos. 56a-c). Popularly known as mourners, the figures are mainly male and probably represent people in hallucinogen-induced trances who have prepared them- selves for ritual-related drug use by purging and fasting. Similar effigies were made by the Taino of the Caribbean; see Peter G. Roe, "Just Wasting Away: Taino Shamanism and Concepts of Fertility," in Taino: Pre-Columbian Art and Culture from the Caribbean, exh. cat., El Museo del Barrio, New York, 1997, 124-57, cf. no. 104. 148. Kahlo, for instance, is said to have claimed that after her marriage to Rivera she simply "started to paint what he liked. From that time on, he loved and admired me." She tended to speak of the antiquities in their home as "his" rather than "mine" or even "ours," and while she lauded Rivera's collection ("jewels of indigenous art-the living heart of Mexico") and his long-term commitment to amassing it ("over more than 30 years, with enormous sacrifices") she seems to have said nothing about her own role in acquiring antiquities for La Casa Azul, where many remain on view today (Martha Zamora, ed., Frida Kahlo: Cartas Apasionadas [San Francisco: Chronicle Books, 1995], 149). Though Salom6n Grimberg (as in n. 140) makes glancing reference to Kahlo's own West Mexican holdings (11), the prevailing assump- tion-fostered, it would seem, by Kahlo herself-is that she painted objects Rivera bought and brought home (28-29 n. 24). 149. Rivera (as in n. 102), 250-51. 150. This is the title Rivera gave to the chapter concerning Anahuacalli in the autobiography he wrote with Gladys March (Rivera, 1960). Unfinished at the time of Rivera's death in 1957, Anahuacalli opened to the public in 1964. It has the capacity to display some two thousand selections from Rivera's sixty-thousand-piece collection of Mesoamerican art. 151. See Braun, 1993, 267-68. As Shelly Errington has noted, Rivera's emphatic glorification of things Aztec may be seen as part of a larger trend in modern Mexico (Errington, chap. 6, "Nationalizing the Pre-Columbian Past in Mexico and the United States," 161-79; and idem, "Progressivist Stories and the Pre-Columbian Past," in Boone, 234-41). 152. In "El espiritu revolucionario en el arte moderno," Rivera asserts that all painters--even Giotto-are propagandists (and contends that the bour- geois notion that propaganda ruins art stems from the middle-class fear that circulation of ideas might upset the status quo). Having noted that "every strong artist has been a propagandist," Rivera proclaimed: "I want to be a propagandist and nothing else"; Rivera, 1932 (as in n. 101), 170-71. 153. The opposed ways in which Rivera and Berman manipulated cultural remnants may be seen to exemplify differences between two types of collectors-the antiquarian and the mercantilist-whom Stewart portrays as antithetical. "The antiquarian," Stewart writes (153), "is moved by a nostalgia of origin and presence; his function is to validate the culture of ground .... But the mercantilist is not moved by restoration; he is moved by extraction and seriality. He removes the object from context and places it within the play of signifiers that characterize an exchange economy." 154. Root remarks that "the Mexico of the Western imagination tends to come in three basic varieties": Aztec Mexico (blood sacrifice and abundant gold), Maya Mexico ("jungle, mystery and lost cities"), and the modern Mexico often portrayed as the fugitive's last recourse, a land of "lawlessness and alcohol" (51-53). Though the last of these tropes (which Root identifies with "North American popular culture") comes closest to Berman's con- struct, it doesn't really accommodate a view of Mexico that was common enough in the 1950s and 1960s: for many norteamericanos of that era, Mexico evoked warmth, smiling subservience, and inexpensive adventure-along with alcohol-in a lush land that was, indeed, rather "sunny"; witness Elvis having Fun in Acapulco (1963). 155. Rivera subscribed to an international school of thought described by Root: "Many post-World War I writers and artists in Europe believed that non-Western, traditional societies were able to clarify the nature of community and collective action, which in their view had been debased by modern systems of production and individualism" (34). 156. A fabricated coffee pot lid was, for instance, added to the empty right hand of the Colima conch blower in "Dexter" (Fig. 8). A similar instance of manipulation may be seen in "How do I love thee?" (1966), wherein aJalisco effigy's hand-held drinking bowl (visible as part of the same figure in "A party favorite from way back" [Fig. 7]) is airbrushed out to provide the "speaker" with a properly declamatory gesture. Sans prop, the effigy's hands suggest high-flown versifying, especially in conjunction with its inclined head, parted lips, and adjoining rhymed copy that parodies Elizabeth Barrett Browning's Sonnets from the Portuguese. 157. Many female effigies from West Mexico holdjars, cups, and small bowls (Figs. 1, 3, 7). These vessels often are offered to male figures, and many male effigies are seen to consume the contents of such vessels, either by holding them to their lips or using strawlike tubes to sip the liquid or inhale the smoke or fumes contained therein. A figure using this sort of tube appears front and center in "A party favorite from way back" (Fig. 7). 158. A rare allusion to Mesoamerican shamanism is made in an ad of 1965 that features a shadowy photograph of a gesticulating Colima effigy adorned by horned headdress and turtle-shell pectoral. Its suggestion of ancient ceremony is shrugged off with the boldface assertion that "With some people Kahlia is a ritual" and accompanying text that jokingly portrays suburban Kahlia drinking as a sacred rite and the liqueur itself as a "magical mixture from Old Mexico." 159. It is often noted that the star power that sold ads to advertisers in the 1960s was that of the ad makers themselves, most notably, Bill Bernbach and Mary Wells (of DDB), David Ogilvy (Ogilvy and Mather), and Leo Burnett (who headed the eponymous agency). See Stephen Fox, chap. 6, "The Creative Revolution," in The MirrorMakers: A History ofAmerican Advertising and Its Creators (Urbana, Ill.: University of Illinois Press, 1984), 218-71. For a brief history of the genesis and evolution of brand mascots in the United States, see Warren Dotz and Jim Morton, What a Character! 20th Century American AdvertisingIcons (San Francisco: Chronicle Books, 1996). 160. As Stewart notes, "The past is at the service of the collection." Contrasting the collected object to the souvenir, Stewart elaborates, "Whereas the souvenir lends authenticity to the past, the pasts lends authenticity to the collection" (151). 161. Ibid., 156. Stewart also writes of "the replacement of the narrative of history with the narrative of the individual subject-that is, the collector himself." In this case, however, the collector is masked by the commodity he sells. 162. A selection of Berman's Mesoamerican sculptures was exhibited at the Municipal Art Gallery of Los Angeles as The Jules Berman Kahltia Collection of Mexican Pre-Columbian Art in 1968. Many of the same pieces were part of the exhibition titled The Jules Berman Collection of Mexican Pre-Columbian Art at the San Diego Fine Arts Gallery in 1973 (though, with one hundred works, it was twice as large as the earlier show). Several of the objects on view in these exhibitions had or would appear in Kahlfia advertising, but many others never did. 163. I have found only two instances in which pieces connected to Berman appear in ads produced by EJL. The wide-mouthed effigy jar that appears in EJL's "The laundry starched your shorts" (1971) may be found amid the two dozen pieces that appear in "Fondueing it," a Berman ad of 1968, and the helmeted Colima effigy cast in EJL's "Your first vacation" (1971) is pictured on the back cover and on p. 17 of Pahl and Stern. 164. See n. 20 above. 165.Jules Berman, personal communication with author, 1998. Andrea Giambrone, though uncertain of the figures' ownership, confirms that a number of Pre-Columbian effigies were on hand for her use when she took on the Kahlflia account (personal communication with author, 1998). Whatever their source(s), none of the ceramics used in Kahlfia ads made after 1970 had been featured players in ads of the Berman era. 166. The company's lack of commitment to this apparent ruse is indicated by the fact that it was employed inconsistently. Ads using pieces with no discernible connection to Berman ran with fine-print assertion of affiliation with the then-nonexistent "Kahlia collection" (for example, Fig. 16), while an ad featuring a Colima effigy from Berman's collection (and exhibited in 1968 as part of the "Jules Berman Kahlia Collection") ran without the gloss ("Your first vacation," 1971). In at least one instance, an ad ran both with and without reference to its provenance ("You know the waiter didn't mean to spill the coffee," 1971). 167. Giambrone, personal communication with author, 1998. 168. Giambrone, 1. 169. "Separate checks" (Fig. 12) is Giambrone's favorite ad of the Berman era (personal communication with author, 1998) and probably informed her preference for pairing specific drinks and figures.</page><page sequence="33">766 ART BULLETIN DECEMBER 2000 VOLUME LXXXII NUMBER 4 170. Giambrone, 2; she notes that this slogan was devised well in advance of the MacDonald's "You deserve a break" campaign. 171. Ibid. 172. Ibid., 3. 173. Ibid. Giambrone refers to the veteran newsman who anchored The CBS Evening News from 1962 to 1981. 174. Ibid. 175. In addition to the "snuggling" couple fromJalisco chosen to corrobo- rate the appeal of Kahlia and Coffee by the fireside (Giambrone, 3, Fig. 17), a male/female pair was used in the "Thought Balloon" campaign's Kahlia and Milk collage ("A cool idea," 1973). Since that drink was aimed at youthful consumers, figures of the distinctive Zacatecas style (like the "Martian" of Fig. 3) were chosen for its promotion; the Zacatecas effigies' animated expressions and flamboyant ornament were combined with an exuberant, of-the-moment affirmation-"Right on!"-to suggest contemporary "cool." 176. "An intriguing idea," 1971. That two female figures accompany the collage evoking Kahluia fondue ("A dippy idea," 1972) would seem to reflect assumptions about the gendered nature of dessert making in the early 1970s, and the ad team's choice of resemblant figures for that ad (both are Ameca-style effigies from Jalisco) may have been intended to suggest a biological relationship and, thus, the exchange of "family recipes." The presumption of a familial relationship between the two Ameca dessert mavens would perhaps help to account for the asperity of the respondent's observa- tion that Kahlfia fondue "sure beats your kumquat souffl6." 177. Giambrone, 4. 178. In some ads, the chosen effigies' flat affects are played for laughs. The impassive mien of the Nayarit figure cast as a victorious boater in an ad of 1976, for instance, seems so emphatically out of sync with the texted excitement-"The mood: we won!"-as to be intentionally ironic. 179. Giambrone, 4. 180. In addition to Figure 18, see, for example, two ads of the late 1970s, "The surf: up" and "The place: far out," wherein sun- and wave-drenched effigies are seated on sandy expanses. 181. Schudson, chap. 7, "Advertising as Capitalist Realism," 211, 212, 231. Schudson derives the term from the state-sanctioned art of the Soviet Union known as Socialist Realism, whose agendas he sees echoed in advertising in the United States of the later 20th century. Like Socialist Realism, Schudson observes, a good deal of national consumer goods advertising simplifies and typifies; presents "life as it should become"; pictures reality "not in its individuality" but in abstract terms; is relentlessly optimistic; and endorses certain ways of life through intensely "pleasing" imagery. "Needless to say, most advertising is dull and conventional," Schudson writes, and "Capitalist realist art, like social realism, more often flattens than deepens experience" (222, 230). 182. Sivulka writes that "in this new climate tight budgets and cautious clients substantially changed the way Madison Avenue operated" (337). She cites Jerry Della Femina's remark to Advertising Age in 1976 that "advertising isn't fun anymore," and she notes that Al Ries andJack Trout (who ran a small New York agency at the time) elaborated on that theme in a series of articles for the same journal, asserting that "creativity is dead" (338). Sivulka describes a general sense among ad writers and their clients that humor distracted from product and notes a widespread tendency to peg a "position" and stick with it, "to the point of monotony" (339). 183. For recent accounts of the primitive's New Age fashionableness, see Root, esp. chap. 3, "Conquest, Appropriation, and Cultural Difference," 67-106; Errington, esp. chap. 5, "Authenticity, Primitivism, and Art Revis- ited," 137-57; and Phillips and Steiner, 16-19. 184. See Sivulka, chap. 7, "1960-1975: The Creative Revolution," 290-333, esp. 316-21. While Sivulka is mainly concerned with the impact of the civil rights movement on the advertising industry's treatments of African Ameri- cans, she notes that pressure from Mexican Americans forced the retirement of the Frito Bandito character in 1970. "Similarly," Sivulka writes, "Funny Face fruit drink for children transformed the ethnic characters originally used to promote the product. 'Chinese Cherry' became 'Choo-Choo Cherry,' while 'Injun Orange' became 'Jolly Olly Orange' " (320). 185. According to Root, "Exoticism evokes a sensibility and uses objects to construct a conceptual line of escape out of Western culture into a titillating, yet manageable other. Appropriation incorporates the objects and sensibilities into the dominant, Western-based culture, sometimes by domesticating and sometimes by erasing the origins of these objects. Although exoticism does the same and to some extent exoticism and appropriation are overlapping concepts, with appropriation it is the taking up that is important" (78). Nicholas Thomas also seeks to clarify the distinction between the primitive, which stands "in antithetical relation to modernity," and the exotic, which "has more to do with difference and strangeness"; see Thomas, chap. 6, "The Primitivist and the Postcolonial," in Colonialism's Culture: Anthropology, Travel and Government (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994), 170-95. 186. See n. 28 above. 187. Since the records and recollections of the genesis of the second Kahlia collection to which I have had access are sketchy, my account remains provisional. Though I have been unable to determine precisely when and why EJL (funded by Hiram Walker and Sons) began buying Mesoamerican ceramics, I have traced appearances of pieces from the second collection to ads designed in the mid-1970s (including "The mood: we won!" [1976] and another "Time-Mood-Place" ad of the later 1970s, "The surf: up"). 188. Giambrone shared recollections of her buying practices with me in personal conversations in 1998; the account that follows (in this and the next paragraph) is mainly a paraphrase of those conversations, though the words and phrases so marked are direct quotations of Giambrone's remarks. 189. Giambrone told me that her ad team wished to avoid the sorts of photomechanical enlargements and downsizings that Berman's often em- ployed. 190. By 1980, Kahlia and EJL had decided to promote four basic Kahlfia cocktails: the Black Russian, the White Russian, Kahlfia and Coffee, and Kahlfia and Cream. While the Black Russian was consistently paired with dark-toned ceramics, the other three drinks were usually paired in print ads with white-glazed figures (though only the White Russian and Kahlfia and Cream required milk). Kahlfia and ice cream were combined in several recipes the company promoted. 191. A move to limit the number of Kahlfia-connoting figures, in addition to being cost-effective, would have conformed to the agency's institution of a standard and streamlined format for brand ads. It might also have proved beneficial from a marketing standpoint, given the prevalence of singular brand mascots in postwar advertising in the United States. 192. Giambrone's tendency to refer to the West Mexican pieces she worked with for more than twenty years as "the little gods" or "tiki gods" suggests the ad team's lack of concern with what or whom the figures represented in anything but a here-and-now commercial context and reflects a more general popular tendency to conflate otherness in its myriad forms as singularly different from "us." (Tikis are Maori or Marquesan figures made of stone or wood; they represent supernaturals, which West Mexican ceramics almost certainly do not.) 193. As it stands today, the second Kahlfia collection, documented by an in-house catalogue of Nov. 1991 (author unknown), includes twelve effigies from Nayarit (half of which are of the so-called Chinesco type), six from Colima, five fromJalisco, and a single "smiling face" figure in the Remojadas style of ancient Veracruz. The preponderance of Nayarit pieces-shunned by some collectors (see n. 214 below)-may have been related to price and availability rather than formal qualities; the fakes EJL commissioned in the 1990s draw mainly on Colima andJalisco prototypes (see below). 194. I first heard "the preke" referred to as such by Brandon Steele, Kahlfia's international marketing manager, who told me the term had been in long usage at EJL and within the Kahlfia organization. Giambrone confirms Steele's assertion. "The preke," both concurred, refers not to any particular figure, nor to some conceptual abstraction; instead, the term indicates, collectively, the various Pre-Columbian figures used in Kahlfia ads (personal communications with author, 1998). 195. Williamson, 79. Schudson mentions the same trend, if briefly, noting that unpeopled ads are produced "in an effort not to exclude any potential customers from identifying with the product" (213). 196. Williamson, 78-79. Giambrone confirms, "We're inviting the con- sumer into the mood we're setting" (4). 197. Williamson, 79. 198. Ibid., 77. Williamson's enter-to-mean ads include components in- tended to jump off the page and into consumer consciousness-like the Pre-Columbian effigies in Marks's and Berman's Kahlfia ads, "characters" whose odd looks combined with the jocular address imputed to them to command viewer attention. 199. EJL's use of painted backdrops is in keeping with the aesthetics of Schudson's "Capitalist Realism," in which locales often resemble postcards rather than physical space (211). 200. See Graburn (as in n. 43). The drinkers evoked by EJL's tasteful still lifes seem to enjoy more rarefied existences than the Kahlfa fans enacted by Mesoamerican ceramics in the late 1960s-folks who basted chicken with their favorite liqueur and reacted violently when supplies ran low. 201. This assumption jibes with Giambrone's assertion that EJL's ad team sought to particularize varied Kahlia concoctions by suggesting the people and situations most likely to call for them and "matched Pre-Columbians to drinks" (personal communication with author, 1998). 202. One such Chinesco appears in the ad for Kahlia and Coffee, contrast- ing rather than mirroring the darkness of that brew, while the other pulls double duty, pitching two different milk-based drinks. 203. The presence of a watchful Mexican burial effigy in this American pastoral exemplifies the sorts of "non-senses" that, as Williamson notes, advertisers often get away with: "When advertising puts two things side by side, so that they coexist, we do not question the sense of it," she writes (29). 204. Steele, personal communication with author, 1998. 205. Ibid. 206. Chet Zar, the artisan who fabricated Kahlia's cast of fakes, recalls that though his assignment usually involved incorporating pleasing aspects of extant effigies-the color of one figure, the accessories or proportions of another-an overarching goal was to make the figures he fashioned "look happier" than the originals on which they were based (personal communica- tion with author, 1999). 207. When hired by EJL, Zar had spent several years working in special effects, makeup, and props production; his work for Kahlia, he told me, constituted his "first exposure" to Pre-Columbian art of any sort (ibid.).</page><page sequence="34">THE AFTERLIFE OF WEST MEXICAN BURIAL EFFIGIES 767 208. Zar says that though he would have preferred to cast the figures from molds, then sand and paint them, time constraints forced him to make most of them from Sculpey, a craft product that can be hand-modeled and baked in the oven. Each, he notes, is a unique object; no replicas were made. 209. Two of the seven male figures EJL commissioned are warriors. 210. Zar's work on any given figurine was guided by photographs of West Mexican models, an art director's sketched conception of the finished product, and specifications of size, color, expression (invariably, he says, a "nicer" expression was requested, which usually meant "smiling a little"), and positioning of limbs (so that the figure could "relate to" a Kahlia bottle). Early on, Zar says, the actual ceramics on which he was to base his (much smaller) composites were shipped to him as well. Personal communication with author, 1999. 211. Many Ameca-style effigies depicting women have extended arms terminating in hands that are flexed perpendicularly. When both arms are thus extended, they tend to project away from the body laterally (see, for example, Gallagher [as in n. 3], no. 111; Kan et al., no. 69). Arms extending forward (as in the Kahlia fake Zar crafted) usually are singular rather than paired; while the figure's right arm extends before it in a gesture that seems to demand arrest, its left arm generally is bent to position the left hand behind the figure's head (see, for example, Gallagher, nos. 112, 123; Kan et al., no. 74). This common posture, according to Furst's Huichol informants, is one that only a woman would assume; it represents an entreaty to supernaturals governing fertility, pregnancy, and childbirth to stop menstruation and allow the petitioner to conceive (Furst, 1973 [as in n. 86], 125). Some examples of figures with both arms extended forward exist (see, for example, Gallagher, no. 113; Kan et al., no. 80), but it seems to me most likely that if Zar's takeoff was based on a particular prototype, Zar was working from a female Ameca figure whose gender was transformed and whose bent left arm was reposi- tioned to mirror its extended right one. 212. While one of the commissioned fakes-a standing warrior of exaggerat- edly jolly mien-wears (in an instance of gender-bending costuming) a Nayarit-inspired skirt, that figurine (seen in "It's Killer," 1995) has fallen so far from the tree as to be almost unrecognizable as West Mexican; like Kahlhia's Jalisco/Colima composite (Fig. 22), "Killer" is so free a translation as to emerge an entity unto itself rather than existing primarily as a copy of something else. 213. Fuente (as in n. 29), 90. Having lauded the technical "perfection" and wide-ranging subject matter of Colima ceramics, Fuente notes that Jalisco effigies "fail to compete," and brands Nayarit figural sculpture "crude" and "clumsy." 214. For instance, Marion and Mark Lynton, though avid collectors of Colima ceramics, routinely shunned the production of other West Mexican regions, finding many Jalisco pieces "too brutal in expression and too 'uncouth' in aesthetic appearance." They recall that as they built their West Mexican collection, "Nayarit effigies from the Ixtlin del Rio area, though of major importance, were deliberately omitted from the start as being too grotesque and ugly in appearance"; Lynton and Lynton, "Why Just West Mexico?" in Out of the Depths: Tomb Figures from West Mexico, exh. cat., Rautenstrauch-Joest Museum of Ethnography, Cologne, 1987, 29-30. 215. Apparently Zar's "nicer" version of this figure's face did not go far enough, since its mouth was photomechanically altered to a wide grin when it was used in an ad designed for the Canadian market ("Music for your mouth," 1995). Giambrone, personal communication with author, 1998. 216. Another Colima figure from the corporate collection was reduced to a third of its size in a version designed for incorporation in a joined pair that appeared in "Steamy affair" (1994). With one hand emptied and the other repositioned to embrace a female companion, this onetime ballplayer became the embodiment of a contented swain, whose partner, based on a male shaman figure from Colima, was feminized by summarily rendered breasts. 217.
