<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Jewish Quarterly Review, Vol.95, No. 3 (Summer 2005) 435-442 Jewish Bodies, Jewish Minds LEON WIESELTIER In RECENT DECADES the American sense of life has fallen under the spell of matter. In realm after realm of our existence, our explanations more and more adduce material causes, particularly biological ones and economic ones. Riddles of psychology are solved with references to biol ogy, especially to genes and to Darwin; riddles of politics and interna tional relations are solved with references to economics; and so on. Science has been twisted and promoted into scientism, and economics into economicism. The mind has become the brain. A dizzy era of techno logical utopianism has inculcated Americans with the belief that the best account of anything is an account of how it works, as opposed to an account of what it stands for and how it stands for it. As we master more and more gadgets of spectacular complexity, we come to believe that there is no higher kind of mastery than this. We are praxis junkies and freaks of information. Add to all this the frantically consumerist ethos of American society, in which the most widespread instrument of self expression is shopping, and it may be said that we are living in a new dark age of materialism, philosophical and unphilosophical. The belief in the mind, and in the autonomy of its productions, and in the power of its productions to act as irreducible causes, is regarded as an archaism ? as a "master narrative," than which there is no greater malediction. Never mind that materialism is a master narrative if ever there was one. It was inevitable, I suppose, that Jewish studies in the United States would sooner or later join in the anti-idealist fun. Jewish studies have always taken on the tincture of their surroundings, not least because criti cal Jewish scholarship has rarely managed to slough off the apologetic spirit in which it was born almost two centuries ago. Apologetics come in many varieties. And so cultural materialism has arrived at Jewish studies departments, with excited reports of important discoveries. (By cultural materialism I mean the view that mental expressions have their most sig nificant or most interesting causes outside the mind, in its extra-intellec The Jewish Quarterly Review (Summer 2005) Copyright ? 2005 Center for Advanced Judaic Studies.

The history of the Jewish body was established to dispel a certain stereotype of the Jews, the old image of them as essentially "the People of the Book." It is an exercise in what Howard Eilberg-Schwartz, a pioneering scholar in this enterprise, described ten years ago as "re-membering"1 the Jewish body. The history of the Jewish body, he announced, would serve as "a reminder that Jews do not simply read and write books. Like other people, they have bodies" (PB, 7). I confess that I have never encountered a Jew, or a historian of the Jews, who thought that Jews do not have bodies. But Eilberg-Schwartz persisted in his con viction that he was bringing news: "There is a danger that the description [of the Jews] as 'People of the Book' will enable the issue of bodily repro duction and sexual intercourse to slide out of sight behind the symbol of the Jew poring over the text" (PB, 2), he wrote. And he added: "By shifting attention from the image of the Jews as a textual community to the ways Jews understand and manage their bodies ?for example, to their concerns with reproduction and sexuality, marriage and death?we hope to contribute to a different picture of what Jews and Judaism are and have been" (PB, 7). In this way, Jewish historians will succeed in turning back "a larger modern strategy that attempts to disembody Jews and Judaism in hopes of spiritualizing them" (PB, 3). There are a number of objections that may be immediately offered to such a scholarly program. For a start, it is premised upon the very pecu liar notion that the "textual" conception of Jewish identity, which it cor rectly regards as the normative conception of Jewish identity for most of Jewish history, lacked (or more likely repressed) any understanding of the corporeal dimensions of Jewish life. It projects an odd Victorianism, the image of its own fear, back into the Jewish past. But as any student of Jewish religious literature knows, this literature is richly and unabash edly engaged with sexual questions, and more generally with the experi ence of the Jewish body, male and female. Whole fields of Jewish law and Jewish myth were inspired by a recognition of the reality, and the urgency, and the poetry, of the erotic subject. There was no denial. This is not to say, of course, that ancient or medieval Jews regarded the body as modern Jews or modern scholars do; but that is not, I hope, the issue. The issue is whether or not they regarded the corporeal dimensions of 1.

This is an empirical matter, not an ideological one. Moreover, the "People of the Body" is no less a stereotype than the "People of the Book," for the simple reason that it bases its revisionism upon the same coarse dualism of mind and body for which it indicts the scholarship that it wishes to revise. It is certainly the case that ancient and medieval Jewish thought operated with distinctions between body and soul, between matter and form; but it did not build a wall between the terms. Quite the contrary. It mixed the terms, and made law and metaphysics out of the mixtures. The schools of Jewish theology and the schools of Jewish jurisprudence may be defined in part by the particular relations between the terms that they each posited. The life of the Jew was conceived as a great saga of engagement ? before birth and after birth, before death and after death ? between form and matter, between body and soul. The soul loved the body or the soul hated the body, de pending on which authority you prefer. But the Jewish person was what Caroline Walker Bynum, in her study of medieval notions of identity, called a "psycho-somatic unity" ? or in this instance, to borrow an old joke of Meyer Schapiro's, a psycho-semitic unity. The body was in the book and the book was in the body. For this reason, the study of the Jewish body does not require, as most of its practitioners believe that it requires, an uncritical acceptance of cultural materialism. In his account of his historical method, Daniel Boyar?n prescribes that "some kind of materialism must be assumed,"2 and leaves it at that. But the study of matter is an activity of mind, and in the Jewish case what it finds again and again ? the true subject, I think, of Jewish cultural materialism ? is the inscription of Jewish mind upon Jewish matter. The laws of menstruation, for instance, are not some kind of "privileging" of the body over the mind that await rediscovery by scholars newly sensitized to considerations of gender; they are, and they always have been, plainly for all to see, the interpretation of the Jewish body by the Jewish mind: the application to corporeal life of certain ideas which are not themselves corporeal in origin, but which nonetheless pre sume to order and to explain corporeal life, to confer meaning upon it. But the meaning that they confer upon it is metacorporeal, metaphysical; and thus the Jewish scholar, if he or she is to comprehend this phenome non correctly, is immediately thrown back from the body to the book, to the supremacy of the incorporeal. Such a development does not amount 2. Daniel Boyarin, Carnal Lirael: Reading Sex in Talmu?ic Culture (Berkeley, Calif, 1993), 13. Henceforth, CIin the body of the text.</page><page sequence="4">438 JQR 95.3 (2005) to a denial of the body. But the body is not its own interpreter. The "construction" of the body is not a bodily activity. The Jewish traditions about sexual intercourse and sexual hygiene are intellectual traditions, not physical traditions. They seek to legislate and to legitimate practices with concepts. This is the complication, the tension, the paradox, the play of freedom that the materialist utterly fails to grasp. And the failure to acknowledge the interp?n?tration of idea and act in Judaism is a failure of historical method. I do not mean that the historian of Jewish religion is perforce a meta physician. I mean only that the historian of Judaism and Jewish life is perforce a student of metaphysicians, because his subjects were, at the highest levels and at the lowest ones, in their theologies and in their su perstitions, knowingly and unknowingly, metaphysicians; and so the his torian of Judaism must concede, if not actually celebrate, the centrality, and the causal role, of Jewish ideas in the determination of Jewish cus toms. You do not have to be a believer to be a historian of believers, but you must be a respecter of belief. If you regard belief as illusion, you must nonetheless acknowledge the reality of illusion in human affairs. In the modern period, to be sure, the subjects of Jewish historical inquiry become more diversified, and for many of those subjects (though by no means for all of them) the grip of metaphysics has been broken; but the grip of ideas has certainly not been broken. Modernization, like the tradi tion that it set itself against, was significantly an affair of ideas. A rupture, an emancipation, a betrayal: however you construe what happened in Western Jewish life in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, it repre sented a new series of justifications for the way in which Jews now pro posed to behave. In sum, I do not see how the Jewish historian can do his or her work adequately without accepting the primacy of conscious ness. This is not a very sophisticated philosophical commitment, but it certainly is a philosophical commitment. It does not commit the historian to the view that the material world has no impact on consciousness. Such a view is obviously untrue. But it does commit the historian to the view that the dependence of consciousness upon the material world is never complete. It is hard to think of a story that more resoundingly illustrates the exceeding of circumstance by consciousness than the story of the Jews. But some of the most prominent advocates of a "re-embodiment" of Judaism and Jewish studies are reluctant to make the rudimentary philo sophical commitment that I have just described. "People are bodies, not spirits" (CI, 10), Daniel Boyarin asserts in his study of "carnal Israel." Is this the opinion of his body? In much of his analysis of rabbinical Juda</page><page sequence="5">JEWISH BODIES, JEWISH MINDS-WIESELTIER 439 ism, he seems to be thinking with his body. But how does his body know? This is a fine illustration of the totalizing tendency of the materialist. "While in most matters of detail precisely what marks the rabbinic cul ture is its heterogeneity," Boyarin concludes, "this very heterogeneity is founded on an underlying unity, the interpretation of human being as fundamentally, essentially corporeal" (CI, 29). This is a terrific simplifi cation. Boyarin appears to draw this conclusion from his appreciation of the favorable attitude of the ancient rabbis toward marriage, and toward carnality in marriage?an attitude notably unlike the ancient Christian adoption of celibacy as an ideal. "The rabbis regard marriage and sexual intercourse as the return to the originary and ideal state of human being" (CI, 18), Boyarin argues. Perhaps; but there is a difference between ori gin and essence. What I come from and what I am are not the same; and the confusion of what I am with what I come from has an unpleasant Heideggerian aftertaste. Boyarin does not distinguish between a positive view of sex and a corporeal view of reality. He is like a man who has enjoyed a delicious meal and so concludes that food is all there is. A similar monism, a similar confusion, may be found in his view of midrash as an "embodied" method of hermeneutics. Boyarin is infatuated with a comment of Augustine's in Tractatu? adversos Judaeos, a gloss on 1 Cor. 10.18: "Behold Israel according to the flesh." Augustine explains: "This we know to be the carnal Israel; but the Jews do not grasp this meaning and as a result they prove themselves indisputably carnal." Boyarin mysteriously remarks that "Augustine knew what he was talking about" (CI, 1). Since he, too, wishes to behold Israel according to the flesh, he offers no resistance to Augustine's comment, which is in fact nothing more than a restatement of the most hoary and hostile Christian platitude about Judaism and the Jews. Boyarin expands Augustine's re mark into a theory of allegory. If Israel remains "in the flesh," it is be cause the rabbis cannot detach their interpretations of scriptural passages and historical events sufficiently from their occasions, so as to discover immaterial meaning in material occasions. "Midrash," he writes, "the her meneutic system of rabbinic Judaism, seems precisely to refuse that dual ism, eschewing the inner-outer, visible-invisible, body-soul dichotomies of allegorical reading. Midrash and platonic [that is, Christian] allegory are alternative techniques of the body" (CI, 9). Now, I hope that I do not expose myself as a stiff-necked literalist when I say that midrash seems to me more a technique of the mind than a technique of the body. Sticks and stones may break my bones but midrash will never hurt me. Boyarin s notion of the one-dimensionality of midrash strains credulity: what often strikes the reader of midrash about the ma?hal and the nimshal</page><page sequence="6">440 JQR 95.3 (2005) of rabbinical allegory is precisely its wildness, its startling lack of herme neutical inhibition, its irrepressible imagination of precisely what is not at all apparent in the "flesh" that is its text. And it is worth pointing out that, except for believing Christians, the word is not the flesh; the notion that the word is the flesh is merely a metaphor. Augustine was spinning a theological dogma out of this metaphor, in the way that Boyarin is spinning a historiographical dogma out of it. The reverence of the rabbis for the text ?a reverence, again, that did not inhibit them from the most extreme exegetical liberties ? was not a technique of embodiment. It was a technique of conceptual imagination. Its concreteness was not the mate rial kind. The question of embodiment and disembodiment in the Jewish religion owes much, of course, to the question of embodiment and disembodiment in the Jewish God. The somatists among Jewish historians dwell exten sively upon the theological imagery in the Hebrew Bible, which is physi cal, and also plentiful, and also upon those strains in rabbinical literature that accept and develop the corporealization of the divine. These scholars find support for their cause more in the mystical traditions than in the philosophical traditions, more in Jewish myth than in Jewish allegory. For the philosophical traditions are almost unanimous in their insistence upon the incorporeality of God and therefore upon the allegorical inter pretation of the anthropomorphic expressions about God in Scripture. I say almost, so as to leave a little room and a little honor for one of the heroes of the historians of the body, the strange thirteenth-century Cen tral European figure of Moshe ben Hisdai Taku, who denounced the phi losophers, notably Saadiah and Maimonides, as heretics for their refusal to endorse the literal meaning of the revealed descriptions of God. But surely Taku is an odd hero for progressives. When did a love of literalism become an advanced position in the theory of interpretation? Why do the somatists among our historians not see that, when they champion what one of them affectionately calls "the organ-izing of divinity," they are undoing a glorious history of intellectual sophistication, a history that stretches back to the anxiety of the ancient Aramaic translators of the Bible about the philosophical crudity of anthropomorphic language? That anxiety, I hasten to add, was not a problem of prudery. Nor was it an attempt at pretending that the God of the Jews is dis-organized: the limbs of God are strewn all over the Bible; there was no point in repress ing them and there was no need to recover them. The "body" of God has been an overwhelming concern of Jewish exegesis since its very begin nings. And it is important to grasp that the philosophical pain that it caused was sharp and real, because it appeared to defy the notion of a</page><page sequence="7">JEWISH BODIES, JEWISH MINDS-WIESELTIER 441 single transcendent God, which was the foundation of the Jewish revolu tion in religion. Or are we to think that the subtlety of the Jewish concep tion of God was only the symbolization of the discomfort of the patriarchs with their bodies? Did God lack a tongue because Moses stuttered? Is the grandeur of the incorporeal God just a neurotic symptom ?the celes tialization of what we would call a body image disorder? I appreciate the thrill that the image of an incarnated God might afford Jews who have been raised on a deity so radically unlike themselves as to be inaccessible to them. But the pleasure must be enjoyed quickly, because the philo sophical sophistication of the God of the Jews, the Jewish fascination with incorporeality, is one of the most significant facts about the literary and cultural and religious history of the Jews. Insofar as the history of Jewish physicality scants the history of Jewish metaphysicality, it has everything backward. The Jewish body has been as much a site of ideological contestation as the Jewish mind. Medieval religious anti-Semitism and modern racialist anti-Semitism both seized upon the alleged carnality of the Jews; and in the modern period this played havoc with the self-respect and the self definition of many Jews, as historians have shown. If I appear intemper ate toward the somatist enterprise in Jewish historiography, toward what Boyarin calls "reading sex in Talmudic culture," it in part owes to my amazement at the apparent willingness of some Jewish scholars to affirm, and to elevate into a significant intuition about Jewish culture, certain prejudices about the Jews. Boyarin's stated aim is "to assert the essential descriptive accuracy of the recurring Patristic notion that what divides Christians from rabbinic Jews is the discourse of the body, and especially of sexuality" (CI, 2). He seems drawn to the Christian account. He agrees that Jews are highly sexed, essentially carnal, prisoners of matter. Where he differs from patristic authority, of course, is in his positive evaluation of the body. In his view, matter is not a prison. Not at all. Cultural materialism in Jewish studies, as elsewhere, conceives of itself as a great liberation. Thus, in a rather startling passage, Boyarin worries that "a major tendency haunting [my] work from the beginning has been a tendency toward a triumphalist comparison of Judaism with Christian ity in which Judaism emerges as pro-body or pro-sex, and thus healthier" (CI, 22). He seems to be worrying, in other words, that by accepting Christianity's version of Judaism he may be committing an injustice toward Christianity. For his intention is to transform an old Christian insult to the Jews into a modern academic compliment to the Jews. In the materialist environment of the American academy, beholding Israel according to the flesh is an exhilarating way of beholding them. The more</page><page sequence="8">442 JQR 95.3 (2005) bodily emissions, the better. What troubles me about the new scholarship on the Jewish body is its consistent refusal to identify, and to examine critically, the materialist faith at the heart of its enterprise. I cannot find any reason to accept its enthusiasm for the body as the central category of human experience. Daniel Boyarin would be surprised to hear himself described as the proliferator of an old anti-Jewish prejudice. "I do not wish to collaborate in domination" (CI, 228), he proclaims. He wishes merely to bring Jewish studies into the tender progressive embrace of gender studies. But his vocabulary is weirdly untender. Why should it matter, for example, whether the Jews are "healthier"? What does physical health have to do with spiritual or cultural vitality? Is Boyarin aware that this medicalizing discourse about Jewish culture was itself one of the primary instruments of domination during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries? Sander Gilman has documented in disturbing detail the role that physical standards for social and cultural judgment played in the development of modern anti-Semitism. But here is Boyarin, the emancipating scholar, who declares proudly that his scholarship is animated by his "desire to change ?in some small way ?the world" (CI, 227), trying to work out whether the Jews are sicklier than the Christians or the Christians are sicklier than the Jews. And it is the materialist premise of his work ? his "emphasis ... on the body as the very site of human significance" (CI, 6) ?that has brought him to such an unsavory place. The critical study of Jewish practices, of the physical actions and con ditions of Jewish men and women, existed long before the advent of cultural materialism, and in recent decades the scholarly inquiry into Jewish rituals and Jewish customs has reached extraordinary heights, all of them untouched by the history of the Jewish body. The materialists flatter themselves when they claim that they are restoring to Jewish stud ies a sense of Judaism's concreteness. What they are doing, instead, is undoing that sense of concreteness with an ideology, with an impoverish ing account of human thought and human action. The historiography of the Jewish body leaves one hungry for a moment of re-spiritualization, for a revival of the old conviction, which is once again a new conviction, that Judaism's mind has been more interesting and more influential than Judaism's body. The scholarly study of Jewish life is the study of ideas and their adventures in reality, or else it is just the anthropology of an other tribe.</page></plain_text>
