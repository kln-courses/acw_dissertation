In the United States, the Brücke artists are most popularly known for their prints, especially the woodcuts. The pro- liferation of Brücke prints that surfaced on the market after World War II ob- scured for a while genuinely fine items, but now collectors show increasing at- tachment to the early work, from the years when the Brücke shared a common studio and published group portfolios. The most famous Brücke members- Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Erich Heckel, Karl Schmidt- Rottluff, Max Pechstein, Otto Mueller, Emil Nolde- produced literally hundreds of prints during the seven years they worked together. Only a few are prime documents of European expres- sionism. These select works have a con- cisely bracketed history- most date 1909 to 1913- and a history that has been fal- teringly told many times, usually by con- noisseurs with all the right feelings but not all the right facts. There are reasons. Much early work has been lost or exists in only a few rarely seen exemplars. Many scholars confuse the contrived spirituality in later narrative expressionism with the genuinely powerful nature mysticism in early Brücke work. Schmidt-Rottluff, for example, is still best known for his post- Brücke, pseudo- African woodcuts, though earlier he concentrated on broad and bare landscape. Heckel's work, too, is judged unfairly because his early work is again very scarce and because art historians, being literary first and visual second, lean heavily toward the later, more illustrative work characteristic of Berlin expression- ism. I hope to set the record straight with two articles, the first on the Brücke's achievement of a landscape expression- ism, the second on the genesis of the Brücke's first expressionist figure style. When Kirchner, Heckel, and Schmidt- Rottluff founded the Brücke in 1905, they vowed to create nothing less than a new German art. This ambition was ini- tially spurred by Jugendstil printmaking. Kirchner spent some time in Munich studying German variants of art nouveau; Schmidt-Rottluff learned a neo-Japanese woodcut manner. They all experimented with impressionist painting techniques. Around 1908, they imitated Van Gogh and Munch in a brave attempt to pump as much heat and light as possible into their studio subjects. During the summer months, they left their Dresden quarters for northern Germany and there sketched open fields and fishing villages. Other art- ists' associations had sought to generate a new expression from the northland sea and soil, most without spectacular suc- cess. The Worpswede group in Schleswig- Holstein was then partially active, but most of its members had lapsed into a Corot realism or a misunderstood, gray- green impressionism. They failed to grasp important pictorial issues raised by new French art. Perhaps more relevant to the Brücke in the north country was the 61</page><page sequence="2">Erich Heckel, Road Outside Rome, woodcut (29x38. 9cm), 1909. Courtesy Museum Folkwang, Essen. Blaue Reiter in the south, though they had not yet heard of each other, as both groups attemped to infuse their art with a modernist vocabulary that did justice to locale. The Brücke evolved their first orig- inal landscape manner outside the farm- ing community of Dangast, not far from Bremen. The chronology of this northland style can be easily charted: Schmidt-Rottluff invited Nolde to join the group and in the fall of 1906 went to see the older artist on his Alsen Island retreat, in the North Sea. From Nolde he learned how to ef- fect the transition from the seductively decorative Jugendstil to a more impas- sioned, more immediate encounter with nature in the raw. Nolde knew something of Van Gogh's Provence pictures and had already developed his own post-impres- sionist landscape style. He taught Schmidt- Rottluff sticky impasto technique. This helped loosen the Brücke's studio habits and encouraged plein-air sketching. For several years, Schmidt- Rottluff and Heckel worked together around Dangast, drawing and painting watercolors of goat sheds, plowed fields, marshy canals, peas- ants at work. Kirchner made his first sketching trip to Fehmarn Island, in the Baltic Sea, in 1908. Soon after Pechstein joined the Brücke he, too, headed north, to the fishing village of Nidden in East Prussia, and there reinvented Van Gogh before doing his first expressionist land- scapes. In mid- 1909 the Brücke artists jointly defined their first independent style and returned in the fall to Dresden, where in their studio they finished oil paintings and pulled prints of subjects drawn through the summer. In 1910 Nolde (he was no longer an official mem- ber but kept up personal contacts) went to Hamburg to do harbor and ocean scenes. After a few days on the wharfs, he made a famous group of etchings and woodcuts that were to be his most power- ful landscapes in the graphic media. The northland prints of the Brücke, then, form a remarkably cohesive body of work and deserve a closer look. The Brücke edged gradually toward expressionism in 1907, seeming for a while to settle for an updated impression- ism. Schmidt-Rottluff's crayon litho- graphs of that year typify this transition and are his first prints exploring the Dan- gast moor country. In these modest works, the evocative half-shadow and nuanced light of Worpswede painting is given new life. Scribbled tangles of line and broad smears of gray predominate over the definition of outline or form. The artist pushed the crayon around on its side to build up rich atmospheric veils imitating the loose surfaces of his Dangast oüs. The grayed tonalities in the Dangast lithographs evoke a moody twilight world quite unsuspected in the work of such a robust, outgoing artist. Rosa Schapire, lifelong friend and patron of Schmidt- Rottluff, records a dozen 1907 Dangast lithographs in her catalogue but unfor- tunately illustrates none and probably leaves out a few. The reprint of this book is not of much help, either, since illustra- tions are still absent, and one must go sleuthing through the printrooms of the Berlin Brücke Museum, the Hamburg Kunsthalle, and the Staatsgalerie in Stutt- gart to see good examples. Most accounts of Brücke art make Kirchner the master stylist and the rest his imitators. True, Kirchner was an over- bearing personality and foisted his own symbols on Brücke friends, but it is equally true that Schmidt- Rottluff and Heckel were during the early years more Erich Heckel, Road Outside Rome, reedpen and ink (18x21 cm), 1909.

The ink and pencil sketches Kirchner did on Fehmarn Island in 1908 (in the Karls- ruhe Staatliche Kunsthalle and the Stutt- gart Staatsgalerie) are still heavily in- debted to Van Gogh and to impressionist vision. More important for the group's first expressionist graphics are the water- colors Schmidt-Rottluff and Heckel painted in 1909 around Dangast. Working out of doors, they dashed out freely improvised, Fauve-like compositions, then integrated this same easy fluidity into their other work. Heckel's water- colors- several are in the Oldenburg Landesmusuem, not far from where they were painted- inspired designs for some of his first expressionist woodcuts. For these, the wood was vigorously scored, leaving ragged edges and scattered splin- ters that print as rough, textural surface. Heckel virtually attacked the block and inked it heavily. His Dangast prints go beyond the suave woodgrain and trans- parent effects in the prints of Gauguin and Munch and record a more immediate sensation of the paper being forcefully pressed on the block. Schmidt-Rottluff was no less physical in turning the soft wooden block into a roughhewn relief. His woodcut style re- flects this desire to treat materials individ- ually: work printed from a woodblock should look printed from a woodblock. This is the big art-historical punch to early Brücke graphics, and the litho- graphs, too, use a thinned-down turpen- tine technique to record the crumbling edges of the stone and to give the print an appearance it could only get from that particular stone surface. The Brücke felt motivated to discover within each print media a way of working that would unequivocally express the physical attri- butes of the block, the stone, or the metal plate. This ideal probably finds its genesis in the late 19th-century arts and crafts movement- preaching and occa- sionally practicing the "honest" use of materials. The other side to the Brücke print- making aesthetic, to take their early work in its entirety, is rough finish and speed 62</page><page sequence="3">of execution. Important in realizing this ideal was a new speed of cutting to bring a sketchlike rapidity to printmaking proc- esses. Schmidt-Rottluffs woodcut Dangas t looks as if it were carved in a flash from the subject, though in fact it derives from his broadly washed water- color-and-brush drawing style of 1909. There is even a particular drawing in the Brücke Museum that established the basic layout. Wavelike formations in the fore- ground of the print suggest the artist might have painted a design on the block before hacking it out. This certainly was the way he proceeded in his Jugendstil work, though by 1909 he probably worked more like Nolde, who preferred to make only the most cursory sketch on the block in pencil before going to it with a short knife and wide gouge. The best early Brücke woodcuts have the final appearance of being literally sketched in wood. Schmidt- Rottluff was the first Brücke artist to fully realize a splintered, "cut up" quality in his woodcuts, and this attitude later became a virtual trademark of the German expressionist movement. His tendency to define massive outline Kirchner dubbed "monumental impres- sionism," though Schmidt-Rottluff had outgrown French influences by 1909. He moved gradually from a linear, calligraph- ic definition of space to planar organiza- tion; in the woodcut Dangast , ragged patches interlock on a flattened surface. The rude shapes Schmidt- Rottluff ab- stracted from nature and transferred to the block are among the most radically reduced images in German art of the period. For a while, at least, he was a mover in the European avant-garde. But Schmidt-Rottluff's formal ad- vances approached but never entered the realm of abstraction. His art, even during its most simplistic phase, always mirrored primordial nature. Black-white contrasts in his Dangast prints read like bleached- out hotspots and deep shadows, as if darkness approached at noonday. Gradu- ally a nocturnal veil falls over his work, culminating in 1912 in a brilliant series of moonlit scenes of Hamburg and Nor- wegian coastal villages. This poetry of darkness stands apart from the sunlit color in Heckel's and Kirchner's work and betrays a northern sensibility that has marked German romantic landscape since the early 19th century. Another moody symbol Schmidt- Rottluff inherited from German romantic painting is the tower, a subject that ap- pears like a recurring dream in his early woodcuts and oils. In the prints, this primal shape rises from amorphous foli- age and stands out as a foreboding sign. For the artist, the tower was a heroic presence, at times anthropomorphic, at times an extension of pure landscape. Though he was not keen on infusing heavy doses of literature into his work, the drama of these compositions depends in part on the associations they evoke. As in Feininger's work, church spires sym- bolize human aspiration, and a neo- gothicism lingers in Schmidt-Rottluff's graphics well into the 1920s. Heckel extended his Dangast style on a trip to Italy in the fall of 1909. Returning to Dresden with watercolors and pen sketches, he produced oü paintings and prints not dissimilar to contemporary Fauve work. For his Italian subjects, he thinned out oüs to watercolor-like consis- tency and attempted to translate his scratchy, angular reedpen style directly to woodcut. The integration of all the art- making processes- drawing, painting, printmaking- became a major preoccupa- tion with the Brücke, and their 1909 wooducts are the first evidence this atti- tude was starting to fulfill their larger goal: the creation of a new German art.

Courtesy Brücke- Museum, Berlin. and Schmidt-Rottluff's woodblock prints is the single most compelling reason to place them in the mainstream of early 20th-century modernism. Under their influence, Nolde also took up the wood- cut. In 1910, he, too, had gotten beyond the Jugendstil silhouette style and onto more powerful ways of graphically en- livening the block surface. At the time he was perfecting his Japanese brush draw- ing, and his Hamburg harbor prints reflect both the intentional crudity of his friends' work and the traditional elegance of Sumi art. Nolde's attitude toward the woody potential of the woodblock image was not a constant, but in his Fishing Steamer and Large and Small Steamer , woodgrain as such predominates over woodgrain as metaphor for smoke or waves. Shattered passages approximate large brushstrokes, and even in his wood- cuts, he remains first a painter, second a draftsman. Other members of the Brücke took up the "woody" blockprint. Pechstein pro- duced milder, more clean-cut examples, though his 1909 work is strongly indica- tive of the group style. A series depicting sailboats at Nidden have the same free cutting and strident zigzags as Heckel's contemporary work. Pechstein was aca- demically trained as a decorator and often retreated into the safer territory of post-impressionist design, but he also brought to the group a lighter sensibility that he learned from the Fauves during a short stay in Paris. Even Otto Mueller, who joined the Brücke in 1910, did a few woodcuts in a simüar vein before formu- lating his mature style. The painterly richness of early Brücke woodcuts springs from a long communion with the German countryside and is made consistent by what today would be called a process attitude. Nolde chose wood for its malleability; soft pine seems to have been his favorite, even though this often dictated a short run, since only a few prints could be pulled before the fragile parts of the design would start to deteri- orate. A similar judgment is more diffi- cult with Heckel and Schmidt-Rottluff- two world wars have almost totally de- stroyed all early blocks- but a few surviv- ing examples confirm what is already evi- dent from the prints. Irregular blocks of wood, frequently discards from the ends of planks and pieces with nonparallel edges, were accepted readymade. These are "shaped" prints, executed long before shaped canvases became a historical ne- cessity. Splinters gouged up were ripped off abruptly, creating notches at one end and striated surfaces beneath. Pechstein commented on how he proceeded after he selected a suitable preparatory sketch: The board gouge is used next to transfer the preparatory drawing to the surface of the block. The coarse grain of the wood begins to exert an influence on the cutting. Finally, with the short cobbler's knife, and without the drawing to work from, the hands move 63</page><page sequence="4">so much more easily, cutting into the sur- face with as much freedom as using pencil on paper. The blunt planarity and rugged sur- faces of the Brücke's northland landscape prints diminished after 1912, when class- icizing tendencies gave birth to a second, more mannered expressionist style, in which line predominated over mass. The 1909 prints owe much of their potency to the rather equal space allotted to black and to white- later the black was pared away, flecks in white areas cleared, and woodblock printing again became servant to line drawing: the great period was re- grettably short.
