<plain_text><page sequence="1">PHILOSOPHICAL TOPICS VOL. 18 NO. 2, FALL 1990 The Origin and Nature of Metaphysics Dudley Shapere Wake Forest University I THE ROOTS OF METAPHYSICS One of the great contributions of classical scholarship has been to show how the technical vocabulary of early Greek philosophy was derived from everyday, practical language. Eric Havelock, one of the most recent and creative in a long line of scholars who have dealt with such origins, has described the process as one of "stretching" those everyday concepts (as used in Homer and others of a "preliterate" tradition). Among the philosophical terms whose roots Havelock so traces are ones "such as space, void, matter, body, element, motion, immobility, change, permanence, substratum, quantity, quality, di- mension, unit, and the like."1 Again, suggestive parallels have been noted between early Greek philosophical doctrines and prior myths.2 When these insights of classical scholarship are placed in a wider context of scientific results, they assume a new and deeper significance, for in the light of the best scientific knowledge we have available, such everyday origins of philosophical ideas and their precursors in every- day experience are naturally to be expected. A number of disciplines 163</page><page sequence="2">have made us understand how, as with all biological species, early human beings and their hominid ancestors were faced with an envi- ronment with which they had to come to terms. They had to satisfy the need for food and shelter, for sexual and communal relations, and for protection from hostile agencies, both living and non-living. It was an environment always presenting challenge, often inspiring terror and - perhaps only with the appearance of Homo sapiens sapiens - beauty and awe. The human mind and all its products emerged from such mundane pursuits and pressures, and, given our understanding of the fact of evolution, it was only from dealing with them that our ideas could have originated. Though hidden in the obscurity of the archaeological record, the origins of myth and religion are also now widely understood as having had similar roots in attempts to come to terms with the world experienced in everyday life through, for exam- ple, stories about the origins of people and of things important to people.3 So it must also be with other ideas, even when those ideas involve more than can be captured through associations with single words. This essay will examine one such concept (or set of concepts), that of existence, in the larger context I have described. The embodiment of more primitive and vague ideas is very evident in two doctrines about existence put forth in Presocratic thought. These two doctrines, which were highly influential competitors in later philosophical and scientific thought, will provide a background for the discussion which follows. (1) Vague conceptions of the nature of the living, as active agency, as opposed to the inanimate, as purely passive, appear widely in early myth,4 and attribution of the human characteristics of agency and purpose to nature is a well-attested feature of primitive conceptions (anthropomorphism and animism in the broadest sense). It has been cogently argued that Milesian philosophy still conceived of nature as alive.5 It has been convincingly argued that this is no accident, but that these Milesian ideas derived from those more ancient ways of thinking.6 Somewhat purified and altered, the concept of active agency reappeared in the philosophical ideas of Heraclitus, Anaxagoras, Plato, and the Stoics, and found its fullest expression in the meta- physical doctrines of Leibniz. (2) Again, a deep impression must have been made on the emerg- ing primitive mind by the uncertainties of life. Fears of such unpre- dictability and uncontrollability, and unexpressed primitive wishes for permanence and control, must surely have arisen and become deeply rooted in the emerging human mind. In the philosophy of Parmenides, permanence is made the central feature of ultimate reality, as well as an ideal of what understanding (or control) should consist in. Though 164</page><page sequence="3">that view continued to be deeply influential in the subsequent history of philosophy and science, its appeal must have been heavily affected by those more primitive attitudes regarding the permanent and the impermanent, for the arguments of Parmenides and his successors were too weak to establish the conclusion that permanence is a neces- sary characteristic of ultimate reality. That weakness is also made ev- ident by the appearance and historical influence of a directly contrary view, that of Heraclitus, according to which the fundamentally of change is emphasized. That doctrine also must have arisen from more primitive sources, perhaps in the very uncertainties which gave rise to the Parmenidean view. There is, of course, little in the way of evidence for any specific source of early ideas about what it is for something to exist; such proposals are speculative. Nevertheless, they are not merely specula- tive, for they are proposed in the light of our best presently available knowledge about human evolution .7 Given the massive evidence that human beings (and their minds) evolved from a more primitive state in which environmental pressures were all-important, the ultimate or- igin of ideas, if not their justification, must have been in primitive everyday experience. When taken together with the further arguments to be given below, this knowledge implies that there simply is nowhere else to seek the origins of human ideas than in the primitive circum- stances of our species and its precursors. Thus it does not matter that, in the case of most of these ideas, we are unable to trace specific primitive roots with the confidence of classical scholars. II METAPHYSICS AND MODERN SCIENCE We no longer live in the world of primitive experience of early human beings. The primitive everyday impressions, fears, and hopes from which a multitude of views about the origins and natures of things emerged have been transformed in later history into a variety of con- flicting theories, philosophies, and attitudes. Nevertheless, despite those changes, the descendants of those primitive ideas retained crucial aspects of their original associations with the realm of everyday ex- perience. This is nowhere more evident than with the focal concept of classical metaphysics, the concept of existence. As the study of "Being as such," metaphysics was concerned with the requirements that are or must be satisfied by anything in order for that thing to exist (or be real), as opposed to being merely possible or 165</page><page sequence="4">to being impossible. This issue, of the nature of existence, was supple- mented by more specific questions regarding the nature of particular types of existent things, for example, concerning the distinction be- tween matter and mind and the nature of each, and of the character- istics of individual objects, both fundamental and derived, both men- tal and material. Here I will focus on the more general issues. Traditional metaphysicians offered a wide variety of detailed views about the nature of existence, among them the competing notions examined above, that the fundamentally existent must be unchanging and that it must be intrinsically active. Nevertheless, there were some suppositions, often tacitly assumed as self-evident, that were common to all or most of them, for whatever the details of a particular theory of existence, they held in common the following premises. 1. There is a fundamental distinction between the actual and the possible, the set of actual things (objects, processes, events, or whatever) being a subset of the set of possible things. 2. That which is possible but non-actual (non-existent) can have no causal influence on the actual (existent). 3. Every real entity must have one and only one determinate value of every property it possesses. (Every real thing that has the property redness must have a specific shade of redness; every ob- ject must have a specific and precise volume, position, direction of movement, and so forth.) Although these three premises are not found in the earliest views about existence, they become more and more explicit in later thought. For example, the view that fundamental existents must be active, and the view that they must be permanent, were central to the controversies between Cartesians, Newtonians, and Leibnizians in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries regarding the "Mechanical Philosophy of Nature."8 But common to both those views, and playing crucial roles in the debates, were the first two of the above premises. As to the third, it was incorporated into the structure of the classical physics whose emergence and interpretation was associated with those debates. Within the framework of the best results of modern science, it is easy to conceive, in the general but circumscribed way discussed above, how these three assumptions must have arisen from features which would have been fundamental to primitive experience. The sub- liminal origins of a distinction between the actual and the possible would have lain in creatures which had evolved the capacity of applying prior experience to current situations in order to anticipate alternative dangers and take alternative actions. Further, to such creatures, it would have been real predators that had real effects. Finally, such creatures would, in some non-conceptual sense, have attributed specific 166</page><page sequence="5">characteristics to specific objects in their environment, a tendency which would have increased with increasing sophistication and with the development of means of communication. That these three prem- ises have continued to be retained in many quarters (especially among philosophers) will be seen shortly, when we examine the discomforts felt at the results of quantum theories, and the interpretations of those theories which have been adopted to alleviate those discomforts. The fact that such metaphysical ideas had roots in the primitive does not by itself imply that all versions of them are incorrect (or, on an alternative view, that they are not necessary conditions of human thought). However, much of the philosophical tradition tended to argue that they, or some versions of them, were either correct, or necessarily correct, or necessary conditions of human thought or experience. But the fact is that, prima facie, all three of the above premises about the characteristics of the existent , and of the distinction between the exis- tent and the possible , have been abandoned in contemporary quantum theories . Prima facie, at least, the second premise is violated in quan- tum theories, a circumstance particularly important in contemporary quantum field theories. There, it is necessary in principle to bring into a calculation every possibility that can occur in the situation being discussed. This necessity is revealed in a striking way in the path- integral approach to quantum theories, where every possible path from an initial to a final state contributes to the calculation of the value of a predicted quantity.9 Such calculations (which in practice can be car- ried out with arbitrary accuracy) have proved their necessity in a long series of successful predictions of quantum theories, giving results which agree with experiment to remarkable numbers of decimal places. This fact, the influence of all "possibilities," is not a feature peculiar to a particular approach to calculations. It is an integral and funda- mental characteristic of all quantum theories. It is central to modern theories of the fundamental forces of nature and is, indeed, a conse- quence of the uniquely quantum-theoretic principle of superposition.10 Premise 1 also falls: the sharp classical distinction between actu- ality and possibility appears, prima facie, to be violated in contem- porary physics, for, if all possibilities have physical effects, where is the distinction between possibility and actuality? Finally, premise 3 is violated. To every classical property, there is a corresponding quantum property ("observable"), but a quantum state can be a superposition of states possessing every possible value of its "observable" properties. I have spoken of these violations as prima facie for we have yet to ask whether they are to be accepted as such. Indeed, these features of quantum theories have seemed to many thinkers so unpalatable as to require being rejected or avoided in some way. The great successes 167</page><page sequence="6">of quantum theories preclude their being rejected, and so, such think- ers hold, they must be reinterpreted. A common way of doing this is by denying that the relevant concepts of quantum theories refer to any entities whatsoever, actual or possible, and by asserting that, on the contrary, they are mere calculational devices. (For example, the sum- ming over possibilities would be viewed as a purely mathematical de- vice for obtaining an expectation value.) At least part of the motiva- tion for such a view lies in the supposition that there is some requirement or set of requirements which must be satisfied in order that a theoretical concept can be "realistic" and which is not satisfied by the concepts in question.11 Clearly, the three premises stated above are included among those requirements: the distinction between pos- sibility and actuality, and the dictum that no real thing can have su- perposed values of a single property, seem too firm to reject. But it is at precisely this point that the perspective developed in Part I of this essay becomes relevant. According to that perspective, our conceptual apparatus, including our views about what properties something must have in order to exist, was originally framed in the light of mundane facets of the experience of our primitive ancestors. If this is so, then this particular argument against a "realistic" inter- pretation of quantum theories is not valid. Concepts springing from such origins, framed to meet the practicalities of everyday experience, need not hold beyond that everyday level of human experience, where "levels" is, in the light of contemporary scientific findings, to be un- derstood in terms of such variables as energy, size, and velocity. (The fundamental point was already understood by the founders of twenti- eth-century physics, though they did not put it in the larger context of our understanding of human evolution.) The apparent firmness of these concepts, their immunity from rejection, is anthropocentrically based. They cannot, therefore, be used as criteria forcing a certain kind of interpretation and excluding another kind. Further, the enormous success of contemporary quantum field theories ought to give pause to anyone wishing to deny their signifi- cance by subjecting them to conditions of "reality" which they do not satisfy. The success of modern quantum field theory is embodied in the contemporary "Standard Model" which embraces the electromag- netic, weak, and strong forces and their associated particles.12 That success consists partly in the fact that (apart from gravitational phe- nomena, which are covered by general relativity) there is no experiment or observation, from the smallest observed events (on the order of 10" 16 centimeters) to the largest cosmological scales observable, which is incompatible with that theory. It also lies in the fact that, when that theory is applied to cosmology, it provides the basis of a history of 168</page><page sequence="7">that universe from approximately 10" 35 seconds after its beginning (i.e., after the breaking of the symmetry between the strong and elec- troweak interactions) to times many orders of magnitude longer than the present age of the universe. Such theories must be taken seriously. Doing so means asking not, "How can those theories be fitted into our preconceptions?" but rather "How should our preconceptions be altered in the light of those theories?" (And so, my fellow philoso- phers, ask not what you can do for quantum theory; ask what quantum theory can do for you.) This is not to say that concepts which have evolved from everyday ones must necessarily be altered or rejected, or even that they will be. Just as the applicability of such concepts beyond the everyday level is not self-evident, so also their inapplicability is equally not self-evident; they, or some of them, might continue to hold. Nevertheless, we should have learned by now that we must consider it possible that they may be violated. It is a commonplace that modern science has in fact vio- lated two ideas, classical determinism and Euclidean geometry, which had been held to be necessarily true of nature. Other ideas, though having recognizable antecedents, have been altered in very fundamen- tal ways. The concepts of matter, force, space, and time, traditionally assumed to be wholly distinct, are now, in altered forms, being fused, their distinctness being explained as a feature of our cold universe.13 1 have also argued that even what count as "observation" and "expla- nation" are altered in the light of the results of scientific inquiry.14 It is thus at least possible that similar changes, perhaps even more pro- found, may take place which force us to depart still further from what must be viewed as a limited human perspective about what it is for something to exist. Ill IMPLICATIONS OF THE PRESENT VIEW Thus an important lesson of contemporary physics is that, through scientific investigation, we are learning how our concepts must be al- tered in order to deal with the universe in which we live. Here I have argued in particular that we are or at least may be learning what it is for something to exist: that quantum theories (especially more recent quantum field theories), rather than failing to satisfy preconceived ideas about what it is to exist, may well be teaching us something about what it is to exist. The suppositions of classical metaphysics must be seen as having been shaped by the dictates of everyday exper- 169</page><page sequence="8">ience. Though in the process of their development they have departed from the mundane quality of their primitive origins, they still bear the marks of that origin. The far more radical departures forced by mod- ern science are, from this perspective, a further step in the deanthro- pomorphism of nature. These are things that we have learned, and we have also learned that we are learning these things. There is a deep irony in this story. Logical positivists were fond of arguing that metaphysics goes beyond experience, and is therefore meaningless. It is science, they maintained, that keeps within the con- fines of experience, of the observable. But according to the view pre- sented here, the situation is exactly the reverse. It is metaphysics which, in its doctrines about the nature of existence, has remained all too close to experience, in the sense of everyday experience and the prim- itive roots from which our present everyday experience arises; it is science which has transcended those limits, both in what it studies and in the concepts it devises to deal with that broader realm. The roots of the positivist error are not hard to find, for positivists never offered a decent analysis of what is involved in "observation" (observability); indeed, they left the concept of observation (or of observation-lan- guage) essentially unanalyzed. More specifically, they never appreci- ated the ways in which science builds on what it has learned, using what it has come to accept as knowledge to develop new techniques of gaining access to information and extending the concept of observation to include new types of evidence, newly described in terms of the background of accepted knowledge.15 Thus it has gained access to new realms of experience, ranging far beyond the levels of size, velocity, energy, etc., that are found in everyday sensory experience, to say nothing of "sense-data." Nor did the positivists appreciate the ways in which the development of mathematics serves as one means by which new concepts, going beyond everyday experience in radical ways, are developed for dealing with those realms of experience.16 Although in general those realms transcend the sensorily-observable, they are nev- ertheless observable in senses which depend on what we have learned - senses which positivism, with its narrow restriction of the evidential and meaningful to the sensory, could not appreciate. It therefore failed to grasp the magnitude of scientific transformation and, in the process, misconstrued the role of metaphysics. However, if classical metaphysics was misrepresented by its logical positivist critics, it was also misconceived by its own practitioners; for though the latter argued that metaphysical truths do or even must hold of all experience, we must now realize that those supposed truths were gleaned from the everyday and evolved therefrom without ever shed- 170</page><page sequence="9">ding important vestiges of their ancestral roots.17 In the light of what we have learned through inquiry, the task of metaphysics must hence- forth be to see those doctrines in the light of a larger picture of the development of human inquiry and its results: as parts of a historical process of which the histories of philosophy and science are an integral part. That task must involve attempting to understand (within the framework of our best available scientific results) how classical meta- physical doctrines could have arisen and evolved from the everyday, to understand how at least some of them have had to be altered in order to gain a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of a universe of which human sensory experience is only a minor part, and to call attention to the possibility that other classical metaphysical doctrines may also need to be changed as our inquiries into that universe extend still further beyond the scope of the human senses. The view for which I have argued in this paper raises two final points. The first has to do with the question of whether there are "eternal problems of philosophy." The supposition that there are has been deeply embedded in the approach of philosophers to understand- ing the nature of knowledge and reality, for it has been supposed that questions such as "Do knowledge-claims attempt to describe reality?" can be framed in such a way that they can be asked of any scientific theory (or knowledge-claim) at any time and that the first step in answering such a question consists in framing the necessary (and also perhaps the sufficient) conditions for saying that something is "real" ("is actual," "exists"). But all our concepts, including even such fun- damental ones as those of "existence," "object," and "possibility," are subject to change in the light of the results of inquiry. This open- ness to alteration and rejection is brought out most incisively if we place our inquiries in the context of the best such results that we have available: results which imply that even such concepts are descended from dealings with an everyday world and retain much of those prim- itive limitations to an everyday level. The very formulation and con- ception of problems of understanding must be continually revised in the light of new findings. This brings us to the second and final point. I have said that our inquiries must be conducted within the framework of the best results we have attained in the knowledge-seeking enterprise: that our philo- sophical problems must be formulated in the light of scientific knowl- edge; that the best results of scientific inquiry must be both the object of our philosophical inquiries and the framework within which those inquiries are conducted. I take it that this is what "naturalistic" meta- physics and epistemology are really, or should be, all about. 171</page><page sequence="10">NOTES 1 . E. A.

For example, the Milesians seem to have held that things are not made of water, air, or the Indefinite, as Aristotle read them as saying, but rather that they arise from one or the other of those. Anaximenes seems to have held that air was a living, active agent: "... that which has intelligence is what men call air, and by it everyone is directed, and it has power over all; for it is just this substance which I hold to be god."

Perhaps a distinction should be made between (mere) speculation and hypothesis, the latter being formulated within the framework of prior rationally-accepted belief ("background knowledge"). Then, of course, hypotheses are not, as Popper sup- poses, mere conjectures, presented without reason, but are themselves developed in the light of a background of reasons. 8. D.

A more familiar method of calculation, though less general in its application and therefore less fundamental in the insight it provides, is the use of Feynman dia- grams to calculate the probability of occurrence of a final state &lt; f | given an initial state |i&gt;. Here too, every possible process which can connect the two must, in principle, enter into the calculation. Each such process can be represented by a Feynman diagram, with which is associated mathematical expressions describing the wave functions of the particles involved. In the case of electromagnetic inter- actions (quantum electrodynamics), in practice only the first few "orders" (deter- mined by the number of vertices) of diagrams - i.e., the most important possible processes - need be considered. This is because, in such interactions, the effects of processes of successively higher "orders" are reduced by a factor of 1/137. How- ever, this possibility of ignoring higher-order processes does not lessen the fact that those possibilities, infinite in number, all make contributions which are rele- vant to the calculation. 10. The situation is frequently described in terms of "virtual particles," which are portrayed as "popping in and out of existence" too quickly for their violation of the principle of conservation of energy to be serious (i.e., their "existence"is constrained by the time-energy indeterminacy principle AEAT &gt; fí). However, this way of characterizing virtual particles contains several errors, of which one is especially relevant to the present topic: the characterization is highly misleading if it is supposed to imply that only if such a "virtual particle" is somehow "actual- ized" at a crucial moment will it have an effect. All "virtual possibilities" contrib- ute to the total effect. Any reading which considers the possibilities to be "popping in and out of existence" is simply an imposition of old concepts of the distinction between possibility and actuality. 172</page><page sequence="11">11. Another important motivation for an "anti-realist" interpretation of quantum mechanics lies in the fact that an appropriate measurement of a physical quantity will result in that quantity having precisely one value of that quantity. Thus, it is sometimes held, quantum theories are concerned only with "observables" whose values are found by measurement. This gives rise to a problem (the "measurement problem"); however, since the measurement process is not included in the funda- mental equations of quantum mechanics or its field-theoretic extensions, those theories themselves have the features of superposition which I have discussed. Are those theories (most generally, the theory known as the Standard Model) incom- plete? Certainly the Standard Model, the furthest extension of quantum theory, is incomplete in a sense that may turn out to be very relevant to the measurement problem, for, though it is highly successful in its predictions with regard to the electroweak and strong interactions, it does not incorporate an account of the fourth fundamental force, gravitation. (In other words, quantum theory is not unified with general relativity, the space-time theory of gravitation.) Many of the problems of understanding quantum theory have to do with questions related to space and time; thus the measurement problem, in at least one guise, raises the question of how a "spread-out" quantity can be instantaneously localized by a process of measurement. Similarly, the experiments concerning Bell's theorem may be taken as indicating that we do not understand what it is for something to be a localized, independent "object." One must suspect that resolution of such difficul- ties, rather than being a matter of proper "interpretation," may have to await a unification of our best theory of space-time - general relativity - with the increas- ingly unified quantum theories of the other forces of nature. 12. The background, constituents, and problems of the Standard Model, and further directions of theoretical research in contemporary physics, are discussed in D. Shapere, "The Universe of Modern Science and Its Philosophical Exploration," Philosophy and the Origin and Evolution of the Universe , eds. E. Agazzi and A. Cordero (forthcoming). The term 'model' should not be misconstrued by philo- sophers: the Standard Model is a paradigm case of a "theory" in physics. 13. This point is discussed in D.

For observation, see D. Shapere, "The Concept of Observation in Science and Philosophy," Philosophy of Science (December 1982): 485-526. For explanation, "Modern Physics and the Philosophy of Science," op. cit., and "The Mechanical Philosophy of Nature," op. cit. Again, what are altered in those cases are concepts whose ancestors emerged from dealing with the pressures of everyday primitive existence. Note that the permanence and activity which have been viewed as re- quirements of the fundamentally real have also been held to be requirements of any fundamental explanatory concept. 15. The ways in which the concept of observation is extended in the light of scientific findings are described in detail in D. Shapere, "The Concept of Observation in Science and Philosophy," op. cit. 16. D. Shapere, "On the Introduction of Radically New Ideas in Science" (forthcoming). 17. It is true that many metaphysicians have claimed that their concepts apply to a realm beyond experience. However, the concepts which are thus applied are them- selves pretty obviously ones of ordinary experience, perhaps sharpened or extended in ways that leave their ordinary roots still showing. Thus, for example, Plato declared that there is a Realm of Being, of "Forms" or "Ideas" which are fulfilled only approximately by things in the spatiotemporal world. But typical examples we are given of them include the Ideas of Humanity, Equality, Good, Beauty, Circlehood, and Being itself - concepts whose roots in human efforts to deal with their experience are manifest. Given such examples, Plato should be viewed as I have suggested: that certain concepts developed on our level of experience are 173</page><page sequence="12">adequate to describe a reality behind experience if those concepts are extended or refined in certain ways. This is not to say that Plato fails to give arguments for this view (e.g., that everyday concepts are unusable unless we have a prior knowl- edge of the extended or refined versions); but those arguments do not hold up (which version of a concept is ideal?) and cannot be taken seriously in the light of what we have learned about the development of human thought. In addition, it is a further assumption to claim that a reality beyond experience is understandable in such terms, even when refined. BIBLIOGRAPHY Burkert, W.
