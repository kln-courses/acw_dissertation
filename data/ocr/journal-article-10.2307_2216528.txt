The merits of these six books are already so well known to readers of The Philosophical Quarterly that they do not require to be reviewed at length in these pages. Dialectical Materialism and Science. By M. CORNFORTH. (Marxism Today Series, No. 7). (London: Lawrence &amp; Wishart. 1949. Pp. 63. Price 1/6).

(London: Sheed &amp; Ward. 1950. Pp. x + 490. Price 18s). A welcome photographic reprint of a book long recognised as a classic in its field. The Living Thoughts of Gotama the Buddha, presented by A. K. COOMARASWAMY and I. B. HORNER. (London: Cassell, The Living Thoughts Library. 1948. Pp. x + 224. Price 6s). Out of the Labyrinth. By A. HANSON. (London: Sidgwick &amp; Jackson. 1947. Pp. 142. Price 8/6). In this imaginative work there is grouped round the leitmotif of the bull-cult in its various manifestations a series of episodes depicting some of the main phases in the religious history of mankind-totemism among hunters and pastoral peoples, the tension between gods of the corn and of the herd, the development of anthropomorphic gods and the emergence of invisible spirit-deities. Each pair of episodes is separated by a poetical intermezzo. The work draws upon modern anthropological classics and upon ancient material as diverse as the Minos legends, the Babylonian service of the poet Alcaeus, and the Biblical Deutero-Isaiah, here called Nathan. The attempt to impose a structural unity upon the scattered material is not quite successful, but the treatment is sym- pathetic and on the whole well-informed, the presentation vivid and the style at once noble and lively. A. M. H. Die Lehre vom Charakter, 2nd Edition, enlarged. By R. HEISS. (Berlin: de Gruyter. 1949. Pp. viii + 240. Price RM. 12). Introduction a la Philosophie de l'Histoire de Hegel. By J. HYPPOLITE. (Paris: Riviere, Bibliotheque philosophique. 1948. Pp. 98. Price Frs. 125). This is not a summary of Hegel's Philosophy of History but a sketch of the gradual process whereby he came to adopt its leading ideas. Evidence for this process is found principally in the Jugendschriften and the Jena writings, especially the essay on natural law. Hegelian scholars are already deeply in M. Hyppolite's debt for his work on the Phenomenology. The debt is increased by this remarkable essay which contains the most penetrating exegesis that I have seen of the conceptions of Volksreligion, positivity and fate, the ground themes of Hegel's work at Tubingen, Berne, and Frankfurt. Nor is the book only for specialists; it is an admirable initiation to the Hegelian arcana. T. M. K. The Drama of Atheist Humanism. By H. de LUBAC. (London: Sheed &amp; Ward. 1949. Pp. x + 253. Price 15s). Outline of a Metaphysic. By F. J. MATCHETTE. (New York: Philosophical Library. 1949. Pp. xvi + 108. Price $3.75).

Price DM 2.75). Zum H6chsten Dasein. Goethes Faust im Lichte der Schopenhauerschen Philosophie. By KONRAD PFEIFFER. (Berlin: Walter de Gruyter &amp; Co. 1949. Pp. 109. Price DM. 3.80). This is the third edition of an agreeably written book first published in 1937. The author is well-known as a writer on Schopenhauer. While there is an obvious parallel between Schopenhauer's Wille zum Leben and the Faustian urge, it must remain doubtful whether the best way to treat PFaust philosophically is to look at it in the light of a later philosopher. Stubborn Soil: an Exploration into Problems of Experience. By SETON POLLOCK. (London: Sidgwick &amp; Jackson. Pp. viii + 191. Price 12s 6d). This book is not, as its sub-title might suggest, an epistemological or psycho- logical enquiry. The ' problems of experience ' are the lessons of life crystallised in the 'wisdom' literature of the Biblical Hebrews, and the 'exploration' is the author's very personal and somewhat discursive exposition of what he regards as a neglected body of writing. As a serious contribution to the under- standing of that corpus it is of slight significance; its chief service will be to</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 95 preachers in search of modern instances and racy-though sometimes remote- illustrations. A. M. H. Lavoratore nell Universo. By M. M. Rossi. (Rome: Edizioni Leonardo. 1947. Pp. 136. Price L. 300). Kant und K6nigsberg. By K. STAVENHAGEN. (Gottingen: Deuerlichsche Verlags- buchhandlung. 1949. Pp. 104. Price DM. 5.80). The most familiar character sketches of Kant are drawn from information about his old age. This monograph, however, gives us a vivid picture of the Konigsberg which Kant knew as a Privat-dozent, especially of the Russian occupation from 1758 to 1763, and we are introduced to a Kant whose social life engrossed much of his energies and was an integral part of his being. He was no dry as dust scholar, because " he never forgot how to live." The book is well illustrated (there are two early portraits of Kant and four old engravings of KSnigsberg) and it is so charming and delightful, as well as scholarly and instructive, that it must be warmly commended to all those whose interest in philosophy does not exclude an interest in philosophers. T. M. K. On the Resolution of Science and Faith. By W. THOMAS. (New York: Island Press. 1946. Pp. xii + 300. Price $3.50). An essay in scientifico-religious monism. Why shouldI kill myself ? By THOMAS VEITCH. (London: Skeffington. 1950. Pp. 156. Price 4s 6d). PERIODICALS: The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science. Vol. i, No. i, May, 1950. Pp. 76. (Edinburgh and London: Thomas Nelson &amp; Sons). Price 7s 6d. This new quarterly journal, edited by Dr. A. C. Crombie, is assured of a warm welcome from students of philosophy. Its sponsors regard it as most undesirable that the extended application of science to practical affairs should be accom- panied by loss of apprehension of its philosophical significance, and their aim in this journal is to induce scientists to reflect on their own work and to strive to understand its meaning. The journal's distinctive character will be the examina- tion of scientific problems in the light of wider philosophical considerations. The journal thus hopes to make a contribution to that understanding of the powers, the limitations, and the essential character of Science which is necessary if men are to be masters of Science instead of its slaves.
