<plain_text><page sequence="1">Studies in the Philosophy of Religion, partly based on the Gifford Lectures delivered in the University of Edinburgh in the year 1923. By A. SETH PRINGLE-PATTISON, LL.D., D.C.L., F.B.A., Emeritus Professor of Logic and Metaphysics in the University of Edinburgh. Oxford, at the Clarendon Press. 1930. Pp. vi q- 256. 12s. 6d. net. ONE may doubt if the title of this book is the most apt to describe its contents or to enable it to find its way into the hands of the class of readers to which it should be most valuable, viz., students of Christian dogmatics and of the history of the development of religion along the line which culminates in Christian theism. To these students in particular Prof. Pringle-Pattison has rendered a great service. He has supplied them with a concise and critical discussion of the origin of religion and some of its most elementary forms, in the light of modern anthropology, of the process by which the con- ception o.f the tribal God of the Hebrews was transformed by the prophets into that involved in an ethical monotheism, of parallel processes otherwise occasioned in ancient Greece and Persia, of the ' apocalyptic background of the New Testament, and of the laying of the foundations of ecclesiastical doctrine in the apostolic age. From the large amount of material yielded by historical and comparative investigations he has extracted the facts and theories of which it is of first importance to take account; and the sense of proportion, the insight into what is most significant, and the wide theological learning which he manifests, distinguish his work as one of the best</page><page sequence="2">94 CRITICAL NOTICES: of its kind. In one respect it is of a unique kind; for while there are many good books covering parts of the subject-matter dealt with in this volume, there is perhaps none which in a similar manner connects them into such a continuous whole. The author's exposition of the development of religion begins with a consideration of forthcoming views as to what was the most primitive form of religion and of the relation of religion to magic. He regards Tylor's theory, that religion arose out of animistic thought, as obsolete: neither ghosts nor demons were the first deities. Frazer's supposed age of magic or pseudo-science, preceding the dawn of religion, is rejected as mythology; and consequently no favour is shown to the view that men took to wheedling the superhuman powers by propitiation and prayer only after discoveringf the in- efficiency of magicians to control the course of Nature. Much that used to be referred to magic is nowadays ascribed-rather to religion. Religion is earlier than anlmism and, together with magic, arises in emotion excited by the occult and the awful. The most recent generation of explorers of the field of primitive religion, as represented by Marett, is credited with truer insight than its predecessors; and Prof. Pringle-Pattison agrees that the primitive religious object is no longer to be identified with spirit but rather with what, in virtue of its supposed life and power, possesses prestige and sacredness, as expressed in the positive term ' mana ' and the negative term 'taboo ' Durkheim's theory, according to which the religious object is merely a personification of the primitive society with its internal structure, is accounted insufficient in that it fails to explain the cosmological character common to religions, and cuts mankind loose from Nature: totemism contains the germ of the belief in Providence. Neverthe- less, religion is a social reaction, and the tribal god is the personified community, though also something more than it. The transition from theriomorphism to anthropomorphism, the author observes, is best traceable in the history of Greek religion; and to this he now turns. The Greeks became, in a sense, a peculiar people, different from the barbarians in that they came to read the superhuman not as the beast-like but as the human idealised. Greece also illustrates the evolution of monotheism through the stage in which Zeus is but a primus inter pares, recognising Moira as indepen- dent of himself, and onwards until in AEschylus he stands for moral government. In the main line of Greek philosophy from Socrates to Aristotle, with its endeavour to ground the laws of human conduct on the laws of the universe, monotheism became completely ethical. In a later chapter Zoroastrianism is also shown to have been, in the conception of its founder, an instance of the monotheistic outcome of speculation on the cosmic scale. Hebrew monotheism, on the other hand, is a development, out of tribal monolatry, conditioned by experience of national history, and may in essence be said to be a philosophy of history. The story of that evolution has been often told, but it loses none of its interest as</page><page sequence="3">PRINGLE-PATTISON, Studies in Philosophy of Religion. 95 retold in this volume, and is supplemented by a sympathetic account of later Judaism and the Law. The pages devoted to Jewish and Christian apocalyptic deal with a subject that will perhaps be less familiar to many students of divinity, but the author's treatment of it should show how indispensable is acquaintance with this by-way of religious thought for an understanding of the earliest Christian literature. The remaining chapters of the book are concerned with the first stages in the development of Christian doctrine. Their respective titles are: The Historic Jesus, The first Christians in Jerusalem, The Christology of St. Paul-St. Paul and Philo, Gentile Christianity and the Mystery Religions, The Fourth Gospel, and The Christ of the Creeds. It would be becoming only for a specialist in the depart- ment of New Testament theology to offer criticism as to points of detail dealt with in these chapters, and I am in too close agree- ment with the author's general conclusions to offer comment on them. I concur with his strictures on the kenotic theories by which one or two recent theologians whom he cites have sought to make the traditional Christology more intelligible, and I can only complain that at the last pages of his otherwise very lucid volume Prof. Pringle-Pattison becomes vague as to the final issues-the inter- pretation of the person of Christ and the exact meaning of 'revelation' as associated with His teaching. For instance, in a passage quoted (p. 252) with approval from Dean Inge, occurs the sentence, " surely Christ came to earth to reveal to us not that He was like God, but that God was like Himself'"; but the words " came to earth to reveal " seem but to restate, as if their non-technicality put them beyond question, the dogma which Prof. Pringle-Pattison has, in so far as its technical formulation is concerned, appeared to dismiss as unintelligible and involving the miraculous. Because the origin of the Christian revelation was not 'miraculous,' in the specific tradi- tional sense of that word, it was, he says, none the less the work of God in a human soul. And if one should ask on what grounds he entertains that belief his answer would seem to be that the message authenticates itself: " it ' finds ' us by its appeal to all that is best in us ''. Why what appeals to the best in us, or the highest that we needs must love when we see it, is true in the sense of being valid of reality-which is perhaps the question which the philosophy of religion is primarily concerned to discuss-is not here taken up. It would seem that such acceptance as Prof. Pringle-Pattison accords to Christianity is made possible to him only by an embracing of that pragmatist theory of truth which, within the sphere of religion, is confronted with the fact that imaginal and purely ideal objects, provided their actuality is believed in, can excite sentiments as efficacious in the spiritual life as those evoked by known actualities. In this connection a few words may be said as to the author's first chapter, on the meaning and scope of the philosophy of religion. Taking philosophy to be a synoptic view of things, we may speak, as</page><page sequence="4">96 CRITICAL NOTICES: he says, of a philosophy of any particular department of experience, such as law, art, or religion, as well as of philosophy as a whole, or of a philosophy of all the sciences, etc. A philosophy of a particular subject will consist in an analysis and interpretation of the experi- ence in question, in its bearing on our view of man and of the world' in which he lives. The philosophy of man's religious experience,, Prof. Pringle-Pattison continues, cannot but exercise a determining influence upon our general philosophical conclusions: " in fact with many writers the particular discussion tends to merge in the more general " (p. 1). This is doubtless so because many writers would say that a philosophy of' religion is not properly so called unless it' does concern itself, and concern itself pre-eminently, with the relation of religious belief to our general philosophical conclusions, or with the truth-claim of religious belief and its relation to certainty, pro- bability, etc. If this were not its paramount issue, a philosophy of religion would dwindle into a science of religion, and even into a department of anthropology. The latter identification would doubt- less be renounced by Prof. Pringle-Pattison; but he does not seem sufficiently to guard against being interpreted7as if he sanctioned it. He observes that the facts-supplied by the history' of religion, in the most comprehensive sense of that term, are the data of the philosophy of religion, and that pure history is not philosophy. But is it enough, if a philosophy of religion is to be distinct from a science of religion, to say (p. 2), " to achieve a philosophy of religion we should be able to discover in the varied manifestations a common principle to whose roots in human nature we can point, whose evolution we can trace . . ., as well as its intimate relations with the other main factors in human civilisation " ? It may be but a question as to the appro- priateness of names, but unless ' philosophy of religion ' means something more than this, and includes above all the epistemology of religious belief and dogma, it would seem to be a superfluous reduplication of the name ' science of religion '. For this reason some teachers are beginning to ban the phrase' philosophy of religion,' and to speak instead of philosophical theology, when they have in mind epistemological rather than historical or genetic questions. The nature of religious experience and its manifestations, and the historical development of religious beliefs and institutions, after all form but a part of the subject-matter of anthropology unless religion is concerned with questions as to the ultimate truth of things. Then only is it relevant' to philosophical problems and is philosophy con- cerned with it. To put the matter differently, there can be a philo- sophy of theology, but none of religion, as distinct from theology: i.e., there can be no philosophy of the historical manifestations of religious sentiment apart from questions as to the reality of the religious object evocative of that sentiment, and as to the truth of propositions concerning that object. Such questions are in some measure contemplated in the philosophy of religion as Prof. Pringle- Pattison describes it. But in associating philosophy of religion with</page><page sequence="5">ROBERT REININGER, Das TPsycho-physische Problem. 97 what is called the philosophy of history rather than with epistem- ology, and in regarding philosophy of religion as predominantly concerncd with the development of religion and its harmony with other experience, he conceives of his subject as more akin to a science of humanity, and less akin to the theory of knowledge, than -some philosophers would regard it. Hence the doubt, expressed at the beginning of thisreview, as to the aptness of the title of his interesting book. F. R. TENNANT.</page></plain_text>
