Paris: Editions de minuit, 1973. O times, In which the meagre, stale, forbidding ways Of custom, law and statute took at once The Attraction of a Country in Romance ... Wordsworth Not the least unexpected thing about the 1960's was its reinvention of the question of Utopia. "Meagre, stale and forbidding", the basic texts of the genre had been as desperately unreadable as those of obsolete forms like the masque or the mystery play, their content as irrelevant to con- sumer society as the draft constitutions and natural or contractual theories of the classics of political science. What had actually become obsolete, however, was a certain type of reader, whom we must imagine just as addicted to the bloodless forecasts of a Cabet or a Bellamy' as we ourselves may be to Tolkien, The Godfather, Ragtime, or detective stories. Such readers become extinct because the level of fantasy tolerance is suddenly modified by a change in social relations: so in the windless closure of late capitalism it had come to seem increasingly futile and childish for people with a strong and particularly repressive reality- and-performance-principle to imagine tinkering with what exists, let alone its thoroughgoing restructuration. Meanwhile, even among those with a commitment to social revolution, the classical polemic of Marx and Engels against Utopian socialism, which had long since stigmatized both the word and the thing itself, seemed reconfirmed by books like Charles Reich's Greening of America, whose "critique" of captalism (Consciousness I) proved on closer inspection to harbor the much more comfortable and reassuring conviction that the essentials of a hallucinogenic future were already latent and stirring, implicit in consumer society itself, and available at the price of one last effort . . . which however turned out merely to be an 1 "From 1886, the year of the Haymarket Riots, until 1896, the year of the restoration of conservative hegemony [.. .] over one hundred works of Utopian fiction appeared" [Jean Pfaelzer, "American Utopian Fiction 1888-1896: The Political Origins of Form," in The Minnesota Review, special issue on "Marxism and Utopia," no. 6 (Spring, 1976), p. 114). 2</page><page sequence="2">effort of "consciousness!" Meanwhile, Reich's minor premise, shared with so many of the post-1848 Utopias, had a much more serious political function, asserting, as it did, that whatever Utopia was and however it might be conceived, it was not to be construed as having anything whatsoever to do with Marxian socialism-which is to say, with any of the existing political movements for social change in the world today. Still, in comparison to poor Fourier, with his unanswered ad, the immense commercial success of Charles Reich's bestseller testified to the renewal of a demand for Utopian discourse in the 1960's. It remained for the greatest Utopian thinker of that period to suggest that, given the present-day's unparalleled technological possibilities for the satisfaction of needs, "if critical theory, which remains indebted to Marx, does not wish to stop at merely improving the existing state of affairs, it must accommodate within itself the extreme possibilities for freedom [. . .], the scandal of qualitative difference. Marxism must risk defining freedom in such a way that people become conscious of and recognize it as something that is nowhere already in existence" [Herbert Marcuse, "The End of Utopia", in Five Lectures (Boston: Beacon Press, 1970), pp. 68-69]. The history of the 60's testified to the correctness of Marcuse's strategic reassessment of the explosive political force, in that particular social and historical conjuncture, of the Utopian idea and the Utopian impulse, which are therefore not to be denounced out of hand in the name of Marx and Engels' reading of the quite different political conjuncture of the 1840's. That this was not only the opinion of the New Left may be judged by a remarkable observation of Georg LukAcs himself on the "unequal rate of development" of contemporary history: "We must essentially com- pare our situation today with that in which people like Fourier or Sismondi found themselves at the beginning of the nineteenth century. We can only achieve effective action when we become aware that we find ourselves in that situation and when it becomes clear to us that there is a sense in which the development from Fourier to Marx remains, both theoretically and practically, a task for the future" [Holz, KOfler, Abendroth, Gesprache mit Georg Lukdcs (Hamburg: Rowohlt, 1967), p. 93]. If indeed it is so that May 68, far from being our 1848, was little more than our July Revolution, then we must at least allow for the possibility of some revolutionary potential in Utopian works which, like their nineteenth century predecessors, prepare a distant and unim- aginable 1848 in a situation which does not even look like a pre-revolutionary one. What is at least certain-however we ultimately decide to evaluate the Utopian impulse itself-is that anti-utopianism constitutes a far more easily decodable and unambiguous political position: from religious arguments about the sinful hybris of an anthropocentric social order all the way to the vivid "totalitarian" dystopias of the contemporary counterrevolutionary tradition (Dostoyevsky, Orwell, etc.), Utopia is a transparent synonym for socialism itself, and the enemies of Utopia sooner or later turn out to be the enemies of socialism. The transition from the 60's to the 70's was a passage from spontaneous practice to renewed theoretical reflection, and this is as true in the realm of Utopian discourse as it is elsewhere. It is therefore no surprise that after the reawakening of the Utopian impulse of the previous decade, we should begin to witness the maturation of a whole new generation of literary Utopias, among them the most important Utopian text since the appearance of Skinner's Walden Two, namely Ursula LeGuin's The Dispossessed [New York: Harper, 1974]. It may be more paradoxical to suggest that the theoretical fulfillment of this Utopian practice is to be located-alongside the rediscovery and renewed study of the inexhaustible anticipatory "philosophy of the future" of Ernst Bloch-in the area of narrative analysis. Such a term will seem less confining, how- ever, when the multiple intersections of narrative analysis with the various specialized academic disciplines-literary semiotics, ethnomethodology, the anthropological study of myth and the historians' inquiry into the nature of historiography, even the dawning sense of the "narrative" structure of the experiments of natural science-are understood as blocking out the as yet empty space of a whole philosophy of narrative praxis in which the production of events and of the language that constitutes them promises to provide a more adequate conceptual framework than any of the older diacritics/June 1977 3</page><page sequence="3">purely epistemological systems, as well as the newer communicational ones. It is at any rate as a fundamental contribution to such a philosophy of narrative, as well as the most extended structural analysis of the Utopian impulse-the gesture itself as well as the genre-yet worked out, that we must read Louis Marin's Utopiques: Jeux d'espaces: This book, exactly contemporaneous with LeGuin's novel, and elaborated in the very eye of the hurricane during Marin's Nanterre seminar in May 1968, prolongs a meditation on the Utopian event itself-"revolutionary f6te [in which] for a few weeks historical time was suspended, institutions and the Law itself in its totality challenged in and by speech, communication circuits reopened between those who near or far were drawn within it" [p. 15]-until that event, slowly trans- muted into a text, at length becomes accessible to narrative analysis. The text thus reconstituted is however called Thomas More's Utopia,2 one of those rare works which, whatever its precursors, inaugurates a whole genre, which it names at the same time that it exhausts its whole range of formal possibilities. It will be most convenient to see Marin's approach to More in the Utopiques as the inversion of Levi-Strauss's widely known program for the "structural study of myth" [see the chapter so entitled in Structural Anthropology (New York: Basic Books, 1961), pp. 206-231]. For Levi-Strauss, myth is a narrative process whereby tribal society seeks an imaginary solution, a resolution by way of figural thinking, to a real social contradic- tion between infrastructure and superstructure (in the terms of his example of the Oedipus myth, between the tribal infrastructure of the kinship system, and the religious or cosmological systems that seem irreconcilable with it). L6vi-Strauss's relatively unsystematic essay suggests two methodological alternatives for dealing with myth, each of them however informed by the conviction that myth is essentially a process of mediation. In the more conventional second half of his presentation, indeed, L6vi-Strauss underscores the role of mediatory characters in the mythic narrative-ambivalent, androgynous, doubly coded figures such as the heavenly twins, the trickster, or the Cinderella/Ash-boy characters, who, by virtue of the reproduction of the antithetical terms of the contradictory situation within them- selves, are able to serve as the narrative occasion for the latter's seeming resolution. The originality of the first, lengthy and largely hypothetical example of the Oedipus legend was to have transcended these more anthropomorphic categories of the individual "character" (even when that character is a mediatory one), and to have proposed a kind of impersonal chemistry of narrative events themselves which de- composes the apparent unity of the individual characters into a bundle of signifying traits just as thoroughly as it dissolves the surface units of the narrative itself. As Utopia is in one sense the very prototype of the narrative without a narrative subject and without characters, the relevance of this second option will be evident. Marin's work suggests, however, that we may now specify Levi-Strauss' approach to myth even more sharply, for it becomes clear that the latter understands mediation essentially as an operation bearing on the two "primary" terms of the fundamental contradiction or binary opposition itself, terms we may write for convenience as S and -S: MEDIATION S -A -s But Greimas and others have taught us that this is far from exhausting the logical possibilities and permutational combinations inherent in the simplest binary opposi- tion; not only do the logical contradictories of S and -S furnish two more indepen- dent terms, but the various axes thus generated (negative and positive deixis, impli- cation, contradictions) suggest that even the most rudimentary "elementary struc- 2 All page references herein are to the edition of Edward Surtz, S. i. [New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1964]. 4</page><page sequence="4">ture of signification" (as Greimas calls his "semiotic rectangle"3) is capable of generating a number of quite distinct "mediatory" combinations alongside the one operative in L6vi-Strauss's mythic resolutions, designated in Greimas's system as the complex term C: C,(Complex term) N (neutral term) This logical schema then permits us to identify at a glance the quite different position Marin assigns the Utopian narrative; it is for him the structural inversion of myth in this sense, that where the narrative operation of myth undertakes to mediate be- tween the two primary terms of the opposition S and -S, and to produce a complex term which would be their resolution, Utopian narrative is constituted by the union of the twin contradictories of the initial opposition, the combination of -S and S, a combination which, virtually a double cancellation of the initial contradiction itself, may be said to effect the latter's neutralization and to produce a new term, the so-called neuter or neutral term N. In what follows we will give a good many examples of this process, not only in order to give content to what may otherwise seem an extremely abstract proposition about the nature of Utopia, but above all to demonstrate the ways in which this hypothesis about the function of the Utopian operation may serve as a practical method for the reading and the analysis of the texts themselves. Before going any further, however, it is worth underscoring the polemic implications of such an ap- proach, and, in particular, its relationship to that debate on the nature and ideologi- cal function of representation which is one of the key problems in contemporary literary theory. The problem of representation may be understood in its simplest form in the context of one of the most fundamental of all methodological options or alternatives which face us when we try to confront language or linguistic phenomena. Humboldt already gave striking expression to this option in the Romantic period when he evoked the twin faces of speech as energeia and as ergon, as creative power and as object created-something like a natura naturans and a natura naturata (Spinoza) in the linguistic realm itself, and two wholly different modes available to us for constru- ing any given individual verbal fact or entity. This alternation (which should not too hastily be assimilated to Saussure's opposition of langue and parole) has then proved to be a powerful instrument of analysis in the form given to it by present-day linguis- tics as a distinction between cnonciation and cnonct, between the act of enuncia- tion and the completed utterance.4 When now we introduce the whole question of representation into this scheme of things, and suggest that a linguistics of the cnonc or of the ergon will tend essentially to grasp linguistic objects as representations, while a stress on the crea- tive or process-like character of language will tend to undermine representational 3 See A. i. Greimas and Frangois Rastier, "The Interaction of Semiotic Constraints," Yale French Studies 47, special issue on "Game, Play, and Literature" (1968), pp. 86-705; and also Frederic Nef, ed., Structures 6lmentaires de la signification [Brussels: Editions Complexe, 1976]. 4 The Austin-Searle concept of a "speech act" would appear to belong in the category of the 4nonc6, an already completed and successful transmission of meaning; the confusion this concept sometimes gives rise to is probably attributable to the ambiguity of the term "act", which has led people to try to assimilate it to the opposite category, of praxis and production, of the emergence of meaning. See Stanley Fish, "How to Do Things with Austin and Searle: Speech Act Theory and Literary Criticism", Modern Language Notes Vol. 97, No. 5 (October, 1976), pp. 98-025. diacritics/june 1977 5</page><page sequence="5">categories, we will have begun to glimpse the ideological coordinates of the prob- lem. It remained for Julia Kristeva to assimilate this linguistic distinction-better still, this distinction between two possible types of linguistics, two whole approaches to the study of verbal and literary phenomena-to the classical Marxian one between the exchange value of commodities in a market system, and their use value in pre- or post-capitalist social forms. The primacy of the first of these phenomena imposes a mode of analysis in which categories of exchange are dominant, whether this be Marx's own study of the operation of surplus value and money in mature capitalism, or a linguistics ideologically related to communication theory and to the perspective of an exchange of completed "speech acts": "from the viewpoint of social distribu- tion and consumption, and indeed, that of communication as well, work is always a value, whether of use or of exchange. In other words: if in communication values are always and inevitably grasped as fragments of crystallized work, [from this perspec- tive] work itself can represent nothing above and beyond that value in which it is crystallized" [Julia Kristeva, "La Semiologie: Science critique et/ou critique de la science", in Thdorie d'ensemble (Paris: Seuil, 1968), p. 88]. But as Kristeva points out, there is implicit even in the Marxian analysis of capitalism the logical and historical possibility of a very different approach to economic phenomena, and one which suggests a quite different alternative for the study of language as well: "an other space is conceivable in which work may be apprehended independent of value as such, a space that precedes the manufacture and circulation of commodities in the circuit of communication. There, in that place [scrle] in which work as yet represents no value and is not yet 'intentional' [ne veut encore rien dire], in other words, as yet has no meaning, in that other space it can only be a matter of the relationship between the body and systems of energy [d&amp;- pence]" [Ibid.]. As is well known, Kristeva goes on to propose a "semiology" based on production to replace, or at least to coexist with, the older "semiology" of com- munication and representation. This is not the place to explore the inflection given this program by the work of the Tel Quel and the Screen groups. Suffice it to say that in this society, we can only fitfully break the habit of thinking in terms of finished commodities (reification [see Georg LukAcs, "Reification and the Consciousness of the Proletariat", in History and Class Consciousness (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1971), pp. 83-222; and, for a theory of reification in consumer society, Guy Debord, La Socidth du spectacle (Geneva: Buchet/Chastel, 1967)]) along with the habit, so closely related to it, of reading according to categories of representation. Whatever the possibilities, there- fore, for some genuinely post-representational discourse (or "textual productivity", as Kristeva calls it), we must take a keen interest in those literary or textual phenomena which reveal the tenacity of the hold of the older representational categories on our own thinking and reading: and this is the context in which Marin's Utopiques has a particularly striking lesson for us. To understand Utopian discourse in terms of neutralization is indeed precisely to propose to grasp it as a process, as energeia, enunciation, productivity, and implicitly or explicitly to repudiate that more traditional and conventional view of Utopia as sheer representation, as the "realized" vision of this or that ideal society or social ideal. Nowhere, however, does this seem more instructively difficult to manage than in the reading of a text whose tours and interminable guide-book explanations, whose static descriptions of institu- tions and geographical and architectural layouts, seem intent on establishing beyond any possibility of doubt or fluctuation the representational coherence and solidity of its object. Marin's book will then have as one of its fundamental tasks to convince us that it is possible to understand the Utopian text as a determinate type of praxis, rather than as a specific .ode of representation, a praxis which has less to do with the construction and perfection of someone's "idea" of a "perfect society" than it does with a concrete set of mental operations to be performed on a determinate type of raw material given in advance which is contemporary society itself, or rather, what amounts to the same thing, to those collective representations of contemporary society which inform our ideologies just as they order our experience of daily life. 6</page><page sequence="6">Yet the disparity still seems very great between this description of a literary text as a set of mental operations, let alone as neutralization, and our incorrigible ten- dency to incorporate the Utopian text back into that more conventional category of novels or narratives in which characters travel and do things and stable landscapes, kingdoms, powers and principalities "exist". It may thus be useful to try to reduce it by indirection, and to point out some of the unexpected advantages presented by this view of narrative as process, in particular a solution to that old (false) dilemma of an "extrinsic" criticism, sometimes erroneously thought of as the problem of the referent, that is, of something "real" somewhere outside the text to which the latter supposedly makes--or better still, fails to make-allusion. If, however, we try to accustom ourselves to thinking of the narrative text as a process whereby something is done to the "real", whereby operations are per- formed on it and it is in one way or another "managed" (Norman Holland) or indeed "neutralized," or under other circumstances articulated and brought to heightened consciousness, then clearly we will have to begin to think of the "real," not as something outside the work, of which the latter stands as an image or makes a representation, but rather something borne within and vehiculated by the text itself, interiorized in its very fabric in order to provide the stuff and the raw material on which the textual operation must work. In the case of the Utopian narrative, the place of the Real--of that which must first be constituted within the work before it can be dissolved or "neutralized" by the work as process-may be identified by the obsessive references to actuality which seem part of the conventions of such texts, the perpetual play of topical allusion throughout the narrative which, intersecting the more properly diegetic interest, is constantly on the point of fragmenting the text into an anecdotal and discontinous series of vertical indicators. Thus, for example, if it is true that Gulliver's capture of the Lilliputian fleet, along with the ensuing dip- lomatic negotiation, "has reference to the Treaty of Utrecht, which, effected by the Tories, ended the war with France" [Jonathan Swift, Gulliver's Travels, edited by Robert A. Greenberg (New York: Norton, 1970), p. 36, note 1], then Swift's text ought rightly to become an object of scandal for those of us still committed to the ideology of an "intrinsic" criticism (the practitioners of an older kind of literary history would have had no trouble with such a passage-their own difficulties lay elsewhere-while those advancing "beyond" the New Criticism have yet to confront the problem of political allegory head-on, let alone the problem of allegory in general and as such). Still, there is reason to believe that such footnotes are not the mere cobwebs of topical and long-dead contemporary allusion to be brushed desperately away by the living reader, but rather that some such play of topical allusion is structurally indis- pensable in the constitution of the Utopian text as such and provides one of the distinctive traits necessary if we are to mark the Utopia off from its generic neighbors in the realm of fantasy or idyll. A regressive pastoral like W.H. Hudson's A Crystal Age (1887), while it certainly shares Utopian features with the classical works in the genre, is distinguished from the latter primarily by the absence from it of any of those one-to-one allusions-generally in the form of inversions-which make the reading of Utopias a process of allegorical decipherment. So in Butler's Erewhon, machines are evil and illegal precisely because in Victorian England industrial prog- ress is an ideological value presupposed in advance and uncontested; but Hudson's return to some earlier pre-capitalist form-whether savagery or barbarism-is an appeal to a generalized and global nostalgia, rather than to a precise set of decoding operations. What is this but to say that, unlike Utopia, this kind of idyll or fantasy is precisely a representation and musters its narrative resources in order to impose the fullness of an image of a different form of life, an image the fascinated contemplation of which includes both anxiety and longing within itself? The Utopian text does not generally strive for such hallucinatory intensity, and on the contrary usually merits our complaints about its transparent literalism and its unimaginative and allegorical aridity. Its topical allusions, however, if they constitute an essential feature of the genre's structure, are nonetheless not without problems of their own, which will then take us far in understanding the nature of Utopian diacritics/June 1977 7</page><page sequence="7">production. For if the text requires this network or texture of topicality within itself to stand as that Real which it will undertake to neutralize, it is at the same time menaced by the wealth of allusions to current events which threatens to dissolve it altogether. All genuine Utopias therefore betray a complicated apparatus which is designed to "neutralize" the topical allusion at the same time that it produces it and reinforces it. So, for instance, Ursula LeGuin's novel The Dispossessed seems at first glance a fairly straightforward and unproblematical transposition and fictionalization of the contemporary division of our globe today between the so-called Free World (in her book, the wealthy planet Urras) and the socialist bloc (its barren and rev- olutionary satellite Anarres). This identification is then further confirmed for the reader by Shevek's introduction to consumers' goods and consumerism during his visit to Urras: thus he has to learn the word for "packaging", since the practice does not exist on his own world [176]; his trip to the downtown luxury shopping area is a virtual nightmare [116-117]; at length the very revulsion with commodities becomes a figure for Urras itself: "it is a box [.. ..] a package, with all the beautiful wrapping of blue sky and meadows and forests and great cities. And you open the box, and what is inside of it? A black cellar full of dust, and a dead man" [305-306]. No less transpar- ently are the problems Shevek faces in his homeland-his difficulties in publishing his scientific discoveries, the conformist atmosphere of the scientific institute in which he is attacked for lack of patriotism, the attempt to prevent him from receiving a prize from "propertarian" Urras-read as stereotypical allusions to recently pub- licized restrictions on intellectuals in the Soviet Union. Indeed, the very convention- ality of such allusions and the transparency of the novel's basic opposition between the reification of consumer capitalism and the political constraints of socialism-far from being a flaw in LeGuin's novelistic vision-on the contrary define the very specificity of our reading of her Utopian text. To put it a different way, it is only in terms of a more conventionally novelistic and more properly representational stan- dard of literature that her book can be reproached for the poverty of its political concepts and the naivet6 of its view of present-day world history; if on the contrary we adopt Marin's view of the Utopian as process and production, we will see that it is precisely such stereotypicality, and the conventionality of LeGuin's own liberalism, which constitute the raw material upon which her Utopian praxis must do its work of transformation. This said, we must observe that such topical reference to the contemporary situation is no sooner posited than it is undermined by a new system of topical allusions incompatible with it. We discover indeed that our initial identification of the twin planets themselves with the "Free World" and the "socialist bloc" becomes difficult to sustain in view of the fact that this division is itself reproduced all over again, but with much greater detail, within the framework of the planet of Urras alone, where, alongside the capitalist state visited by Shevek, there turns out also to be a kind of Soviet Union, represented by the centralized state socialism of Thu, and, in addition to both, an impoverished sub-continent (Benbili) in which the two great superpowers intervene and which we therefore conclude by identifying as our own Third World. Nor does this particular process stop here: soon even this system of correspondences-once set in place-is discredited by the revelation that within LeGuin's imaginary cosmography, in the intergalactic league (the Ekumen) to which the binary planets of Urras and Anarres themselves belong, the real Earth still exists, a burnt-out shell, its ecology blasted by war and pollution and surviving only at the price of a regimentation qualitatively different from that of revolutionary Anarres, whose beneficient scarcity and "clean" austerity it therefore reflects back in the negative image of a baleful and toxic waste land. At this point, clearly, it can no longer be a question of deciphering the appropriate references so much as of specifying the nature of the apparently contradictory process at work in them. For this approach and withdrawal of LeGuin's important novel from its systems of reference, these identifications with a topical subtext which are also and simul- taneously differentiations from it, betray the presence of an essential mechanism at 8</page><page sequence="8">work in all Utopias. In the original one, for instance, topical allusion takes the form of a ghostly double or phantom England that rises up behind the no-place of the island of Utopia in the text, a tangible but intermittent historical nation-state to which the scholarly footnotes, pursuing the chitinous whisper of their commen- taries, make insistent reference, reconstructing it as a sub-text even as they under- mine the last chances of the narrative surface to achieve any "full" representation. But such "explanations"-"the island contains fifty-four city-states" because Tudor England had fifty-three counties, plus the City of London [More, p. 61, note 7]; the Andrus runs sixty miles to the sea because "the Thames 'doth twise ebbe and flowe more than lx. miles' within twenty-four hours" [p. 64, note 2]; the butchers of Utopia work outside the cities because of " 'an Acte that noe Butcher slea any maner of beast within the Walles of London' " [p. 78, note 4], etc., etc.-are not to be deplored as the excesses and misguided zeal of some now discredited ideal of literary-historical scholarship; but rather understood as the fitful and symptomatic expression of a referential sub-text which is an essential and determinate absence or "other" within the structure of the Utopian text proper. In later Utopias, it would seem that this phantom spatial superposition of More's Utopia with the "real" England contemporary to him is rearticulated in time, and in some sense rationally justified or "motivated" (in the meaning the Russian Formalists gave this word) by the emergence of a wholly new element, namely history itself and the new bourgeois sense of historical change and evolution. Now the Utopian text is not figuratively established across its referential sub-text, but rather literally founded and edified on the latter's historical emplacement; and the narrator of Looking Backward finds a new and more perfect Boston on the site of the old noisy and dirty nineteenth century industrial metropolis of the same name, while the visionary sleeper of News from Nowhere is astonished to discover that "England's green &amp; pleasant fields" have supplanted the endless precincts of the grimy London of old. Only now Bellamy and Morris are under an obligation to provide a historical account of the transition from old to new, or rather from reality to Utopia; and it is here that, with their denunciation of the Utopian socialists' overemphasis on sheer reason and persuasion and their failure to grasp the antagonisms of political and social dynamics, the founders of Marxism lie in wait for them.5 For Marin, however, the historicity of the great nineteenth-century Utopias- which might otherwise, whatever the political oversights of their authors, have seemed to mark some progress in relation to the ahistorical vision of a Thomas More-may equally be taken as a sign of mystification, and as the repression of some more genuine Utopian praxis, insofar as it strains to fill the chinks of the representa- tional surface and to plaster over the basic structure of Utopia as a non-place and a process of neutralization with the fuller image of some historically realizable and positively imaginable society. This is the sense in which, for Marin, after the elabora- tion of historical materialism as a rational mode of conceptualizing human society, Utopias as such are no longer possible, or in other words, that Utopian practice ceases to be an authentic mode of thought; we will return to this assertion shortly. It is now time to introduce an initial demonstration of the central proposition of Utopiques, namely that the basic relationship of the Utopian text to what we have been calling its referential sub-text is one of neutralization; or, in terms of More's Utopia, that the island of that name functions as a point-by-point negation or cancel- ling of the historical England itself. When we remember, however, that this latter entity is to be understood as a sub-text, itself constructed (and then neutralized) by the Utopian text itself, we will understand that such a proposition is not to be understood in some banal sociological sense. Rather, it is here that Greimas' Semiot- s It may be conjectured that, after some interrogation, they will allow Morris to pass by. See for an important reconsideration of the relationship of Morris (and bevond him of the Romantic tradition) to radical and revolutionary thought, Edward Thompson, "Romanticism, Utopianism, and Moralism: the Case of William Morris," New Left Review 99 (September-October 1976), pp. 83-111 (reprinted as the "Postscript" to William Morris, Romantic to Revolutionary [New York: Pantheon, 1977]). diacritics/june 1977 9</page><page sequence="9">ic rectangle has a strategic function to play, by allowing us to construe "England" (or rather "Portugal", its historical ally and surrogate in More's text and Hythloday's own country of origin) precisely as a complex term, as the combination or imaginary synthesis of the basic contradictions of More's time: to this complex term would then reply the echo of the neutral or Utopian one opposite it. For the moment, however, we can only show this in an external, and as it were geographical way. As a "place" on the globe, indeed, "England/Portugal" may be said to know two specific contradictories each quite distinct from each other: op- posed, on the one hand, by the New World, which is not the old one in all the ways enumerable by the Renaissance imagination and elaborated by Renaissance hopes, and on the other by Asia, which is also not Europe, and very particularly not England, but according to a very different socio-historical conceptual system; and these two contradictory terms constitute something like a positively and a negatively charged opposite of England/Portugal respectively: Portugal / Ceylan Equateur Amnrique Figure 6. - Structure dcs toponymes des voyages de RaphalI. Hythloday's discovery of Utopia mid-way between the America in which he has been left during the final voyage of Amerigo Vespucci, and the Ceylon which at length he reaches on the journey home, is therefore the enactment of a complicated figure in which'both of these two already negative terms are negated in their turn: Portugal B A vs B Ca cutta A nicrique Sens de ,a transformation eylannA Portugal-&gt;Am drique..,Ceylans-.Calcutta_;Portugal A vs non-A Figure 2.-- Schemas du voyage de Raphail. ago 657 Calcutta , / Ceylan Portugal Ceyf~f An/ ,,tie -. // / - , Figure S. - Schemnua complexe du recit de voyage de Raphail. 10</page><page sequence="10">This is however the very fulfillment of the neuter or neutral term itself: "We know that the blessed isle is located between Ceylon and America, but also that it stands outside the toponymic circuit and outside the trajectory that runs from world to anti-world. It will thus combine---beyond all space--circumference and diameter, time and space, history and geography, in a place which will be neither a moment of history nor a sector of the map, a place which will be sheer discontinuity [6cart]-a neuter-where alone the island can become manifest once the travel narrative has demonstrated the perfect equivalence of the two poles equidistant from it: homologous with Portugal and England, belonging to the same hemisphere as Ceylon and America, but distinct from all of these, neither anti-world, nor New World, but simply World other" [Marin, p. 71]. So far we have been content to grasp neutralization as something like an objec- tive process in its own right, as an "event" that happens to a preexisting structure, or better still, as a restructuration that takes place through the text itself. But of course this is itself only a figure of speech, and looked at more rigorously what we have been calling "neutralization" is a feature, not of the text itself, but rather of our (Marin's) model of the text. We must now therefore draw back a step, and try to understand the mental operations involved in the construction of such a model: to do so, we will temporarily suspend Marin's reading of More, interpolating a simpler and somewhat more dramatic contemporary illustration drawn from a later chapter of the Utopiques that deals with the "Utopia of verticality" of the composer-architect lannis Xenakis. The reference is to the so-called "cosmic vertical city" imagined by Xenakis in 1965 [and published in Urbanisme, utopies et rmalitLs, edited by Francoise Choay (Paris: Seuil, 1965), pp. 335-342] in the form of a two-mile-high self-enclosed building of a type not unfamiliar in other contemporary images of the future (readers of Science Fiction will for example recall Robert Silverberg's account of daily life inside just such a vertical "utopia" in his novel The World Inside). Yet to attempt a narrative exploration of such a future "society" would be to reconfirm the representational status of a verbal construction such as that of Xenakis, or in other words, to misuse the Utopian text by shifting the focus of our reading from process to the inert end-product of some static Utopian image or "vision". In this sense Marin's chapter-indeed, as we have already seen, the Utopiques in their entirety-is less an analysis of the Utopian text than it is a set of directions for the latter's "bon usage," prescriptions for reading and instructions for the appropriate application of the text to the Real. The example of Xenakis will demonstrate that it is less revealing to consider Utopian discourse as a mode of narrative, comparable, say, with novel or epic, than it is to grasp it as an object of meditation, analogous to the riddles or koan of the various mystical traditions, or the aporias of classical philosophy, whose function is to provoke a fruitful bewilder- ment, and to jar the mind into some heightened but unconceptualizable conscious- ness of its own powers, functions, aims and structural limits. Utopian praxis "is thus, to use Kantian terminology, a schematizing activity of the social and political imagi- nation which has not yet found its concept" [Marin, p. 211]; yet such pre-conceptual thinking-in-images-which has its affinities with the dream, with L&amp;vi-Strauss' mythic thinking, or Hegel's notion of the Vorstellung as a figural stage of Absolute Spirit- can only be observed in action when we construct a model in which the problems it blindly attempts to solve themselves become visible. In the text of Xenakis, it is clear that this problem is at one with what may loosely be called the contemporary ideology of the city. But as literary analysts, we cannot start from this starting point of the text itself, for only the text exists before us and the ideological contradiction it came into being to "solve" remains to be (re-) constructed. Our first task as critics, therefore, is to project a contradiction, or in other words a set of binary terms, a conceptual opposition, such that the literary or figurative text before us may be grasped or reread as the "resolution" (myth) or the diacritics/June 1977 11</page><page sequence="11">"neutralization" (Utopia) of the hypothetical opposition thus posited. Obviously, described in this way, the interpretative process seems to break into two separate steps or stages; and it is clearly artificial and unrealistic to suppose that the interpre- ter has no idea where he or she is going, no preliminary intuition of the form such a reconstructed contradiction is likely to take. Still, it is useful to stress the process of reconstruction itself, as a corrective to the naive idea that the analyst or the historian can gaze into some "objective" realm of social or national or political ideology and there empirically discover the solution to his structural problem. Ideology does exist objectively, but not in the form of a text: like the unconscious it is therefore not directly accessible to us, but only insofar as we have reconstructed it in what has today come to be called "textual" form, with which the literary text can then be placed in an active relationship of reaction, transformation, reflection, repression or whatever. To omit the description of this stage-the reconstruction of the referential sub-text, the hypothetical textualization of ideology-is to perpetuate the illusion that "sociological" analysis is something one can add on to a structural analysis of texts or not, as one's own temperament dictates. In the case of Xenakis, we may feel somewhat freer in our reconstruction of that underlying, absent, social text to which his own Utopian project is a response, insofar as its basic raw materials are very precisely our own anxieties and stereotypes about the contemporary city. Our point of departure for such a reconstruction is the nature of Xenakis' u-topia itself, the fundamental features of that ultimate not-place or non-place which he invented to neutralize the contradictions of contemporary thinking about the city. We must therefore try to reorganize the latter in such a way as to articulate our own ideology of the city, our own fuzzy stereotypes and fantasies, into a system of determinate antinomies and aporias into which the thought of the Western city-dweller about his city can be seen to be locked. Xenakis' project, and Utopian discourse in general, will not exactly be understood to be a coming to consciousness of such antinomies and contradictions: it cannot yet be thought to be critical in the sense in which the Frankfurt School so described that distantiation and heightened awareness of contradictions afforded by the negative. Still, at some lower, still pre-conceptual level, the "neutralization" of such a contradiction by Utopian discourse may nonetheless be supposed to bring the mind up short before its own ideological limits, in a stunned and puzzled arrest of thought before the double bind in which it suddenly finds itself paralyzed. The principal anxiety we have about the city today can probably be best expressed in terms of sheer urban concentration: here the stereotypes of Science Fiction usefully document the unconscious agoraphobia of contemporary bourgeois con- sciousness, with its monitory images of overpopulation and its clogged dystopias of all kinds. From a diachronic perspective, this fear of urban concentration is clearly a twentieth-century variant, a coded or "sedimented" persistence, of that older, ideologically far more transparent, nineteenth-century terror of the mob itself, the revolutionary crowd, which such anxieties thematize in terms of looting and arson, of damage to property (Scott, Manzoni, and Dickens offer rich dramatizations), but whose real credentials for menace are to be sought in the great revolutionary "days" of 1789-1794. What interests us in the present context is that this anxiety-fantasy about urban concentration represents a profound structural reversal of the older bourgeois concept of the "freedom of the city" which developed during the revitali- zation of city life in the high and late middle ages: from this ideological perspective, the city was the place where you went to shake off the constraints of village life, or, even more fundamentally, those of serfdom and the feudal order. Such an ideal of the "free" city is thus at one with the initial strategies of legitimation of capitalism and of the market itself, and the individualism it promises was closely related to the civilizing, beneficent effects of that "douceur du commerce" celebrated by the ear- lier ideologues of free enterprise. This earlier ideal of the city as a place of individual freedom is therefore at one with the emergence of "individualism" as such and of the bourgeois subject: its negation by the nightmarish visions of concentration in the mid- and late twentieth 12</page><page sequence="12">century-as in those thronged bodies passing the night indoors on the staircases of the apartment buildings of a privileged elite in the twenty-first-century Manhattan of Soylent Green-may be expected to be less a reversal of the ideology of indi- vidualism than a confused and figural coming to the surface of the latter's internal contradictions. For meanwhile, in some other register of our minds and at some other level of collective representation, the city has a quite different ideological function to play and serves as the support for an ideal quite antithetical to that of bourgeois indi- vidualism, lending its content to visions of perfected community or collective exis- tence from the image of the Heavenly City of Christian eschatology all the way down to the conception of the Commune itself. These two quite different ideologies-that of individualism and that of collectivity-are no doubt in the normal run of things able to coexist without any great discordance in that vast lumber-room of stereotypes and fantasies which Althusser calls the id4ologique, since ordinarily they serve different functions and are wheeled out for different purposes and on different occasions. But in a crisis their structural incompatibility becomes clear, and the fundamental contradiction about capitalism that they express (the paradox of a col- lective social form organized on the basis of individual profit) makes its presence felt as a conceptual antinomy. We may dramatize it most simply by observing that the solution most appropriate to assuage the individualistic terror about urban concentration-it is, obviously enough, the idea of decentralization-turns out at one and the same time to cancel out that other fundamental vocation of the city to stand as the locus and the figure of collective life. It should be added that the distinction we have made here between a contradic- tion in the social infrastructure and the form it takes when it becomes registered in the realm of thought and ideology, or in the superstructure-namely the antinomy-is an essential one, which is crucial if we want on the one hand to refute the reproach of a Hegelian idealism sometimes extended to Marxism itself, and on the other to propose a more adequate solution to the problem raised by the insis- tence of contemporary historians like Michel Foucault on the fundamental discon- tinuity of epistemes as they succeed themselves in "history" [Les Mots et les choses offered a catalogue of such epistemic discontinuities, while The Archeology of Knowl- edge proposed their theory]. This insistence-and the attack on linear and continu- ous, "idealistic" historiography that accompanied it-sprang from the conviction that ideology is a closed system, that a given episteme is not something that can be modified or developed or "resolved" or "aufgehoben" according to the conven- tional stereotype of the Hegelian dialectic; but rather that it generates all of the logical possibilities and permutations implicit in its structure and is then abandoned, a new episteme gradually taking its place. It is for this reason that we have couched our own description of ideology in terms of antinomies rather than of contradiction, for the latter, subcellared in the deeper structures of mental life, must be under- stood as betraying its operations through those surface clicks and malfunctionings in which the former consist, and which serve to signal an approach to the conceptual limits or closure of a given ideological system. Such antinomies cannot be solved or resolved in their own terms; rather, they are violently restructured by an infrastruc- tural praxis, which, rendering the older oppositions meaningless, now lays the pre- conditions for some new conceptual system or ideology which has no immediate link with the preceding one. In this sense, even a social contradiction itself cannot be resolved; it can only be disarticulated and destroyed in its turn and its elements fundamentally reorganized; and this is no doubt the Marxian equivalent for that figure of "death" by which, in the Phenomenology, Hegel signals that discontinuous jolt from "moment" to "moment" so often wrongly construed as a kind of "syn- thesis" of the preceding contradiction. if now we stress its closure as a system, we will find Greimas' semiotic rectangle a useful instrument for mapping both the content and the logical limits of a given ideology. in particular, it allows us to rearticulate that of the contemporary city in the following manner: diacritics/lune 1977 13</page><page sequence="13">The City (complex term) COMMUNITY-'4- "`",INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM CONCENTRATION. ,DECENTRALIZATION " ? (neutral term) Greimas' scheme makes it plain that the negation of any single term of this antinomic system only locks us more deeply into the double bind of the closed system itself. It also suggests the vocation of the as yet vacant neutral term to permit a desperate (and impossible) final attempt to eradicate the contradictions of the system by some extreme gesture. Unexpectedly, this gesture is none other than Xenakis' mile-high- city, which now falls into place as the inconceivable union of the two negative terms of concentration and decentralization. Xenakis' verticality is thus a tangible squaring of the circle, whose existence as a discourse and a text (but not as an image or a social, reality, even a future one) dramatically repudiates the older conceptual dilemma as a flat and two-dimensional effort to think the city on a plane surface, an ideological contradiction locked into the impossible alternatives of point and dispersal. For in some paradoxical, unthinkable fashion, rising out of "centrality" into some other dimension, Xenakis' cosmic city is both decentralized and concentrated all at once, and designates, as a figure, that place in which some future urban conceptuality, the categories of some concrete collective and city life as yet inconceivable to us, remain to be invented. We cannot leave the example of Xenakis' Utopia without a final qualification, which has to do precisely with this "absence of the concept" in Utopian textualiza- tion. Although Marin does not say so (but for an example of his own form of ideolog- ical analysis see what has become the best-known chapter of his book, "Disneyland as a Degenerate Utopia"), it is implicit in his historical scheme that in our own time, the critical value of Xenakis's Utopia-its function as a machine for neutralizing ideological contradictions-does not at all guarantee its immunity from a more properly ideological use as well. Quite the contrary; and Xenakis' transcendence of an older ideological system proves perfectly consistent with his elaboration of a new one, in the event that we may call the contemporary ideology of communication: "The problems of urban concentration are not going to be solved, writes Xenakis, by the vigorous pencil-slashes of decentralization on a map, nor by advocating the dispersal of the living complexity of Paris into smaller centers which will simply reduplicate its inconveniences, but rather [italics mine] by energetic attention to the general problem of communication, of exchange and of information in urban agglomerations" [Marin, p. 328; italics mine]. (It is not without interest that the same motif returns in LeGuin's "solution" to the problem-not merely of urban concentration-but also of the necessary centralization of industrial society as a whole, on Anarres the new decentralized organizational principle being assured, as in Xenakis' cosmic city, by computers [LeGuin, pp. 84-85]). So the Utopian neutrali- zation of the old ideology ends up making a contribution to the production of that new communicational one whose variants may be found in McLuhanism, systems theory, Habermas's "communications theory of society" and structuralism, to the degree to which each of these, above and beyond its value as an instrument of analysis, projects a more properly ideological anthropology or theory of "human nature" according to which it is proposed that society be organized. We may now at last return to the full-dress analysis of More's Utopia itself, where Marin's initial model is enriched with the content of history and complicated by all the discontinuities of a form in the process of emergence. Book One, with its lengthy debate between Hythloday and the courtiers about conditions in England, 14</page><page sequence="14">supplies the raw material and sketches out the fundamental social contradictions on which Book Two must perform its work of transformation and neutralization and Utopian production. The contradiction is already implicit, as Marin notes, in that remarkable and prophetic diagnosis of English social turmoil with which Hythloday justifies his attack on capital punishment, the point being that the diagnosis is itself heterogeneous and envelops two relatively distinct explanatory systems. On the one hand, Hythloday suggests that the immense increase in the number of beggars-what would today be called a rural lumpenproletariat-is the result of the breakdown of the older feudal manor, that extended social unit which includes, besides the lord and his family, and the peasants and artisans who support them, the feudal retinue which ensures his power. In More's day, indeed, under the twofold pressure of world-wide inflation and royal centralization, the feudal lords find it increasingly expedient to divest themselves of this expensive multitude of soldiers and petty nobility; the latter, suddenly without employment, are thus thrown in the way of highway robbery and brigandage, if not of revolution itself (as in the German peasant wars during this same period). The explicit link More establishes between the social disorder of the countryside and the inner collapse of feudalism as a system has long been ap- preciated as one of the most original insights of his book. The trouble is that this initial diagnosis is then reduplicated by a second one of a rather different type: this is the historically and economically crucial indictment by Hythloday of the contemporary movement of enclosure, by which, as is well known, masses of peasants were evicted and transformed into a rural lumpenproletariat of a different type than that rabble of unemployed petty nobles referred to above. But unlike the previous critique, of the inner disintegration of feudalism, this one is a critique of nascent capitalism, and determines a perspective whose distance from the first can most dramatically be measured at the end of Book Two, when Hythloday identifies the vices or transgressions that threaten the Utopian system as such. For it is too easy to say that the critique of feudal decadence and the denuncia- tion of the various modes of corruption of the market system are both subsumed under a nostalgia for a healthier feudal order which is a coherent class position in its own right. This is not the place to ask whether a genuinely coherent critique of capitalism from a feudal perspective is structurally and ideologically possible: what is certain is that when Hythloday at the end of his description of the island comes to give an account of Utopian virtue, the two quite distinct opposites or vices projected by this ideal value-they are, on the one hand, pride, and on the other, money- betray their sociological origins in the quite distinct milieux of feudal ostentation and of commerce (thus, B1nichou has shown how later, in the seventeenth century, the humiliation of pride becomes a strategy, if not of the middle classes, than of the noblesse de robe, for undermining feudal pretensions [see Les Morales du grand siecle (Paris: Gallimard, 1948), "La D6molition du h6ros", pp. 97-111]). The structural inconsistency between these two ultimate diagnoses may also be expressed as the widening distance between a proto-economic analysis of society and one which remains ethical in the immemorial religious framework of the hierarchy of virtues and vices. What may at least be allowed is that the distance between two ideologies, between two forms of class consciousness-opens up the empty place in which Utopia itself emerges. For the oscillation between these two explanatory systems itself reflects the conceptual limits of this transitional period (for which no alternative to feudalism or capitalism is yet conceivable) and explains why, in the absence of any genuine historical and social self-consciousness, what has been conceptually unformulizable becomes the raw material and the occasion for a very different type of mental opera- tion, namely what must be called the work of figuration. We are, indeed, at the very heart of Marin's book when we begin to grasp the originality of its demonstration of a "work of figuration" of a different order than that already familiar to us in the analysis of myth or dream. Nor is it without interest to observe the deeper affinities between this aspect of his work and the direction in diacritics/june 1977 15</page><page sequence="15">which some of Althusser's group have evolved, most notably Pierre Macherey, whose pioneering work, Pour une thdorie de la production littdraire [Paris: Maspero, 1966], in particular the chapter on Jules Verne, describes the way in which a given ideology ends up betraying itself and providing its own self-critique through the very process by which it attempts (in vain) to endow itself with literary and narrative figuration. But precisely because we have to do with figuration, in other words with pre- conceptual thinking or discourse, the ideological "contradiction" just outlined can- not be the starting point for our analysis of the text but must rather come as the latter's confirmation and interpretation. Marin's own starting point, indeed, has a unique methodological specificity which it owes, less to the more traditional models of figurative analysis already enumerated (Freud, L6vi-Strauss, etc.), than to his work in the field of the semiotics of painting (see in particular his Etudes sdmiologiques [Paris: Klincksieck, 1971]), where his privileged objects of study have been those images already in some way structurally associated with a verbal text, a text either visible within the image itself as motto, script, or emblem, or else implied by it as its historical or mythological source and the classical allusion therewith illustrated. The peculiar duality of registers observable in such visual objects guarantees them against any temptation to collapse one of them back into the other, to see the text as a mere pretext, or on the other hand to reduce the visual register to the merely fictional or illustrative. It is indeed Marin's constitution of his object of study as a relationship, or more precisely, as a structural discontinuity [6cart], which accounts for the evolution of his more recent work in the direction of those literary texts in which a similar duality of registers can be detected (as for instance in fables or fairy-tales which juxtapose the discursive structure of a concluding moral with the quite different narrative texture of the fable proper.) This duality of the registers of image and text has its equivalent in the structure of More's Utopia (and indeed, to varying degrees, in that of all properly Utopian discourse): it is simply the relationship between, and the gap that separates, the map of the imaginary non-place and the verbal discourse in which the place and its institutions are recounted. Unlike the painted objects of the Etudes stmiologiques, however, the two registers are here both immanent to the verbal text itself, in the sense that the map is not given as an accompanying plate or illustration bound within the volume, but must rather be reconstructed from the data furnished by Hythlo- day's account. (This immanence is then what accounts for the ingenious reversal of two of the later chapters of Utopiques, in which Marin reconstructs the latent verbal text implicit in a series of classical maps of historical places.) There thus emerges a tension, profoundly characteristic of all Utopian dis- course, between description and narrative, between the effort of the text to establish the coordinates of a stable geographical entity, and its other vocation as sheer movement and restless displacement, as itinerary and exploration and, ultimately, as event. This is no doubt a tension present in all travel narrative as such, with which Utopia has an obvious generic kinship. Yet classically the traveller's narrative, which bears within itself the resistant nucleus of some genuinely contingent and irreduci- ble, historical and topographical reality, tends to become a process of transforma- tion whereby the object given, the hitherto unexplored landscape-Nature-is worked over until it can be dissolved and assimilated by the older value systems of some more properly European super-ego-in other words, Culture [see for a dem- onstration of this process Michel de Certeau's chapter on the travel narrative of Jean de LEry in L'Ecriture de I'histoire (Paris: Gallimard, 1975)]. In Utopian discourse, on the contrary, it is the narrative itself which tends to be effaced by and assimilated to sheer description, as anyone knows who has ever nodded over the more garru- lous explanatory passages in the classical Utopias. Indeed, one of the basic con- straints of the form would seem to be the incompatibility within it between action or events and that timeless map-like extension of the non-place itself: in other words, if things can really happen in Utopia, if real disorder, change, transgression, novelty, in brief if history is possible at all, then we begin to doubt whether it can really be a 16</page><page sequence="16">Utopia after all, and its institutions-from a promise of the fulfillment of collective living-slowly began to turn around into their opposite, a more properly dystopian repression of the unique existential experience of individual lives. (And the same inversion may be detected on the level of the characters, where, to the degree to which the Utopian citizens take on individual specificity, their exemplary value as abstract citizens is undermined and they come to stand as figures for discord, for what is unassimilable to a Utopian harmony which has itself correlatively undergone a dialectical reversal into tyrannical unanimity.) Nonetheless, even in More the absorption of narrative by description is far from complete: and it is precisely the lack of coincidence between the two that yields the clues and provides the instrument of analysis for Marin's reading. The discrepancy, indeed, between the verbal account of the island given by Hythloday and its pos- sibilities of geometrical realization leads us to the most important findings of Utopiques, which can here only briefly be summarized. These bear on the non- congruence of text and geography in the three fundamental areas of Utopian social structure, political organization, and economic activity respectively, the point being that in no one of the three can Hythloday's account be perfectly matched, in a one-to-one correspondence, against the "ideal map" projected by the data he supplies. But this is something more than mere sloppiness or imaginative failure: rather, the inconsistencies thereby revealed are systematic, and the structural dis- crepancies are not random but determinate ones, their absences and lacunae now readable as symptoms of some deeper contradiction within the text. Foremost among the problems raised by the description of the social structure of Utopia is the difficulty of reconciling the internal organization of its sub-groups with the external network of relations they entertain among each other. The attempt to coordinate all of Hythloday's data in this respect results in a kind of imbalance between the division of the quarters into communal groups which share a common garden around which they live, and the jurisdiction of their collective dining halls which, drawing their membership from opposite sides of the streets which separate the gardens, thus presumably, but inexplicably, mingle people from two different communities: UTOPIQUES : JEUX D'ESPACES h6tels des! syphograntes jardin communautaire de Iquartier Figure 15. - Plan d'un auartier et d'une rue. diacritics/june 1977 17</page><page sequence="17">This particular imbalance is then perpetuated in the impossibility of working out the seating plan of the dining halls themselves, where the elders are supposed to be placed at regular intervals between the other citizens in an attempt to combine a political or administrative structure harmoniously with the more fundamental social and economic structure of the family units. That this is no mere lapse on More's part, but rather to be interrogated as a meaningful symptom, may be demonstrated by the translation of this cartographic dilemma into the more properly conceptual form of an antinomy: for we can read this apparently insignificant failure in technical execu- tion as the ideological difficulty of reconciling a hierarchical social order-based on the authority of the elders within the family groups-with that ideal of absolute equality which is supposed to govern the organization of Utopia as a whole. It will therefore not be surprising to find that this particular contradiction has its equivalent on the level of the overall political organization of the Utopian state itself. The island is a federation of fifty-four city states, all equal; meanwhile Amaurotum, the capital, and therefore the home of the Prince and the seat of the representative assembly, stands at the exact geometrical center of the island. But how can a federa- tion have a center, and what is still worse, how can a federation of city-states have a Prince? The historical source of this dilemma lies clearly in the centralizing ab- solutism characteristic of More's own time, in which the monarch increases his own power by proposing himself as an arbiter, "above the parties," of the conflict be tween the feudal nobility and the city bourgeoisie. On the map, the result is that although the Prince's palace and the national senate are supposed to be located at the exact geographical center of the city of Amaurotum, the city has no center, being divided equally into four identical districts. These cartographic discrepancies reach their climax on the economic level of the text, which assigns the island's commercial activity to a central market for which no place can be found in the strict letter of Hythloday/More's account. When we remember, however, that the lasting historical originality of More's conception of Utopia springs from the radical elimination from it of money as such, it becomes difficult to resist the feeling that this structural absence of the market-place betrays some deeper contradiction than any of the foregoing and, through the very difficulty it suggests of thinking an exchange system that would somehow be separate from money itself as a medium, designates that fundamental blank or blind spot in the episteme of the time which is the notion of capitalism itself, and which will there- fore only gradually be filled in by the developing political economy of the 18th and 19th centuries. This absence of a theoretical discourse yet to be developed, this figural anticipation, in the form of a blank or gap, of what could not in the very nature of things be conceptualized, is for Marin the very place of origin and inau- guratory impulse of the genre itself: "Utopian discourse is the one form of ideologi- cal discourse that has anticipatory value of a theoretical kind: but it is a value which can only appear as such after theory itself has been elaborated, that is to say, sub- sequent to the emergence of the material conditions for the new productive forces" [p. 255; for a translation of the book's central "Theses on Ideology and Utopia", see the aforementioned special issue of the Minnesota Review on "Marxism and Utopia," pp. 71-75]. Such, broken, yet carrying within itself that absence of which it is itself but the fragmentary and uneven surcharge, is the Utopian figure. It now remains for us to rewrite the essentials of Marin's account in terms of the latter's production; and as we do so Book One (written later than the description of the island, but evidently generated by the latter as a precondition of its own production) will once more become of interest to us. For above and beyond the incommensurability between the historical reforms proposed by Book One and the Utopian "vision" of Book Two, the reader who has begun to grasp the spirit of Marin's method will find his or her attention jogged and arrested by the insertion, within the discursive texture of the 18</page><page sequence="18">former, of a puzzling and partial Utopian figure-the example of the Polylerites- which seems in some ways an anticipation of the latter on a small and anecdotal scale. Already, then, in the midst of a political debate on historical conditions by "real-life" historical figures, the emergence of a Utopian figure almost in spite of itself would seem a privileged occasion for understanding the process of Utopian production in general. But to do this, we must go back to the terms of Hythloday's debate with the courtiers, in order to identify that radical insufficiency in it which seems to demand the generation of a Utopian anecdote for its own completion. We have already noted one of the fundamental contradictions of Hythloday's great speech to the Cardinal (the coexistence of the critique of feudalism with a critique of nascent capitalism); it is now worth underscoring a rather different one, which is simply that-already underscored by Marx and Engels in their critique of Utopian socialism-of an over- emphasis on the power of rationality in general and a basic and constitutive overes- timation of the functional role of rhetoric and persuasion in particular in the histori- cal process whereby an imperfect world may be transformed into a more satisfactory one. Hythloday's appeal to the Cardinal may thus be said to block out the place, and the concrete social and historical situation, of the Renaissance humanists them- selves, of whom Max Weber has said that their intellectual program amounted to nothing less than an abortive revolution and the attempt of a certain aristocratic caste to constitute itself as a bureaucratic ruling class on the order of the mandarins in classical China. (Their failure to do so then left the door ajar for the emergence of that more properly middle-class bureaucracy which was to form around the absolute monarchs of succeeding centuries.) In hindsight, therefore, we may associate the Archimedean space of Renaissance rhetoric and humanist persuasion, that imaginary fulcrum projected outside of the two worlds of late feudal England and some Tudor and Stuart bureaucracy to come, as the more general position of intellectuals as a group, whose tendency to overestimate their own structural role in the political and historical process is familiar to all of us. Yet this permits a somewhat different read- ing of the qualitative distinction we continue to sense between More's Utopia and those other characteristic expressions of the humanist discourse of the period (The Praise of Folly, II Cortegiano, indeed even The Prince itself) with which it otherwise seems to have so much in common: the Utopian figure would in this case be the sign of More's dawning awareness of the inefficacy of those fundamental humanist in- struments and categories which are rhetoric and persuasion. Utopia would then be generated, not so much by an overestimation of the powers of reason, as rather by an unformulated consciousness of its failure, and by Hythloday's experience (in Book One) of the impotence of discursive argument and disputation in the making or at least the transformation of history. Such an interpretation finds confirmation in Marin's analysis of the "preliminary Utopia" of the Polylerites. The latter are introduced, it will be remembered, as an answer to the courtiers' objections to Hythloday's views on capital punishment, as his "proof" that the replacement of the death sentence by forced labor which he proposes (as a punishment for theft) is in fact practically realizable: this is to say, in our present context, that it is narratable, or in other words capable of narrative figuration. Hence the shifting of gears from a rhetorical presentation to a narrative example. Nonetheless, there turns out to be a structural inconsistency between the Uto- pian and anecdotal, narrative "proof" of the example of the Polylerites and that abstract policy whose wisdom and/or practicality it was supposed to document. The Utopian community of the Polylerites, "altogether satisfied with the products of their own land", living "a life more comfortable than splendid and more happy than renowned or famous" [More, p. 31], is in one sense of course little more than a pretext for illustrating the effects of the policy Hythloday proposes and for giving a picture of what the convicts themselves would look like, "dressed in clothes of the same color, their hair [. . .] not shaved but cropped a little above the ears, from one of which the top is cut off", etc. [p. 32]. The real problem is that by Hythloday's own diacritics/june 1977 19</page><page sequence="19">account of the matter there ought not to have been any thieves in this happy land to begin with, so that the very possibility of a just (that is to say, a Utopian) punishment is necessarily at one with the disappearance of the crime it was designed for. We here glimpse a kind of totalizing logic in the imagination of Utopia which, gathering its own momentum, undermines and discredits all of the partial and purely reformist "insights" it was supposed to generate on its passage through; thus even the use of Utopian materials as illustrations or examples for the reforming argumentation of humanist rhetoric involves a contradiction, and drives the text inexorably on into its own paradoxical realization as a full-dress Utopia. The process may be observed even more strikingly in another feature of the preliminary Utopia of the Polylerites, insofar as this narrative material, as anecdotal and illustrative as it may be, nonetheless presupposes a certain number of precondi- tions before it can achieve narrative representability or figuration. Chief among these, in the example of the kingdom of the Polylerites, is the textual obligation to reconcile their existence within the historical world contemporary with Tudor soci- ety (which can alone make them available as a pedagogical or political model for the latter) with that necessary disjunction from the imperfection of existing historical space and historical societies without which the Utopian purity of their customs must remain inconceivable. More squares this circle, as Marin points out, with a trick, which is however extremely suggestive in our present context: the Polylerite state is said to be a protectorate of the Persian Empire, and thus doubly isolated from the historical world, first by the chain of mountains that surrounds it, but then also, and far more significantly, by this permission to exist granted to it by a historical society which undertakes to leave it alone. Shades of Huxley's Pala, its hallucinogenic bonheur precariously sheltered from the imminent menace of the Sears-Roebuck catalogue! But where Huxley's imagination, having produced his Utopia, must then resign itself to the implacable narrative and historical logic whereby the latter is then once more effaced and reabsorbed into the violence and stupidity of the outside real world itself, More's-generated by an inverse logic inherent even in this tiny Utopian fragment--evolves in the opposite direction of the production of a Utopian text ever less historically dependent, and guaranteed by a set of Utopian boundaries ever more absolute, by a disjunction ever more fundamental and peremptory. This new boundary is, as is well known, the great trench which King Utopus causes to be dug to sunder from the mainland that promontory thereby transformed into the island of Utopia; and it is also the empty atmosphere through which a few ancient spaceships ferry the Odonian settlers to their barren planet, their Utopia of scarcity [for more on the relationship between Utopia and disjunction, see my "World Reduction in LeGuin: The Emergence of Utopian Narrative," Science-Fiction Studies #7 (Vol. II, No. 3; November, 1975), pp. 221-230]. The operation is of course not only that of disjunction but one of exclusion as well: indeed, the other basic feature of Utopian economics (not touched on above) provides for the location of many of the unpleasant tasks associated with market and commercial activity-such as the slaughter of animals--outside the city's walls. To this still local mode of exclusion within Utopia corresponds a more global one that governs its relations with the outside world in general: not only is money itself excluded-and then used exclusively in foreign trade and for corrupting enemy governments and the like-but violence itself-embodied by mainland mercenaries hired to fight the Utopians' wars for them-is ejected and then reestablished outside the charmed circle that confirms the Utopian commonwealth. Violence and money: was this not the very alternation we found at work in More's diagnosis of Tudor England, as well as in his ultimate formulation of the twin vices rebuked by Utopian virtue? the trampling arrogance of the feudal retinues and mercenaries on the one hand, the silent and invisible solvent of the market system on the other as it corrodes the older social forms-twin evils now externally negated by geographical fiat just as their inner principles have been structurally neutralized by the order of Utopian discourse itself. 20</page><page sequence="20">This act of disjunction/exclusion which founds Utopia as a genre is also the source of everything problematical about it, and about the position of the "neuter" in general, both within and without the system, an observation post which is how- ever, unlike the ideologies of science itself and the "sujet suppose savoir," without any real term or position of its own [see, on the philosophical status of the neuter, Marin's opening chapter, "Du neutre pluriel et de I'utopie"]. In a reflection on Utopian reading that echoes some of the basic hypotheses of the Russian Formalists, Marin writes: "We first ask the question: 'What does this story narrate? What is the object described by this description?' But no sooner have we done so than this initial question is converted into a different one: 'How does the story narrate this object? How can its description go about describing it?' And we end up with the realization that the way in which the story is told is the story itself, that the narrative never in reality narrates anything other than its own narrative procedures [Ila maniere dont elle s'y prend pour raconter] , these being indeed its truest subject-matter" [p. 151]. From this point of view, then, the Utopian narrative might be described as one which, having come into being by a radical act of disjunction, must then summon up all of its energies into a "motivation" of that initial disjunction into an elaborate, endless, impossible demonstration that such unimaginable separation from the inex- tricable totality of Being of that "real" world in which history and indeed the reader himself exist was in fact "imaginable" in the first place. The ultimate subject-matter of Utopian discourse would then turn out to be its own conditions of possibility as discourse. Yet such desperate formalism, and the spectacle of a genre lifting itself up into being by its own bootstraps, is perhaps only the obverse and the corollary of its most genuine chance for authenticity: for it would follow, in that case, that Utopia's deepest subject, and the source of all that is most vibrantly political about it, is precisely our inability to conceive it, our incapacity to produce it as a vision, our failure to project the other of what is, a failure that, as with fireworks dissolving back into the night sky, must once again leave us alone with this history. This is surely the ultimate sense in which "Utopian discourse accompanies ideological discourse as its converse and designates the still empty place of a scientific theory of society" [p. 253].
