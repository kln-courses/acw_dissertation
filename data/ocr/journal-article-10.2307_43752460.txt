In many cases, unplanned urbanization is the main factor that causes a decrease in coastal resilience. This paper compares the differences between the anthropogenic and natural coastal zone, based on the morphological dune reconstruction, using a low cost UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) survey and the photogrammetric reconstruction method. The study area is in the Northern Littoral of Rio Grande do Sul State, where the dunes have few man- changes and are adjacent to an anthropogenic zone with a highly modified beach/dune system. By photogrammetric reconstruction it was possible to obtain a high-resolution DSM (Digital Surface Model) and a high-resolution othophoto to analyse differences in morphology. Data acquired by UAV's are important to coastal managers and decision makers as they can collect high-resolution data and be used for Integrated Coastal Zone Management. Moreover this work propose a low cost method for obtaining a high-resolution data for researchers and local authorities. ADDITIONAL INDEX WORDS: ICZM; coastal morphology; coastal zone; photogrammetry. INTRODUCTION To increase knowledge about coastal environmental behavior and to apply integrated coastal zone management (ICZM), it is essential to know about the pressures on the system and the interaction between the anthropogenic and natural factors (Psuty, 1988; Sherman and Bouer, 1993; Hesp, 2002; Carrasco et al, 2012). This knowledge aids coastal managers in improving their choices for coastal resource management, decreasing vulnerability and hazard as well as attending to stakeholders interests (Kindermann, and Gormally, 2013). To acquire more information and to monitor the coastal environment, local authorities need a better cost-benefit tool to obtain data on natural factors such as the impact of the storm- surges on the coast, and anthropogenic pressure factors as the urban zone expands (Andrews et al , 2002; Lambert and Zanuttigh, 2005; Davidson et al. , 2006; Tatui et al , 2013). This work proposes a methodology to acquire high-resolution Digital Surface Models (DSM) and ortho-rectified images (orthophotos) in the coastal environment (Mancini et al , 2013) using a low cost and easy to operate unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Moreover, the data may be used in several disciplines, DOI: 10.21 12/SI75-247.1 received 15 October, 2015; accepted in revision 15 January, 2016. * Corresponding author: frederico.scarelli@ufrgs.br ®Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc. 2016 including engineering, urban planning, biological, geological and environmental sciences, archaeology and others (Gares et al, 2006). The study aims to investigate the morphology and the interaction between natural and anthropogenic features of a dune/beach system on a Brazilian coastal region, using aerial photos obtained from a UAV survey (Casella et al, 2014; Gonçalvez and Henriques, 2015). In this work we have done a qualitative analysis since the main aim is to propose the methodology to acquire environmental data at a low cost. In the region where this study was conducted, many features are present that may increase the vulnerability and the risks in the coastal zone such as small creeks, which are washouts through the foredunes and beach named "sangradouros", according to Figueiredo and Calliari, (2005). These are mainly pluvial water drainage channels that are about 0.8 m deep. These features may be observed along the entire Rio Grande do Sul (RS) coast and are mainly present in the urbanized stretches. These washouts represent a high coastal hazard, because in many cases the beaches are trafficked by cars and the washouts are hidden, causing severe accidents. In addition, due to the foredune fragmentation the sediment transport from dune and beach to the surf zone, mainly during storms, may create a sediment deficit, increasing coastal erosion. Finally, this work offers a good coast-benefit tool for local authorities to increase the investments in the local ICZM and in tip www.JCRonline.org</page><page sequence="2">Minimisation of the Uncertainty in Estimation of Extreme Coastal Wave Heights the coastal urbanization planning, since many of the coastal settlements grow without an urban plan (Esteves et al ., 2003). Background The study area is in Capão Novo, a beach settlement in the Northern littoral stretch of Rio Grande Do Sul (RS), the southernmost state of Brazil (Figure 1). The RS coast is approximately 620 km length, has a gentle undulating barrier coast with a NE-SW orientation, and is characterized by a barrier-lagoon depositional system formed by sea level changes during the Quaternary (Villwock et al., 1986; Dillenburg et al , 2009). The coast is classified as dissipative and intermediate beaches; the beaches area about 60 m in width (Gruber et al. , 2006), and have a microtidal regime with a semidiurnal tide with a mean range of 0.5 m. It is a wave-dominated coast and the sediment supply is by littoral drift that is northward. The barrier deposits are dominated by very fine to medium grained quartz sand; the dominant winds are from NE during spring and summer, and from SW during autumn and winter (from April to July). The latter are responsible for the stronger storm surges (Dillenburg and Barboza, 2014). The average significant wave height is 1.5 m, and during storms the sea level may surge up to 1.3 m at the coast (Barletta and Calliari, 2001; Calliari et al., 1998). Figure 1 . Study area in North Littoral of RS. The red polygon is the UAV survey area. The study area is located in a mildly concave part of the coast in a regressive stretch of the barrier that was covered by trasgressive dunefields during the barrier progradation (Dillenburg et al., 2009; Barboza et al., 201 1 and 2013). In this stretch, the reduction and dispersion of wave energy resulted in a positive balance for the sediment budget, however, the anthropogenic activities and an unplanned development (Esteves et al., 2003) increased the vulnerability along the coast. The foredunes have been subject to urbanization with sidewalks built directly above the dunes, beachfront properties and sand mining, Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 75, 2016 1233</page><page sequence="3">Minimisation of the Uncertainty in Estimation of Extreme Coastal Wave Heights that affected the local sand balance (Dillenburg et al , 2004). Capão Novo and near settlements represent the most developed and urbanized beaches in this stretch, principally by holiday houses that are engaged during the summer season. The beaches were classified as developed and mainly eroding beaches by Estves et al. , (2003). This study focuses on a 600 m stretch which includesa part of a dune in an urbanized zone and a part of dune in an adjacent non urbanized zone, with a washout in between. METHODS To do an high-accuracy analysis of the stretch under study a low coast UAV was used to obtain a high-resolution DSM and orthophoto from a photogrammetric reconstruction method (Mancini et al , 2013). The flight was done in the final part of the summer season (mid-march) when the beach presented a summer profile. To collect the aerial photographs a DJI Phantom quadcopter was utilised, a smaller commercial UAV costing about USD$ 1,000. The advantages of this UAV are that it has an easy flight system platform allowing a safe control and operability and costs much more less than a professional UAV. The DJI Phantom UAV has an integrated GPS Positioning Module as ±0.8m vertical and ±2. 5m horizontal accuracy, a Controlled Automatic Return to Home; an Intelligent Flight Battery; a 3-Axis Camera Stabilization; a 14 Megapixel HD camera, which has a FOV (field of view) 140° f/2.8 focus at oo, with real-time Camera Preview on IOS and Android Device Application. A smartphone integrated with the the UAV Remote Controller is required to control the camera. The survey took about one hour, and was done in three flights in the entire stretch, flying at three different heights, -16, -30, and -5 m above the washout to increase data resolution. The flight speed was -1.5 m/s; and 689 photos were acquired, shot perpendicular to the ground, with about 80% overlap between the aerial photos to allow the creation of the DSM in Agisoft Photoscan software. The UAV flight was coupled with a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) eTrex®30-Garmin with barometric altimeter and with the local topographic chart. The flight track acquired was used to insert a geotag in all the photos using BaseCampTM. For high-accuracy that allows one to use the model for a quantitative and future comparative analyses 36 Ground Control Points (GCPs) were used and georeferenced by Differential Global Navegation Satellite System (DGNSS) using a Trimble® ProXRT GNSS in UTM-WGS84-22S. These used in Agisoft as monument points in coded targets. Due to the FOV wide-angle camera on the UAV, a customized calibration profile to recover planarity in the potos was used, and this calibration allow us to obtain a higher accuracy orthophoto.. Using a Structure from Motion (SfM) approach (Snavely et al. , 2007) by Agisoft Photoscan Professional Edition algorithms workflow (Agisoft, 2013), after photo alignment and GCPs the following was accomplished: i) point cloud; ii) the dense cloud, where the model was cleaned, deleting the outlyer points and persons or other objects;iii) a mesh was built; and iv) the texture. After this workflow the model has been exported into a DSM in ascii format and an orthophoto in tiff extension, allowingthe data to be imported into a Geographic Information System (GIS) software. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION This survey allow us to obtain a DSM with a 0.3 m cell resolution and an othophoto with a pixel size of 0.05 m. The orthophoto was draped on the DSM to improve this analysis, allowing us to identify the features in the area, such as the vegetation density. In this model the features without interest were not eliminated such as the people, cars or trees, because these elements may indicate the survey quality. Based on the model results (Figure 2) it is possible to recognize clear differences between the natural and urbanized areas: In the urbanized area (Figure 2E and 2F): the dune is very fragmented, the blowouts are visible, the anthropogenic pressure is very high with a walkway above the dune, and behind the dune facilities. In addition, a -controlled washout is present, which removes sediments from the foreshore/backshore and carries them to the surf zone, decreasing the dune resilience. Since according to Tomazelli et al. (2008) most of the sediment to the natural system nourishment of the dune system in the Northern Littoral of RS comes from the backshore/foreshore, that are transported by the NE wind.In the natural area (Figure 2C and 2D), an active dune field is present, with vegetation that increases in density inland. The sediment availability for the system equilibrium due to the seasonal beach profile changes is clearly higher and the washout is bigger than in the urbanized area and without human driven changes. Actually this area presents the same morphological characteristics of the zone in 1 948 where it is possible to identify the dune fields with a NE orientation but without anthropomorphic pressures. This survey has disadvantages and advantages, which are necessary to discuss to increase the potential of the method in future work. The disadvantages are the time to realize the workflow on Agisoft, mainly to obtain high-resolution data; a powerful computer is necessary; the cost of the GNSS equipment to do the GCPs survey with high accuracy; in the surveys where water and features in movement are present, there may be some gaps because, the vegetation is moved by wind, and the software is unable to point match between the potos. For a quantitative analysis of the volumumetric changes with high accuracy, the vegetation cover may be a problem because it interfers with accurate results. In addition, weather is another limiting factor because the Dji Phanton cannot fly in wind speeds above -18 km/h winds. The advantages are the price to acquire high-resolution data if compared to the other UAV' s or LiDAR surveys that may be able to provide the same data accuracy; the facility to operate the UAV with high security; the logistics are simpler allowing a quick organization for the surveys after an interesting event such as a storm appears; easily repeatability of the data to increase the database and to aid coastal monitoring; the data may be used in different disciplines for scientific work as well for management work. CONCLUSIONS Using a low coast UAV, it has been possible conduct a first high-accuracy DSM to study the coastal environment in the coast of RS. This has allowed us to investigate the factors that act in this zone and to understand in a detailed scale the environmental response to the urbanized areas. The results obtained from the aerial photographic survey are of great quality, which is ± 0.13 m accuracy, and in accordance with Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 75, 2016 1234</page><page sequence="4">Minimisation of the Uncertainty in Estimation of Extreme Coastal Wave Heights other work (Mancini et al., 2013; Casella et al 2014; Gonçalves and Henriques, 2015) where the same survey methodology was used using a SfM approach with a professional camera. This work provides a low cost methodology to aid the local authorities acquire high-resolution data in their area of interest and to improve the management and knowledge about the environment responses to natural and human pressures. In many cases, mainly in developing countries such as Brazil, the local authorities do not have funds to create a simple database to aid decision-makers in their actions, and this work and UAV provides a low cost alternative to support both scientific research or local authorities.
