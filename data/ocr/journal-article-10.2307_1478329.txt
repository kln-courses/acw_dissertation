Beardsley, Expression and Dance: A Reply to Gregory Scott In our article, "Working and Dancing" (1), we expressed some reservations about the characterization of dance advanced in Monroe Beardsley's excellent essay, "What Is Going on in a Dance?" (2) Concluding his article with what appears to be a definition of what counts as a dance movement, Beardsley says "If, in other words, there is more zest, vigor, fluency, expansiveness, or stateliness than appears necessary for [the movement's] practical purposes, there is an overflow or superfluity of expressiveness to mark it as belonging to its own domain of dance" (3). We argued that superfluity of expressiveness (in excess of what appears required for prac- tical purposes) was neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for belonging to the do- main of dance. One of our central counterexamples to Beardsley's thesis was Yvonne Rainer's Room Service, a dance that we take to be exemplary of the genre of the task dance, a genre we believe causes inter- esting problems for Beardsley's definition. Gregory Scott has spent a large part of two articles challenging that counterex- ample. In "Banes and Carroll on Defining Dance," Scott was primarily at pains to ar- gue that Room Service is not a dance, and, therefore, not an apt counterexample (4). We answered his objections in "Expression, Rhythm and Dance" (5). Now, in "Tran- scending the Beardsleyans," Scott is empha- sizing a different tack (6). He is willing to accept Room Service as a dance, but on al- legedly Beardsleyan grounds, thereby trans- forming what we thought was a counterex- ample to Beardsley's theory into an example of it. In this essay, we would like to explore 6 Dance Research Journal 31/2 (Fall 1999)</page><page sequence="2">Scott's latest defense of what he regards as a "fresh reading" of Beardsley (7). However, before addressing Scott di- rectly, we should iterate why we initially thought that Room Service was a worthwhile example to discuss, since Scott complains that we dwell on it too much. Originally, the choice of Room Service stemmed not only from the fact that it refuted Beardsley's defi- nition but because it is well known that defi- nitions of art in general and of particular artforms like dance run the danger of being unintentionally conservative-of excluding important contemporary work. Theorists of- ten spend too much time looking backwards and ignoring what is around them. Our de- bate with Beardsley occurred at the end of the seventies, when task dances-the genre which Room Service exemplifies-were a major mode of choreographic experimenta- tion. Thus, we initially chose Room Service for discussion not only because it raised problems for Beardsley's theory, but also as a reminder that aestheticians should stay at- tuned to the present and not, in effect, inad- vertently disenfranchise it. We agree with Scott that other counterexamples are avail- able, but we went with Room Service because it had the advantage of drawing philosophi- cal attention toward contemporary practice. Moreover, we find Scott's complaints about our continued discussion of Room Service perplexing, since we are basically respond- ing to lengthy objections to Room Service that he has raised. We would probably not have returned to Room Service had Scott not reopened the discussion of it. Scott believes that a better counterex- ample to Beardsley's definition than Room Service would be a composition of rhythmi- cal pedestrian movements (8). This seems far too underdescribed to us to be an effec- tive counterexample. The marching of the Ladies Auxiliary in a hometown parade could count as a composition of rhythmical pedestrian movements and, therefore, Beardsley need not be threatened by it, since it is not a dance. Something would have to be added to make the notion of a composi- tion of rhythmical pedestrian movement work as a counterexample to a definition of dance. Undoubtedly, that would involve is- sues of context and framing. But then the example seems no better than Room Service, since it is the context and framing of the mattress-moving in that piece that, we claim, gives it its status as dance movement. In "Transcending the Beardsleyans," Scott continues to attribute to Beardsley an Augustinian position-that dance is the cre- ation of rhythmical movement for the sake of pleasure-that we have shown Beardsley explicitly rejected (9). Probably Beardsley, for good reason, did not make engendering pleasure a necessary part of his definition of dance, since much dance, like much art, does not aim at producing pleasure, but sometimes at provoking disturbance and displeasure (e.g., Wigman's Witch Dance, Balanchine's Opus 34). Tying dance to the production of pleasure constrains the ambit of dance un- duly, and Beardsley in all likelihood realized this. Scott also maintains that the mattress- moving in Room Service may meet the re- quirements of Beardsley's definition because it is nonpractical. Certainly, in some senses, the relevant mattress-moving is nonpractical, but this concession is beside the point, since Beardsley requires of dance movings that they involve a superfluity of expressiveness beyond the practical. For Beardsley, a move- ment is not a dance movement simply for being nonpractical; it must involve a super- fluity of expressiveness over and above the practical requirements of the movement. The mattress-moving in Room Service does not meet these criteria-it has no excess expres- siveness-though it is, as a proper part of Room Service, dance movement. The prob- lem with Scott's nonpracticality objection is that he selectively abstracts part of Beardsley's definition, but ignores Beardsley's complete statement of it. It is as Dance Research Journal 31/2 (Fall 1999) 7</page><page sequence="3">if Scott thought that a spinster is a bachelor because he is only attending to the unmarriedness requirement in the definition of a bachelor. Most of Scott's objections to our treat- ment of Room Service address the "super- fluity of expressiveness" requirements of Beardsley's definition. Basically, he con- tends that Room Service meets these require- ments and, therefore, fails as a counterex- ample to Beardsley's theory. To this end, Scott runs through various possible notions of expressiveness and argues that, under many of them, Room Service is expressive. This ignores Beardsley's emphasis on a su- perfluity of expressiveness. Thus, many of Scott's remarks fail to address the debate be- tween Beardsley and us. Admittedly, Scott thinks the superfluity requirement in Beardsley's theory is ineffectual and sug- gests that it is better to overlook it (10). But if Scott thinks so little of the superfluity re- quirement, why is he so harsh on us for at- tacking it (11)? And, in any case, we think that the superfluity requirement was not a slip of the pen on Beardsley's part. He knew he needed something like it, lest his theory be too inclusive, since much human move- ment that is not dance is expressive. Unlike Scott, we think that Beardseley's require- ment of a superfluity of expressiveness was theoretically well-motivated, even if ulti- mately mistaken. On our interpretation, the mattress-mov- ing in Room Service is dance movement de- signed to call attention to the ordinary move- ment of human bodies involved in mundane tasks. The movement is exhibited in order to be scrutinized for its own sake, not for the sake of something else, like sizing up the dancers as potential furniture movers. In ev- eryday life, we often tend to neglect the intel- ligence of the human body as it manifests it- self in practical affairs. The point of Room Service is to recall our attention to this ne- glected aspect of human life. If this interpre- tation is correct, then that gives us a reason, among others, to categorize the movements as dance movement, since dance is an artform primarily devoted to the appreciation of movement for its own sake (12). But if Room Service is a successful dance on its own terms, then it can involve no superfluity of expressiveness beyond the practical, be- cause if it did, it would pragmatically contra- dict its own aims-it would not exhibit the mundane practical intelligence of the body. Scott replies that if, by expressive quali- ties, we have in mind anthropomorphic quali- ties, then Room Service meets Beardsley's criteria, since, by our account, it displays the intelligence of the human body. But here Scott misunderstands both Beardsley's defi- nition and our counterexample. Beardsley's theory calls for a superfluity of expressive- ness, not just expressiveness. And our point is that a piece like Room Service cannot, on the pain of pragmatic self-contradiction, employ a superfluity of expressiveness be- yond the practical, if it is committed to dis- closing the intelligence of ordinary, practi- cal work movements. So even granting that Room Service projects the anthropomorphic quality of intelligence, Scott has failed to defend Beardsley's theory from our counterexample. Scott seems to think that Beardsley is not really committed to the superfluity of expressiveness requirement because, accord- ing to Beardsley, "'droopy exhaustion and mechanical compulsion-weaknesses of the will, as well as strengths-can be expres- sive" (13). However, we do not see why this indicates that Beardsley didn't actually stand by the superfluity requirement. "Droopy ex- haustion" and "mechanical compulsion" appear to signal a superfluity of expressive- ness, and, of course, weakness of the will can also be and often is represented with excess expressiveness beyond the practical (as in Balanchine's Prodigal Son). So why suppose that Beardsley's belief that weak- ness of the will can be a topic of dance en- tails that he doesn't hold to the superfluity 8 Dance Research Journal 31/2 (Fall 1999)</page><page sequence="4">requirement? Also against Beardsley's com- mitment to superfluity, Scott writes "it would be strange for a philosopher to identify x with 'superfluity of x,' in this case expressiveness with its superfluity" (14). But Beardsley is not identifying expressiveness with a super- fluity of expressiveness, but rather dance with a superfluity of expressiveness. There is no circularity here. Scott claims that there is no standard account of expressiveness in art. If that means that philosophers continue to argue about the nature of expressiveness, that is correct. But if he means that the concept is pretty much wide open to stipulative defini- tion, then we wonder why he wants to de- fend a philosophical theory that depends upon it as a central term. If expressiveness were such an unstable concept, shouldn't that be grounds for rejecting a theory like Beardsley's, rather than embracing it (15)? Of course, even if the notion of expres- siveness is problematic, we can, for the pur- poses of debate, refer to Beardsley's concept of expressiveness. He counts expressive qualities as what he calls regional qualities, which he further appears to identify with aesthetic qualities (16). Beardsley defines aesthetic qualities as "human qualities-that is, qualities similar to qualities found in per- sons, including their intentional states, their demeanor, and their behavior" (17). Accord- ing to Scott, if we treat expressive qualities as regional qualities, then Room Service meets Beardsley's definition. Once again, here Scott fails to take seriously Beardsley's requirement for a superfluity of expressivity (regional qualities). Room Service, even if it possesses anthropomorphic properties, does not possess them in superfluity (18). Second, it is not clear that the bodily in- telligence exhibited in Room Service is (or is presented) as similar to qualities found in persons. Rather it is the very quality being exhibited. We do not think that Beardsley would assess the care a carpenter exhibits in driving a nail as an aesthetic quality. We may, of course, be wrong about this. But, in any event, the carpenter's care would not be a case of a superfluity of expressiveness. Scott canvasses conceptions of expres- siveness other than Beardsley's. He cites Deborah Jowitt's claim that the movement in Rainer's Trio A "does express certain fac- tors about space, tensions in space, weight ..." (19). This does not strike us as what phi- losophers usually mean by "expression," nor is it what Beardsley appeared to have in mind. Physical relations like these are what Beardsley calls "local qualities," upon which expressive qualities supervene. But, if we are to suppose that this is the meaning of "ex- pression" in Beardsley's definition, we want first to observe that we fail to grasp how Room Service has a superfluity of these re- lations, and second to complain that the mere possession of these physical relations is too uninformative to be very useful in a defini- tion of either expression or dance, since ev- erything that exists has physical properties or supervenes on them. Scott also notes that dances can express philosophical ideas (20), as perhaps Rainer intended with respect to Room Service. This is certainly an acceptable usage of the word "express" in ordinary language. But under this usage, what gets expressed are proposi- tions. Yet clearly what Beardsley has in mind is the expression of qualities, like decisive- ness, not propositions like "the body pos- sesses its own muscular intelligence." More- over, propositional content is not had in terms of degrees of intensity, like superflu- ity. Thus, though Room Service may involve propositional expression, it does not involve qualitative expressiveness in any way di- rectly relevant to our reservations about Beardsley's definition. In fact, as Scott notes, one of the present authors (Carroll), has offered a rough car- tography of the ways that "express" might be used with respect to choreography and dance (21) In the narrow sense, what gets expressed in dance are anthropomorphic Dance Research Journal 31/2 (Fall 1999) 9</page><page sequence="5">qualities. But, Carroll maintains, there is a broader sense of expression-closer to the idea of communication-where what gets expressed are ideas or propositions. And, in addition, Carroll suggests a third sense, where what gets expressed is an anthropo- morphic quality that is attributed to a dance in virtue of the propositions it implies. In this sense, Room Service might be said to be "philosophical" in virtue of the theme of bodily intelligence that it advances. Scott suggests that Room Service can be called expressive in terms of these last two senses, and, therefore, is not a fair counterexample to Beardsley's theory. If Carroll thinks oth- erwise, Scott suggests, then he has contra- dicted himself (22). Of course, we agree that Room Service can be said to be expressive in the broader senses of the term. But for solid textual rea- sons we do not think that either of these is the sense of expression that Beardsley had in mind in his definition. Beardsley is talk- ing about anthropomorphic properties that supervene on movements, not propositions implied by movements nor anthropomorphic labels that can be associated with the propo- sitions contextually implied by the dance as a whole. In addition to his attempt to assimilate Room Service to Beardsley's position by al- leging that it is expressive, Scott also main- tains that Beardsley might accommodate it by counting it as mimetic (23). That is, why not suppose that the mattress-moving in Room Service is a representation of mattress- moving? This is a possibility that we rejected in our original article, but perhaps our argu- ment was too abbreviated to call sufficient attention to itself (24). We do not regard the mattress-moving in Room Service as a rep- resentation of a mattress-moving because, like Beardsley (25), we take representation to be intentional. Snow melting on a mountainside that resembles the face of Christ is not a representation of Christ, be- cause the resemblance to Christ is not in- tended. Given the best dance-historical re- sources available, we surmise that Room Service was not intended to be a representa- tion of a mattress-moving. It was a mattress- moving. It was an exercise in presentational, not representational, art, an exemplification of the bodily intelligence widely abroad in the world, but generally unacknowledged by theorists and artists. Thus, Room Service cannot be recuperated under the Beardsleyan category of a "dance working" as a repre- sentation of mattress-moving. Though Scott expends most of his en- ergy contesting our use of Room Service against Beardsley, oddly enough, he rejects Beardsley's definition. As we have seen, he suspects Beardsley's emphasis on superflu- ity, which, of course, accounts for why so many of his criticisms so often fail to con- nect with our objections to what Beardsley wrote. But by the end of his article, he also thinks, as we do, that Beardsley should not, for the purposes of defining dance, rely as heavily as he does on expressiveness (26). Since Scott's conclusions are so close to those of our original article, it might seem that Scott should welcome us as allies rather than adversaries. But he does not, and the reason is that he has his own theory of dance, about which we have already expressed some reserva- tions. On Scott's view, something is a dance only if it intentionally creates formal, rhyth- mical movement for the right intention (pre- sumably the intention to afford pleasure) (27). Earlier we criticized this proposal, us- ing what Scott describes as a "musical or generic notion of rhythm" (28). But Scott says our objections were off the mark be- cause, on his conception of rhythm, it is sim- ply any "ordered bodily movement." How- ever, we remain unconvinced that this is a promising line of speculation. Though Scott only intends this formu- lation as a necessary condition for dance, it is useful to note how very far away it is from providing anything like a sufficient condi- 10 Dance Research Journal 31/2 (Fall 1999)</page><page sequence="6">tion for dance. For Scott, something is a dance only if it is a creation of ordered bodily movement for the right intention. Well, this covers a vast amount of territory. An im- mense amount of human movement is or- dered, and if the ordering has to be presented for the sake of pleasure, then theater, sports, circus acrobatics, flirtatious sashaying, and much else falls under Scott's rubric. But even considered merely as a neces- sary condition for dance status, Scott's for- mulation leaves much to be desired. He has not really filled in what he means by the right intentions with any precision. Moreover, he has not told us whether the relevant bodily movement must appear to be ordered or whether it must just be ordered. One would think that, for Scott, the movement must appear to spectators to be ordered. But if this is how we are to interpret Scott's formula- tion, there are counterexamples to Scott's generalization. Much contact improvisation does not appear ordered, even to informed dance viewers. Long sections of Pina Bausch's dance works do not appear ordered, nor are they intended to appear so; in fact, they are intended to appear disordered. Simone Forti's Crawling, Dancenoise's Half a Brain, and Yoshiko Chuma's A Night at the Millionaire's Club are all designed to exhibit disordered bodily movement. And for an example from earlier times, consider Relache or Renaissance antimasques (29). Throughout the twentieth century especially, artists in various media have explored the uses of disorder for aesthetic purposes, and we see no reason why choreographers should be disbarred, by definition, from congruent experimentation. Responding to counterexamples like this, Scott may say that he is not talking about the appearance of ordered bodily movement. He merely requires that the movement be ordered, even if its order is not apparent. But this raises the problem of dances that are bad exactly because the movement in them is disordered: Such choreographic offerings may be deficient because their movement is not ordered, but we still want to categorize them as dance. Perhaps Scott will repair this hole in his theory by saying that anything that counts as a dance must be intended to appear to display ordered movement. And the failed dances we have just alluded to meet that requirement. But this reintroduces the kind of problem cases mentioned in the pre- ceding paragraph, since choreographers may intend to exhibit apparently disordered or non-ordered movement in their dances. Moreover, if Scott says of examples like these that they really are ordered and in- tended to be, since they are choreographed (ordered) to look disordered or non-ordered, then we must observe that Scott's formula- tion so far is circular. For if in order to es- tablish that certain movements are ordered, we need to establish that they are choreo- graphed, that is tantamount to saying that something is a dance only if it is a dance (that is, something choreographed). Admittedly, Scott has not worked out his theory of dance yet. Maybe he will be able to overcome the problems we've sketched. We hope we have given him some food for thought. And, in any event, we look forward to the future elaboration of his theory (30). Noel Carroll Monroe C.

Since our use of Room Service was aimed at problematizing Beardsley's requirement of a superfluity of expressiveness, we do not understand how Scott's attempted erasure of it from the discussion really addresses our debate with Beardsley. Scott is complaining about a counterexample designed to challenge a theory whose specific formulation he is not actually defending. Undoubtedly, Scott will accuse us of being overly preoccupied with what Beardsley said. But that, after all, is what we were objecting to. 12. Scott queries our description of the movement in Room Service by means of the locution "for its own sake." According to Scott, this is an error because the phrase only appropriately applies to "creatures, like animals." We are not convinced of Scott's philology here. People speak of valuing art objects for their own sake. Furthermore, since we are applying the phrase to movements that are human actions, our usage would appear to meet Scott's desiderata. See Scott 1999, 14. 13. Scott 1999, 15. 14. Scott 1999, 17. 15. We should add that we do not believe that the concept of expression is as unstable as Scott appears to believe. We think that there is a rough consensus among aestheticians that it applies primarily to anthropomorphic qualities. For a discussion of expression, see Noel Carroll, Chapter 2, Philosophy of Art: A Contemporary Introduction (London: Routledge, 1999). 16. Monroe C. Beardsley, "What is an Aesthetic Quality?" in Monroe C. Beardsley, The Aesthetic Point of View: Selected Essays, edited by Michael J. Wreen and Donald M. Callen (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1982 b), 93-110. 17. Beardsley 1982 b, 109. 18. In order to bolster his claim that Beardsley's concept of expressiveness can encompass Room Service, Scott cites some of Beardsley's examples of regional qualities. These include momentousness, mystery, majesty, abruptness, looseness, heaviness, decisiveness and languidity. We think that Scott's point here is to suggest that not all of Beardsley's examples are expressive in the sense of involving anthropomorphic qualities and that, therefore, Room Service may have some regional properties like these, thereby satisfying Beardsley's definition in terms of his notion of expressiveness. However, first it pays to note that many of these terms are straightforwardly anthropomorphic- languid, decisive, majesty, an air of momentousness. Secondly, the ones that appear as purely structural- heavy, loose, abrupt-are psychologically charged in the context where they are applied as comments on Anna Sokolow's Rooms. There, for instance, "heavy" means "psychologically fraught." If these labels were purely structural descriptions, they would not count as regional or aesthetic qualities for Beardsley. And, in any case, even if Room Service were said to be expressive because the relevant movements were heavy, that would still not disarm it as a counterexample to Beardsley's definition because they do not evince a superfluity of heaviness, beyond that required practically for mattress-moving. 19.

Noel Carroll, "Post-Modern Dance and Expression," in Philosophical Essays on Dance, edited by Gordon Fancher and Gerald Meyers (New York: Dance Horizons, 1981), 95-104. 22. Scott also complains that Carroll's overview of dance expression is flawed because it only allows attributions of expressive qualities to dance comparatively, not absolutely. This is not exactly right. Carroll acknowledges that certain anthropomorphic qualities in dance are possessed absolutely, for 12 Dance Research Journal 31/2 (Fall 1999)</page><page sequence="8">instance, in virtue of physiognomic features. But he also claims that some other expressive properties, like those associated with the propositional content of the work, may be based on homologies. Yet it does not seem problematic to us to contend that some expressive properties obtain comparatively. See Scott 1999, 16, and Carroll's response to Ziff, Philosophical Essays on Dance, 85.

Antimasques were an important genre in the seventeenth-century English courts of James I and Charles I. These dances were created specifically to contrast with the ordered movement of masques. Parodying and subverting all the virtuous qualities (especially the values of grace and harmony) championed in the masques, the antimasques often employed grotesque (sometimes even convulsive) movements and chaotic floor plans. (See International Encyclopedia of Dance, s.v. "Masque and Antimasque.") 30. In "Transcending the Beardsleyans," Scott (1999) says that earlier we misinterpreted his use of the notion of criterion. We said that he was using the specialized philosophical notion, whereas he says he meant no more by it than "good indicator." But in "Banes and Carroll on Defining Dance," Scott attacked our putative "criteria" by treating them as necessary and/ or sufficient conditions. For example, on page 12, Scott says "the Dantoesque approach in no way delimits Room Service necessarily as dance...." (emphasis added). Clearly, here we are in the neighborhood of the technical notion of criteria. And note that Scott does not address the issue of whether the considerations we raise are generally good indicators of dance. He repeatedly goes for the "philosophical jugular," interrogating our proposals on the model of necessary and sufficient conditions.
