<plain_text><page sequence="1">Philosophia Reformata 58 (1993) 187-191 TECHNICISM AND THE DYNAMICS OF CREATION Egbert Schuurman The large-scale introduction of information technology understandably raises many questions, especially because this technology affects nearly all of our cultural activities. Lyon's paper makes this influence abundantly clear and gives good illustrations of it in the fields of labour, education and commu nication. Also understandable is the changing position of the human person in the various cultural activities as the result of the influence of information tech nology. The impact of information technology on the human person is great indeed. Philosophers, sociologists and other scientists are at present dis cussing this new situation. The large question which this discussion raises concerns our culture as a whole and reads: Will this information technology enrich or impoverish our cultural life? The broad question concerning the human person may be formulated as follows: Does information technology offer a richer or a poorer approach to the human person? Some philosophers are of the opinion that the human person can be defined much better in terms of the information technology than the earlier technological models such as the clock or the steam engine. Increasingly humankind is qualified as an information processor. Such an approach toward humankind usually begins with speaking anthropomorphically about the computer in order to end up with speaking "computeromorphically" about humankind. Thus, by beginning with a comparison between humankind and the computer, the outcome is usually that the computer determines how humankind is defined so that the human person is the loser and the computer the winner. In this brief paper I want to explain how the course of this philosophical argu mentation can be understood, to what consequences it leads, and, finally, which contribution a reformational philosophy might have to offer in this discussion. My approach differs slightly from that of David Lyons in his paper, but I think my paper will complement his. The following points I shall highlight in my paper: The ground motive of Western thought is technicism (1); this technicism leads to the technicaliza tion of nature, society and the human person (2); this process of technicism and technicalization is a dialectical one which as such parasitizes on the dynamics of creation (3); a reflection on the meaningful dynamic of the creation offers a liberating perspective for information technology and for the mutual relation between the human person and the computer (4). 1. Technicism Along with a growing number of thinkers — among whom Martin Heideg ger, Max Horkheimer, Jacques Ellul, H. Staudinger and H. Sachsse may be mentioned — I call the spiritual background of the technological culture and especially of the information society, technicism. From a Reformational</page><page sequence="2">188 Ε. SCHUURMAN perspective technicism must be understood as arising from human autono my, that is, as being motivated by the attempt to grasp the origin, existence and destination of all things in terms of human designs. Presentday tech nicism is influenced by science to such a degree that we must speak of a scientistic technicism. As a result of this combination of science and tech nology, the whole of reality is now interpreted in the categories of modern technology, especially of information technology. Technicism also points to the exclusive role which scientific-technological methods and procedures are given in dealing with every imaginable problem which confronts humankind. In other words, technicism spells out humankind's claim to be its own creator and redeemer. The deepest spiritual root of technicism lies in humankind's fall into sin. The driving force of this Fall has been magnified, however, in the spiritual movements of the Renaissance, Modern Philosophy, the Enlightenment, Positivism and Marxism. At present this force manifests itself in the various kinds of materialism, pragmatism and system philosophies. Technicism finds its fulfilment in the information theories and system theories which lie at the root of the information technology. In view of the foregoing, everything in reality is reconstructed in the categories of information theory: nature, society and even the human person. The human person is seen as an information processor, something which is better reconstructed by means of the information theory. Hence, the theory of human autonomy leads ultimately to a technicistic view of the human person. Reformational philosophy, as I will presently show, does not reject the possibilities of information technology when it confesses that humankind is created in the image of God, and that it ought to be motivated by a divine calling. This technology needs to developed, however, within a normative perspective, one which is directed in accordance with the meaningful dyna mics of the creation. 2. Technicalization What are the consequences of technicism? It has had a tremendous impact of a normative nature. That is to say, all of our norms are seen to be derived from technology itself and, in our time, from information technology. Technicistic thinking is consequently projected into reality. Everything is seen to bear the characteristics of technology, of information technology in particular. The characteristics are the same as those which hold for science, especially for information theory or systems science. Hence the consequences of technicism is the technicalization of all reality: of nature, society and the human person. This process of technicalization is promoted by an elite of scientists and engineers who are not unusually performing their tasks under the guidance of economical and political powers. Moreover, technicism is attractive to a large sector of the population on account of its material promises and concrete results. In conclusion, technicism comes to fullness in the technicalization of culture which in turn is strongly encouraged by a materialistic frame of mind. However, as this process continues and gains in intensity, so its dark sides</page><page sequence="3">TECHNICISM AND THE DYNAMICS OF CREATION 189 become ever more visible. The consequences of technicalization of nature is already known. When, instead of being conceived of as a God-given creation, nature is thought to be some great technical machine, such thought first leads to the reduction of nature to categories derived from this thought, but, worse, it culminates often in the very destruction of nature. As this process of technicalization continues and intensifies through the information technology it is not only destructive of nature and the environment, but also of human society. The "technological culture" or the "information society" is artificial, cold, uniform and abstract. All the diversity which characterizes a real human society has been levelled off. Such a society moves in the direction of a totalitarianism. There is no room for the particular and the unique; it is made devoid of the richness of variety and diversity. These characteristics are apparent in such diverse fields as modern urban planning, domestic architecture, health care, social work, politics and economics. Moreover, they are making an ever stronger impact on production processes, education and communication. In the final analysis it is the human person who is threatened in his very humanity by this ongoing process of technicalization. By first speaking of the computer in anthropomorphic terms, as I noted earlier — speaking of computers as learning, thinking, speaking, etc. — secular thinkers end up by speaking of the human person in terms of the computer. These thinkers have abstracted the person from the concrete relations in which the Bible sees him or her living, and which a Christian philosophy will attempt to account for in a theoretical sense. The result is that the human person is "reified"; computer technology and information technology determine how human nature is to be defined. Far from offering an enrichment of our understanding of humankind, this way of defining human nature is a reduction which may ultimately lead to the very destruction of humankind. Even now a increasing coldness, isolation, alienation and loneliness marks present-day humanity. The distinctiveness, uniqueness, individuality and creative responsibility of the human person are eliminated from the full realm of experience. Modern humankind is internally torn and fragmented; it is becoming abstract and uniform. Those who seek to find their life in technology will lose it. 3. The Dialectic ofTechnicalization as a Parasitism of the Creation Dynamics Technicism seeks to solve all problems facing humankind through the use of scientific-technological control, by the process of technicalization. Its final aim is to build a "counter-creation," in which humankind is lord and master over all things and possessor of an unlimited material prosperity. Many of the promises which technicism holds out appear to have been fulfilled. Human power and domination have increased enormously. However, the experience that human existence is threatened has not departed; on the contrary, a strong sense of impotence pervades our lives. Humankind may still suppose itself to be the master of its own fate through the scientific-technical control which it has brought forth, but by having submitted itself to this control, the experience of being subject to a real threat has at the same time made itself master of human life.</page><page sequence="4">190 Ε. SCHUURMAN Thus, the technological development under the guidance of technicism has brought about a tension between humankind and technology. Humankind no longer feels itself in control of technological development. Even some scientists and engineers have lost this feeling. Others have been blunted by technological thinking and the process of technicalization which results from this thinking. All appear to be victims. However, human nature cannot deny its original qualification and destiny. Hence a conflict arises between technology and humankind. Humanity resists the threat posed by technicism; its will for freedom contradicts all attempts to reduction and determinism. The human person protests any infringement of its freedom and does not submit willingly to the laws of determinism. This dialectic of technology and humankind was first prominent in philo sophical circles which adhered to technicism. Since the Enlightenment this dialectic has taken on a cultural scope since the actual process of technica lization got under way at that time. The dialectic of technicistic thinking has increasingly become the dialectic present in culture, society and even in humankind. On the basis of a freedom which recognized no limits, human kind has constructed a scientific-technological society, an "information society" which unleashes forces over which humankind has no control, and which, in fact, threaten its freedom. This conflict also makes clear why at present the opportunities of information technology for individual use is stressed so much. In reality, however, these opportunities do not relate to cultural power in its anti-normative consequence, they rather have an anarchistic influence on culture. This dialectic makes clear that the "counter-creation" of technicism cannot be self-supporting; it must find its support in the God-given creation. As a result technicism and technicalization may lead to the reduction and even destruction of some aspects of human life, they can never issue into the full destruction of human nature. Still, it may be impossible for humankind to separate itself completely from the given creation and its dynamics of meaning, humankind can indeed resist the direction implied in this meaning-dynamic and, therefore, try to bend the course of history. The result of this resistance is, however, that the human person loses his humanity and dignity in several respects. This loss does not only apply to consumers — a loss which Lyon stresses in his paper — in the fields of education and communication, but also to the scientists and engineers. The dialectic of technicalization, we must remind ourselves, always makes use of the material of the given creation, even though humankind may impose upon this original meaningfulness, its own meaning. The original dynamics of creation then turns into an original dialectic within creation. Technicism and technicalization parasitize on the dynamics of meaning in the creation and at the same time perverts the true meaning of nature, society and humankind. 4. Liberating Perspective A liberating perspective opens up as soon as humankind rejects the idea of autonomy, when people acknowledge that they are created in the image of God and that they have to fulfill their cultural tasks coram Deo. In submitting</page><page sequence="5">TECHNICISM AND THE DYNAMICS OF CREATION 191 myself to the meaning-dynamics of the creation and confess that God leads history in Jesus Christ, I accept my calling responsibly. This perspective offers resistance to technicism and to the dialectic of technicalization. Acknow ledging that creation does disclose its riches to human cultural activity, there is also a perspective for information technology as a legitimate part of this disclosure. Concretely this perspective shows how humankind must submit to the given normative principles as expression of the meaning-dynamics. These principles hold for the cultural and supra-cultural modalities. Humankind submits to these principles when it positivizes or works them out in the concrete situation in which it finds itself. Submission to these principles is the beginning of human responsibility. They direct the human person and make him or her wise in the perspective of the fullness of the disclosure of meaning towards which all the structures of creation point, even though he or she will remain involved in the struggle against the "thorns and thistles," the dialectic which is the consequence of the fall into sin. Human responsibility in relation to information technology will consist of doing justice to the new developments, but at the same time to resist the growing process of technicalization, for example in the computerization of labour, education, and communication. This perspective gives a certain har mony between technological power and human individuality and creativity. The systematics of Reformational philosophy is, in my opinion, very relevant and useful in coming to terms with information technology. The notion of a "religious ground motive" such as it has been developed in this philosophy helps to de-ideologize and de-mythologize information tech nology and the modality structure of this philosophy shows us how to recognize the limitations of this technology while at the same time defining the responsible potentials within these limits. Rather than defining humankind in terms of information technology, humankind ought to define information technology. This latter defining may well begin by pointing out that the term "information" in "information technology" is in a certain sense misleading. "Information" means in this context "signal-transmission" and is as such a reduction and abstraction of the usual meaning of the term. Keeping this reduction and abstraction in mind, we become aware that computers can help humankind. Strictly speaking computers cannot add and subtract or perform any other simple mathematical function. It is simply wrong to say that a computer can "think" or that they have "artificial" intelligence. Within the context of human responsibility — that is, in the context of the meaning-dynamics of the creation — we can make meaningful use of the limited and nevertheless far-reaching possibilities of computer technology. In the light of this responsibility, information technology need not be a threat to humankind. The human person can bear his responsibility in a creative way, also in the fields of labour, education and communication, because he or she need not and indeed does not depend on this technology. Rather this technology depends on us. In this liberating perspective we have more opportunities to be human with the use of this technology than without it.</page></plain_text>
