<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE MABARUMA PHASE: A RETURN TO THE MORE PROBABLE INTERPRETATION DONALD W. LATHRAP IN A RECENT publication Evans and Meggers have accused me of reinterpreting their work in an erroneous manner on two separate occasions (Evans and Meggers 1964). In one instance (Lathrap 1963a), I suggested that the Machalilla complex of Coastal Ecuador might be a member of the same ceramic tradition which also gave rise to Early Tutishcainyo and Late Tutishcainyo in the central Ucayali Basin in Peru. In the other case (Lathrap 1964), I offered what appeared to me to be a more reason- able seriation of the excavated levels of the Mabaruma phase of northwestern British Guiana and suggested that the age of the Mabaruma phase had been underestimated by a large factor. Evans and Meggers make only brief mention of the Machalilla note and leave me in a Kafkaesque predica- ment, accused of unspecified "inaccuracies" (Evans and Meggers 1964: 83). It seems best not to respond to these charges until their exact nature is made clear. Our controversy over the Mabaruma phase requires more detailed treatment. Evans and Meggers attempt to give the impression that they have refuted me on all aspects of my comments on the Mabaruma phase. Their rejoinder is detailed and requires a point by point analy- sis. Basically their argument divides itself into three parts: (1) that Lathrap's seriation is wrong; (2) that even if Lathrap's seriation isn't wrong, it is not sig- nificantly different from that presented by Evans and Meggers; and (3) that even if it were right and signifi- cantly different from the Evans-Meggers seriation, there would still be no basis for redating the beginning of the Mabaruma phase. Each of these segments of the argu- ment will be considered in turn. Initially my interest in the seriation of the Mabaruma phase presented by Evans and Meggers grew as a part of a more general interest in trends of vessel shape within various branches of the Barrancoid tradition. I was attempting to check the possibility of a relationship be- tween Hupa-iya, a highly distinctive ceramic complex in- trusive into the middle time range of the central Ucayali cultural sequence in eastern Peru, and various members of the Barrancoid tradition. It appeared that within the Barrancoid phases of the lower Orinoco there was a steady decrease in the importance of extremely broad, heavy labial flanges. The continuous labial flange so typi- cal of Barrancas (Cruxent and Rouse 1958-1959: Vol. 2, Fig. 190) changes in shape and decreases in massiveness</page><page sequence="2">FACTS AND COMMENTS 559 in the course of the gradual transition from Barrancas to Los Barrancos (for Los Barrancos see Cruxent and Rouse 1958-1959: Vol. 2, Fig. 193), or else the continuous, sim- ply incised flange of Barrancas (Cruxent and Rouse 1958-1959: Vol. 2, P1. 93, No. 16 and Pl. 94, No. 1) be- comes the discontinuous, elaborately incised lug so typi- cal of Los Barrancos (Cruxent and Rouse 1958-1959: Vol. 2, P1. 95, Nos. 13, 17, 21, 22, 23; P1. 97, No. 6; Fig. 191, Nos. 3, 4). There also would appear to be an increase of simple rims unmodified by the addition of either flanges or lugs. These trends appeared to be amply demonstrated by the published illustrations of Cruxent and Rouse, and the definition of the Los Barrancos ma- terials was made more complete by the earlier publica- tion of Osgood and Howard (1943). However, since the report on the lower Orinoco materials was preliminary, the data pertinent to these trends were not quantified by Cruxent and Rouse; and there remained the possibility that the materials illustrated by Cruxent and Rouse were not quantitatively representative of the samples involved. (I strongly doubted that such was the case from the out- set, but the materials as published did not completely remove that possibility.) With these trends in mind, I turned to the smaller Mabaruma collections, which had been more completely published, with the hope of finding a more complete documentation and quantification of these trends. At first I was disappointed, for while labial-flanged bowls showed a perfectly continuous decrease in the Abary phase of the eastern British Guiana coast (this state- ment is based on a series of calculations made from the tables relevant to the Abary phase in Evans and Meggers 1960), the history of this vessel form showed a very unsatisfactory series of near disappearances and sudden revivals in the Mabaruma sequence as seriated by Evans and Meggers (1960, Fig. 49 and relevant tables). Other specific features of form and decoration, described and tabulated by Evans and Meggers, also exhibited the same kind of hiccupy distribution through time, when those data were ordered by the seriation which they proposed. It was the combined weight of these observations which led me to examine the basis of the Mabaruma seriation with particular care. Even if one is willing to accept completely the theory and method of Ford's type of ceramic seriation, the seria- tion of the Mabaruma phase as presented by Evans and Meggers (1960, Fig. 48) is not particularly convincing. Only one of the four major plain types shows the ex- pectable kind of trend through time, while the other three types show patterns which can only be described as eccentric when judged by Fordian theory. The verbali- zation of the situation (Evans and Meggers 1960: 118- 19) glosses over most of the difficulties and in some par- ticulars is downright inaccurate. It is simply not true that "All the cuts show a similar pattern of ceramic change." With regard to several cuts, there are no clear trends for particular ceramic types. What, for instance, is the trend of Hotokwai Plain in N-1, Cut 1, of Maba- ruma Plain and Hosororo Plain in N-4, Cut 1, or of Mabaruma Plain and Hosororo Plain in N-13, Cut 1? Since the trends of the individual ceramic types in the individual cuts are by no means clear, the seriation of these cuts on the basis of temper categories alone is by no means inevitable, no matter how closely one follows the methodology of Fordian seriation. In short, the com- plete reliance on temper categories for the purpose of chronological ordering does not lead to a single, unam- biguous solution in the case of the Mabaruma phase. The deficiencies of the Mabaruma seriation as pre- sented by Evans and Meggers become especially clear if it is compared with the seriation which they offer for the Abary phase (1960, Fig. 77). Here it is true that the total seriation conforms beautifully to the expectations of the Fordian model, and the major trends implied by the total seriation are all clearly indicated in the indi- vidual cuts which went into the seriation. Here the appli- cation of Ford's methodology leads to a single unam- biguous solution, and the validity of the seriation is strengthened by the fact that the various vessel shapes also show consistent trends when the cuts are seriated in this way. It was only after this detailed examination of the Mabaruma seriation that I raised the question as to whether the differences between the several plain-ware types which dominated the seriation were strictly chrono- logical in their implication. It appeared to me that these distinctions in nonplastic inclusions might in part repre- sent differences in the availability of particular materials in various parts of the region occupied by the peoples responsible for Mabaruma style pottery. With these ideas in mind I then prepared two seria- tion tables, one based only on features of shape and the other based only on features of decoration. In these tables specific features of shape and decoration were made to show consistent trends through time and mini- mal temporal duration, but the stratigraphic relation- ships inherent among the levels of the several cuts were at no time violated (Lathrap 1964, Tables 1 and 2). Since I am still convinced that my seriation of the Mabaruma phase is a far more accurate reflection of time than is the seriation offered by Evans and Meggers, I feel that each of their objections to my seriation must be answered in full. Evans and Meggers object, with a certain amount of justice, to my use of the term "minor" for the differences among their plain-ware types. What I intended to indi- cate was a belief that these distinctions were of minor cultural import rather than that the four types were difficult to distinguish. In three out of the four types involved I still feel that the differences are minor, since they consist only in the quantity and nature of the water- worn sand present in or added to the clay. Unless Evans and Meggers have made a detailed survey of the avail- ability of particular kinds of sand and particular admix- tures of sands and clay in the vicinity of their sites, I fail to see how they can be so certain as to the cultural sig- nificance of these distinctions. The case of Hotokwai Plain is clearly different, for steatite was intentionally</page><page sequence="3">560 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [ VOL. 31, No. 4, 1966 mined, crushed, and added to the clay. Here there is indication of strong cultural preference. It would be of greatest importance to know something about the availability of steatite in various parts of the Mabaruma area. Evans and Meggers point out that the addition of steatite temper makes a ware which is particularly dis- tinctive in appearance, and for reasons which will develop presently I am delighted to grant them this point. Evans and Meggers make a very good case for the existence of chronologically significant variations in the popularity of the steatite-tempered ware, Hotokwai Plain, among the various levels and sites on the upper Aruka River. They make an even better case for chronologically significant trends in the popularity of Koberimo Plain, the ware tempered with micaceous sand, in the cluster of sites near the mouth of the Aruka River: "For exam- ple, mica-tempered Koberimo Plain is absent at N-1 ex- cept in the upper two levels, where it reaches only 1.4% frequency. At N-12, which occupies the same small hill, it increases to 27.8%" (Evans and Meggers 1964: 83). An examination of their site map (Evans and Meggers 1960, Fig. 22) indicates that they must mean N-19 rather than N-12 in this discussion, but once this substitution is made, their statement is certainly accurate. In neither of these cases, however, is there a demon- stration that these trends hold for the whole of the Maba- ruma area, rather than for merely localized subregions within it, and the distribution of the sites in question suggests the plausibility of such regional variation. No- where in the sample presented by Evans and Meggers is there evidence that Hotokwai Plain reached a high level of popularity on the lower Aruka, or that Koberimo Plain ever showed a peak of popularity on the upper Aruka. There is nothing in the data presented by Evans and Meggers which would rule out the possibility that the trend toward greater use of Hotokwai Plain on the upper Aruka was synchronous with the trend toward greater use of Koberimo Plain on the lower Aruka. Indeed the essential identity of the upper levels of N-12, Cut 1 and the upper levels of N-13, Cut 1, with reference to features of vessel shape and decoration, argues strongly that the top levels of these two sites are at least roughly con- temporaneous. Each of these two localized trends in tempering materials is mirrored as well in my seriation as in that of Evans and Meggers, so that the existence of these localized trends cannot be used as evidence against my seriation. Evans and Meggers are correct in pointing out that the two seriations of the Mabaruma sequence differ only in the positioning of the levels of site N-13, Cut 1. Local- izing the area of our disagreement allows a more careful examination of the basis of disagreement. Because of the relatively high percentages of the steatite-tempered ware, Hotokwai Plain, in the lower two levels of N-16, Cut 1, and the very high percentages of this type in the upper two levels of N-13, Cut 1, Evans and Meggers felt compelled to place these four levels in adjacent slots in their seriated sequence. In my seriation of the top levels of N-13, Cut 1, I was more impressed by the very large quantity of sherds showing features of shape and decoration, which Evans and Meggers agree are charac- teristic of the last phase of the Mabaruma sequence, and which they emphasize are typical only of the final and very late phase of the long ceramic sequence on the lower Orinoco, Apostadero. Because of the very heavy loading of these Apostadero-like materials in the upper two levels of N-13, Cut 1, I felt that they belonged at the very end of the chronological sequence. Since the lower two levels of N-20, Cut 1, almost completely lack such late, Apostadero-like, features, I felt that the seriation should express a considerable temporal distance between the lower two levels of N-20, Cut 1, and the upper two levels of N-13, Cut 1. In criticizing my seriation Evans and Meggers have made the claim that the marked differences in the occur- rence of features of shape and decoration which are apparent between the upper two levels of N-13, Cut 1, and the lower two levels of N-20, Cut 1, are the result of nothing more than sampling error: "Since the total sherd sample per level is not large and since there are four decorated types represented, we felt that the possi- bilities of error derived from so small a sample were considerable, and consequently the trends could be con- sidered at best only suggestive. We do not take the posi- tion that shape and decoration show a 'capricious distri- bution through time' (p. 358) but rather that evidence for shape and decoration may show such a distribution because of the small size of the available sample" (Evans and Meggers 1964: 83). Since Evans and Meggers claim that the differences between the upper two levels of N-13, Cut 1, and the lower two levels of N-20, Cut 1, are due only to sampling error, that is to say, since they are invoking the "null hypothesis" as an explanation, an evaluation of their supposition by means of established statistical procedures seems indicated. Since the point in question is the sta- tistical significance of the pattern of distribution of the Apostadero-like traits in the upper two levels of N-13, Cut 1, and the lower two levels of N-20, Cut 1, it is possible to prepare two by two chi-square tables from my reorganization of the data with relative ease. The Apos- tadero-like features of shape and decoration are clearly segregated out in the seriation which I have presented. In Table 1 of my 1964 paper the three categories of shape at the right side of the table are Apostadero-like (com- pare Lathrap 1964, Table 1, with Cruxent and Rouse 1958-1959: Vol. 2, Fig. 196). In Table 2 of the 1964 paper the Apostadero-like features of decoration are con- centrated in the seven columns at the right-hand side of the table. (This allocation of features of decoration is an oversimplification, for I strongly suspect that the Evans- Meggers category Kaituma Incised and Punctate, Motif 1, needs reanalysis in terms of the present discussion. I suspect that not all of it should be placed in the Apostadero-like category. In treating all of this group as Apostadero-like, I am reducing the degree of distinc- tiveness between the top two levels of N-13, Cut 1, and the lower two levels of N-20, Cut 1, and this tends to</page><page sequence="4">FACTS AND COMMENTS 561 TABLE 1 [LATHRAP].

In short, the oversimpli- fication works in favor of the hypothesis of Evans and Meggers rather than in my favor). Table 1 of the present paper indicates the value of chi,square with reference to features of shape, while Table 2 of the present paper indicates the value of chi-square with reference to fea- tures of decoration. In calculating the value of chi-square for these two tables, standard procedures, including the Yates correction, were used (Moroney 1956: 249-55). Since Evans and Meggers have claimed that features of shape and decoration are too rare in the samples they use to be statistically significant, it is interesting to see the level of statistical significance of these differences when the sample is halved, since only those sherds showing features of shape are treated in Table 1, while only those sherds showing features of decoration are used in Table 2. The value of chi-square for Table 1 is 9. Since two- by-two tables allow one degree of freedom only, the probability of the null hypothesis, the hypothesis which Evans and Meggers have assumed by seriating these two pair of levels together, is between .1% and 1% but much closer to the former than the latter. The value of chi- square for Table 2 which treats features of decoration is 34. A chi-square of 34, in a test with one degree of free- dom, lies so far beyond the .1% level of probability that its precise value is not worth calculating. Whatever the explanation of the differences between the bottom of N120, Cut 1, and the top of N-13, Cut 1, may be, they are not due to sampling error. Until I am presented with strong evidence to the contrary, I will continue to regard these great differences in vessel form and decoration as probably indicative of a considerable chronological gap between these two samples. Next to be dealt with is the contention of Evans and Meggers that the differences between my seriation and theirs are of relatively minor significance. On the basis of the preceding discussion and on the basis of evidence which will be presented in the concluding section of this note, it is possible to present thumbnail sketches of the two seriations which will point up their differences sharply. In the Evans-Meggers seriation, features which in the lower Orinoco are characteristic of Barrancas dominate the earliest part of the sequence and show a gradual decline from that point on to the middle of the sequence. At the midpoint of their seriated chronology all those features of shape and decoration which are diagnostic of the protohistoric to historic phase on the lower Orinoco, Apostadero, make a sudden appearance in overwhelming quantity, while Barrancas-like features disappear. A little farther on in the sequence the Apos- tadero-like features disappear, and there is a significant resurgence of Barrancas-like features. At the very end of their sequence Apostadero-like features again become dominant and Barrancas-like elements again decrease to the vanishing point. In the seriation I have offered, the earliest period is dominated by features typical of the Barrancas style on the lower Orinoco. From this point on, such features show a gradual but steady decline in frequency so that they have completely disappeared by the end of the se- quence. The middle part of my seriation shows an evo- lution in style which to a degree parallels the evolution TABLE 2 [LATHRAP].

The Los Barrancos sample includes all decorated labial flanges examined. The Mabaruma sample includes all labial flanges illustrated by Evans and Meggers (1960) with the widths estimated from scales provided. of Barrancas to Los Barrancos on the lower Orinoco, but this middle segment of the Mabaruma sequence does not resemble Los Barrancos in any specific details of style. Toward the end of my seriated sequence, and not before this point, the traits characteristic of the protohistoric and historic periods on the lower Orinoco make their appearance and largely swamp elements of shape and decoration carried over from the previous segment of time. My view of chronology and cultural process is sufficiently fine-grained so that I am forced to regard the two chronologies outlined above as remarkably and sig- nificantly divergent. I would suggest that any view of chronological and cultural matters which is so coarse- grained as to regard these two inferred sequences as inter- changeable is of little anthropological utility. Evans and Meggers explicitly state that, among all of the suggestions offered in my 1964 paper, they find my derivation of Early Mabaruma from Barrancas rather than Los Barrancos the most objectionable and unaccept- able. They also argue that the derivation of Early Mabaruma from Barrancas rather than Los Barrancos is not a by-product of my reseriation of the Mabaruma ma- terials, since we are in complete agreement as to the seriation of the early part of the sequence. It is easy to answer this last objection, which clearly does not repre- sent any important disagreement among us. Until I had made the reorganization of the Mabaruma data on vessel forms which ultimately was to become Table 1 of my 1964 paper, I had not realized that bowls with broad, heavy, labial flanges made up from 50% to 80% of Early Mabaruma vessels. This is equally true with my seria- tion of the data or with Evans and Meggers' seriation of the data, but it is far more evident from my Table 1 (1964) than it is from their presentation of the data. Once I realized that 50% to 80% of Early Mabaruma vessels had broad labial flanges, the thought struck me that Early Mabaruma should be derived from a complex in which such flanged vessels were very numerous and had labial flanges of a form like that found in Early Mabaruma, rather than from a complex in which such flanges were rarer and took a different form. In this sense only, my suggestion that Early Mabaruma derives from Barrancas rather than from Los Barrancos was a by- product of the reseriation which I made. An examination of all published rim profiles of Bar- rancas and Los Barrancos convinced me that the domi- nant, labial-flanged bowl of Early Mabaruma could be duplicated repeatedly among the numerous Barrancas bowls with broad, heavy, labial flanges, whereas such flanges were rarer in Los Barrancos and tended to show a distinctively different profile. All relevant rim profiles relating to this point that were noted in my research were combined and published as Fig. 1 of my 1964 paper. I did not select materials favorable to my point of view TABLE 4 [LATHRAP].

It seemed evident to me, on the basis of these comparisons, that the early Maba- ruma materials were very like the Barrancas materials and quite unlike the Los Barrancos materials in total configuration of rim profile. All of my colleagues who examined Fig. 1 (1964) before it was submitted for pub- lication agreed with me on this point. Since these labial- flanged bowls make up over half of the Early Mabaruma sample, this seemed to me a point of some significance. In the face of this evidence, however, Evans and Meggers only comment: "The only argument he offers in support of a preference for the contemporaneity with Barrancas dated at 850 B.C. rather than Los Barrancos dated at A.D. 500, is his impression that one form of rim (referred to by Lathrap as 'labial flange') is typical of Barrancas but much less common in Los Barrancos (pp. 358-9)" (Evans and Meggers 1964: 83-4). Evans and Meggers do not choose to state whether they find the Los Bar- rancos rim profiles more similar to those of Early Maba- ruma than are the Barrancas profiles. It would appear that their stance requires of them some such affirmation at this point. I am chided by Evans and Meggers for presenting no evidence, not heretofore published, which would sup- port my suggestion of a close relationship between Maba- ruma and Barrancas. I did not do so because I felt that the evidence of the rim profiles was conclusive. How- ever, there exists considerable further evidence in ma- terials already published as to the close relationship between Mabaruma and Barrancas. For instance, it is possible to compare the description of the decorative motif in Mabaruma Incised, by far the dominant form of decorated ware in early Mabaruma, with the descrip, tion of the dominant form of decoration on Barrancas pottery. For Mabaruma Incised we are given the follow, ing: Motif: Decoration is limited to the broad upper rim surface and consists of one to three incised lines parallel to the circum- ference. Two parallel lines are most typical. At intervals, small lobes break the continuity of one or more of the incisions. These lobes are 1.5-6.5 cm. long and affixed to the outer edge of the rim so that they protrude upward and outward from 2-5 mm. (pl. 29, a-d, f-i). They appear to be evenly spaced so they divide the rim into halves or quarters. Incised lines, punctates, spirals, or perhaps even stylized faces with eyes and mouths may be seen in these lobes, and they are also bounded by a curved line. (Evans and Meggers 1960: 111). For what is numerically the most characteristic kind of decoration in Barrancas we are given the following: The number of instances of pure incision on the vessel wall is so great that it exceeds all other forms of decoration combined. Nearly 40 per cent of the sherds bear this kind of decoration. The lines are broad, shallow, and widely spaced, as befits the massive quality of the vessels. Most consist of only one or two parallel lines extending along the top of the flange or bordering the rim (P1. 94:1) (Cruxent and Rouse 1958-1959, Vol. 1: 228). A comparison of the illustrations cited in each instance shows that what is being described in the two discussions is essentially identical. In short, what is by far the most common form of decoration in the early part of Maba- ruma is identical to what is the most common form of decoration in Barrancas. If Evans and Meggers' descrip- tion and quantification of the Early Mabaruma material is accurate, and if Cruxent and Rouse's description of the Barrancas material is accurate, one is forced to the con- clusion that the two complexes are extremely closely re- lated, Mabaruma being only a slightly impoverished and rusticated version of Barrancas. Since Evans and Meggers have challenged me so strongly on these matters and demanded the presentation of new evidence, I have attempted to familiarize myself more fully with the nature of Barrancas and Los Bar- rancos materials. I wished to make absolutely certain in my own mind that the illustrations presented by Cruxent and Rouse are indeed typical and statistically representative of the complexes involved. While I was recently visiting Yale, December 10-14, 1964, Irving Rouse most graciously permitted me to examine ma- terials from the Saladero site which formed the basis for the distinction between the Barrancas and Los Barrancos styles. I made a cursory examination of much of this material and a detailed study of certain segments of it. I inspected all of the Barrancas materials from Excava- tion 1, Unit A-1, sketching and measuring all relevant rim profiles, and sketching most of the incised designs relevant to the present discussion. Some of the Bar- rancas materials from Excavation 6 were also subjected to careful study. These detailed sketches and notes form the basis of my further comments on Barrancas. The Los Barrancos materials from Excavation 7, Unit S-1, were all treated in the same manner, and my notes on these form the basis of my comments on Los Barrancos. On the basis of this four-day study it can be stated emphatically that the range of rim profiles illustrated by Cruxent and Rouse for these two complexes is both typical and representative. The very heavy, broad, labial flanges typical of Barrancas make up a very large per- centage of the total sample of Barrancas rim sherds and thus parallel the situation in Early Mabaruma. The com- mon forms of flanged rims in the Los Barrancos sam- ple are those illustrated in Fig. 1 of my 1964 paper. Other rims have extremely broad, horizontal shelves added to them, but these occur as elaborately decorated, discontinuous lugs, rather than as continuous flanges with simple design layouts, as is the case with the Early Mabaruma and Barrancas materials. Los Barrancos flanges average considerably narrower than Barrancas or Mabaruma flanges and are relatively narrower when compared with the thickness of the vessel walls from which they project. While Barrancas and Early Mabaruma flanges are frequently four times as wide as the vessel wall is thick, Los Barrancos flanges average about twice as wide. Both in terms of the mode of abso- lute width and in terms of relative proportion Mabaruma flanges resemble Barrancas materials and not Los Bar- rancos materials. The reader is referred to Table 3 for quantitative materials relative to this assertion. In attempting to refute my position on the derivation of Mabaruma, Evans and Meggers make a number of statements which simply are not true. The first matter to be considered is the contention of Evans and Meggers</page><page sequence="7">564 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [ VOL. 31, No. 4, 1966 that Early Mabaruma lines up with Los Barrancos rather than Barrancas in terms of vessel-thickness (Evans and Meggers 1964: 84). It is true that there are some rare vessel forms in Barrancas which run to tremendous size and very thick side walls. These monumental vessels include brewing urns with constricted necks. Hollow, well-finished topias, open at both ends, also produce quantities of thick sherds. If one adds the sherds from these rare vessels and fairly common topias to the much thinner sherds from the common Barrancas vessel forms, it is possible to get an inflated average for the thickness of Barrancas sidewalls. Cruxent and Rouse published such an inflated average (1958-1959, Vol. 1: 223). If one compares the range of vessel-wall thickness for labial flanged bowls in the Barrancas and Los Barrancos styles, one finds that the two styles do not differ in this respect; both groups of ceramics show essentially the same range and the identical mode at 9 mm (see Table 4 of the present paper). The characteristic thickness of Mabaruma bowls falls at about the same point. There is nothing to choose from in terms of vessel-wall thickness between Barrancas and Los Barrancos but, as has been pointed out earlier, Early Mabaruma lines up with Barrancas rather than Los Barrancos in terms of the massiveness of the labial flanges. Evans and Meggers (1964: 84) say that early Maba- ruma aligns itself with Los Barrancos because both are typified by an abundance of designs characterized by "incision closely spaced and frequently ending in dots." In the Mabaruma phase this kind of decoration is desig- nated as Kaituma Incised and Punctate, Motif 1. If Evans and Meggers had bothered to check their own seriation charts or mine, they would have noted that, within the segment of the seriated sequence which we all agree is early, there are exactly three sherds of this type. It is true that Mabaruma Incised sometimes shows dot finials. Exactly the same kind of weakly defined dot finial occurs repeatedly in the Barrancas sample as a part of exactly the same kind of design layout which Evans and Meggers (1960, P1. 29a) illustrate. All of the other design layouts which Evans and Meggers (1960, P1. 29) illustrate for Mabaruma incised have prototypes in the Barrancas sample, but not in the Los Barrancos sample. Evans and Meggers claim that Early Mabaruma is characterized by designs with closely spaced lines, so that it must be derived from Los Barrancos, yet the most common decorated type in Early Mabaruma is Maba- ruma Incised, characterized by broadly spaced lines. Fur- thermore, the one illustrated example of Aruka Incised for which we are given exact provenience data (Evans and Meggers 1960: 66; P1. 22) is the oldest example of that type from the sequence. Not only is it characterized by broadly spaced lines, but these lines are also organ- ized into a design which is classically Barrancas in style. In all of their contentions Evans and Meggers are not supported by their own published data. A further point which suggests a Barrancas rather than Los Barrancos derivation for Early Mabaruma is the fre- quent occurrence in both Early Mabaruma and Barrancas of moderately high, well-modeled, annular bases. In Los Barrancos such bases are rarer and tend to be stub- bier and more rudimentary. Considerable evidence has been shown which suggests that a derivation of Early Mabaruma from Barrancas is highly probable. It is worth considering a few factors which would make a derivation from Los Barrancos ex- tremely improbable. There are a number of cliches of Los Barrancos style which occur with such frequency that they are bound to be represented even in a very small sample of Los Barrancos sherds. There is one design which is typical of Los Barrancos labial flanges (Fig. 1 a-c). It occurs repeatedly and is the only really common design for this decorative field. The small ex- cised areas are continually used in other Los Barrancos design layouts. They are absent in Barrancas and are apparently absent in Early Mabaruma (at least they are not illustrated). Los Barrancos designs show, as Evans and Meggers point out, a particular fondness for dot finials, but the way in which these are used in Los Bar- rancos is highly specific to that style. Such dot finials are typical on forked lines or three pointed elements (Fig. 1 d, e). It is difficult to examine much Los Bar- rancos material without finding quantities of these forked lines, or three-ended lines, with dot finials (Cruxent and Rouse 1958-1959: Vol. 2, P1. 95, No. 6; P1. 96, Nos, 1, 8, 11, 13, 19, 21, 25, 26, 27; P1. 97, No. 2; Fig. 191, No. 4). Only one example was noted in the illustrated materials of the Mabaruma phase (Evans and Meggers 1960: P1. 18 b). Thus, while all Mabaruma incised and some Aruka Incised specimens have exact parallels in Bar- rancas, few if any of the earliest Mabaruma incised sherds show any of the stylistic mannerisms which are definitive of Los Barrancos. To derive Early Mabaruma from Barrancas one must envisage only the loss of a few of the rarer vessel shapes, such as brewing urns and double-spout-and-bridge bottles with anthropomorphic spouts. The extremely small sam- ple representing Early Mabaruma makes it possible that these lacks are apparent rather than real. To derive Mabaruma from Los Barrancos, one must first assume that the migrant potters forgot all of the highly specific cliches which define the Los Barrancos style and that, once they had been thus brainwashed, they reinvented all of the peculiarities of vessel shape and design layout which had been fashionable among their ancestors some 1000 years earlier. A final by-product of the examination of the collec- tions from the Saladero site should be mentioned be- cause it sheds further light on temporal relationships between Mabaruma and Barrancas. A steatite-tempered sherd was found well down in the richest Barrancas de- posits at the Saladero site (Excavation 1, Unit A-1, 75-100 cm.). The steatite temper is abundant, producing a highly distinctive paste. It is a rim sherd with labial flange and a typical Mabaruma Incised or Barrancas In- cised decoration (Fig. 1 f). If Evans and Meggers are correct about the high degree of specificity of Hotokwai</page><page sequence="8">FACTS AND COMMENTS 565 a ~~~- d e FIG. 1 [LATHRAP]. a-e, typical decorative treatment on labial flanges of Los Barrancos style, all from Saladero site, Excavation 7, Unit S-1; f, sherd with heavy steatite temper from a rich midden of Barrancas style materials, Saladero site, Excavation 1, Unit A-i, 75-100 cm. paste, this is probably a trade sherd from the Mabaruma area. If the Mabaruma people were already producing pottery to be traded to the peoples of the Lower Orinoco during the period when Barrancas culture was flourish- ing there, my previous estimate of the entrada of Maba- ruma culture into northeastern British Guiana is prob- ably too conservative. I would like to revise it backward to 700 or 800 B.C. There is no particular point in recapitulating what was said in my previous publication about the excellence of the Evans-Meggers monograph as a basis for arguing points of culture history. Would that other archaeolo- gists would provide a similar wealth of data in tabular form! Likewise there is no need to re-emphasize the points of theoretical interest inherent in our disagree- ment, which were discussed at length in my previous paper (Lathrap 1964). The careful reader may well have felt by now that there may be still other issues which have motivated this exchange, and it might be well to make these further issues explicit. Meggers and Evans have consistently taken the position that Tropical Forest culture was a relatively late development and a rather passive recipient of cultural influences from the areas of high civilization in South America: "It seems doubtful, however, that any other part of the South American continent will produce a sequence of the same antiquity and the same evolutionary completeness as has been out- lined in the Andean area, and a reasonably safe guess that this general area stimulated the evolution attained to a lesser degree in neighboring regions." (Meggers and Evans 1957: 605). Along with Sauer (1952), Cruxent and Rouse (1958-1959, Vol. 1: 263-4), and the Reichel-Dolmatoffs (1956: 269-75), I have expressed the opinion that developed agriculture and developed ceramics are older in some areas of the Tropical Low- lands than they are in the central Andes, and that the rise of root-crop agriculture in lowland South America was an important contributing factor to the rise of civili- zation in the central Andes (Lathrap 1962). Meggers and Evans thus have a built-in bias for compressing the duration of archaeological sequences in the tropical low- lands of South America east of the Andes. I admit to a bias for believing that such sequences are likely to be of significant duration, especially if they occur in a riverine environment. Since the Mabaruma sequence contains considerable trade pottery and is thus the focus of a net- work of cultural correlations which extends considerably beyond the limits of northwestern British Guiana, the dating of the beginning of this sequence is of considerable import to our most basic disagreement. I am suggesting that here and elsewhere the bias of Evans and Meggers has lead them to prejudge certain chronological problems and unconsciously to misrepre- sent the evidence. In one previous instance (Meggers</page><page sequence="9">566 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [ VOL. 31, No. 4, 1966 and Evans 1961), fully three phases are omitted from the discussion of an eight-phase sequence, while in another (Silva and Meggers 1963: 121) the suggested crossties between the Amazon Basin and the central Andes are contradicted by the available evidence (Lathrap: 1963b). The published record would appear to give evidence of such prejudice toward the Mabaruma materials. In a preliminary report on the British Guiana work, one finds the statement that the Mabaruma penetration into British Guiana was "apparently late" (Meggers and Evans 1955: 23), and it is clear from another section of this pre- liminary report that this judgment was made before any detailed comparisons were made between the Mabaruma and lower Orinoco materials (Meggers and Evans 1955: 13). Acknowledgments. The preparation of this manuscript was facilitated by a number of people. First, I wish to thank Irving Rouse for his most gracious permission to study the collections from the Saladero site. Without the study of these collections, a definitive answer to the basic question involved would not have been possible. Rouse also discussed the problem with me at length, and the manuscript has greatly benefited from these dis- cussions. Eugene Giles and Milford Wolpoff checked my applica- tions of the chi-square test. Frederic K. Lehman, Edward M. Bruner, and my wife, Joan W. Lathrap, read the manuscript, and all made helpful suggestions as to the proper organization and tone of such a rejoinder. I am, of course, completely responsible for any residual errors or improprieties. CRUXENT, J. M. AND IRVING ROUSE 1958-1959 An Archeological Chronology of Venezuela.
