<plain_text><page sequence="1">DIVINE LEGISLATION AS "CEREMONIAL SCRIPT": MENDELSSOHN ON THE COMMANDMENTS by ARNOLD EISEN My aim in this essay is to analyze a section of Moses Mendelssohn's Jerusalem largely ignored by previous readers. The treatise has generally been recognized as epochal in the history of modern Judaism, and Altmann, Guttmann, Rawidowicz, and Rotenstreich have therefore focused quite understandably on that which made it so:' the novel political theory set forth in part 1, or the controversial assertion near the start of part 2 that Judaism "knows of no revealed religion" in the common sense of that term, its uniqueness consisting only in the "divine legislation" revealed to the Jews at Sinai.2 Only Heinemann has made a serious attempt to unravel Mendels- 1.

I shall argue that speculative or not, unsub- stantiated or not, the theory of the mitzvot as a symbolic script is certainly no digression. It is rather the cornerstone of Mendelssohn's entire redefini- tion of Judaism, a passage of extraordinary relevance to contemporary discussion of symbol and commandment, and-to my mind-the most intrinsically interesting section of what Altmann rightly calls "this strange, powerful and unique book, the Jerusalem."6 Language, Alphabet, and the "Shasta of the Gentoos" The passage on the commandments follows directly upon Mendels- sohn's well-known pronouncement that he "recognize[s] no eternal truths other than those that are not merely comprehensible to human reason but can also be demonstrated and verified by human powers. .... I consider this an essential point of the Jewish religion and ... a characteristic difference between it and the Christian one."7 Mendelssohn's argument in the essay 2.

First, it marks the move from political theory to theology, from redefinition of the relation between church and state to redefinition of the meaning of Jewish obser- vance. Second, the statement contains a critique of Christianity which indi- cates that Mendelssohn has gone on the offensive-attacking on his own "turf" the anonymous Christian author whose pamphlet had provoked Mendelssohn to write Jerusalem in the first place.8 The "Searcher for Light and Right" had challenged Mendelssohn's oft-voiced contention that eccle- siastical bodies had no right to employ coercion of any sort, including excommunication. Mendelssohn had addressed this challenge in part 1 with a novel theory of contract exhaustively treated in the scholarly literature.9 That out of the way, he turns to the Searcher's more personal challenge. Mendelssohn's opposition to religious coercion, wrote his critic, clearly con- tradicted Jewish law. "How, then, can you, my dear Mr. Mendelssohn, remain an adherent of the faith of your fathers?" Perhaps he was not; per- haps he had "now come closer to the faith of the Christians ... thanks to which we have escaped coercion and burdensome ceremonies [lIistigen Zere- monien], and thanks to which we no longer link the true worship of God either to Samaria or Jerusalem, but see the essence of religion, in the words of our teacher, wherever the true adorers of God pray in spirit and in truth."' 0 It is this challenge which Mendelssohn seeks to answer in part 2 of Jeru- salem-chiefly with a concept of "ceremonies" which both detaches them from all coercion and renders them meaningful rather than "burdensome." Mendelssohn's defense of the commandments is the heart of his treatise, just as the commandments, in his view, were the heart of the religion which Jeru- salem symbolized. The Searcher had "cut [him] to the heart," Mendelssohn confesses, in reviving the calumny that a Jew could not at one and the same time maintain Enlightenment tolerance and Jewish commitment. Mendels- sohn's defense was rendered all the more difficult by the fact that the Searcher's notion of Judaism was "taken to be correct even by many of my coreligionists."" More than political theory was called for to refute him, then, more even than the easy answer that if the foundations of Judaism were destroyed by Enlightenment, Christianity--"built upon Judaism"- 8.

Ibid., p. 85.</page><page sequence="4">242 ARNOLD EISEN would surely collapse as well.'2 Mendelssohn must join the issue head-on with a definition of Judaism that satisfies the universalist criteria of rational religion while defending the need for "ceremonies." He has to reject the Searcher's either/or in favor of a both/and: a true worship, of utmost signif- icance to its practitioners, which holds nonetheless that true religion can be found "wherever the true adorers of God pray in spirit and in truth." Hence the well-known division of Judaism into "eternal truths" addressed to reason and common to all humanity; "historical truths" wit- nessed to by miracle and transmitted through tradition; and, finally, divine legislation [g6ttliche Gesetzgebungen]-ceremonial laws which "refer to, or are based upon, eternal truths of reason, or remind us of them, and rouse us to ponder them."'3 Judaism, unlike Christianity, knew of no revealed reli- gion, no symbolic books (symbolische Bacher), no articles of faith, no religious oaths. Its quintessence, if one existed at all, was well-captured by Hillel's admonition to the pagan who asked to be taught the entire law while standing on one foot. "Love thy neighbor as thyself... all the rest is com- mentary. Now go and study."'4 Mendelssohn's argument to this point has an all-too-obvious flaw. If all truths essential to human happiness are universally accessible, why is the divine legislation given the Jews at all necessary? If Christians get to the same destination by a far less "burdensome" route, why not take it? Con- versely, if the "ceremonial law" really is helpful (let alone indispensable) to the Jews in achieving full knowledge of God, how can Mendelssohn profess the equal opportunity of all human beings to know and serve the deity? It is the old problem of chosenness in a new guise. Further explanation is clearly required, and it comes in the passage with which this essay is concerned. The argument advances in three distinct steps, with two giant leaps in- between. In the first step, a very rabbinic Mendelssohn expounds upon the advantages of oral over written Torah and on the dangers of transforming the former into the latter. Oral teaching, he explains, always retains the potential for imperceptible adjustment to "changes of time and circum- stance." This flexibility is conferred by its freedom from the "rigid forms" of written characters which "must always remain the same." Unfortunately, Mendelssohn complains, the world has come to overemphasize the written 12. Ibid., p. 87. 13. Ibid., p. 99. 14. Ibid., pp. 100-102.</page><page sequence="5">MENDELSSOHN ON THE COMMANDMENTS 243 word. "Everything is dead letter; the spirit of living conversation has vanished." From this patent generalization Mendelssohn leaps to an extrav- agant conclusion: "hence it has come to pass that man has almost lost his value to his fellow man." Indeed, most people can no longer even under- stand how a person could "educate and perfect himself without a book.""' More is at stake here than meets the eye. Indeed, that is true of Jerusalem as a whole. Radical innovations are presented as simple expositions of time- honored tradition. Carefully packed argument, likewise, is often couched in casual prose which belies-in part by the exaggeration the author allows himself-the utter seriousness of his purpose. The passage just quoted does more than adumbrate the elegiac theme of innocence lost which will soon prove crucial to Mendelssohn. It does more even than hint at the prominent if oblique call in Jerusalem for a new sort of Jewish learning, now that the status of texts as such has so dramatically altered. More important, Mendelssohn in this passage introduces the idea, the metaphor, upon which his entire theory of the commandments rests: script. He is poised to argue that the inferiority of the written to the spoken word, and the dangers posed by writing, have necessitated the turn to a new sort of "script" written not in characters but in actions. The reference to speech and writing at this point recalls (and recasts) three previous passages in Jerusalem which should be reviewed briefly before proceeding. In the first, an explicit critique of Hobbes, Mendelssohn points out that language itself distinguishes (as Hobbes did not) between right and duty, power and obligation. It is a distinctive feature of all moral truths, he con- tinues, that "as soon as they are brought to light, they become so much a part of the spoken language and so connected with man's everyday notions that they become evident even to ordinary minds."l6 Note the emphasis upon "spoken language" and "everyday notions." Mendelssohn adheres as always to his conviction that God has distributed widely the means neces- sary to divine knowledge and human felicity. He blends a Rousseauian faith in the "noble savage" with skepticism that science and enlightenment have significantly advanced the moral achievement of humanity.'7 This thrust becomes clearer still when Mendelssohn, arguing against the 15.

See ibid., pp. 94-96, for the famous dispute with Lessing on the question of whether human progress toward perfection is inevitable.</page><page sequence="6">244 ARNOLD EISEN practice of requiring that oaths be sworn to this or that belief, notes that "the perceptions of internal sense" are far from stable. Many things for which I would die today may not be certain to me tomorrow. "How much confusion and indistinctiveness are bound to remain in the signification of words." Mendelssohn pleads that his readers not accuse him of skepticism, but immediately pleads guilty to that "disease of the soul," remarking on the difficulty even close friends have in truly communicating one with the other. Religious propositions clothed centuries ago "in words, in so-called sym- bols" [sogenannten Symbolen] cannot be relied upon to convey precise and shared meaning. Oral transmission at least carries its own commentary, explicit or not. Written language is apparently clear but actually opaque. How then swear to it? Coercion in matters of belief was therefore both pointless (people could lie) and utterly meaningless.'8 We are now able to understand Mendelssohn's denial that eternal truths were revealed at Sinai. Not only would it have been unfair for God to give some people a truth withheld from others. More important, eternal truths cannot be revealed in "word and script," but only in "nature and thing." We grasp them immediately, or by reasoning from such unmediated intuitions.'9 They cannot be made to fit inside "words or written characters which always remain the same, for all men and all times, amid all the revolutions of language, morals, manners, and conditions."20 Hence God's recourse to the "living script" of the commandments, and the rabbis' related reluctance to commit the Oral Law to writing. Hence too Mendelssohn's lament at the passing of traditional discipleship, the overreliance upon books. Step two of the argument plunges Mendelssohn into the "digression" proper, a speculation on the origins of language that unquestionably recalls Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality. Mendelssohn had translated that essay into German some thirty years earlier,21 and the problem-a staple of 18. Ibid., pp. 66-68. Rawidowicz points out that Mendelssohn himself expresses elsewhere the view attributed by him to a "skeptic" who, if a teacher of religion were to raise the dead, would "still know no more about eternal truth than I did before." Ibid., p. 98. See Rawidowicz, "Philosophy of Jerusalem," p. 91. 19. Mendelssohn thus takes the famous midrash about God's revelation at Sinai coming in seventy languages simultaneously to mean that the revelation was beyond language altogether. 20.

Rousseau, like Hobbes, Vico, and others, had been puzzled by the origins of language, pointing out the "inconceivable difficulties and the infinite time which the first invention of language must have cost." Essentially it was a problem of chicken and egg: people needed speech in order to think, but needed to think in order to discover the art of speech. No less important, speech was neither necessary nor possible without society, yet society could not exist without speech.23 Mendelssohn escapes from the circle by positing that concepts and signs developed more or less concurrently, while words came later on. Signs were thus necessary even before social interaction, because one could not make one's own way through the world without them. The inventor of the concept, Mendelssohn reasons (here recalling Hobbes), first noted the com- mon characteristics of the objects before him-say, three trees-and then "attach[ed] them to perceptible signs," i.e., to whatever signified tree for him. He did so not only in order to communicate his thoughts to others but "also to hold fast to them himself."24 The former need is self-evident. The latter accords with common associationist psychology, according to which thoughts are prompted by other thoughts or sense perceptions linked to them in the memory. Mendelssohn implicitly rejects Rousseau's contention that "general ideas can come into the mind only with the aid of words, and the understanding grasps them only through propositions."25 He also seems to draw, as Rousseau does not, upon a thinker (cited in Rousseau's own notes) who contended that nothing of human happiness would be lost if the "crowd and confusion of so many languages" had been replaced by explana- tion through "signs, movements, and actions."26 Rousseau seems to equate 22. Vico wrote that concerning "the origin of languages and letters ... there are as many opinions as there are scholars who have written on the subject."

I say "more or less" because Mendelssohn allows for what we might call "pre-concepts" preceding their attachment to signs. Thus Men- delssohn writes (p. 105) that without signs "man can scarcely remove himself one step from the sensual"-the "scarcely" allowing for the thought process preceding signs. 25.

His immediate point, once more, is skeptical in its bent. Concepts are inherently elusive, and must have been even more so when they first came into human use. The common characteristic of treeness or color or justice which I discerned yesterday may escape me today. I need a reminder in order to raise the concept to consciousness from my (subconscious) inven- tory. "Wise Providence" therefore attaches "abstract characteristics" to "perceptible signs [sinnliches Zeichen] which . .. at once recall and illu- minate" them.28 At first the signs were things themselves-like Swift's Lilli- putians, one carried around a chair to talk about a chair-or objects which-like the physician's snake-represented them. In the next stage these became images and then abstract lines, until finally the human race developed hieroglyphs and alphabets. One wonders, even before considering the problematic leap from writing to idolatry that Mendelssohn posits next, whether his warning that we can- not "force our concepts without disfiguring them" into "words and characters which invariably present the same rigid forms"29 was intended to encompass "words and characters" equally, speech as well as writing. If the translation of concept to language, treeness to the word "tree," is always inexact and inadequate, distortion will occur even without script itself. Writ- ing will only make a bad situation worse. Hence Mendelssohn's tolerance of such all-too-human error, including the error of idolatry, and his refusal to attempt to eradicate it through coercion. Or, Mendelssohn may have believed that oral discussion, precisely because it is open to the tricks of memory, offers a significant advantage over writing. It confers a fluidity on concepts themselves, enhanced over time by the changing usage and mean- ing of the words used in speech to transmit the concepts. Those changes ironically serve truth, which is ungraspable by more direct means in any event. Speech allows for constant change in our concepts and facilitates that 27. Vico, New Science, p. 138. In a passage of great importance to Mendelssohn, Vico defends his contention that scholars err if they regard the origin of letters as a question separate from the origin of languages by noting that "'character'. . means idea, form, model; and cer- tainly poetic characters came before those of articulate sounds," i.e., alphabetic characters. Scholars had failed to understand "how the first nations thought in poetic characters, spoke in fables, and wrote in hieroglyphs." 28. Mendelssohn, Jerusalem, p. 105. 29. Ibid., p. 102.</page><page sequence="9">MENDELSSOHN ON THE COMMANDMENTS 247 change. Both of these implications are present in the text, I believe. One begins to see just how indispensable Mendelssohn's abstract and problem- atic "deviation into byways" is to the defense of the commandments which he is about to propose. We approach that purpose in the third step of the argument. The progress from things to images to hieroglyphs to alphabet had obvious beneficial effects, Mendelssohn observes, but it also provoked misunder- standing and abuse, chiefly because signs were mistaken for what they were meant to signify. Animals once used to denote moral qualities such as cour- age came to be taken as embodiments of divine powers. Priests connived in this development, to be sure, but the main culprit was the human proclivity not to admit to ignorance about the ultimate causes of things. In any case, the world was soon dominated by superstition and idolatry. Mendelssohn can thus explain why idolaters overwhelmingly worshipped animals rather than men. He further confirms his suspicions on this score through a fasci- nating exegesis of Hindu mythology ("now read for yourselves in the Shasta of the Gentoos") in which he makes good symbolic sense of an apparently outrageous tale of monsters, tortoises, and elephants. He also conducts a marvelous thought experiment in which he imagines how the tribal chief brought back to England by Captain Cook might have misunderstood the worship of the congregation of deists in Dessau. Both exercises demonstrate "how easily such symbols and hieroglyphics could lead one into error," all the while exhibiting remarkable understanding and even tolerance of that error, which the rabbis of his day (and ours!) would have dismissed as sim- ple idolatry. We should "take care not to regard everything from one's own parochial point of view, lest one should call idolatry what, in reality, is per- haps only script."30 It is not my concern here to evaluate Mendelssohn's theory of language and alphabets, steeped as it is in Enlightenment speculation in which I am not expert. Suffice it to note that the sympathetic treatment of Hinduism and other putative idolatry probably marks a revolution in the history of Jewish thought, not unrelated to the change in the conception of command- ment now to follow. The leap from script to idolatry, which Altmann justi- fiably finds so unsubstantiated, prepared the ground for Mendelssohn's 30. Ibid., pp. 105-115. Quotation on p. 113. "Gentoos" and "shastas" were common eighteenth-century terminology for Hindus and their sacred writings.</page><page sequence="10">248 ARNOLD EISEN "surmise about the purpose of the ceremonial law." Namely: that while animals and images and even numbers could be mistaken for that which they symbolized, actions could not. God had therefore given the Jews sym- bolic actions which would "continually ... call attention to sound and un- adulterated ideas of God and his attributes."3' The claim is patently problematic. Actions can be "idolized" too, i.e., rendered the means or occasion for invoking or coercing divine spirits. As Mendelssohn well knew, they could also be reduced to rote habit devoid of any symbolic role whatever.32 The deeper problems with the theory, however, cannot be grasped without a digression of our own. For the tales of Omai of the South Seas and the "Shasta of the Gentoos" point us to the principal source of Mendelssohn's discussion-Maimonides' Guide for the Perplexed. This text also served as the principal object of attack in Spinoza's Tractatus, long recognized as a formative influence upon Jerusalem. Omai and the Gentoos are the historical embodiment of the Sabians made famous by Maimonides' Guide and of the rampant superstition attacked by Spinoza in the Tractatus-albeit idolaters rendered gentle and rather sympathetic in the wash of Mendelssohn's tolerance. If we wish to make sense of the cere- monial script, therefore, and particularly of these climactic pages in Men- delssohn's "digression," we need to follow Mendelssohn's complex borrow- ings and divergences from Maimonides and Spinoza. We need, in other words, to place him, to this extent at least, in the history of ta'amei ha- mitzvot.: the provision of reasons, or meanings, for the commandments. From Commandment to Ceremony to Script The position which Mendelssohn stakes out in Jerusalem follows directly from the twofold challenge posed to him by the Searcher. First, traditional Judaism had practiced and even demanded coercion in matters of religion, for example decreeing the death by stoning of all who violated the Sabbath. If Mendelssohn found such coercion unacceptable, he had stepped outside the religious framework of his ancestors. Second, the laws of Moses were mere "burdensome ceremonies." True "adorers of God" did not need and 31. Ibid., pp. 117-118. 32. Ibid., pp. 72-73, and see the final part of the present essay.</page><page sequence="11">MENDELSSOHN ON THE COMMANDMENTS 249 could not use them, for "the observance of divine commandments from fear of punishment attached to them is slavery, which ... can never be pleasing to God."33 Mendelssohn had to refute the former claim (accepted, we note, by both Maimonides and Spinoza) or find his reason in contradiction to his faith-a possibility so repugnant that he breaks off in mid-sentence when he comes to acknowledge it.34 However, if he succeeded in showing that Judaism could not coerce observance but only elicit it through persuasion, rebuttal of the Searcher's second charge became all the more imperative. Jews who stood convinced that the commandments were a burden and only that would surely cast them off when given a chance. Mendelssohn was arguing that they should have that chance, probably foreseeing that in fact they soon would have it. Ta'amei ha-mitzvot had thus become of unprece- dented importance. Unless there were sound reasons for observing the com- mandments, Jews were unlikely to maintain such observance voluntarily. Yet if the situation facing the Jews in Mendelssohn's day was unprece- dented, the second challenge posed by the Searcher was not. Jews had been responding for centuries to the charge that their commandments were mere burdensome ceremonies. Moreover, the particularly modern formulation of this challenge had been put forth a century before the Searcher-and with far more cogency-by Spinoza. If God could no longer be conceived in per- sonal, let alone anthropomorphic terms, and revelation came only through reason, "divine law" could refer only to that which "regards the highest good, in other words, the true knowledge of God and love." God could not be a lawgiver in the traditional sense. Commandments were therefore "divine" not by virtue of their source but by virtue of their object. "He alone lives by the Divine law who loves God not from fear of punishment, or from love of any other object .. . but solely because he has knowledge of God, or is convinced that the knowledge and love of God is the highest good." The "means demanded by this aim" might be called the "commands of God," but not "the performance of ceremonies-that is, actions in themselves indifferent ... or actions symbolizing something profitable for salvation ... [or] actions of which the meaning surpasses human understanding." These things, instituted as "symbols of something good, are mere shadows which cannot be reckoned among actions that are the offspring, as it were, or fruit 33. Ibid., pp. 84-87. 34. Ibid., p. 85.</page><page sequence="12">250 ARNOLD EISEN of a sound mind and of intellect. There is no need for me to go into this in more detail."35 Mendelssohn did have such a need, of course. Hence Jerusalem, and par- ticularly the extended discussion of mitzvot with its digression about alpha- bets and Hindus. Mendelssohn could have omitted the entire discussion if his only concern had been the Searcher's first challenge: the legitimacy of ecclesiastical coercion. Immediately after the discussion of mitzvot, he rebuts that challenge with the Spinozist notion that Jewish law had original- ly been political, the constitution of a state-and every state legitimately employed coercion. The Sabbath-breaker was stoned because he offended against the state as much as against God. The two were at that point indivi- sible. Mendelssohn only adds, as against contemporary proponents of ecclesiastical coercion, that the Mosaic constitution was unique. Its model no longer applied. As against the Searcher, he argues that Judaism since the Jewish state's destruction had known of no penalty other than the sinner's remorse.36 The latter claim is of course highly dubious. As Altmann writes, it "does not fully correspond to the facts.""37 Our concern, however-and, I believe, Mendelssohn's-lies elsewhere. The point of Jerusalem's second part is to refute Spinoza's argument (soon to be repeated by Kant)38 that the law was not only irrelevant to true faith but a hindrance. "The natural light of reason," wrote Spinoza, "does not demand anything which it is itself unable to supply, but only such as it can very clearly show to be good, or a means to our blessedness."39 Men- delssohn has to show that even if reason did not actually demand the Jewish means to divine instruction-God had given the commandments only to Israel, and would not deny the rest of humanity a necessary instrument of salvation-nonetheless the ceremonies were "clearly ... good," a "means to 35.

Not surprisingly, he turns for guidance in this exercise to the supreme rationalist of Jewish tradition, Maimonides, who had devoted a large section of his masterwork to the rational explication of the command- ments-and had become, for his pains, both the principal villain of Spinoza's treatise and the subject of enormous rabbinic controversy. The "digression" of Jerusalem thus leads directly to one of the most important and long-lasting currents in the history of Jewish thought-and Jewish polemic. We might usefully begin with Maimonides' own defense of the punish- ment meted out to the Sabbath-breaker. Observance of the day of rest was intended to further "the belief in a true opinion-namely, the creation of the world in time," as well as to instill "the memory of the benefit God bestowed upon us by giving us rest 'from under the burdens of the Egyptians.'" Hence its establishment so firmly that violation incurred the penalty of death. "You know from what I have said that opinions do not last unless they are accompanied by actions that strengthen them, make them generally known, and perpetuate them among the multitude."40 Maimonides proceeds to elaborate three purposes for the command- ments: the furtherance of "correct opinion" about God (termed the "wel- fare of the soul"); the abolition of wrongdoing in society; and "the acquisi- tion by every human individual of moral qualities that are useful for life in society" (the last two purposes comprising "the welfare of the body"). A precious few individuals could learn correct divine opinion in detail. For the majority, it was enough to know of God's existence and oneness, to love and fear the Lord. To this knowledge the mitzvot were meant to guide us. All the commandments, Maimonides insists, could be comprehended in this fashion, at least in principle, even those which had proven recalcitrant to centuries of attempted explanation.41 The .ukkim too, as Twersky puts it, were "messages which must be deciphered and decoded."42 The principal method adopted for explaining the least decipherable com- mandments, particularly sacrificial worship, was historicist: God wished to 40.

Sacrifices were a bow to the influence of the "Sabians," in the attempt to extirpate them and their ways. Other prohibitions also could be explained as accommodations to or interdictions of the ways of an idolatrous world. In this manner it came about that "the memory of idolatry was effaced"-so much so that the means to that effacement at times seemed pointless-and "the grandest and true foundation of our belief-namely, the existence and oneness of the deity-was firmly established."43 The extent of Mendelssohn's borrowing should be apparent. Like Mai- monides, he presents the commandments as an ingenious pedagogy intend- ed to accomplish, through indirection, what could not be achieved in any other way. Like Maimonides, he devotes a substantial portion of his argu- ment to a digression concerning the "Sabians," even dwelling, as Mai- monides did, upon Hindus in particular, by way of explanation for God's recourse to the commandments. His account combines the same two ele- ments: historical and intellectual-moral. Like Maimonides, finally, he draws a distinction between the knowledge of God accessible to all human beings and the higher degree of knowledge available to only a few, thereby finding a variegated role for the commandments amid the broad access to God afforded by reason. But there the borrowing ends. In fact, if we look more carefully, we find that in each case Mendelssohn is forced to veer away from Maimonides in a crucial respect that seriously undermines the co- herence of his own theory. Take, for example, Mendelssohn's climactic statement of the rationale for the mitzvot-built, like Maimonides' explanation, upon a text from the early chapters of Deuteronomy. "In everything a youth saw being done, in all public as well as private dealings, on all gates and on all doorposts, in whatever he turned his eyes or ears to, he found occasion for inquiring and reflecting, occasion ... to seek the instruction which his master considered him capable of absorbing and prepared to receive."44 Maimonides could hardly quibble with this. The passage that Mendelssohn exposits directly 43. Maimonides, Guide, pp. 518, 527 (bk. 3, chaps. 29, 32). On the notion of accommoda- tion, see Twersky, Code, pp. 389-391, and Amos Funkenstein, Theology and the Scientific Imagination from the Middle Ages to the Seventeenth Century (Princeton, 1986), chap. 4. 44.

Oral law applies eternal divine decrees to changing human circum- stances. But Mendelssohn's intent here, I believe, is far from traditional. To fathom it we must recall his warning that doctrines and convictions cannot be committed to words or script, "into which we cannot force our concepts without disfiguring them." Maimonides was, of course, far from such skepticism. For him the mitzvot served as symbols or reminders of truths which he could and did state propositionally. He was so certain of his formulations that he codified them and demanded assent under penalty of law. God had, after all, revealed those truths, through Moses the prophet, at Sinai. For Mendelssohn "much confusion and indistinctness are bound to remain in the signification of words."47 God could not and did not reveal truths in words, at Sinai or anywhere else. The subject of prophecy, signifi- cantly, does not arise in Jerusalem. We learn eternal truths through reason's immediate apperceptions and the rational work leading to and from those moments of "revelation." Hence the need for a divine pedagogy even more indirect than the one which Maimonides had imagined. Not only did students differ in their capa- city to appropriate meaning from the commandments. More important, that meaning itself would necessarily differ from time to time, place to place, and person to person. The ceremonies did not, as Maimonides would have 45. Mendelssohn, Jerusalem, p. 119. 46. Ibid., p. 102. Heinemann does not parse the explanation of the mitzvot in part 2 of Jeru- salem in light of the skepticism concerning language evinced there and even more so in part 1, with the result that Mendelssohn emerges from his reading as a thoroughly traditional figure urging us to seek out the meaning of observance in order to fill it with proper intention. The text, I believe, is far more nuanced, and its import more radical even than Mendelssohn himself may have realized. One certainly cannot say, with Heinemann (Ta'amei ha-Mitzvot, p. 22) that Mendelssohn "believed in the Oral Law with perfect faith, and as we have mentioned, con- sidered this faith among the fundamental principles of Judaism." The entire thrust of Mendels- sohn's essay is to make such a statement about belief in doctrine and fundamental principles virtually meaningless. 47. Mendelssohn, Jerusalem, p. 66.</page><page sequence="16">254 ARNOLD EISEN it, take us to truth so much as provide an occasion for its coming within range of our intuitive grasp. That being the case, there could not be one single meaning to a commandment, let alone one single correct meaning. The meaning lay in what those who practiced it grasped, with the help of their communities and teachers, from the set of behaviors mandated by the Torah.48 These meanings would presumably fall within a certain range defined (and limited) by the very few principles Maimonides had put for- ward as essential for all to know: God's existence, unity, and power. God had, after all, ordained this set of behaviors with the intention of stimulating this process of arriving at this set of meanings, and the process had "worked" with a fair degree of success for centuries. The relative constancy of the framework would thus keep the various truths variously arrived at within a common and enduring boundary. But in no way could a particular commandment be said to lead to a particular truth or have only a single meaning attributed to it. Pluralist to the core, Mendelssohn endorsed a rather radical version of the rabbinic dictum, "these and these are the words of the living God."49 The framework itself would shift as oral tradition modified the observance of the commandments, and the meaning of the principles grasped with the help of those ceremonies would also be open to discussion rather than a fit subject for oaths or credos. Hence Mendels- sohn's failure to call his script "symbolic," a word which for him connoted precisely the sense of propositional utterance which the mitzvot did not make. Maimonides' attempt to codify belief was in his view a grave error. Second, while Mendelssohn certainly shared Maimonides' conviction that students varied as to their capacity, so that the same words of the Torah would be grasped differently by students of differing ability and the same commandments would give rise to differing levels of understanding, Men- delssohn leveled the difference between masses and elite. The knowledge of each person, being the gift of a gracious God, was entirely adequate to his or her salvation and felicity. This leveling was made possible by Mendelssohn's apparent conviction that even the greatest of minds cannot know all that much about God. He forever counseled humility in this regard, and there- fore tolerance. If there is little that we can or need to know, that little can in 48. Heinemann claims (but fails to demonstrate) that Mendelssohn relies here on the edu- cational theory articulated by Rousseau in Emile. See Heinemann, Ta'amei ha-Mitzvot, pp. 29, 43. 49. Mendelssohn himself quotes the dictum in Jerusalem, p. 101.</page><page sequence="17">MENDELSSOHN ON THE COMMANDMENTS 255 principle be grasped by almost everyone, and errors of apprehension should be corrected but forgiven. Mendelssohn read Psalm 19, the key proof-text for this section of the argument, to say that the instruction of the heavens comes with "no teaching, no words, without their voice being heard." The elite could not achieve certain knowledge of what the heavens teach, for apprehension of ultimate reality always comes through intuitions beyond language. The diffusion of this nonverbal instruction was "as universal as the beneficent influence of the sun."50 It reached, therefore, even to idolaters. The point of Maimonides' digres- sion into the ways of the Sabians is to account for God's recourse to the commandments: a simple opposition of error to truth, evil to good, in keep- ing with rabbinic tradition. For Mendelssohn the situation is far more complex.5' On the one hand, he too needs to invoke idolatry-and relate it tenuously to the development of language-in order to account for the com- mandments. The divine legislation makes sense only given the history of mankind which Mendelssohn constructs. On the other hand, Mendelssohn believes that God's grace extends from one end of the earth to the other. His two examples of idolaters-Omai at the Dessau temple and the Hindu scriptures-are brought to show how often we misunderstand idolatry, con- fusing its symbols with the message to which they are meant to point. That message, Mendelssohn argues, is not only acceptable to Jews and other rational believers, but noble. When we attack other religions as pagan, the fault perhaps lies with us. We have misunderstood them.52 However noble this argument, Mendelssohn's case is painfully weak. It is one thing to say that a language composed of images could lead to wor- ship of animals-if the images were those of animals, and if these images were used to represent moral qualities that over time became transmuted into divinities. It is another thing to say that most images or hieroglyphs would have that result-let alone that a language of written characters would do so. Canaan, Greece, and Rome-the idolatrous cultures of most 50. Ibid., p. 126.

Mendelssohn tries to rescue his case with the sudden claim that "we have seen how ... our alphabetical script makes man too speculative." We have, of course, seen nothing of the sort-and anyway speculation is not idolatry. What is more, Mendelssohn cannot invoke the unique Mosaic constitution in order to explain the origin- al force of the commandments in a world given over to idolatry, and then argue that in the absence of this constitution (and of idolatry!) the mitzvot are no less relevant, their purpose having been all along to lead us to eternal truths. He cannot-on the face of it, at least-have it both ways. The Guide, in sum, holds the key to Mendelssohn's reply to the Searcher, but at every turn the doors which Maimonides opens are not doors through which Mendelssohn can walk. Mendelssohn's skepticism about the reliabil- ity of language undermines the notion of commandments as pointers to truth. His democratic conviction that access to God is universal clashes head-on with Maimonides' elitism. This same conviction, finally, neutra- lizes his own antipathy to idolatry and calls into question any explanation of the commandments as devices to uproot it. True, Maimonides believed that God's strategy to rid the world of idolatry had been largely successful by his own day; Mendelssohn might well have reasoned that in the intervening cen- turies the process must have reached its conclusion. Even so, however, the gap between his own view and that of Maimonides is too great to be bridged. Confronted by a real-life pagan, Mendelssohn would no doubt have invited him or her to tea and conversation so as to uncover the rational truth behind the pagan's odd symbolic expression. Maimonides would have meted out a different fate-in keeping with a system of thought far more internally consistent than the one evinced in Jerusalem. Consistency could not be Mendelssohn's strong point, nor Maimonides his sole model, as he strove to mark out a new path to observance lying somewhere between Maimonides' certainty and Spinoza's apostasy. We have seen the difficulties attendant on that effort. It is time to give an account of its achievement. Ceremonial Script as "Plausibility Structure" The heart of that achievement lay in Mendelssohn's wrestle with the emergent modern context for halakhic observance: voluntarist, individual, 53. Mendelssohn, Jerusalem, p. 118.</page><page sequence="19">MENDELSSOHN ON THE COMMANDMENTS 257 and thus dependent to a large degree upon rational argument, rather than communally coerced in a culture dominated by traditional authority. Men- delssohn realized, I believe, that the very preconditions which made this new sort of observance possible and necessary also worked counter to the effort of persuasion in which he was engaged. How could people be brought to surrender autonomy once it had been gained? (This is, of course, the ques- tion at issue in part I of Jerusalem, answered there with a very democratic notion of the social contract.) Equally important, why would Jews under- take a regimen that relied on spoken words, personal example, and indirect pedagogy as they moved to enter a culture that was increasingly impersonal and bureaucratic, transmitting knowledge through the more efficient (and so rational) means of the printed word? Hence the enormous lengths to which Mendelssohn goes in his effort at persuasion, involving nothing less than a theory and history of language. Hence too the principal flaw of that theory, taken on its own terms: how would a variety of ceremonies, mediat- ed by a still greater variety of interpretations-the latter changing from time to time, place to place, and even person to person-yield eternal truths that are "legible and comprehensible at all times and places"?54 In other words, could the community and authority which Mendelssohn intended to safe- guard survive the voluntarism and personalism which he introduced into observance? Rotenstreich, puzzling over this gap between the small set of truths at which all aim and the variety of means used to achieve them, speculates that Mendelssohn must have believed that our highest ideas are essentially inde- pendent of the societies and cultures which we inhabit.55 Eternal truths are, after all, independent of language, and language is a sociocultural product. To a degree, I think, he is correct. Mendelssohn did hold that all people, regardless of language, irrespective of symbols, have access to the one God who created them all. But this only begs the question. The contradiction is fully exposed when, in the passage quoted above, Mendelssohn contrasts "words and script" understandable only at one point in time and space with "things and concepts inscribed in the soul"-this after a long discussion of language in which he finds "concepts" and "words" well-nigh inseparable! What good does it do to limit the range of possible meanings for the mitzvot 54. Ibid., p. 126. 55. Rotenstreich, "Mendelssohn and the Political Idea," p. 246.</page><page sequence="20">258 ARNOLD EISEN with sentences like "the Lord our God is One" when the meaning of all such words is opaque, and will vary from one speaker to another? The problem is irresolvable; Mendelssohn may or may not have realized this, and accepted the danger as a price he was prepared to pay for a more voluntarist and rationalist mode of observance. I would argue, however, that in return for this risk (and the inconsistencies noted earlier) he gained a great deal indeed. Precisely because the mitzvot could not be defined in propositional terms, their performance made possible a sort of Jewish meaning not previously available. Note, first, that Mendelssohn urges each Jew to endow the acts required of all Jews with highly personal significance. The character of observance is thereby transformed. One is not doing X in order to signify Y, X being the same for all individuals in all centuries, Y being a truth available to philo- sophers (and some non-Jewish believers) by other means. Rather, X in the ideal case is inseparable from the signification which each person or com- munity attaches to it. The act comes laden with meaning. Each of us must enact our own relation to the tradition, and such enactment, Mendelssohn reasons, should generate ever-fresh commitment. The problem with alphabetical script is that it displays knowledge "too openly on the surface; it spares us the effort of penetrating and searching, and creates too wide a division between doctrine and life."56 Ceremonial script by contrast should vitalize observance by forcing the individual to share in the creation of its significance, all the more so if that significance changes from time to time as one proceeds through life along the path which the commandments mark out. This variance will be over and above the subtle changes introduced almost imperceptibly by any developing oral tradition. Mendelssohn can thus define Judaism in terms of revealed legislation and not revealed truth without detracting (in his own mind) from the impor- tance of the religion. The legislation is, after all, God-given rather than arbitrary, eternal rather than transitory-precisely like the eternal truths revealed to reason. The medium of Torah is, as it were, its message. The mitzvot, again, are not symbols for something else but a veritable language in themselves, a way of conversation with God and human fellows.57 56. Mendelssohn, Jerusalem, p. 118. 57. Morgan points out that to Mendelssohn the mitzvot were not symbolic of particular truths but associated with them in our minds, as a checkered deerstalker hat and magnifying glass are associated with the character Sherlock Holmes. Yes and no: the latter association is far less equivocal than any Mendelssohn would recognize between mitzvah A and truth B. See Morgan, "History and Modern Jewish Thought," p. 477.</page><page sequence="21">MENDELSSOHN ON THE COMMANDMENTS 259 Mendelssohn has shifted the weight in religion from one sort of language to another, from thought to practice. Torah is not wisdom but the way one walks in order to acquire it.58 Such a theory, third, well suited Mendelssohn's aim of persuading Jews, in the absence of coercion, to undertake the regimen initiated at Sinai. The point, already alluded to above, bears expansion. Mendelssohn, like Mai- monides, believed Jews obligated by the Sinaitic covenant. Unlike Mai- monides, however, he could not expect Jews to take on the burden of obser- vance in the context of integral communities endowed with the ability to coerce observance if it was not otherwise forthcoming. Hence the decidedly individualist thrust of Mendelssohn's rationale for the commandments, as opposed to Maimonides' emphasis on the welfare of both "soul" and "body"-the latter signifying societal welfare. "Collective felicity" is men- tioned in Jerusalem only in two parenthetical references. In one of them Mendelssohn calls its attainment, along with "personal felicity," the "direct" and "ultimate" purpose of the commandments. He then adds that the mitzvot "are also, in large part, to be regarded as a kind of script."59 This is astonishing: the explanation to which Mendelssohn had devoted his long digression is now made secondary ("also, in large part"), while the end to which the script is said to be the means-truth; i.e., "welfare of the soul"-is now joined to another end--"collective felicity"-virtually for the first time. The reason for Mendelssohn's emphasis on the individual at every other point in the essay, I believe, lies in the very premise of Jerusalem; public Jewish space and time were shrinking. In the modern sociopolitical order which Mendelssohn knew was emerging, Jews would have to rely less and less on public Jewish gates and doorposts in which to transmit their univer- sal and historical truths. The public space in which they walked would henceforth be German, or English, or French-witness part I of Jerusalem. In a situation of voluntary observance, the meaning attached to observance would have to be highly personal. This of course raises the question of what would hold the religious com- munity together in such circumstances. Here too, if I am correct, Mendels- sohn was quite prescient, anticipating the position of figures in the "his- 58. Heinemann makes this point well in Ta'amei ha-Mitzvot, p. 17. I believe I do not impute too much prescience to Mendelssohn when I attribute to him the awareness that the meanings of mitzvot would become highly individualized in the emergent modern era, and observance itself far less standard. 59. Mendelssohn, Jerusalem, pp. 119, 128.</page><page sequence="22">260 ARNOLD EISEN torical school" such as Zechariah Frankel and Solomon Schechter. He argued, in effect, that even in the past Jews had not agreed on either the meaning of the commandments or the precise definition of eternal truth, and properly so. The rabbis had been unwilling to allow codifications of mean- ing and truth such as the one proposed by Maimonides. The lack of unifor- mity would increase in the future. No matter, however: what united a com- munity was not uniformity in belief but commonality in practice. If Jews shared a ritual calendar and a set of sacred texts, if they were bound by the same dietary restrictions and collectively remembered the same historical truths, they would survive as a community despite the (inevitable) absence of shared propositional beliefs. Eternal truth would be present among them to the degree that their ceremonies stimulated its apperception. Pace Spino- za, one could not conceive a rational faith in the absence of such ceremonies. Indeed, they were essential to the achievement of that faith-witness Spino- za's own insistence that the sovereign coerce observance of whatever cere- monies were deemed necessary to the maintenance of the civil religion;60 witness, too, Spinoza's testimony to the role of circumcision in sustaining the Jews, "so important that I could persuade myself that it alone would preserve the nation for ever."69 Lest one think this reading of Mendelssohn an anachronism conceived in the image of Mordecai Kaplan, recall Mendelssohn's letter to his friend and disciple Herz Homburg, written soon after the publication of Jerusalem. The mitzvot may have lost much of their usefulness as pointers to truth, he con- cedes, but they are still needed in order to unify "true theists" in their con- tinuing battle against "polytheism, anthropomorphism, and ecclesiastical authority."62 Here, in private, Mendelssohn is far less sanguine about the universal diffusion of true religion. The "true theists" are of course the Jews, and they are a distinct minority. Commandments are necessary if the minor- ity is to carry on its age-old mission. What else could unite them? Surely not beliefs! The Jews, like any people, needed a common behavioral language, all the more so when the language which they spoke no longer distinguished them from their neighbors. The importance of the commandments, in a word, was sociological. 60. Spinoza, Treatise, pp. 245-256. 61. Ibid., p. 56. 62. Mendelssohn, Gesammelte Schriften, vol. 13, pp. 132-134.

First, Mendelssohn is advocating halakhic reform, and not always obliquely. Preserve the mitz- vot, he pleads, by reopening them to the changes which inevitably accom- pany an oral tradition. Like most reformers, Mendelssohn claims not to innovate. He hopes, rather, to return Jews to the original intent of their law, which according to tradition was written down only with regret and under duress. And, like many who hope to attract the wayward home, Mendels- sohn holds out a vision explicitly at odds with the reality which they had rejected. The elegiac tone of Jerusalem, the recurrent appeal to an ideal left unrealized, serve to underline Mendelssohn's dissatisfaction with the regi- men of mitzvah then in place. He could not abrogate the law-only God could do that, at a second Sinai-but he could and did contrast the original intent of the law with its present condition. This in turn could not be done, given the polemical context in which Mendelssohn wrote, without sharpening his criticism of Christianity.63 Attentive readers cannot fail to observe the difference between Judaism, with its living script and personalist meaning, and Christianity, with its "doctrinal opinions" and "saving truths." Nor could they fail to see the irony barely concealed in Mendelsson's protest that "I at least have nothing new to advance against the faith of the Christians."64 In this regard there was no need for novelty. The facts spoke clearly enough. The searcher for rational religion would choose neither Christianity nor Samaria, but Jeru- salem. Here, at the end of the essay's tortuous path, it is well to summarize the account of the commandments which Mendelssohn has provided. 1. God acted at Sinai to redeem a world sunk into idolatry by granting one nation, the Jews, a kind of script not easily mistaken for that which it signified. It would consist of actions rather than of images or words. 2. The performance of the ceremonial script, in the commonwealth over which God was sovereign, had the force of law. Everything a youth saw or heard would lead to correct apprehension of eternal and historical truth. Reality, in contemporary idiom, would serve as a supremely effective 63. Compare Heinemann, Ta'amei ha-Mitzvot, pp. 42-43, who notes that the critique applied particularly to Protestantism, which had devalued "ceremonies" relative to the Catho- lic Church. 64. Mendelssohn, Jerusalem, pp. 88-89.</page><page sequence="24">262 ARNOLD EISEN "plausibility structure" designed by God for the achievement of ultimate felicity.65 3. The ideal never came to realization, however. Immediately after Sinai, the Israelites built their golden calf. God turned even that crime to a lesson in love and fear of Him, but in the course of time the Israelites strayed still farther. From the time of Samuel God had to share authority in their commonwealth with an earthly sovereign. Then, when all else failed, He destroyed the commonwealth altogether and sent the Jews into exile.66 4. This left them with "ceremonies" rather than the original admixture of civil, criminal, and "ritual" laws; it left the ceremonies, too, without any power of enforcement. The legislation was, however, still capable of fulfill- ing its original pedagogic purpose to the degree that it marked Jews' gates and doorposts, thereby defining a community set apart from all others. 5. The modern era promised to offer the conditions for a purer sort of diaspora observance, purer because the commandments would be under- taken entirely voluntarily, and because the environment had been freed of the blandishments of idolatry. The times, however, required that Jews be persuaded to observe the mitzvot and indeed had rendered such persuasion more difficult than ever before. Moreover, this purer backdrop to obser- vance presumed the success of Emancipation, which in turn depended upon the fashioning of a Judaism appropriate to the new order. Mendelssohn's Jerusalem is both theory and polemic. He needs to define a new sort of Judaism and to plead for it before Jews and Gentiles alike. Hence, perhaps, the twice-quoted refrain which concludes the treatise: "Love truth! Love peace!" (Zechariah 8:19).67 These are the words with which the shaliah tzi- bur, at the high point of the High Holy Day service, concludes his prayer that he be found worthy to represent his congregation.68 65. The phrase is of course Peter Berger's. See The Sacred Canopy (Garden City, 1969) and The Heretical Imperative (Garden City, 1980). 66. Mendelssohn, Jerusalem, pp. 120-122, 132-134. 67. Mendelssohn cites the verse on pp. 101 and 139 of Jerusalem. His disciple Naphtali Herz Wessely had issued his famous pamphlet Divrei Shalom va-Emet [Words of peace and truth] the year before, in 1782, the title based on Esther 9:30. 68. Like Heinemann and unlike Morgan I find great consistency among the three explana- tions which Mendelssohn provides for the commandments: historical (idolatry), intellectual- moral (the achievement of felicity), and sociological (the preservation of Jewish community). I am not convinced by Mendelssohn's putative history of language, nor am I satisfied- particularly given the lack of examples-that ceremonies actually lead one to truth. But that would be difficult to demonstrate in any event. One should note that except for the theory of</page><page sequence="25">MENDELSSOHN ON THE COMMANDMENTS 263 Mendelssohn's audience was quite different, of course, and for it he fashioned a vehicle well suited to his new theory of the commandments, a new form for Jewish thought-the essay. He used that form to illustrate the new sort of Jewish learning which he and his fellow Enlighteners sought to promote, one which (like Mendelssohn's Bible translation) puts traditional insights into a new idiom and introduces into traditional learning general knowledge such as the voyage of Captain Cook. If we take Mendelssohn seriously, we must wonder what lies behind the cantankerous and trans- parently facile argument that people no longer learn from people but only from books-this from the pen of a man who has written more words than anyone would care to read in a month, in the midst of an essay crafted with such care that it marks a turning point in the history of Jewish thought. The point, I believe, is this. If a Jew no longer had the ability to "follow his teacher, to watch him, to observe his actions," etc., and was left only with the wise man's books; if abstraction had supplanted experience-let the abstraction be the sort which pointed out the dangers in its own enterprise. Let the wise man's book demonstrate the need for experience. Mendels- sohn's essay in this sense runs parallel to Judah Halevi's use of a philosophi- cal form to argue against reliance upon the philosophical road to truth, as the substance of the essay parallels Halevi's emphasis in the Kuzari upon the life of commandment rather than "religion within the limits of reason alone." Mendelssohn offered a new sort of instruction, compatible with and furthered by the new reading of mitzvot that he sought to convey. It is hardly surprising that a conception so complicated failed to win adherents. Several of Mendelssohn's children and disciples understood him to say that since rational truth was universal, one set of symbolic obser- vances was as good as another. Why then be Jewish if Christianity was entirely adequate, and carried with it enormous practical benefits? Abraham Geiger and other reformers, invoking Mendelssohn at every turn, misread him to say that commandments, being symbols, were entirely instrumental to the achievement of a few eternal, propositional truths.69 Logically, then, the ceremonial script, Mendelssohn's account is highly traditional. On the history of ta'amei ha-mitzvot, see especially Ephraim Urbach, The Sages [Hebrew] (Jerusalem, 1975), pp. 320-347; and Heinemann, Ta'amei ha-Mitzvot, vol. 1. Mendelssohn's explanations for particu- lar commandments in his Be'ur are utterly traditional-at one point (Exod. 23:19) even coun- seling obedience to a law we cannot understand! See Heinemann, vol. 2, pp. 27-31. 69. For Geiger's views, see, most conveniently, Max Wiener, ed., Abraham Geiger and Liberal Judaism (Philadelphia, 1962), pp. 113-118, 170-172, 283-293.</page><page sequence="26">264 ARNOLD EISEN one should retain the mitzvot still capable of performing that function and discard the rest. Symbol was symbol, after all, while truth was truth. Men- delssohn, as we have seen, never understood the mitzvot as symbols in this sense. Nor did he favor essentialist definitions of Judaism in terms of a small number of "truths." Samson Raphael Hirsch, believing like Mendelssohn that the legislation which bound Jews was divine and therefore irrevocable, read Mendelssohn to say that the commandments could be explained as symbols-and went on to provide an elaborate detail-by-detail deciphering of the code. The more opaque the ritual, the more tendentious Hirsch's explanation-and Hirsch insisted that his was the only correct deciphering, contrary perushim notwithstanding.70 One wonders whether Mendelssohn would have been at all surprised by these developments. Who more than he knew the difficulty in making clear one's intent to contemporaries and posterity? Who better than he could write a text on the dangers of writing, or hammer home the fact that the meaning of words changes when they are heard in a different historical or personal context? And yet, in a larger sense, others have chosen to walk the tortuous path which Mendelssohn first laid out, in two senses. Hirsch and Geiger, Kroch- mal and Rosenzweig, Kaplan and Heschel, Rav Kook and Soloveitchik- have all worked their way through the problem of justifying the command- ments in a setting characterized by voluntarist observance and rationalist epistemology. They have done so by drawing, as Mendelssohn did, on tradi- tional texts in the genre of ta'amei ha-mitzvot, and by employing notions of symbol and symbolic action proposed by Gentile contemporaries, whether these be Kant, Hegel, Schelling, Durkheim, or Dewey. The effort continues. It would seem to bear out both Mendelssohn's conviction that meaning would need to be ever reinvented in the modern period, and his notion of how that reinvention should proceed. Mendelssohn, however, stood in a second tradition-the "secular" or philosophical investigation of ritual and religion-and here too his heirs in 70. See, for example, Hirsch's long and belabored explanation of the prohibition on seeth- ing a kid in its mother's milk. The Pentateuch, Translated and Explained by Samson Raphael Hirsch, vol. 2 (London, 1967), at Exodus 23:19. For his symbolic theory of the commandments, see especially Samson Raphael Hirsch, The Collected Writings, vol. 3, Jewish Symbolism (New York, 1984).</page><page sequence="27">MENDELSSOHN ON THE COMMANDMENTS 265 that tradition, now found in the disciplines of the social sciences, can be seen to walk the path which he discerned. I will briefly mention three lines of inquiry which seem to me particularly useful and particularly relevant to the reading of Jerusalem. Take, first, Mary Douglas's attempts in a series of works to show that Durkheim's essential insight about the source of human thought in social groups was correct. Whatever else one makes of Purity and Danger or relat- ed works, one can accept Douglas's claim that at least in part the meaning of pollution and purification rituals varies with the sort of body politic which those rituals, again at least in part, serve to symbolize. It follows that in an individualist setting religious rituals could have no such meaning. Indeed, Douglas writes that "we moderns operate in many different fields of sym- bolic action," our rituals generating "a lot of little sub-worlds, unrelated" one to another, rather than a "symbolically consistent universe."79 I take it that this is precisely the problem which Mendelssohn recognized. My sense of what I do when I do a particular ritual differs from the sense of my ances- tors, because the context of meaning in which it figures is not the only one in which I move, and is not necessarily shared by those who share my life. Victor Turner argues that ritual functions differently when it is regarded as work (or commandment) than it does when conceived as play. In the lat- ter case ritual is situated in a separate sphere of life marked off from work by the category "leisure" and by the spaces designated for leisure-time enjoyment. Ritual in our industrial societies has long lost the character of the obligatory, the taken-for-granted, and has moved to the status of the optional. This change is, of course, coincident with the move from commun- al to individual or at best subcommunal mentioned above.72 It seems to me intuitively correct to add that activity in the realm of leisure, of play, cannot without contradiction be regarded as essentially fixed or unchanging or obli- gatory. What then to do with mitzvah? Mendelssohn, we might say, sought to get around this problem by fixing the commandments but licensing each individual Jew to "play" with their meanings. His dilemma is well captured in the fact that he adopted the word 71. Mary Douglas, Purity and Danger (London, 1966), p. 62. 72.

Ceremony adorns; commandments obigate. The social scientific category of ritual is no less problematic, usually presuming (as in Turner) a kind of action that runs counter to routine. This too illustrates the problem which Mendelssohn faced. Persuasion, however eloquent, cannot compete with the powerful "plausibility structure" of the modern state, and commandment, however vitalized with meaning, is either routine, fixed, or it is not mitzvah. Much is always lost in translation, even if much is sometimes gained. In light of Douglas and Turner, finally, consider Clifford Geertz's obser- vation that whereas religious ritual once served to fuse ethos and world- view, the way we live in the world with the way we see the world, modern life is characterized by leaps back and forth between or among a variety of perspectives-religious, aesthetic, scientific, common sense.75 The pathos of Mendelssohn's Jerusalem to my mind lies above all else in the disparity between his idealized picture of the mitzvot and the reality to which he sought to adapt it. How poor were the resources of the ceremonies to shape Jewish consciousness, when compared with the secular learning and society into which Mendelssohn plunged with such enthusiasm! How firm the resolve required to adhere to the mitzvot even while immersed in Enlighten- ment debates over language! And how different the "truths" suggested by the mitzvot from those readily available elsewhere, if indeed those "truths" remained untouched by the now-Gentile gates and doorposts through which they too had to pass! We are back once again at the problem of "plau- sibility structure" that has bedeviled all of modern Jewish thought, and will likely do so for some time to come. Mendelssohn's student Isaac Euchel, eulogizing his teacher in a Life published in 1788, a mere two years after Mendelssohn's death, wrote that 73. Funkenstein notes that Thomas Aquinas divided divine law into moralia, caerimonialia, and judicialia and believed the second group to entail "the recognition that everything man has, he has from God as first and last principle." Funkenstein, Theology, p. 240. The rabbis would have approved of that sentiment, but could not have accepted the threefold division, or indeed the rendering of mitzvot as ceremonies. 74.

A soul longing to choose the upright path will walk in his footsteps."76 Mendelssohn, to the contrary, had known and taught that books are a perilous source of wisdom, that utterances are incomprehensible without context and commentary, and that footsteps (in the modern world, at least) are almost impossible to replicate. All the more reason, then, for an objective set of behaviors which can both shape collective life and occasion the fashioning of individual meanings. Jerusalem, rife with inconsistencies, undermined by the wild "surmise" on which its theory of commandment rests, resolutely refusing to provide or even suggest particular meanings for particular observances,77 does not come close to solving the problem which it identifies. But it does identify this problem to a remarkable degree, pointing to a path between Maimo- nides and Spinoza which others would soon expand with profit. Given what we should reasonably expect from a book, Mendelssohn would say, we could not reasonably demand any more of his. Wisdom, after all, is found not in books but in lives. Stanford University Stanford, Calif. 76. Quoted in Altmann, Mendelssohn, pp. 758-759. 77. This is, to my mind, a weak point in the theory. On the other hand, how could Mendels- sohn argue the variability of meanings to observances and then do anymore than suggest meanings that he personally had found compelling? Mendelssohn in fact does the latter in the Be'ur, quite traditionally. Here he offers only a theoretical "surmise" (p. 117), avoiding the danger that he will dissuade his readers from observance because his particular rationales are unconvincing. For Maimonides' awareness of this danger, and his choice to explicate particular mitzvot nonetheless, see Twersky, Code, p. 418.</page></plain_text>
