<plain_text><page sequence="1">Comments on a Review of Michel Launey's An Introduction to Classical Nahuatl of Michel Launey's Jonathan D. Amith Gettysburg College It may be unusual for a third party to comment on a book review. But Michael McCafferty's review of Michel Launey's An Introduction to Classical Nahuatl (2011), which recently appeared in Anthropological Linguistics (2012), is unfortunate in tone and highly problematic in content, doing a great disservice not only to the book in ques tion but also to readers who look to reviews to guide them and to Nahuatl scholarship in general. The comments below attempt to provide a more balanced picture. The 2011 work is the English translation of an introductory grammar of Classical Nahuatl written by Michel Launey in French and published in 1979, nine years before he completed his monumental 1,609-page thèse d'état on the language (1986) but well after he had obtained the equivalent of a U.S. doctoral degree and had been teaching Nahuatl for many years. The original French book, in fact, was apparently based upon Launey's teaching notes. These, in turn, drew on Launey's extensive readings in early grammars (Carochi, Olmos, Aldama y Guevara) and the Classical Nahuatl corpus (particularly the Florentine Codex) (Launey p.c. 2014). Launey's studies of Classical Nahuatl, therefore, began well before Andrews (1975) published his first grammar; hence, it is inappropriate for McCafferty to claim that "Launey drew on Introduction to Classical Nahuatl" (2012:407), minimizing Launey's profound study of colonial sources. A defective Spanish version of Launey's grammar was produced in 1992, but the work has never been available in English. Indeed, both the French and Spanish versions are hard to obtain, a factor that apparently entered into the decision to translate it into English. Translation of any work over thirty years old invariably requires a difficult decision by the author: should it simply be translated (though perhaps pointing out in a preface that the author's views may have changed and that some information might be outdated) or should it be revised so as to become, effectively, a new edition? The English version of Launey's grammar falls somewhere in between: the translator, Christopher MacKay, "adapted" it, as the title page indicates. But in most respects it is basically a translation of the 1979 French original. McCafferty, however, regrets that Launey and MacKay did not incorporate "the improved understanding of the language that Andrews brings to his second grammar (2003)." This is not the place to enter into a detailed discus sion of the 2003 revised edition of Andrews's Introduction to Classical Nahuatl (1975) but the second edition is highly idiosyncratic and unnecessarily complex in its analysis, at times bordering on the unintelligible. For example, Andrews makes extensive use of zero morphemes, in fact distinguishing two types, 0 and O. A proper name such as niTezcatl-ihpöca 'I am Fuming-Mirror' is parsed as #ni-0-(0-0-Tez-ca-tl-0 + 0+0-Ih-pö-ca-0-0-0)0-0#. A reviewer has complained about this very same point, asking whether such analyses "actually help the student rather than confusing an already complicated picture" (Wier 2005:998). No serious linguist or Nahuatl scholar, let alone someone as accomplished as Launey, needs to (or should) follow Andrews's style of morphological analysis. This is even more the case for Nahuatl syntax, an area of study in which Launey's analytic and didactic skills are to this day still unrivaled. 288</page><page sequence="2">2013 Discussion and Debate 289 Conveniently, not counting its two-paragraph introduction and its one-paragraph conclusion, McCafferty's review falls into fifteen paragraphs, each of which brings up a point that he sees as problematic. I deal with each in turn. Page references are to Launey (2011) except where otherwise noted. 1. McCafferty correctly notes an unfortunate typographical error on p. 35: nèhuântin is mistakenly written for the first person plural pronoun tèhuântin. His characterization of this error as "inexcusable" seems extreme, however, especially since the correct form appears in all other examples (e.g., p. 37). 2. Launey (p. 72) mentions that there are three monosyllabic and three disyllabic verbs of a category that Andrews has called "class D"; Andrews (2003:65) lists four of each. Launey based his comments on a direct statement in Carochi's colonial grammar (2001 [1645]:135). One of the two verbs that Andrews (2003) includes in class D and Launey does not, yauh 'to go', differs morphologically from class D and is best considered to be simply em irregular verb, as does Launey (2011:80 and passim). (Indeed, Andrews in his earlier work lists the same six verbs that Carochi did as "regular class D verbs" [1975:47], while apparently also considering yauh 'to go' to be an irreguleir class D verb [e.g., 1975:23].) The other "class D verb," the disyllabic nähua 'to embrace', occurs nowhere in Carochi's grammar and it is only sporadically attested in other sources, often only in compounds or derivation. Siméon [1977 [1885]:303L moreover, lists it with the inflection of a class A verb. In the municipality of Cuetzalan, Sierra Nororiental de Puebla, I have documented nahua, with a short vowel and Class D inflection, meaning 'to embrace' and nähuahteki, with a long vowel, which refers to a ritual action of placing ones hands on a deceased person or coffin first with the right hand more distant and then the left hand more distant from the one performing this salute. In any case, I am not sure I would expect either Launey or MacKay to keep up with the inventory of class D verbs and change the translation accordingly. 3. In regards to the inalienable possessive suffix -yö, McCafferty objects to Launey's statement (p. 99) that when the noun refers to something attached to an entity, "the noun has the suffix -yö added to it and must by definition be possessed." McCafferty claims that "[Launey's] explanation is backwards. The essential point is that the noun is possessed; this has the consequence that the noun necessarily takes the -yö suffix" (2012:407-8). I do not understand the objection: -yö and possession are distinct although combinable (e.g., -yö may be followed by the absolutive suffix -tl, in which case the noun is not possessed). Moreover, not all nouns with possessive prefixes require the use of -yd; in most cases possessed nouns take a suffix -uh hui (this occurs when the possessed noun is separate from the possessing entity) or a zero suffix (in some half dozen cases, such as mäitl 'hand' or 'arm' and nomäi 'my hand' or 'my arm'). Note that in central Guerrero Nahuatl -yö is frequently used when the possessor is inanimate and the possessed noun is part of the possessing entity: ï-côzcauh 'his/her necklace' in contrast to l-cözca-yö 'its (an object's) necklace (in this case a necklace painted onto the surface of an anthropomorphic ceramic). Basically, then, it is McCafferty who has it backwards: as Launey states, -yö motivates a possessive prefix but possessed nouns do not automatically take ("as a consequence," in McCafferty's words) -yö. McCafferty raises an unfounded objection and states a false grammatical rule. 4. McCafferty states, following Andrews, that both the possessive adjective suffix -yô and the noun-final element -yötl, which Launey takes to be the source of -yô, are derived from an archaic verb having the form * tlayoä. This is a deductive, not inductive or empirically motivated, statement apparently based on an assumption that affixes derive historically from independent words. Andrews seems to consider words of the form noun stem plus</page><page sequence="3">290 Anthropological Linguistics 55 no. 3 -yô or -yötl as "incorporation" (N + V) to the archaic transitive matrix verb *(tla)-yoä. To my knowledge, however, there is no substantive evidence, either in proto-Nahuatl or proto-Uto-Aztecan, that would support the claim that -yô and -yötl derive from a verb. Dakin (1982:71-72) considers them "derivational suffixes," at least at the historical depth that she has researched. An introductory textbook hardly needs to delve into unsubstantiated reconstructions that might date as far back as Proto-Uto-Aztecan. 5. McCafferty objects to Launey's interpretation of adjectival forms such as iztäc 'white' and claims that these forms are derived through loss of a verbalizing suffix: from iztatl 'salt' is derived iztaya 'to become white', of which the perfective iztayac becomes iztäc due to "the underlying deletion of -ya-, a common phenomenon in Nahuatl verb mor phology". McCafferty goes so far as to say that Launey's approach "reveals a basic lack of understanding of the morphology of the language" (2012:408). It appears that here McCafferty is again following Andrews. I am, however, unaware of any phonological or morphological process that would delete -ya in the circumstances claimed by McCafferty; it certainly is not common. It is also not clear how such deletion (haplology in the case of iztaya?) would explain xocöc 'soin-' (cf. xocotl 'plum', e.g., Spondias spp.) as derived from the perfective form (xocöyac) of xocöya 'to become sour/soured'. Moreover, if one considers sets of related forms such as iztatl 'salt', iztäc 'white', iztaya 'to become white', iztalia 'to whiten'; or xocotl 'plum', xocöc 'sour', xocöya 'to become sour', the verbal semantics appears to follow the adjectival sense, not that of the nominal root. While McCafferty is free to hold that the adjectival forms in -c are derived from the perfective verbal derivations in -ya through deletion of this -ya before the perfective marker -c, there is no comparative or historical evidence that would support this deri vation. I think that the best interpretation—certainly for teaching purposes—is that there are a series of stems (e.g., poyé- 'salty', tzopéli- 'sweet', yancui- 'new') that have an adjectival sense and take -c, -ya, and -lia in paradigmatic relationship to indicate an adjective, an intransitive verb, and a transitive verb. (Dakin [1982:89] takes a similar view.) Additionally, in some cases there is an associated noun (with a shortened final vowel) that represents a prototypical object with the quality expressed by the root (e.g., iztatl 'salt' and xocotl 'plum'). In sum, McCafferty's and Andrews's interpretation seems highly conjectural, irrelevant to teaching, and consequently misplaced as a criticism of Launey. 6. McCafferty objects to Launey's claim that -lö is derived from *-l-hua and calls this claim "pure fantasy" (2012:408). The dismissive reference to "fantasy" is uncalled for, given that such derivations have been assumed by other Nahuatl specialists. For example, Dakin gives the derivation "*#-li-wa: &gt; -li-wi / -lo-wa / -lo: / -lo 'pasivo/ impersonal'" (1992:81). 7. McCafferty objects that Launey considers ne- a prefix added to passive stems to form reflexive impersonals (e.g., in such forms as netlâlïlo 'people sit', from tlälia 'to place down' plus reflexive marking). Rather, McCafferty considers that in these cases "a verb actually becomes a patientive noun." It is strange that McCafferty considers netlâlïlo and similar forms derived from transitive verbs to be "patientive nouns"; these forms in -lö take the full range of tense-aspect-mood markers, the most salient diagnostic of a verb in Nahuatl, as in many other languages. 8. McCafferty criticizes Launey's analysis of causative derivations of reflexively marked verbs. Taking motlazötlä 'they love each other' as an example, Launey states "here, the underlying verb to which the causative ending is added is reflexive" (p. 194). McCafferty objects, stating that "-t/â is not a causative suffix" (2012:408). However, McCafferty has</page><page sequence="4">2013 Discussion and Debate 291 not read the text carefully. By "the causative ending," Launey was referring to the causative suffix -Itia, which he discusses immediately after the cited remark, and the "underlying verb" to which -Itia is added is the reflexive form motlazotlà. 9. McCafferty objects to Launey's distinction between "true" causatives (Launey's scare quotes) and semicausatives, claiming instead that both types of forms belong in the same "causative basket." Actually, the domain of causatives in Nahuatl, whose morphology and semantics are still in need of study, does show multiple types. There is a vast literature on causatives and the terminology is by no means standardized, though Haspelmath (1993) provides an excellent overview of inchoative-causative alternations. Essentially Launey separates off as semicausatives the transitive members of what would perhaps now be called equipollent alternations, pairs of intransitive and transitive verbs such as tlapäni 'to break' (intransitive) and tlapäna 'to break' (transitive). Typically, the intransitive verb has an inanimate subject and denotes a state or change of state while the transitive form has a single agent that brings about a change of state. Semicausatives contrast (in both their morphological form and their function) with causatives in Launey's specific sense, which are formed from what would now perhaps be called unergative verbs, e.g., from huetzca 'to laugh' is derived the causative huetzquïtia 'to make laugh, to provoke laugh ter in'. Causatives in this sense effectively involve two agents: a second agent causes, compels, forces, or induces someone (the agentive subject of the corresponding intran sitive) to carry out the verbal action. One might quibble about the terminology, but the essential point is that very clear formal and functional distinctions can be drawn within the broad domain of causative constructions in Nahuatl and that these interact with other aspects of verb typology, such as a distinction between unergative and unaccusa tive intransitives. Launey's drawing of such valid distinctions is in no way the "meander ing discussion" that "cordonjs] off [semicausatives] as alien life forms" that McCafferty inimitably asserts it to be. Launey was the first to investigate such matters in Nahuatl and more recently has contributed one of the most insightful treatments of Nahuatl causatives (2002). Canger (1980:132-45) is one of the few other Nahuatl scholars to have explored such topics. 10. McCafferty is correct that there is a minor error on p. 266—the morpheme -pô is mistakenly called a prefix when obviously it is a suffix. This error was introduced by the translator; neither "suffix" nor "prefix" appears in the 1979 French version. 11. McCafferty complains that Launey does not mention the fact that the suffixes -ti (intransitive, p. 298) and -tia (transitive, p. 301) are related. McCafferty states that the -a is a causativizing suffix and that "there are few verbs ending in -ti that do not take the causative suffix -a" (2012:408). However, the verbal derivations that Launey discusses on p. 301 do not represent the intransitive-transitive pairs marked by an alternation -ti/-tia. Rather, the verbs discussed here are those in which -tia has been added to a nominal stem to signify 'to equip, to furnish, to supply [obj.] with [noun stem]', e.g., from calli 'house' one derives caltia 'to house, to provide or build a house for'. None of these transitive verb forms have a corresponding intransitive ending in -ti. There is, of course, a derivational inchoative-causative alternation that transitivizes -It-final verbs, but this is done with -ti+lia, not -tia (tläcatl 'man' &gt; tlâcati 'to be bom' &gt; tläcatilia 'to engender'). Some causatives in -tia have no corresponding -ti form (mictia 'to kill' from miqui, not *micti) while others do have one (causative pahtia 'to cure', intransitive pahti 'to recover [from illness, wound]'). So, neither is the -tia on p. 301 part of a transitive alternation nor are most transitives or causatives in -tia matched by intransitives in -ti, as McCafferty claims.</page><page sequence="5">292 Anthropological Linguistics 55 no. 3 12. McCafferty suggests that Launey "appears to think that there is a single suffix -oa; this is simply wrong" (2012:408). Actually, Launey is right. The -oa that Launey and McCafferty refer to verbalizes nouns: from tlaxcalli 'tortilla' is formed tlaxcaloa 'to make tortillas'. In this case, -oa is added onto a nominal stem. The other ostensible case, namely the alternation seen in, for example, polihui 'to perish, disappear' and polo(hu)a 'to destroy, to lose', should probably not be analyzed as involving a suffix -oa. Rather, the o (and its alternant i) is part of the stem, and the suffix is -hua; thus, the forms can be analyzed as *polV+hui and 'polV+hua. (Dakin [1982:165] essentially treats such forms in this way.) I do not think, as McCafferty suggests, that Launey, who does indeed understand morphology, was either "fooled by homophony" or thinks that "one suffix -oa alternates functions in a Jekyll-and-Hyde-like fashion" (2012:408). 13- In regard to huècauhtica 'for a long time', McCafferty is again ill-informed in several ways. He claims that Launey shows a "surprising misunderstanding of the spelling -tica." It is, however, McCafferty who shows a surprising misunderstanding of the spelling by relating it to what he cites as the verb ca 'to be'. The verb, however, is cà, with a final glottal stop, not ca, and its compounded form (used as a sort of progressive aspectual marker with verbs) is -ticâ, as in nichôcaticâ 'I am crying'. This ending -ticâ is distinct from the instrumental ending -tica, which lacks a final glottal stop; it is the latter that is seen in huècauhtica. In fact, huècauhtica could never be interpreted as a verb. While there is indeed an intransitive verb huècâhua 'to linger, to be late', the correct form with the auxiliary would be huècâhuaticâ 'he is lingering', not the ungrammatical *huècâuhticâ. (There is also a transitive counterpart -huècâhua, but in this case an object prefix is required, giving tlahuècâuhticâ 'he is procrastinating [things]'.) 14- McCafferty claims that there are "important omissions" and mentions as one of them the fact that the benefactive suffix -lia is listed in the index but not the causative suffix -lia. Actually, the index gives the suffix -lia and one of the pages referenced is 299 where Launey states: "Verbs in -tilia function simply as causatives to those in -ti." To further clarify, -lia is a valency-increasing ending that has various functions. One is to form benefactive or malefactive verbs. Thus, cuâlia is 'to eat up ([obj.], e.g., cattle entering a cornfield) in detriment to (e.g., the cornfield's owner)' while quïxtilia has the sense of 'to remove ([obj.], e.g., a splinter from a finger) for or in benefit of (the person with the splinter)'. Valency-increasing -lia also transitivizes intransitive verbs in two ways. In the first, -lia is in paradigmatic relation with -ya in equipollent inchoative-transitive alternations, e.g., iztalia 'to whiten, make white' and iztaya 'to turn, become white' (cf. iztäc 'white'). In the second, -lia transitivizes dénommai intransitive verbs ending in -ti, e.g., tläcatilia 'to engender' from tlâcati 'to be born' (cf. tlâcatl 'man'). The semantics of these transitive verbs ending in -lia is quite different than those of the causatives of unergative verbs, the most common recipient of the causativizing -(l)tia ending. Recall that only these latter forms count as causatives in Launey's sense of the term. In forms such as iztalia 'to whiten' and tläcatilia 'to engender', the transitivization represents the effective transfer of a quality to a recipient rather than the compelling or inducing of a volitional or agentive subject as in huetzquitia. It does not seem unusual to me that for such cases of valency increase on an inchoative verb an "applicative" form (-lia) might be used. McCafferty is also surprised at Launey's failure to mention "the common possessive prefix tla- 'something's', as in tlanacayö 'something's flesh'" (2013:409). Launey, in fact, is the only scholar who seems to have noticed that the use of tla- as a possessive prefix is extremely restricted. He includes a description (his section 24.6) of its use with locatives, explicitly noting that those locatives that allow the possessive construction can take</page><page sequence="6">2013 Discussion and Debate 293 tla- as a possessive prefix" (p. 245). There is no omission, contrary to what McCafferty claims. In fact, Launey clarifies a restriction to the use of tla- not noted elsewhere. Other Nahuatl scholars suggest that tla- can be prefixed only to relational nouns (e.g., Andrews 1975:150 and lesson 42, 2003:107; Carochi 2001[l645]:27]; Sullivan 1988:25 and chap. 10). Launey points out, however, that not all relational nouns accept tla-; it occurs only with some relational nouns and only with those that have a locative sense. Finally, the form tlanacayö that McCafferty mentions as a supposed example of possessive tla- is, as far as I am aware, constructed by him and is ungrammatical: tla- does not occur as a possessive prefix with nominal stems. In the very few cases in which tla- occurs before a noun stem, the stem retains the absolutive suffix -tl(i) used with unpossessed nouns, e.g., tla-nelhua-tl (not *tla-nelhua-uh) 'root (of a plant)'. That is, the resultant noun does not look like a possessed form, but rather like a compound. 15. Finally, McCafferty again correctly points out minor typographical or editing errors. Thus, of the criticisms that McCafferty levels at Launey, the only fully accurate ones involve minor typographical and editorial errors (in 1,10, and 15). The remaining criti cisms are at best relatively minor and at worst suggest a basic misunderstanding of Nahuatl on McCafferty's part. Leaving such criticisms uncontested would be damaging to Nahuatl studies and to Launey's important and useful work. Notes Acknowledgments. Before sending this response to Anthropological Linguistics, I asked Una Canger, Karen Dakin, and Michael Swanton for their comments and thoughts on its appropriateness. They were all kind enough to respond and make several sug gestions (which I have incorporated). Later, Pamela Munro also read a version of this response and asked that her name be included in support. Significantly, they all had a similar reaction to McCafferty's review and requested that I mention that they have read both the original review and my response and support the latter in every way.
