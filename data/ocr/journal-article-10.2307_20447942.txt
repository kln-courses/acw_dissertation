<plain_text><page sequence="1">exhibition review Cameroon-Art and Kings Museum Rietberg, Zurich February 3-May 25, 2008 reviewed by Christine Stelzig Nowhere else in West Africa, is there a larger abundance of big carvings, masks etc. [than in the Cameroon Grass fields] (Von Luschan 1908, cited in Stelzig 2004:263) Those were the words with which Felix von Luschan, head of the African department of the Royal Museum of Ethnography in Berlin from 1885 to 1910, expressed his excitement when contemplating on the museum's collec tions from the Cameroon Grassfields at the beginning of the twentieth century. The exhibition "Cameroon-Art and Kings" at the Museum Rietberg in Zurich allowed the visitor to empathize with von Luschan's excitement (Fig. 1). With more than 15o art works from German, French, and Ameri can museums and private collections as well as two objects from the Palace Museum in Fumban (Cameroon), this exhibition was the most comprehensive presentation of art from the Cameroon Grassfields ever organized. In the new spectacular building of the Museum Rietberg, opened in 2007, Lorenz Homberger, curator of the African department, showed splendid examples of the richness of this important West African art region: anthropo morphic masks, huge drums, elaborate items of jewelry and dress, royal thrones and mag nificent sculptures. Some of the objects are monumental in size, made of wood, ivory, clay, and metal, and all project an impression of the former splendour of Grassfield's kingdoms. The Cameroon Grassfields are the home of numerous small and large kingdoms, founded during the past centuries. In the service of the kings, sculptors produced all kinds of objects in a variety of styles, underlining the impor tance of the king not only locally, but also regionally. Alliances between the kingdoms were sealed by the exchange of gifts; sculptors traveled to distant kingdoms, and the loot ing of objects during wars, such as thrones or masks, contributed to the spreading of art styles throughout the region. At the begin ning of the 198os, the complex situation of the Grassfields was one reason for developing new approaches in the research on African art, since the paradigm of "one tribe, one style," -- assumed until then, could no longer be main tained (Kolog and Homberger 2008:16-17). Instead of ethnically defined art areas, the Grassfields are divided into three different style regions, which were the basis of the the exhibition's organization. The first part was dedicated to the prestigious court art of the Bamum kingdom in the eastern part of the Grassfields. The kingdom emerged after war like expansions of the Bamum people in the seventeenth century. It soon became the larg est kingdom of the Grassfields, with the capi tal Fumban as the center of royal production and splendor. One of the exhibition highlights, a headcrest or tu mola (Fig. 2) from the Pal ace Museum in Fumban, reflects the warlike past of Bamum. The headcrest is only one of about 500 important treasures from what is literally a living museum, since its objects are in ritual use to this very day. For example, the tu mola is taken out of the museum when the king announces a new commander-in-chief (tu panka). The last time this happened was in December 2004, when the new tu panka, accompanied by soldiers, left the palace of Fumban and presented himself to the public, carrying the headcrest and thereby reminding the spectators of the glorious past of Bamum. The most important item on display from Bamum, maybe the most important item of the entire exhibition, was the mandu yenu, the famous throne of King Njoya (r. ca. 1886-1931; Fig. 3). One of nearly forty objects from the collection of the Ethnologisches Museum in Berlin and presented for the first time outside the Berlin museum, the mandu yenu reflects as no other object the mutable relationship between the Bamum people and the Germans, between colonized people and colonialists.' Much desired by various German ethno graphic museums, the mandu yenu finally was 1 Entrance to the exhibition "Cameroon Art and Kings" (below) 2 Headcrest (tu mola) Bamum, 19th century Wood, beads, textile, metal; H 87cm (341/4") Palace Museum Fumban ALL PHOTOS COURTESY OF MUSEUM RIETBERG, ZURICH 104 a81ican ar:S SPRING 2009</page><page sequence="2">given to the Berlin Museum as a gift of King Njoya to Emperor Wilhelm II in 1908-at the instigation of Felix von Luschan and with the help of the colonial officer Hans Glauning.2 The second part of the exhibit featured the Bamileke region in the western part of the Cameroon Grassfields, whose style is impres sive by virtue of its asymmetrically expres sive sculptures (Fig. 4). The term "Bamileke" is an artificial designation, created by German colonial administration and ethnologists to describe hundreds of small, culturally and his torically similar kingdoms. Some of the objects here have become icons of African art, such as the so-called Bangwa Queen from the Mus6e Dapper in Paris and a commemorative figure (lefem) from a private collection. Unique in their movement, the commemorative figures of these kingdoms express a vitality understood for a long time mostly by artists of classical modernity. This specific part of the exhibition would have deserved much more space. Indeed, the exhibits were spread over 1300 square meters, but the presentation was not always convincing: the masterpieces of the Bamileke region were pressed so tightly in a corner that a disproportion was created between the objects and the space needed for an unhindered view. The narrowness of this segment of the exhibi tion did not do justice to the striking dynam ics of the sculptures, even more so as they were already restricted by the showcases. Finally, the third part presented art from the Grassfields of the Northwest Province of Cameroon, manifested in an enormous variety of zoomorphic and anthropomorphic masks, but also in those famous royal sculptures of the Kom region, whose function is still sub ject to debate. A closer contact between the Kom people and the Germans started in 1902 when Kurt von Pavel, then commander of the Deutsche Schutztruppen, arrived in their kingdom. The male figure from the collection of the Museum of World Cultures in Frankfurt , 4 r A: (Germany) is possibly a representation of the great-grandfather of King Yu (r. 1865-1912), who submitted to the Germans in 1902 (Fig. 5). The elongated, angular form reflects the austere, symmetrical style of that region. All of the installations were well presented and their lighting contributed to the exhi bition's success. Platforms and walls in Le Corbusier's shining colors interrupted the anthracite background and allowed many objects to glow in the true meaning of the word. Partition walls, especially a wall created by freshly cut tree trunks suggesting a palace wall, created passages and lines of sight and thus provided ever-surprising perspectives on the objects. Unfortunately, the layout of the introductory area, located on either side of the staircase leading into the exhibition, was not particularly ingenious. Although it contained a current map of Cameroon and some historical photographs of the palaces, it was separated 3 King Ibrahim Mbombo Njoya, sitting on the mandu yenu, the throne of his grand father King Njoya, at the press conference at the Museum Rietberg in Zurich, May 31, 2008.

This was intensi fied by the enormous attraction of the mandu yenu as the centerpiece at the beginning of the show. Not surprisingly, visitors focused on this marvellous object rather than on the explana tory entrance section. Twelve relatively short texts accompanied the presentation of the objects and informed the visitor on topics such as symbols of power, the use of tobacco pipes and masks, or palace architecture. Three hand-drawn maps from 1885 and 1906 showed the main parts of the Grassfields before, during, and after the Ger man conquest, indicating the speed of the colonial expansion. But they also contribute to the exhibition's somewhat ahistorical char acter, which suggests that the "traditional art" of the Cameroon Grassfields came to an end around World War I or at best World War II. Even the most important information in this respect-that most of the objects came into German collections during the classical age of collecting ethnographic specimens (c. 1870 1920)-is not explicitly stated in the exhibition texts. That many cultural, political, and social traditions still are a part of the daily life of the peoples of the Grassfields today is only illus trated by some film sequences of masquerades (by Hans-Joachim KoloI3 and Christraud M. Geary) that are shown in an adjoining room and date from the last thirty years. Even if the exhibition catalogue, on public view in the entrance area, features some photographs from the mid-1970s to 2003/2004, the exhibi tion itself projects an impression of a quasi frozen time period between 1885 and 1914. Conceptualizing exhibitions of African art today is certainly a major task. This show has the merit of having assembled a great many masterpieces from a vast art-producing region, some of them barely known to the public due to being held in private collections. But I do wonder (and this is due in part to my own interest in the history of collecting and ethno graphic collections) whether this aesthetically stunning display would not have benefited with more attention payed to the biography of the objects and to the context of collecting. Ever since Arjun Appadurai's seminal work The Social Life of Things and Igor Kopytoff's article therein on "The Cultural Biography of Things" we can no longer ignore the change of meaning and use which objects face due to their being collected. African objects have not come into Western collections out of nowhere, and museums, even art museums, can work on dispelling this impression by dealing with historical aspects openly and therefore with respectful regard to African peoples past and present.3 The exhibition is accompanied by a cata logue of 255 pages (German and English), with contributions by Lorenz Homberger, Hans Joachim Kolof3, and Christraud M. Geary as well as Christine Seige and Nanina Guyer (Homberger 2008).
