<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SYMBOL OF THE BEAST. THE ANIMAL-STYLE ART OF EURASIA, by Dagny Carter. Pp. ix + 204, pls. 48. Ronald Press Co., New York, i957. $8.50. The works of Rostovtzeff and Borovka are long out of print, and offprints of Sir Ellis Minns' masterly short survey, The Art of the Northern Nomads (ProcBrit Ac 28 [1945]) are no longer available. A new book on the subject of Scythian art and its ramifications, there- fore, is certain to receive a sympathetic and keen atten- tion, especially if it is based on a personal acquaintance of the author with the most important monuments and takes into account the finds made in Russian territories during recent years. Mrs. Carter's book meets both these requirements. She began to take an interest in Nomadic art as early as 1927; she has travelled to China and Mongolia, has seen the Leningrad collection, and has herself built up a collection of no less than 300 pieces. And, she has covered Rossica of recent date. Except for the Introduction, a chapter on "Beast Symbolism," and one on "The End of Eurasia's Ani- mal-Style Art," the text is arranged under geographical headings which may be enumerated here to give the reader an adequate idea of the scope of this book: i. South Russia; 2. Ananino and Perm; 3. Minussinsk; 4. Altai; 5. Pazyryk; 6. Ordos; 7. Noin Ula; 8. Luristan and Ziwiyeh; 9. Caucasus; io. Europe (of the Migra- tions); ii. Vendel and Viking Styles. Added are an extensive and useful bibliography (pp. 173-91), an in- dex of plates, and an index. As for the ultimate origin of the Eurasian Animal Style, Mrs. Carter holds, as did J. G. Andersson, that we have to look to the Palaeolithic (pp. 30, 91) and "a hunting people who at first used animal bones for their artistic creations" (p. 29). Later on we find the state- ment that "the origin . . . belonged no doubt to a spe- cific people" while the Scyths and metal traders acted as "distributors" (p. 114). But they would have been late in doing so if "this peculiar ... style existed un- mistakably in the sixteenth century B.c.," as the author observes apropos of a gold plaque from one of the Mycenaean shaft-graves (p. 3If; pl. 6 C), or if Queen Shub-ad's lapis lazuli box had to be taken as a still earlier relevant example (p. 30; pl. 6 B). We are facing here a set of unreconciled premises. Neither the Ur specimen nor the Mycenaean plaque bear on the problem of the beginnings of the Eurasian Animal Style; the intricate design of animals locked in combat is foreign to the early Animal Style, and it is foreign also to Palaeolithic art. Rather, the motif of the animals in combat appears only in Sarmatian art, a phase deeply modified by Oriental traditions, and it is to these latter traditions that the examples from Ur and Mycenae can be linked. The importance of palaeolithic survivals may be questioned also in the case of European animal sculpture after La Tine (pp. i29- 32). For the end of the Animal Art of Northern Eurasia, the author provides a more dramatic explanation: ... its disappearance coincides with the appearance of new anthropomorphic religions" (p. i68), Buddhism and Christianity, although "it is impossible to state precisely how long Eurasia's animal-style art continued among Asia's shifting and historically elusive popula- tions" (p. 171). The contents of the various chapters differ in ac- cordance with the existing literature. As far as possible, the history of research done in each area is briefly out- lined and a careful description of the major monuments given. In the main, therefore, the book amounts to an objective and convenient summary. It does not fulfill all the expectations of an art historian; the treatment of the works of art under discussion remains quite vague and unspecific, and the excitement of a more personal approach and discovery is lacking. There is a surprisingly large number of misprints which I imagine are the printer's and publisher's rather than the author's: p. 22 "Tiesenhauser" read Tiesen- hausen; p. 59 "hypocamp" read hippocamp, "Golom- stock" read Golomshtok; p. 68 "Ammianus, Marcel- linus, and Pluvius Secundus" read Ammianus Marcel- linus and Plinius Secundus; p. 86 "Poliokoff" read Poliakoff, "Equus hemoneonus" read Equus hemionus, "bachrianus" read bactrianus, "bagen becki" read hagenbecki, "Ovis amman Mongiolica" read Ovis am- mon Mongolica; p. 87 "pseudois" read pseudovis; p. 91 "H. Kuhn" read H. Kiihn; p. 125 "Dechelette" read Dechelette; p. 126 "Huk" read Huc, "Ernest Herzfeld" read Ernst Herzfeld; p. 189, s. v. Kuftin, "Tblisi" read Tbilisi; p. 19o, s. v. Beninger, "alnaische" read ala- nische; and p. 191 "Le Cog" read Le Coq. The legend of pl. 12 (a) referring to a horse's forehead ornament carved of stag horn erroneously reads "Hornblend or- nament." Only two of the 48 plates (pls. 21, 22) show specimens of Mrs. Carter's own collection of Ordos bronzes. It would be gratifying to see this collection published as a whole or in part, a task for which the author with her familiarity with both Chinese and Steppe art is eminently qualified.
