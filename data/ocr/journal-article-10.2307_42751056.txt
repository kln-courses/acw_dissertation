Middleburgh Abstract 'And a new spirit I will put within you' salutes John Rayner's contribution to the Liberal liturgies of the United Kingdom over more than forty years. It explains his ethos as a liturgist and quotes from his writings about liturgy as well as some of his original prayers. This is a heartfelt tribute from a devoted disciple to a master liturgist. When Rabbi Israel Mattuck set out to prepare the liturgies that became the Liberal Jewish Prayer Book (LJPB) he did not perform an act of creation ex nihilo. Even Mattuck had giant' shoulders on which to stand, in his case those of Rabbi Dr David Einhorn whose Olat Tamid , published in Hebrew and German in New York in 1858 and in Hebrew and English in 1896, and Rabbi Dr Kaufmann Kohler, whose Union Prayer Book , published in 1895, were to influence American Reform Judaism for nearly a century. The influence of the Union Prayer Book , and of Olat Tamid , may be felt throughout the Liberal Jewish Prayer Book for anyone familiar with them, but Mattuck was far more than a mere adapter or reviser, and he set his own stamp on the liturgies in use, first at the Liberal Jewish Synagogue and later in Liberal synagogues across England, not least in his fearless appropriation of doctrinally acceptable material, regardless of its source. In the 1960s, the rabbis of the Rabbinic Conference of the Union of Liberal and Progressive Synagogues asked Rabbi Rayner and Rabbi Chaim Stern to commence work on a new daily, Shabbat and festival prayer book, a prayer book that was to break new ground and develop in areas that its predecessors had not touched. When it was published in 1967 Service of the Heart (SOH) was very much a child of its time, touched by optimism and hope, not least Rabbi Dr Charles H.

Middleburgh with regard to the State of Israel, seen as a balm to the barely healed wounds of the Shoah. John Rayner, supported by Chaim Stern, broke the taboo on using modern English, abandoning 'thee's, 'thou's, and 'art's and introducing, for the sake of variety, paraphrastic renditions of certain prayers rather than straight translations. Three short paragraphs of the introduction which bear the Rayner hallmark, though focused on translations from prayers specifically, nevertheless say much about his approach to liturgy overall: Our guiding principles have been that the language of prayer should be exalted, yet honest and direct, both intellectually and emotionally; and that a translation should be, as far as possible, a translation rather than a paraphrase. We have tried to make the English of this prayer book speak for the worshipper, as the Hebrew does for those at home in it. It is, we hope, neither artificial nor sensational, but simple, clear and faithful to the sense of the original. We have not attempted to be colloquial, but we have also sought to avoid being pompous; and we have rejected as unworthy of our serious purpose the ancestor-worship implicit in the deliberate retention of archaic language. Above all, we have felt that verbal insincerity is the mirror image of an inward hollowness. No translation can ever succeed wholly; and prayer, the quintessential expression of Jewish thought and feeling, is peculiarly hard to translate. We know that we have often fallen short; but we hope that, nevertheless, we have not altogether failed in our endeavour to make Israel's millennial heritage of prayer, so wonderfully bright in its original tongue, come alive for the English-speaking worshipper of today, so that, even in translation, it may give wings to his spirit. (Rayner et al 1967: xi) Of all the redoubtable contributions that John, zTz'l, made to Liberal prayer books, the outstanding one, for me, was his facility with language. As only someone whose childhood tongue was not English can achieve, John's English was impeccable; indeed I have never known anyone else to exceed John for his grasp of the language and its grammar, and his sense for its cadence and rhythm. This made him a non pareil when it came to translation and the creation of new prayers and meditations. In Service of the Heart , a few of the Hebrew prayers were not translated but carried a clearly notified interpretative paraphrase. I shall cite two, the first to Modim , the second an alternative to Avot : 'And God saw all that he had made and found it very good.' Lord of all life, we thank you for the numberless tokens of your goodness with which our life is crowded: for life itself and its endless variety, for all that sustains body and mind, for love and friendship, for the delights of European Judaism Volume 45 No. 1 Spring 2012 43</page><page sequence="3">The Contribution of Rabbi John Rayner to Liberal Prayer Books the senses, for our powers of spiritual growth, and for the excellence of Your Teaching, which deepens our life and enriches our days. Teach us, O Lord, to work for a just, compassionate and humane society where all may share Your gifts in the joy of freedom. (Ibid.: 151) The Lord of the universe is our God, even as he was the God of our fathers. Our own experience and the historic wisdom of our people unite to teach us of his redeeming love. An unbroken chain of tradition links us with the earliest teachers of our faith. May we be reverent in our study of their words, and find in them the inspiration to live in obedience to God's will. Let us learn to enrich the teaching of our heritage with the knowledge of our own time. So shall we, by our lives and our labours, bring nearer to its realisation the great hope inherited from our forefathers, for the redemption of all humanity, in a world transformed by liberty, justice and peace. (Ibid.: 44f) As well as his innate sense of what worked or didn't work liturgically, John had a great facility for expressing the right thought at the right moment in language that was succinct and clear. Turning to Gate of Repentance, the High Holy Day companion to Service of the Heart published in 1973, the silent meditation he wrote for the Viddui rabbah (the great confession), in the liturgy for Yom Kippur shacharit, is a text of genius. John told me shortly before he died that of everything he had written for his various prayer books it was the one of which he was most proud. Covering three pages, it is too long to quote in its entirety, so I shall restrict myself to the final paragraph: Help me then, O God; help me always, but especially now, on this sacred Day of Atonement; help me to banish from myself whatever is mean, ugly, callous, cruel, stubborn or otherwise unworthy of a being created in Your image. Purify me, revive me, uplift me. Fill me with noble resolves this day, and help me to hold onto them through all the days that lie ahead. Forgive my past; lead me into the future, resolved to be your servant. (Rayner 1973: 217-19) In addition to his eye and ear for verbal beauty and his mastery of English, John brought a fierce intellectual and scholarly integrity to his liturgical work: working with him on Siddur Lev Chadash , of which more anon, was not just a model of how to create a liturgy but also a regular liturgical masterclass. John would prepare page after page of material for the editorial committee, focusing on just one prayer, analysing it line by line with lists of variations that included everything from Seder RavAmram and Machzor Vitry up to the latest siddurim. Not for John the liturgical equivalent of pinning the tail to the donkey, everything was done with precision if for no other reasons than that any 'new' liturgy has to have its roots in the past, and those who create it need to know 44 European Judaism Volume 45 No. 1 Spring 2012</page><page sequence="4">Charles H. Middleburgh precisely the grounding for their work and be able to defend their choices on the basis of historical precedent or a creative interpretation of other texts. When he introduced Siddur Lev Chadas h to the Liberal movement in 1995, John neatly summed up the liturgical trajectory on which he had taken the movement since the publication of Service of the Heart : . . . Lev Chadash continues - and in a sense completes - the process we began with Avodat Ha-Lev (Service of the Heart), of reinstating as much as possible of the traditional Jewish liturgy in our movement. Then we carried the process as far as we felt we could, given our antecedents. This time around we have taken the view that we have a positive obligation not to deprive ourselves or future generations of any traditional prayer that has abiding value. Of course there are provisos. The ideas expressed must be intellectually acceptable; the manner of expression must be felicitous, and not too repetitious; and no one service must be excessively long. So there are constraints, and there will always be room for different opinions as to where precisely the line should be drawn between that which does, and that which does not, deserve to be perpetuated. But this time, I hope and believe, we have got the balance pretty well right. We have gone about as far towards traditionalism as it is possible to go while remaining unequivocally liberal. We have omitted little, if anything, that the conservatives among us could legitimately wish to have included, and we have included little, if anything, that the radicals among us could legitimately wish to have omitted. (Introducing Siddur Lev Chadash 1995: 4) Another key area where John and Chaim went far beyond the Mattuck liturgy, though still bearing the stamp of his inspiration, was in their introduction of a number of 'theme services' with prayers and readings, including classic Jewish texts and some modern non-Jewish ones; so it was that Judah Halevi rubbed shoulders with Walt Whitman and Nachman of Bratzlav with Rabindranath Tagore. The subjects of these twelve themes included nature, righteousness, justice and Israel's mission, and less predictably, and very 'sixties', quest, sincerity and brotherhood. The theme services which were loved by many owe much to Chaim Stern for their creative content and everything else to John for the complementary nature of their arrangement, and the lyrical effect of the whole. John was to take theme services to their liturgical zenith in Siddur Lev Chadash , on which work began in 1982. His vision for the new liturgy was to have at its heart fifty-three theme services, one for every sidra , to be included in either Friday or Saturday services and containing a wide range of material - biblical, rabbinic, medieval and modern, poetry and prose. He charged each of us on the editorial committee to go away and construct six themes, choosing material that we liked and making sure that the pieces were in harmony with each other. European Judaism Volume 45 No. 1 Spring 2012 45</page><page sequence="5">The Contribution of Rabbi John Rayner to Liberal Prayer Books When we had finished we returned our work to John, who took it away, read it through and then came back to us with copious thanks for all our hard work and appreciation of the fine material we had found. Unfortunately, however, our theme services didn't quite match up to his vision and John set out to recast and prepare all fifty-three, a huge task which involved the selection of some 500 separate texts! It is a testimony to his liturgical genius that most of them work extraordinarily well, and testimony to his humanity that one or two work slightly less well, but withal his intention that they be 'a liturgically and educationally valid part of our worship' is fully vindicated (Ibid.: 7). As well as discovering the liturgical potential of classical Jewish writings, John also wrote almost all of the key link passages that hold the themes together, all of which are good and some of which are superb. Here is one example, from the theme of faith: When evil darkens our world, give us light. When despair numbs our souls, give us hope. When we stumble and fall, lift us up. When doubt assails us, give us trust. When nothing seems sure, give us faith. When ideals fade, renew our vision. When we lose our way, be our Guide. So may we find peace in Your presence, and purpose in doing your will. (Ibid.: 220) Siddur Lev Chadash was to be John's last prayer book, and following its publication, he asked Andrew Goldstein and me to take up the editorial mantle and revise Gate of Repentance to be a companion volume to Lev Chadash. It was a daunting task which we undertook with pride and trembling, and we were hugely supported throughout by John, together with our beloved friend Eric Friedland. Machzor Ruach Chadashah may have our names as the editors but we would be the first to say that John was our lodestone and our inspiration. John was also a poet: not a major poet perhaps, but certainly, in the manner of Amos, Micah and Joel, a minor poet, and he brought this side of his artistry to bear on some of the modern Hebrew poems that we included in Lev Chadash and also on the psalms that he wanted to facilitate being sung in Hebrew or English. John's metrical translation of Psalm 23 makes a tried and tested text seem gloriously new: You are my Shepherd and my God, Therefore no want I know; You let me lie in pastures green And where calm waters flow. My weary spirit You revive When I am in distress; 46 European Judaism Volume 45 No. 1 Spring 2012</page><page sequence="6">Charles H . Middleburgh And, for Your name's sake, Lead my steps in paths of righteousness. The darkest valley holds no fear, For You are at my side; Your presence is my comfort still, Your rod and staff my guide. You feast my soul, O God, in spite Of those who wish me ill. With precious oil You soothe my head, My cup with joy you fill. Your love and goodness, steadfastly, Shall follow me always, And in Your house, O God, shall I Dwell to the end of days. (Ibid.: 221) One of John's many characteristics was his willingness to engage with ideas that were initially challenging for him, to think about them, argue them out and if convinced of their innate logic and Tightness, to champion them with the zeal of a doughty j ouster in the medieval lists. One such issue was that of non-gender specific language. Once the work on Lev Chadash had commenced, John was confronted by one or two of our women colleagues about the issue of language and the way it was used, all too carelessly, with regard to gender. It was a challenging subject but one to which he brought his formidable intellect; he thought it through, discussed it with us, and once persuaded of its Tightness fought its corner against considerable opposition. Not only did he win the day, but coincidentally brought fresh nuances to some all too familiar Hebrew terminology for God, adding extra theological depth to its many other facets. When he presented Siddur Lev Chadash , his words on this issue were vintage John: forensically clear, morally incontrovertible and hugely polite and respectful in spite of the bruising battles he had fought: I know that many of our members are by no means persuaded of the need for it, and I don't doubt that the matter will be hotly debated for some time to come. All I can say is that we of the Editorial Committee have no doubt that it was right to make the change, and to restate the case for it in the briefest possible way. On the human level, it seems to us a matter of courtesy as well as equity that we should discontinue the bad habit of subsuming women under men by speaking of our brothers when we mean our brothers and sisters, or of our forefathers when we mean our ancestors, and of ignoring the vital part played by women, from the Matriarchs onwards, in the history of our people. On the divine level, it seems to us that to speak of God constantly and exclusively in masculine nouns and pronouns is inevitably to foster a European Judaism Volume 45 No. 1 Spring 2012 47</page><page sequence="7">The Contribution of Rabbi John Rayner to Liberal Prayer Books male image of God. And the trouble with that is threefold. First, if taken literally, it is grossly anthropomorphic. Secondly, if taken metaphorically, it leads to an over-emphasis on those attributes, like judgement and authority, which we associate with masculinity, and a corresponding under-emphasis on those attributes like understanding and compassion, which we associate with femininity. And the third point, which brings us back to the human level, is that, whether taken literally or metaphorically, to associate divinity with masculinity is a sure-fire way of diminishing the feminine in humanity. [Ibid.: 7) And there is one final aspect of John Rayner's contribution to the creation of Liberal prayer books that cannot be ignored, for if John's liturgies have the quality of jewels, the ruby beyond price is the explanatory notes accompanying them. In the Liberal Jewish Prayerbook Israel Mattuck had restricted himself to a straightforward appendix giving the bare bones of the sources of the prayers: when it came to Service of the Heart John decided to go much further. One paragraph precedes the notes in that siddur, stating: 'In the following notes our main purpose is to identify the sources, including whenever possible authors and dates, and to explain the reasons for any textual changes which we have made and for any translations which require special comment'. (Ibid.: 465) The notes to Gate of Repentance are preceded by an introduction covering three-and-a-quarter pages, and its opening paragraph adds the purpose of explaining 'something of the history and structure of the services and their relation to the traditional Jewish liturgy' (Rayner 1973: 435). And these introductory pages conclude with the following paragraph: In spite of this stylistic diversity and the vast span of time from which it stems, the Jewish liturgy has a pervading unity, partly because of the abundant use which has been made in every period of the Bible and its language, and even more because of the basically unchanged and unchanging universe of ideas and aspirations which it expresses. (Ibid.: 438) The text preceding the notes to Siddur Lev Chadash has shrunk to a mere one paragraph, but the notes in that volume mark the apotheosis of John's vast liturgical knowledge and scholarship, a scholarship which, like John's intellect, never stood still. The notes in the three liturgies that bear John's indelible imprint are eloquent testimony to the liturgical sage who created them, as well as providing a benchmark for good liturgical practice in later editions of siddur or machzor.

We liturgical Lilliputians, who have tried to fill a portion of his mighty footfalls, owe him an incalculable debt.
