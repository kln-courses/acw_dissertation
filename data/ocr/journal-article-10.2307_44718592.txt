ABSTRACT Two alternative methods are presented for studying the comfort, and possibly fatigue, effects of vehicle seats, in particular truck seats that include a seat suspension. The methods, named "aPerms" and "SPD%" for the purpose of this study, are based on analyzing the pressure profile at the seat cushion/human body interface in a manner that accounts for the contact area, pressure distribution, and change in contact pressure. The alternative methods are compared with methods suggested in the past for vehicle seats, using a laboratory test rig and a truck seat with a conventional foam cushion and an air-inflated seat cushion. The results show that the proposed methods better highlight the human comfort differences between the two cushion types, and provide objective measures that better correlate with subjective measures from a separate field study on the same types of seats. INTRODUCTION There has been a trend in the transportation industry over the last 20 years for evaluating ride comfort and fatigue, specifically, in the trucking industry. The trucking industry has recognized the importance of comfort and fatigue with regards to the truck driver's job satisfaction, health, and safety [1], Although many aspects of a vehicle can affect driver comfort and fatigue, one of the most critical elements is the vehicle seat dynamics. This is especially true with commercial truck drivers who are required to drive long and sometimes irregular hours. Ultimately, the vast majority of vehicle vibrations that can cause discomfort and fatigue must pass through the seat to get to the driver. Only recently, however, has the truck seat experienced major improvements. The development of the seat suspension, commonly referred to as "air-ride", has made the seat capable of absorbing the vibrations transferred from the road surface to the driver. The addition of foam or air bolsters, additional contouring, and ergonomie adjustments has provided increased stability and improved seated posture. More recently, the trucking industry has shown a desire to increase comfort using new technologies specifically designed for long-term seating, such as air-inflated seat cushions, as a replacement to the standard urethane foam seat cushion. This requires methods for evaluating and comparing the comfort and fatigue characteristics of the two types of seat cushions. There has been a great deal of research devoted to finding objective measures for predicting the subjective perception of seat comfort. The problem is that the vast majority of objective measures used for evaluating comfort and fatigue, such as SEAT% and Perms, were created based on the comparison of different seat designs with similar types of seat cushions that are widely used in the automotive industry, i.e., urethane foam cushions. The dynamics of air-inflated seat cushions are much more different from the foam cushion in terms of their interface with the human body. Therefore, there is a need for alternative methods of evaluation that can effectively assess the dynamics that are introduced at the interface between the cushion and human body. In this study we evaluate current objective measures for predicting seat comfort. Presently, there are no effective and accepted methods for measuring driver fatigue; therefore, due to the complexities associated with it, only inferences will be made to fatigue. Two objective measures are introduced and implemented as new methods for comparing different classes of seat cushions for truck seats, particularly air-inflated seat cushions and foam seat cushions. A case study using a foam and air-inflated cushion will be used to highlight the results obtained from the new methods that are introduced here, as well as two currently used methods, SEAT% and Perms. 684</page><page sequence="2">OBJECTIVE ANALYSIS METHODS Objective measures for predicting the relative comfort of one seat compared to another can be divided into two categories of vibration analysis methods and interface pressure analysis methods due to the known consequences that vibration and pressure have on the human body. Vibration affects the human body by causing the person to contract muscles in an attempt to dampen vibration [2]. This ultimately results in discomfort and muscle fatigue. High pressure at bony prominences, such as the ischial tuberosities, can cause loss of blood and nutrient flow resulting in discomfort and possibly, fatigue [3]. Other measures, including physiological and anthropomorphic measurements, have also proved influential, but are beyond the scope of the current study. Table 1 provides a summary of objective analysis methods, broken up into categories of vibration and pressure. It includes specific measurements used and the information that results. For the purposes of the current study two objective measures from each category of vibration and pressure were chosen for investigation: Seat Effective Amplitude Transmissibility (SEAT%) and Pressure Change Rate root-mean-square (Perms). These metrics are subsequently used to evaluate and compare seat cushions. Seat Effective Amplitude Transmissibility (SEAT%i A valuable method for comparing one seat to another is the objective measure of Seat Effective Amplitude Transmissibility (SEAT%), which is defined as Gss{fWhf)df Í- 1 1 / 2 Gss{fWhf)df Í- ów/ o= -s XlOO (1) j Gff(J)W?(J)df This method is a measure of the transmission of acceleration from the floor to the seat cushion where GJf) and G „(f) are the seat and floor power spectra, respectively. The frequency dependent weighting factor Wj(f), as defined in Table 2, is based on research of human discomfort [5]. Table 2. Frequency Dependent Weighting Factors for Calculating SEAT% [5] Frequency Range Weighting Factor 0.5 &lt; f &lt; 2.0 W(f) = 0.4 2.0 &lt;f&lt; 5.0 W(f) = f/5.00 5.0 &lt;f&lt; 16.0 W(f) = 1.00 16.0 &lt;f&lt; 80.0 W(f) = 1 6/f The method is especially valuable in evaluating automotive seats because it incorporates human discomfort levels to vibration in all three axes. A value of 100% would indicate that the seat is providing no isolation and is no more comfortable than sitting on the floor of the vehicle. Decreasing values indicate a more comfortable seat. There is no accepted method of relating a value of SEAT% to the level of comfort or discomfort incurred. It is more useful as a quantitative tool for comparing different seats. Pressure Change Rate Root-Mean Square fPcrmst Researchers at Daihatsu Motor Co, Ltd, when comparing three different types of foam seats, found that pressure change rate root-mean-square (Perms) was the most accurate measure for "unpleasant sensations" due to transient vibrations [9]. Perms is calculated as follows: Pcnm"'f' I^r)'*} (2) where T is the total time period and P(t) is the dynamic pressure. The research suggests that a lower pressure change rate will result in a more comfortable seat cushion. Similar to SEAT%, there is no threshold value that separates a comfortable seat from an uncomfortable one. There is also no difference in Perms values that indicates a discrepancy in perceived comfort. Perms, however, can be used as on objective comparison for evaluating different seat cushions made of similar materials. CASE STUDY The following case study evaluates two currently used comfort metrics, SEAT% and Perms, when applied to two different types of truck seat cushions; a standard urethane foam seat cushion and a replacement air- inflated seat cushion. Furthermore, two new metrics are presented as methods of highlighting the differences between different classes of seat cushions. The experimental setup including input excitation signals, test equipment and data acquisition methods are included in a companion paper by the authors [11]. Seat Effective Amplitude Transmissibility (SEAT%i As shown in Figure 2, application of the objective measure of SEAT% to the dynamic evaluation of the two seat configurations resulted in only a small difference of 6%. 685</page><page sequence="3">Table 1 .

SEAT% Comparison Between Foam and Air- Inflated Configurations The fact that the SEAT% results in nearly the same values for the tow types of seat cushions may be explained by looking at the transmissibility plots. Figure 3 shows that seat cushions had very little effect on the resonant frequency or on the frequency at which isolation occurs. The seat suspension absorbs most of the gross input vibration from the floor and the dynamics of the seat cushions are comparatively negligible. As intuitively may be apparent, in the case of a seat with a soft suspension - such as the seat used in this study - the vibration measurements at the seat cushion are strongly influenced by the seat suspension. Therefore, using acceleration on the seat cushion alone does not allow for assessing the dynamic effect of the seat cushion on what is perceived by the driver; or more precisely, the dynamic interface between the cushion and the seated person. This indicates that a metric such as SEAT% would not be suitable for comparing different classes of seat cushions, although it could be quite valid for studying different types of seat suspensions. Figure 4. Vertical Transmissibility (Base Acceleration Divided By Floor Acceleration and Seat Acceleration Divided By Floor Acceleration); (a) Standard Foam Cushion (b) Air-Inflated Cushion Pressure Change Rate (Pcrmst Figures 4 and 5 show the application of Perms in evaluating the two seat configurations. Quite similar to SEAT%, there is very little difference in dynamic performance between the foam and air-inflated seat cushions. This smaller difference is due to the fact that Perms is ultimately a measure of the rate of change of pressure on the cushion. It is most suitable for assessing discomfort due to transient vibrations. Although the IS02 input that we used for our testing did include some transient aspects, they were overridden by the steady state components of the signal. Another element that contributed to the results in Figure 5 is the fact that the truck seat in our study includes a seat suspension, unlike the automobile seats that were used in [9]. As stated earlier for SEAT%, the seat suspension dominates most of the transient dynamics and the effect of the seat cushion is masked. It is worth noting that neither SEAT% nor Perms could capture the obvious differences in the seat cushion/body interface, which are shown in Figure 6 for the two cushions tested in this study. The foam cushion shows areas of high pressure not found in the air-inflated cushion pressure distribution 688</page><page sequence="6">profile. The air-inflated cushion demonstrates the ability to more uniformly distribute the applied load. The lower pressures are also due, in part, to increased contact area. Therefore, there is a need for objective metrics, such as those that will be discussed next, that are capable of illustrating the differences between different classes of seat cushions. Figure 5. Comparison of Pressure Change Rate; (a) Standard Foam Cushion (b) Air-Inflated Cushion Figure 6. Comparison of Perms for Foam and Air- Inflated Cushions Area Pressure Change Rate (aPcrmst There are inherent health issues with sitting for long periods of time. When sitting on a surface, the soft tissues can be compressed and deformed by the underlying skeletal structure (bony prominence), particularly at the ischial tuberosities [12]. At extreme pressures this creates an obstruction of the blood supply resulting in a deficiency of oxygen to tissue cells resulting in discomfort and possibly fatigue. For this reason it is believed that the pressure distribution at the human/seat interface must be incorporated into any objective measurement of comfort and/or fatigue. A new method suggested for comparing seat cushions from interface pressure measurements is Area Pressure Change Rate (aPerms). The method is an adaptation of Perms to include the pressure distribution of the seated person. 4 APcrms = ^ A(r¡ )Pcrms(r¡)W (r¡ ) (3) !'= 1 For each of the n individual pressure cells an average pressure, pm(n), is calculated over the test run. Each area A(r,) is determined by calculating the total area of cells with average pressure within the specified pressure ranges, r¡. There are N=4 pressure ranges where r¡ defines the ilh pressure range. The weighted pressure change rate, Peritisi), is the average Perms of cells within each pressure range. A weighting factor, W(r¡), is incorporated for each pressure range. The pressure ranges and weighting factors are defined in Table 3. Figure 7.

Past studies have established that the partial pressure of oxygen (P02) in the arterial blood is at about 95 mmHg, and the P02 in the interstitial fluid immediately outside the capillary is approximately 40 mmHg. Therefore, a pressure difference of 55 mmHg exists and causes diffusion of oxygen into the cells. If peak pressures in the tissue exceed 95-mmHg, then the cells are deprived of oxygen. Therefore, we select a higher weighting factor for pressures exceeding 60 mmHg, and increase it every 20 mmHg to more accurately reflect the higher pressures on the human tissue. For the purposes of this study the following procedure was used to calculated aPerms: 1 . Determine the contact area, A(r¡) from the pressure map data for each of the following pressure ranges - 40 to 60mmHg, 60 to 80mmHg, 80 to 1 0OmmHg, and greater than 1 0OmmHg. 2. Determine cells with average pressure greater than 40mmHg. 3. Eliminate bad pressure data by computing the average pressure reading and standard deviation for each cell over an entire test run. Eliminate any pressure reading that is greater than +3 standard deviations of the average. Recalculate average pressure reading for each cell. 4. Calculate Perms for each cell. 5. Calculate an average Perms, defined as Pcrms^), within each of the following pressure ranges - 40 to 60mmHg, 60 to 80mmHg, 80 to 1 0OmmHg, and greater than 1 0OmmHg. 6. Calculate a "Weighted Perms" for each of the pressure ranges - 1 times the average Perms for 40 to 60mmHg, 2 times the average Perms for 60- 80mmHg, 3 times the average Perms for 80 to 1 0OmmHg, and 4 times the average Perms for greater than 1 0OmmHg. 7. Calculate the aPcrms(r¡) by multiplying each weighted Perms value by the corresponding contact area A(r¡). 8. Calculate aPerms by summing each value of aPcrms(r,). Figure 7 shows a comparison of aPerms values for the standard foam and air-inflated seat cushions. The aPerms accounts for the pressure distribution, contact area, and the rate of change of pressure across the seated area. A larger contact area along with a smaller pressure distribution and lower rate of change results in a smaller aPerms value. The results shown in Figure 7 indicate that the air-inflated cushion yields an aPerms that is 58% lower than foam cushions. The subjective field-testing that has been conducted in another study shows a direct correlation between the aPerms numbers and ride comfort [13]. The results of that study show that the lower the aPerms is, the higher the seat cushion is rated in subjective evaluations for both comfort (short time exposure) and fatigue (long- time exposure). Figure 8. aPerms Comparison Between an Air-Inflated and Foam Cushion Seat Pressure Distribution (SPD%) Research in seat comfort has established a positive relationship between uniform pressure distribution and perceived comfort [14]. Furthermore, lower pressures are always more desirable in terms of long-term tissue integrity. Since a uniform pressure alleviates high concentrated pressure, we assume that a more uniform distribution is better in terms of comfort and fatigue. One way of quantitatively measuring the ability of a seat cushion to uniformly distribute pressure is with Seat Pressure Distribution (SPD%), defined as: ¿( Pi-Pmf SPD% = 5 X 1 00 (4) This method is used in conjunction with a body pressure mapping system where n is the total number of nonzero cell elements, p¡ is the pressure at the ith cell, and pm is the mean pressure of the n elements. A lower percentage value describes a more uniform pressure distribution at the seat cushion. For a perfectly uniform distributed seat cushion each pressure p, would be equal to the mean pressure pm resulting in a value of zero. Note that SPD% can be used for both static and 690</page><page sequence="8">dynamic environments. A dynamic SPD% calculation uses the average pressure from each individual pressure-sensing element over a test run. Furthermore, a time trace of SPD% can be examined to determine the ability of the seat cushion to maintain uniform pressure. Evaluation of the foam and air-inflated seat cushions with a cushion loading indentor demonstrated the dynamic differences between the two cushions, using SPD%. Figures 8 and 9 show the dynamic seat percent distribution of the foam and air-inflated seat cushions. The air-inflated seat cushion displays more evenly distributed pressure. Also, the distribution remains relatively constant compared with the high changes associated with the foam cushion. Figure 9. Time Comparison of Seat Percent Distribution (SPD%) for Foam and Air-Inflated Seat Cushions Figure 10. Dynamic SPD% Comparison of Foam and Air-Inflated Seat Cushions SUMMARY This study provided two alternative methods for studying the comfort, and possibly fatigue, effects of vehicle seats, in particular truck seats that include a seat suspension. The methods, named "aPerms" and "SPD%" for the purpose of this study, were based on analyzing the pressure profile at the seat cushion/human body interface in a manner that accounts for the contact area, pressure distribution, and change in contact pressure. The alternative methods were compared with methods suggested in the past for vehicle seats. A laboratory rig for testing truck seats was used for the purpose of establishing the comparison between the methods suggested here and those suggested in past studies. Two different types of seat cushions, namely a conventional foam cushion and an air-inflated seat cushion were used to evaluate how well different methods can assess the comfort and possibly fatigue aspects of each type of seat cushions. The results show that the methods proposed in this study better highlight the human comfort differences between the two cushions, and provide objective measures that better correlate with subjective measures from a separate field study on the same type of seats.
