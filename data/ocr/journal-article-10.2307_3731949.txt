<plain_text><page sequence="1">PASCOLI, SHELLEY, AND ISABELLA ANDERTON, 'GENTLE ROTSKETTOW' A faint yet distinct flavour of English poetry pervading most of Pascoli's verse seldom escapes Italian readers who have some acquaintance with the English language at a literary level. Until recently, however, speculation about particular sources has revealed itself anything but conclusive, except, of course, when Pascoli himself acknowledges his debt to English models; but, as I shall further recall, that evidence is scanty and strictly limited to the few translations inserted in the Italian anthologies Sul limitare and Fior da fiore. For the rest, his command of English language and literature continues to a large extent to remain doubtful. Philip Horne1 has justly indicated that two contributions may be singled out as equally representative of this century-old critical impasse: Alfredo Galletti's La poesia e l'arte di Giovanni Pascoli (Rome, I918) and Mario Praz's Giovanni Pascoli e l'Inghilterra, in Omaggio a Giovanni Pascoli nel centenario della nascita (Milan, I955), pp. 321-27. Galletti draws up a copious but mainly random list of parallels assembled from general nineteenth-century literature, most of which could scarcely be regarded as persuasive or reliable in any degree. Praz stresses, on the contrary, the very real difficulty of establishing particular influences, apart from such sporadic instances as the 'vento occidentale'2 which is likely to be an allusion to (or rather, a calque deriving from) Shelley's Ode to the West Wind. One knows only too well Pascoli's ability to confuse the trail, to frustrate, that is, any speculation about the sources on which he actually drew. Dealing with possible influences of English poets in a concise passage of his introduction to Canti di Castelvecchio (Milan, 1983), Giuseppe Nava makes the apparently self-evident statement that 'il Pascoli riprenda da Shelley l'analogia tra l'allodola e il poeta' (p. 15). But a rapid investigation in the Archives ofCasa Pascoli3 shows that the real source of Pascoli's simile (in The Hammerless Gun, 11. I07-I6) is to be found in a passage from an undated letter written by Adolfo De Bosis soon after having presented his friend with the famous hammerless gun: Ho avuto molto piacere che ti sia giunto gradito il fucile. In che grande perplessita ero io per la scelta! io, profano. Imagina che quando mi ha chiesto se lo volevo coi cani o senza cani, ho pensato: Ma i cani ... io non sono qui per comperare i cani! che diavolo! - Poi ho capito e ho scelto quello, sistema hammerless (che vuol dire senza martelli). Va bene? Hai ricevuto le cariche? la bretella (si chiama cosi?) del fucile l'ho fatta mettere al suo astuccio. E ora, in bocca al lupo, si dice a Roma; cioe: buona caccia. Ma risparmia le allodole, che sono i poeti del cielo! (xxxi, I8, 37; my italics)4 1 Philip Home, 'Pascoli, Tennyson, and Gabriele Briganti', MLR, 80 ( 985), 833-44. 2 In II dovere (first published in II Marzocco, 3 December 1905; later in Odi e Inni), 33-36. 3 Manuscripts preserved in the Archives of Casa Pascoli at Castelvecchio are quoted according to a sequence of three numbers: the first (in Roman numerals) indicates the drawer; the second and third refer to folder and folio respectively. When letters are quoted, the sheet number is sometimes omitted. 4 For echoes of De Bosis's letter, see not only The Hammerless Gun, 11. 107-16 (the section entitled L'allodola), but also lines 9-Io ('Un hammerless. Sapete? | che non ha cani: a triplice chiusura') and lines i5-i6. That Pascoli knew Shelley's The Skylark may almost certainly be inferred from La calandra, in Poemetti (second edition), first published in La Vita Italiana, I6 November 1897 - a little less than a year after De Bosis's suggestion (which possibly acted as a stimulus for Pascoli's becoming directly acquainted with The Skylark), and the subsequent composition of The Hammerless Gun (La Tribuna, I I January 1897). A further parallel is made by Nava between II sonnellino, 11. 1 3- 6, and The Sensitive Plant, 11. 102-03. That this was not Pascoli's direct source might be inferred from another letter by De Bosis, published in Maria Pascoli, Lungo la vita di G.P. (Milan, 1961) (hereafter Lv), p. 743, where De Bosis combines two passages</page><page sequence="2">Pascoli, Shelley, and Isabella Anderton Similarly Nadia Ebani devoted some thirty pages of a learned study (II gelsomino notturno nelle carte pascoliane, in Studi difilologia e letteratura italiana offerti a Carlo Dionisotti (Milan and Naples, 1973), pp. 453-50 ) to the effort of shedding light on the (chiefly Italian) literary suggestions possibly underlying the composition of II gelsomino notturno, but she omitted to mention the only relevant precedent, a poem by Guido Mazzoni, from which two stanzas deserve to be reproduced: Ti rivedremo mai, cheto giardino, ove sotto le stelle errammo tanto? Olezzando si apriva il gelsomino notturno a ber de le rugiade il pianto; e gli alberi stormian quasi per festa, che sapean l'amor nostro e l'avvenir. Ecco una nuova culla oggi si appresta; pur vuole un pargoletto in vita uscir. (1. 17) The explicit mention of the flower as related to the celebration of Mazzoni's own marriage, soon to be blessed by the birth of a child, affords adequate evidence for putting Pascoli in debt to this contemporary scholar. That poem, like the rest of Mazzoni's poetical work, has little aesthetic merit; Pascoli nevertheless included it in his anthology Fior dafiore, which is dated 190o but had appeared as early as winter i900, a little less than a year before the publication of the poem which celebrated Gabriele Briganti's wedding.5 There is no doubt that such mistakes (not infrequent on the part of critics) corroborate Pascoli's propensity for turning to poetic advantage second-hand material which is often gathered not from famous and familiar models but from sources so unexpected as to make correct identification difficult. But was this practice intended to conceal his inability to read and interpret English texts correctly? That suspicion has long given rise to serious doubts about the solidity of his linguistic education. Pascoli, however, knew his English well enough to manage it with skill for his poetic purposes, as argued recently by Philip Home. I shall now adduce new evidence which, I hope, supports the same conclusion. When I first entered Casa Pascoli about ten years ago, I was concerned with investigating Pascoli's library as a whole, starting from the bookshelves devoted to non-Italian authors. Unfortunately, among the comparatively small array of English works (some in the original, some in translation) I found none, apart from Shelley's precious book of poems (to be further discussed later), which contained comments in Pascoli's hand as enlightening as the valuable marginal notes in the treatises by Sully and Muller.6 In subsequent years I gathered only an equally into a single quotation: namely, The Sensitive Plant, 11. 25-28, and Epipsychidion 11. 83-86. There is a close similarity in both passages with Digitale purpurea's leading theme. De Bosis seems to hint at a store of quotations that would be familiar to his friend, whom he had introduced to English romantic poetry long before. S Compare Fior dafiore (Milan and Palermo, 1902), pp. 539-40: Lafamigliola operosa, with the footnote: 'di Guido Mazzoni. II titolo di questa bellissima poesia e A mia moglie'. Il gelsomino notturno first appeared as a wedding-present in the pamphlet A Gabriele Briganti/nelle sue nozze/xxl Luglio MCMI, Lucca. 6 Etudes sur l'enfance, translation by A. Monod (Paris, 1898), of James Sully, Studies of Childhood (1895); Max Miiller, Letturesopra la scienza del linguaggio, translated by Gherardo Nerucci di Pistoia (Milano, 1864). 52</page><page sequence="3">MAURIZIO PERUGI meagre harvest of loose sheets from the Archives, containing excerpts from original English texts (Shakespeare and Marlowe), grammatical and lexical exercises (in connexion with Italy), and finally a few pleasant discoveries like this note on a Garfagnana dialect word: 'brotteglia meta in inglese, meta in italiano (brontola, borbotta)' (LXXIII, 2, 202).7 A decisive step forward was achieved with the recognition of a text not to be found in Pascoli's library, but mentioned by the poet himself on several occasions, the most significant being in a typewritten version of a lecture from the course delivered in 1906 at the University of Bologna. This was Herbert Spencer's Philosophy of Style, on which, as far as I can see, Pascoli began to rely as early as 1896. Spencer's pamphlet is relevant from two points of view. From it Pascoli picked up a stanza of Tennyson's Mariana, to be woven into the text of La servetta di monte - possibly the first case in which the influence on Pascoli of an English model (not openly acknowledged, of course) may be traced beyond dispute. But the Philosophy, like the treatises by Miiller and Sully, was also a powerful stimulus during the formation of Pascoli's aesthetic and linguistic theories, right down to the succinct formulation of them inserted as an introductory note to the Garfagnino glossary (appended to the second edition of Canti di Castelvecchio).8 It should be noted in the first place that Spencer's pamphlet affords conclusive evidence, even beyond what would be strictly necessary, for Pascoli's characteristic bent for drawing upon second-hand sources. Certainly (as Philip Horne has shown) he had read some of Tennyson in the original text; but in the event he unquestion- ably derived the Mariana passage from the quotation included in Spencer's third chapter. A second and even more important conclusion is that Pascoli's relationship with English was also an indirect one. In his view, as inspired by Spencer's stylistic principles, English chiefly functions as a lexical store and also as a 'model' in today's scientific sense of the word. That is to say, it could serve as a linguistic pattern or standard, according to which Italian modern poetic diction could be reconstructed on completely renewed grounds. English vocabulary seems often to consist of a twofold layer: monosyllables of Anglo-Saxon origin alternate and contrast with longer words inherited from the Latin and Anglo-Norman traditions. The greater poetic force of the former derives from their brevity, onomatopoeic character, and, according to Spencer, their earlier association; furthermore, their expressive poten- tial is enriched by their property of allowing the radical syllable to stand out prominently in the word-chain.9 Such are the chief principles according to which Italian literary language could be made more supple, by diminishing its propensity to use generic, colourless, and many-syllabled words, where stress almost invariably falls on the final two syllables, thus producing a tiresome monotony. 7 But instead of using such a harsh dialect word (the Latin for which would be mussare, applied in the Carmina to boiling pots as well), Pascoli had actually recourse to a metaphor drawn from Garfagnana folklore: 'qui, quando la pentola fa i sonagli, dicono che passano i miccetti': that is, 'when a pot is bubbling, people here say, donkeys are passing by' (Note to Canti di Castelvecchio, second edition (Bologna, 1903); and compare La servetta di monte, 11. i6-i8). 8 For a detailed discussion the reader should refer to my selection Giovanni Pascoli, dai Canti di Castelvecchio (Milan, 982), and to the article 'Morfologia di una lingua morta' in Convegno internazionale di studi pascoliani, n (Barga, 1988), pp. 171-233, where I attempt to reconstruct the main principles of Pascoli's linguistic theory. 9 This additional feature results from contamination with Miller's Letture, where it is actually - and more rightly - referred to the so-called agglutinative languages, the general structure of which is implicitly regarded by Pascoli as a secondary model along with English, odd though such a hybridization may seem at first sight. 53</page><page sequence="4">Pascoli, Shelley, and Isabella Anderton Pascoli's linguistic theory is not particularly germane to the present discussion, which aims chiefly at bringing into focus his personal attitude towards a language which he perceived more as an aesthetically-relevant model for word-formation than as the medium of communication peculiar to one of the most prominent literatures in the Western world. To Pascoli, English was not as familiar as French, which he had studied in his schooldays, or Latin and Greek, which from his early youth he was able to acquire with such skill. Later learning added, of course, to his particular way of perceiving English as through an interposed screen. I shall show that this attitude did not prevent a full understanding of English poetry at its loftiest levels. It is well known that Pascoli began to study English literature with the assistance of Gabriele Briganti who, self-taught though he was, had been appointed teacher of English language at the Scuole Tecniche Commerciali in Lucca, where he was later elected Director of the Biblioteca Governativa. He described how he met Pascoli in that library during the summer of 1896, on the occasion of one of the poet's visits from Castelvecchio, where he was spending his vacation for the second consecutive year. At the next meeting Pascoli came to the point: 'M'hanno detto che lei sa l'inglese. Ho tradotto 1' Ulisse del Tennyson in esametri, nel metro cioe dell'originale, ma di due versi non sono affatto tranquillo. Me li veda un po' lei.'l? Such was the beginning of a long and fruitful collaboration, particularly in the fields of English and German literature. Briganti used to provide his friend with 'il testo originale con la traduzione letterale e qualche volta anche con uno schema metrico. Da quella scelta egli a sua volta sceglieva con gusto meraviglioso fior da fiore, ritraducendo dagli originali, in versi'. Briganti takes a pride in having recommended that Shelley's Time Long Past be inserted in the anthology Sul limitare, for which he had been asked to revise the translation of Tennyson's Ulysses. The extant correspondence with Pascolill begins with a postcard dated 19 August 1898 in which, after asking for Gautier's Roland, Tommaseo's Canti Greci e Illirici, and Victor Hugo's Legendes des Siecles,l2 Pascoli concludes: 'Ella mi raccolga, di grazia, sollecitamente qualche bel fiore esotico o semplicemente straniero - inglese, francese, tedesco - da tradursi o tradotto.'13 To quote another letter, dated I8 July Igoo: 'Vorrei qualcuna di quelle poesie uso Siamo sette di Wordsworth, che ho tradotta tralasciando l'insulsa prima strofa. Qualche cosa di Longfellow. Coraggio. Mi aiuti.' Briganti's answer is on a card 10 See Gabriele Briganti, 'Testimonianze e valutazioni pascoliane', in Giovanni Pascoli, edited byJolanda de Blasi (Florence, i937), pp. 173-97; later in Atti dell'Accademia Lucchese di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti, n.s., 6 (Lucca, 1948), pp. 87- 07. 11 Pascoli's letters to Briganti are published in Giovanni Pascoli, Lettere agli amici lucchesi, edited by Felice Del Beccaro (Florence, I960), pp. 341-59. Briganti's correspondence as preserved in the Archives (xxvi, 23) runs to seven letters, two telegrams, and sixteen postcards. 12 In the following letters, too, Pascoli would periodically ask for different authors, to be turned to poetic advantage to supplement his own choice of themes (Barzellotti, Plutarch, Chiarini, Nieri, and others). 13 Briganti's answer (undated) reads: Illustre e buon signore, EccoLe le traduzioni dal Tennyson e dallo Shelley. Ho tradotto, com'Ella vedra, alla lettera, e ho anche riprodotto il testo inglese perche Ella possa confrontare. Se ne desidera ancora continuero ben volentieri. Mi permetto di farLe notare la famosa poesia del Tennyson- The Charge of the Light Brigade; la quale Ella sola, in Italia, potrebbe degnamente tradurre. Mi par molto bella; e ogni volta che la leggo io ripenso al Suo meraviglioso inno a Fratti. La tradurra? Molto volentieri raccoglier6 per Lei, illustre poeta buono, qualche bel fiore inglese o francese, da tradursi, o tradotto. Sarei cosi lieto se potessi in qualche modo riuscirLe utile! No doubt at the outset Briganti is referring to Ulysses and Time Long Past, both included in the first edition of Sul limitare (Milan and Palermo, I900). 54</page><page sequence="5">MAURIZIO PERUGI postmarked 17 August: 'Ho potuto avere il Longfellow, dove cerchero subito qualche cosa per la sua Antologia. E anche la Browning? Vuole di quest'ultima il pianto dei bimbi? E molto bella; ed e tradotta assai bene dal Chiarini. Ma posso darle, se la vuole, una versione in prosa, io.' On 3 April 190I Pascoli asks for more 'lettere, traduzioni, di tutto un po' e un bel po'. This friendly association was to become closer in the following year, when on 28 February Pascoli was able to take possession of his home at Caprona, and on 12 August Dante Giovanni Briganti came into the world: from then on the child, instead of the father, was often playfully chosen by Pascoli as addressee of his letters. If Gabriele Briganti is sufficiently familiar to Pascoli scholars, the same can hardly be said of Isabella M. Anderton, who none the less played an even more significant part in Pascoli's education in English literature. The following summary of her life is drawn from the biographical note appended to her posthumous volume, a copy of which is to be found in Pascoli's library: Tuscan Folk-Lore and Sketches Together with Some Other Papers, edited, with a biographical note, by her brothers H. Orsmond Anderton and Basil Anderton (London, I905).14 Isabella Anderton was born at Lower Clapton near London in October i858. After matriculating at London University in 1877, and studying German for a year at Cannstadt, she returned to Clapton, where she taught for four years at Priory House School, kept by her father. Owing to the weakness of her health in 1883 she went to Italy and lived for some years with a family at Genoa, teaching the children and writing. In I887, in consequence of another breakdown, she went up to the Apennines above Pistoia and stayed in Prunetta and Cutigliano, where she pursued her beloved Italian studies, coming closely into touch with the peasants of the neighbourhood and interesting herself in their folklore and way of life (it will be recalled that Pascoli was to have similar relations with Zi Meo and other neighbours at Castelvecchio). In October 1890 she married Rodolfo Debarbieri, and the couple moved from Genoa to Florence, where their only child, a son, was born in 1891. In 1899 she was appointed to the English Chair in the Collegio della SS. Annunziata, but, her health worsening, in I900 and I902 she had to undergo two operations. After a temporary, illusory recovery, she fell ill again in July I904, and she died in the following December. She was buried in the Protestant cemetery of the Allori, at the foot of an avenue of cypresses: the motto she once adopted, Ad Augusta per Angusta, is inscribed on her gravestone. The biographical note, from which this information is taken, describes her linguistic ability. Her command of Italian and knowledge of the literature were extraordinary, and in fact during later years she was often taken for an Italian, on one occasion asking a friend rather ruefully if it were true that she spoke English with an accent. French and German, too, were at her command, as well as Latin, and to a lesser extent Greek. The note goes on to mention a missing study of the character of Virgil's Dido, and above all her translation into English of Domenico Comparetti's Traditional Poetry of 14 Pascoli's copy is inscribed: 'In ricordo della Signora Isabella Anderton/Luisa Ruglioni di Viste'. With regard to Luisa Ruglioni, see the dedication in another English book of Pascoli's, Mother Goose's Nursery Rhymes. Tales andJingles (London and New York [undated]): 'A Giovanni Pascoli con auguri per l'anno nuovo e saluti, invia queste umili "myricae" cresciute sul suolo Brittanno Luisa Ruglioni di Viste/ Ripafratta 29 Xbre 04'. A letter from this lady concerning the Palizzolo trial (see Lv, pp. 745-47) is preserved in the Archives (xLIv, 15, i6). 55</page><page sequence="6">56 Pascoli, Shelley, and Isabella Anderton the Finns.1s (It is worth recalling that both Elissa and Vainam6inen are significant characters in Pascoli's poetic world.) For about ten years she was Florence correspondent of The Studio. After becoming acquainted with the Orvietos and their circle, she contributed also to II Marzocco, in which Angiolo Orvieto himself wrote her obituary just after her death.16 The same Angiolo Orvieto had introduced Mrs Anderton to Pascoli on a postcard dated from Florence, 29 May 1899: Una scrittrice inglese valentissima, la Signora Isabella Anderton, intende compiere uno studio sull'opera tua e mi prega di fornirgliene i materiali. Vorresti tu regalarle copia delle Myricae e dei Poemetti? Mi faresti un vero piacere, e sono certo che te ne troveresti bene; perche detta Signora e lettrice assidua del Marzocco. (XL, 7, 65) The Anderton correspondence in the Archives runs to ten letters, dating from 27 August 1899 to 23 August 1904, the last being written by H. Amy Anderton for her ailing sister. The only extant letter from Pascoli to 'gentle Rotskettow' (the nickname appears, to my knowledge, nowhere else) is to be found in Lucca, Biblioteca Governativa (see Del Beccaro, p. 347, note I4 of his study quoted above). To judge from the portrait facing her book's title-page, Isabella was a charming woman, with dark hair and deep, pensive eyes. Her letters betray an intelligent, refined, and melancholy nature, together with a boundless admiration for Pascoli, whom apparently she never had a chance to meet. She introduces herself to him as lying beneath an olive tree and reading Virgil and the Myricae alternately, or staring from her sick-bed at a telegraph wire profiled against a misty sky through the grating of her window. To Pascoli scholars she is known only as having collaborated in the translation of Wordsworth's poem We Are Seven for the anthology Fior da fiore, as Pascoli himself acknowledged in a footnote (p. I26), but the collection of her letters makes clear that her share in Pascoli's initiation into English literature was far more substantial.17 From one of her first letters she appears to have supplied Pascoli with a garbled Italian version of Tennyson's Ulysses as early as 1898, that is, before entering into correspondence with him. Juan Biondi acted as intermediary on that occasion, even though, to judge by Isabella's words, that version may never have come into Pascoli's hands. In this and further letters she discusses in detail some word-for- word renderings of Ulysses, corroborates on two occasions Briganti's testimony about Pascoli's interest in Longfellow, expresses sound reservations on Mazzoni's handling of metre and D'Annunzio's life style, and finally, reveals her firm grasp of prosody by stating a view about the expressive qualities of spondees, which is wholly in keeping with a paragraph in the posthumous metrical treatise on which Pascoli was then working. 15 Domenico Comparetti, The Traditional Poetry of the Finns, translated by Isabella M. Anderton, with an introduction by Andrew Lang (London, 1898). In a folder containing the drafts and fair copy of I sonno di Odisseo (Archives LIv, 7) is a loose sheet in pencil: 'Yesterday Comparetti read,for the first time, a poem of Pascoli's (II sonno di Odisseo) and pronounced it not bad!!.' No doubt Comparetti's opinion was transmitted to Pascoli by none other than Mrs Anderton, in view of the recurrence of the words 'not bad' in a letter of Pascoli's dealing with her, and dated 8 August I899 (see Giulio Tognacci, Ricordi pascoliani, Rimini 1939, p. 14 ). That letter was written only a few months after the composition of Il sonno di Odisseo, the fair copy of which is dated 'Messina. Gennaio del 1899' (the poem was soon to appear in La Nuova Antologia, I6 February 1899, and was finally included in Poemi Conviviali). It is well known that Pascoli was not on good terms with Comparetti, a member of the commission that twice rejected his Dante studies competing for the Lincei prize. 16 II Marzocco, 25 dicembre 1904. 17 In Lv Isabella Anderson [sic: the wrong spelling is used in the index of proper names, too] appears only once, on page 623, note i.</page><page sequence="7">MAURIZIO PERUGI But she had long been wanting a closer collaboration with her illustrious pen-friend. At the outset Pascoli, a few months after receiving a selection of Shelley's poems as a gift from her, asked Adolfo De Bosis to forward to her his translation of The Cenci with a view to eliciting a suitable subject for ajoint project. This came to nothing, but at the beginning of 1902 Pascoli made Isabella a far more important proposal: she was to supervise a translation of Shakespeare's complete works by a group of collaborators to be recruited in the Marzocco circle. The project was intended for a volume to be published by Remo Sandron in the series La biblioteca dei popoli, of which Pascoli had been appointed general editor. The ups and downs of the series as a whole can be traced through the letters ofPavo- lini and Sandron, so far as they are preserved in the Archives. Paolo Emilio Pavolini was Professor of Sanskrit in Florence: the first two of his extant letters (XLI, I I) deal with the Sentenze indiane to be inserted in the second edition of Fior dafiore, together with the Canti di zingari, another of his translations. On 23 May g90 he forwarded to Pascoli the introductory note to II XLI runo del Kalevala. This specimen of Finnish poetry, and in Pavolini's translation, is in Pascoli's view one of the most significant novelties of Sul limitare in its second and enlarged edition (see his Nota per gli alunni, p. xviii). Finally a postcard dated 27 April I902 supplies some suggestions about early epic poetry of which Pascoli was soon to take advantage in the second chapter of the definitive reworking of II Fanciullino.18 Pavolini's hand is also apparent in the draft of the notice advertising the forthcoming publication of La biblioteca dei popoli, the first volume of which was to be just the Mahabharata in his own translation. At the outset Sandron, with a view to announcing the new series in the winter of 1901 , was pressing more and more for the Manifesto to be drafted.19 Pascoli, however, appears not to have complied with his urgent request even as late as I May 1902, the date of Pavolini's letter in which a sheet was enclosed containing a few suggestions for the Manifesto.20 Once the notice is written, it is Sandron's turn to procrastinate: on 23 May he apologizes for not having yet kept his promise of forwarding the page-proofs; he still lacks the block with which the painter De Carolis had been entrusted in the December before! In the following year Sandron keeps putting forward new pretexts for delaying printing and distribution of the Manifesto: he complains to Pascoli about the preponderance of Orientalists in the planned series. Meanwhile the proofs of Metrica, about which for many years he had been chiefly concerned, are turning yellow with age.21 18 'Mio carissimo collega: Oggi soltanto due parole, per dirLe che ha ragione. I1 poeta era anche il sapiente, e per alcuni il mago (Vainam6inen) quindi doveva esser vecchio. Anche il supposto autore del Mahabh., l'asceta Vyasa, e invecchiato nella penitenza e padrone di tutta la dottrina sacra e profana. Ossian e vecchio, e vecchi molti degli skaldi nordici. Potessi avere le bozze del Suo studio, oserei forse di segnare qualche noterella in margine.' This postcard gives an approximate date to a draft of Chapter 2 of II Fanciullino, in the Archives LXXIX, I, I2I, where in a marginal note Pascoli has written: 'Pavolini/ Anderton', no doubt as memorandum for two letters to be written. 19 See six of Sandron's letters dated between June and December (Archives xLv, 1-2). 20 I hope to reproduce this letter along with other documents in a subsequent article. 21 See Sandron's letters, dated 3January 1903: 'Ma io non sospendo affatto la Biblioteca dei Popoli, n6 l'ho mai detto. Ho detto solo che continuer6 adagio. Ed aspetto appunto che ci sia qualche altro volume per lanciare il Manifesto, che non poteva essere lanciato nella stagione morta, cioe quando Lei lo licenzi6, n6 nella riapertura delle scuole'; 25 February I903: 'Le faccio stampar subito la carta, ma il cliche Glielo mander6 dopo stampato il Manifesto, manifesto che gia Le scrissi perch6 non si stampo prima.

Complesse ne sono le cause, n6 ora io vorrei qui esaminarle. Forse (in principio almeno) alle opere di interesse non generale o gia altrimenti note o facilmente trovabili, ne sarebbero andate anteposte altre assolutamente rare e che avessero potuto interessare un pubblico piu numeroso. In ogni modo il fatto doloroso e questo, che la Biblioteca non ebbe alcun esito e neanche dopo la diffusione su larghissima scala che io feci del Suo splendido programma fu possibile ottenere un risveglio qualsiasi. Ci sarebbe da disperare dell'incoraggiamento del nostro pubblico! From that time onwards Sandron's letters become more and more infrequent, and the warm-hearted tone, which had been until then so characteristic of his correspon- dence with Pascoli, is no longer to be perceived. None the less the publisher, disenchanted though he was, continued to present Pascoli punctually every year on his birthday with a cask of Marsala wine, as a souvenir from that Sicily which, he noted, once had been his own too. To my knowledge no copy of the printed Manifesto has survived anywhere, but it can be reconstructed through the evidence existing in Pascoli's Archives (LXXVI, 8, I9-2I and LXXV, 7, 22-24: the last sheet is signed and dated 'Messina/ Maggio del 1902'; a few extracts were published by Vicinelli, Lv, pp. 703-04). The passage regarding Mrs Anderton reads as follows: E si avra per opera d'altri valenti lo Shakespeare; e parra nuovo; ne lui solo, il sommo, ma qualcuno dei grandi suoi predecessori ed emuli, in Italia quasi ignoti, come il Marlowe, il Webster, il Ford. Abbiamo, per quest'opera, la fortuna della collaborazione, e direi quasi del controllo, di Isabella M. Anderton, una inglese di grande dottrina e gusto, che trova nel linguaggio delle citta e contadi toscani le parole nate per rendere i pensieri del suo terribile autore. This passage illustrates once more Pascoli's propensity for borrowing material from the most unexpected sources. In the present instance he draws on his own private correspondence, using Pavolini's suggestions and Mrs Anderton's letter of 8 Febru- ary 1902- a passage that Isabella had in her turn derived from an article of her own (that is, A Wedding in the Pistoiese, in Tuscan Folk-lore and Sketches, p. 89). On 9 March I902 the enthusiastic Mrs Anderton is planning the team of Shakespeare translators to be recruited chiefly in the Marzocco circle (Pantini, Garoglio, Orvieto). In a subsequent undated letter she enquires with the greatest tact about the reward they should expect to receive from the publisher. But neither pecuniary considerations nor Isabella's delicate health can be regarded as chiefly responsible for the Shakespeare project's being wrecked. On 4 December I902 Pascoli had a 'meteor-like' stay in Florence,22 delivering the Dante lecture soon to be pii di letterature anglosassoni, finniche, scandinave, ecc. ecc. come del resto fu il mio concetto iniziale'; o October 903: 'Per la Metrica ... aspettiamo: ma i fogli sono ingialliti.' It is known that Regole e saggi di metrica neoclassica, announced as early as 1900 (in Sul limitare), appeared only after Pascoli's death, with the title A Giuseppe Chiarini, in Giovanni Pascoli, Antico sempre nuovo, Scritti vari di argomento latino (Bologna, 925), PP 339-4I6. 2So Pavolini in a letter dated i6 October I903: 'Come Le dissi il giorno che Ella pass6 (come una meteora!) da Firenze'. Diego Garoglio also alludes to the same occasion on I May 1903: 'infine per chiederti che cosa volevi o scrivermi o dirmi in quel giorno - se te ne ricordi ancora, fra tanto lavorio editoriale abbastanza assorbente' (Archives xxxv, 23, I).</page><page sequence="9">MAURIZIO PERUGI published by Muglia in a pamphlet entitled In Or San Michele, and inscribed 'A una donna gentile | la quale mi guardava molto pietosamente': that is Emma Corcos, one of the few in the audience who listened with somie approval to Pascoli's unsuccessful performance.23 No doubt the failure of the Shakespeare enterprise is one reason for Pascoli's resulting aversion to the Marzocco circle, and more generally to the Florentine cultural environment, where his lecture had been so unfavourably received and reviewed. Emma Corcos was not the only admirer to give Pascoli private encouragement after this bitter disappointment. In a letter preserved in the Archives (xxxvI, 2) and dated 'Lungarno Acciaiuoli 2/Firenze/December 8th I902' a certain Emily M. Hunting asks Pascoli whether he is to publish the lecture given 'last Thursday' (that is just four days before), confessing himself'so deeply interested in the wonder of the straight-growing trees of the Forest, and of the life that shoots ever upwards'. On the blank sheet facing the letter Pascoli has jotted down the Italian for three English words: 'profondamente', 'diretto', and 'germoglia sempre su', and on the verso has written (perhaps for inclusion in his answer) the most famous of all Keats's lines: 'A thing of beauty is ajoi [sic] for ever/Keats'. Soon after Mrs Anderton's death Laura Orvieto wrote the following letter to Maria Pascoli: Cara Sibylla, Le scrivo, al solito, per domandarle un favore. Forse ella non sa che la signora Anderton e morta in questi giorni a Firenze, dopo aver molto sofferto. Ora c'e qui il fratello, che vorrebbe riunire in un volume gli scritti da lei lasciati. A noi una volta la signora Anderton aveva parlato di traduzioni di poesie di suo fratello. Non sa se abbia poi continuato il lavoro? e se abbia pubblicato le traduzioni e dove? Le sarei molto grata di una risposta, e vorrei che mi scrivesse subito perche il fratello riparte fra pochi giorni. Perdoni e grazie: e saluti al grande fratello. Laura Orvieto (XL, 7, 74; undated) The article 'Giovanni Pascoli', included in the volume Tuscan Folk-Lore and Sketches, contains several translations from Pascoli's poems, the last of which being The Sleep of Odysseus, probably hinted at in the first of Mrs Anderton's surviving letters. This text, from the lexical point of view, has much in common with the selection of English terms which Pascoli recorded in the margins of an Oxford edition of Homer's Odyssey I discovered some years ago on the book-shelf devoted to classical studies just behind one of his three writing-desks. It can be safely assumed that Pascoli drew up this list with the specific purpose of providing a model for his own ideal poetic vocabulary, to be constructed on the basis of the linguistic theories of Spencer and Miiller. I have pointed out elsewhere (see note 8) that the quintessence of this vocabulary was ultimately extracted and transliterated in the glossary appended to the second edition of Canti di Castel- vecchio. Here I must content myself with conjecturing that Pascoli would arrange his list of Greek-English word-for-word correspondences, having recourse to The Sleep of Odysseus as well as possibly to other versions by Mrs Anderton (which, to judge from several hints in the extant letters, he would have had at his disposal for a sufficiently long while). Such a procedure would surely be in keeping with the 23 See Giovanni Pascoli, Lettere alla gentile ignota, edited by Claudio Marabini (Milan, 1972). 59</page><page sequence="10">6o Pascoli, Shelley, and Isabella Anderton kind of collaboration Pascoli required both from Briganti and from Mrs Anderton; from her he mostly asked for literal translations 'to be used as dictionaries'. The 'libricino di Shelley' mentioned by Mrs Anderton in her letter of 5 January 1900 is The Lyrics and Minor Poems of Percy Bysshe Shelley, selected, with a prefatory notice, by Joseph Skipsey (London, [undated]). The copy to be found in Pascoli's library is dedicated 'Isabella M. Anderton hopes that you will find pleasure where she has found it. 25. 2.99'. The scanty marks left on some pages by Pascoli's pencil provide adequate, if limited, evidence of a careful and methodical reading. At the time of receiving this gift, he was freshly acquainted with Sully's Etudes sur I'enfance,24 from which he had been collecting a copious and detailed repertory of metaphoric- metonymic processes peculiar to the psyche of children, and suitable, he thought, for being extrapolated into thefanciullino theory. In this framework of reference Shelley functions as an occasional, though most appropriate, touchstone: his poems are chiefly taken as a rhetorical inventory (of course, with special reference to 'oratoria ingenua') ofoxymora, antitheses, and other figures of speech that Pascoli singles out as raw material from which to build his aesthetic theory. Much the same can be said of the far more closely-examined Dante, whose works just at that time Pascoli was scrutinizing in order to detect the 'cervi volanti', the 'lapilli ideali', surfacing here and there like pearls in a current of the sea, where pebbles and dross are also floating past in profusion. In just such a manner the marks made in the margins of Shelley's book, far from pointing to a haphazard selection of passages, are, on the contrary, all consistent with a preconceived aesthetic viewpoint. So one may account for Pascoli's way of reading Shelley, which is entirely unique and owes nothing to the enormous vogue that Shelley enjoyed in Italy at the close of the nineteenth century.25 With the notable exception of two marginal notes, Pascoli's pencil-marks on the pages of Shelley's Lyrics are not more than vertical lines drawn in the margin at the side of the passages to which special attention is called. Leaving aside Skipsey's 'Prefatory Notice',26 the first marked passage from Shelley's text is Alastor: Like restless serpents clothed In rainbow and in fire, the parasites, Starred with ten thousand blossoms, flow around The grey trunks; and, as gamesome infants' eyes, 24 As I have attempted to demonstrate in 'James Sully e le formazione dell'estetica pascoliana', in Studi di filologia italiana, 42 (1984), 225-309 (hereafterJS). 25 Shelley owed his popularity in Italy in the first instance to the critical activity of Nencioni and Chiarini, which was to exert a decisive influence upon Carducci and the Convivio circle (D'Annunzio included). Carducci wrote a prefatory note to the Prometeo liberato translated (1894) by Ettore Sanfelice, whose versions of I Cenci and Poemetti had appeared two years earlier. Pascoli himself was acquainted with Sanfelice; a 'lectura Dantis' of his is praised in a footnote to La mirabile visione (see Giovanni Pascoli, Opere, Milan and Naples, 1981, p. I607). Adolfo De Bosis is generally acknowledged as Shelley's greatest translator in Italy; a copy of his Inno alla bellezza intellettuale (Rome, 1899) is preserved in Pascoli's library with a warm-hearted dedication ('A Giovanni Pascoli, teneramente, Adolfo de Bosis'), but later translations from Shelley (as well as from other English Romantic poets) are to be found there too, by Roberto Ascoli (1905), Taddeo Wiel (1906), Carlo Faccioli (1907), and Luigi Siciliani (I9I I). 26 Where a double vertical line is drawn in the margin on page 17 against a remark which would strike evident responsive chords in Pascoli: I do not think that Shelley was guilty of any wilful wrong, but the gravity of the errors he committed in his marriage, of, and then separation from, Harriet, leading as they did to the most tragic consequences, were such as to smite his sensitive being to the centre .... His 'sweetest songs' at all times were those which told of'saddest thoughts'.</page><page sequence="11">MAURIZIO PERUGI With gentle meanings and most innocent wiles, Fold their beams round the hearts of those that love, These twine their tendrils with the wedded boughs, Uniting their close union. (1. 438) Apart from such typical key-words as 'starred' ('stellanti') and 'tendrils' ('vignuolo', occurring in Dante and in the Garfagnana dialect as well), Pascoli's main interest lies in the simile between parasites and infants' eyes, so far as can bejudged from the following passages. The first is Lines Written among the Euganean Hills, lines 94-95 ('Underneath Day's azure eyes I Ocean's nursling, Venice lies'); in the right-hand margin (p. I I7) Pascoli has written a line of John Milton as a parallel to Shelley's couplet: 'Beneath the opening eyelids of the morn. Lycidas'.27 The other passage is the opening stanza of A Summer-Evening Churchyard: The wind has swept from the wide atmosphere Each vapour that obscured the sunset's ray; And pallid Evening twines its beaming hair In duskier braids around the languid eyes of Day: Silence and Twilight, unbeloved of men, Creep hand in hand from yon obscurest glen. (p.62) As Pascoli had learnt from Sully's Etudes, to think of flowers, daylight, and the like as being provided with eyes, or with human features in a broad sense, is a metaphorical process most characteristic of children's appreciation of reality. Nevertheless 'the languid eyes of Day' were not, in this stanza, the main object of Pascoli's attention, as can be inferred from the word 'Alastor' written on the left no doubt a cross-reference to another passage from Alastor: One darkest glen Sends from its woods of musk-rose, twined with jasmine, A soul-dissolving odour, to invite To some more lovely mystery. Through the dell, Silence and Twilight here, twin-sisters, keep Their noonday watch, and sail among the shades, Like vaporous shapes half seen. (1. 45) As in the stanza just quoted above, Silence-and-Twilight's sisterhood is outlined against a dissolving background of mysterious vapours - and one cannot help recollecting the lines 'il fiore ha come un mielejche inebria l'aria; un suo vapor che bagna | l'anima d'un oblio dolce e crudele' (11. 19-21) from Digitale purpurea, composed and published nearly two years before Mrs Anderton's gift; but Pascoli might well have obtained knowledge of Alastor somewhere else, either in the original or translated. The cross-reference mark at the right-hand side of Julian and Maddalo, lines 23-24 (p. 78: 'the blue heavens were bare, Stripped to their depths by the awakening north') is surely to be connected with line 15 of Ode to the West Wind. Indeed, the whole terzetto, to which this line belongs (p. I I 7), is flanked by a pencil-mark - not surprisingly, in view of the fact that Shelley's Ode exerted a far more significant 27 See (in Pascoli's library) The Poems of John Milton (London, 190 ) and The Poetical Works ofJohn Milton, edited by H. C. Beaching (Oxford, I906). It is interesting to note that both read Under (1. 26) instead of Beneath. This would seem to indicate that Pascoli quoted the line from memory.</page><page sequence="12">Pascoli, Shelley, and Isabella Anderton influence on Pascoli's poetry than is generally acknowledged by Mario Praz and later critics. To limit consideration to the Ode's first section, it may be noted that the opening image of the 'leaves dead' is one of Pascoli's favourite themes, and that lines 3 and 5 may be aptly parallelled with Scalpitio, lines 7-1o, and Foglie morte, line I I.28 It would also be tempting to compare lines 5-8 with an allegorical passage from La mirabile visione xxIV.29 And it will finally be recalled that lines 9-Io contain two outstanding examples of children's anthropomorphism as described in Sully's Etudes: the former ('Thine azure sister of the Spring') is in keeping with certain metaphors to which, as I havejust demonstrated, Pascoli calls special attention; the latter ('shall blow | Her clarion o'er the dreaming earth') is consonant with a childish metaphor which Pascoli quotes from the same Sully in one of the lectures delivered at the University of Bologna.30 On the basis of four more pencil-marks, all to be found in the margins of Adonais (referring to lines 73-77, 89-90, 96-99, 227-29), it is evident that Pascoli, in tracking down these pearls of'oratoria', ran the risk of becoming ensnared by precisely that sort of artificial imagery which, in his own view, was to be condemned as rhetorical diction, a snare in which thefanciullino is at every moment liable to be caught. The last visible mark in Skipsey's edition is a double line drawn on the right of From the Arabic: An Imitation: Ah! fleeter far than fleetest storm or steed, Or the death they bear, The heart which tender thought clothes like a dove With the wings of care (1. 9; P. 285) Once more Pascoli's selection ranges within the sphere of a pseudo-childish anthropomorphism: like a dove's wings are the pains of a suffering heart, which is represented in consequence as being as swift as the cavalla stoma, the grey mare who could feel the hurricane travelling at her side; like violent storms were the stories that the West Wind blew into the ears of his offspring, the prophetic horse of Achilles. This brief survey of the marginalia found in Skipsey's edition of Shelley should dispel any residual doubt about Pascoli's actual command of the English language at its loftiest literary level. Yet before leaving the subject, it is worth recording a detail that will prove not devoid of significance, however trivial it might appear at first sight. While inspecting the copy of Shelley's Lyrics preserved at Castelvecchio, my attention was caught by a strip of blue paper serving as rough book-mark. There are many strips of that kind to be found inserted in Pascoli's books: the difference in this case was that it was so folded in half as to be astride pages I4 --42 corresponding to The Witch of Atlas, Stanzas xxx-xxxvii. Thus I had the very exciting sensation (which I was to know several more times during the periods spent exploring Pascoli's library) that my touch on something was the first since the poet's death. 28 See Scalpitio, 11. 7-1o: 'qualche ombra d'uccello smarrito, I che scivola simile a strale: I non altro. Essi fuggono via I da qualche remoto sfacelo'; Foglie morte (from Canti di Castelvecchio) i: 'Volano come uccelli'. Both originate from a common matrix to be identified with ':qpe3ovto', corresponding to to flee in the Greek-English glossary to the Odyssey (xxII, 299), the suitors fleeing away from the aegis of Athene. 29 See, too, Le armi (from Primi Poemetti), 11. 226-27 'ed il marrello seppellisce il seme, I che nasce e poi... si riseminera'. It will be recalled that 'corpse' (Ode, 1. 8) is 'morticino' in Pascoli's version of Time Long Past (Sul limitare, p. 464, 1. 15). 30 'Questa notte era il giorno natalizio di Dio e il vento aveva avuto in regalo dal vecchio nonno una tromba e lui ci soffiava dentro' (seeJS, p. 304). 62</page><page sequence="13">MAURIZIO PERUGI 63 Be that as it may, the strip of blue paper was there to remind me that Skipsey's selection is the only edition of Shelley's lyrics in the original text to be found in Pascoli's library,31 so it was natural to conclude that it was from this very book that Pascoli took the quotation from Shelley to be inserted in his note to Italy: 'Quanto alle rime con Italy, mi difenda, se accade, Shelley che rima, per esempio, she con poesy e die con purity (The Witch of Atlas; 26, 36)'. But alongside the overt mention of Shelley (quoted by Pascolijust for the purpose ofsubstaining his own technical expertise in rhyming Italy with lui, tossi, and die) a hint of Shakespeare is also to be perceived in some of the English fragments skilfully woven into this expanded poemetto. In the Archives at Castelvecchio there are a great many loose sheets, mostly to be found in drawers labelled as miscellaneous, which contain material relating to the most varied subjects and to every period ofPascoli's poetic activity. Such is the case with LXXIX, I, 246, a scrap of squared paper where Pascoli, according to the 'rhapsodic' technique so peculiar to his own way of making poetry, has stitched together two passages from Shakespeare in the original text: La Poesia della morte e nella morte Hamlet v i PAROLE DEL PRIEST We should profane the service of the dead, To sing a requiem and such rest to her As to peace-parted souls. E IL FRATELLO Lay her i' the earth; And from her fair and unpolluted fiesh May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest, A ministering angel shall my sister be, When thou liest howling... AMLETO What! the fair Ophelia? LA REGINA Sweets to the sweet: farewell! King Lear v iii And my poor fool is hang'd! No! No! No! Life.32 Why should a dog a horse a rat have life And thou no breath at all? Thou'lt come no more, Never never never never never! Pray you, undo this button: thank you, Sir. Do you see this? Look on her, look, her lips, Look there, look there ... Pascoli makes reference to King Lear twice at least: at the beginning of'A Giuseppe Chiarini' and in a short note serving as a memorandum for his lecture course at Bologna.33 Whatever may have been the purpose of the present excerpts from 31 As for Shelley's dramatic works, I have found in Pascoli's library Prometheus Unbound, edited by G. Lowes Dickinson (London, i898), inscribed: 'L. E. Marshall March, I906, riverente offre Novembre I907'. Lily E. Marshall was a regular contributor to II Marzocco; see the copious list of her articles (on Swinburne, Milton, Poe, and so forth) in II Marzocco (Firenze i896-i932) Indici, 2 vols, edited by Clementina Rotondi (Firenze, I980), I. This Prometheus Unbound contains three pencil-marks calling special attention to i, 632-33 (p. 33) 'Thy words are like a cloud of winged snakes; [And yet I pity those they torture not'; ii, iv, I 8-20 (p. 68) 'What to bid speak I Fate, Time, Occasion, Chance, and Change? To these | All things are subject but eternal Love'; n1, v, 39-41 (p. 73) 'yet all love is sweet, I Given or returned. Common as light is love, I And its familiar voice wearies not ever' respectively. In the first and third passage each line is underscored. For I, 632 compare 'serpe alato' in Fior d'acanto (Myricae) 1. 3, while 'clouds' and 'words' are connected at a metonymic level in Gli emigranti nella luna (Nuovi Poemetti) I, 63-66. 32 The correct punctuation is 'No life', as can be read in Pascoli's copy of The Complete Works of William Shakespeare, edited by W.J. Craig (Oxford, I907), p. I020; nevertheless it is tempting to imagine that Pascoli would interpret 'No! No! No! Vivi!' (Live!) - obviously for his own sake, and in spite of the true grammatical meaning. 33 SeeJS, p. 287 (LXXVI, 6, I9): 'vive il rospo, il verme. Cordelia e morta!'</page><page sequence="14">Pascoli, Shelley, and Isabella Anderton Shakespeare, one is tempted to bring into association with them two significant passages of Italy: 'Ioe, what means nieva? Never? Never? Never?' (I, Io3),34 and 'Sweet.... Sweet.... Ho inteso quel lor dolce gridoldalle tue labbra... Sweet, uscendo fuori, I e sweet sweet sweet, nel ritornare al nido' (II, 64-66; see also II, 79, 219). No doubt the death of Cordelia and Ophelia, lying in the background as this foglio appears to suggest, lend substance to the close relation existing between Molly's recovery and her grandmother's death. It will be recalled that Molly stands for Isabella Caproni, Zi Meo's grandchild, who was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, and whom her parents brought to Italy in 1903 with the hope of letting her recover her health. Pascoli himself did as much as he could for her, even approaching the eminent physician Professor Ceci at Pisa, but he could secure for Molly only a fictitious recovery in Italy, Canto ii, and a regretful inscription on her gravestone in the lonely cemetery of Caprona. She passed away in the night between 8 and 9 January: that is, about one year after the death of Mrs Anderton, the elder Isabella who had played so significant a part in helping Pascoli make his way through English poetry and poetic diction. On 13 February 1906 a certain Mrs Sybil Wood Brown writes from Florence declaring herself a Scottish friend of the late Isabella Anderton, and asking Pascoli for an answer in his own hand. The first letter is in Italian; the one which followed is written in English: i6 Corso Regina Elena Florence gth February 1906 Dear Signor Pascoli, How very kind of you to write me that post card, it has given me such pleasure! I fear we Anglo-Saxons are a very unimaginative race, and have left it to an Italian to find out that the swallows say 'Sweet!' I am sure you have been the first to make this 'scoperta', as in Great Britain we always think that the swallows say 'tweet, tweet' - but your idea is, I think, much the prettier .... I shall always think of you when I hear the swallows! I have taken the liberty of writing in English this time, as I know you understand it, and I cannot write well in Italian. (XXXVI, 28, 2) 'Sweet', say the swallows (to imitate Mrs Brown's alliteration very much after Pascoli's manner) even though they forebode a new death, just six years after the 'rondinella nata in oltremare' had been laid in the grave, as in her nest beyond the sea. The last of Mrs Brown's letters is dated 'I2 Febbraio I912' and reaches Pascoli lying in his sick-bed: 34 The word order used by Pascoli in the drafts (LI, 13) is impossible in English: 'O Ioe, what does mean nieva? never? never?'. The published version conforms to poetic usage and permits the repetition once more of never, in closer accordance with Shakespeare's rhetorical pattern. Much more remains to be said about Italy, especially with regard to the English and Italo-American sequences skilfully worked into the poem from end to end, but lack of space precludes a detailed discussion for the time being. Yet I must say here that Pascoli's command of English in the drafts of Italy is so refined that he can make puns on the typical pronunciation of English words by the emigrants from Lucca. So, for instance, Bai miciss- Buy my chits- Buy much ease are three mutually-interchangeable ways of recording the 'phonetic' transcription of Buy images. Similarly son of (a) bitch undergoes the following changes: son of bitsch, sanababicci, and sohn of beach, where bitsch and sohn are German graphemes apparently used by Pascoli to stress to himself the differences between spelling and pronunciation. 64</page><page sequence="15">MAURIZIO PERUGI 65 Ella certo non si ricordera di me, ma tre o quattr'anni fa Le scrisssi chiedendo la Sua firma, ed Ella molto gentilmente mi mando non soltanto la firma ma tutta una letterina in cui mi parlava del dolce linguaggio delle rondinelle.
