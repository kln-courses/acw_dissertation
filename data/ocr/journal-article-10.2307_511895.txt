<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Art of Drama. By RONALD PEACOCK. Pp. vi+264. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1957- 25s. net. Aesthetics has generally been, in the past, the product of the colonizing ambi- tions of the large philosophic empires, empires primarily metaphysical and mostly idealist. Although Professor Peacock disclaims such systematic intentions, what he presents is a general aesthetics, the colony, but without the empire to support it. His primary aim is the familiar desire of the aesthetician to discover behind ll the forms of art the unum necessarium. Rejecting the word 'symbol' as too narrow (even in Langer's usage!) he proceeds to define art in terms of 'imagery'. The exposition of this key concept suffers rather from the author's haste to get to the heart of his subject and one really needs the help of Sartre's The Psychology of Imagination. Quite distinct psychologically from the object of perception, the image is a relation between consciousness and an 'unreal' object. In art it is provided with a material analogue, but the image, which is the 'work of art', remains mental. Mr. Peacock deals with three sorts of image: the 'scientific</page><page sequence="2">432 REVIEWS copy-image' which is denotative and non-artistic; the 'representational image' partly denotative, partly expressive; the expressive formula-image, a vocabulary of signs without literal significance as in music, or an arbitrary use of objects as signs of emotion. 'Art is experience re-enacted as idea, a formula of imagery, or imagery-within-language, being the instrument of re-enactment' (p. 67). This 're-enactment' is presumably what Sartre calls a material analogue. Thus though the arts differ in the media of their imagery, their unity consists not only in sharing this common principle but in the fact that the image itself is idea, thought (PP. 74, 8i, I52). When, in the last third of the book, Mr. Peacock comes to grips with his titular subject, drama is then examined in terms of its characteristic 'intertexture' of imagery. 'Persons', gesture, speech, decor, plot, are treated as a fusion of the representational and the expressive formula-image. Cocteau's poesie de thedtre provides a useful model to confirm his terms. These last ninety pages are so sensible and so full of discernment that one regrets the 'preoccupation with fundamentals' which detains the author so long. Most interesting is his argument that since the medium of drama is 'persons acting' the representative element has to be strong, the abstract and symbolic being generally unsatisfactory. Drama 'is the anthropomorphic form par excel- lence'; 'Its natural themes are psychology and morals' (pp. I8o, I81). This is a plausible position especially when it is made within no narrow realist frame, though, of course, the forms of oriental drama would seem to cast doubt on it. What is puzzling, however, is whether this really means that drama tells us more of life. In terms of his system the representational image, though it incorporates more of real life, incorporates it as structure and therefore need not tell or assert any more of life than the expressive formula-image. He is plainly attracted by the moral and psychological subject-matter, yet it is part of the medium and in the end the medium is slighted: '.. . to the artist it is everything, and yet it is but an instrument of the imagination' (p. 152). Art is 'idea'. The strange gleams of Croceanism here are not, however, Croce at all, but Sartrean psychologism. There is a somewhat banal sense in which an aesthetic experience may be said to be 'thought', but not what it is an experience of. This banality is not entirely Mr. Peacock's meaning, but it seems needlessly confusing to insist on a distinction between a mental 'object' and a real object which makes no difference to the way we talk about them. The most suspect part of his whole argument, however, concerns the unity of the arts. The evidence he is prepared to accept for such unity is itself specious and unconvincing-for example, the statement that poetry can 'approach the condition of music'. 'By virtue of a principle common to them all we can say of a poem: this is poetry, this is art, this is a kind of music; or of a piece of music, it is art, it is a kind of poetry .. .' (pp. 151-2). This is surely a blindness to the metaphoric mode in which such (thoroughly silly) expressions are used. Again in the interests of unity, the semantic confusions of Dichtung are brought in to 'broaden' the notion of the 'poetic' which is then associated with ' "art" alto- gether' (p. 217). 'Poetry' then becomes an honorific term associated with pro- fundity, morality, and insight. Even verse has improbable moral connotations: 'The play in verse .. however much violent action it retains . .. contains prin-</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 433 cipally an inner drama of feeling and motive in morally and spiritually sensitive persons and develops it in an elaborate and subtle language' (p. 22z5). It is difficult not to feel that this whole manoeuvre, basing itself on an essen- tialist interpretation of the word 'Art', is based on a fallacy. What the opening argument in the first paragraph of the Introduction succeeds in bringing out of its logical thicket is that a class of things (Arts) shares a common essence through- out its members. This is an instance of the belief that, as Ryle puts it, 'all the MacTavishes in the world must belong to the family of MacTavishes who live next door'. What we may have is a number of features occurring in different sets, as Wittgenstein's short instructive paragraph on games suggests. Moreover, even if it is possible to discover or impose a single principle throughout the entire class, the similarities thus exhibited are inevitably in terms either of such triviality or such high generality that they are simply not operable. Thus while Mr. Pea- cock's thesis seems to offer a wider and more general concern with the dramatic components than, for example, Wilson Knight's 'expanded metaphor', when it comes to talking about a play there is no question that, despite its verbal monism, Knight's formulation is a good deal more useful-more, in fact, gets said. And in the end, in all fruitful discussions of the arts it is not similarities but differences one really has to talk about. JOHN A. M. RILLIE</page></plain_text>
