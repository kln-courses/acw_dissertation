<plain_text><page sequence="1">COLONIALISM AND PLACE CREATION IN MARS PATHFINDER MEDIA COVERAGE JASON N. DITTMER ABSTRACT. This paper addresses the representation of the planet Mars during the 1997 Mars Pathfinder mission through a content analysis of major U.S. newspapers as well as transcripts of television and radio news shows. Content analysis identified three threads of representa- tion: scientific advance and the search for life, the naming of Martian places, and the Earth analogy. Together these converge in a language of colonialism that both advances the eco- nomic goals of the media and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and repre- sents Mars as a space fit for human colonization. This article focuses on how the Sojourner rover technology simulated human activity on the surface of Mars and led to the constitu- tion of Mars as a place of social activity, thereby enabling the language of colonialism. Key- words: colonialism, Mars, media, place creation, space exploration. The Earth's invading Mars next week, and we aren't talking about science fiction but about science fact. -Joie Chen, 1997 Events within the past decade have enabled a tremendous expansion of the geo- graphical realm. Unremarked on by any human geographers-except for one pass- ing reference (DeFilippis and Smith 1997, 505), the amount of material territory that can be described geographically has nearly doubled with the successful landing of human-scaled explorers on the surface of Mars.' In this article I outline the pro- cess by which Mars has become constituted as a place within the sphere of human activity, beginning with a history of scientific interest in Mars and culminating in the 1997 media event that is my primary concern: the successful Mars Pathfinder mission. I demonstrate that media coverage constructed Mars as a place to be colo- nized, largely as a result of the coincidence of the economic interests of the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the mass media, em- bodied in their anthropomorphic treatment of the Sojourner rover. In 1997 NASA launched the first successful mission to Mars that involved a rover capable of moving about the surface and making observations, known as Mars Path- finder. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), a federally funded research center at the California Institute of Technology, managed the project on behalf of NASA. The purpose of Pathfinder's mission, officially, was to ground truth some of the abun- dant remote sensing data that had been gathered from Earth as well as from satel- lite-based platforms. Unofficially, the mission received authorization to provide a public relations boost to the beleaguered government agency (Markley 2005). On both counts, the mission proved incredibly successful, with NASA reaping reams of scientific data as well as tremendous amounts of public interest via an effective mar- DR.

Given that the Pathfinder mission provided the first new images of the surface of Mars in a generation, and also given the restructuring of the news media over the past ten years to include twenty-four-hour news coverage, coverage of the Pathfinder mis- sion was tremendous. The features of the mission, especially the rover that could follow orders to go to new places, interact with the environment, and send images back, enabled commentators and other viewers to anthropomorphize the machines that NASA had landed on the surface of Mars and understand this heretofore non- existent experience through well-understood language of colonialism. TOWARD AN INTERPLANETARY GEOGRAPHY It may seem to be the height of hubris to claim that geography has some claim on the huge, hulking, objectively "real" planet of Mars, hurtling through the skies and visible at night. Nevertheless, it is helpful to think of Mars less as a planet, with all of the scientific baggage that the term carries, and more as a world, full of the hopes, fears, and ideologies imposed on it from our huge, hulking, objectively "real" Earth. In this way, Mars can be conceptualized as a place, perhaps with unique character- istics not found in any Earth-bound place but nevertheless socially constructed. With human activity routinely taking place beyond the frame of traditional geogra- phy-one need only think of the continually manned International Space Station-the idea of places as areas within the scale of Earth appears increasingly limiting. Al- though it is physically isolated from the human world, technological advancement has made Mars an extension of the realm in which human activity and signification can take place (Giddens 1984). Thus, even though it may seem at first glance to be beyond the realm of geographical thought, Mars is in fact a useful space in which to study the process of place creation, which can be more complex in earthspace be- cause of the need to incorporate local residents' views-not an issue on Mars, so far. Indeed, it is particularly useful as a comparison with other, more earthly, historical interventions by outsiders in which local knowledge was not deemed relevant. In this way, the twenty-first-century exploration of Mars is a useful analogue for place creation in seventeenth-century America and nineteenth-century Africa. Place creation, as a top-down process imposed on a place like Mars, devoid of localized structures of feeling (Williams 1977), "points to those features of nature, culture, and people that are used in the discourses and classifications of science, politics, cultural activism, regional marketing, governance and political or religious regionalization to distinguish one region from others. These classifications are al- ways acts of power performed in order to delimit, name and symbolize space and groups of people" (Paasi 200oo3, 478). Pathfinder's expedition to Mars should be seen, then, from this perspective: Earth-bound observers would use the scientific data to fix in place the classification of Mars, especially in relation to Earth. This is not entirely innocent: Homi Bhabha points to a contradiction of colonialism; namely, that the place and people to be colonized need to be similar enough to be assimi-</page><page sequence="3">114 THE GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW lable but different enough to warrant the violation of sovereignty (1994). Thus, com- paring one place or people with another has historically presaged material conse- quences, as analogies and classifications carry the power to shape social reality. Fraser MacDonald reminds us that visions like those from Pathfinder necessar- ily carry perspective with them; he concerns himself with "what it means to see and how geopolitical power is exercised through the experience of sights and spectacles" (2006, 55). Indeed, visualization of place is a key component of the exercise of power. This is relevant to Pathfinder in two ways. First, as many scholars have noted, the power to map and name is key to colonization. In his 1999 study of Hawaiian to- ponymy, Douglas Herman highlighted the importance of colonizers' ability to pro- duce order and meaning through language in a way that also speaks to Pathfinder's trip to Mars: The Age of Exploration can be understood as a phallic project to cover the globe with order, to subject other lands and peoples to names and categories, hierarchies and schema, of European design. The exploration vessel..,. is the dispenser of logos, spreading order everywhere it goes through naming, classifying, mapping, organiz- ing new places into the discursive constructions of European thought, bringing those places into the European discursive realm, and when deemed necessary, physically beating them into submission. (pp. 78-79) Like those European expeditions to Hawaii described by Herman-and previous U.S. colonizations such as that of the Philippines (Tuason 1999)-the Pathfinder mission constructed a geography of Mars at various scales. Even without indigenous names to uproot, the act of naming and mapping is still political in that it is an exercise in political power by NASA, a distinctly American governmental institution. The second way in which the visual was key to the exercise of place creation appears in the images sent home by the Pathfinder lander and the Sojourner rover, which played critical roles in simulating these events-and landscapes-located mil- lions of kilometers away while empowering both NASA and the mass media. It was the experience of the amazing new panoramic landscape photographs (Figure 1) that initially demonstrated human activity to the spectators at home and constructed Mars as a stage of human action, a place within the overall framework of human geography. NASA and the mass media fostered the preferred classification of Mars. NASA provided several weeks of breathtaking images and a story that reminded several generations of the science fiction they had grown up on. The mass media provided an audience for NASA to amaze, an audience that, presumably, would pres- sure its representatives to more adequately fund NASA. Together, NASA and the mass media established the meaning and classification of Mars, in part to maximize their economic and political standing (Markley 2005). As Maria Lane brilliantly illustrates, in the late 1800s certain charismatic ama- teur astronomers and popular magazines had a relationship similar to 1997's coali- tion of NASA and the mass media (2005, 2006), with the result that a popular conceptualization of Mars as covered in canals emerged despite significant scien- tific opposition. This vision of an arid Mars modified to sustain life in the face of</page><page sequence="4">MARS PATHFINDER MEDIA COVERAGE 115 increasing ecological disaster influenced the efforts of science-fiction writers (Ray Bradbury, for example) and Hollywood films (such as Total Recall and Red Planet) to provide imaginary geographies of life on Mars in the later twentieth century (Kitchin and Kneale 2002). These works of science fiction provided space for fanta- sizing about human interaction with Mars, often conceptualizing Mars as an escape valve for human population pressure or as a proxy for Earth in environmental morality tales. However, what was missing in these fictional geo-graphs of Mars was a crucial element for place creation so distant that humans have yet to go in person: the changing visual perspective that comes with simulated human activity and movement in the Martian environment. Using my definition of place creation, Mars was not the first extraterrestrial site of place creation; Denis Cosgrove has documented the moon's long-standing role FIG. 1--The panoramic view from the Pathfinder lander-an arena of simulated human activity. Note the Sojourner rover in the middle distance. (Image reproduced courtesy of NASA/JPL-Caltech) in human activity and imagination (1994, 2001). However, although Mars Viking 1 and Viking 2, both launched in 1975, provided pictures that amazed the world in their time, they were limited by their static nature-a twentieth-century version of what Joan Schwartz referred to as a "nineteenth-century geographical endeavor" in that NASA sought to establish veracity through "photographic verisimilitude and mechanical reproducibility" (1996,17). Rather, Pathfinder represents the postmodern focus on simulation, as expressed in the work of Jean Baudrillard (1994, 2000). He argued that the "real" has been eclipsed by the "hyperreal," inasmuch as simula- tion, or virtuality is seen as proxy for-or even as preferable to-engagement with "reality:' The collapse of distance implicit in Baudrillard's claim (for example, why go to the Eiffel Tower when you can take a virtual tour of it?) is apparent in the Pathfinder mission to Mars. Indeed, the vast numbers of people watching Path- finder on television or following it on the Web site-half a billion hits by the end of the mission (Bergreen 2000, 77-78)-and following Sojourner's movement across the Martian surface via updated images represent participation in the simulated event on an immense scale (Figure 2). Through this virtual exploration of Mars, the planet has become a virtual appendage of Earthspace, no longer Other but rather a human place where anyone can explore; see, for instance, Google Mars, a Web- based GIS of the surface of Mars (Google 2007), MARS PAST NASA presented the Pathfinder mission to the public as the apex of centuries of human imagination and desire to know Mars more intimately. Ever since Galileo</page><page sequence="5">116 THE GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW FIG. 2-This view of the Pathfinder lander from the Sojourner rover is one example of how human mobility was simulated on Mars. (Image reproduced courtesy of NASA/JPL-Caltech) discovered that other planets in the solar system were round and appeared Earth- like, speculation has focused on the possibility of a society on these planets parallel to our own. Given the progress of scientific technology after Galileo's time, several centuries went by before observers could make conclusions about the surface of Mars. By 1830 astronomers knew some of the basics, including that Mars had polar ice caps-assumed to be similar to Earth's-and that the Martian day was roughly the same as that of Earth. These discoveries further encouraged astronomers to see Earth in Mars, so they began to map it as they had the Earth. Giovanni Schiaparelli, an Italian astronomer, created a systematic grid for the task of mapping, and, by the time he finished, he had placed 3o4 place-names on his maps. Published in 1877, the maps sparked great interest (Morton 2002). Over time the detail of his maps and his use of classical Mediterranean names, such as "Libya," "Hesperia," and "Elysium," left his system of nomenclature the dominant one. This dominance occurred quite controversially at the expense of the older, less detailed maps, on which Martian places were named after professional astronomers who jealously guarded their Martian legacies. Schiaparelli's own legacy, however, was much more difficult to erase. His perception of linear features on the surface of Mars fed the public's fantasies of not being alone in the solar system, and a disciple of Schiaparelli's work, Percival Lowell, popularized this interpretation of the maps (Lowell 1896; see also Sheehan 1996). Although these "canals" were sketched more definitively in Schiaparelli's map than were ever observed through a telescope, Lowell's claim that they were built by Martians to provide irrigation on a dry planet became popular both in literature and later in film. Given that few members of the</page><page sequence="6">MARS PATHFINDER MEDIA COVERAGE 117 public had access to the telescopes needed to see Mars in the mid-189os but that many readers had access to Schiaparelli's maps, it should not be surprising that the existence and "Martianthropogenic" nature of the canals became accepted knowl- edge, at least among the general populace. Just as was true for many of the terrestrial expeditions of the day, then, prestige inhered to putting things on the map, not taking them off. Once a credible astrono- mer had mapped the canals, it was nearly impossible to erase them. Those who claimed to see a canal-free landscape on Mars did not even bother to produce or publish maps, as the reduction of detail was not considered a contribution of any impor- tance. Astronomical maps thus functioned like the geographical maps of the day.... The blending of the authority of map and maker explains how the infamous- nonexistent-"Kong Mountains" could have appeared on commercial maps of West Africa for over a hundred years. (Lane 2005, 490) During this period Mars observers often envisioned the planet as having a geogra- phy; indeed, these intellectual contests can be seen as being about the nature of that geography. Although some scientific observations had been made, this geography was innately a product of the geographical imagination (Gregory 1993). The explosion of effort in space exploration during the 1960s provided a more empirical way of describing Mars, but one that subsequently stripped many of the romantic notions from it. Mariner 4 began to unveil the face of Mars in 1965, but in a way that makes today's Martian rovers seem all the more like science fiction in our own time. The images sent back were 200 x 200 pixels, with only sixty-four grada- tions of color available for each (Morton 2002). These images were an improve- ment over many previous attempts to remotely sense the surface of Mars, but not by much. Later missions, such as Mariner 6, Mariner 7, and Mariner 9, gathered images that were of high enough quality to be used to find landing sites for the later Viking probes. All of these missions also demonstrated how very different Mars was from Earth--with very low temperatures, low atmospheric pressures (about 1 per- cent of Earth's), craters covering the surface, and polar ice caps made not of water, such as those of Earth, but of frozen carbon dioxide (Markley 2005). "Mars was simply not what people had thought it to be. Rather than a world to be experienced in the imagination, it was a planet to be measured, a planet in the new space-age meaning of the term, something woven from digital data streams and ruled by the hard science of physics and chemistry" (Morton 2002, 42-43). In geographical terms, Mars had moved from being a place, filled with humanistic notions even if lacking actual humans (or Martians), to being a space: abstract, quantifiable, and devoid of life (Philo 1992). The Viking missions of 1976 were similarly successful in that they sent back a tremendous amount data but vastly different in that they accomplished something never before done--landings on the surface of another planet. Locating landing sites was difficult because the landers used retrorockets to slowly lower themselves onto the surface, thus requiring a flat area on which lander's legs could stand up- right. A single boulder or crater edge could ruin the whole project. The result was</page><page sequence="7">118 THE GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW that the Viking landers touched down in the safest, and consequently most scientifi- cally boring, of Mars's landscapes (Morton 2002). Although the space vehicles trans- mitted high-quality scientific data from the planet's surface, the images reinforced the idea of Mars as a lifeless, abstract space not relatable to the human experience on Earth, particularly with its pink skies, lack of topography, and red rocks and soil (Figure 3). The fantasies of those who saw Mars as either a chance for the human race to start over, the way that the "New World" had been perceived as a fresh start by European civilization, seemed dashed, with the exception of fringe groups who kept the idea alive, particularly by focusing on the coincidental appearance of a phara- onic visage in the region known as "Cydonia" (Brandenburg and Rix Paxson 1999). It was in the context of budget crises, external pressure to do their work "faster, better, cheaper" (McCurdy 2001), and internal pressure to make their work seem relevant to taxpayers in order to shore up declining political support, that NASA scientists conceived Mars Pathfinder. Launched in December 1996, Pathfinder, with its payload of geological instrumentation, rover, and cameras, hurtled toward Mars with none of the old restrictive Viking technology. Instead, it employed air-bag tech- nology to bounce the lander to a stop in a rocky region that geologists suspected indicated an area affected by water in a long-ago time in Martian history. This served a twofold purpose. First, it enabled its rover, named Sojourner after the African American author Sojourner Truth, to sample a variety of rocks that, specialists hy- pothesized, floods transported to the area during floods when Mars had water. Sec- ond, it enabled the cameras on both the lander and the rover to take rich and varied images of the surface of Mars in order to generate public interest, in contrast to the images taken by the Viking landers. Pathfinder was remarkably successful in both endeavors. The lander operated for almost ninety days, and the Sojourner rover operated for slightly fewer days; both lasted many times longer than expected. To- gether they produced almost 17,00ooo images of the surface of Mars and broadcast 2.6 billion bits of information back to scientists on Earth (JPL-Caltech 1997). MARS PRESENT The empirical research in this article consists of content analysis of newspaper ar- ticles and television and radio news transcripts related to Mars Pathfinder found in the LexisNexis database. The newspaper articles come from major U.S. newspapers and span a twenty-nine-month period, 20 February 1996 to 21 July 1998; the tran- scripts range over a slightly shorter period, 8 August 1996 to 21 July 1998. These dates refer to the first articles and broadcasts with Pathfinder content and the last articles and broadcasts detailing the mission's end or effects. Though not inclusive of every newspaper or news broadcast covering the Pathfinder mission, the data- base nevertheless serves as a powerful lens through which to view the aggregate media representation of Martian geographies. Geographers have used qualitative content analysis to study controversial po- litical topics and the ways in which geographies are constructed through newspaper coverage (Myers, Klak, and Koehl 1996; Dittmer 2005; Larsen and Brock 2005). I</page><page sequence="8">MARS PATHFINDER MEDIA COVERAGE 119 FIG. 3-The surface of Mars as seen from the Viking 2 lander in 1976. (Image reproduced courtesy of NASA/JPL-Caltech) went farther by incorporating television and radio news transcripts. The twenty- four-hour cable news channels are a dominant feature of the contemporary media- scape, and any media analysis must take them into account. I read the articles and transcripts with an eye for common terms and themes, which I identified with codes. I then categorized the codes on the basis of similar features or common strategies. For instance, a quotation describing Ares Vallis as having been formed by a flood of biblical proportions that provided scientists with hope of discovering proof of microbial life, would coded "Place-name - Ares Vallis,' "Possibility of life," "Comparison to Earth-Biblical flood," and "Past existence of water." All such codes were aggregated into categories such as "Place-names," "Sci- entific Discourse," and "Comparisons to Earth." What follows is a description of the colonial language found throughout the media coverage. Quotations from the media studied exemplify broader trends and are not exhaustive catalogs of the rep- resentation. Cosgrove pointed to space exploration as an extension of the "American sense of planetary imperial mission .... Imperial expansion [after the Apollo space pro- gram] was to be directed peacefully beyond the Earth for the benefit of 'all man- kind' rather than into the territories of other human cultures" (1994, 281). Indeed,</page><page sequence="9">120 THE GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW the newspaper, television, and radio coverage of Pathfinder harnessed a powerful language of colonialism that manifested itself in three specific ways in their effort to portray the mission in an exciting light: scientific advance and the search for life, construction of Martian toponymy, and the Earth analogy. The first of the rhetorical threads is perhaps the most obvious: The scientific community constructed Mars as an object to be studied using accepted methods and deliberate efforts. This is congruent with the imposition of order apparent in the colonial language of the Age of Exploration that Herman described (1999). Given the official reason for the Pathfinder mission and the regular access provided to scientific personnel by NASA, it is not surprising that the descriptive language of science should permeate the media coverage. Even before the Pathfinder lander FIG. 4-Mars at sunset, showing refraction of the dust in the sky. (Image reproduced courtesy of NASA/JPL-Caltech) bounced onto the surface of Mars, scientists were conducting interviews to explain the scientific context of the mission and the location chosen for the mission for the landing. Space-agency specialists laid out the current theories of Mars's origin in understandable, jargon-free terminology so that readers/viewers could understand the role that the mission would play in advancing science. This was a sticking point for the Pathfinder mission planners, however, for the question most interesting to the public and to policymakers was whether there had ever been life on Mars, and Pathfinder was ill equipped to make such a determination. The question of life on Mars has dominated terrestrial thinkers and science- fiction writers for centuries. It was particularly salient when NASA launched the Pathfinder mission because a meteorite (Allan Hills 84001, thought to be a fragment of Mars blasted into space by an asteroid impact) found in Antarctica had been tentatively identified by scientists as containing evidence of bacteria. Unfortunately, the "faster, better, cheaper" policy under which Pathfinder was conducted precluded the use of expensive biochemical equipment: Pathfinder was designed primarily as a geological mission to demonstrate that a barebones approach to planetary exploration would work, yet NASA's public rela- tions team nonetheless justified the mission in the ambitious rhetoric of exobiologi- cal discovery.... The longest section of the [Pathfinder] Press Kit... is entitled "The Search for Life," and, significantly, its ten paragraphs do not mention the Pathfinder mission. (Markley 2005, 310-311)</page><page sequence="10">MARS PATHFINDER MEDIA COVERAGE 121 Thus, Pathfinder was not designed to answer the questions that were most captivat- ing to the public at large. However, that did not stop the media (following the lead of the Pathfinder Press Kit [NASA 1997]) from focusing on Pathfinder as a key part of the search for life in outer space. Hence, early newspaper coverage of the mission (even prior to Pathfinder's land- ing on Mars) laid the groundwork for scientists' belief that there may once have been life on Mars, albeit a very different Mars than what exists today: "A renewed hunt for life on Mars, especially microbes, is to begin later this year. Driving the exploration are recent findings that early Mars was hotter and wetter than previ- ously believed and that microbes love such environments" (Broad 1996). Once Path- finder landed, television/radio news coverage joined in the speculation: I have no idea. It certainly is plausible that there could have been life on Mars be- cause we know that three or four billion years ago, about the same time that life was forming on Earth, Mars was a warmer, wetter, friendlier place. And if it was, maybe life started in both places at the same time. But when Mars lost all its atmosphere and became very cold, it's not clear whether if life started on Mars it would have been able to sustain itself. (CNN 1996) In this way Mars was established for the public as a place with two major eras in its history, an early, Earth-like phase and the current, seemingly dead phase. Scientists and reporters then began to describe the former phase in terms of Mars's current geology, climate, and topography. The geological equipment on Pathfinder was used to make conclusions about the potential for life: "The Mars Pathfinder has yielded the strongest evidence yet that Mars, like Earth, has a crust, a mantle and an iron core, scientists said today. The finding lends support to the theory that Mars might have once been hospitable to life" (AP 1997). Other reporters highlighted the possibility that water was locked up in geological formations about io kilometers beneath the surface of Mars and that that groundwater might be key to life on Mars: "These hidden residents of Mars are envisioned not as large and complex organisms but as tiny specks of life smaller than a pinprick that flourish deep underground in the wet and more tem- perate regions of the planet's hot interior" (Broad 1996). The media portrayed the Martian climate and atmosphere in clear contrast to that of Earth. In particular, they described the dust that fills the atmosphere as some- thing alien, creating "spectacular sunrises and sunsets" (Sawyer 1997c) and the skies that remain bright up to two hours after sunset because the light refracts back down from the highly reflective dust in the sky (Figure 4). These descriptions allowed view- ers/readers/listeners to simulate their own existence on the surface of Mars through their imagination. Furthermore, media coverage inscribed alienness through descrip- tors of the climate: "There's the cold climate when Mars is far from the sun, and much of the planet is covered by huge cirrus clouds, with temperatures at the polar regions 200 degrees below zero; and there's the hot climate, when Mars is closest to the sun, and temperatures average 80 degrees warmer. Much of the surface is a dusty</page><page sequence="11">122 THE GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW desert, unlike anything on Earth" (cBs 1997a). These vast changes in temperature come from a lack of atmosphere and oceans that "buffer changes in temperature" and also from Mars's "egg-shaped path" around the sun (Sawyer 1997a). The aspects of the Martian surface that received the most attention were the indications of an ancient flood that shaped the landscape. The attention paid to this is clearly because of the linkage in most scientists' minds between the presence of water and the possibility of life. Indeed, the location of Pathfinder's mission was chosen as one of several sites that, from space, appeared to be an "ancient flood plain" (Broad 1996).2 The official reason for selection of this site was to provide more rocks for analysis-because the flood would have carried there from other parts of the Martian surface-but unofficially the choice allowed NASA to produce visual evidence of flood-impacted, potentially life-sustaining landscapes with which to woo the public. The potential landing sites for Pathfinder included Ares Vallis-the eventual choice-and Parana Vallis, both of which showed evidence of having been impacted by tremendous floods (Figure 5). "Ares Vallis is a 'grab bag' location with a huge variety of rocks in a small area, according to project scientist Matthew Golombek of JPL. It is located at the mouth of a large outflow channel where rocks and soil would have been washed down from the Martian highlands at a time billions of years ago when flood waters moved over the planet's surface" (Sawyer 1996). The role of Pathfinder in this valley was to look for evidence that the Ares Vallis flood hypoth- esis was true (in opposition to other hypotheses, such as volcanic origin). In this way the geological tools of Pathfinder could be applied to the question of life be- yond earth, albeit by falsifying other hypotheses. A new generation of youthful sci- entists who, like most of the audience, hoped to find evidence of life on Mars, ran the project and seemingly abandoned the ideal of dispassionate scientists. "Scien- tists were delighted to learn that there is a hill, about a third of a mile high, just southwest of the landing site, that they believe was carved, like an island in a stream, by a catastrophic flood on Mars billions of years ago" (Boyd 1997a). Through all of these hypotheses and descriptions, media coverage represents Mars as a place that is purely the result of physical processes and is understandable by scientific methods. In total, however, this language of scientific description largely serves the interests of NASA and the news media through its focus on the possibility of life on Mars. For instance, reports gave scant attention to the many other aspects of Mars not related to the possibility of life. The originators of the representa- tion-NASA-and its mediators-the newspapers, television news channels, and so forth-linked their product with existing rhetorics of life on Mars that originated in the world of science fiction and in Lowell and other early marketers of Martian enterprise. Mars fit into NASA'S and the news media's economic interests as an in- centive for more viewers-and therefore more funding-and representations of Mars reflected that fit. Referring to the romantic Mediterranean nomenclature put into use on Mars by Schiaparelli, Lowell argued that "Naming a thing is man's nearest approach to creat-</page><page sequence="12">MARS PATHFINDER MEDIA COVERAGE 123 ing it" (1896, 141). Just as Schiaparelli's place-names created a world out of the planet Mars for those "in the know" in the 1870s, the Pathfinder mission allowed some of those place-names to be entered into the everyday lexicon of the millions of readers and viewers participating in the experience through the media. Literally, the news coverage of Pathfinder led to the construction of these places in geographical imagi- nations all across the United States-and beyond. Of course, only a few places received the lion's share of description or airtime. Nevertheless, this act of naming is an act of power, claiming Mar- tian space as part of the human realm, and it is the second rhetorical thread associated with co- lonial representation in the Pathfinder coverage. The best-described place was obviously Ares Vallis, the aforementioned site of the Pathfinder landing. Ares Vallis is located in a world with few relational landmarks available to render its lo- cation knowable to the reader or viewer. One way in which this was accomplished was to relate its location to one of the only two human land- marks on Mars: "The site on Ares Vallis is a rocky plain at the mouth of a wide channel cutting through ancient highlands. It lies 525 miles southeast of a place where Viking 1 landed in the plain known as Chryse Planitia" (Wilford 1997a). This, somewhat humorously, assumes that read- ers have some conception of where Chryse Plani- tia is. To be fair, understanding Martian geogra- phy is complicated by the lack of water, which prevents the landmass from being broken up into convenient cognitive regions. Alternatively, Ares Vallis is also located at "19 degrees north of the Martian equator," which is perhaps easier to imagine (Boyd 1997a). Other locations the media described include Cydonia, a Pathfinder landing site preferred by conspiracy theorists because of the "face on Mars" geological structure found there that has led some to argue that Cydonia holds "the monuments and ruins of an ancient civilization" (Harmon 1997). Other, more gen- erally accepted, geological phenomena helped two locations emerge from the map of Mars among the heavy coverage of Ares Vallis because of their enormous size in comparison to Earth's features. Valles Marineris "is one of the deepest canyons [on Mars]. It's 3,000 miles long, 60 miles wide" (CNN 1997e) and can be found just south FIG. 5-A portion of Ares Vallis, pho- tographed by the 2ool Mars Odyssey or- biter, showing streamlined islands formed by flood erosion.

News accounts etched other, smaller, places on Mars into the public's conscious- ness, often places that were within Ares Vallis. For example, NASA staff commemo- rated the late astronomer and Mars booster Carl Sagan by renaming the Pathfinder lander the "Carl Sagan Memorial Station" (Wilford 1997b). This attempt to com- memorate through the act of place-naming is simply an extension of the politics of naming found here on Earth. Often, though, humor masked the politics of naming: "NASA's sense of humor seems intact with these very scientific monikers. There is 'the big crater.' Down the road apiece, there, you see the 'Far Knob' and the even more remote 'Really Far Knob'" (CNN 1997i). The Twin Peaks, two hills about a</page><page sequence="14">MARS PATHFINDER MEDIA COVERAGE 125 kilometer from the Pathfinder landing site, was presumably named after the televi- sion show popular in the early 1990s. The act of naming decreased in scale to microgeographies around the Path- finder lander because the Sojourner rover had no ground clearance and had to be very careful about running aground on a rock. Moreover, because geologists were very interested in the types of rocks in Ares Vallis, they named each individual rock in the immediate vicinity of the lander (Figure 6). As before, humor masked the power of the act of naming, for the rocks received names seemingly through stream of consciousness on the part of the scientists: "The names may appear 'silly and childish' said Henry Moore, a dignified retired geologist who is on the Mars rover team. 'But we work very hard, and it helps us keep our sense of humor' " (Boyd 1997b). Scientists supplied names based on cartoons (Stimpy, Bamm-Bamm, Scooby Doo, Pooh Bear), shapes (Wedge, Half Dome), and literary/cinematic characters (Indiana Jones, Zaphod). The two most discussed were the two large rocks closest to the Pathfinder lander, Barnacle Bill and Yogi. Each rock received attention from the scientists because of its physical attributes: Barnacle Bill is-appropriately-cov- ered in small bumps, and Yogi is unusually shaped-not surprisingly-like a bear. The power of naming may seem wasted by the scientists in their choice of humor- ous, popular culture-oriented names for the microgeography of Pathfinder. Rather, the humorous names kept the media attention focused on a rock field longer than could have been expected otherwise: "With Cooper and his colleagues at the'wheel, the adventures of Sojourner are really just beginning, as it sets out to visit the 'rock stars' of Ares Vallis. Then it will be up to Barnacle Bill, Yogi, Scooby Doo, Casper, Squid, Hedgehog, Shark, Flat-Top, Couch, Souffle, Platypus, Boo Boo and others to sing their songs of ancient Mars for the waiting audience on Earth" (Sawyer 1997b). The third rhetorical thread of colonial language used by NASA and the media to connect with their audiences was one that attempted to establish an understanding of Mars based on reference points on Earth. Like historical colonizers, NASA scien- tists were compelled to use Earth analogies to explain otherworldly phenomena. This is, as Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno pointed out, part of a modern impulse to make nature conform to our desires ([1944] 2002). For instance, report- ers described the landscape of Ares Vallis as "like the Grand Canyon" (Boyd 1997b), or "kind of like Arizona, New Mexico, something like that" (CNN 1997f), or analo- gized Mars itself to Earth in land area, geological diversity and amount of water (for example, Boyd 1997b). The media and scientists had particular trouble finding analo- gies for the Martian features that are larger than anything on Earth. Biblical terms provided scale for the flood that created Ares Vallis: "With each new color photo- graph from Mars Pathfinder, scientists are recognizing the awesome magnitude of a deluge that swept over much of the red planet billions of years ago, a catastrophe that perhaps only Noah could appreciate" (Wilford 1997c). Other analogies for this event included "all the water in the Great Lakes [flushed] into the Gulf of Mexico in a two-week period" (Wilford 1997a) and "the [flood] that filled the Mediterranean Basin" (cBs 1997b).</page><page sequence="15">126 THE GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW The landscape of Mars is so alien that analogies inevitably resorted to myths or, perhaps, multiplication, as in the case of Ares Vallis: "a canyon so huge that it was capable of carrying one thousand times the flow of the Amazon River" (cNN 1997g). Analogies themselves multiplied through the news coverage: summer temperatures like winter in North Dakota (CNN 1997a), sunsets like those on smoggy days in Los Angeles (CNN 1997h), frozen ground as in the Canadian tundra (CNN 1997C), and salt deposits like those on Mauna Kea (Hoversten 1997). The matter of understand- ing Mars through analogy is more than just a cognitive necessity, for it has unantici- pated outcomes. Once Mars becomes established as something that is knowable, it becomes classifiable and unalien. The process by which classification is seen as a modern impulse that enables domination has been well documented (Bells, Butlin, and Heffernan 1995). The link from this domination to outright human-U.S.-colonization is a per- sistent theme in the media, especially in television and radio coverage. In the spirit of the occasion, quotations harnessing this theme were often grandiose, and dis- patches made explicit connections between Pathfinder and historical explorers: "It's a little bit like the great explorers, Magellan, Vasco da Gama, Columbus, going to search for new worlds" (Moore 1997). Sometimes the tone, as in that quotation, was one of scientific innocence, although clearly innocence was rare among historical explorers. At other times the tone was much more militant: "This independence day, it's the U.S. that invades another planet-Mars" (ABC 1997). In still other times, Manifest Destiny appeared: "Never forget, America's a nation of explorers. I believe that we have exploration written into our genetic code in America. The boundary now is on Mars and the moon and other planets" (NBC 1997a). Similarly, "Explora- tion is the life blood of our civilization. Our civilization is like any living thing. There's a birth period, a growth period, and . . . a death period. There's no better example that we are in the living, thriving phase of our civilization's life than the fact that we are exploring and expanding our boundaries" (CNN 1997b). This con- nection of the Pathfinder mission to earlier, Earth-bound modes of exploration clearly symbolizes the extension of human agency onto the Martian surface. Both NASA spokespeople and reporters specifically commented on the anthropomorphiz- ing of the Pathfinder components; one example is this exchange between host Katie Couric and NASA representative Donna Shirley (NBC 1997b): COURIC: So if we're saying hello to the rover, I guess we should be saying good evening, huh? SHIRLEY: I think so. COURIC: I think it's funny how-how-how we give this robot such human charac- teristics, isn't it? SHIRLEY: Well, she's a very prepossessing little creature. I mean, I'm pretty anthro- pomorphic about her myself. COURIC: I'm glad to hear that.</page><page sequence="16">MARS PATHFINDER MEDIA COVERAGE 127 Geographers have illuminated the linkage between geographical practice (for example, surveying and visualization) and military conquest (Driver 2000, for in- stance), and the analogies of NASA'S simulated human presence to figures like Co- lumbus indicate a perceived relationship between Earth and Mars similar to the historic relationship of Europe and the Americas. Clearly, the colonial quotations above indicate a very different attitude toward Mars than that demonstrated in the previous two rhetorical threads. Nevertheless, the three threads and practices, taken together, intersect in a powerful language of colonialism. LOOKING FORWARD The mass media amplified and conveyed the preferred narrative of NASA to success- fully embed this geography of Mars within larger structures of knowledge among the populace. The construction of Mars as a knowable, measurable region with places on a map similar to places on Earth-however tortured that analogy-is a product of this representation of Mars as a place to be colonized. Pathfinder's simu- lated human presence on Mars enabled the fixing of the planet's identity and char- acteristics. That the scientists, the media, and the public saw Pathfinder as simulation is clear from the articles and transcripts: "It's like a person being there. I feel for the first time as though I were on Mars" (CNN 1997d). Together, this institutionalization of Mars as a place of human activity and the technological capability to create simulations of that human activity on Mars presage preparations for its colonization at some point in the future. Although those preparations are certainly neither a nefarious plot on the part of the news media, who are simply motivated by earthly profit rather than by a desire for galac- tic hegemony, nor a bid by NASA for mercantilist colonies in outer space, the eco- nomic interests that motivate their decisions structure the representation of Mars and produce it as a place that can be colonized rather than as a space beyond hu- man geography. All of this could be dismissed as academic hairsplitting were it not for events in Washington, D.C. and in NASA'S design facilities in Huntsville, Ala- bama (Kluger 2006; Wallace-Wells 2006). President George W. Bush's 200oo4 pledge to send a manned mission to Mars has thus far been funded and is in the design stages. The seeming end of the space-shuttle programhas freed up NASA'S creative teams to design new spacecraft that could take people on the long trip to Mars. It appears that, within a few decades actual, not simulated, humans may walk on the surface of Mars; a significant cognitive step in the drive to that moment occurred in 1997 with the media coverage of Pathfinder and the constitution of Mars as a place of human activity. NOTES 1. Although Mars is much smaller than Earth, with about one-third the surface area, it has no oceans, so its land area is roughly the same as that of Earth. 2. "Ancient flood plain" is a term shared by many of the newspaper journalists covering the Pathfinder mission, probably because the press kit used it to describe Ares Vallis (NASA 1997).</page><page sequence="17">128 THE GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW REFERENCES ABC [American Broadcasting Company]. 1997.
