<plain_text><page sequence="1">John Middleton SOME CATEGORIES OF DUAL CLASSI- FICATION AMONG THE LUGBARA OF UGANDA I Dualistic classifications of the world and society have been re- ported from many peoples, and there is a large body of published material on this topic. It has sometimes been thought that a dualistic classification is merely due to an innate desire or need of human beings to classify the world in which they live in such a way as to produce a sense of neatness and completeness when its members survey it. People classify other people into males and females, and various things and actions are said to belong to or to be associated with the right or with the left, and so on. It has been suggested that this may reflect the organization of the brain into right and left hemispheres or the fact that human beings happen to have two hands or two eyes.1 But if these facts Fieldwork among the Lugbara was carried out between 1949 and 1952 with aid from the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths and the Colonial Social Science Research Council, London. Initial writing up of my research material was made possible by grants from the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Re- search, New York, and from the Coltart Scholarship Fund, Exeter College, Oxford. I am grateful to Dr. J. H. M. Beattie, Professor T. O. Beidelman, Mr. W. R. G. Horton, Dr. P. M. Kaberry, Miss L. Kalinich, Professor C. H. Long, Dr. R. Need- ham, and Professor V. W. Turner for discussing early drafts of this paper. 1 See Robert Hertz, "The Pre-eminence of the Right Hand: A Study in Reli- gious Polarity," Death and the Right Hand, trans.

Social classifications are social facts and need analysis in terms of their functions as social facts. Each classification needs to be seen in its relationship to the remainder of the particular culture of which it is a part; it is of little value merely to list examples of such a widespread phenomenon apart from their cultural contexts. In this paper I give an account of dualistic categories used in various situations by the Lugbara, a people of Uganda, in East Africa. The Lugbara classify various types of persons, things, and activities in opposed, contrasted, or complementary pairs. I first present an outline of the structure of their society, the frame- work in which the classification is used: then I present the various dual categories and their social and ideological implications. These can be understood only by discussion of the symbols and items used. Essentially these categories refer to the distinction between good and evil. Any society must make this distinction and must have some means of expressing it, and also have some means of relating good and evil to social actions and social relations. The Lugbara also use these categories to express relations between men and women which are based upon those of power and of authority-I use "authority" here in the sense of legitimate and recognized power. Power and authority relations are essential to any conception of society and its functioning. Indeed, it is hard to see in what other terms any people can conceive of the struc- ture of their society. In addition, these categories are used by the Lugbara to express relations of social stability and social change. In this paper I build the symbols used into a formal classificatory schema; the Lugbara do this only by implication, each symbol being used to elicit certain associations with other elements of the schema. II The Lugbara are a Sudanic-speaking people of northwestern Uganda and the northeastern Congo, and.number about a quarter of a million. They occupy the watershed between the Nile and the Congo rivers, some four thousand feet above sea level, and are sedentary agriculturalists, keeping some livestock. The country is fertile and watered by both a well-distributed rainfall and many permanent streams, and the density of population in 188</page><page sequence="3">the central areas is as high as two hundred persons per square mile. The basic residential and economic group is a cluster of ele- mentary, compound, and joint families, which I call a "family cluster." It is formed round a core provided by a three- or four- generation patrilineal lineage, the minimal lineage.2 The genea- logically senior man of this lineage is the hereditary head of the family cluster. I refer to him as the "elder"; Lugbara call him 'ba wara ("big man"). He has complete authority, outside trivial domestic situations, over all the members of his family cluster. His authority is sanctioned mainly by the fact that he is regarded as the living representative of the dead members of the lineage and of the wider lineages of which it is a segment. Lineages are segments of subclans, of which there are about sixty. The sub- clan is the localized core of a clan, a dispersed unit comprising all the patrilineal descendants of the clan-founder; the clan- founders were the sons of the two hero-ancestors of the Lugbara people. Elders act as representatives of their lineages and make sacrifices to the dead of the lineage on behalf of their living kin.3 Traditionally there were no chiefs. Although today there are government-appointed chiefs, they play relatively little direct part in the everyday life of the ordinary Lugbara peasant. There were, however, and still are, rainmakers, the senior men of the senior descent lines of subclans; they exercise considerable ritual authority. They also had rudimentary political powers, but today these are of little significance. There are also men of influence, known as "men whose names are known," who may be called to arbitrate at disputes and who are consulted for advice on various matters outside the control of ordinary elders. III The Lugbara believe that the world was created by Spirit, a divine power which stands above and outside men.4 Spirit is omnipotent and timeless; it is beyond the control of men, and its purpose may be known only through particular manifestations of its power or by the intervention of diviners, prophets, and other figures. One of its forms or aspects is known as Adroa or Adronga, 2 Details of this system are given in my The Lugbara of Uganda (New York, 1965) and my "The Political System of the Lugbara of the Nile-Congo Divide," in J. Middleton and D. Tait (eds.), Tribes without Rulers (London, 1958). 3 The cult of the dead is described in my Lugbara Religion (London, 1960). 4 In Lugbara Religion (ibid.) I referred to Spirit as "God"; I now realize that that is a somewhat inappropriate term. 189</page><page sequence="4">Some Categories of Dual Classification often qualified as Adroa 'ba o'bapiri ("Spirit the creator of men"), Adroa 'bua ("Spirit in the sky"), or Adroa onyiru ("good Spirit"). Adroa is linguistically a diminutive form of the substantive term Adro and is regarded as being remote from men, in the sky, in the wind, everywhere and invisible. It is not personalized, and Lugbara say that no one can know whether it has a physical form or not. At the beginning of the world Adroa created a man and a woman, Gborogboro and Meme, They were placed on the earth at a place called Loloi, to the north and outside the Lugbaraland of today. Meme was created pregnant and gave birth to the wild animals of the earth. Later she conceived a boy and a girl after goat's blood had been poured over her legs by her companion Gborogboro. These siblings in turn produced another pair of siblings, and there were several generations of such pairs, who were all ignorant of the obligations of kinship and of marriage. Finally one pair produced two men, Jaki and Dribidu, whom I call the "hero-ancestors." After many wanderings during which they lived by hunting, after many acts of cannibalism of their own children, and after performance of many miracles, Jaki and Dribidu entered Lugbaraland. They impregnated leper women who were already living there, married them, and settled down to farming. By these women they begot the sixty or so founders of Lugbara clans. The descendants of these clan-founders were in their turn the founders of lineages and are at the apex of lineage genealogies. Longer accounts of this corpus of myth have been published elsewhere.5 Here I need say only that the myth has a particular thematic pattern. Before the formation of Lugbara society the various mythical personages (the sibling pairs and the two heroes) are given characteristics which I have called "inverted." They behaved in ways which are the opposite of the ways expected of normal socialized persons in Lugbara society today. They were at first ignorant of sexual intercourse; the blood of Meme's first menstruation was not human blood; they committed incest; they ate their own children; they did not know of kinship or marriage; they were inhuman in appearance; they could perform miraculous acts; they lived by hunting. The concept of "inversion" represents the presocial period (in 5 See my "Some Social Aspects of Lugbara Myth," Africa, XXIV, No. 3 (1954), 189-99; Lugbara Religion, chap. v; "Three Lugbara Myths," in W. White- ley (ed.), A Selection of African Prose (Oxford, 1964), I, 128-34; and Father J. P. Crazzolara, The Lwoo (Verona, 1954), III, 350 ff. 190</page><page sequence="5">our sense of placing mythical events in a time sequence) before there was an ordered society, when there was, instead, a world of social disorder or chaos. It had been created by Spirit, but its human inhabitants were unsocialized, amoral, and "natural." After the advent of the heroes and their begetting sons, order was established, and the ideally unchanging pattern of social life came into being. This was not the work of Spirit directly, but of its creatures. Before was a time of primordial disorder, afterward a time of order; before there was no recognized authority among men, only uncontrolled and divine power; afterward was the recog- nition of properly constituted social and moral authority. A similar pattern may be seen in what we would call spatial terms. At the center of the field of social relations of any partic- ular family cluster are the closely related lineages and neighboring groups of the same subclan affiliation. Beyond that lie various other groups which tend to be characterized by being believed to be sorcerers and magicians. Beyond them, along and over the horizon, are thought to live incestuous cannibals, who are said to walk on their heads and to commit almost unimaginable abominations. In brief, the same thematic pattern emerges in terms of spatial relations as in terms of temporal relations, as we would conceive them. Fairly direct social relations are con- ceived and chartered in terms of genealogy: those beyond are conceived and chartered in terms of myth and inversion. Together the two dimensions represent a total field of morality. This set of notions provides a means of conceiving the develop- ment of settled society, of order springing from disorder, of authority from lack of authority, and of genealogy from myth, in a single schema. Lugbara society is based upon a segmentary lineage system, and relations of authority and social order are validated by genealogies, which are formulations of actual rela- tions of authority. This basic dualism runs through much of Lugbara thought about the nature of society and the world and the relationship of man and divine spirit. It may be represented: Disorder Order Man before and outside society Man in society Myth Genealogy Power Authority Inversion Normality Asocial, amoral Social, moral Incest and cannibalism Kinship and marriage Alien lands Lugbaraland Hunting wild animals Farming, livestock herding 191</page><page sequence="6">Some Categories of Dual Classification The concepts in the two columns are both opposed and comple- mentary. The elements of the right-hand column compose the representation of society within a wider world, a sphere of order within a universe of disorder, and also a development of social man from natural or primeval man. These elements all refer essentially to social and moral relations among people. IV Lugbara conceive of the universe as consisting of three spheres, realms, or levels of existence. In each of them the duality between what I may for the moment continue to refer to as "order" and "disorder" is distinguished. The three spheres are the realm of the surface of the world, the realm of time and space as distinct from the immediate area of a given locality, and the realm of the individual organism. The first realm, the surface of the world, is the place on which men dwell. It is known as oroo. Oroo has a social implication that is lacking in the word nyaku ("earth" or "soil"). Living persons are 'ba oroo dria ("people on the surface of the world"); the dead are 'ba nyakua ("people in the earth"). In the center of the world's surface, for any given person, family, or lineage, are the huts and compounds of the family cluster and the wider groups of which it is a segment. Beyond them are the cultivated fields, first the home fields under more or less permanent tillage and beyond them the outside fields under shifting cultivation. The compound or cluster of compounds is known as aku or 'buru, both of which are used literally to refer to the compound. 'Buru is used also for the home where people live and where the shrines of the dead are placed; and aku can be used for a wider sense of "home" to include the whole settlement and its cultivated fields. Beyond the aku in this latter sense are the bushland and grassland, together known as ase ("grass"). The words are used antithetically. For example, domestic animals are anyakpa akua ("beasts in the home"), while wild animals are anyakpa asea ("beasts in the grass"); men are often referred to as 'ba akua ("persons in the home"), women as 'ba asea ("people in the grass"). The settlement is not only the place of living people. It is also the place of the ancestors of the lineage, who are usually buried in the center of the settlement and for whom shrines are erected in the compounds of their living descendants. The shrines of the 192</page><page sequence="7">dead are the visible foci of lineage perpetuity and lineage autho- rity.6 Whereas the settlement is the domain of men, the grassland beyond is the domain of wild creatures and of Spirit in the aspect known as Adro. Adro is the term of which the diminutive form is Adroa, "Spirit in the sky." Adro is immanent on the surface of the world. Adro lives in streams, in bush and grassland, and on hills and mountains. Whereas Adroa is everywhere "in the wind" and "in the sky," Adro is everywhere on the surface of the world outside the settlements and cultivated fields. But whereas Adroa is formless and unpersonified, Adro is attributed the form of a human being, tall, white in color, and cut in half lengthwise, with one leg, one arm, half a face and head. I have never heard Adro attributed genitalia, and the term agule ("like a man") used for Adro has no definite sexual connotation. It hops about on one leg-Lugbara are unsure whether right or left leg-and can harm, or even kill by eating, any human beings who are so rash as to go into its domain in the evenings or at nighttime. It is not thought to be so harmful in daytime, when it retreats to the hills and bushland. Adro is the inverted being par excellence. It is commonly referred to as Adro onzi ("evil Spirit") and sometimes as Adro 'ba o'dupiri ("Spirit the taker away of men"). With Adro dwell spirits known as adroanzi (literally "spirit children" or "Spirit's children"). They live in places in the bush- land and may take the form of water spirits (yii adro), tree spirits (pati adro), or rock spirits (uni adro). They may all harm people who enter their domain, and it is believed that these spirits may take the form of little men and women at nighttime in order to guard rain groves. Adroanzi are the elements known as adro of dead human beings.7 In the realm of the individual organism there is a distinction made by the Lugbara between an asocial, natural human being and a socialized person. A fully socialized person comprises several elements which separate at death. Besides the body, which after death becomes a corpse, there are certain immaterial elements. There is first the soul (orindi), which is the element that 6 Not all people are buried in their compounds. Lepers and certain other per- sons who die through the sudden and direct intervention of Spirit are tradi- tionally thrown out into the bushland. 7 I have heard it said that Adro, despite its sexlessness, has a wife and the adroanzi are their children. But this belief seems to be unimportant, and I think it was introduced into a discussion by informants for the sake of logical consis- tency and to emphasize the anthropomorphic features of Adro. 193</page><page sequence="8">Some Categories of Dual Classification acts responsibly, especially in kinship relations; after death it leaves the body and goes to the sky, the place of Adroa. Later it is contacted by a diviner and brought down to a shrine placed for it in the compound of a son. It then becomes a ghost (ori) and acts responsibly as protector and guardian of lineage interests and morality. There are also the elements known as adro and tali. Both are closely connected with Spirit. Adro is itself the word for Spirit, and tali is the word used for manifestations of Spirit in the world of men: it is the skill of divination given to a woman by her possession of Spirit, it is used for a place struck by light- ning, and so on. Whereas only men, and adult men at that, are thought certainly to possess a soul, men and women, old and young, all have adro and tali, although their strengths increase during their possessor's lifetime. At death the adro leaves the body and goes into the bushland to become one of the spirits known as adroanzi, which I have already mentioned. The tali stays in the compound and becomes part of the collectivity of lineage tali, for which a special shrine is erected.8 These three elements of a man together comprise a totality which represents his total social personality. The soul is that part of a man concerned with kin and lineage responsibility. The tali is that part of a man which gives him influence over other people, whether related or not; a man with strong personality has a powerful tali. Both soul and tali are "good," in the sense that they behave responsibly; it is therefore logical that after death both should remain associated with a man's descendants, his lineage, and his compound. The adro is rather different. Men are different from animals, and Lugbara sometimes say that men are also different from women and children in having souls, that is, as being socially responsible people. But people are also different from animals in being created directly by Spirit, whereas animals were born by Meme. There is spirit in all living persons, what might be called a "divine spark," something that is separate from man as a purely social being. It is a sign of man as a divinely created being, in the sense that the mythical siblings were divinely created but existed prior to the formation of society by the hero- ancestors. That is the significance of adro. When its possessor dies, adro leaves the body and becomes a spirit of the wild and so again part of Spirit. Unlike the soul and tali it is not associated 8 I have discussed these concepts at greater length in Lugbara Religion. There, however, I used the term "guardian spirit" for adro: I think the simple term "spirit" is better. 194</page><page sequence="9">with a descent line, nor is it associated with any kind of social grouping. It is that element responsible for idiosyncratic behavior, behavior which marks one man out as being distinct from other men. I have translated the words Adro and Adroa as "Spirit." Despite the use of the diminutive, Lugbara do not explicitly dis- tinguish between them except as aspects of the same power. This power links the three spheres or realms I have mentioned: adro that of the individual, Adro that of the surface of the world, and Adroa that of the whole universe. These realms are linked into a single moral system, in which Spirit is in each case in some way both opposed and complementary to other concepts: adro, the divine part of a man, The individual soul, unassociated with lineage associated with lineage relations relations and responsibility Adro, in the bushland The homestead and settlement, away from the settlements, home of lineage members the place of wild animals and domesticated animals Adroa, in the sky, above, The world of men outside and remote from men Since the concepts in the left-hand column are expressed by the single term Adro-Adroa, we might expect those in the right- hand column to be linked also in Lugbara thought. The former concepts have in common that they represent the power of Spirit, which stands outside men living in their petty communities. Spirit created the world ex nihilo, thus creating order from pri- mordial disorder. This relation, between order and disorder, is that which Lugbara express by the use of these opposed concepts. We may now picture this: Disorder Order Outside and lacking social Within social control control Individuals Social persons Women and femaleness Men and maleness Asocial, morally ignorant Socialized genealogical beings mythical beings Bush and uncultivated land Settlements and cultivated fields Wild animals Domestic animals We may now perceive a further factor. I have said that these concepts are opposed and complementary. But they are not true opposites. Disorder is not the true opposite of order but an in- complete form of order, made into order by the action of Spirit. 195</page><page sequence="10">Some Categories of Dual Classification The mythical sibling pairs were incomplete men and women, in a moral sense. They were ignorant of sexual intercourse, an activity which represents the essence of the complementary nature of men and women; they later became social persons by miraculous means, and they then begot and bore their children as do men and women today. They were ignorant of kinship and marriage, an ignorance represented by incest; their incest was in this sense a sign of incompleteness. Uncultivated land is incompletely used land; wild animals are incomplete animals from the point of view of their use to men. The leper women were physically incomplete, lacking fingers and toes, but were made complete by being cured by the heroes. In each case, the distinction is between what we might call natural things and behavior, on the one hand, and social things and behavior, on the other. Lugbara refer to this very distinction when they speak of babies and of clients, people who settle with wealthy patrons. Babies are said to be afa ("things") and to become complete persons after socialization by the society into which they are born. Clients may also be called afa when they first enter a settlement, and they may then even be killed; but later they become persons ('ba) after they are adopted into the settlement and their patron gives them a daughter as a wife. There are two additional points briefly to be mentioned here. One is that the complementarity of the pairs is a necessary one for the continuity of a divinely created and ordered cosmos. Un- cultivated land and its wild animals are as necessary for economic life as is cultivated land with its domesticated animals. Women are necessary for the continuity of the patrilineal lineage, even though this is controlled by men. The other point is that in the myths there are two categories of women: the sibling women and the leper women. The former seem to represent the female princi- ple rather than women as wives. They vanish from the scene when it shifts to Lugbaraland: only the heroes enter there, and their link with the siblings is a weak one (the two myths are rarely told together and are linked only by the existence of the heroes, who feature in both of them). The women of the second myth became wives and mothers at the formation of Lugbara society. V This duality is fundamental to an understanding of the cos- mology of the Lugbara and to their comprehension of their social structure. It provides them with a means of conceiving and giving 196</page><page sequence="11">meaning to their world and the ways in which it, and society within it, came into being. It also provides them with a way of comprehending change in the world and society. Lugbara conceive of their society as ideally unchanging and as unchangeable by the actions of ordinary men. Yet clearly change does occur, and for Lugbara to be able to live in any kind of ordered social life, change must somehow be accommodated in their thought. They are aware that there is always change or development of a regular or repetitive kind, as part of normal social life. This is due to the birth, maturation, and death of men and women; to the cycle of development of family and lineage; and to the evil activities of witches and sorcerers who disrupt the even flow of ordered social life. They are aware, too, of change of a more radical kind, in which the very structure of their society is threatened and may be altered. Regular development can be accommodated without a breakdown of the social structure: the actual pattern of rela- tionships of authority may vary from day to day, but the basic structure of these relations does not. Lugbara myth gives an ex- planation of this pattern. But when the basic structure does alter, then new myths are added to the existing corpus. In this way change can be accepted as part of an ideally unchanging order and the paradox resolved.9 Lugbara conceive of their society as a field of ordered relations in the dimensions of space and time, and also in a moral dimen- sion. They see it as an area of order surrounded by disorder, the latter the domain of asocial and amoral chaos and of unpredict- able power uncontrolled by members of society, whether living or dead. The occurrence of change in this field of order is seen as the entry of this external disorder into the sphere of order. Ex- ternal order may impinge upon, weaken, or threaten ordered relations. In addition, certain persons may leave the sphere of order and enter that of disorder, and others come from the sphere of disorder into the realm of ordinary men, as agents of the power of Spirit. There are, that is to say, certain situations in which Lugbara see confusion between the elements of this cosmological classifica- tion. In the remainder of this paper I shall describe some of them briefly. They are; 1. The possession of a woman by Spirit to make her a diviner 9 I have given an account of the myth of the coming of the first Europeans elsewhere-see n. 5. This myth, which deals with events of the early years of this century that were therefore witnessed by some of my informants, is put by them into the same thematic pattern as the myth of creation. 197</page><page sequence="12">Some Categories of Dual Classification 2. The occurrence of certain sicknesses thought to be sent by Spirit 3. The part played by Spirit at sacrifices to the dead 4. Birth 5. Death 6. The activities of witches and sorcerers 7. The activities of specialist craftsmen and of hunters 8. The appearance of epidemics, droughts, and famines 9. The appearance of Arabs and Europeans at the turn of the century There are other situations, but a discussion of these will suffice. All these situations are associated in Lugbara thought with evil, danger, moral inversion, and to some degree with pollution. The word onzi is used to refer to them, although its use is wider. It means "evil," "bad," "dangerous"; it refers to activities or events which disturb or threaten to disturb the orderly exercise of au- thority, and in particular that of lineage authority. Lineage authority lies at the basis of their social organization. Some societies have as a basic principle of organization the allegiance of subject to king or the submission of man to God. For Lugbara it is the recognition of parental and ancestral authority in the lineage, and the recognition of the duties and respect that this entails. Despite their seemingly near anarchy and fragmentary social organization, the unity and perpetuation of the agnatic lineage are for them the most important goals for the mature and responsible person to achieve. The dualistic classification of things, people, and events into the spheres of order and authority, on the one hand, and disorder and uncontrolled power, on the other, is a crucial one. The two spheres, by their very nature of being complementary, should be kept apart in both thought and experience. Any merging of them is evil and dangerous. Lugbara have fairly explicit notions as to the nature of the persons who are in various ways associated with breaches in the classificatory schema. They regard them as uncanny, dangerous, often specifically evil, and as incomplete beings. The confusion of order and disorder is seen as the confusion of authority (which is moral, responsible, controlled, and predictable) and power (which is amoral, perhaps immoral, irresponsible, uncontrollable, and unpredictable). The people associated with this confusion have in common the characteristic of themselves being incomplete and so representing the essential nature of disorder itself. These people are diviners, prophets, witches, rainmakers, elders in certain situations, and certain women. 198</page><page sequence="13">VI In this section I present, very briefly, an account of those situa- tions in which the moral classification of the universe becomes confused and a description of the roles of the persons associated with this confusion. 1. The possession of diviners.-Diviners are usually women who are possessed by Spirit (Adro) before or at puberty. They are taken by a fit or trance and typically run off into the bushland, often for several days, wandering crazily. They may throw away their apron of leaves and run about naked. Their close kin will watch them and follow them at a distance to protect them from serious physical harm but otherwise leave them alone. On their return they are said to have the mystical power (tali) of divination and healing. Not all women so possessed do in fact practice divin- ation, and those who do go through a form of initiation at the hands of other diviners. But all erect a special shrine, known as Adro jo ("Adro house"), which they place under the eaves of their huts. Women who do divine sometimes start to do so after marriage, but most of them divine only when past the meno- pause. Contact with Spirit thus usually occurs before puberty and after the menopause, when they lack the power of procrea- tion (itself known as adro) and so are said to be "like men" (ekile agule). I believe that those women who divine before the meno- pause are in fact barren, but I am not certain on this point. Diviners transmit their power to their eldest daughters. Diviners tend to be feared; they practice in the semidarkness of their huts, and not outside in public, and are regarded as uncanny and dangerous.10 It would be too strong to say that they are polluting, but certainly they remove pollution in others. There are also male diviners, but I have never met one; they are said usually to be unmarried, and accounts given to me suggest that they may be homosexuals; but this is uncertain. 2. Sickness sent by Spirit.-Disorder may affect the well-being of the individual in the form of certain sicknesses thought to be sent by Spirit. These are not the sicknesses sent by the dead, which are considered specifically to be a consequence of the commission of sins, acts which harm the well-being of the lineage by threatening the accepted distribution of authority within it. Sickness from the dead is followed by sacrifice and purification, 10 This is in contrast to operators of oracles, who are men who practice in day- light and in public and are regarded as "good." 199</page><page sequence="14">Some Categories of Dual Classification both of which are lineage rites and performed by lineage elders.11 Spirit also enters into them to some extent, and I deal with this below. Sickness sent to an individual by Spirit is different. It is be- lieved that, should a person wander into the domain of Spirit (Adro) in the bushland and near streams, away from the settle- ments, particularly in the evening or at night, he may see, touch, kick, or tread upon Spirit or one of the spirits known as adroanzi. He is later sick with sharp pains. This sickness has no moral con- tent as far as lineage authority is concerned. A person who suffers it has shown merely that by his (literal) wandering away from the domain of men into that of Spirit he has shown that he does not accept the proper cosmological boundaries. He goes to a diviner, who treats him by removing the sickness in the physical form of pieces of rock or metal from his body. The victim is regarded as dangerous and tends to be avoided. It would be too much to say that contact with him is polluting, but certainly there is an element of pollution in his condition. This element is quite lacking in the condition of a person made sick by the dead. There are also sicknesses whose symptoms are trembling and shaking, which are sent by spirits called yakan and kalia. These are spirits which come "in the wind" and which are associated with Spirit (Adroa). They are treated by diviners. Again, these are purely individual sicknesses, without moral content.12 3. Spirit and sacrifices made to the dead.-Sacrifice is made to the dead as a consequence of sin, an action committed against lineage authority. In all sacrifices to the dead, Spirit (Adroa) is also concerned, to a greater or lesser degree. The sacrificial animal is consecrated for sacrifice by being led counterclockwise round the sick man's compound, and if it urinates this is taken as a sign of the approval of Spirit. If at the sacrifice itself it rains or the sky grows dark, this is a sign of the disapproval of Spirit, and the rite must be postponed to a later occasion. The sacrificial beast is usually a goat or bull; but in some cases a sheep, a "beast of Spirit," is used instead. These are situations which concern the segmentation of the lineage, and thus the rearrangement of lineage authority, rather than the everyday maintenance of lineage authority. Segmentation occurs typically after the death of an elder rather than after that of an ordinary man, and the 11 The cult of the dead is discussed in detail in Lugbara Religion. 12 See my "The Yakan or Allah Water Cult among the Lugbara," Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, XCIII, No. 1 (1963), 80-108. 200</page><page sequence="15">Lugbara liken it to the creation or re-creation of social units by Spirit. 13 An important sacrifice is made by the elder of the minimal lineage concerned. Before making it he observes certain taboos: he must not have sexual intercourse with his wife the night before, and he must not wash his face and mouth on the morning of the rite. It is said that then his breath will be powerful and also that it is still "like nighttime." When he makes the actual offering to the dead he goes alone to their shrines and places meat, blood, and beer in and on them with his left hand. The right hand is said by Lugbara to be the hand of men, and the left that of women. At these times he stands alone, and other men fear to touch him or even to stand too near him. He is temporarily leaving the realm of men and entering that of Spirit. He marks the duration of this period during the rite by holding certain sacred leaves in his left hand before and after performing the actual oblation; these leaves come from the bushland and are said specifically to be associated with Spirit. 4. Birth.-At birth a new being is created, specifically by Adroa 'ba o'bapiri ("Spirit the creator of men"). A person's soul develops in the course of his lifetime. But it is at birth that the element known as adro enters a person, as a sign of his divine creation: the external power of Spirit enters the realm of the individual. This makes him a creature of Spirit, still to some extent outside the realm of men (and called "thing," afa, as I have mentioned above) until he becomes socialized and a full person. Birth is regarded as dangerous and polluting and is called "evil," onzi. It is marked by taboos. Men are prohibited from entering the compound where the birth is taking place. Midwives include diviners and those women of the household who are past the menopause. The placenta is buried secretly in the bushland by a diviner and is thought to be highly polluting to men. The paths to the compound are closed by placing eggs on them; eggs are associated in Lugbara thought with sterility, in that a woman fears to become sterile by eating them. 5. Death.-Death is caused by Adroa. At death there is a movement, between the spheres of order and disorder, of certain of the elements that compose a man. They are linked during his lifetime and separate at his death. As I have mentioned above, the elements of adro and tali leave the body, which merely 13 The points alluded to here are discussed in detail in chap. iv of Lugbara Religion. 201</page><page sequence="16">Some Categories of Dual Classification becomes a corpse. The soul (orindi) leaves the body and goes to the sky, the realm of Adroa. It remains there while on earth the elaborate mortuary rites are performed, at which the network of relationships of authority formerly centered upon the lineage status of the dead person is reformulated. After the end of the mortuary rites the soul is contacted by a diviner, who summons it to earth and places a shrine for it. It then becomes a ghost (ori), and sacrifices are made to it.14 Death, like birth, is associated with pollution in Lugbara thought. A corpse is highly polluting and should be handled by sisters' sons, men of other lineages, who are afterwards purified. A widow is segregated in a specially built hut and later purified.15 In former days, when feud and warfare were frequent, the corpse of a man killed by enemies was collected by women of his lineage from the bushland where he had been killed. They had to observe taboos, of which the most important is said to have been against sexual intercourse the previous night. 6. The activities of witches and sorcerers.-A further situation of confusion between the spheres is that of the activity of witches. Witches, in Lugbara, are men who possess lineage authority which they pervert for their personal ambitions. They use their mystical power of kinship to harm people against whom they bear a grudge or whom they envy. They turn to the use of anti- social power instead of being content to use their lawful and responsible authority. They are considered "evil" (onzi) and are given the attributes that I have called inverted. They are regarded as incestuous and are associated with night animals; a man thought to be impotent or homosexual is said to behave as a witch does. A man who is sick from witchcraft goes to a diviner, as only diviners can tell the identity of witches. The various kinds of sorcerers believed to exist by Lugbara are similar in certain ways. They are associated with night and night animals, and they harm others for their personal ambi- tion. Some of them are women, and all use magical "medicines." Sorcery sicknesses are thought to be of various kinds, but all are similar in being identifiable and curable only by diviners.16 7. The activities of specialist craftsmen and hunters.-Specialist 14 These rites are described in some detail in chaps. iii and iv of Lugbara Religion. 15 See my "Myth, History and Mourning Taboos in Lugbara," Uganda Journal, XIX, No. 2 (1955), 194-203. 16 For an account of Lugbara witches and sorcerers, see my "Witchcraft and Sorcery in Lugbara," in J. Middleton and E. H. Winter (eds.), Witchcraft and Sorcery in East Africa (London, 1963). 202</page><page sequence="17">craftsmen in Lugbara include blacksmiths and potters, and hunters may be classed with them in this context. They are all part-time specialists only. Smiths are never Lugbara, but are Ndu, a Sudanic-speaking tribe living to the southwest of Lugbara- land, almost all in the Congo. There are families of Ndu smiths scattered across Lugbaraland. They intermarry and are fairly rigidly differentiated from Lugbara in everyday life, although they are not regarded as being inferior. When actually smithing, their hearths are surrounded by taboos, and women, especially men- struating women, must not come too close or the smithing will be unsuccessful. They are able to curse people and fields, and Lug- bara will not willingly approach their compounds at night. They are said specifically to be associated with Spirit (Adroa), as the work they do is considered almost miraculous, their skill being known as tali. Something of the same awe surrounds the Lugbara women who make pots. They are usually past the menopause, and a menstrua- ting woman who enters their compounds may cause the firing to go wrong and the pots to crack. However, their skill is not mystical: it is known as ondua, not tali. The position of hunters is significant. Today hunting is of very minor economic importance in Lugbara, as most of the game has been hunted out. None the less, there is great ritual importance attached to it. The horns of animals caught are placed in or near the shrines under the granaries and are especially associated with those shrines known as drilonzi ("bad luck"). Hunters are men who venture into the realm of Spirit (Adro): before going they may not have sexual intercourse, and on their return they undergo a form of ritual purification by diviners to rid them of the dangers of revenge by the "kin" of the animals they have killed. 8. The appearance of epidemics, droughts, and famines.-Spirit may enter into the affairs of men by the sending of epidemics, drought, famine, and other disasters; they are all sent by Adroa. They affect all members of a community equally and are not regarded as a consequence of sin by its members. The response is for a rainmaker to take a white ram and to lead it round or at least through the territory of his subclan. and then to drive it across a stream into the bushland beyond. I have been told that the ram is thought to go into the mountains, where it becomes a leopard and so becomes rain, or causes rain, in some mysterious manner. Sheep, unlike other animals, are associated in partic- ular with Adroa. 203</page><page sequence="18">Some Categories of Dual Classification Rainmakers are the genealogically senior men of senior line- ages of subclans and have great authority and influence. They are regarded as very different from ordinary men. They are gene- rally both respected and feared, and their rain groves, into which only they may go, are places much feared and said to be protected by the adroanzi. Rainmakers are buried differently from other people; unlike ordinary people, who are buried in daylight, they are buried at nighttime, in silence. It is said that this is because the elements called adro and tali have left them from the time when they began to practice the mystical power (tali) of rain- making, a power given to the clan founders in the remote past by Adroa. They are, as it were, partially dead, already joined with Spirit outside the sphere of social order. They are also closely connected with leopards and are said to become leopards when they die. Leopards, like hyenas, are greatly feared night animals and are closely associated with Spirit. 9. The appearance of Arabs and Europeans.-Spirit has also entered the sphere of order in situations of radical change brought about by outside agents-Europeans and Arabs. Europeans are known as Adro (it is said because they are white and eat people). The end of the last century and the first twenty years of this one were marked both by severe epidemics, particularly meningitis, and by the advent of Europeans. These were considered closely related events, and the response was for the Lugbara to accept the ritual leadership of prophets. The prophets came from the Kakwa, the tribe immediately to the north of the Lugbara. They and their cult, centered on the drinking of magic water, were related in Lugbara thought to the power of Spirit (Adroa). Prophets were the emissaries of Spirit, and today they are remem- bered as personages with mythical attributes which mark them as outside the sphere of social order. The principal prophet, Rembe, is said to have introduced the practice of divination with a divining gourd, which was later taken over by the women diviners. He was regarded as "not a man" and as "like a woman." He left no children (as far as the Lugbara know) and is often said not to have slept with women. He wandered about the bushland as do adolescent girls when possessed by Spirit. He was neither a full man nor a Lugbara, and his exploits are related in mythical terms.17 17 I have given a description of the prophets and their cult in "The Yakan or Allah Water Cult among the Lugbara." 204</page><page sequence="19">VII There are two points to be discussed that arise from the data presented so far. One is the dual classification itself; the other is the nature of the persons I have listed who can move between the spheres of order and disorder. It is useful to draw up a list of paired elements, as they have been presented above. They include (1) things, people, and events; (2) directions and relationships; and (3) abstract concepts. Disorder 1. Women Babies Wild animals Witches and sorcerers Sorceresses Things Spirit Places called tali Prophets and rainmakers Diviners Shrines outside homestead Spirits Individuals Birth Death Incest and cannibalism Leper women Hunters Blacksmiths Pottresses Heroes Clients Europeans, Ndu Menstrual blood Iron ore Raw clay 2. Left Female Bush Sky Loloi, Congo, Sudan Myth Night and darkness Sexual abstinence 3. Evil Amoral, asocial Power Inversion Order Men Adults Domesticated animals Ordinary men Co-wives Persons Soul Ordinary places Elders Oracles Shrines inside homestead Ghosts Persons Life Life Kinship and marriage Wives Farmers Ordinary "amateur" craftsmen Ordinary housewives Ancestors Lineage members Lugbara Ordinary blood Smelted iron Fired clay Right Male Home Earth Lugbaraland Genealogy Daytime and light Sexual intercourse Good Moral, social Authority Normality 205</page><page sequence="20">Some Categories of Dual Classification Disorder Order Immoderation Moderation Stability Change Chaos Cosmos Incompleteness Completeness The items shown under (1) and (2) are those mentioned explicit- ly by Lugbara; those shown under (3) are concepts that I have myself drawn from the Lugbara data, in the sense that the Lug- bara do not have specific terms for them. It is these concepts, of course, that Lugbara are representing by the items listed under (1) and (2). All the items in the left-hand column have certain attributes, opposed and complementary to those in the right-hand column. The opposition is expressed in certain concepts: incom- pleteness becomes complete by man's social action; chaotic and unpredictable power becomes controlled by social action; evil is made into good by social action; and so on. In each case there is a notion of the process of a thing or event being socialized and made moral, good, controllable, predictable, comprehensible. The list does not in fact exhaust the number of antithetical elements in Lugbara thought. There are, for example, the social categories of the groupings known as High People and Low People and those known as Lu and Ma'di, which I have described elsewhere.18 But as far as I know these are not brought into the schema I have described (and I do not assume that this schema is complete). Perhaps they should be; certainly I could force them into it without much difficulty, merely because they are anti- thetical, but I have never heard them associated by Lugbara with the other elements I have listed. This, of course, raises an important problem in the interpretation of symbols-whether or not the observer may use his own interpretation even where the people do not themselves offer it as a valid one. But I shall not discuss this matter here. I am merely presenting certain data which may be of comparative interest. The second problem, that of the persons whom I shall call "liminaries,"19 is one that demands far more space than I can devote to it here. It will be the subject for a later paper. These are people who, either because of certain inherent attributes or because they temporarily acquire certain attributes, are thought to move between the spheres of order and of disorder. These attributes have one thing in common: they are negative. The 18 "Myth, History and Mourning Taboos in Lugbara." 19 The word was suggested to me by Professor V. W. Turner. 206</page><page sequence="21">liminaries take on a characteristic which is the opposite of a main characteristic of their social status. They take on, permanently or temporarily, a characteristic which gives them a "no-status," if the phrase be permitted. By this I mean that essentially they hold a paradoxical or anomalous social status. The obvious exam- ple is that of the diviner: she is either a girl who has not yet menstruated, a woman past the menopause, or a barren woman. She is a female but not a woman. The main statuses in Lugbara society are determined by the three principles of social organiza- tion of sex, descent, and ethnicity. The liminary may be a "no- man" or a "no-woman"; or he stands outside the descent system proper, as does a rainmaker or a prophet without family or chil- dren; or he is a non-Lugbara, as was the prophet Rembe. Sex is used by Lugbara as the most obvious principle of organization in this regard. Since people must be either male or female, it would seem obvious to take sex as the most basic feature. There is not the space here to expand on this important and pervasive theme in Lugbara thought, but it may be pointed out that women act as liminaries in situations of repetitive change, whereas men do so in situations of radical change and at sacrifices, where the act of sacrifice is in certain ways a re-creation of order from disorder. These beliefs and concepts are used in several situations: they have more than one social function in Lugbara culture. They provide both a classification of experience and a way of conceiving change; and they also provide a way of conceiving and accommo- dating the varying ambitions and wishes of individual people. The set of concepts establishes ideal relations between various categories of persons in a single consistent pattern of authority: men and women, adults and babies, living and dead, living people and Spirit, elders and ordinary men, ordinary men and rainmakers, ordinary men and diviners, lineage members and clients and neighbors. It also brings into place the occupations of craftsmen and hunters, cultivators and ritual specialists, and relates the events of birth and death to ordinary life. But more than this is the point that by these concepts and their organization into a classificatory schema the Lugbara can con- ceive of the basic principles of their society (as of any society), the arrangement of patterns of authority and power. They have a model of their social system as one that is ideally unchanging and one that is unchangeable by ordinary human endeavor. Change is seen as involving the incursion of an external disorder, an evil, unpredictable, uncontrollable power. Social change 207</page><page sequence="22">Some Categories of Dual Classification involves change in the patterning and generally in the scale of social relations, which are themselves relations of authority and power. The concepts referred to in this paper symbolize these relations. The concepts that Lugbara call "evil" (onzi), those that have the characteristics of inversion or incompleteness, are either events, places, relations, or persons. The events are those of change; the places are usually outside the compound; the relations are distortions of proper relations between people; the persons are in some way incomplete, either sexually or socially or both. The sexually neutral liminaries are given these attributes because they are dealing with power that is uncontrolled by men. To control it, to drive it away or to canalize it and turn it into legitimate authority, they must themselves become part of it, they must step out of social space and time into spacelessness and timeless- ness. 208</page></plain_text>
