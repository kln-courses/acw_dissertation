<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Ronit Meroz The Archaeology of the Zohar Sifra Ditseniʽuta as a Sample Text1  Introduction The authorship of the Zohar has long been an open and often disputed  question. Opinions are divided between those who believe that it was written  by a single author, and others who see it as the product of multiple authors  who each contributed to what must be recognized as a collaborative work.  Those who argue for a single author fall into one of two groups: some  uphold the tradition whereby the entire work was written in the Land of  1 This study was carried out with the support of the National Fund for Science, grant number  1184-09. I would like to thank No aʽ Dolev-Israeli, Neta  ʽSobol, ʽOded Porat, and Rakefet  Raz who helped prepare the text for publication. I would also like to thank Neta Sobol for  instructive discussions on the subject of this article. Additionally, I owe Ada Rapoport-Albert  an enormous debt of gratitude for her editorial work, which was particularly meticulous  and thoughtful.

As for those who argue for multiple authors – they, too, can be divided  into groups: some attribute the Zohar to several discrete thirteenth-century  authors, some to a coherent thirteenth-century kabbalistic circle (ḥavurah),  while others stipulate multiple groups of thirteenth-century authors, whose  work was subjected to a continuous process of redaction by subsequent  generations of kabbalists. My own position on this question has changed  over time. Originally I subscribed to the view that the Zohar was composed  by multiple authors during the relatively short period from the end of the  thirteenth century to the beginning of the fourteenth. I now believe that  the process of composition was much more protracted, stretching from the  eleventh century to approximately the third decade of the fourteenth.1  The hypothesis that the Zohar is the product of several generations of  authors has a number of implications. First, Moses de Leon can no longer  be considered the single author of the entire work, and the extent of his  contribution becomes open to question. At the same time, his notoriety as  the avaricious forger of the Zohar loses much of its credibility. His own  writings, produced during the 1280s and early 1290s (according to the dates  he appended to the works he acknowledged as his own), alongside the works  of contemporary kabbalists such as Isaac ibn Sahula, help establish what  parts of the Zohar were already available to him and to the kabbalists of  his day.2 Moreover, the multi-generational authorship hypothesis implies that  1 Isaiah Tishby has surveyed the main positions taken on this question up to his own time.  See his The Wisdom of the Zohar, 1:13-96.

This constitutes a major change in our  understanding of the historical development of Kabbalah and indeed of the  history of medieval Judaism in general. It points to a new understanding  of the nature of the Zohar, which should now be viewed as a reservoir of  traditions developed and transmitted by generations of authors, evolving as  a work in much the same way as did the Bible, the Talmud, the Iliad and  the Odyssey, or the Vedas. One of the factors weighing most heavily in favour of this hypothesis is  the discovery of dozens of ostensibly discrete units of zoharic text, which  are, in fact, closely related as adaptations of each other. These adaptations  vary considerably, ranging from linguistic corrections of individual words,  through translations of whole units of text from Hebrew to Aramaic (or  the other way round), to literary enhancements, such as the introduction  of framing narratives, stylistic embellishments, or psychological insights  designed to flesh out the relations among the Zohar’s protagonists. But the  most significant modifications reflect fundamental changes in the underlying  conceptual framework. So many changes could only have occurred over a  long period,3 whose specific duration can be estimated only by resort to  historical rather than literary considerations.4 To account for adopting this hypothesis, I briefly present two examples  of textual units which have undergone a series of such revisions. The first  unit, which I call “The Rose and its Scent,” is now extant in three versions,5  of which the first differs conceptually from the other two inasmuch as it  represents the proto-kabbalistic view, of which only a few other textual  Le’on: mitsvot lo taʽ aseh” (Ph.D. diss., Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1987), 9-12. Lately,  Avishai Bar Asher has identified some more of de Leon’s works; see for example Avishai  Bar Asher, “Sefer ha-Neʿelam, ketaim hadashim mi-Sefer Or Zaruʿa u-verurim beḥiburav  hamukdamim shel Rabi Moshe di Leon: iyun u-mahadurot madaiot,” Tarbiz 83/1-2 (2015):  197-329; id., “Sama’el ve-nekevato: perush Kohelet ha-’avud le-Rabi Moshe di Leon,”  Tarbiz 80/4 (2012): 566-539. 3 Cf. the deliberations of David Halivni on the “stammaitic” stratum of the Talmud (David  Halivni, Mevo’ot limekorot umasorot: iyunim behit’havut hatalmud ( Jerusalem: Magnes Press,  2009), 75-7). 4 For these considerations, see Meroz, Yuvalei zohar, chs. 1-3. 5 The earliest version is printed in the Cremona edition of the Zohar (1559), II, col. 9-10;  the second one – ibid., col. 33. The third and latest version appears in the standard printed  edition of the Zohar II, 20a-b. I published two of the versions, together with an analysis of  the text, in Meroz, “Zoharic Narratives and their Adaptations,” 3-63. All three versions can  also be found, accompanied with a revised analysis, in my book, Yuvalei zohar, unit no. 49. XI Ronit  Meroz </page> <page sequence="4"> traces remain, whereby the antithesis of the quality of Judgement (din) is  the quality of Compassion (raḥamim), and the two qualities are synthesized  and reconciled within the quality of Mercy (ḥesed). The second and third  versions, on the other hand, represent the dominant kabbalistic view, where  the antithesis of the quality of Judgement is the quality of Mercy, and the  two are synthesized within the quality of Compassion. In addition, the  second version expands and enriches the narrative elements, which are very  sparse in the first version. Finally, in the transition from the first version to  the third, the text gradually changes from Hebrew to Aramaic. The second example is the textual unit known as Yisra’el sava, which  exists in three versions.6 The first two concern angels and appear to be  unaware of the standard kabbalistic theosophy of the sefirot. Only in  the third version is the angelology substituted with the familiar sefirotic  structure. In addition, the Hebrew sections are translated into Aramaic,  and the narrative framework is expanded to enhance the growing stature  of Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai. To date, I have studied thirty-two such textual units (of the several dozen  that exist), which are extant in several – between two and five – manuscript  versions,7  all of which can be added to the examples above. In the present  article, I introduce in addition a previously unknown second version of Sifra  ditseniʽuta, which I call “the short version,” and which is quite distinct from  the familiar “long version” published in the printed editions of the Zohar. I  am inclined to the view, albeit tentatively, that there must have been a text  forming the basis of both of the two versions that predated them both. The existence of multiple recensions of zoharic texts calls for a study of  6 In this case, the earliest one is not printed in the known standard editions of the Zohar. One  is printed in Zohar II, 4b, and the latest one is printed ibid., 4a. I present all three versions  of the text in my book Yuvalei zohar, unit no. 6. 7 A significant majority of these textual units is extant in only two versions. Most of them will  appear in my book, Yuvalei zohar, which presents a critical edition of the Zohar on pericope  “Shemot,” and contains (in Appendix 1) a complete list of these units, that refers to the  different sections of the Zohar. Additional textual units of this type appear in Meroz, “Va’ani  lo hayiti sham?!”; ead., “Reqimato shel mitos: diyun bishenei sipurim bazohar,” in Howard  Kreisel (ed.), Limud vada’at bemaḥshavah yehudit 2 (Be’er Sheva: Ben-Gurion University of  the Negev Press, 2006), 167-205. In addition, see the text published in Gershom Scholem,  “Parashah ḥadashah min haMidrash hane’elam shebazohar,” in Saul Lieberman, et al. (eds.),  Sefer hayovel likhevod levi gintsburg limelot lo shivʽim shanah: ḥeleq ivri (New York: American  Academy for Jewish Research, 1946), 425-46, which presents an unknown version of a text  from Midrash hane’elam. See also Moshe Idel, “Qetaʽ lo yaduʽa mimidrash haneʽ elam,” in  Joseph Dan (ed.), Hakenes habeinle’umi letoledot hamistiqah hayehudit, vol. 3: Sefer hazohar  vedoro, Jerusalem Studies in Jewish Thought 8 (1989): 73-88. XII The Archaeology of  the Zohar </page> <page sequence="5"> what I have termed the “archaeology” of the Zohar. It entails the search for  hitherto unknown manuscript versions of texts belonging to the corpus, and  the identification and comparison of apparently discrete textual units which  may turn out to be adaptations of each other or of the same core text. This  can only be achieved through the careful analysis of the conceptual, literary,  and linguistic features that are particular to each textual unit. The results  should make it possible to discern the distinct strata of which the Zohar  is made up, and to shed light on what I believe was its long-drawn-out  process of composition. Sifra Ditseniʽuta The central axis of this work is an intermittent commentary on the first six  chapters of the book of Genesis. It belongs to the “Daniel lore” embedded in  the Zohar, that is, a tradition that employs variations on the terms “Ancient  of Days” and “White Head” drawn from chapter 7 of the Book of Daniel,  which is generally characterised by a tendency to radical anthropomorphism.8 Together with Idra raba and Idra zuta, Sifra ditseniʽuta (henceforth SD)  is considered one of the most difficult, esoteric, and holy sections of the  Zohar. As early as the seventeenth century, Aaron Berechiah of Modena  wrote, “I was afraid to tackle both the Idras and Sifra ditseniʽuta,”9 while  in the opinion of a leading Zohar scholar of our day, “this appears to be  the most difficult composition within the Zohar literature, which is not  only taxing to interpret but also presents the reader with complex textual  problems.”10 These difficulties are at the root of the tradition, which still  persists today, to refrain from translating SD into Hebrew, as is evident,  for example, in Yehuda Edri’s 1998 edition of the Zohar.11 Daniel Matt,  too, in his recent English translation of SD, indirectly paid tribute to this  tradition when he wrote: “The enigmatic Book of Concealment requires  such extensive interpretation that any commentary threatens to overwhelm  the text. Therefore, I have first placed here the text itself, unencumbered by  commentary, followed by the same text with commentary.”12 8 See also Meroz, Yuvalei zohar, introd. 9 See Isaiah Tishby, Ḥiqrei qabalah usheluḥoteiha 1 ( Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1982), 186;  Huss, Kezohar haraqi‛a, 185. 10 Liebes, Torat hayetsirah, 126. 11 Sefer hazohar al ḥamishah ḥumeshei torah, trans. into Hebrew by Yehuda Edri ( Jerusalem:  Yerid Hasefarim, 1998), 5:455-72. 12 The Zohar, ed. Matt, 535. XIII Ronit  Meroz </page> <page sequence="6"> Several problems are bound to confront anyone attempting to decipher  SD. Firstly, the succinct, highly condensed writing does not fully reveal its  intentions to the reader and often fails to follow an idea or an argument  to its conclusion. It appears to present only “chapter headings” rather than  a fully developed exposition. This is exacerbated by the fact that claims  are set out in no particular order, lacking both thematic and interpretative  continuity. These deficiencies should not be attributed solely to the style  of writing, as it is almost certain that parts of the work have been lost,  omitted, or even censored, while many editorial comments have been  inserted into it over time, which are not always consistent with the  intentions of the original author.13 As a result, it is now difficult to retrace  the full textual history of SD, which has a patchwork appearance, with no  evidence of any attempt to conceal the rough stitches that hold it together.  It can be viewed as a proto-text, truncated and yet full of interpolations,  or else as a conglomeration of texts produced gradually, in many stages  and from a variety of perspectives, which inevitably resulted in transitions  from one subject matter to another that are insufficiently clear. Nevertheless, the text is not entirely disjointed, and some of the gaps can be  filled with the help of information gleaned from other kabbalistic sources. The  SD in its extant versions is therefore not devoid of meaning. Like any other text,  it consists of a combination of explicit authorial statements and gaps that must  be filled by the reader. The relative proportions of each are what distinguishes  the fully transparent from the opaque, the perspicuous from the enigmatic. In  the case of SD, the particular blend of explicit statements and gaps, especially  in the long version, places it closer to the enigmatic end of this spectrum. The following discussion focuses primarily on the short version of SD,  although it may well shed some new light on the long version as well.  Occasional references will be made to the long version, but only by way of  background, and without treating it exhaustively in its own right.14 1. The Text 1.1 The two versions, the short and the long, of Sifra Ditseniʽuta The recension of the short version that follows is based on MS Vatican  213,15 pp. 20a-21a, to which I have assigned the siglum ו. The manuscript  13 See section 1.5 for more detail.  14 Unless otherwise stated, all paragraph numbers refer to the short version. 15 Vatican, Biblioteca Apostolica, MS ebr. 213; the microfilm number of this manuscript in the  Institute of Microfilmed Hebrew Manuscripts in The National Library of Israel, Jerusalem,  is 272. XIV The Archaeology of  the Zohar </page> <page sequence="7"> was written in the fourteenth century in a Sephardi script, and it places  SD within Midrash hane’elam on the pericope “Bereshit,” Zohar ḥadash 14c,  between paragraphs 597 and 598 of the Ashlag edition16. In the margins of  the manuscript, variant readings have been imported from two other sources,  both of which locate this version of SD in the same place as the Vatican  manuscript. The first, assigned the siglum א, is another manuscript version:  Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Merton 77 H 22 (microfilm no. 51923), pp.  14b-15a, written in the sixteenth century in a Sephardi-Byzantine script.  The second, assigned the siglum ק, appears in the printed edition of Zohar  ḥadash (Kraków, 1903), 25b-26a. Since this edition is not widely used, the  variant readings it offers have not so far attracted the attention of scholars. After the opening words – ”What is Sifra ditseniʽuta” – the printer of  the Kraków edition has added the following words in parentheses: “This  matter of Sifra ditseniʽuta etc. has already been printed in the pericope  ‘Terumah’ in another version, and because we noticed a difference  between this version and the other one, we decided to print it here  again.” The positioning of this text in the pericope “Bereshit” is to be  expected, as SD is indeed a commentary on this particular pericope.  Moreover, as Tishby has observed, SD was positioned in “Bereshit” in  the Cremona edition of the Zohar as well.17 However, its setting within  Midrash hane’elam requires attention and will be briefly discussed in  section 2.12 below. When noting the variant readings copied into the margins of the  Vatican manuscript, I did not reproduce minor variations between plene  and defective spellings, between the masculine personal pronoun אוה and the  feminine איה, between the presence and absence of the word “etc.” to signal  a truncated biblical quotation, contracted words marked by the abbreviation  sign, or variant spellings of the Tetragrammaton. The long version reproduced here alongside the present edition of the  short version is based on Margaliot’s printed edition of the Zohar (ii.  176a-179a, pericope “Terumah”), to which I have assigned the siglum  מ. Since Daniel Matt has published an edition of this text based on  additional manuscripts, as well as an English translation reflecting the  variant readings these manuscripts preserve,18 I have not attempted to  16 Judah Leib Halevi Ashlag, Sefer ha-Zohar ʽ im targum uve’ur ha-Sulam ( Jerusalem-Tel Aviv:  Ashlag Press, 1955-1963). 17 Sefer ha-Zohar ʽ al ha-Torah (Cremona edn.), 19c-22a. Tishby, The Wisdom of the Zohar, 1:3-4. 18 The Zohar, ed. Matt, 535-88. The eclectic version on which his edition is based, and for which  I supplied him with all the Zohar manuscripts, can be found at &lt;http://www.sup.org/zohar// Aramaic%20Texts/Vol%205%20Aramaic.pdf &gt;, 186-93. XV Ronit  Meroz </page> <page sequence="8"> produce here a critical edition of my own. Moreover, I have reproduced  only those sections of the long version that have their parallel in the short  version, with the exception of a few which are nevertheless integral to the  discussion of the work as a whole. To make it easier for readers to follow  this fragmentary presentation of the long version, and in order to bring  out the full extent of its deviation, in both structure and substance, from  the short version, I have supplied headings that summarize the contents  of all the excluded sections of the long version. Finally, to ease navigation  through this complex text, I have divided it into numbered paragraphs  following the division into paragraphs in the Ashlag edition of the Zohar.  The paragraph numbers appear in square brackets within the text of both  versions, and when referred to in the notes, they are represented by the §  sign. Page references to the Margaliot edition of the long version and to  the MS Vatican 213 short version are supplied in angle brackets (chevrons)  within the Aramaic/Hebrew text.

The translation  of the long version, which is based on Daniel Matt’s, departs from it  whenever my own understanding of the text differs from his. As for the  translation of the short version – whenever it departs from the Vatican  manuscript reading, either to incorporate one of the variants recorded in  its margins or in order to bring it in line with the long version, this is  indicated by an asterisk. .אתיל א [הז םשב :חסונ יפוליח ,טס§ 4 4 XXIV The Archaeology of  the Zohar </page> <page sequence="17"> Short Version (MS Vatican 213) Long Version (Margaliot edition) Opening Narrative Framework ו &gt;20a&gt; [1] What is Sifra ditseniʽuta, the &lt;מ ii, 176a&gt; [1] What is Tseni’uta desifra,  Book of Concealment? Concealment of the Book? Rabbi Shimon said: “There are five  chapters, contained in a great palace and  filling the whole earth. ... So it is for one  who enters and emerges; for one who  does not enter and emerge, it is not so.” [2] [The wheat parable about wisdom] Sifra ditseniʽuta; The Book of Concealment Chapter One [3] These are the chapters45 of the Book [3] It has been taught: the Book of  which is balanced on scales. Concealment, a book balanced on scales. Sifra ditseniʽuta: Chapter One For until there was a balance, they did For until there was a balance, they did  not gaze* face-to-face, and the primordial not gaze face-to-face, and the primordial  kings were dead, and their weapons did kings were dead, and their weapons46 did  not exist, and the earth was desolate. not exist and the earth was desolate.  [4-5] Until the head, the most desired of  all that is desired, arranged and bestowed  [with] garments of glory,47 this balance  hung in a place that was not; weighed  upon it were those who did not exist.  The balance stood48 by itself, it was not  held and it was not seen. Upon it rose,  and upon it rise, those who were not,  those who were, and those who will be.  45 This term might mean chapter headings. 46 For the Aramaic ח-כ-ש (shin-khaf- ḥet) in the sense of “exist” see Michael Sokoloff, A  Dictionary of Jewish Palestinian Aramaic of the Byzantine Period (Ramat Gan: Bar Ilan  University Press, 1990), 550. Comparing this par. to §44, which speaks of copulation, we  may infer that this paragraph uses the term “weapons” in the common euphemistic sense of  semen. 47 These are the enhancements mentioned below – enhancements of the skull and the beard.  This wording probably echoes the verse: “clothe yourself in honor and majesty” ( Job 40:10).  See also section 2.6 below. 48 Stood – the literal translation of the Aramaic text is “stands.” XXV Ronit  Meroz </page> <page sequence="18"> Short Version (MS Vatican 213) Long Version (Margaliot edition) [6] [The seven enhancements of the  Head: skull, hair, eyes, nostrils etc.] [7] “In the beginning [be-reshit] Elohim  [God] created [bara] the heavens and  the earth” [Gen. 1: 1].

According to the text here,  this matter has already been discussed, but the discussion is not extant in either the long or  the short version. It appears therefore that this is a reference to an unknown text, or to an  additional version of SD that is unknown to us. 50 I have translated אתוריקוי differently as “Glory” and “glorious,” in the short and long versions  respectively, because the reference to the Glory appears only in the short version.

This claim has a  distinctly apologetic tone, or from another point of view, it can be seen as a clear declaration  that an innovation is being presented here for the first time. In this respect, SD does not  set out to conceal but rather to reveal secrets which had previously been concealed. See also  §33.

[26-29] [The seven enhancements of the  Small-Faced One’s skull] [30] Scripture says: “I am YHVH, Hu  [literally – that] is my name” [Isa. 42:  8]; “I put to death and I bring to life”  [Deut. 32: 39]; and Scripture says: “I will  bear and I will carry” [Isa. 46: 4]; “Hu  made us and to Him we belong” [Ps.  100: 3]; “Hu is one, and who can turn  Him back?” [ Job 23: 13]. “Hu” − designates one who is concealed  and not found. “Hu” − one who is not visible to the eye. “Hu” − one who is not called by name.56  54 The observation made in this paragraph is based on the parallel structure of the two biblical  words יהיו and רצייו, in both of which the letter yod occurs twice. 55 For rabbinic interpretations of “and he formed,” see e.g. Bereshit rabah 14: 1 (pp. 126-9;  page numbers for Bereshit rabah throughout refer to Midrash Bereshit Rabba, ed. Julius Theodor  and Chanoch Albeck, 3 vols. ( Jerusalem: Shalem, 1996)). 56 This paragraph creates a sophisticated pun. The plain meaning of the Isa. 42:8 is that God’s  name is YHVH, but the Zohar reads it as if YHVH declares that He has yet another name – Hu.  The fact that the Hebrew word hu is a demonstrative pronoun (meaning “that”) is perceived as an  indication of God’s nature, namely, of a being whose essence is withheld from human knowledge.

She surely is “your She surely is “your mother”! “For you  mother”! “For you will call understanding will call understanding ‘mother’” [after  ‘mother’” [after Prov. 2: 3].60 Prov. 2: 3].61 Chapter Three Chapter Three [33-36] [Nine enhancements of the curls  of the Small-Faced One’s beard] [...] All that is [...] treasured away by  Scripture.62  57 The meaning is that the letter א extends (lit. “goes”) into ףלא (alef; the name of the letter א  written out in full), which then continues to extend to דוי (yod; the name of the letter י written out  in full), as discussed in n. 59 below. 58 In the printed editions, the letter yod appears in full as דוי, but from the context it seems that  the abridged form י is the correct one here. 59 The דוי (written out in full) “goes” to י, a concealed letter normally written without the letters  ו and ד (vav and dalet), which complete the word yod. The situation is considered deplorable, because  this letter י should have “illuminated” the letters ו and ד rather than concealing itself and leaving  them “naked” (see §32). 60 The “mother,” who is the “father’s” partner, is mentioned again in §44 below. For more on  this couple, see the discussion in section 2.8 and n. 163 below. The literal meaning of Prov.  2:3 is “if (im) you call for understanding,” but the word im is read as em, namely mother. 61 Cf. §§12, 13; and §23 (which is not included in this table). 62 This means that not only the topic of the Ancient One’s beard but also that of the Small- Faced One’s beard had been concealed and has never been revealed before. See also §14  above.

For  He said, “Let [the waters] swarm”−  intermingle: higher creature, lower  creature; good &lt;מ ii, 178a&gt; creature, evil  creature. [39-43] [“Another interpretation” which  deals with kavanot (contemplation in  prayer)] 63 What is said here is also mentioned in the Idra raba. See Zohar III, 140b (Idra raba). 64 SD is exploiting here the ambiguity of the expression “nefesh ḥayah” in Gen. 1:20, where  ḥayah can be read either as an adjective, yielding the sense of “a living soul,” or as a noun,  yielding the sense of “the soul of a living being,” and in association with the occurrence of  the term in Ezekiel’s vision, it yields the sense of “a living creature.” The same ambiguous  expression is implied again below.

[More about the nature of Adam] 65 The original text actually means “who will be made,” but the past tense makes better sense  in this context. 66 I read the last word, המיא, as a spelling mistake for אמיא/אמא − imma, meaning mother. This  reading makes more sense and would seem to be preferable to the parallel reading in the  long version. For further discussion of this, see below, section 2.8. 67 On Cain as the outcome of the coupling between the serpent and Eve, see Pirqei Rabi Eli’ezer  (ed. David Luria, Jerusalem: n.p., 1990), 21. See also the 13th-century letter attributed to  Rabbi Yehushi’el, where Cain is referred to by the name Shedbeten (belly-demon), because  “the demon’s spirit expands in the vulnerable belly” (Moshe Idel, “Perushim lesod ha‛arayot  bereshit haqabalah,” Kabbalah, 12 (2004): 89-199 150). See further, Zohar 2:101b-102a  (Sava demishpatim), where man is warned not to marry a widow because her first husband  has left his spirit within her, and his spirit writhes in her bowels like a serpent and is liable  to level accusations against the spirit of her new husband.

Syntactically, the short version  links §49 to the preceding paragraph, which focuses on the lower Adam and his resemblance  to the upper Adam. The short version thus tells us that the lower Adam is concealed by  letters and marked by a certain instability inasmuch as nothing higher or lower than him,  be it letters or any other entities, can ever settle within him. The long version, on the other  hand, speaks of the Ancient One and the Small-Faced One rather than the upper and the  lower Adam. Here, the Ancient One is entirely “sealed,” while the “sealing” of the Small- Faced One is only partial, as some of his aspects are revealed. Like the lower Adam, the  Small-Faced One is distinguished by instability: nothing higher or lower than him can ever  settle within him. The letters – to whose dynamic creativity SD generally pays a great deal  of attention, describing them as ever emanating or expanding to generate new beings – are  associated in this paragraph with the lesser of the two supernal entities, namely with the  lower Adam or his counterpart, the Small-Faced One. They are therefore bound to move  on and eventually be revealed, even if for the time being they remain concealed. Thus they  are similarly described as being unstable – incapable of ever settling down.

Ishmael –  “general and particular” (see Sifra 1: 1). It is because of this logical link between beast and  man that the animal soul, too, is included in Adam (see §51). 70 Nefesh ḥayah is inserted here on the basis of the long version, after the model of behemah  mentioned in §50 above. It should be compared to Bereshit rabah 7: 5 (p. 54): “nefesh ḥayah:  this is the spirit of Adam.” The reference here is to the human soul, which is in the nature  of “animal” or “beast,” namely the animal soul.

This ‘strive’ resembles [the word ‘strife’ in] ‘and all the people were  at strife’ [2 Sam. 19: 10], which means ‘were agreed.’ Similarly, ‘My spirit shall not strive with  man’ [means that] the air will not agree with man but will strive with him and they [Adam  and Eve] will be destroyed in a short time. Rabbi Yosi said, ‘The Holy One blessed be He  removed the air from them and they fell’ ... said Rabbi Bo, ‘”My spirit shall not strive with  man” [Gen. 6: 3] ... For what reason? Because he is flesh and desires to sin every day. Yet  “his days shall be a hundred and twenty years” [ibid.], for the sake of their existence.’” (The  original text was published in Meroz, “Va’ani lo hayiti sham?!” 170.) 74 After the sin of the first man, who is the supernal Adam (see the main text, section 2.8),  there is no more “agreement” between him and the Ancient One (see n. 73 above), and  therefore the spirit of the Ancient One is no longer emanated to the supernal Adam; rather  it descends directly into the terrestrial man, but only for the prescribed duration of “one  hundred and twenty years,” instead of the ten thousand years that he could have had (see n.  75 below). This spirit emanates from the Ancient One in two measures, one from each of  His nostrils: the letter י, which measures one hundred, and the same letter in its expanded  form, when it is written out in full as דוי (see the discussion in section 2.10 below), which  by way of numerology, with the combined value of its three constituent letters, amounts  to no more than twenty (and therefore appears to contain less light than the one-hundred  measure of emanation that comes from the other nostril). 75 If Adam had not sinned, this lack of agreement would not have occurred and the yod would  have been able to illuminate “Zeʽir Anpin” (which is another name for Adam) for “ten thousand  years.” But Adam’s sin caused his measure of illumination, and therefore also his allotted years,  to diminish, with the result that [the terrestrial] man is granted no more than one hundred  and twenty years of illumination, namely, life. On the diminution of Adam in the classical  rabbinic sources, see e.g. BT Ḥag. 12a: “Rabbi Judah said, Rav said: ‘The first man [Adam]  extended from the earth to the heavens [according to another view, from one end of the world  to the other] ... As soon as he sinned, the Holy One, blessed be He, placed His hand upon  him and diminished him, for Scripture says, ‘And laid thy hand upon me’ [Ps. 139: 5].” See  also Bereshit rabah 8: 1 (p. 55). It appears that in SD, this theme includes an allusion to the  pans of the scales, known as “palms” in Hebrew (see the discussion in section 2.11 below) 76 This refers to the two ways of writing the letter yod, which correspond to the two nostrils,  and yield two different numerical values.

This claim is reinforced here by the  reference to “the fallen ones,” of whom Scripture says that they “were on the earth in those  days,” that is to say, they were already in existence at the time of Adam, not only later, as the  literal meaning of the verse suggests when it refers to them as the generations that descended  from Adam. For a similar claim see the text cited in Midrash hane‛elam as published in Meroz,  “Va’ani lo hayiti sham?!” 167. 78 In this paragraph, it is claimed that the “fallen ones” remained in the world until the time of  Joshua but no later. The argument is based on the identification of the spies with the “fallen  ones,” since Scripture says of the spies: “ Your terror has fallen upon us, and all the inhabitants  of the land faint because of you” ( Josh. 2: 9, although according to the literal meaning of  the verse, this refers not just to the spies but to the entire people of Israel), while about “the  fallen ones” it says, “And there we saw the Nephilim [the ‘fallen ones’], the sons of Anak,  who come from the Nephilim; and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so were  we in their sight” (Num. 13: 33). The biblical narrative also describes how the spies were  hidden ( Josh. 2: 4) and were not found when their pursuers sought them ( Josh. 2: 22). SD  interprets this final concealment of the spies as evidence that they existed on earth until,  but not any later than, the time of Joshua. Another reason for identifying the “fallen ones”  with the spies is the association of both with illicit sexual relations; see also §54 in the long  version. For a similar claim, see the text cited in Midrash hane‛elam as published in Meroz,  “Va’ani lo hayiti sham?!” 166 ff. These two texts resemble each other also in that they both  ignore the order of events as told in the Bible. For SD see, for example, the discussion in  section 2.2 below, and for the Midrash hane’elam see the explicit statement (after BT Pesa.  6b) that there is no earlier and later in the Bible (Meroz, “Va’ani lo hayiti sham?!” 168).

XXXIX Ronit  Meroz </page> <page sequence="32"> 1.4 The textual relation between the two versions The most obvious difference between the two versions is their respective  lengths: the short version contains approximately a quarter of the number  of words found in the long version. It is also strikingly clear that the short  version has been completely absorbed into the long version (albeit with  some minor variations), or, alternatively, that it is the product of extensive  omissions from the long version. This is quite unlike the relationship between  other units of zoharic text that are extant in several versions, which tend to  differ from each other not only in length but also in their actual wording.81 Since SD clearly belongs to the esoteric tradition, it is not impossible  that the short version is a précis of the long, and that its laconic style reflects  a deliberate attempt to convey no more than “chapter headings,”82 without  revealing too much to the uninitiated. The implication of this supposition  would be that the differences between the two versions do not affect their  core substance, as the main ideas are the same in both. Consequently, it  would be difficult to determine which version might be the earlier of the  two. The long and more developed version may have been composed first,  aiming at a restricted group of adepts, while the “chapter headings” of the  short version might have been extracted from it subsequently in order to  further restrict the dissemination of knowledge that was deemed to be unfit  for wider circulation. Conversely, the enigmatic “chapter headings” may have  constituted the original version of the work in its entirety, only later to be  expanded on the basis of oral traditions. Another approach to the relationship between the two versions is to focus  on such differences between them as may point to a disparity of substance  rather than of length or literary form. For example, the long version can  be seen as a particular development of the ideas suggested by the short  version, which may have reached the authors of the long version without an  accompanying oral tradition to elucidate its original meaning. They therefore  interpreted and expanded it to the best of their knowledge and understanding,  or according to some other, quite different oral tradition that was accessible to  them. In this case, we would have to demonstrate that even though the long  version they produced shared its textual core with the original short version,  they had altered it enough to invest the long version with an altogether  new meaning. On the other hand, it is also possible that the short version  was extracted at some point from an original long version by a process of  selection and sifting based on the conscious rejection of some of its ideas. 81 See n. 2 above. 82 After BT Hagiga 13a. XL The Archaeology of  the Zohar </page> <page sequence="33"> These considerations should help us determine whether the two versions  share their core substance, and which one predates the other. It is, however,  possible that even if one version was the earlier of the two, each would  have been corrected in light of the other during the centuries of continuous  copying of Zohar manuscripts. This would mean that the relationship  between the two versions was reciprocal, and that the differences that kept  them distinct from each other progressively levelled out. Moreover, if the  relation between the two versions was as complex as this, then it is not  impossible that there existed at least one other version of the same unit  of text. My analysis of the relationship between the two versions pursues all these  avenues of enquiry, giving equal consideration to each of the hypotheses  outlined above, but the conclusion I have reached is that the versions  differ from each other not only in length and form but also significantly  in substance. Assuming for a moment that the short version is indeed the  earlier of the two, I argue that although the long version depends on it  as its conceptual source, it clearly takes a different direction, investing the  old tenets with new meaning. The novelty of the long version emerges  clearly from the additional details it supplies, which render it relatively  comprehensible. This contrasts with the textual structure it inherited from  the short version, which is over-concise or deliberately enigmatic, almost  totally obscuring its meaning. On the other hand, if we nevertheless  assume that the short version was formed out of the long one by a gradual  process of selection, then certain elements of the long version would have  been deliberately omitted from it, in particular the expressions of radical  anthropomorphism. Either way, the comparison between the versions helps  us to disentangle the threads from which the long version was woven, and  to identify the distinct motifs that were entwined in it, apparently with no  concern for coherence. Having weighed all the options considered above, I am inclined to the  view that the short version, in the form in which it is extant today, is closer  to an earlier, unknown text that was the source of both versions. Although  I cannot as yet determine the matter conclusively, it is on this assumption  that the present article is based. For the time being, at any rate, the very  comparison between the two versions should enable us to gain a better  understanding of SD as a whole. 1.5 The continuous process of literary and conceptual revision The two versions of SD as presented above should by no means be assumed  to be the only ones that came into existence. In fact, my claim is that they  XLI Ronit  Meroz </page> <page sequence="34"> form only part of a continuous process of revision, in the course of which  an original set of concepts and textual units would have been expanded  by the incorporation of many new elements. SD is thus the product of  contributions by numerous individuals over time, rather than the work of  any one author, and it is doubtful that we would ever be able to unearth  and distinguish from one another all the textual strata that now make it  up. Yet the existence of such distinct strata becomes evident not only when  we compare the two versions to each other, but also as we note in each one  certain incongruities that may well point to the seams that have somewhat  clumsily stitched them together out of discrete sources. The textual incongruities discernible in the short version may indicate the  presence of glosses, inserted in order to introduce new ideas. An example  of this might be the rhetorical question “What is Sifra ditseniʽuta?” which  appears at the very beginning of this version. Does it actually belong to the  original text? Prima facie, “the Book of Concealment” is already available to  the questioner, who is attempting to describe or to define it, and in asking  the question, he is implicitly adding a new layer of commentary. If this is  the case, then the answer provided in §3 might also belongs to this new  layer of commentary. It relates SD to the theme of the kings, which forms  the basis of the anthropomorphic expansion characteristic of both the long  version and its subsequent adaptations in the Idras. Furthermore, in the  long version, the theme of the kings follows directly on the answer to the  opening question (at least implicitly, in §4 ff.). But this is not the case in  the short version, which returns to the topic only in §44. Was the original  text of the short version so disjointed from the start, or does its present  structure point to the gradual accumulation of diverse materials, resulting  in a patchwork of texts (or perhaps one basic text attracting additions)?  For the time being, this question must remain unanswered. An additional textual incongruity is encountered close by. The short  version discusses the expression “the second earth” (§7) without divulging  its meaning or its source. Only further in the text does it become apparent  that it refers to Genesis 1: 2. By contrast, the long version shows, step by  step, that it is commenting on the opening verses of Genesis, clarifying not  only that the concept of “second earth” originates in Genesis 1: 2, but also  what argument the commentary is making about it. In this case, the short  version seems clearly deficient. Yet another anomaly comes into view when the short version interprets  the phrase “the earth sprouted” (Gen. 1: 12) in §26, then turns to other  subject matters, only to pick up the phrase again in §36. The break might  be accounted for by a well-known editorial practice of medieval manuscript  XLII The Archaeology of  the Zohar </page> <page sequence="35"> copyists: when they finished inserting their own comments into the copied  text, they would return to the original by copying again the last few words  of the sentence preceding their own comments. The material now found  in the short version between the two references to Genesis 1: 12, which  clearly breaks the flow of the discussion, suggests the probability of precisely  such an interpolation. Finally, the presence of apparent terminological and conceptual  inconsistencies in the short version raises the question whether the diverse  views expressed throughout it are compatible with each other. For example,  the greater part of this version (from §13 on) refers to the originator of  all that happens by the divine name Elohim. However, Elohim is virtually  absent from the preceding paragraphs. In the discussion below (sections  2.3, 2.5, and 2.7) I attempt to resolve some of these difficulties, but the  possibility should not be excluded that they result from the amalgamation  of disparate texts. The textual problems stand out even more clearly in the long version,  which, in addition to the many incongruities it inherited from its precursor  (if we assume that the long version is indeed the later of the two), presents  many difficulties of its own. For example, the commentary it provides on  the first six chapters of Genesis – the central axis of Sifra ditseniʽuta – is  interrupted time and again by apparent interpolations, which offer no  comment whatsoever on Genesis or any other biblical text. Instances of this  include discussions of the supernal countenances (§§4-6, 14-17), the serpent  (§9), and the riddles that feature in §§66-7, which all break the flow of  the Genesis commentary. The diversity of these disruptive passages strongly  suggests that they were added in several stages and by multiple hands. The printed editions themselves testify to the existence of an additional  recension of the long version. From page 177b to page 178b, the text is  printed in two columns, one of them bearing the heading “another matter.”  This column adds new elements to the text, which focus on the technique  of contemplative prayer (kavanot). While the Zohar manuscripts containing the short version of SD position  it within the pericope “Bereshit,” which is appropriate, given its subject  matter, the printed editions (except for the one published in Cremona) place  the long version within the pericope “Terumah,” despite the fact that it has  no particular relevance to the substance of this pericope. Nevertheless, in the  introduction attached to the long version (Zohar ii. 176a), an association  is established between SD and the main theme of the biblical pericope  “Terumah,” by the attribution to the work of the following statement, which  refers to the building of the tabernacle according to Exodus 27: “And in  XLIII Ronit  Meroz </page> <page sequence="36"> SD we learnt: hooks [after Exod. 27: 10] above and hooks below, and all  of them are weighed in a single balance.”83 This apparent quotation from  SD does not appear in either the short or the long version of the work; its  only attestation is in the introduction appended to the latter.8 4 It therefore  suggests that there existed an additional version of SD, which dealt with  the connection between the creation of the world and the building of the  tabernacle – the probable reason why the printed editions incorporated the  long version in the pericope “Terumah.” The same applies to another passage  (Zohar iii. 146b), which may similarly belong to a layer of the Zohar that  linked SD to the pericope “Terumah.” The passage, which does not exist  in either of the versions, attributes to the work a discussion of the laws  of the Levite, which originate in Exodus 28 within that biblical pericope.  It reads: “In Tseniʽuta desifra85 we learn that a Levite who consecrates a  priest must first be consecrated himself.” The existence of such unknown  quotations from SD indicates that additional versions of the work, either  partial or whole, have not been preserved. The continuous process of textual and conceptual reworking does not stop  at the borderlines of what is considered to be SD. It goes on in many other  Zoharic units. This is especially true of the bulky Idras literature,86 which  can be seen as an expansion, even as additional versions, of the ideas and  text of the SD.87 That this process of reworking was continuous is evidenced  by numerous quotations from SD; notably, the Zohar contains thirty-seven  such quotations, all citing SD by name. Most of these quotations vary only  slightly from the readings found in the printed editions, but occasionally,  as we have seen, they are completely unknown.88 It is significant that all  the known quotations are taken from the long version, which, in its basic  form, I am inclined to view as the later of the two versions. In addition to the citations that appear in the Zohar, I have located  sixteen quotations from the SD in the writings of Joseph Angelit, who was  83 On the balance, see section 2.11 below. 84 See also at n. 179 below. 85 On the changes to the name of the book – Sifra ditseniʽuta (“Book of Concealment”),  Tseniʽuta desifra (“The Concealment of the Book”), or Tseniʽuta demalka (“The Modesty of  the King”), see Liebes, Torat hayetsirah, 130. 86 The use of this term follows Yehuda Liebes, “The Messiah of the Zohar: On R. Shimeon  bar Yohai as a Messianic Figure,” in Studies in the Zohar (Albany, NY: State University of  New York Press, 1993), 1-84, 163-193 especially pages 4-12. 87 This was first noted by Liebes, “How the Zohar was Written,”95ff. For additional details,  see Neta Sobol, “Ḥativat ha’idrot besifrut hazohar” (Ph.D. diss., under the supervision of R.  Meroz, Tel Aviv University, 2011), 116-199. 88 Yehuda Liebes has already noted this phenomenon in “How the Zohar Was Written,” 95-98. XLIV The Archaeology of  the Zohar </page> <page sequence="37"> active during the first three decades of the 14th century.89 All the quotations  are drawn from §§3-5 (usually as a single unit), 19, and 55-6 (the latter are  not included in the text presented in sections 1.2-1.3 above). As is evident  from the parallel versions of the text, Angelit based these quotations on the  long version. Additionally, at the turn of the 13th century, Rabbi David ben  Yehudah he-ḥasid wrote a commentatry (Sefer ha-Gevul) on an unknown  version of the Idra Rabba, which, likewise, makes several references to the  long version of SD.90 Thus, in addition to the Idras literature, there are a considerable number  of both transparent and opaque identifiable quotations from SD in the  zoharic corpus. A minority of them, those that are explicitly acknowledged  by the Zohar as quotations from SD, are unknown and do not actually occur  in the extant versions of SD, indicate the existence of further versions, while  the identifiable citations all originate in the long version. Several conclusions  may be drawn from these findings. First, it is clear that the authors of  the Zohar literature attributed a great deal of importance to SD, which  formed, it seems, the conceptual basis of many of the major themes that  feature in the corpus. Second, it appears that these authors were familiar  only with the long version of the work. Third, SD is clearly older than all  the zoharic texts that cite it. Hence the long version must have come into  being relatively early in the genealogy of the Zohar.91 If the short version,  which is never cited, is even earlier than the long, it may have been rejected  by the zoharic authors because it was superseded by the richer and more  expansive long version.92 On the other hand, if the short version is even  89 The following is a list of the references to SD in Angelit’s works (some pages contain more  than one such reference): Sefer livnat hasapir: perush Midrash haneʽelam vetosefta leSefer  hazohar ( Jerusalem: Dfus Azriel, 1913), on Genesis 1a, 3d, 4a, 12b, 65b; Livnat Hasapir on  Leviticus (London, British Library, MS Add. 27000 [Margoliouth, 767; microfilm no. 5663]),  16th-century Sephardi script, 328b, 335b, 347a; Qupat harokhlin (Oxford, Bodleian Library,  MS Opp. 228 [Neubauer, 1618; microfilm no. 17196]), 15th- or 16th-century Sephardi  (Provençal?) script, 96b; Sefer esrim ve’arba‛ah sodot (Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Opp.  Add.

For some of the studies that deal with this question, see n. 1 above. 92 In other parts of the Zohar, too, where early variants have survived in a handful of manuscripts,  this was precisely because they were superseded by more contemporary versions. See n. 8  above. XLV Ronit  Meroz </page> <page sequence="38"> later than the long, then it may not have been cited because it had not yet  existed when the zoharic corpus was coming into being. In this case, we  would have to conclude that the short version was created in the course of  the 14th century (to which the Vatican manuscript of this version is dated). 2. Cycles of Creation and Failure 2.1 A preliminary remark on methodology Zohar scholars and commentators alike tend to base their interpretations  on the juxtaposition of parallel texts within the corpus. When a zoharic  text appears to be defective in one place, it is supplemented by material  drawn from another, where the same issues are discussed at greater length or  expressed more clearly. This method is warranted and effectively unavoidable,  but it is based on the assumption that the ideas expressed throughout the  Zohar represent one and the same conceptual framework. If, however, as  we now begin to realize, the Zohar is made up of disparate strata, piled  one above the other like the layers of an onion, then this method must  be used with great caution. Where no alternative is available, every effort  should be made to ascertain, as far as this is possible in the present state  of our knowledge, that the juxtaposed parallel passages belong to the same  “archaeological” stratum of the text. At the same time, careful attention  should be paid to all possible sources of conceptual inspiration that are  unquestionably earlier than any zoharic text. In other words, when the  synchronicity and conceptual compatibility of apparent zoharic parallels is  in question, the relative weight ascribed to data drawn from earlier sources  should be increased.93 2.2 The basic principles of SD’s commentary on Genesis SD’s commentary on Genesis is based on a well-known distinction between  the two consecutive accounts of the creation at the beginning of the book  of Genesis. In the first account, God’s name is Elohim, while in the second,  it is YHVH Elohim. SD interprets this disparity by assuming that Elohim is  an incomplete version of God’s name, while YHVH Elohim is the complete  form 44 ,36 ,20§§ (םלש  םש). For this reason, everything created by Elohim is  itself incomplete, in contrast to YHVH Elohim’s creation, which is complete.94  93 For an additional discussion of this methodology, see Meroz, Yuvalei zohar, particularly ch.  5. 94 Note that in Bereshit rabah, 13: 3 (p. 115), YHVH Elohim is called a “full name (אלמ םש)  over a full world,” and in Zohar 1:20a (and elsewhere), the same combination of names is  referred to as the “full name.” For more on this, see section 2.4 below. XLVI The Archaeology of  the Zohar </page> <page sequence="39"> The incomplete creation was soon destroyed, or, as we shall see, “fell,” and it  required renewal and restoration. Furthermore, the name Elohim is known  as “the female side” in SD, while YHVH is referred to as “the male side”  (§44). I assume that SD also holds the rabbinic view that these two names  refer to the qualities of Judgement and Compassion respectively.95 Idel has  already shown that the kabbalistic theology of sexual union between these  two divine names has its origin in the classical rabbinic sources, and the  examples he adduces would seem to apply to SD as well.96 Thus, according to SD, the first chapter of Genesis, and the first three  verses of the second chapter, describe actions carried out by the quality of  Judgement – a feminine quality, acting alone and producing flawed beings  that cannot be sustained in the state in which they were created. These  flawed acts of creation cease with the cessation of all work on the Sabbath  (Gen. 2: 1-3). By contrast, from Genesis 2: 4 onwards, the qualities of  Judgement and Compassion are described as co-operating in the production  of sustainable beings, or the “renewal” of beings whose creation was flawed  at its inception.97 From this point on, the names Elohim and YHVH Elohim  alternate, and the products of their respective actions are accordingly either  flawed or complete. This alternation between completion and flaw applies not  only to the creation of Adam but also to the generations of his descendants,  and by implication, it continues to this very day. However, one of the SD’s innovations is the claim that all these creative  processes were preceded by an even earlier stage, concealed within the first  verse of the Book of Genesis. According to this reading of the verse, the  entity called bereshit, identified with the divine name YHVH and associated  with the quality of Compassion alone, created six other entities, among  them the divine names Elohim, as well as Shamayim (Heaven) and Eretz  (Earth). The very fact that Elohim, one of YHVH’s own creations, was  incomplete and incapable of producing anything but incomplete creations,  implies that when YHVH acted alone, it, too, was incomplete. The entire  creation, therefore, alternates between completed and flawed, incomplete  states of being, and when it is flawed, it requires renewal and restoration.  These alternations begin with YHVH acting alone to produce an incomplete  creation; they continue with the incomplete creations generated by Elohim on  95 Bereshit rabah, 12: 15 (pp. 112-13). 96 See, Idel, in many of his publications, e.g. Moshe Idel, Kabbalah – New Perspectives (New  Haven: Yale University Press, 1988), 128-136. 97 Cf. Nachmanides’ commentary on Gen. 2: 1, which draws an analogy between the first  and second creations. In SD the two creations are not analogous, but rather the second is a  renewal of the first. XLVII Ronit  Meroz </page> <page sequence="40"> its own; and they reach conclusion only when the two of them collaborate  by mitigating Compassion with Judgement to produce a complete creation. SD associates the incidents of corruption that occurred in primordial  history with a cyclical process that repeats itself from the creation of the  world to this day. Although the primordial incidents of corruption were  not man’s fault, once he was created, they clearly came to depend on his  actions, particularly, as we shall see, on his mystical practices and sexual  behaviour. The short version of SD is concerned with cycles which are not  time-bound, but rather comprise a fixed set of recurrent events – creation,  fall (as distinct from total destruction), and renewal. The wealth of ideas  crammed into the long version has obscured this characteristic of the  short version, and moreover, the long version, unlike the short, is expressly  concerned with temporal cycles as well (see §9; and the beginning of §73,  which is not included in the text presented in sections 1.2-1.3 above). Another principle underlying the short version is that these cycles  indicate fixed patterns of activity that are repeated at every stage of the  creation. Admittedly, the basic contours of the biblical text on which SD  is commenting98 prevent it from drawing precise parallels between all these  stages of creation, but a partial parallel, however incomplete, suffices for  its purpose. For example, it is enough that the “incomplete” name Elohim  (rather than the “complete name” YHVH Elohim) is mentioned in a biblical  text for SD to detect a flaw in the activity associated with it; it is enough  that some “fall” is alluded to in a biblical or classical rabbinic source (e.g.,  the diminution of the moon), for SD to fill in the “gaps” according to its  own principles. The fact that the biblical text does not lend itself fully to  SD’s cyclical patterning, at least not as an overall organizing principle, makes  it harder to understand how SD chooses to read it. It is therefore no wonder  that unlike many of its other distinctive ideas and terms, SD’s particular  notion of cycles has left hardly any imprint on the later development of  the Kabbalah.99 In its interpretations of the biblical text, SD makes use of diverse  midrashic techniques, often without sufficient indications of its method.  Examples of this are the frequent switches from one meaning of a word  to another, leaving the readers to work out for themselves which meaning  is relevant in each case. Thus, when commenting on the verses in Genesis  where the Hebrew word ḥayah (“living creature”) occurs, SD takes it to  98 Or, more accurately, the midrashic interpretations of the biblical text. 99 The notion that everything reflects what lies above it or has preceded it is common in  Kabbalah, but this is not the case with the principle of cycles of creation and destruction. XLVIII The Archaeology of  the Zohar </page> <page sequence="41"> mean not only “animal” but also – as in Ezekiel’s vision of the Chariot –  an angel or some other heavenly entity, as well as the soul that enlivens  all creatures, and the basest element of the human soul, the “animal soul.”  Another example is the ambiguity of the term tseniʽuta in the very title of  the work, whose multiple meanings, as will be shown below, are exploited  to allude to the complex ideas contained in the text. All in all, SD’s exegetical methodology is markedly aggressive. As we  have seen (in section 1.5, for example), it violates the chronology of the  biblical narrative of man’s creation by taking the first account, in Genesis  1: 26, to refer to a later stage of the process than the one described in  the second account, in Genesis 2: 7. By the same token, the “earth” of  Genesis 1: 2 is assumed to have been cursed by Adam’s sin, even though  in the Genesis narrative, Adam had not yet been created at that stage of  the proceedings. It would seem that these blatant departures from the plain  chronology of the biblical text are driven by the distinction between the  divine names Elohim and YHVH Elohim – an exegetical principle to which  SD gives precedence over all other considerations. 2.3 Creation (§7) SD begins its exegesis with the Hebrew letters that make up the opening  verses of the book of Genesis. The interpretation it offers concerns the  substance of the biblical text, but it focuses primarily on the structural and  mathematical aspects of the language. The first verse of Genesis, which deals with the creation, consists of  seven Hebrew words, normally translated into English as: “In the beginning  (be-reshit) Elohim [God] created [bara] the heavens and the earth.” For  SD, which takes the Hebrew sentence to mean that Beginning (bereshit)  created Elohim, the heavens and the earth, these seven words represent  seven distinct hypostases, the first being the ontological origin, and thus  the creator, of the other six (§7), although regrettably, they are not fully  identified by name or defined by their characteristics. In addition, SD  assumes that the biblical text furnishes us with two other allusions to its  true meaning. First, from the six letters that make up the Hebrew word for  “in the beginning” (תישארב) it learns that this word in its entirety – itself  one the seven hypostases – contains within it six other hypostases, each  represented by one of the six letters that constitute the word. Secondly, it  arrives at the true meaning of this word by breaking it up into two distinct  words, “created” (ארב) and “six” (תיש). Thus “six” becomes the direct object  of “created,” and the two words are understood in the sense of “[He/it]  created six [hypostases].” This exegesis is based primarily on counting words  XLIX Ronit  Meroz </page> <page sequence="42"> and letters, but it nevertheless retains a connection to the plain meaning of  the Genesis text inasmuch as it concerns the process of creation and the  nature of some of the created beings. This be-reshit is also YHVH as well  as God’s glory, and it is also called hu, the Hebrew demonstrative pronoun,  which is supposed to designate its concealment from human perception. This part of the exegesis appears in the long version but is missing from  the short one. However, since the discussion that follows, which is present  in the short version, is entirely based on the concept of created hypostases  and makes no sense without it, this concept must lie at the basis of the  short version as well, and is missing from it for technical reasons only (see  section 1.5 above). The commentators on SD assume that the hypostases discussed here  are the divine sefirot. This theosophical interpretation can indeed find  “anchorage” in the long version (for instance, in §10),100 but not so in the  short version, which can be understood without it. I suggest, therefore, that  the short version was not based on the kabbalistic theosophy of the sefirot,  but rather drew on pre-thirteenth century exegetical traditions regarding  the Hebrew alphabet. These comprise certain classical rabbinic sources,101  the Heikhalot literature, and some geonic commentaries on the alphabet,  such as Seder raba dibereshit, Sefer otiyot deRabi Aqiva (versions a and b),  Midrash alfa beitot, and several others.102 It appears that the latter group  has the clearest links to SD. 100 For the methodological principle of “anchoring” any symbolic interpretation of a zoharic  term in no other textual unit but the one in which that particular term occurs, see Meroz,  Yuvalei zohar, ch. 5, §4. See also section 2.1 above. 101 See e.g. Bereshit rabah, 1: 10-11 (pp. 9-10), 12: 9-10 (pp. 107-9); BT Shab. 104a, Men. 29b,  Suk. 53a-b; JT Ḥag. 77c. 102 For Seder raba dibereshit, see Solomon A.

For Sefer otiyot deRabi ‛Aqiva (versions a and  b), see e.g. Wertheimer, Batei midrashot, 2:333-418 (the quotations below are drawn from  that edition); Eliane Ketterer, “Otiyot deRabi ‛Aqiva (nusaḥ a-b): mahuto shel midrash zeh,  megamato, ray’onotav uqesharav im zeramim shonim bayahadut uvanatsrut,” (Ph.D. diss.,  Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 2005), vol. 2 (her entire study is devoted to this text). On  L The Archaeology of  the Zohar </page> <page sequence="43"> The text that is most relevant to our discussion is Seder raba dibereshit,  which states in its opening paragraph: “Do not read ‘in the beginning’  [תישארב], but [read] ‘created six’  [תיש  ארב],”103 although it does not clarify  what these six created entities might be.104 There is, however, one clue in SD as to the nature of the created entities:  §7 draws our attention to the fact that the second verse in Genesis begins  with “and the earth,” which it takes to be a reference to “the second earth,”  since this is the second appearance of the word in the chapter. However,  this observation is immediately qualified by the statement that this second  “earth” should not be discussed at this stage, since it was produced from the  “soil that YHVH cursed” (Gen. 5: 29). According to SD, the “second earth”  is cursed because of the sin of Adam, whereas everything that happened  to the “first earth” – as emerges from the context – happened before the  creation of Adam, so that Adam could have had no part in its downfall.  This reinforces the suggestion that the “first earth” was indeed one of the  six hypostases created in the beginning. It thus seems that SD brings us  back to the literal meaning of Genesis 1: 1 (and to Seder raba dibereshit),  by taking the verse to mean that, indeed, the heavens and the earth were  created in the beginning. 2.4 Destruction (§§7, 8, 12) Up to this point, SD has introduced the six entities that were created from  “the beginning” (be-reshit), and alluded to certain mishaps that blighted the  early stages of the creation. What, then, were these mishaps, which preceded  the creation of man? What happened to the “first earth” and to the other  entities created with it? According to SD, these events are described by  the thirteen Hebrew words that follow the initial reference to “the earth”  in Genesis 1: 2. The verse reads: “[And the earth] was waste and empty,  with darkness over the face of the abyss and the wind of Elohim hovering  Midrash alfa beitot, see Wertheimer, Batei midrashot, 2:419-59. In Wertheimer’s view, this work  is part of Sefer otiyot deRabi ‛Aqiva. Midrash alfa beitot is briefly discussed also in Ketterer,  “Otiyot deRabi Aqiva,” 2:148-59. For a comprehensive discussion of the commentaries  on the alphabet, see also Elias Lipiner, Ḥazon ha’otiyot: torat ha’ide’ot shel ha’alefbeit ha’ivri  ( Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1989); Tzahi Weiss, “Otiyot shenivre’u bahen shamayim va’arets”  (Ph.D. diss., Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 2008). 103 Wertheimer, Batei midrashot, 1:19, and version b, ibid., 365; Schäfer, Synopse zur Hekhalot- Literatur, §§429, 832. For similar interpretations in rabbinic literature, see BT Suk. 49a;  Bereshit rabah 1: 4 (p. 6) and the editor’s notes ad loc. 104 Although this is followed by the statement that the beings created were either heaven and  earth or this world and the next. See also Bereshit rabah 1: 14 (p. 12). LI Ronit  Meroz </page> <page sequence="44"> over the face of the waters.” According to SD, this refers to the destruction  of the created thirteen supernal entities (§7), which were destined to be  renewed at a later stage (§8). To remove any doubt about this, SD repeats  and emphasizes that the earth “was” (Gen. 1: 2), “for it surely was!” meaning  that it was and is no longer, as it has become desolate.105 According to the long version, this devastation was completed in twelve  hours, while according to the short version, it lasted thirteen hours. In this  case, the text of the short version fits more naturally into the immediate  context of the discussion, where the exegesis is based on the count of  thirteen words following the word “the earth” in Genesis 1: 2. In addition,  while previously each of the six letters in the word be-reshit (“in the  beginning”), or each of the seven words in Genesis 1:1, represents a created  entity, now each of these elements represents a stage of devastation, and  their total number represents the duration of the entire devastation. Here  too, the exegesis is not entirely divorced from the substance of the verse, if  not necessarily cleaving to its plain, literal meaning: “waste and emptiness”  are taken to refer not to the initial state of the creation, but rather to its  subsequent destruction, which preceded its renewal in sustainable form. And so, according to both versions, “six were created” and “those six”  (§8) were destroyed. Yet according to all the commentaries on SD, the  number of entities that were destroyed was decidedly seven, not six! One  of the earliest commentaries, the Idra raba, which forms part of the Zohar  itself, highlights the point by evoking the symbol of the seven kings of  Edom.106 Might the discrepancy between six and seven be explained as  arising from scribal error in the transmission of SD? There are a number of  indications that this is not the case. Firstly, the text alludes to the number  of destroyed entities by stating: “as Scripture says [Gen. 1: 1]: ‘created’”  (§8). That is to say, the entities that were destroyed are to be counted from  the second Hebrew word of Genesis 1: 1 – bara (“created”), not from the  first – be-reshit (“in the beginning”), and the total number of Hebrew words  in that verse, counting from the second word on, is indeed six, not seven.  Secondly, SD goes on to describe (still in §8) the destruction of these  entities in laconic style, suggesting that “afterwards Scripture says [of the  earth, that it] ‘was’ [Gen. 1: 1], for it surely was! And in the end, [according  to Scripture, it became] ‘waste and empty, with darkness’ [ibid.] – ‘YHVH  alone was exalted on that day’ [Isa. 2: 11]” (§8). From this we learn that,  105 SD bases itself here on the exegesis in Bereshit rabah 1: 14 (p. 13), albeit with a certain change  of meaning. 106 Zohar 3:135a-b (Idra raba); Gen. 36: 31-9. LII The Archaeology of  the Zohar </page> <page sequence="45"> according to SD, two verses refer to the destruction – one from Genesis  and another from Isaiah. The first describes the actual destruction, while the  second introduces a reservation – not everything was destroyed; one entity,  represented (according to the Isaiah verse) by the name YHVH, remained,  exalted in solitude. Following the earlier claim whereby the words from  “created” onwards in the first verse of Genesis represent the entities that  were destroyed, we must assume that the one exalted entity that survived,  the name YHVH, is the originator of the other six, represented by the  opening word of the verse – be-reshit (“in the beginning”).107 A third reason for rejecting the possibility that the number six is a scribal  error arises from the fact that in both versions of §12, six entities feature  again, depicted as branches emerging from a root.1 08 This “root,” according to  the same paragraph, is the name YHVH, which – as we have just seen – is  probably yet another representation of the hypostasized Hebrew word for  “in the beginning,” be-reshit. The branches, emerging between the letters yod  and heh of the name, are likened to a tongue “speaking grandly” – a phrase  which carries the negative connotations of its biblical origin in Daniel 7: 8  into SD’s description of the devastation. The description acquires yet another  107 In the account of the creation in the first chapter of Genesis, YHVH is not mentioned at  all; in this sense, surely, it is “exalted” beyond perception. 108 Isaac the Blind uses a similar image; see his commentary on Sefer Yetsira. See the text in  Gershom Scholem, The Kabbalah in Provence [Haqabalah biprovans], edited from lectures by  Rivka Schatz ( Jerusalem: n.p., 1976), appendix 10 and the discussion ibid., 210-13; Haviva  Pedaya, Hashem vehamiqdash bemishnat R. Yitsḥaq Sagi Nehor: ‛iyun mashveh bekhitvei rishonei  hamequbalim ( Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 2001), 75. As noted above (section 2.2), SD tends  to subject the physical creation and the principles governing its conduct to a fixed pattern of  cycles of creation and destruction. This pattern may be discernible in the six created entities,  which may refer also to the descendants of Adam and Eve – Cain and his twin sister, Abel  and his two twin sisters (see e.g. Bereshit rabah 22: 2 (p. 205)), and Seth. For other rabbinic  views on the number of Adam and Eve’s descendants, see Louis Ginzberg, The Legends  of the Jews, trans. from the German manuscript by Henrietta Szold (Philadelphia: Jewish  Publication Society of America, 1910-1954), 5:138-9, n. 17, in reference to ibid., 1:108. This  suggestion may be supported by the observation that many of the 13th-century discussions  on forbidden sexual relations utilize terms taken from the semantic field of “branch/root.”  See, for example, Maimonides, Guide of the Perplexed, book 3, ch. 49; Asher ben David in  the name of Isaac the Blind, in R.

In its present state, SD does not belong to any  of the traditions mentioned above, but its possible connection to them should be noted, as  an unknown link may come to light in future research. LIII Ronit  Meroz </page> <page sequence="46"> negative connotation from the following depiction of branches emerging  from a root: Rabbi Eleazar ben Azariah used to say: ... one whose wisdom  exceeds his deeds, to what is he to be compared? To a tree whose  branches are many and whose roots are few, so that when the  wind comes, it uproots it and overturns it ... but one whose deeds  exceed his wisdom, to what is he to be compared? To a tree whose  branches are few and the roots many, so that even if all the winds  in the world come and blow upon it, they move it not out of its  place, as Scripture says, “For he shall be as a tree planted by the  waters” [ Jer. 17:8].109 SD refers to these ruinous events mainly by terms derived from the Hebrew  root ב-ר-ח (ḥet-resh-bhet), whose most common meaning is “destroy.” But  does this mean that the six created entities were completely destroyed? Note  that their re-creation is referred to by the Aramaic root מ-ו-ק (quf-vav- mem), which has multiple meanings, and the text appears to be consciously  exploiting at least some of them – exist, rise or raise, as well as resurrect.110  Thus the re-creation of the six “destroyed” entities is described as follows:  “The Thirteen will raise them in Compassion – and they will be renewed  as before – and all those six will rise” (§8). If destruction is contrasted here  not with what is perhaps the most common meaning, namely “existence,”  but rather with being “raised” and “rising,” then surely, it must signify a fall  or a descent. According to the analogous events repeatedly described in the  subsequent paragraphs of SD, the root ב-ר-ח should indeed be understood  as a reference not to destruction but to a fall (see below, sections 2.7, 2.8,  2.9). This interpretation is reinforced by the contrast between the fate of  the six “destroyed” entities, which I take to be fallen or impaired rather  than annihilated, and that of the single entity that remained intact. The  latter is said to be “exalted,” that is, lofty and elevated,111 which again  suggests that the former are fallen or brought low. Note also the phrase  “renewed as before,” which appears to echo the biblical verse “Renew  our days as of old” (Lam. 5: 21). SD is therefore referring expressly to  109 Pirqei avot 3: 17. 110 See Sokoloff, Palestinian Aramaic, p 479 ff.; id., A Dictionary of Jewish Babylonian Aramaic  of the Talmudic and Geonic Periods (Ramat-Gan: Bar Ilan University Press, 2002), 992 ff. 111 See Ben-Yehuda, Eliezer, Milon halashon haʽivrit hayeshanah vehaḥadashah (Tel Aviv: Hotza’at  Laʽam, 1948-1959), 7521-2, s.v. בגש. LIV The Archaeology of  the Zohar </page> <page sequence="47"> renewal, not to creation anew.112 If the entities that were destroyed were  not completely annihilated but had only fallen or been brought low, their  renewal is the restoration of what survived but had become desolate. It  appears that “renewal” anticipates the term that was to become so popular  in later Kabbalah (and has even found its way into contemporary common  parlance), that is, cosmic “rectification,” known by the Hebrew term tiqun.113 This description of the destruction seems to be based on a wide range  of traditions. Its association with the “complete name” (םלש  םש) evokes, as  noted above,114 the expression “full name” (אלמ  םש), and occurs again in  the context of cosmic destruction in the midrashic anthology Pesiqta derav  kahana: For he said, because YH [has sworn], by  the laying of His hand on  His throne, that the Lord will wage war on Amalek [from generation  to generation] [Exod. 17: 16] ... As long as the seed of Amalek  exists in the world, neither the name nor the throne is complete  (םלש). When the seed of Amalek is destroyed, both the name and  the throne will be complete. What is the reason for this? “The enemy  is no more – ruins everlasting; you have torn down their cities; their  very names are lost” [Ps. 9: 7]. What is written after that? “But the  YHVH abides for ever; He has set up His throne for judgement”  [Ps. 9: 8].115 112 See also ibid., 1456-7, s.v. שדח. This root occurs in Isaiah, the Talmud, and the commentaries  on the alphabet (see below, at nn. 120,118, 122, respectively). 113 The root ן-ק-ת (tav-quf-nun) does appear in the short version of SD, but not in reference to  the restoration of a destroyed entity to its previous state. In §46 we find it referring to “a nest”  which was set up or constructed (ןקתתא) within Eve, to become “an evil abode.” Since there  is no mention of any previous existence of such a nest or evil abode, the verb in this case  cannot possibly refer to the nest being “restored” (for more on this, see section 2.9 below).  Similarly, in §44 the male organ is described as extending and preparing itself (ןקתתא) to  enter the mouth of the Mother, but this, again, is not a reference to its “restoration” to a  previous state of being (see also section 2.8 below). However, the text goes on directly to  describe what clearly is the “restoration” or “re-establishment” of previously destroyed entities:  “the kings who were ruined were here established” (see section 2.8 below). and in this case,  the root ן-ק-ת is not mentioned at all. See also Ben-Yehuda, Milon halashon haʽivrit, s.v. ,ןקת  7879-85. In the long version, a noun derived from the root ן-ק-ת acquires a new meaning  in the description of the “enhancements” of the supernal Head, which are its “garments of  glory” – the divine countenance and, specifically, the beard. Here the reference seems to be  to decoration, beautification, and grooming, especially of the hair. For all these meanings,  see Ben-Yehuda, Milon halashon haʽivrit, s.v. 7879-85 ,ןקת; Liebes, “Messiah,” 19-20, 52-74. 114 See section 2.2 and n. 94. 115 Pesikta de Rav Kahana, ed.

(Newark: Jewish Theological  LV Ronit  Meroz </page> <page sequence="48"> The completion of the name [YHVH instead of YH only] depends,  therefore, on the destruction of Israel’s typological enemy, Amalek. In  light of this exegesis, it seems that SD associates the “full name” (אלמ  םש)  with the “complete name” (םלש  םש), and with the restoration of the flawed  creation to a state of perfection, implying that the forces of evil have been  destroyed. By contrast, the previous state of the creation, while the name  was neither full nor complete, is identified in SD with the presence of evil  and ruination. Cosmic destruction similarly features in a number of other sources,  echoing the rabbinic questions whether the world was created by the quality  of Judgement or the quality of Compassion, and whether it would have  endured had it been created by either one of them alone.116 For example:  “God created worlds and destroyed them until He created these, saying,  ‘These please me and those do not.’ ”117 Another example is the talmudic  tradition on the same theme, which introduces the additional notion that  worlds are repeatedly created and destroyed in cyclical time: R. Qattina said: “Six thousand years shall the world exist, and one  [thousand, the seventh], it shall be desolate, as Scripture says: ‘And  YHVH alone will be exalted on that day’ [Isa. 2: 11].” Abaye said: “It  will be desolate two [thousand] ...” It has been taught in accordance  with R. Qattina: Just as the seventh year is one year of release in  seven, so the world: one thousand years out of seven shall be fallow,  as Scripture says [Isa. 2: 11]: “And YHVH alone will be exalted on  that day” ... the day that is altogether Sabbath ... the Holy One,  blessed be He, will renew His world only after seven thousand years. 118 According to this passage, the world will endure for six thousand years, and  on the seventh, the cosmic Sabbath, it will be fallow, waste, and desolate,  after which time, the Lord will renew it. This talmudic passage provides  SD with the reference to the verse in Isaiah, which enables it to emphasize  that the destruction does not affect the deity itself. Seminary, 1987), pisqa 3, “Zakhor” (p. 53). See also Pedaya’s discussion of this idea in early  Kabbalah, in Hashem vehamiqdash, 103-47. 116 See e.g. Bereshit rabah 12: 15 (pp. 112-13). Notably, for SD, the world was first created  by the quality of Mercy, then by the quality Judgement, but in neither case did it achieve  sustainability until the qualities of Judgement and Compassion combined to complete it  and to ensure its endurance. 117 Bereshit rabah 3: 5 (p .23). 118 BT San. 97a-b. LVI The Archaeology of  the Zohar </page> <page sequence="49"> The doctrine of cyclical time is more developed in the kabbalistic  tradition. Nachmanides and his followers are particularly well known  for espousing this doctrine, as are also the anonymous Sefer hatemunah  and the sixteenth-century kabbalist and legalist, David ben Zimra.119 The  salient characteristics of the kabbalistic doctrine of cyclical time are the  identification of the cycles (shemitot) with the divine hypostases (the seven  lower sefirot), and the claim that each cycle of the world’s physical existence  (shemitah) is an incarnation of a particular sefirah. These doctrines are of no  help in understanding the short version of SD, since kabbalistic theosophy  is not discernible in its conceptual background. Of more relevance to the short version are the commentaries on the  alphabet dating from geonic times, which clearly reflect doctrines of creation  and destruction, and whose relationship to the SD has not been noticed so  far. The destruction of the worlds features in these texts in a wide range  of contexts, with particular emphasis on the parallels between the creation  and the end of the world. They present a more radical perspective on the  biblical view of the end of time. On the one hand, they rely on the biblical  descriptions of the “day of the Lord,” the day that precedes the redemption  and is marked by affliction, distress, and desolation; on the other hand, they  make use of the words of Isaiah (65: 17), “For behold, I create new heavens  and a new earth; and the former shall not be remembered, nor come to  mind. ”1 20 Thus, in these commentaries, cosmic destruction is regarded as an  important part of the process of new creation, characteristic of the end of  days and paralleling the first creation: [The Holy One, blessed be he] scrambles heavens and earth, [throwing]  one on top of the other.121 He destroys the entire world and returns  it to emptiness and waste, as Scripture says: “Lift up your eyes to  the heavens,” etc. [“Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon  119 For a more comprehensive discussion, see e.g. Gershom Scholem, Origins of the Kabbalah  (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1987), 460-75; Pedaya, Haramban, passim. 120 According to the literal meaning of the verse, the “former” which shall not be remembered  are the afflictions discussed in the preceding verse. However, it seems that the commentary  understands these verses to mean that the former heavens and earth are the ones that will  be forgotten, as will be shown below. 121 Compare this presentation of the throwing of heaven and earth together as a destructive  “scrambling” of the creation, with the following account of the mixing together of fire and  water, which is presented as a positive act of “formation”: “The Lord took fire and water,  he beat them up together and from them the heavens were formed” (Bereshit rabah 4: 8 [p.  31]).

The main  difference, however, between these two visions of destruction is that the  geonic exegesis is concerned with events in the future, while SD deals with  events in the past. To leave no doubt as to the nature of this future devastation, the geonic  commentary goes on to describe it in greater detail: And He takes from every angel and from every seraph his soul and  his spirit and his dominion and his holy spirit, so that they will all  perish as one. At that time, no progeny of the heavens or the earth  will remain, neither of ministering angels nor of the creatures created  by the Holy One blessed be He, but He alone, as Scripture says: “And  YHVH alone will be exalted on that day” [Isa. 2: 11]. What is alone?  Without His throne, without His glory, without His servants, His  slaves, His palaces, without anything apart from the righteous, whom  the Holy One blessed be He bears on His wings, as Scripture says: “He  shall cover you with His feathers [and under His wings shall you find  refuge,” Ps. 91: 4] ... And when He renews the world to come, He  renews His throne and His glory, His canopy and His seat of glory,  and He places the righteous in the world like the ministering angels.123 All that was created is destroyed, with the exception of the Lord and the  righteous, who alone endure. Note that the verse from Isaiah, “And YHVH  alone will be exalted on that day,” appears again and again in the classical  rabbinic texts, in Midrash ha’otiyot, and in SD. According to the passage  from Midrash alfa beitot just quoted, at the time of the destruction, the Lord  alone will remain, together with the righteous, but in another part of the  same text, God’s throne survives the destruction rather than the righteous: He [the Holy One, blessed be He] injures, rends, and scrambles the  heavens and the earth, one on top of the other, beneath His two  122 “Midrash alfa beitot,” in Wertheimer, Batei midrashot, 2:436.

LVIII The Archaeology of  the Zohar </page> <page sequence="51"> arms,124 and He destroys the entire world in a moment, as Scripture  says: “For His anger lasts but a moment; in His favour is life” [Ps.  30: 6]. And all that would be left of them is the throne of glory, and  the Holy One, blessed be He would sit on it alone in His glory, as  Scripture says: “And YHVH alone will be exalted on that day” [Isa.  2: 11]. What is alone? That even the living creatures of the Chariot,  the ofanim, cherubim, wheels, seraphim, tafsarim, and er’elim will  perish with them, as Scripture says: “None can deliver out of my  hand” [Deut. 32: 39].125 2.5 Renewal (§8) Six entities were created, destroyed, and – after a time – renewed, or rather,  “raised” from their fall. How? According to SD, “The Thirteen will raise  them in Compassion – and they will be renewed as before” (§8). “As before”  suggests that there would be no difference between the first creation and  the second, which raises the question why it was ever necessary for the  six entities to be destroyed. Generations of kabbalists have grappled with  this question, generally responding to it with the assumption – clearly  formulated, for example, in Lurianic Kabbalah – that a certain flaw in the  makeup of the first creation necessitated its destruction. SD similarly assumes that the original creation was indeed flawed: the  world was first created by the quality of Compassion alone, and then by the  quality of Judgement on its own. These two creations were destroyed and  subsequently renewed by the mitigation of Judgement with Compassion,  and the product of this renewal did endure.126 It should be emphasized that according to the long version of SD, the  capacity of this renewed creation to endure depended on the enhancement  of the uppermost “countenance” of the “Head,” thus enabling what had  already been created to endure (mainly §§4-7). But this idea is unique  to the long version, and therefore it cannot shed any light on the rather  obscure notion of “renewal” in the short version. On the other hand, one  of the geonic commentaries on the alphabet, already referred to above,  offers relevant material on this point.127 According to Midrash alfa beitot,  124 According to Deut. 33: 27, “ The eternal God is your dwelling place, and underneath are the  everlasting arms.”  125 “Midrash alfa beitot,” in Wertheimer, Batei midrashot, 2:429. 126 Cf. Bereshit rabah 12: 15 (pp. 112-13). 127 For the methodological background of this scrutiny see section 2.1. LIX Ronit  Meroz </page> <page sequence="52"> the destruction of the first creation is the manifestation of God’s free will  and His opportunity to demonstrate that just as He alone had created the  world, He alone would destroy it.128 This interpretation is reminiscent of the  classical rabbinic view whereby the creation of the world was accomplished  by God alone129 – a view which is commonly taken to represent a polemic  stand against dualistic or binitarian beliefs. It is not impossible that the same  polemical intent underlies the following passage from Midrash alfa beitot: Why did the Holy One, blessed be He, not leave the holy living  creatures of the Chariot, the ofanim, seraphim, cherubim, wheels,  tafsarim, and er’elim which stand and serve before Him and His  glory? So that not even one of those who stand and serve before  Him would be able to say, “I created the renewal of the world with  the Holy One.” As Scripture says: “I have made, and I will bear”  [Isa. 46: 4]; I have made the world, I will bear the generations of the  world, I will carry [ibid.] the burden of its destruction, and I will  deliver you [ibid.] from the whole world.130 Whether or not the same answer is implicit in the short version of SD,  it is worth noting that a geonic commentary on the alphabet shares with  the short version the claim that the world was re-created by the quality  of “Compassion”: Said the Holy One, blessed be He: “I created the world with the  quality of Compassion, I conduct it with the quality of Compassion,  and I shall create it anew with the quality of Compassion.”131 128 See e.g. Bereshit rabah, 3: 5 (p. 23). 129 For example, according to Bereshit rabah, 1: 3 (p. 24): “All agree that nothing was created on  the first day, so that no one would be able to say: ‘Michael stretched out the southern end  [of the heavens], Gabriel the northern end, and the Lord measured in the middle,’ rather,  ‘I am the Lord who makes all things; who stretches the heavens alone; who spreads abroad  the earth by myself ’ [Isa. 44: 24]. ‘By myself ’ – who was my partner in the creation of the  world?” The same idea is probably at the basis of the view that the divine name ehyeh (היהא)  is an acronym of the phrase “Lord of all, I created all” (“Sefer otiyot deRabi ‛Aqiva,” in  Wertheimer, Batei midrashot, 2:364). 130 Wertheimer, Batei midrashot, 2:429. 131 “Sefer otiyot deRabi ‛Aqiva,” ibid., 364. LX The Archaeology of  the Zohar </page> <page sequence="53"> 2.6 The Thirteen (§§7, 8, 37) Who is, or are, “the Thirteen” who reinstate the six that were destroyed?  The short version provides few details about this recondite entity, which  apparently comprises thirteen distinct aspects. It stands to reason that  ontologically, it exists above the entities it “raises” from destruction and thus  it must be the same one referred to as both YHVH and “the beginning,”  the only one that survived the destruction of the other six. The “Thirteen”  must therefore be identified with it. From §7 we learn that the Thirteen  are “thirteen of glory,” which seems to refer to God’s glory, and from §8  we learn that this entity acts “with Compassion.” The long version offers no clue as to the nature of the “thirteen of  glory” mentioned only in the short version. According to the long version,  there is a Head in the supernal world, desired by all, which prepares for  itself certain “garments of glory” (§4). These comprise seven garments (or  enhancements) for its skull, such as the hair on its head or the nostrils  of its nose (§6), as well as the thirteen curls of its beard, which are the  choicest of its “garments” and its most glorious enhancements (§§14-17).  This is presented as a condition of the renewal of the creation, a condition  that is not mentioned at all in the short version (§4). Since, moreover, the  motif of the Head and its enhancements is altogether absent from the short  version, whose decipherment does not seem to depend on it in any way,  there is no reason to assume that it was ever a part of the short version,  even though it subsequently became central to all the commentaries on SD,  forming the basis of both Idras and featuring prominently in the doctrines  of such illustrious kabbalists as Moses Cordovero and Isaac Luria. What, then, does the short version make of the Thirteen? It would  be helpful in this connection to consider the two main appearances of  the number thirteen in the rabbinic sources that undoubtedly predate the  Zohar.132 These are the thirteen principles of biblical exegesis, and the  thirteen attributes of God based on Exodus 34: 6-7. However, the link  between either version of Sifra ditseniʽ uta and the thirteen principles of  biblical exegesis is at best tenuous,133 while there is more scope for linking  them to the thirteen attributes of God, if only because, as a description  of the creation, Sifra ditseniʽ uta is likely to refer to the nature of God and  His benevolence as creator. Furthermore, in §7, the “thirteen” are referred  to by the term “glory” (kavod), which occurs in the biblical introduction  to the enumeration of the thirteen attributes of God (Exod. 33: 17 ff.): 132 This is in line with the methodology presented in section 2.1 above. 133 See n. 69 above. LXI Ronit  Meroz </page> <page sequence="54"> [33: 18] And he [Moses] said: “I beg you, show me your glory.” [33: 19] And He [the Lord] said, “I will cause my goodness to pass  before you, and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before you; I  will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show compassion  to whom I will show compassion.” [34: 5] And the Lord descended in the cloud, and stood with him  there, and proclaimed the name of the Lord. [34: 6] And the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed, “The  Lord, The Lord God, compassionate and gracious, long suffering, and  abundant in mercy...” It is possible, therefore, that on the basis of this Biblical text, the short  version identifies the thirteen attributes with the term “glory,” as well as  with God’s compassionate modes of action. Moreover, there is an allusion  in the long version (§18) to the prayers for the month of Tishrei, where  these thirteen attributes are frequently mentioned, and Tishrei is traditionally  considered to be the month in which the world was created.134 Thus, it seems that both the long and the short version of SD implicitly  identify the “thirteen of glory” with the thirteen attributes derived from  the verses in Exodus. This runs counter to the idea that became fixed in  the commentaries on SD, beginning with the Idra raba, that there are two  sets of thirteen divine attributes: the thirteen attributes of compassion that  derive from Micah 7: 18-20, which are associated with the higher divine  entity, and which the Idra raba calls “Arikh Anpin” (the Long-Faced One),  and the thirteen attributes of both compassion and judgement, derived  from Exodus 34, which are associated with the lower divine entity known  as “Ze’ir Anpin” (the Small-Faced One).135 2.7 Creation and failure again: the luminaries (§13) We have learnt that the heavens and the earth, as well as some other  entities, were all created, destroyed, and created anew. But were peace and  stability thus restored to the creation? It seems that not:it seems that the  world continues to alternate between episodes of destruction and restoration.  One of these episodes, which is hinted at without being explicitly described,  is the creation of the luminaries in the heavens by God, who is referred  to as Elohim, namely, the quality of Judgement, associated with the female  (§13). According to rabbinic legends on the “diminution of the moon,”  134 BT RH 10b. 135 See e.g. Zohar 3:131b (Idra raba). LXII The Archaeology of  the Zohar </page> <page sequence="55"> when the two luminaries were first created they were equally bright, but  in response to the moon’s discontentment with this parity, God punished  her by diminishing her light. Since then, the two luminaries, referred to  as the male sun and the female moon, are no longer equal, although their  parity will be restored in the messianic future.136 SD briefly alludes to this legend and the calamity associated with  it, when it claims (in both versions) that the creation of the luminaries  by Elohim alone, namely, by a divine name which is identified with the  quality of Judgement, results in a flawed state of affairs, in which the male  dominates the female. Two paradigmatic parallels can be discerned between  this episode and the earlier one depicting the creation of the six primordial  entities: it appears that in both cases, the creative force of Judgement has  not been tempered with Compassion, so that in both cases, the creation  inevitably results in a failure – the destruction of the six entities in the  first, and the diminution of the moon in the second. 2.8 The supernal Adam (§§19, 20, 26, 36, 44, 61-2) After the heavens and the earth are renewed, they (as the counterparts  of the supernal beings – YHVH and Elohim) give birth to “a man” (adam)  or, more accurately, the supernal man, Adam (§44). The supernal Adam  is “complete” because he is created by a “complete” name: “And YHVH  Elohim created Adam” (Gen. 2: 7; §20; see also §§36, 44). His completeness  distinguishes him from his earthly counterpart and can be explained by the  co-operation of his two progenitors: “YHVH – the male side; Elohim – the  female side” (§44). The supernal Adam is also called “Ze’ir” (“the Small  One”), while his creator, referred to by the complete name YHVH Elohim,  is also known as “Atiqa Satim” (“the Concealed Ancient One”), from which  we can deduce that the radical anthropomorphic tradition so evident in the  long version is already discernible in the short version as well,137 and that  both versions draw on the “Daniel tradition” incorporated into the Zohar.  However, here, too, not everything is straightforward. At the very beginning of the process that culminated in the creation of  the supernal Adam, Elohim commanded the Mother, “earth,” to bring forth  her “seed,” that is, her progeny: “Elohim said ‘Let the earth sprout vegetation:  plants yielding seed of each kind’” etc. (Gen. 1: 11; long version, §19).  Indeed, the earth does precisely this – ”And the earth sprouted [vegetation:  136 BT Ḥul. 60b. 137 If indeed the short version is earlier than the longer one than it is not impossible, however,  that these anthropomorphic terms were added to the short version at a later stage of recension.  LXIII Ronit  Meroz </page> <page sequence="56"> plants yielding seed of each kind]” (Gen. 1: 12, §26). However, this does not  happen immediately. At first, the earth “swarmed,” and “in this swarming  of the earth [the name of God] is incomplete” (§19 in the long version.  That is to say, the swarming results from Elohim’s action alone rather than  from action by the complete name, YHVH Elohim. The earth produces seed,  but it is infertile – a “swarming” whose progeny are of limited viability.1 38  In other words, the female earth gives birth without union with her male  partner – the heavens, and for this reason her progeny are flawed, or rather,  “incomplete.” She manages to produce viable seed only “when the Name  was planted” (§26), a process on which §36 provides further details:  “And the earth sprouted vegetation: plants yielding seed of each  kind, and trees bearing fruit that has its seed within it of each kind”  (Gen. 1: 12). These were uprooted from the complete name and were  planted after [that is: under] the complete name, as Scripture says:  “YHVH Elohim planted” (Gen. 2: 8).1 39 §20 offers a similar description: רצייו (vayitser), “and He formed” (Gen. 2: 7) – the totality of  completeness was uprooted from this place, this name, and planted  in another, as Scripture says: “YHVH Elohim planted [a garden in  Eden]” (Gen. 2: 8).140 The view that without a male partner, the female is capable of giving birth,  but only to flawed progeny, is not unique to SD. It is based, in general  terms, on Aristotle’s opinion that without the contribution of male semen,  a woman would give birth to a formless child, a lump of unformed matter.  This notion was probably based on the medical observation of the expulsion  138 This might mean that the “earth” does not unite with her partner at all, or that instead of  uniting with her rightful partner, she unites with the forces of evil. Cf. the description of  Adam and Eve as quoted in n. 71 above. 139 Note that this verse refers to the planting of the Garden of Eden, which is identified here  with the creation of man. This is evident also in the description of the actions of the “fallen  ones” as the rivers which flow down from Eden. See nn.77 above. 140 See Bereshit rabah 12: 5 (p. 100): “’And the earth sprouted’ [Gen. 1: 12] – that was commanded  of her.” Our text assumes that this was indeed commanded of the earth but not immediately  fulfilled. See also Bereshit rabah 15: 1: “’And YHVH Elohim planted a garden eastward in  Eden’ [Gen. 2: 8] ... the full name is mentioned ... they were like locust’s horns, and the  Lord uprooted them and planted them in the Garden of Eden.”  LXIV The Archaeology of  the Zohar </page> <page sequence="57"> from the womb of various pathological growths, and on the analogy to  chickens laying eggs. It was accompanied by the belief that a man is capable  of giving form to the infant even after its birth, by providing it with the  warmth required to turn it from a lump of matter into a whole being. Many  of the Gnostic traditions rely on these medical opinions, postulating, for  example, that Sophia wanted to give birth without a partner to a replica  of herself, but the fruit of her womb, Yaldabaoth, was indeed born formless  and incomplete; it could achieve completion only with the intervention of  a complete male figure.141 To return to our text: the new progeny is mentioned for the first time  in verses 11-12 of Genesis chapter 1, a chapter which stands entirely under  the sign of the name Elohim, and which according to SD, is the sign of  a flawed, incomplete creation. The rectification of the flaw, the renewal of  this creation, and the restoration of the divine name to completion occur  only at a later stage, described in the second chapter of Genesis. There,  in Genesis 2: 8, we learn, according to SD, that the seed is torn out of  the complete name, or rather, out of its female element – the earth – to  be appropriately planted in a new place. Simply put – birth now takes  place through the union between the male and the female elements of  the creator; in the course of this process, the seed of the female is “torn  out,” that is, born, and is planted in the world, where it can achieve viable  existence in wholeness, without blemish. The supernal Adam, like the  other two primordial entities, the heavens and the earth – his father and  his mother – similarly undergoes a process of destruction and renewal. In  all these cases, the destruction does not signify complete annihilation but  rather a fall; thus it was in relation to the six primordial entities that fell  and were raised by the Thirteen (section 2.4), thus it was in relation to  the diminution of the moon (section 2.7), and thus we will shortly see it  again below (section 2.9). In light of all this, §44 of the short version is of particular interest: “Elohim said, ‘Let us make adam [a man]’” (Gen. 1: 26). The verse  does not say ha’adam [the man], but just adam [a man] – excluding  the supernal [Adam], who was made with the complete name. And  141 See Thomas Laqueur, Making Sex: Body and Gender from the Greeks to Freud (Cambridge,  Mass., Harvard University Press, 1990), 1-62; Richard Smith, “Sex Education in Gnostic  Schools,” in Karen L. King (ed.), Images of the Feminine in Gnosticism (Philadelphia: Fortress  Press, 1988). In this context one could also mention the Greek goddess Nyx who similarly  gave birth without a partner, and her progeny was marked by detrimental characteristics;  she gave birth, for instance, to death, sleep, and the like (see Hesiod, Theogony). LXV Ronit  Meroz </page> <page sequence="58"> when this [name] was completed, that [Adam] was completed, YHVH  – the male side; Elohim – the female side. The male extended and  was arrayed with His enhancements, with the phallus (amma) in the  mouth of the Mother (imma). The kings who had been ruined were  here established. Previously, we had learnt that the mother’s “seed” was wasted, namely, that  she “swarmed” rather than giving birth to complete beings. Now we find  that the father’s attempt at creation was also flawed, for until now, he had  not placed his member “in the mouth” of his female partner, implying that  he, too, had wasted his seed.  If we compare this formulation with what is stated in §51, it  becomes clear that here, too, loss of seed does not mean total annihilation,  but rather a flawed existence. In §51, Adam’s sin is said to have produced  disembodied progeny, and it seems that this refers to the creation of demons,  who are traditionally defined as disembodied beings.142 If we return to §3, we realize that this problem has already been defined  at the very beginning of SD: “For until there was a balance, they did not  gaze face-to-face.” If the the divine couple did not “gaze face-to-face,”  it is almost certain that they were standing back to back, very likely in  accordance with the rabbinic version of the Platonic myth of the androgyne.143  The result of this state of affairs is described in §3 – ”the primordial kings  (that is, the first entities to be created) were dead, and their weapons did not  exist”; namely, the union between the male and the female was irregular and  therefore infertile. In §44, on the other hand, a proper union is described,  and thus, the “kings who had been ruined were here established.” In light  of what has been said until now, the “weapons” (which “did not exist”)  would seem to be a euphemism for the infertile semen of the “primordial  kings,” while the “kings ... who were here established” are the sustainable  progeny of the properly united male and female, here to be understood as  a reference to the supernal Adam.144 142 See Pirqei avot, ch. 5, and a few places in the Zohar, e.g. Zohar 1:19b; ZH 17a (Midrash  haneʽelam, “Bereshit”); Benayahu, Maʽamadot umoshavot, passim. 143 See Plato, Symposium (Stephanus edn.), 189-93; Bereshit rabah 8: 11 (p. 55), and elsewhere. 144 At the same time, it seems that the “kings” are a symbolic name for the letters of the alphabet,  as in Sefer yetsirah (Sefer yeṣira: edition, translation and text-critical commentary, ed. and trans.  by A. Peter Hayman (Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2004), §41), for according to SD, the process  of creation can be described as the formation of the letters. See Liebes, Torat hayetsirah,  137-8. LXVI The Archaeology of  the Zohar </page> <page sequence="59"> 2.9 The Terrestrial man and his progeny (§§38, 44, 48-51, 63, 65) The terrestrial man, too, was created flawed, since he was the product of  action taken by the name Elohim on its own. This view is anchored in the  verse “Elohim said, ‘Let us make adam [a man]’” (Gen. 1: 26), on which SD  comments (§44): “a man,” not “the man,” to distinguish between the supernal  Adam and the terrestrial man. A little further, the Scriptural narrative again  ascribes the creation of adam to Elohim: “On the day when Elohim created  adam, in the likeness of Elohim He made him; male and female He created  them” (Gen. 5: 1-2). Although adam and his partner were created “male and  female” from the outset, they were created by Elohim alone, and therefore,  together they constitute only an “image and countenance like adam sitting  on a throne” (§48), that is, not an adam but only a likeness of adam. This  might be another reference to this adam’s androgynous form – male and  female back to back, which is incapable of proper sexual union. Be that as  it may, for this reason, adam is “hidden ... concealed by letters which are  not settled in His places,” “for [as regards] Him – neither those above nor  those below settle within Him” (§49). A creation of this inherent instability  does not bode well, and indeed, the events described in all the subsequent  books of the Hebrew Bible (as well as the reality in which we live to this  day), suggest that the “restoration” of man is yet to be completed. SD presents two additional, alternative descriptions of the creation of the  terrestrial man. According to the first (§62), he was not created ex nihilo, but  is, in fact, none other than the “fallen” supernal Adam. This is deduced from  the verse “You set Your palm upon me” (Ps. 139: 5, §62), which was taken  by the rabbis to be a reference to the diminution of Adam as a consequence  of his sin.145 Indeed, §51 explicitly mentions a time “when the lower Adam  descended in the supernal image,” referring to the descent of the supernal  Adam, who then became known as the “terrestrial man,” but who, despite his  fall, was still fashioned in the “supernal image.” An alternative formulation of  the same idea occurs in §54: “Two were embracing above [as the supernal  Adam was by nature both male and female]; they descended below, inheriting  dust. They lost the good share that they had possessed.” This suggests that the  supernal Adam had sinned, although the nature of his sin is not explained.  Based on the parallels with other passages mentioned above, the sin was  probably sexual, perhaps union with supernal entities of a destructive nature.146  145 See n. 75 above. 146 Cf. Isaac Hakohen, “Ma’amar ʽal ha’atsilut hasemalit,” in Gershom Scholem, Qabalot  Rabi Ya’aqov veRabi Yitsḥaq benei Rabi Ya’aqov hakohen ( Jerusalem: Makhon le-madaʽe  ha-Yahadut, 1927), 82-102 [=Madaʽei hayahudut, 2 (1937), 243-64], 94-5. LXVII Ronit  Meroz </page> <page sequence="60"> This sin had caused his father, the Concealed Ancient One, to deny him the  breath of the spirit of life, and to transfer it instead to the terrestrial man  (§61), which entailed a diminution of the “light” that could have sustained  the supernal Adam in life for “ten thousand years.” That light now gradually  diminished until it reached the level of the “one hundred and twenty years”  allotted to the terrestrial man (§§61-2), permitting him only a faltering and  temporary physical existence. The second alternative description of the creation of the terrestrial man  similarly refers to the descent of Adam as a “fall,” but now he is portrayed  as one of the “fallen” (nefilim).147 Recall that the creation of supernal man  was described above as the planting of the Garden of Eden ,148 and hence  the text now associates the rivers flowing away from the garden – ”From  there it divides and becomes four riverheads” (Gen. 2: 10) – with the  “fallen ones” who separated from the supernal Adam and the garden by  “falling” away from him (§63). Moreover, the “fallen ones” are excluded  from the general category of adam (humanity), that is, from the wholeness  that is inherent in “man,” for they conduct themselves by the same Holy  Name by which the “unholy ones below conduct themselves” (§§63, 65).149  The identity of this divine name is alluded to in the long version of §65,  which states categorically that it is not YHVH. But the overall discussion  in any case implies that the name in question must be Elohim, which is  again held to be responsible for the flaw that marks all that it creates.  Now according to Genesis 6, the “fallen ones” were the products of sexual  transgression, which SD identifies with the sin of the supernal Adam. Yet  here, we have these “fallen ones” associated with an altogether different type  of transgression – the inappropriate use of holy names, which is one of the  perennial pitfalls on the path of the mystic. As a consequence of all this, “man” now dwells “below,” as a fallen  being, flawed from his very conception, and it is not long before another  calamity befalls him: “The serpent copulated with the female, and a nest  was constructed within her, to become an evil abode, as Scripture says:  ‘She conceived and bore ןיק [Cain]’ [Gen. 4: 1] – אניק [qinna, a nest] of  habitation of evil spirits was constructed in this adam” (§46). The sexual  aspect of the sin, veiled in the events described earlier, now appears more  clearly. Moreover, “When the lower Adam descended in the supernal image,  147 This is suggested by a parallel to our text, cited in section 2.12 below. Without this parallel,  it would have been necessary to identify the fallen ones with Adam’s descendants, though  the characteristics of the sin would still stand as described. 148 See n. 139 above. 149 See also n.77 above. LXVIII The Archaeology of  the Zohar </page> <page sequence="61"> two spirits were found on [his] two sides, right and left. Adam comprises,  on the right, [a] holy neshamah [spirit]; on the left, [a] nefesh ḥayah [a  living or an animal soul]” (§51). The term nefesh ḥayah seems to betray the  influence of the Aristotelian concept of the inferior “sensitive” or “animal”  soul (see also §50). Thus, not only was Adam’s conception flawed, but so  was the process by which his “animal soul” was created: “Elohim said, ‘Let  the waters swarm with a swarm of nefesh ḥayah’ (Gen. 1: 20; §§38, 50).” The  time was not long in coming, therefore, when he, too, would sin, as did his  female partner: “When Adam sinned, the left spread” (§51). This statement  is immediately followed by “and those without a body spread,” which  seems to allude to the sexual sin of “spilt seed” from which disembodied  demons are traditionally believed to come into being.150 As in all the earlier  descriptions of the process of creation, here, too, the process fails, resulting  in the creation of evil spirits and demons, which fall into the category of  the inherently flawed, “fallen” beings. Out of the generations that followed the “terrestrial man,” Sifra ditseniʽ uta  mentions only one figure – Enoch. His life, too, is flawed by a distinctly  negative trait, for “Enoch walked with Elohim,” that is, like the “fallen  ones,” he conducted himself by the power of the wrong divine name,  the “incomplete” name Elohim, which is associated with the unmitigated  attribute of Judgement. For this reason, he did not come to a good end,  “For Elohim took him” (Gen. 5: 24, §69), which seems to be a reference  to actual death rather than a rectifiable “fall.” 151 2.10 Revelation and concealment (§§12, 30-2, 49) We return to the study of §12, which deals with the six entities that were  destroyed and renewed: “Six emerge from the thickness of the root of the  body, a tongue [which is] speaking [after Dan. 7: 8], a tongue which is  concealed between [the letters] yod and heh.” 150 See n. 142 above. 151 This is a negative view of Enoch’s end, which does not accord either with the positive  evaluation of Enoch in the biblical text or with the esoteric-mystical tradition about Enoch’s  apotheosis, but it is consistent with the evaluation of Enoch in a number of classical rabbinic  sources, e.g. Bereshit rabah 25: 1 (pp. 238-9). See Annette Y. Reed, Fallen Angels and the  History of Judaism and Christianity (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2005), esp.  136-40. However, the long version of SD adds here a fragment of a verse from Prov. 22.6:  “ḥanokh lana’ar (train the youth) [according to his way],” which it associates with the esoteric  doctrine of Enoch as a youth, hinting at his celestial role as a ministering angel. This gloss  seems to introduce into the long version’s view of Enoch a positive note which is at odds  with Enoch’s negative portrayal in the short version. LXIX Ronit  Meroz </page> <page sequence="62"> How do these new entities emerge? A tongue that is hidden and  unknown (could it be the tongue of the Lord, which commanded the  creation by “Let there be” etc.?) is said to be articulating new letters, which  had previously been concealed between the letters yod and heh but which are  now emerging from potentiality into actuality. The echoes of Neoplatonic  thought are discernible, at least implicitly, in both the terminology and the  very concepts of concealment and revelation; these are philosophical notions,  though they have been profoundly mythologized. Note that it is specifically  the concept of revelation to which a degree of ambivalence is attached: while  the revelation, namely, the existence of the creation, is presumably held to  be desirable, nevertheless, negative connotations arise from the evocation in  this context of the beast “speaking arrogantly” of Daniel 7: 8. As in Neoplatonic thought, the concealed is a transcendent source  of existence, which lies beyond human perception. This is why its name,  YHVH, should not be pronounced. Thus it is known – according to the  long version (§30) – by the allusive Hebrew demonstrative pronoun Hu,  which has become one of his other personal names: Scripture says: “I am YHVH, Hu [literally – ‘that’] is my name” [Isa.  42: 8]... Hu – designates one who is concealed and not found. Hu−one who is not visible to the eye. Hu−one who is not called by name... From this paragraph it appears that the concepts of concealment and  revelation are not only ontological but also (as in Neoplatonic thought)  epistemological. The concealed is that which is invisible to the eye and lies  beyond human perception, while the revealed is in plain sight. SD relies not only on philosophical traditions but also, and in this  context, primarily on the myth of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet. It  presents the emergence of all existence from potentiality into actuality as  the emergence of the letters one from another – flowing into one another,  joining up and splitting apart, to create new combinations of letters. Thus,  for instance, we read in §31 of the long version: “א goes to ףלא;  ףלא goes  to דוי  ;דוי goes to י – the concealed of all concealed, which is not joined  by ד  ו.”152 To the extent that this odd sentence is at all decipherable, it  seems to say that a letter becomes fully revealed when its name is spelled  out in full, namely, when each of the constituent letters of its name is  152 See nn. 57-59 above. LXX The Archaeology of  the Zohar </page> <page sequence="63"> written out. Thus the letter י (y) is fully revealed only when its three-letter  name is spelled out as דוי (yod), and so on. Notably, the concealment of the  letter which has not had its name spelled out in full does not mean that  it has not altogether emerged from potentiality into actuality, for surely, its  concealed one-letter form already exists in actuality. Its concealment, put  in Neoplatonic terms, is the withdrawal of its “light,” as is indicated by  the exclamation: “Woe when י does not illumine ד,  ו!” (the long version  of §31).153 When the link between the “concealed” י and the remaining  two letters that make up its full name, ד,  ו, is broken “through the sins  of the world,” the י remains revealed, namely, exposed. The result of this  process is now described in sexual rather than abstract terms: once the  concealing entities have withdrawn, “the nakedness of all appears” (§32 in  both versions). The creation is thus flawed by “the exposure of nakedness”  (giluy arayot),154 which results not only from the flaws that are inherent in  the deity itself, as SD consistently claims, but also from man’s sinful conduct  (§32 in both versions). Thus, creation – the emergence of existence from potentiality to actuality  – amounts to the emergence of existence from concealment to revelation,  concealment having been effected by the very letters that now emerge  from it into revelation: “revealed in the letters [with which] it is written;  concealed and sealed by the letters” (§49 in the long version). Once the  existent has emerged from potentiality to actuality and become revealed, it  can neither revert to its previous state of concealment nor remain totally  exposed; rather it must “cover” and conceal itself again. The uncovering of an  existent formed out of the Hebrew letters that cover and conceal it, namely,  the rending asunder of the dense fabric of language that forms the creation,  is an “exposure of nakedness” and counts as “forbidden sexual relations.” The immense tension discernible in SD between concealment and  153 See also §49. 154 The term traditionally refers to forbidden sexual relations. For some of the late-medieval  discussions on this topic, especially in Kabbalah, see Tishby, The Wisdom of the Zohar, 3:1367- 9; Ephraim Gottlieb, Haqabalah bekhitvei Rabenu Baḥya ben Asher ( Jerusalem: Kiryat Sepher,  1970), 75-6, 238; Ellion R.

LXXI Ronit  Meroz </page> <page sequence="64"> revelation is also evident in its account of human action: on the one hand,  human sin plunges the creation into a state of illicit “exposure,” but on the  other hand, it is human action that has the power to rectify this through  the appropriate use of holy names by the mystics who have mastered the  doctrine of the alphabet. Thus, in order to preserve the “modesty” of the  concealed existent, it is necessary to be in possession of highly esoteric  knowledge. As a rule, SD seems to move back and forth from one mode of discourse  to another, across three distinct domains, which it takes to be analogous by  dint of sharing the same built-in polarity: when it adopts the ontological  mode of discourse, it discerns this polarity between the overt and actual  versus the covert and potential nature of existence; when it switches to  the epistemological mode, it finds the polarity in the tension between  revelation and concealment; and in the sexual mode of discourse, it points  to the polarity of “exposure” versus modesty. The easy movement back and  forth between the ontological and the epistemological mode are facilitated  by the common vehicle of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet, but in order  to integrate the sexual mode into this structure of analogous domains, the  letters of the alphabet must be anthropomorphized and invested with gender. 2.11 The Balance The motif of the balance appears in the short version with little explanatory  detail. The context suggests that it was introduced in order to describe  how the male and female unite by being balanced on the two pans of the  scales. Yehuda Liebes has already pointed out a number of precedents for  this idea.155 One of them is the reference, in an Aramaic liturgical poem  originating in Byzantine Palestine, to “perfect pairs ... from your mother’s  womb were you both weighed ... blessed is he who united you, a union of  the balance scales ... bride with groom.”156 Isaac the Blind, too, uses the  Hebrew root ל-ק-ש (shin-quf-lamed), meaning “weigh” or “balance,” in just  the same way.157 The theme of the balance is universally associated with  justice and human morality,158 but in our text, it is linked to sexuality –  155 Liebes, “Peraqim bemilon Sefer hazohar,” 327-32; id., “How the Zohar Was Written,” 103-119;  id., Torat hayetsirah, 133-4. For an additional aspect of this weighing, see at n. 183 below. 156 Michael Sokoloff and Joseph Yahalom, Shirat benei ma’arava: shirim aramiyim shel yehudei  erets-Yisra’el batequfah habizantit ( Jerusalem: Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities,  1999), 272-3, and see also 258-9. 157 Isaac the Blind’s commentary on Sefer yetsira, in: Scholem, Haqabalah biProvans, appendix 9. 158 See e.g. Lev. 19: 35-6; Deut. 25: 12-16; Hosea 12: 8; Amos 8: 2; Prov. 11: 1; and particularly  Job 6: 2, 36: 1. LXXII The Archaeology of  the Zohar </page> <page sequence="65"> either licit or illicit, and possibly also to the question of the sexual purity  of the copulating couple. The same motif is more fully developed in the long version, which is  valuable not only in its own right but also because it demonstrates how  the additional material that found its way into this version has given it an  enigmatic, poetic, and visual form of its own. §4, which appears only in  the long version, reads as follows: Until the head, the most desired of all that is desired, arranged and  bestowed [with] garments of glory, this balance hung in a place that  was not; weighed upon it were those who did not exist. The balance  stands by itself, it is not held and it is not seen. Upon it rose and  upon it rise159 those who were not,160 those who were, and those  who will be. According to the opening lines of the two versions, the primordial kings  died because of the flawed, androgynous state of their parents, “who did not  gaze face-to-face” (§3 and section 2.8 above). The short version returns to  this topic only in §44, in the context of the descendants of the “supernal  Adam,” also known as the “Small One” (Ze’ir; §§61-2). But the long version  seems to return to the topic much sooner, in §4, where it refers to the six  entities that were destroyed at an earlier stage as “kings” (see section 2.4).  The identification of the dead kings with the destroyed entities signals a  turning point in the development of this theme, as the entire literature of  the Idras, and all the later kabbalists, such as Moses Cordovero, Isaac Luria,  and the Gaon of Vilna, who based their interpretations of SD on the Idras,  identified the six entities with the kings as a matter of course. The key to understanding §44 is the realization that the scales envisaged  here consist of two pans suspended from a horizontal beam moving freely  on a central fulcrum. Scales of this type must be supported, either by resting  on a fixed base or by being held in the hand; when they are not supported,  they simply cannot fulfil their function.161 According to the long version, the  159 They first “rose upon” the scales in the past, when the scales were unstable, and they “rise  upon them” again now that they have achieved stability, since the “head” has been enhanced. 160 That is, those who were weighed at first, before the scales were stabilized, did not endure. 161 On the scales as an instrument and their symbolic connotations, see e.g. Entsiqlopedyah  miqra’it: otsar hayediʽot al hamiqra utequfato ( Jerusalem: Bialik Institute, 1950-1988), iv., cols.  540-3, s.v. moznayim; Encyclopaedia Judaica, ed. Michael Berenbaum and Fred Skolnik, 2nd  edn. (Detroit: Thomson Gale/ McMillan Reference USA, 2007), 3:183, s.v. “balance,” and  xx. 700-9, s.v. “weights and measures”; Encyclopaedia of Islam, ed. P. J. Bearman, et al., 2nd  LXXIII Ronit  Meroz </page> <page sequence="66"> scales were supposed to be supported by the supernal “head” – ”the most  desired of all that is desired,” which corresponds here to the top of the base  supporting and stabilizing the scales. For as long as this base, together with  its “head,” were not suitably “arranged,” “this balance hung in a place that  was not,” that is, it was not hung at all, since “it was not held and it was  not seen.” Rather, it “stood by itself,” which means that it was not suitably  supported or hung, and consequently it could not function as a balance.  While it was in that dysfunctional state, “those who were not” were being  weighed in it, but this proved to be futile, as in effect, they could not be  weighed at all and thus did not achieve existence. Only when the scales  were properly hung were the other “kings” weighed in the balance, and this  time they did achieve existence. The motif of the scales seems to preserve its original context of licit and  illicit, enduring and unsustainable, sexual unions, but this context is gradually  subsumed in the visual imagery of the balance, which becomes independent  of the sexual imagery embedded in it, and ultimately displaces it altogether. The motif of the scales can also be viewed as belonging in the biblical  tradition of wisdom literature, where God the creator is often depicted as  an architect or a builder, who creates by way of measuring or weighing each  of his creations. Thus, for instance, Isaiah 40: 12 reads: “Who has measured  the waters in the hollow of his hand, and marked out the heavens with a  span, and enclosed the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the  mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?” From this point of view,  it is possible to present SD’s view of the cycles of creation and destruction  as reflecting God’s fluctuating ability to make proper use of His utensils:  at times He cannot “hang” His scales as required and they lie slack and  ineffective, while at other times He manages to stabilize them and proceeds  to effect an unblemished creation.

LXXIV The Archaeology of  the Zohar </page> <page sequence="67"> created world are therefore a reflection of God’s own shortcomings in using  His own utensils and thus – as a creator! In the subsequent paragraphs of the long version, the motif of the  balance moves further away from its original context as preserved by the  short version, where concerns with birth and sexual morality are expressed  in terms of weighing the “parental” couple. In the long version, on the other  hand, the balance mostly weighs the letters of the alphabet of creation  against each other. Thus, for example, the creation of light in the verse  “Elohim said, ‘יהי [let there be] light!’ יהיו [and there was] light” (Gen. 1:  3) is described as balancing the letters of “let there be” on one pan of the  scales, against the letters of “and there was” on the opposite pan. And in  order to create the Shekhinah (rather than for her to unite with her male  partner, as in the short version), the letter heh (which has the numerical  value of five and is one of the Shekhinah’s common symbols) is cast on  both pans of the scales at the same time. Thus the Shekhinah comes into  being and is now symbolized by the letter yod, which has the numerical  value of ten, combining the two fives of the two letters heh which had been  cast upon both pans of the scales (§10).162 2.12 Sifra Ditseniʽuta and Midrash Haneʽelam All the extant sources of the short version of SD integrate it into Midrash  haneʽelam. This suggests that at least in part, it may have originated in  Midrash haneʽelam and was only subsequently adapted and integrated into  another stratum of the Zohar. A few significant points of similarity between  Midrash haneʽelam and SD would seem to lend support to this hypothesis  and are discussed below, although the full complexity of the issue lies beyond  the scope of the present study. One of the close similarities between SD and Midrash haneʽelam is  evident in their respective interpretations of Genesis 6 – the final chapter  of pericope “Bereshit.” Midrash haneʽelam claims that the source of the flaws  162 The tenth letter of the Hebrew alphabet, yod, which the context here demands, is far from  being a common symbol for the Shekhinah, who is normally symbolized by the letter heh.  But the yod may be linked to it nevertheless on the grounds that, in kabbalistic theosophy, the  Shekhinah is considered to be the tenth Sephirah. The breakdown of the yod’s numerical value  of ten into the two fives of the letter heh, each cast on one pan of the balance scales, supplies  a somewhat contrived harmonization of the two discrepant symbols. The weighing, therefore,  becomes part of a symbolic process that is not ontologically necessary. For additional examples  of the weighing of the letters, see §§22, 52 (which are not included in the present edition  of the text). LXXV Ronit  Meroz </page> <page sequence="68"> observed in the “sons of God” (benei ha’elohim) was that they were “created  by that name,” that is, by the name Elohim. It further claims: The fallen ones [nefilim] ... are Adam and his wife, who fell to earth  without mother or father.1 63 Why are they called “fallen”? Because they  fell from the position that they had, that is, they are reduced from  their former state. They are fallen in that they were driven away from  the Garden of Eden and did not return there ... All creatures feared  them ... and they did not prevent their generation from sinning [by  engaging in illicit sexuality] ... they could prevent themselves from  sinning for their sakes, but they did not, and in their very presence  they [benei ha’elohim] whored with the daughters of men and they  bore them children. This passage goes on to claim, much like SD (§63), that the “fallen ones”  existed until the time of Joshua.164 Moreover, Tishby has already noted the similarity between descriptions  of the soul of man in Midrash haneʽelam and in SD.165 Here (§51) we learn  that Adam possessed two spirits, one on each of his two sides: “Adam  comprises, on the right, [a] holy neshamah [spirit]; on the left, [a] nefesh  ḥayah [a living or an animal soul],” which is considered “the animal within  the category of man.” Similar descriptions occur in Midrash haneʽelam, for  example, in Zohar ḥadash 10c, where the claim is made that, like every  other living creature, man is born with one soul only, his “animal soul,” but  he receives an extra soul – his “holy spirit” – at the age of thirteen. There  follows an intriguing statement, which strengthens the affinity to SD, to the  effect that the reason for this has been explained in “the thirteen attributes  of Compassion within the Matnita [tradition or teaching] of Rabbi Eleazar.”  No work by such a title has come down to us,166 but the statement clearly  163 Adam’s mother and father are similarly mentioned in SD, §§32, 44. See also the discussion  in section 2.8 above. 164 See Zohar ḥadash, 20b (Midrash haneʽelam, “Bereshit”); Meroz, “Va’ani lo hayiti sham?!.”  The reference to Adam’s transformation into a fallen being that all creatures feared might  be an adaptation of the talmudic statement whereby “the n ine hundred and seventy-four  generations who were pressed [that is, destined] to be created before the world was created,  but who were not created – the Holy One, blessed be He, arose and planted them in every  generation, and they are the insolent of each generation” (Ḥag. 13b-14a). 165 See Tishby, The Wisdom of the Zohar, 2:709. Similar claims can be found in the bible  commentaries of Abraham ibn Ezra (on Gen. 1: 20) and Nachmanides (on Gen. 1: 26). 166 See also Tishby’s comments in The Wisdom of the Zohar, 2:725. LXXVI The Archaeology of  the Zohar </page> <page sequence="69"> evokes yet another motif we have already encountered in SD – that of the  thirteen attributes of Compassion. Works referred to by similar titles and  attributed to a similarly named sage are mentioned twice more in Midrash  haneʽelam within Zohar ḥadash: The Matnita of Rabbi Eliezer [sic],167 and  The Ancient Book of the Matnita of Rabbi Eliezer [sic] ben Arakh.168 On  the other hand, in the pericope “Ḥayei sarah,” Rabbi Eleazar discusses the  relation between body and soul according to “that Matnita,” or “as explained  in the thirteen attributes of Compassion” – seemingly a reference to the  same Matnita, attributed to the same Rabbi Eleazar (rather than Eliezer).  Further on in the same pericope, Rabbi Eleazar claims that the secrets of  the “crowns” of the letters, like the secrets of the tefilin, have already been  alluded to, “And the reasons for all these [can be found] in the thirteen  attributes [of Compassion].”169 All these examples suggest that the authors of Midrash haneʽelam had  before them an earlier text, which they attributed to Rabbi Eleazar (or  Eliezer). This text seems to have been similar to the short version of SD  inasmuch as it dealt, among other subjects, with the thirteen attributes of  Compassion and the structure of the soul. It thus seems that not only the  Zohar but even Midrash haneʽelam – one of its components – was itself a  compilation of diverse strata of literary tradition, of which at least some,  such as the Matnita of Rabbi Eleazar (or perhaps Eliezer) retained its  distinct literary identity, and resembled certain elements of SD. Summary and Conclusions The worldview underlying SD is only partially retrievable from the two  extant versions of the work. Ideas and beliefs emerge from these versions  in a disjointed, disorganized, and incomplete manner, rendering them rather  difficult to decipher. Nevertheless, the comparison between them has made  it possible to disentangle and highlight some of the motifs that comprise  them. We have no clear-cut evidence as to which version is earlier, but the  distinct theology that emerges from the present analysis of the short version  would seem to tilt the balance towards the view that it preceded and was  not merely a summary of the longer version. 167 Zohar ḥadash, 13a (Midrash haneʽelam, “Bereshit”). 168 Ibid., 18c (Midrash haneʽelam, “Bereshit”). 169 These examples appear in Zohar 1:124b and 129b (Midrash haneʽelam), “Ḥayei sarah.” The  brackets enclosing the final “of Compassion” appear in the Margaliot edition and signify  that not all the witnesses to the text include these words. LXXVII Ronit  Meroz </page> <page sequence="70"> According to the short version, at the head of the chain of being stands  the divine Glory; it has thirteen aspects corresponding to the thirteen  attributes of Compassion based on Exodus 34. This Glory is identified  with both the divine name YHVH and the Hebrew word be-reshit (“in the  beginning”). From “in the beginning” emerged six other entities, including  Elohim, the heavens, and the earth, all of which “fell” and were destroyed  within thirteen hours, while YHVH alone – the entity that brought them  all into existence – remained “elevated” in splendid isolation. Subsequently,  the six “fallen” entities arose and were restored to their former state of  existence through the “Compassion” of “the Thirteen.” These assertions  suggest some resemblance to Gnostic ideas about the creation whereby the  divine creator (YHVH in SD) gives rise to an inherently flawed creation,  but the resemblance ends with the SD’s notion that the same creator is also  the source of the Compassion that ensures the “renewal” of the creation  and establishes a sustainable world. The short version displays no awareness of kabbalistic theosophy and  the concept of the sefirot, nor any indication that Sefer yetsirah – the  foundational text of the kabbalistic tradition – was familiar to its authors.  It draws on a range of literary works of various times of composition,  up to and including, perhaps especially, the geonic period. In addition, it  betrays some acquaintance with Neoplatonic doctrines and the Aristotelian  concept of the “animal soul.” But all this does not enable us to determine  with any precision or certainty when the text might have been composed,  or whether – as I suggested tentatively – the short version might have  preceded its long counterpart. In contrast, according to the long version, the godhead comprises a  hierarchy of emanated divine entities. In other words, there is evidence  here that the authors were acquainted with the kabbalistic theosophy of  the sefirot, which in turn suggests that they would have been aware also of  Sefer yetsirah. At the top of this hierarchy of entities stands the “Head” –  “the most desired of all that is desired,” who corresponds to the top of the  base supporting the balance scales. The short version’s characterization of  this supreme entity as the divine Glory is so marginal in the long version’s  account as to be barely discernible, and to the best of my knowledge,  none of the Zohar commentators have ever remarked on it. Following  the destruction of the first six entities that lie beneath it, this entity is  enhanced by being clothed in “garments of glory” (seven “enhancements” of  the skull and thirteen “enhancements” of the beard), after which, thirteen  emanations emerge from it and renew the entities that were destroyed.  Notably, most of the commentators on SD, beginning with those whose  LXXVIII The Archaeology of  the Zohar </page> <page sequence="71"> work was incorporated in the Zohar itself, have taken the entities that were  destroyed and renewed to be seven (sic!) sefirot. As we have seen, the short version reflects familiarity with traditional  doctrines on the letters of the Hebrew alphabet, but in the long version,  these doctrines are vastly expanded; the anthropomorphic character of the  letters is highlighted and their creative function acquires a major role, so  that the whole creation is presented as the product of the proliferation of  letters by way of flowing in and out of each other, joining together and  separating again as they bring the world into existence. In spite of the state of disorganization that marks the short version, a  thread can be discerned running through it, providing a relatively coherent  focus. This is the distinction between the three biblical creation narratives.  The first narrative is hinted at in the first verse of the Book of Genesis;  in this early stage of the creative process, three entities, Elohim, the earth  and the heavens, were created by YHVH but became desolate. The second  narrative (Gen. 1 and its sequel in Gen. 5), where Elohim is the only active  agent, describes a flawed creation whose progeny are equally defective or  “fallen.” The third narrative (Gen 2 and 3), in which YHVH Elohim is the  active agent, describes the renewal and restoration of this creation to its  rightful place. The centrality of the notions of “falling” and “rising” invests  the short version, once more, with a somewhat Gnostic flavor. All the motifs of “falling” and “rising” appear also in the long version,  but they are not as central to it or as distinctive as in the short version,  not only on account of the patchwork character of this version, but also  because it is dominated by two themes, which are not compatible with the  concepts of falling and rising. One of these is the myth of the configuration  of the divine countenances, and the other the doctrine of the letters of the  alphabet, which are taken to be representations of man, for even though  they are not described in terms of human form as such, they are invested  with gender and said to multiply sexually, just like humans.170 Moreover,  in the transition from the short version to the long, the Gnostic element  is obscured, while the kabbalistic theosophy, comprising both Neoplatonic  and anthropomorphic features, becomes much more pronounced. The short version alludes to a range of reasons for the world’s “fall”:  the first creations were unbalanced, as they were formed by one quality  alone – either the quality of Judgement or the quality of Compassion –  without the mitigating influence of one upon the other; they were marred  by various, mostly sexual, transgressions – a female giving birth without  170 see, for example, §26. LXXIX Ronit  Meroz </page> <page sequence="72"> proper insemination, union with the serpent who represents the realm of  evil, unproductively spilt seed, and the misuse of holy names by the mystical  adepts.171 The structural analogy between all the cycles of creation and “fall”  invests the very first sequence of failures with the negative connotations  of sexual and mystical transgressions that are overtly associated with the  subsequent sequences of failure. Notably, the emphasis on negative sexuality  as a mark of the flawed creation is characteristic of a number of late- antique Gnostic schools. Scholem maintained that the notion of Sophia  in the Valentinian Gnosis had an important impact on the depiction of  Wisdom in the Book Bahir (and through this book, on the whole history  of Kabbalah): just like Sophia, Wisdom had split, and one of its elements  (called Shekhina – the divine presence) “fell,”172 but eventually, at the end  of time, it will rise and regain its earlier status. In SD, on the other hand,  the notion of Wisdom as such does not come up at all, while the ideas of  falling and rising are connected first and foremost to negative sexuality. As  Scholem has already observed, “The multifaceted sexual etiological myth,  which purports to account for the existence and the origin of evil in this  world, reveals a major aspect of Gnostic consciousness,”173 but although  this is true of some Valentinian texts, it is much more conspicuous in and  typical of the Sethian mythical tradition.174 A comparable emphasis on negative sexuality occurs in Ma’amar al  ha’atsilut hasemalit by the thirteenth-century Spanish kabbalist Isaac  Hakohen. Overall, there are a number of motifs that connect SD to Isaac  Hakohen’s writings, among them the very notion of the thirteen attributes,  the view of serpents or sea-monsters as representations of the forces of evil,  the concept of the repeated destruction of worlds as opposed to a fixed end  of time, the tension between licit and illicit sexuality as a mark not only  of humanity but also of the divine realm, and the conceptualization of the  history of mankind (Adam, Eve, and their descendants) as the history of  the godhead.175 It is also worthy of note that Isaac Hakohen repeatedly  claimed that most of his traditions had reached him from the Levant,  171 Note that the transgression associated with practitioners of the esoteric-mystical tradition  is confined to the misuse of holy names, without reference to the possible misapprehension  or misuse of the kabbalistic theosophy of the sefirot. 172 see e.g. Scholem, Origins of the Kabbalah, especially 91-97. 173 See Gedaliahu G. Stroumsa, Another Seed: Studies in Gnostic Mythology (Leiden: Brill, 1984),  73. 174 Ibid., passim but especially 35-70. The resemblance of Sethian Gnosticism to Kabbalah has  not been noticed by scholars. 175 For a detailed account of these parallels, see Meroz, “Va’ani lo hayiti sham?!” 178-82. LXXX The Archaeology of  the Zohar </page> <page sequence="73"> France and the Rhineland, and this points to the sources from which SD,  too, may have drawn the ideas it shares with Isaac Hakohen. Previous studies of SD have detected in the work the presence of a  doctrine of cosmic cycles. In such a doctrine, the created world is envisaged  as being repeatedly, and at fixed times, subject to total destruction followed  by a wholly new creation. This accords with the view of the long version  (as in §9 and the beginning of §73, which are not included in the present  edition of the text), but the view of the short version requires a more  nuanced interpretation. According to the short version, the world is indeed  subject to cycles of creation and destruction, but the destruction in each case  is presented as a “fall” – a flawed or an incomplete state of being, which  never amounts to total annihilation, and by the same token, the creation  that follows is never entirely new. Thus, in the view of the short version,  the world we currently inhabit is essentially the same world as the one  first created by the godhead at the beginning of time. Nor are the cycles  of creation, “fall,” and “renewal” temporally fixed; the duration of each stage  depends on the variability of human action on the one hand, and of certain  processes taking place within the divine world on the other. The short version moves, in effect, from a discussion of primordial  processes to a discussion of the deeds of man, comprising both sexual  and mystical practices. The text thus bears an ethical as well as a practical  message, providing guidance not only on how to avoid damaging the  creation again, but also on how to rectify the damage, and to induce  the “complete name” to act on it so as to enable the creation to achieve  “completion,” namely, a state of perfection. The aspiration to realize these  goals effectively redefines and gives new meaning to the life of the kabbalist. All this is present in the long version as well, but with an emphasis  specifically on man’s manipulation of the letters of the alphabet, which aims  to preserve the “modesty” of the creator, in other words, to avoid exposing  His “nakedness” to the world. The long version thus provides man with a  wider scope for action, and offers the opportunity to engage in a wider range  of mystical practices, but the sexual dimension of the processes it describes is  just as prominent here as it is in the short version, which suggests that the  transition from the short version to the long did not obscure the Gnostic  theme of illicit sexuality. We saw in section 1.5 above how often SD features in other parts of  the zoharic literature. It is not impossible that in SD itself, or perhaps in  the intersection between SD and the works of Isaac Hakohen, lies the well- attested concern of the kabbalists to maintain a particularly rigorous standard  of sexual purity. Not only do they endeavour to preserve the purity of sexual  LXXXI Ronit  Meroz </page> <page sequence="74"> relations by refraining from contact with menstruating or gentile women,  but they also view the sin of spilling one’s seed in vain with the utmost  severity, to the point of insisting without precedent, as in one well-known  zoharic passage, that for this transgression no amount of repentance would  ever atone.176 Be that as it may, it is clear that adherence to the rigours  of sexual purity was conceived by the authors of SD as a means of both  combating the forces of evil so as to prevent the decline of the world to  chaos, and “elevating” or “restoring” the creation to wholesome existence. Apart from their considerable disparity of length, the most conspicuous  difference between the two versions is the division of the long version  into five chapters, which is not present in the short version. This division,  which may allude to the five books of the Pentateuch,177 is explicitly  referred to in the introduction to the long version (most of which is  missing from the short version). Hence, even if the transition from the  short version to the long was effected in several stages, it is still likely  that the introduction and the division into chapters belonged to the same  editorial stage of composition.178 In light of this, other elements belonging  to this editorial stage now come into view. They include, for example, the  insertion of SD into the pericope “Terumah,” which concerns the temple  cult and the priesthood. This points to the existence of a layer of the  text, of which little else remains, that connected the themes of SD to the  temple cult and the priesthood – the subject matters of this particular  pericope.1 79 Another example is the appearance in the introduction to  SD of the motif of “entering” and “emerging,” which appears again only  in the narrative framework that concludes the book (§73). This motif is  based on the famous talmudic story of the four who entered Paradise (BT  Ḥag. 14b), where Rabbi Aqiva is described as the only one who “entered”  and “emerged” unhurt. The motif is further developed in the Idras, but it  does not appear in any other part of SD. If it is indeed an interpolation  designed to evoke the memory of Rabbi Aqiva’s mystical experience, it may  well attest to a conscious attempt to integrate the experiential dimension  of the Idras into SD. This would seem to suggest that the ideas articulated  in SD were revealed in the course of a dramatic event, comparable to the  revelatory experiences described in the Idras. 176 See Zohar 1:219b; Pachter, Shilo, “Shemirat haberit: letoledotav shel isur hotsa’at zera  levatalah” (Ph.D. diss., Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 2006), ch. 4. 177 See Liebes, Torat hayetsirah, 130. 178 It should be noted that we are dealing with editorial stages or textual strata that are close  but not necessarily identical to each other. 179 See also the discussion at n. 84. LXXXII The Archaeology of  the Zohar </page> <page sequence="75"> Several conclusions may be drawn from these findings. Firstly, it is  clear that both the introduction and the concluding narrative of SD  constitute a single literary unit, which is extraneous to the work itself.  Secondly, this observation corroborates the hypothesis that the short version  preserves the earliest foundations of the work and has served as the basis  of the long version, although in its present form, it contains additional  materials that entered it at subsequent stages of composition. Thirdly, the  literary framework (comprising the introduction and the conclusion) is  in broad terms contemporaneous with the Idras, which themselves are an  interpretation of the long version of SD. Finally, SD’s enigmatic name has to be explained in relation to both its  contents and its style. Over the years, it has attracted a great deal of scholarly  attention, lending itself to many ingenious and diverse interpretations. My  sense is that the significance of the name can be appreciated only against  the background of the book’s highly evocative but extremely sparse language.  Each of its turns of phrase triggers a wide range of associations, which I  do not believe to be accidental but rather a deliberate strategy. Gershom Scholem suggested that the Aramaic title should be  translated into Hebrew as Megilat setarim and into English as the “Book  of Concealment” – both equally ambivalent phrases which could mean  either a work about concealed matters or a work which is itself a matter  of concealment.180 Both are appropriate, especially for the short version,  which conceals much more than it reveals. By contrast, the long version  occasionally claims that it is revealing, for the first time, the most esoteric  doctrines, particularly those that entail the anthropomorphic depiction of the  divine, as it does, for example, when it refers (albeit without full explication)  to the supernal beards.181 In this context, mention should be made of a  work known by precisely the Hebrew title proposed by Scholem for SD,  Megilat setarim, which is attributed to Nachmanides and deals, not unlike  our SD, with the link between forbidden sexual relations and cosmogony.182 Yehuda Liebes has proposed a number of linguistic contexts and  conceptual affinities that may elucidate the name SD. He focuses on the  diverse meanings of the Aramaic and Arabic root ע-נ-צ (tsade-nun-ʽayin)  giving rise to the noun tseniʽuta, and suggests, for example, that the book’s  180 Gershom Scholem, Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism (New York: Schocken Books, 1974),  160, 386 n. 9. 181 And see also §§14, 33, and the notes ad loc. 182 The latest discussion of this question is in Idel, “Perushim lesod haʽarayot,” 138-48, 196-9.  See also his references to earlier studies, especially in relation to ”sod haʽarayot” and to the  identity of its author. LXXXIII Ronit  Meroz </page> <page sequence="76"> title may point to its function as a repository of esoteric traditions, stressing  particularly the purpose of storing them for future generations; to its poetic  literary character, marked by carefully weighed metered speech; and to the  mystery of the creation, which is the book’s primary subject matter. 183 Some specifically Hebrew connotations of the root tsade-nun-ʽayin may  be added to these. According to Kaddari’s dictionary of biblical Hebrew,184  the root occurs only as a verb in the paʽal (as a passive participle) and the  hif ’il forms. The former connotes humility and submissiveness (as opposed  to insolence), which Kaddari illustrates with Prov. 11: 2: “When insolence  comes, then comes shame; but with the humble (tsenu’im) is wisdom,”  while latter means to conduct oneself submissively, as in Micah 6: 8: “Walk  submissively (hatsneʽa lekhet) with your God.”185 As Kaddari points out,  the sense of humility survives into Rabbinic Hebrew, as in “How humble  [tsenuʽah] this woman was” (BT Shab. 53b). In this sense, therefore, the title  Sifra ditseniʽuta would mean the “Book of Humility,”186 which fits both the  short version and the long, since both of them focus on matters, such as  holy names, that are accessible only to the “humble.” Moreover, since we  know that humility preconditions access to and safe exit from pardes (namely  paradise, in reference to mystical experience),187 the name Sifra ditseniʽuta  may well reflect also the long version’s concern with this topic. In Rabbinic Hebrew the root tsade-nun-ʽayin can have the connotation  specifically of sexual modesty.188 As we have seen, SD deals at length  with the primordial couple’s illicit sexuality, its fateful consequences and  subsequent rectification.189 This suggests that the sexual connotation of  183 For these, and additional suggestions, see Liebes, “How the Zohar Was Written,” 200-201  n. 58; id., “Zohar ve’eros,” 78-9; and id., Torat hayetsirah, 128-31. See also The Zohar, ed.  Matt, 587-8. 184 Menahem Z. Kaddari, Milon haʽivrit hamiqra’it (Ramat Gan: Bar Ilan University Press,  2006), 917. 185 Ariel Klein, who was kind enough to share with me a chapter from his incomplete London  doctoral dissertation, which deals specifically with all the possible meanings of the name  Sifra ditseniʽuta, has already studied all the biblical connotations of the root ענצ, using a wide  range of dictionaries. He drew attention to the significant fact that the reference in Prov.  11:2 to “the humble” (tsenuʽim) is directly preceded, in the previous verse, by a reference to  a balance. See also Matt, Zohar, 587-588. 186 See also Ben-Yehuda, Milon halashon haʽivrit, s.v. 5550-1; 5256-7. 187 See Liebes, “How the Zohar Was Written,” 200-201 n. 58; id., Ḥet’o shel Elisha: arbaʽah  shenikhnesu lapardes vetivʽah shel hamistiqah hatalmudit ( Jerusalem: Hebrew University Press,  1986). 188 See ע-נ-צ in the Israel Academy of the Hebrew Language’s Historical Dictionary Project:  http://maagarim.hebrew-academy.org.il/Pages/PMain.aspx. 189 Where it seems that the blame is not attributed specifically to the woman. LXXXIV The Archaeology of  the Zohar </page> <page sequence="77"> the root is particularly relevant here,190 associated as it is with secrecy,  concealment, and modesty in relation to the sexual parts of the body.191 In  the following zoharic passage, for example, referring to Abraham and his  wife Sarai, tseniʽuta in the sense of the modesty displayed by both partners  has clear sexual connotations: And he said to Sarai his wife, “Behold, now I know that you are a  beautiful woman” [Gen. 12: 11]. Did he not know that until then?  Rather, we have learnt192 that until that time, Abraham had never  looked at her figure because of the great modesty that existed between  them.193 According to the Mishnah (Hag.2:1), access to three esoteric bodies of  knowledge should be strictly limited: licit and illicit sexual relations (arayot),  the account of the creation (ma’seh bereshit) and the workings of the divine  chariot (ma’seh merkavah). SD deals with all three, albeit not in equal  measure.194 Having observed SD’s tendency to employ few words by which to express  multiple meanings, we may be entitled to decipher its title in this spirit  along the follows line: it is a scroll of secrets and a metered poem, stored  for the meek and the sexually modest, to reveal to them alone, and in  short-hand only, the esoteric wisdom concerning sexual relations (both licit  and illicit), the mysteries of Creation, the workings of the divine Chariot,  the safe experience of paradise, and the creative use of holy names. 190 See also Matt, 587-588. 191 See Marcus Jastrow, A Dictionary of the Targumim, the Talmud Babli and Yerushalmi, and the  Midrashic Literature ( Jerusalem: Horeb, 1995), 1291, s.v. tseni’ut. 192 BT BB 16a. 193 Zohar 1:81b. Notably, modesty is ascribed here to the sexual behavior of the couple, not  specifically of the wife. Cf. Zohar 3:125b, where a woman displays her modesty by covering  her hair even at home. 194 For the brief reference to the workings of the Merkavah, which has not featured in the present  analysis, see §38. It should be emphasized that SD’s references to “licit and illicit sexual  relations” concern primarily those that take place within the godhead, on the metaphysical  plane.
