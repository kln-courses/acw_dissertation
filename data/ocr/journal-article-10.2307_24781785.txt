<plain_text><page sequence="1">PRACTICING ANTHROPOLOGY Vol. 26, No. 3, Summer 2004 TOWARDS LEGITIMIZATION AND MOBILIZATION: ANTHROPOLOGISTS AS EXPERT WITNESSES BETWEEN TWO NATIVE DISCOURSES By Alfredo Wagner Berno de Almeida Tn 1988 I was appointed by the Brazil ian Anthropological Association (ABA) to the task of officially identify ing and legitimizing remnant quilombo1 communities in Alcântara, Maranhäo State, Brazil, whose existence was threatened by the installation of a military missile base in this area. My appointment resulted from an agree ment signed between ABA and Brazil's Attorney General's Office in 2002, and my responsibility entailed preparing an expert report to constitute their ethnic ity and just claim to land. By definition, anthropological expert reports have the purpose of providing inputs and technical support for judicial and extra judicial processes of Brazil's Federal Prosecution Service (Ministério Publico Federal—MPF) in questions regarding the rights and interests of indigenous peoples, remnant quilombo communi ties, and other groups. The guiding principal in this genre of work is that anthropological expertise is essential in understanding the mechanisms em ployed by these populations in asserting their ethnic identity and the rights that accrue to them. The municipio (county) of Alcântara has a population of about 22,000 people and is situated in an environmental protection area called the "Maranhäo Recess" (Reentrâncias Maranhenses), located in Maranhäo State, on the eastern fringes of the Amazon region, just south of the Equator. It covers an area of approximately 1,200 square kilometers, along a peninsula between the Cumä and Sào Marcos Bays, near Brazil's Atlantic coastline. This area is considered a prime geographic loca tion for a missile base, given that it is possible to launch rockets that quickly Alfredo Wagner Berno de Almeida (secondfrom right) escape the earth's atmosphere since it is situated in the equatorial zone, thus saving on fuel and placing satellites in orbit. For these reasons, in 1980 authorities from Brazil's then Military Regime decided to build a missile base in this location. To this end, an area of 520 Km2 was expropriated, and later expanded to 620 Km2. Construction began in 1983 by building basic infrastructure, such as launching pads, airstrips and other aerospace facilities. In a colonial pos ture, these initiatives showed total contempt for the 2,500 families of fish ermen and farmers distributed among 152 hamlets, whose forebears settled this area since the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th centuries. Settle ment by these people began after the crash in the cotton market and breakup of large rural estates belonging to religious orders (Jesuits, Carmelites and Mercedarians) not to mention the dismantling of large mono-cropped plantations that produced cotton and sugar cane with African slave labor. By virtue of the freedom these com munities gained in the 19th and 20th cen turies these families are demanding due recognition as remnant quilombo groups in accordance with Article 68 of the Act for Transitory Constitutional Disposi tions of the Brazilian Constitution. Thus, the installation of the missile base served not only as major motiva tion in rallying against it, coordinated mainly by the local Rural Workers Union, but also spurred a quilombo social movement. In 1986, as the missile base was under construction, 312 of these fami lies were forced to relocate. Others are also threatened with the same fate, as a result of launching lease agreements, recently signed between the Brazilian</page><page sequence="2">Vol. 26, No. 3, Summer 2004 PRACTICING ANTHROPOLOGY 27 government and other countries, such as the U.S. and the Ukraine. Under these agreements, the U.S. and the Ukraine are scheduled to launch rockets from the Alcântara Base, in areas of restricted access to outsiders, under their control. Social tensions became more acute in the region as initiatives to expand the base would result in the forced reloca tion of an additional 500 families. These tensions have escalated as the results of a recent impact study, required for environmental licensing of the Base, deemed the area an "empty space." Thus, these studies rendered these remnant quilombo communities invis ible. These circumstances led the MPF to request an expert anthropological inquiry into the situation to vouch for the ethnic identification of the quilombo communities. The expert report I was to prepare and submit was expected to present arguments and clarify doubts in a formalized legal manner, with a detailed description of social conflicts and historical facts, but also by illu minating the demands of the impacted communities. Based on a prior field investiga tion in 1985, when I produced a report for Brazil's Ministry of Land Reform highlighting the incongruences of the agro-village model implemented by the Base's administration, I divided the current fieldwork in two phases: the first merging the basic organizing prin ciples of fieldwork and anthropological procedures necessary in producing the so-called "expert evidence"; the second phase consisting of a more applied and direct response to legal questions raised by State attorneys from the MPF. This distinction of these two phases is important in understanding the nature of this type of intervention since it produces a unique kind of anthropologi cal knowledge. In this regard, anthro pologists do not merely recognize and diagnose 'official problems' implicated in the course of legal jurisprudence, carried out in proceedings and inqui ries conducted by legal professionals. Additionally, anthropological research yielding expert reports requires a unique way of linking theory to intervention, so as to avoid a pro forma relationship between uniform theoretical concepts and concrete problems encountered in local, everyday reality. Thus, theo retical concepts cannot be applied mechanically, and require successive approaches and appropriate research strategies adapted to specific field situations. A brief description of this region and the 'problem' is in order, given that this particular investigation cannot be re duced to a 'cultural area study,' or lim ited to given geographical boundaries. As a localized 'problem' dealing with specific regional players bearing unique forms of expression and symbolic repre sentation, ethnic identification becomes inseparable from the territorialization process of the quilombo communities and their own criteria for identifying group members. In this respect commu nities in this area are reckoned along the lines of social organization and eco nomic, political and religious structures all empirically observable within the network of hamlets distributed through out this locale. Field Work and Selecting Informants During the early stages of fieldwork, conducted from April through June of 2002, community residents suggested that I contact people who could recon struct their history of place. Even before any questions could be formulated, they recommended that we follow this pro cedure. In this light, my first impression was that informants were establishing a necessary relation between historical fact and identity. This sentiment was expressed collectively by the demands they lodged with government agencies to be officially recognized as remnant quilombo communities. On the other hand, there were also many individual stories and a specialized knowledge that I presumed would have been more diffuse and collective. As such, it could be argued that the tensions spurred by the construction of the missile base gave rise to a local history of place as the past is incurred as an argument and an historical fact, countering any would be plans of ouster and dispossession. Similarly, other community members politicized their history, bringing the past into the present and fleshing out group history. The first leg of fieldwork thus en tailed working with community elders, both men and women, although I was introduced to local hamlets by other players such as labor union leaders and institutional agents. In addition to the special status conferred to local elders, they receive monthly retire ment benefits, and have an economic advantage over most residents, helping their families in their livelihoods, and also volunteer their labor on local farms and households. Although they are under no legal obligation to do so, some 900 retirees have contributed generously and spontaneously to the Rural Workers Labor Union (STTR) of Alcântara. Their contributions to local associations are also significant from a numerical standpoint since Brazil's last demographic census revealed that more than 8 percent of the resident popula tion of Alcântara is over 60 years of age. Although these aspects yield a special status to local elders, their gate keeping of group history also derives from the fact that they are directly descended from community ancestors, by blood or affinity, who assured free access of family groups to land, and by the fact that they have symbolically defined responsibilities with regard to former landowning families or divinities (male or female saints) and religious groups (brotherhoods, orders) that also provided them with access to property. Therefore, the criterion of age is not an isolated factor but is always as sociated and combined with factors of genealogy and patronage, or sponsor ship. As to the notion of genealogy one should note that convergence towards single informants on records pertain ing to family group trajectories may transcend relations of consanguinity. Some people are locally bound by kin ship relations although no genealogical link of consanguinity was absolutely confirmed among them. Even though</page><page sequence="3">28 PRACTICING ANTHROPOLOGY Vol. 26, No. 3, Summer 2004 there are no formal legal devices for recognizing the social contract that binds these people, there are rituals of social cohesion that go beyond simple kinship and friendship networks. In turn, these sociocultural assets strength en community ties built on political and organizational criteria that also contrib ute towards constructing a sentiment of place and history. In terms of patronage, or sponsor ship, we are reminded of George Foster's definition of a contractual, informal and asymmetric relationship between "persons" of differing status and power exchanging distinct goods and services. These exchanges may be symbolic and established between inhabitants of the same community, or outsiders, including divinities (male and female saints) and supernatural beings (Foster, 1967:221). The genealogical and patronage factors, thus defined, are updated in the perspective of the infor mants, through donations, acquisitions, inheritance and informal authorizations for the free use of natural resources and/ or leases, occupations and conflicts with antagonists who planned to usurp their lands in the past. For many years, these mechanisms assured land transfers and created a 'commons' ethic of resource utilization that were fundamental in the physical and social reproduction of these families. Local narratives of these mechanisms contrast with official documents and public records that primarily gear the question of land towards 'persons,' be they allottees, religious orders, divini ties or purchasers, particularly since Brazil's Real Estate Law of 1850. In this perspective, land itself is not framed in terms of rural property and/or subaltern people (slaves and freemen) who, for all practical intents and pur poses, worked and controlled the land (Shiraishi 1990:04). This situation is further compounded when we attempt to identify specific people, per se, as we need to be mindful of the well-known difficulties in record-keeping regarding age, sex, ethnic background and slave families. Even after the legislation of 1850 and the requirement for parish land registry, this problem still persists. Alfredo Wagner Berno de Almeida Interviewing Members of the Quilombo Communities in Alcäntara, Maranhäo Relations between former slaves and landowners proved to be exclusion ary in practice- even with possibility of private property being owned by slaves, as noted by Perdigäo Malheiro in 1864 (Malheiro 1976: 63-96). These impediments stressed the importance of embracing oral history and using open-ended interviews during field work, given that it was only through this approach that we could gain access to the genealogies of the slave families, quilombo or not, and the common use of natural resources effectively con trolled by them. The rules for common use were historically instituted and also had the objective of overcoming the limits of local ecosystems that were left in a fragile state after large plantations deforested much of this area. As for the ancestral figures cited in the inter views, basic sustainability practices were needed to assure subsistence and community viability. As such, local residents adapted to these constraints by conserving natural resources and exercising common rights over pas tures, beaches, mangroves, salt marsh es, coconut groves, secondary growth and clusters of mango trees. For these reasons hunting, fishing and collecting forest products, as well as the removal of thatch from forest reserves—and site selection for planting—are continuous ly subject to ecological limitations and community discussions and responsi bility. In this respect, nature may be conceived as a result of the repertoire of immemorial common use practices, carried out in Alcäntara by family labor units organized by local communities, especially after the breakdown of the large plantations. The function of the narrator, who reports the legitimacy of access routes to land and the dynamics of construction of territoriality by the group as a whole, thus becomes vital in a situation of social tension and acute conflict. Division of Labor Among the Mediators I was therefore faced with the chal lenge of aptly reconstructing these communities' history and raison d'être, which go beyond the special interests of community interlocu tors, labor unions, and religious and political leaders. These latter players Alfredo Wagner Berno de Almeida Interviewing Members of the Quilombo Communities in Alcäntara, Maranhäo</page><page sequence="4">Vol. 26, No. 3, Summer 2004 PRACTICING ANTHROPOLOGY 29 attempted to synthesize the quilombo groups' collective project, acting more in their own self interest vis-à-vis the State and the other instituted powers. Under the orientation of labor media tors and community residents, I first interviewed 31 people, 26 men and 5 women, aged 60 and above, distributed throughout 25 of these communi ties. As tensions mounted with the State, the impacted families and their interlocutors were asked to indicate the more 'traditional' community resi dents to this expert witness in order to express their own perspective on what they deemed to be their inalien able rights. In this sense, the voice of political spokespersons was given a backseat as they were considered more 'modern' and employed a polished dis course tailored towards political nego tiation. This choice entailed alternating between the power of elected spokes persons who, in this instance, had to give way to 'tradition,' and establish the means for reinterpreting it. In other words, those who 'speak to the outside' do not necessarily possess the knowl edge of those who 'speak from the inside' of the communities themselves. These two discourses, then, converge on the one hand yet at the same time are profoundly distinct. And during the course of research both sets of voices intermingled to form a unique commu nity expression. The Discourse of Legitimization In this sense, these interviews may be likened to a legitimization discourse sanctioned by mediators and the group itself. The defining characteristic of this reconstruction is that community narratives go back several generations, leading back to a founding ancestor or a group of relatives whose struggle provided free access to land. The rule of descent, which connected informants to particular ancestors or groups of rela tives, provided both permanent rights and obligations concerning guarantees to resource rights that are essential to these communities. The interviews furnished information that could not be entirely cross-checked or verified, such as the genealogies of slave families and acts performed by divinities; however, as they were mean ingful to informants they could not be considered 'true or false.' The informa tion related by community elders was based on living experiences and beliefs that provide meaning to their existence and social organization. Thus, divinities can also be formally registered as property owners, as is the case of Our Lady of Livramento. Religious orders can also have land registered in their name as in the case of the Brotherhood of the Most Holy Sacrament. For her part, Saint Theresa is considered a living saint, having a sister who is also sanctified and often sighted by many community residents, treading about her lands. These and other incidents of anthropomorphism, attributing human characteristics to divinities, do not exactly transform the saints into 'patrons' or 'owners' since, historically, the act of slaves escaping to lands under divine protection was the road to liberty and consolidation of the quilombos of Alcântara. When addressing questions of mutual agree ments with other community residents, informants mentioned the use of a common land area and the rules for utilizing natural resources. In the Alcântara case, the multiplicity of types of ownership and possession of land run counter to the homogenization effect officially imposed by the Brazil ian State's administrative apparatus. Census and registration procedures usu ally suppress the ethnic factor, except in cases of tutelage, as in the case of indigenous peoples who are considered State wards, and disregard diversity for the sake of legal uniformity. Contrary to this unifying principle, in Alcântara there is a plurality of forms in appropri ating natural resources that are neither individualized, nor based on notions of private property, nor supported by the notion of possession. The Discourse of Mobilization The other contingent of people I interviewed were community rep resentatives belonging to unions, fishing guilds, and the mounting social movement of impacted communities, as well as local community associa tions. From this group 30 people were interviewed, all under 45 years of age. This number could be increased to approximately 150 if we consider participation in group meetings. Their narratives, distinct from those of com munity elders, did not look at the past and set their sights on the impending conflict. In their view, installation of the rocket base drastically limited their livelihoods and raises serious doubts about their future. They pointed out that Brazilian Air Force person nel responsible for implementing the base during these past 23 years never presented them with a timetable for carrying out programmed activities of family relocation. They also expressed a critical perception in regard to the way they are treated—as if they did not exist or were "objects," reminiscent of the "times of slavery," "captivity" or "before the whites went away." Interdictions on fishing and collecting and the freedom to move about along beaches and pathways have been cur tailed by the military base, a situation which reinforces this sentiment. Thus, the social tensions in Alcân tara keep the past very much alive in the present, and guided fieldwork procedures to discuss facts that were hidden and historically blocked from memory. This social conflict also cre ated conditions that made it possible to discuss ideals of autonomy and working in freedom. One also feels a constant mobilization for resistance against attempts to undermine their working groups, forced relocations and other repressive measures that daily reawaken in their imagination former practices of the slave regime. They view these measures as a form of moral degrada tion, especially those who were forced to move to the agro-villages and lost the means of an independent livelihood. In contrast, mobilizing efforts that exalt clandestine practices of resistance to domination and the usurpation of their lands by the military base are gaining visibility. They revive terms and expressions from the past, such as moving in and out of the so-called "holes" or hideaways, escape from</page><page sequence="5">PRACTICING ANTHROPOLOGY Vol. 26, No. 3, Summer 2004 the so-called "catching," or repressive military action, thus proclaiming a host of new practices. Hidden planting in the "lands of the base," collecting fruits, un authorized fishing in off-limit beaches or creeks, as well as cracking babassu palm nuts in the forbidden palm groves The Work of an Expert Witness on the Effects of Politicization In sum, my task entailed making these quilombo groups visible to the public eye by mapping them, doing Without abandoning the principles that guide standard scientific work and their competence as researchers, anthropologists as expert witnesses need to capture the public's imagination and create new forms of legal recognition in their quest to assure ethnic rights. have become routine actions. Such ac tions are not necessarily seen as trans gressions. In fact, they are considered legitimate, above all through the militant action of labor leaders, village represen tatives, municipal leaders and militants in the black movement, who reinterpret these defiant acts as the highest expres sion of resistance to slavery, converging towards the category of quilombos. The transition from a routine vo cabulary and actions of resistance that is fragmented and individual, to an identity that expresses a collective exis tence and action- as remnant quilombo communities- was not a simple one and only proved itself feasible, in this case, by means of ethnic mobilization. Thus, in Alcântara, we understand an ethnic group to be an organizational type (Barth 2000: 11), that is, the group of families impacted by the Base, through the quilombo category, and that began considering itself as such, being viewed as a form of legitimate social orga nization. While there are groups that have not mobilized around their ethnic identity, which would seem self-evident, there are others who must build this identity in light of the prevailing social invisibility imposed upon them. census surveys, reconstituting gene alogies, and concretely describing life in these communities. This form of anthropological intervention helped strengthen the relationship with local mediators and winning their confidence in order to complete research activities in the Alcântara communities. The tacit refusal of the military authorities in contributing to the expert report, when requested by the Brazil's Attorney General's Office, reinforced this soli darity during data collection. These im passes and relations, indeed, present a challenge to our so-called competence as expert witnesses. In these kinds of endeavors, anthropologists become more exposed and the critical demands placed on them increase manifold, as they, too, will submit themselves to this kind of professional risk—a situation Bourdieu once referred to as "critical reflexivity" (2001: 34), often necessary in assuring a more rigorous treatment of empirically observable facts and mobilization discourses. Thus, this type of ethnographic work contributes towards a more fine-tuned knowledge that can challenge official attempts at depoliticizing and dis crediting social movements. Without abandoning the principles that guide standard scientific work and their com petence as researchers, anthropologists as expert witnesses need to capture the public's imagination and create new forms of legal recognition in their quest to assure ethnic rights.
