The most important research tool for the history of South Asian art and archae ology was the famous bibliography entitled Annual Bibliography of Indian Archae ology (ΑΒΙΑ) published in Leiden in 20 volumes over a 50 year period until 1972. This important scholarly tool has never been replaced. Thus, the announcement that the bibliography would again be produced under an expanded administrative structure that now includes offices in Bangkok and Sri Lanka was enthusiastically greeted. The volume under review is an impressive work, which will continue to serve the scholarly public, as did its predecessor. The first 30 pages of the book are dedicated to technical information. There follows 55 pages devoted to 2 review articles. P. 55-496 contain an exhaustive annotated bibliography of 1300 entries. This is followed by 3 indexes, organized according to author, geography and sub ject matter. Thus, the printed version of this important scholarly tool is exceed ingly accessible. According to the préfacé there will be an electronic databank, which will serve as a base for an annual printed édition. The new database dealing with South and Southeast Asian art and archaeology begins in 1996, including some of 1997. The Organization of the bibliography and the various research tools is well concei ved. This reviewer consulted a large number of synopses of articles with which she was familiar and found them to be concise, fair, and balanced.The articles were gleaned from an extensive list of periodicals (6 pages long). I only noticed one omission, curiously this Journal. I trust that this oversight will be corrected in subséquent bibliographies. Of the two articles, the review of Indonesian publications, with particular emphasis on PhD dissertations, and sélective MA theses on art and archaeology written in Indonesia between 1977 and 1997 by Prof. Edi Sedyawati seems to be a logical extension of the purposes of the Bibliography. The text summarizes the publica tions in non-European languages organized by subject matter, followed by a list of PhD dissertations by Indonesian scholars outside of Indonesia, concluding with a comprehensive bibliography (p. 14-26). The review article by the général editor, Prof. Karel van Kooij (K.) entitled "No Sign of the Buddha. Recent Viewpoints on Meaning in Early Buddhist Art" at tempts to raise a lonely voice in support of Susan Huntington's argument against the idea of "aniconism" in early Indian Buddhist art. Although her theory, as K. himself says, "has been largely rejected. Most art historians nowadays seem to be happy again with the view that the artists of Barhut and Sanchi sought for means to represent the 'presence of the Buddha' through Symbols, without depicting the master in a human form." (p. 31). K. states: "Everybody has pointed out flaws in the argument without considering the strong points .... Are we back at the point that Alexander Cunningham and Alfred Foucher started one hundred years ago?" (ib.). Hardly, since as K. himself notes this debate has resulted in a "more advan ced terminology" to define, if not exactly explain, the phenomenon.</page><page sequence="3">Anzeigen 225 Κ. attempts to bolster Huntington's position by criticizing the methods of inter prétation used by those who favor the theory that Buddha, in the earliest surviving monuments, was represented by symbols. K. supports his argument by references to other historical contexts, as far afield as the Dvaravati period (p. 48), and by challenging the commonly held theory of multiple layers of meaning underlying the primary visual themes used in Buddhist art: "The evidence seems to indicate that only one 'translation' i.e. one reading of a représentation, can be correct, apart from exceptional cases in which a dual meaning is clearly intended" (p. 49). Such a radical interprétation would indeed transform the understanding of the complexi ties of not only Buddhist art, but religious visual art in général. Both these points have been succinctly addressed in a recent short article: Maurizio Taddei, The Buddha Image. In: R. Freschi (ed.), L'arte del buddhismo dall' India alla Cina. Milano 1999, p. 4-8. In it Taddei directly challenges Huntington's theory as well as supporting the notion of multi-valent interprétations. Taddei suggests that Buddhism did not feel the need to give the Master a human form for a time because "it must have been feit as the best way to render his meaning" (p. 5). There follows a brief discussion on the early anthropomorphic Buddha images: "Further layers of symbolic meanings will in time come to enrich the Buddha image: the investigation in this field will hardly ever be brought to an end" (p. 8). An older article that argued against Huntington's theory that should be added to those mentioned in the review article is Rob N. Linrothe's "Inquiries into the Origin of the Buddha Image. A Review" (EW 43 [1993] 241-256). The ΑΒΙΑ Index is of great importance for the study of South and Southeast Asian art and archaeology. Not only are subséquent volumes eagerly awaited but it is also to be hoped that the difficult task of filling in the gap between 1972 and 1996 will be undertaken.
