<plain_text><page sequence="1">LIFE-CYCLE AND COHORT STUDIES OF AGINGt Aging in the Early 20th Century By CLAYNE L. POPE AND LARRY T. WIMMER* There is a new awareness of an evolution in human "physical" capital that may rival changes in human "intellectual' capital and changes in technology in its impact upon eco- nomic growth and ultimately upon our stan- dard of living or quality of life (Robert W. Fogel, 1994). Of particular interest are the dramatic improvements in morbidity and mor- tality over the past 100 years, especially that part of this improvement that began well be- fore major investments in public health or gains in modem medical technologies. These documented improvements in human "physi- cal" capital seem to be both cause and effect of the earlier Industrial Revolution, which ap- pears to have produced its own revolution in nutrition, health, and longevity. At the same time, there are many new ques- tions raised by these observed improvements, including the nature of the relationship be- tween various anthropomorphic measures and the risk of disease and death; the pace and tim- ing of the observed cycling and eventual de- cline in height and rise of mortality during the mid and late 19th century, a period of rising real wages and increasing per capita income; and the impact of these changes upon one's ability to leave the labor force for leisure or retirement. Cross-sectional data sets are unlikely to pro- vide good evidence of past changes or future developments in morbidity and mortality. Life expectation at birth based on a cross section of mortality rates for a given year has proved to be a poor estimate of actual mortality experi- ence. Both a well-founded understanding of long-term trends in human health and a solid empirical basis on which to make policy de- cisions about the future require development and analysis of longitudinal data sets. Further- more, such data sets must be very long-term in nature in order to establish possible rela- tionships between conditions and events in childhood and late-age experience and behav- ior. Biological processes imply that cohort ef- fects on morbidity, mortality, and related issues such as health expenditures and retire- ment are likely to be significant and that the effects could be delayed. Consequently, it may well be necessary to examine variables and conditions that are more than 75 years apart. One of the most promising new data sets which may shed considerable light on these and other questions related to changes in hu- man "physical" capital is the Union Army recruit sample. This sample consists of ap- proximately 36,000 men born between 1820 and 1843, and it forms the core of the NIH- NSF-funded "Early Indicators of Later Work Levels, Disease and Death" project. For the past six years the Department of Economics at Brigham Young University and the Center for Population Economics at the University of Chicago have been involved in the collec- tion, cleaning, and coding of records from seven different data sources which provide impressive life profiles of these recruits and their families. The cornerstone of this new data set is the pension system of the Union Army. These pension records (PR) contain extensive information on occupational pat- terns, geographic mobility, health (including diseases), accidents and injuries, family struc- ture, living arrangements and conditions after retirement, and cause of death. To date, infor- mation on 303 randomly selected companies of the Union Army has been collected, cov- ering over 36,000 Civil War recruits, more than 26,000 of whom are found in the pension system, and almost 20,000 with periodic t Discussants: David Weir, University of Chicago; Joel Mokyr, Northwestern University. * Department of Economics, Brigham Young Univer- sity, Provo, UT 84602, and NBER. 217</page><page sequence="2">218 AEA PAPERS AND PROCEEDINGS MAY 1998 medical examinations. In addition to these pension records, the data set contains the mil- itary service records for all recruits, wartime medical records of those entering Army hos- pitals, and data from the Census manuscripts for 1850, 1860, 1900, and 1910. Thus, in ad- dition to an almost continuous record of em- ployment and migration, the final data set will include frequent medical examinations by three board-certified physicians. These exam- inations of general health conditions, as well as complaints listed by the recruit, occur at an average interval of three years once a pen- sioner enters the system. Ratings given by the board physicians represent the severity of ob- served health problems. The pension records and the Census manuscripts are used to record the family structure, including the ethnicity, occupation, and wealth of the recruit's parents. We are currently in the final year of collec- tion of this data set which will ultimately be available for public use in several forms, in- cluding CD ROM with accompanying docu- mentation. Just how extensive the coverage may be for a typical recruit is indicated by the "'potential" number of variables within each record: military service record (MSR), 799 variables; carded military record (CMR), 795 variables; pension record (PR), 1,352 vari- ables; Census records (CEN), 1,294 variables; and the medical examinations (Surgeons Cer- tificates [SCRT]), 2,007 variables, for a total number of 6,247 possible observations per re- cruit. For cohorts of white males born between 1840 and 1844, between 75.1 percent and 97.7 percent were examined for military service, and between 57.8 percent and 81.4 percent ac- tually served. Findings from earlier work ver- ify that these Union Army recruits are representative of the Northern, white-male population of military age; that the foreign- born served in approximately the same pro- portions as native-born; that recruits came from households with the same average wealth as the Northern male population as a whole; and that this sample reflects the geographic distribution of the northern population (Fogel and Wimmer, 1992). Proof of the value of this new data set for longitudinal studies of factors affecting the ag- ing process, rests on the quality and signifi- cance of the work produced. This paper examines the work of five scholars who have been among those principally involved over the past six years, not only in the construction of the data set, but in using the Union Army data to examine an interesting range of prob- lems associated with aging. Four of these scholars, Chulhee Lee, Dora L. Costa, John Kim, and Sven Wilson, have been graduate students of Robert Fogel, the principal inves- tigator of the "Early Indicators . . ." project, and one, Louis Nguyen, was at the time a med- ical student at the University of Chicago. Much of the important work to date stemming from the Union Army sample may be sum- marized by the previous work of these five scholars. The basic strength of the Union Army sam- ple lies in the linkage of anthropomorphic measures to mortality and morbidity. John Kim, in his recent dissertation (Kim, 1996), examines the regularities observed in the weight-risk and height-risk relationships among different populations. Building upon the earlier work of Hans Th. Waaler (1984), Kim adds evidence of the value of height- weight-risk surfaces and the body-mass index (BMI) in tracking changes in health and mor- tality trends. Kim's findings of the indepen- dent relationship of both height and BMI upon mortality, and of the secular trend in the av- erage level of BMI have important policy im- plications. Given our inability to change height beyond childhood, it requires that we examine policies regarding prenatal and early childhood care and nutrition if a nation is to move toward a more optimal BMI. Dora Costa's ( 1995a, b, 1996) work on fac- tors affecting the age of retirement has added considerably to our knowledge of that process. She finds strong evidence that the tendency to- ward retirement and earlier ages of retirement began well before public-policy legislation of the New Deal. Between 1880 and 1930 labor- force participation of men 65 years of age and older dropped from 78 percent to 58 percent (Jon Roger Moen, 1987). By comparing re- tirement rates found in the Civil War pension records with current rates, Costa found that 70 percent of the decline in labor-force partici- pation experienced among white males be- tween 1880 and 1990 occurred before 1960, and much of this occurred before the passage</page><page sequence="3">VOL. 88 NO. 2 LIFE-CYCLE AND COHORT STUDIES OF AGING 219 of the Social Security Act (Costa, 1995a p. 298). Clearly, the Civil War pension played a role in the decision of its recipients to retire. By 1900, the Civil War pension was received by 35 percent of all U.S. white males between the ages of 55 and 59 and 21 percent of those aged 60-64. Pension income averaged $135 per year or 53 percent of the income of farm laborers and 36 percent of the wage of non- farm workers (Costa, 1995a p. 299). Even though the Civil War pension system did not require that one leave the labor force, as in the case of modem Social Security benefits, Costa found that a $10 increase in monthly pension income increased the probability of retirement by 0.09. The retirement rate among Civil War veterans in the pension system was double that of a random sample of nonveterans. Perhaps the most important finding for modem poli- cymakers is the declining importance of in- come over time on the decision to leave the labor force. The elasticity of labor-force par- ticipation with respect to pension income was very strong in the Union Army sample, at 0.73, and rising as income from pensions rose. Other recent studies find a smaller impact on labor- force nonparticipation whether compared against assets or Social Security retirement and disability payments, with measured elas- ticities varying between 0.16 and 0.63 (Costa, 1995a pp. 315-16). These findings suggest the following conclusions: first, at the turn of the century there existed a strong relationship between income and retirement; second, the importance of current income or wage upon the retirement decision has been declining over time; third, the importance of leisure goods upon retirement decisions appears to be increasing; and finally, the Social Security ad- ministrators and lawmakers may face consid- erable difficulty in attempting to induce later ages of retirement as a remedy for the financial problems of Social Security. Costa's work on height, weight, and mor- tality, suggests the value of the Union Army recruit sample in the modern debate involving anthropomorphic issues (Costa, 1993a, b). Costa finds in the Civil War sample an average BMI of 22.8 compared to 25.0 for males in Waaler's study of modern Norway (Costa, 1993a p. 441). This low BMI among pension- ers of the Civil War partially explains why their mortality rate was higher than that of co- horts born today. Men with a BMI below 20 made up 14 percent of the sample and ac- counted for 38 percent of total mortality. If Union Army recruits had possessed the mod- em BMI distribution found in Waaler' s study, the resulting 14-percent decline in mortality would account for 20 percent of the total de- cline between 1900 and 1986 (Costa, 1993a p. 444). Combining Costa's findings relating BMI and mortality with her earlier studies of in- come and retirement has produced important results (Costa, 1996). Not only would a mod- em BMI have reduced mortality, but it would also have increased labor-force participation (by reducing retirement) by as much as 10 percent and, therefore, increased total output. Costa finds a strong relationship between re- tirement and health in the Union Army data. At the same time, however, in addition to the declining importance of current income, there exists even stronger evidence of a significant decline over time in the importance of ill health as an explanation for one's decision to leave the labor force. Costa finds the elasticity of labor-force nonparticipation with respect to ill health falling from 1.07 in the Civil War sample to 0.28 in the National Health Inter- view Survey (NHIS) sample (Costa, 1996 pp. 79-80). Chulhee Lee's work with the wartime rec- ords of the Union Army recruits yield some equally surprising results (Lee, 1997). Pre- vious studies examining general trends and conditions of health have identified the greater likelihood of early death for foreign-born com- pared to native-born individuals, of urban compared to rural dwellers, and nonfarm rel- ative to farm inhabitants. The Civil War, how- ever, created a situation in which many populations were brought together into an un- usually dangerous disease environment, and according to Lee (1997), produced the oppo- site results from those observed for the general population. Native-born recruits from rural areas and farms suffered an increased risk of contracting disease and of dying from those diseases, compared to urban or foreign-born populations. Thus, those who were healthier before the war were at greater risk during the war, suggesting the importance of the general</page><page sequence="4">220 AEA PAPERS AND PROCEEDINGS MAY 1998 disease environment upon health, and the mit- igating effects of prior contact and natural im- munities in the battle against disease. In addition, Lee also finds that prior family wealth does not provide explanatory evidence of war-related diseases and death among the Civil War recruits. The exceptions were those diseases that tend to be nutritionally based such as measles, diarrhea, and tuberculosis and other respiratory diseases. These results high- light the complex relationship between the dis- ease environment and other socioeconomic characteristics. Possibly one of the most important papers stems from an early 20-company subsample of the Union Army data. This paper (Fogel et al., 1993) finds evidence of higher prevalence rates for chronic disease among Civil War vet- erans compared to veterans of a similar age who served in World War II and the Korean Conflict. Heart disease was 2.9 times more prevalent in the Union Army subsample, mus- culoskeletal and respiratory diseases were 1.6 times as prevalent, and digestive diseases were 4.7 times greater than modem levels. These observed differences between comparable ages over the past 70 years suggest a decline in chronic disease rates as high as 6 percent per decade. Work in progress by Sven Wilson, based upon a larger sample, suggests that further ev- idence will confirm the signs of the earlier re- sults even though the magnitude of the decline is still unknown. If this intertemporal decline in chronic disease continues, it will have pro- found implications for improvements in the health and welfare of the U.S. population over time. These improvements in health and the increasing age of onset of chronic illness could reduce future demands for health care and in- crease the ability of an aging population to re- main in the labor force. Based upon the work of Dora Costa, however, whether these im- provements imply increased labor-force par- ticipation by those over 65 depends less upon their health than upon continued changes in income, demand for leisure, and the elasticity of nonparticipation with respect to income and health. Wilson and Mark Rudberg (1996) are among the first to use the Union Army sample to examine disease-specific prevalence rates by age. Their disease-specific results con-firm the presence of a secular decline in chronic disease at older ages. They compare conges- tive heart failure (CHlF) rates found in the physicians' examinations in the Union Army data with that found in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANE S)I sample and in the Framingham Heart Study. From a "retrospective sample" ' of 752 Union Army pensioners alive on 1 January 1910, the incidence of CH1F was 10.3 percent for indi- viduals aged 65-74 and 22.2 percent for those aged 75-84. Analysis of the prevalence of ClHF in the NHANES I sample for 1970 among those in the 65-74 age group resulted in a rate that was less than half that of the Union Army veterans, or 4.8 percent. Sini- larly, of 1,527 veterans followed by Wilson and Rudberg ( 1996) in an " 1890 prospective sample," 161 developed CHF over a 20-year follow-up period. The resulting rate of 10.5 percent among the Union Ar-my veterans com- pares to a rate of 7.6 percent found in the Fra- mingham Heart Study over the period 1970- 1990. In addition to the higher prevalence rates found among Union Army veterans, the work of Wilson and Rudberg provides impor- tant evidence of the usefulness of this new data set for the study of age-specifc diseases and morbidity and mortality rates. As useful as these findings are, we have only begun to explore the range of questions that may be addressed by this new data set. Among the issues remaining are the following: the effects of nutritional status, socioeconomic factors, and exposure to disease during devel- opmental and middle age on the morbidity and mortality rates of white males at middle and late ages; the impact of exposure to warare during late adolescence and early adulthood upon employment, morbidity, and mortality rates among white males who survive to mid- dle and late ages; the effects of specific dis- eases and other disabilities on labor-force participation rates; the nature and cost- effectiveness of arrangements for care of the aged by the nature of their disabilities and the effects of the residence where they were lodged; the effects of health and wartime ex- perience upon geographic and occupational mobility during middle and late ages; and dif- ferences between the cause of death implied</page><page sequence="5">VOL. 88 NO. 2 LIFE-CYCLE AND COHORT STUDIES OF AGING 221 by an examination of cross-sectional death certificates and inferences from a longitudinal study of morbidity using the physicians' ex- aminations. Data from this sample may also help resolve the nagging puzzle implied by the increase in life expectancy which began as early as 1870-1880, while height-by-age did not improve until as late as 1900. The above list is undoubtedly only a small part of the po- tential research agenda that may be addressed by the Union Army sample. This data set will help scholars shed new light on the beginnings of improvements in human "physical" capital as reflected by changes in health, mortality, and economic welfare during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
