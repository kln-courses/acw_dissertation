<plain_text><page sequence="1">A. H. Charteris On Wednesday 9th October the death occurred at Sydney, at the age of 67, of A. H. Charteris, Professor of International Law and Jurisprudence in the University of Sydney since 1921. The University and the Australian community have sustained a loss which will not be easily repaired. Readers of this journal know what a valuable and frequent contributor we had in him. His was an arresting personality. Besides his deep learning he brought to the discharge of his life's work a cultured and witty mind and a generous heart. The stories that have revolved about him are legion and many of them have become legendary. He surely was the most com panionable of all the pundits. Many tributes to his memory have been recorded in press and pulpit but perhaps the one which catches the spirit of the man and his essential qualities best is an article in The Jubilee Book of the Law School of the University of Sydney 1890-1940. It was written before his death by W. S. Sheldon, one of the professor's former students and he is known to have read it. We quote in part from Mr Sheldon's article: "The selection of A. H. Charteris for the Chair of International Law at our University was singularly happy. In his background there was a combination of practice with theory which preserved him from the prosy pabula which breed so rapidly without the sanction of responsibility. This was in addition to a constitutional incapacity for smugness. Thus he has never, like some more popular discoursers on important things, regaled the gaping mouths of the jejune by conveying the impression that if only God (in an anthropomorphic sense) were in his heaven all would be right with the world. In addition to teaching experience at Glasgow University, Professor Charteris held important wartime jobs at the Admiralty and in the Intelligence Department. He thus had a ringside view of the rules of International Law broadening from precedent to precedent to meet the new conditions created by a new sort of war. If the precedents broadened (in the good old bull-dog way) mainly in our favour, we 29</page><page sequence="2">December, 1940 THE AUSTRALIAN QUARTERLY could admit only to coincidence. There was no more delicate job in those days than preserving the balance between effectively blockading the enemy and lacerating the feelings of the only neutral which mattered by deviating a paragraph from the text-books. The problem was partly solved by writing new text-books. But the trump card was always the enemy, who could be guaranteed to get us out of any diplomatic mess by creating a worse one for themselves j for at this time Captain von Papen was on the threshold of his distinguished career of ambassadorial reverses which has left him the undisputed doyen of the German diplomatic corps. He is said to have driven his chief, von Bernstorff, to drink, and he certainly helped to drive his American hosts off it and into the war. Professor Charteris was in the thick of our sleight of hand work and these years of experience are part of the secret of his delightful lecturing. The rules of visit and search have almost an entertainment value when the lecturer is able to show how their application helped to rope in von Rintelen. Being a heaven sent raconteur, Professor Charteris takes full advantage of his inside knowledge to adorn the tale. "His enthusiasm for his subject has proved contagious to nearly a generation of students. His success has been almost unbelievable, for the law student with his morbid sense of the relevant is inclined to resent his attention being diverted from the parish pump to the Pierian spring. Prima facie how can the distant (and alas! now some what faded) charms of article 18 of the Covenant hope to compete against the mercenary blandishments of section 43 of the Real Property Act? International Law is a digression resented by those who in the springtime of their lives have hearts already centred on the implacable pursuit of the legendary six and eightpence. Professor Charteris has never believed that an obligation to attend lectures carries an obliga tion to listen, and he has scorned to use the weak man's sanction of the pale spectre of the February to come. His irrepressible sense of fun has captured all but the earthiest minds and even those unable to spare the time for a serious study of his subject have been improved by the influence of his broad and cultured outlook. Most good partner ships depend on contrast; and in the Law School the most potent grave and reverend seignior who rules its destinies is perfectly complemented by the incorrigible elfishness of his associate. "Professor Charteris has not immured himself in the University Law School. His most important work has been giving the public a taste for international affairs. Broadcasting may be referred to, but only as an illustration, because long before the Lord delivered us 30</page><page sequence="3">THE AUSTRALIAN QUARTERLY December, 1940 to the commentators he was forming or actively participating in groups and societies to this end, and even fixing with a glittering eye com parative strangers in the street and holding them lunchless and defenceless against the most delightful monologues they were ever likely to hear. Broadcasting gave him an opportunity to widen his range. He is far and away the best broadcaster in this country. He has a natural faculty for communicating to his listeners his culture, wit, and kindliness by means of a Glasgow burr which strikes the ear more pleasantly than most symphony concerts, and his methods are living proof of the wisdom of never being certain about matters which do not lend themselves to certainty. "The last twenty years have been prolific of conferences in many parts of the world devoted to the study of international affairs. Sphere shaking resolutions have been passed, specifics prescribed, and even sanctions imposed. In retrospect these conferences may look like an amiable excuse for globe-trotting, but their harvest may well be expected after the war. Professor Charteris many times has been Australia's representative and no native product could have done the job half as well. His colleagues have returned with funds of travel ler's tales, in most of which he is the central figure. He is evidently unable to be dull even round a conference table and it is even said that he once made the Japanese delegate chuckle; but this is unveri fied. In Canada, where the Statute of Westminster has been read as literally as the Dog and Goat Act, Professor Charteris once made things hum by telling an interviewer that this insistence on the new independence was like one belatedly wed waving her marriage lines to convince the neighbour next door that she was an honest woman. "Professor Charteris has made more than one heroic attempt to introduce us to a little civilization of the continental type. For instance, who will forget the "X" Club? His idea was that Sydney could stand one small Sunday evening group meeting over the evening meal fol discussion under the intellectual stimulus of an aroma of garlic. But he did not know Sunday or Sydney. Giants like Brennan, Lambert and Radcliffe Browne were to be found there and intoxicated by the Olympian atmosphere others would venture a few carefully prepared off-hand remarks. James Joyce would be unsmilingly dissected. The club died from gradual internal erosion, and in the end the giants were left with only themselves to talk to, which they found very boring. But the idea was a good one. Professor Charteris still refuses to believe that we have no capacity for culture and he is bound to try again soon. If you see that fraternal gleam in his eye and you care 3*</page><page sequence="4">December, 1940 THE AUSTRALIAN QUARTERLY 'for none of these things flight is your only chance for otherwise he will try to manufacture a silk purse out of your ear. "The Law School jubilee will be unlike all others if there is not a little cashing in to celebrate the occasion. Why should not one of our tycoons modestly endow some tame Boswell to attach himself to Professor Charteris and collect the unconsidered trifles that are daily being lost? For here is a personality which would be as rich as Johnson's if it were not hampered by good manners. But on second thoughts, the idea is a silly one, for embarrassment at the thought of the recording angel would probably turn him overnight into A common place type With a stick and a pipe And a well bred black and tan. "No, let the tycoon put away his money and leave us our Profes sor unendowed?one of the few witty men who is never unpleasant and almost the only lovable one who is not a bore." And so we take leave of this learned, cultured and warm-hearted Scotsman who has done so much to turn the minds of Australians towards the study and appreciation of international problems. 32</page></plain_text>
