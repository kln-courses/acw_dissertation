Verses from the Sarva-darsana-sant/raha, (he Vishnu Parana, and Ute ll?mayana, illustrating the tends of the Ch?rv?kas, or Indian Materialists, vnlh some Remarks on Freedom of Speculation in Ancient India.?By J. Mum, Esq., D.C.L., LL.D. [Read Saturday, Wlh December, 18GT.] In bis essay on tlie lie.retie;d schools of Hie Hindus, Mr. t.olcbmoko has given an account of the tenets of tlie Charvakas, or Materialists (Misc. Essays, i., 402 ff). Professor Wilson also, in bis " Sketeli &lt;?f tlie Religious Sects of the Hindus" (As. lies., Vol. XVI., pp. 5, 0), alludes to tlie attacks made by tlie founder of tlie atheistical, or materialistic school, Vrihaspati, on the Vedas and the Pralunans, and quotes sonic verses attributed to that author, in which he asserts that " the whole Hindu system is a contrivance of the priesthood to secure a means of livelihood for themselves." 1 ;mi not aware whether either the ophorisms of Vrihaspati (Vnrha.sp.ilya Sutras), to which Mr. Colebrooke refers (Misc. Ess., i., 401) as having1 been quoted by one of the commentators on the Veda uta., or the work wliieh contains the verses adduced by Proiessor Wilson, be still extant or not. As, however, the ?Sarva Dar&amp;ma Sangraba1, of M?dhava ?oh?ryya (a work containing' a concise account of the different philosophical schools of India, both orthodox and heretical), from which Professor Wilson derived the versos which ho cites, contains a good many more of a similar tendency, which are both satirical and clover, 1 shall translate the whole, and compare thorn with passages of the same tenor which occur in the Vishnu PuiTma and in the ]'.funny ana. (1.) The passage from the Sarva Paisana Sangraba is as ?ollows :? " All this has been uttered by Vrihaspati also: "1. There is no heaven, no final liberation, no soul [which continues to exist] in another world, nor any ceremonies of castes or orders which are productive of future reward. 2. The Agni ?

If [it be true that] an animal slaughtered at the Jyotishtoma Sacrifice is [in consequence] exalted te) heaven,2 why docs not the worshipper immolate his own father? 4. If a ?r?ddha (eiffering of food to the manes)8 satiates even defunct creatures, it is quite superlluous to furnish people who are setting out upon a journey with any provisions [as their friends who remain behind can offer food to (hem]. 5.

While a man does live, let him live merrily,* let him borrow money, and swallow clarified butter: how can a body return to earth after it has once been reduce;el to ashes? 7. if a man goes to another world when he epiits his body, why does not affection for his kindred impel him to ceime back? 8. Hence ceremonies for the dead are a mere means of livelihood devised by the Brahmans, and nothing else. ?). The three com 1 See Professor Wilsons "Sketch of the Religious Sects of the Hindus," above referred to; and for the words tridanda and tridandin, consult Boehtlingk and Roth's Lexicon, with the passages there cited from Manu, ix., 2Uu\ and xii., 10, 11, and other writers. 2 This refers to the notion expressed by Mauu, v. 42 : ? " The twice born man, who, knowing the meaning and principles of the Veda, slays cattle on the occasions mentioned, conveys both hiniBclf and those cattle to the summit of beatitude." (Sir \V. Joncs.) In the second act of the drama called Prabodha chandrodaya (which baa been translated into J.nglish by Dr. Taylor, and into Herman by Trofcssor Oohlstuckcr), Mfiyfunoha (or Delusion), and a Ch?rvfika are introduced among the dramatis persona?, aud give utterance to the tenets of the Indian materialists. The second and third of the verses quoted in the text from the Karvadarsanasangraba, arc adduced there also. Verse 4 of the text is varied as follows :?" If a srfiddha satiates even defunct creatures, then oil must nourish the flame of an extinguished lamp." The following stanzas arc of a similar purport with verso 1 of the text:?" The idea that the soul exists with an essence distinct from that of the body, and that it enjoys rewards after it has gone to another world, is [as vain as] the expectation of luscious fruit iron? trees growing in the sky." "If heaven is obtained by worshippers, after the pcrlormcr, the ceremonial, and the materials of the sacrifice have all passed away, then will abundant fruit be produced from ticca which have been consumed in the con flagration of a forest." In another verse the gratilicationa of the voluptuary arc contrasted with tho mortifications of tho ascetic in a sense favourable to the former. 3 Sec Manu, chap, iii., verses 122 to the end. * Dum vivimus, vivamus.

In a very short time these Asuras ( = Daityas), deluded by the Deceiver, abandoned the entire system founded on the ordinance!, of the triple Veda. Some reviled the Vedas, others the gods, others the ceremonial of sacrifice, and others the Brahman?. This, [they exclaimed,] is a doctrine which will not bear dis cussion ; the slaughter [of animals in sacrilico] is not conducive to religious merit. [To say that] oblations of butter consumed in the lire produce any future reward, is the assertion of a child. If India, after having attained to godhead by numerous sacrifices, feeds upon sami, and other woods, then an animal which eats leaves is superior to him. If it be a fact that a beast slain in sacrilico is exalted to heaven, why does not the worshipper slaughter his own father? If a man is really satiated by food which another person eats, then ?ruddhas should be offered to people who are travelling abroad, and I hey, trusting to this, should have no need to carry any food along with them.1 After it has been settled that this doctrine is entitled to credence, let the opinions which I express be pondered ami received as conducive to happiness. Infallible utterances do not, great Asuras, fall from the skies: it is only assertions founded on reason ing that are accepted by me, and by other [intelligent] persons like yourselves. Thus, by numerous methods, the Daityas were unsettled by the great Deceiver, so that none of them any longer regarded the triple Veda with favour. When the Daityas had entered on this path of error, the deities mustered all their energies, and approached to battle. Then followed a combat between the gods and the Asuras, and the latter, who had abandoned tho right road, were smitten by the former. In previous limes they had been defended by the armour of righteousness which they bore, but when that had boon destroyed they also perished." (il.) The following is Mm passage of the Kfunfiyana to which I i The satirical purport of this half-verse has not been correctly understood by Professor Wilson, who renders it thus :?"

In Sehlcgcl's edition, section 108 concludes with the 18th verse, which ?s immediately succeeded by the reply of Kama to Jfiviili's suggestions, in the 29 anushtubh verses, which Bland at the commencement of Rcction 109. To these are added nine more verses in a longer metre, the Upajdti, which Schlegel regards as spurious. As regards some of the verses his opinion is no doubt just; for Kama is represented in the first of these additional stanzas as a seeond time commencing his answer to JiivFdi, and the tone in which he then repudiates the sentiments of the latter is much harsher than in the earlier (.uius1?tubh) versea of tho section. In the ,'w.th and following verses of the addition, Jfivfdi is intro duced as apologizing for, and half recanting, the opinions he had expressed : ?"The Brahman then addressed to Kama these true, wholesome, and believing (ilstika) words :?' 1 do not utter the doctrines of the nihilists {nantikas) : 1 am not a nihilist; nor docs nought exist. Having regard to opportuneness of time, 1 have again become a believer {?stika), and on an opportune occasion l may again become a nihilist.'" In one of these Upajal i verses, the Buddhists arc expressly mentioned. Gorrcsio's edition, however, contains much more extensive interpolations than Schlcgel's. Ah wc have seen, stanzas 4?11, and 28 ? 31), of section 116 of Ihe former, are all in excess of the verses contained in the corre sponding section of the latter. But section 110 of Gorrcsio's edition docs not stop even there. It contains, in verses 40 H*., a short repudiation by Kama of Javilli's doctrines. Another discourse of Bhanita's follows in section 117, and it is not till scctioi? 118 that Kama is represente?! as beginning (a second time) the answer to .liiviili, which corresponds to that in section 109 of Schlcgel's edition. Carey and Marshman's text generally coincides (as regards the sections under consideration) with Gorrcsio's, though in some readings it agrees with Schlcgel's when that and Gorrcsio's diilcr. 1 will not here enter on the question, of which I have not. studied both sides, as to the comparative antiquity of Schlcgel's and Gorrcsio's texts*,, but I will adduce from the speech of Vas'ishtha in the 110th section of Schlcgel's edition, as compared with the corresponding section of Gorrcsio's, what I conceive to be one decided argument in favour of the greater antiquity of the former text. Wc there read (in Schlcgel's edition), " There was then nothing but water, in which the earth was formed. From thence was produced Brahma, the wlf existcnf, together with the deities, lie. then becoming a boar, raised up the earth, ami created the whole world, with his sons, who were perfected inspirit. Brahma was produced from the ether," ftc. It is therefore Bioland, who here becomes a boar, and in that form raises up the earth,?an incarnation and an act which arc elsewhere, as in the Vishnu Fur?na(pp. 27?32 of Wilson's translation), and in the Bhftgavata Purftno, i., 3, 7, and iii., 13, 18 IK, ascribed to Vishnu. To har monize the account in the R?rn?yana with that in the Pu ranas (which is to all appearance of later origin), the author of the recension edited by Gorrcsio changes the words Brahma svagambhur daivatais saha, " Brahma, the sclf cxiulcnt, with the gods," into Brahma svayamhhur Vishnnr avyaipdi, " Br.-ihiuft,</page><page sequence="10">308 VERSES FROM THE SARVA-DARSANA-SANGRAHA, &amp;C. As the doctrines, which in these verses are put into the mouth of the Brahman Jfiv?li agree essentially in their tenor with those ascribed to the Ch?rv?kas in the verses I have quoted from the Sarva-ditr?tina-sangraha, it would appear (if the section be genuine) that theme Materialists must he as olel as the compeisitiem of the Hfimfiyana, to whatever era that may be referred. Anel that a sect bearing that appellatiein must have cxiste?el at the time when the Mah?bh?rata rocoiveel its present form appears highly probable frenn the contents of the following passage from the San ti parva, or xiith Book, verses 1,11 I, if., in which a story is told about a Rfixasa or demon eif that name?, who was a conte;iuue;r eif the; Brahmans, and who, there can be little dembt, is meant to stand for a hostile sectary. After Yudhishthira had'entered the; city, anel hail bestowed largesses on the Bralnnaiis, &amp;c, the following scene is described as having taken place : " When the Brahmans were now again standing silent, Charvfika, the Rfixasa, in the disguise of a Brahman, aeldrcsscd the King. This friend of Duryodhana, concealed under the garb of a mendicant, with a rosary, a lock of hair on his crown, and a triple staff, impudent and fearless, surrounded by all the Brahmans, exceeding a thousand iu number, who were anxious te) utter their benedictions, ?men who practised austerity anel self-restraint,?this wretch, wishing evil to the magnanimous Pfuulavas, without saluting those Brahmans, thus addressed the King : * All these Brahmans, falsely imputing the malediction to me, themselves exclaim, Woe to you, wicked king, the slayer of your kindred. What can be the issue of this, son eif Kunti? Since you have slaughtered your kinsmen ami elelers, death is desirable for you, and neit life.' Hearing this speech of the wicked Rfixasa, the Brahmans were pained anel indignant, being maligned by his words. But they all, as well as King Yudhishthira, remained silent, being ashamed, anel cut to the heart. Then Yudhishthira said: -Let all your reverences be reconciled te&gt; me who bow down and supplicate you: you ought not to curse me who have recently [?] undergone so great mis the self existent, imperishable Vishnu ;" ami in a suhscepicnl line substitutes the words sachar?eharam avyayam, for saha putrair krit?tmabhih, i.e., " he created the whole imperishable world, movedde and immoveable," iiiHlead of "ho created the whole world, with his sons," &amp;c. This last alteration was rendered necessary by the fact that sonn are ascribed by mythological tradition to Brahimi, but none to Vishnu. When, therefore, the name of Vishnu ivas introduced, it became necessary to strike out all reference to sons. These alterations are not found in Carey and Marshinan's edition, which hero agrees with Schlegels.</page><page sequence="11">ON INDIAN MATERIALISTS. 309 fortunes.'

Whatever books, Rep?rate from the Vedas, spring up and disappear, are worthless and false, from their recentness of date." Such heretics appear to have been numerous at the period when these Institutes were compiled, as the faithful are warned (iv., Gl) against living in a village "over run with heretics;" a kingdom "in which Sfidras predominate, overrun with nihilists, and destitute of Rrahmans," is said (viii., 22) to be doomed to destruction ; a king who is a nihilist is threatened with perdition (viii., 309); and it is enjoined (ix., 225) that heretics shall be banished. Nihilism is, however, only pronounced (xi. GG) to be an upap?taka, or sin of lesser hoinousness. Allusion is ?aid to be made in v., 89, 90, and viii., 3G3, to female anchorets of an heretical religion. The anti-brahmanieal opinions here referred to are, however, most probably those of the Buddhists, though possibly sonic other sects may be included. It is evident from some of the hymns of the Veda (see Midler's Hist, of Ane. Sansk. Lit., p. 55G ft'.) that theological speculation has been practised in India from a very early period. In fact, the whole of these hymns, even those of theiii which are most artless, poetical, and anthropomorphic in their character, may, in a limited sense, be regarded as speculative ; since the religious ideas which they express, being founded on no external revelation, must have owed their existence not only to the religious emotions and imagi nation of their authors, but also to a certain exercise of reflection, which assigned particular attributes ami functions to the different deities, and proceeded on a certain theory of the relations of the Godhead to the universe. As, therefore, the religions or niytlio 1 Though reasoning ?h looked upon by Alaun (ii. 11,) ami other orthodox writings (e.g., Mah?bh?rata, iii. 13,-l(j.l, sushka tarka), with great jealousy, aa li'.cly to be employed against the Vedas, ?ta aitl ?h also invoked aa necessary for their defence and exposition (Manu, xii. 10ft), and professors of dillcrcnt systems ol lo^ic or speculation (haituka and turkin) are referred to (xii.

Kvcii after the Rrahmanical system had been more fmnly established, and its details more minutely prescribed, it is clear that the same strictness was not extended to speculation, but that if a Ihalunan was only an observer of the established ceremonial, and an assertor (?f the privileges of his own order, he might entertain and oven profess almost any philosophical opinion which he pleased (Cole brookc, Misc. Ess., i., 379 ; M?ller, Ane. Sansk. Lit. 79). In this way the tradition of free thought was preserved, and speculative principles of every character continued to be maintained and taught without hindrance or scandal. Meanwhile the authority of the Vedas had come to be generally regarded as paramount and divine, but so long as this authority was nominally acknowledged, inde pendent thinkers were permitted to propound a variety of specu lative principles, at variance with their general tenor, though perhaps not inconsistent with some isolated portions of their contents. It was only when the authority of the sacred books was not merely tacitly set aside or undermined, but openly discarded and denied, and the institutions founded on them were abandoned and assailed by the Buddhists, that the orthodox party took the alarm. Accordingly traces of a sceptical spirit are not wanting in the different, parts of Indian literature. In the Rig Veda, viii., 89, 3, 4, reference is made to some free thinkers who had doubted the existence of Indra. (See Original Sanskrit Texts, iii., 151.) In the Nirukta Yfiska refers to an older author, named Kautsa, who had spoken of the hymns of the Veda as being often unmean ing or contradictory (Original Sansk. Texts, ii. 180 ff.).

Burnouf (who is followed by Lassen, M?ller, and others) is of opuiieui that Sfikya merely carried on a work which hael been previously ceimmeuced by Kapila anel Palnnjali, anel proceeded upon the atheistical principles furnished te&gt; him by the former eif these philoseiphers.?(Bouddhisme Indien, pp. 211 ; 520.) This may be true, anel may be susceptible eif preieif from a comparison of the principles of these two systems, anel an examination of their mutual relations. In the meantime?, however, it is worthy eif remark that the Sfinkhya Sutras, i. 27?47, adduce and refute certain tenets which are those of the Buddhist scheieds. The opinions in question are, (1) the momentary duration eif external objects, which succeed each either in a perpetual flux (Sutras, 31, 35) ; (2) that things exist only in perception, and have no objective reality (Sutra, 42) ;! (3) that there is nothing but a void {?fini/a). All these doctrines arc those of the Buddhist schools (as described in Mr. Colebrooke's Essay on the Heretical Sects). The first doctrine is mentioned in p. 397 of that Essay, as Buddhist ; while the second is that eif the Yogfichfiras, and the third that of the Mfielhyamikas, who are both Bauddha sects, ibid. p. 391. (See also p. 380, where Mr. Colobrookc alludes to the Buddhists being noticed in the Sfinkhya.) If, therefore, the Sfinkhya Sutras are to be regarded as the original form iu which that system was prei poumh?el by its author, anel if they have remained free from inter pedatiein, the Sfinkhya must be later than Buddhism. It appears, however, to ho. prima facie very improbable that the S?tras eif the different phileiseiphical schools (whatever may be the age to which the earliest nucleus of each may be referred) should have; remained unaltered from the date eif their first ceimposition ; and the mutual references which arc to be found in the Brahma and the Sfinkhya Sutras, to each other's doctrines, totally precluele suedi a suppositiem. The Sutras must, therefore, cither have received interpolations at some period subsequent to their first coinpilatiem, eir they must be regarded as nothing more than later summaries of doctrines which 1 Sec Professor Rancijca's Dialogues on the Hindu philosophy, whero Sankara's refutation of this doctrine, the Vij?ana-v?da, is quoted from his commentary on the Brahma Sutras, ii., 2, 28.</page><page sequence="15">ON INDIAN MATERIALISTS. 313 had been handed down, either orally or in writing, from an earlier period. Mr. Oolebrooke, with his usual caution, does not determine whether or not the Buddhist doctrines are derived from those of Kapila, but merely notices the "strong resemblance" which the latter "manifestly bear to the opinions of the sects of Jina and Buddha" (Misc. Ess. i., 228). In another place (i., 378), he says no more than that the last-named sects " exhibit some analogy to the Srmkhyas." But it is not the systems of Buddha and of Kapila alone which are atheistic in their principles. Three of the other Daisanas, reputed more or less orthodox, or subdivisions of them, are known, or suspected, not without some appearance of reason, to have once professed the same opinions, or to profess them still. In his Dialogues on the Hindu philosophy, which have lately appeared, Professor K. M. Banerjea states his opinion (pp. Ill, ff) that the Ny?ya and Vaiseshika systems were originally atheistic, though their modern adherents have adopted a theistic creed.1 The wide prevalence of atheistic sentiments in the middle ages of Indian history (i.e., in the centuries subsequent to the com mencement of the Christian era) is, however, yet more distinctly shown by the remarkable fact that tenets of this description had, as the orthodox. Kumfirila himself confesses, in one of the intro ductory verses of his Vfu ttika,2 become in his day quite general among the adherents of the Pfirva M?mfuisii School, who thus strangely combined the two characteristics regarded by Manu and the Vishnu 1'uiTina as incompatible, namely, that recognition of the authority of the Veda, and strict observance of Vcdic ceremonies, which these works so strongly enjoin, with the nihilism, atheism, or materialism (n?stikya), which they so strenuously denounce. If we arc to understand from the term Lohhjata, applied by Kumfirila to the hostile section of the Miumnsakas, that they had abandoned the belief in a future life as well as in a God (as we, no doubt, should understand, and as 1 have been assured by Pandit Nehemiah Gorch, an intelligent and well-informed convert from Bralunaiusm to Christianity), then they have only practised their Vedic ceremonies 1 Sec also "Original Sanskrit Texts/' Part iii., p. 21G. 2 lie there says, "For the MiiufinsFi has generally been turned into a stdio'd of materialism (or atheism, lok?yal?krita), but I have made this attempt to bring it into the paths of theism (or the recognition of a future existence, ti*fika pathe).
