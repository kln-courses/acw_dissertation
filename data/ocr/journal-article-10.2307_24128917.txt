<plain_text><page sequence="1">On using animals as tools Thurman S. Grafton's response to our ar ticle, "Are Science Fairs Fair to Animals?" [Sept. TST, pp. 31-33] clearly displays misguided utilitarianism towards sen tient life. It is precisely this utilitarianism, which regards animals as mere "tools" for research and teaching purposes, that lim its the full educational potential of animal use in high schools. Utilitarians seek to maintain the re searcher's unquestioned right to do what ever he or she wishes to an animal, under the guise of medical progress or scientific knowledge. To question this right evokes a conditioned defensive reflex: one is immediately categorized as an anti vivisectionist, "employing the strategy of the 'big lie' ", to quote Dr. Grafton. If he had read our article with a clear and un biased mind, he would realize that it is hardly a plea for anti-vivisectionism! To label us as anti-vivisectionists effectively cuts off meaningful exchange, which may be a strategy to avoid discussing the real issues: our ethical responsibilities toward other living creatures, and the danger of indoctrinating children with utilitarian values and a Descartian (mechanistic), ego- (rather than eco-) centric world view. After crying "anti-vivisectionist," Grafton further evades the content of our article by suggesting that to be concerned about animal suffering is to be an thropomorphic. Clearly, he and others who label concern for pain and suffering in animals as being anthropomorphic, are ignorant of the fact that animals have pain receptors and nervous systems which, especially in vertebrates, are not unlike our own in terms of mediating pain re sponses and emotional states associated with suffering—notably fear and anxiety. All of this is scientifically well proven. To be concerned, therefore, about animal pain and suffering is both humane and scientifically valid. To dub it as an thropomorphic makes one wonder if some believe that we should only concern ourselves with an animal's capacity to ex perience pain and suffering if such a capacity is exactly like that of a human. Grafton also charged that we "blithely but purposefully neglected to mention the use of anesthetic, analgesic, or tranquiliz ing drugs where appropriate." There was no purposeful neglect in this regard: We considered it a minor issue compared to others, especially the needless repetition of well-documented research, and studies in which no amount of anesthesia, analgesia, or tranquilization, even if giv en, could alleviate suffering during ex perimentation—as in a toxicology project. I hope other more objective readers got our message: What is needed is a more thoughtful use of animals in the classroom, and, as offered in our bibliography, a wider range of projects that do not always necessitate direct physical intervention and/or destruction.
