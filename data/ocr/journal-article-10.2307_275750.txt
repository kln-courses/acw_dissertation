GRIFFIN FOREWORD DURING the field season of 1941-42, joint excavations were undertaken in the Huas- teca territory by the American Museum of Nat- ural History and the Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia.1 The American Mu- seum had appointed Dr. Gordon Ekholm to investigate this area as a part of the program sponsored by the Institute of Andean Research. The Instituto Nacional appointed Wilfrido Du Solier to collaborate with Ekholm because of his (Du Solier's) long interest in and knowledge of the area. It was decided to undertake work in the fol- lowing sites: Las Flores in Tampico; Tancol, a little to the north of Tampico; Panuco, on the river of the same name; and Buena Vista, Huaxcama, San Luis Potosi, to the northwest of the Huasteca territory. The explorations in Buena Vista and Las Flores were made by both Ekholm and Du Solier, while those of Panuco and Tancol, due to the illness of Du Solier, were made only by Ekholm. Because of this, it 1 Ekholm, 1944. was decided that Du Solier would study Buena Vista and Las Flores, and Ekholm, Panuco and Tancol. Only the material from Buena Vista will be presented in this paper because of the special interest it has with regard to relationships to the north and because it complements certain phases of the recent field work of MacNeish in Tamaulipas.2 The report of the site, the classifi- cation of the pottery, and the relations with the cultures of Mexico have been prepared by Du Solier,3 while the relations with the southeastern United States have been prepared by Griffin, Krieger, and Du Solier.

Also, I wished to investigate the possibilities that the Huasteca originated in the Mississippi Valley, or else immigrated toward the southeastern United States. The excavations previously undertaken in the territory of the Huasteca have supplied us with abundant material for understanding the high type of culture achieved in this area and have made it possible to refer to cultural con- nections between the Huasteca and the south of Mexico. Unfortunately, however, they have not enabled us to determine comparable relation- ships to the north of Mexico, i.e., with the southeastern United States. Few points of relationship or common ideas between Mexican cultures and those to the north of the Rio Grande have been established. They include features of theocratic ideology, certain similarities between breast plates of shell, and some artistic concepts of the Mixteca- Puebla culture during the period after the founding of historic Tula of the Toltecs in the state of Hidalgo. In this paper are presented additional points of contact between the Huasteca area and the Caddoan cultures of Texas and Oklahoma. Description of the Zone The archaeological zone of Buena Vista is one of the most northwesterly points explored in the territory which could have been occupied by the prehistoric Huasteca culture. It is located approximately between the parallels 100? 28' west longitude and 22? 32' north latitude. It lies 70 kilometers due east of the city of San Luis Potosi. The land on which the structures are built is calcareous and has very little vegetation and running water. The inhabitants have to resort to dams and reservoirs in order to obtain rain water. The vegetation is almost exclusively mesquite and cactus. This low region is en- circled with a series of small lakes which often degenerate into swamps. The mounds are scattered about with no ap- parent regularity, appearing solely to form a small central square surrounded by mounds of varying heights and dimensions. The majority are circular at the base (Fig. 2). On the surface of the ground a great quantity of potsherds can be seen and future stratigraphic pits will un- doubtedly produce evidence for ceramic differ- ences during the occupation of the site. Structures Although the study of the Huasteca mound at Buena Vista has already been published separately,4 it is necessary to give a brief de- scription of the edifices which provided the pot- tery types presented in this paper, with, of course, additional information regarding the provenience of this pottery. The first structure explored was provisionally designated by the letter A, and is a circular structure built with sandstone slabs set with clay, arranged in the form of a circular enclosure without any visible entrance (Fig. 2). The slabs are aligned more or less regularly. The stone slabs seem to have been shaped on one surface so that the exterior view of the en- closure presents a partial homogeneity, and the same occurs in the interior face of the wall, since it was built of a double ring of stones (Fig. 2). This fact supports the idea that the structure was used as an enclosure, though its dimensions make it difficult to believe that it had a roof made from the material available at the time. During the course of the explorations, remains of wood were found, but it was not determined whether these remains were from a ceiling or from a wall of wood that had been fixed in the circular stone structure. Whether this structure served as a habitation or as a substructure of a building, is not certain from our work, nor could it be determined that it was a tomb, if such a name can be applied to a place which serves to shelter the mortal re- mains of man. The structure had no entrance, which makes it difficult to believe that it was used as a habitation. There are two reasons against considering it a substructure: first, the interior face of the wall is half-hewn; and sec- ond, the wall, outside as well as inside, is per- pendicular and therefore does not present as much resistance against thrust as if it were sloped, as are the majority of the Huasteca con- structions used as supports. The second structure explored has been desig- nated B, and is quite large, having a rectangular base, two of whose sides are considerably longer than the others (Fig. 2). Access to the upper part was by means of eight stairs, of which we have excavated three, two of them almost completely destroyed. The profile of this structure can be seen in the illustration. The orientation of the two long sides is roughly north-south.

In concluding this section, we wish to state that while structures A and B were built with stone of the same quality and set in mud, no trace was found of a plaster coat covering these structures, although in Mound 8 (Fig. 2) we observed the use of stucco. Ceramics The pottery studied in the present section was obtained from the interior and exterior of structure A and from the exterior of B. It will be treated as a unit here, but in a later section we will endeavor to distinguish an "artificial stratigraphy" in the rubble of A. The names that we assign to the different types of pottery are not based exclusively on the clay, but rather on the exterior appearance, for the color of the vessels may be that of the clay or of the slip applied to it. Bay ollas with red stripes. These vessels were made of red clay with temper which is visible to the naked eye. The firing was incomplete in the majority of the sherds recovered. The complete shape cannot be definitely determined, but the fragments indicate a globular body and a neck with several variants, as can be appreciated by comparing the cross sections on Plates I, B, q, r, u, v; and I, c, b. Some examples have flaring necks; some have a straight body with slight undulations on the exterior surface as in Plate I, B, p. The decorations of these vessels consists of a yellowish-white slip bearing brownish-red bands which encircle the vessel at the junction of the neck with the body of the vessel. In addition to the horizontal bands, some vessels have radial and irregular stripes which run down the ex- terior surface of the body. Bay ollas without red stripes. This type is a variant of the preceding one. The specimens have the yellowish--rhite slip but lack the red decoration. Their shapes are also similar to those of the first type, with '- significandly high proportion of vertical neck for,ns (Fl. I, c, j.-l, s). The interesting thing about the two foregoing types is that the ollas decorated with red bands resemble the type "ollas of bay clay with two red stripes" found at Tajin in central Vera Cruz.5 The style of decoration at Buena Vista, 6 Du Solier, 1939a, 1945a. however, differs from that at Tajin. The first type, as well as the second, seems to be very abundant in the zone, and if our stratigraphy is correct, this pottery was used more during the early occupation, later being replaced by other stronger but less artistic ollas. Bay ollas with double-grooved necks. This type also has connections with the ceramics of Tajin and even with Cholula in the state of Puebla; but it is pertinent to say that while the forms are similar in the three localities, the clay and slip are different. In coloration, the double-grooved type of Buena Vista is like the two previous types, oc- curring in both the decorated and undecorated varieties (P1. I, B, s, t). The grooves which en- circle the neck of the ollas are shallower than in the comparable types from Tajin and Cholula. The body of the vessel is smooth and has re- ceived the same yellowish-white slip as the neck. The clay is red with visible tempering particles, and is well fired. Bay cups [tecomates, according to Du Solier]. This type appears to be indigenous to the Buena Vista area and varies only in shape from the previous types. The form is, as its name indicates, a bowl [cajete] whose borders curve inward in such a manner that the orifice is smaller than the greatest diameter of the ves- sel's body (P1. I, c,f-i). The upper rim generally has a bevel forming an angle with the interior wall of the vessel. Included in this type are some specimens with a peripheral red band painted on the beveled rim. The type seems to be characteristic of the older period at Buena Vista. Large red bowls [cajetes]. Here, the clay is red with temper visible to the naked eye. There is a red slip which probably covered all of the in- terior of the vessel but was applied on the ex- te'ior only to the rim, which curves inward. The lower exterior surfaces were not polished be- cause of the utilitarian character of the vessel. The shapes of these bowls are limited and vary solely in the curvature of the rim. Some of them might be called cups [tecomates] because of the strong incurving of the rim (P1. I, c, c-e). Grayish-black vessels. This type of pottery undoubtedly has the greatest interest, not only because of its superior quality in relation to the other local types but also because it is this style and its variants which enable us to postulate a ceramic connection between northeastern Mexico and the southeastern United States. This type is also significant for the relation- 18 [1, 1947</page><page sequence="7">DU SOLIER, KRIEGER, AND GRIFFIN] THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL ZONE OF BUENA VISTA ships it shows with other zones of Mexico, mak- ing it possible to place the culture of Buena Vista in a more or less exact period. Because of their particular interest, we will discuss separately the variations of this pottery, describing now only the group that has no decoration but merely the identifying color. It is regarded as pottery of probably a reddish clay, but the action of the carbon in the smoke and the imperfect firing produced the black color. It is believed that the black color was ob- tained in the same manner as in the black pot- tery of Teotihuacan and Tajin in central Mexico, and also it might be said, of Panuco and El Prisco in the Huasteca. The carbona- ceous smoke produced in firing was allowed to penetrate the surface, and the latter was then polished to perfection. This rather elementary technique did not produce vessels of a uniform color; they are very black in some areas and greyish-brown in others. Hence, the ware is called grayish-black. For shapes, the reader is referred to Plate II, A, d-g. Although the pottery is quite fragmentary, we can say that the most common shape was a bowl with a flat base and outcurving sides. Small ollas can also be identified from their rim sherds, which are large and outcurving. Other fragments indicate the presence of bowls of com- pound silhouette and small ollas whose body walls form an angle on the side of the vessel. Grayish-black vessels, engraved or incised. This was the most abundant decorated type and in- cludes the vessels with the most elaborate deco- ration, where there seems to have been a special interest in attaining beautiful designs. We are including in this division the incised decoration made before the firing of the vessel, when the clay was still plastic; incision made when the clay was dry; and, finally, those specimens on which the decoration was made after the vessel had been fired, which is called engraving. Some- times this latter decoration was further em- bellished by rubbing red paint into the engraved lines. The designs can readily be divided into four groups, a division which we base not on tech- nique but on style. The first group comprises those designs which consist of two grooved, parallel lines extending horizontally around the upper rim of the vessel, leaving a small horizon- tal band between the lip and the lines. Immedi- ately below these two lines are geometrical fig- ures which often form triangles; these are either striated or plain (Pls. II, A, h, j; II, B, n, s). There are also parallel lines alternating with smooth spaces that seem to form S's (Pls. II, A, n; II, B, e). Another form of decoration does not have a regular form, but is simply engraved in order to interrupt the monotony of a smooth band (P1. II, A, 1, m). All these designs are bordered on the lower side by one or two paral- lel horizontal lines that also encircle the vessel. The designs of the second group have been placed immediately below a simple incised line that encircles the rim of the bowl. It appears that the motifs in this case range from simple irregular lines to others which have symbolic significance (P1. II, A, o, p). In the third group are included sherds whose designs consist of small hachured triangles placed above two horizontal lines. Below the lines are also found the S-shaped motif of the first group (P1. II, A, k). The fourth group contains all the sherds without rims. In these, there is great decorative diversity (Pls. II, A, a-c, r, s; II, B, o, q). As to the clay, it is in all respects similar to that of the plain grayish-black pottery, and we can say the same of the firing. With regard to shape, there seems to have been more variety, the bowls differing in almost all cases. Also, the cup [tecomate] appears to be present (P1. II, B, e). Greyish-black vessels, grooved (corrugated). This is another decorated form of the simple grayish-black pottery, resembling the latter in clay, polish, and firing. Its salient characteristic is the presence of horizontal (P1. II, B, a, d,f) or vertical (P1. II, B, c) grooves, and in some cases of a combination of the two (P1. II, B, b, o). The grooves are generally rather shallow, and they could well have their origin in the imitation of natural life forms such as the squash (gourd) so common in the Huastecan and Tarascan cul- tures. The polish of these vessels is very fine, either because greater care was taken in their manu- facture or on account of better raw material. Some of the vessels are obviously of a brownish color, but only fragments of these vessels were found, and it may well be that they represent the portion which received only a thin slip and naturally could acquire only a medium tone. Greyish-black vessels with basal angle. There was little variability in the shapes of these ves- sels, as they were limited to bowls with sides gently curving inward, almost forming cups [tecomate]. The vessels consisted of two parts, base and body, the body being so intimately 19</page><page sequence="8">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY linked with the neck that the one is no more than an uninterrupted continuation of the other. Between the bottom and the body a flange was made, generally as a part of the wall of the vessel. Nevertheless, we recovered some frag- ments indicating that this peripheral flange had been applied separately after the vessel had been constructed (P1. II, B, g, h). In the first case, or those in which the peripheral ring was built into the wall of the vessel, the flanges formed a true edge (P1. II, B, i, j). The clay is similar to that of the plain, greyish-black pottery, as are the polish and firing, although the temper is coarser than in the previous types. Vessels red on both sides. This pottery, whose slip ranges from red to orange, was manufac- tured from a red clay, perfectly fired, without visible temper. This allowed the production of strong, thin-walled elegantly shaped vessels. The most common forms are flat-bottomed bowls with outcurving sides, hemispherical bowls, and cups with small lugs of clay pinched from the vessel walls (P1. I, A, a-k). Vessels red inside and bay outside, or red out- side and bay inside. These two are incorporated in the same type; to separate them would com- plicate instead of simplify the classification. Whether inside or out, the clay and red slip are in all respects alike and, as was the case with the vessels red on both sides, the slip ranges in color from red to orange. The clay and shapes also seem to be like those of the previous type, with the addition of a vertical-walled bowl with a flat base (P1. I, A, e). Vessels red inside and bay outside, with red bands on the bay surfaces. This type also re- sembles the previous ones in clay, firing, and shape. But the idea of a contrasting decoration, particularly with the red and bay colors, brings to memory the classic Tula-Mazapan pottery, which we have already found represented, al- though with better defined characteristics, in the northeastern part of the Huasteca and, more exactly, during Period V at Panuco and in the pottery of Las Flores in Tampico (P1. I, A, n-s). Vessels bay inside and out, with red decoration. This sub-type is similar in clay, form, and firing to the above, but has a higher percentage of decoration. We discuss it separately because later studies may perhaps indicate that the dif- ference between the two styles is chronologi- cally significant (Pls. I, A, m; I, B, a-f). Black-red pottery. Few sherds of this type were found. The red color appears on the ex- terior and the black, on the interior. As to forms, these could not be determined, for the few small pieces that we found indicated only that the red-black sherds of Buena Vista show some analogies to the pottery of the same name also found by me at Tajin.6 Yellow vessels, undecorated. This name refers to the slip to be found on the outer surfaces of these specimens. Both the inner and outer sur- faces were first painted white, and then a yellow slip was added to the outer surfaces, a tech- nique which recalls the Cholultecan pottery that Noguera called "lacquered." Even though the two techniques are similar, the Cholula paint adheres more poorly than the Buena Vista paint. The forms are flat-bottomed bowls with outflaring walls, and small ollas with flar- ing rims. The clay is of excellent quality, with- out visible temper, and perfectly fired (P1. III, A, b, d-k). Yellow vessels with negative decoration. In clay, firing, form, and slip these specimens are identical with the ones discussed above. In ad- dition, they are decorated by the lost-wax or negative process of painting (P1. III, A, c). Engraved orange vessels. We found only a few fragmentary examples of this type at Buena Vista, which is unfortunate on account of the relationships which the type reveals, as ex- plained below. The specimens consist of small sherds of hemispherical bowls. This pottery is named orange for the color of its clay; either it did not receive a slip or the slip has been eroded. The decoration, made when the clay was plastic, consists of geometri- cal motifs incised very lightly (P1. III, A, a). White-red pottery. Very few types are as diffi- cult to locate as this one. It may be considered sort of a "ceramic globetrotter," whose culture and provenience cannot be determined so far. Examples have been found in zones far re- moved from one another, but always in such small percentages as to bar any attempt to as- certain the origin of the type. In the present case only one sherd was found, whose shape might have been that of a hemi- spherical bowl. The clay is of excellent quality, with perfect firing, the slip having been applied to the exterior and the red coloration to the in- terior (P1. III, A, m). Lacquered pottery. These potsherds have been 6 Du Solier, 1945a. 20 [1, 1947</page><page sequence="9">[DU SOLIER, KRIEGER, AND GRIFFIN] PLATE III A B C Artifacts from various sites, San Luis Potosi, Mexico.

Because of the very bad condition of their in- terior, it was impossible to ascertain whether they were originally polychrome or not; only a white background with red and orange spots can be perceived. The outside is generally orange-yellow. Due to the smallness of the frag- ments, their shapes cannot be determined. Coarse utilitarian vessels, undecorated. As the name indicates, no special care was taken in the manufacture of these vessels, beyond that of a utilitarian character, but the exterior was polished with some care, resulting in the elimi- nation of water seepage as far as possible. Therefore, these vessels might have been used to contain liquids. Coarse pottery with red slip. The function of these pieces is difficult to determine. While the clay and firing suggest utility pottery, the presence of decoration implies a special usage. In addition to these specimens, there are a series of sherds which have lost their original appear- FIG. 3. Burial positions of seven skeletons. necessary for its use. The clay is strong; the firing is imperfect; there is visible temper with, possibly, traces of mica. The outer surfaces have been smoothed and both the outer and inner surfaces of some sherds are polished. The shapes are those of big bowls or ollas with out- flaring rims (P1. I, c, m-q, t, u, x). Coarse utilitarian vessels with lined decoration. The exteriors of these sherds show that, either by chance or deliberately, the tools used in their manufacture streaked the surfaces, like brushes, while the clay was still plastic. The forms, clay, and firing seem to have been similar to those of the previous type (P1. I, c, v, w, y). Coarse, polished pottery. This pottery is also ance in the course of time, the identifiable fea- tures including only the clay or traces of polish or color. Other Artifacts Because of the scarcity of implements of stone and bone, we are discussing both under the same heading. We recovered two stone axes, one of them being more like an adze (P1. III, B, a, b). Also, we obtained a small mortar (P1. III, B, m), two metate fragments, better called "huilanches" because they do not have legs (P1. III, B, 1, n), and one finely grained polisher (P1. III, B, k), all of volcanic stone. There were three arrow points made of red stone, whose 21</page><page sequence="12">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY forms can be seen on Plate III, B, c-e. Only two bone artifacts were discovered. The first (P1. III, B, h) is indubitably a fragment of an awl (graver); the second (P1. III, B, j) is another fragment of an awl of the type known as omechicahuastli. In ending this section, we will mention the presence of clay figurines (P1. III, c, c, d), pipes (P1. III, c, h, i), and a head in the form of a rattle (P1. III, B,,, g). Burials Since this report deals principally with the structure A. The study of the crania did not offer any details that would serve to identify the ethnic type; thus we had to rely on the pottery to identify the culture that pertained to the burials in question. The depth of the burials varied between 20 and 40 centimeters; their orientations may be observed in Figure 3. Comparisons We will now analyze the various types of Buena Vista pottery and will endeavor to identify them if possible with similar types in other parts of the Huasteca region and with TABLE 2.

The clay em- ployed at Buena Vista is native to the region. Thus we may consider the two types to be the product of influence rather than of trade, as would have been the case if the Buena Vista vessels had been made from a clay similar to Tajin. If the differentiation of structure A into three levels is chronologically significant, it in- dicates that the bay ollas with red stripes are early, because the greatest number of examples were found in the deepest levels (Table 2). The pottery without red decoration has a similar distribution, indicating it to be an ancient product of the region. We can also add that this type seems to be native to Buena Vista because it has not been found to date in Tajin, or in any other part of Mexico. As for the bay ollas with double-grooved rims, we have already indicated in the descrip- tive section that there is a strong resemblance in form, clay, and coloration to similar pottery from Tajin and Cholula. This resemblance must signify either a common idea or a common cul- ture in the three places. The large red bowls seem to have connections only in the north of the Huasteca. Thus, we will see that Ekholm finds this type in his Period IV at Panuco, although the dimensions of the Panuco bowls are smaller than at Buena Vista. Both at Las Flores and Tampico, Ekholm and I were able to identify similar types that prob- ably represent the ancestors of the Buena Vista type. I have also found them with certain char- acteristic variations in an archaic period at El Ebano in San Luis Potosi. Of all the types found in Buena Vista, we can without hesitation say the grayish-black is the most important, for it is found in different parts of Mexico, apparently as a part of diverse cul- tures. In discussing this type we will refer also to the variants that were described above-the vessels decorated with engraving or incising, those with grooves, and we can even include two fragments of anthropomorphic vessels made of a clay colored black (P1. III, c, k, m). The black pottery without decoration cannot be very rigidly compared with other forms, as it does not have a very characteristic silhouette. We will only point out that this pottery is char- acteristic of the Teotihuacan culture, princi- pally during Periods II and III, and that similar types are encountered in Tajin, where they are contemporaneous with Teotihuacan. As we have indicated elsewhere,9 this type may be the result of rather late influence from Teotihuacan. The engraved or incised black pottery has its most direct Mexican connections with the pot- tery of the same type in Tajin, and also in some respects with the pottery of Period IV that Ekholm calls "Zaquil Black Incised" (P1. IV) and which, in his work on Panuco, he considers contemporaneous with Teotihuacan.10 We were very surprised to find that the greyish-black, grooved pottery is present in Teotihuacan I, an exceedingly ancient epoch, and that it might have lasted until Period II. The basal angle type, which we have also in- cluded in the greyish-black group, may have been inspired by the pottery which Noguera includes in the orange pottery group with the following words: "A peculiar detail of this type, even though it sporadically occurs in those of brown-colored sherds, is that of having a series of incision-like notches on the angle formed be- tween the rim and the body of the vessel.... this detail is peculiar to the vessels of the archaic period of Ticoman and Zacatenco, and it is likewise found in Tarascan specimens."" This does not of course mean that our Buena Vista sherds must have originated at Teoti- huacan; we are merely pointing to the similarity of ideas. Panuco is another site in which vessels and cups with precisely this basal angle have been found, among the pottery of Ekholm's Period IV which he calls "Zaquil Red."12 This Panuco type may well have been more closely connected with ours of Buena Vista. The two sherds shown on Plate III, c, k, m seem to have analogies with anthropomorphic vessels of the classic Huasteca Black-on-White pottery, for which, unfortunately, we do not as yet have sufficient data to establish a chronol- ogy to determine its exact origin. Although it may seem absurd to continue reiterating connections between Buena Vista and Tajin, the pottery painted red on both sides again parallels that of Tajin; the colora- tion and the slip are the same in both, the thick- nesses of the vessels are also alike, and many of the forms are similar. Only the clay differs; although it is very fine in Buena Vista, its quality is even better at Tajin. 9 Du Solier, 1945a. 10 Ekholm, 1944. n Noguera, 1935a, p. 20. 12 Ekholm, 1944. 23</page><page sequence="14">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Pottery related to the orange-red ware of Buena Vista seems to be characteristic of the Huasteca region and in general of the cultures that flourished the length of the Gulf of Mexico. Itemizing sites, this type is found to the west of Buena Vista, at a place called Tamuin in San Luis Potosi, and even further toward the coast at Tamos; northwardly we found similar pot- tery as far as Tula, Tamaulipas; to the south the most distant point where I have seen it is at Medellin, Vera Cruz; in addition, Juan Valen- zuela seems to have found some, although with slight modifications, at "Los Tuxtlas." It is still premature to determine the period to which this pottery belongs; at Tajin, the same type first appears in the deep layers and continues until the last period. The pottery red inside, bay outside, and vice versa, has its closest connection with Tajin pot- tery, which it resembles in the colors employed, although the forms are different. At Tajin, it is one of the most ancient types, corresponding to Teotihuacan II and III. The bay and red-bay pottery, in which the bay face is decorated with red, could be a re- flection of the Tula-Mazapan complex. How- ever, our Buena Vista type seems to be earlier than that of Tula, inducing us, in this case, to accept it as the ancestor of the Mazapan or Toltecan pottery. The black-red type seems to be foreign to the locality, and could have been brought from a region such as Tajin where it is more charac- teristic. We find a parallel in technique and coloration to the yellow pottery in Cholula, even though the shapes are different there. We have cor- related several types which existed in Tajin with the orange pottery, because the interior had this color. In view of the discoveries at Buena Vista, however, they could more easily be incorporated in this yellow type on account of its form and color. In any case, the yellow pottery seems to be more characteristic of Buena Vista than of Tajin. We cannot consider it as a florescence of Cholula, for its appearance in Buena Vista seems to be characteristic of the oldest period. If, in addition to the age of the yellow pot- tery, we note that it is decorated by negative painting, we must accept it as belonging to an older period than the lacquered pottery of Cholula. We are inclined to consider it con- temporaneous with the negative-decorated pot- tery of Tajin. The engraved orange pottery is undoubtedly a type of Tajin. Both there and at Buena Vista it is a recent product. Little remains for us to add to what has been said about the white-red pottery, except that the sites where this type has appeared are Los Tuxtlas, Tres Zapotes, Isla de Sacrificios, and Tajin. It is most characteristic of the latter. Very little can be said of the type that we call lacquered, as the sherds are extremely deteri- orated. We find no better comparison than the Mixteca-Puebla lacquered pottery. A major analysis of the utilitarian pottery is omitted, as it is more or less common to all of our Mexican cultures. As for bone artifacts, awls of this material are found from the archaic cultures to the most recent periods of the Nahuas. Therefore, these finds do not provide us with any characteristics for chronological placement. Fragments of omichicahuaztli have also been found in different sites and as implements of different cultures, but they seem to be rather characteristic of middle and modern cultures (in archaeological terms). Of the small clay bells, little can be noted besides the characteristics that the omichica- huaztli also present. However, we understand that they were quite common among the Mixteca. The pipes in Plate III, c, h, i are in- dubitably of a late period on account of their peculiar form. Although we ourselves did not find pipes of the platform type, we were shown various stone pipes of this form in the private collection of Lic. Don Primo Feliciano-Velasquez from a re- gion near Buena Vista called Cuecillos (P1. III, c, a, b). Others were found not very far to the north in the archaeological zone of Guadalcazar, in which Ekholm and I encountered surface pottery like that of Buena Vista. Conclusions This section is divided into two parts, the first of which embodies the conclusions stem- ming logically from the relationships of the Buena Vista archaeological finds to the cultures of the rest of Mexico and the second endeavors to present conclusions based on a comparison of the Buena Vista complex with the cultures of the southeastern United States. Owing to the fact that it was not possible to distinguish "natural stratigraphy" at Buena Vista, some of our conclusions will have to be stated tentatively. Nevertheless, the typologi- 24 [1, 1947</page><page sequence="15">DU SOLIER, KRIEGER, AND GRIFFIN] THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL ZONE OF BUENA VISTA cal study of both the pottery and other minor items, such as the architectural characteristics of the structures and the system of burials, give the conclusions more definitive status. If the stratigraphy for structure A is ac- cepted, two more or less definite phases can be segregated, probably corresponding to two different epochs. The older one is marked by the pottery type that we have named yellow, for the latter is not found either on the surface of this area nor in the first level of the "artificial" stratigraphy in structure A. Although different in shape, this type presents a certain analogy to the pottery of Cholulteca I in technique and coloration. One other type seems to belong solely to the old period: the grooved, grayish-black pottery. The characteristics of this type are not distinc- tive enough to give a clear indication as to its contemporaneity or connection with other Mexi- can cultures. On the other hand, as we have stated above, it was not found either on the surface or in the upper levels of structure A, and therefore we are somewhat inclined to be- lieve that it represented an ancient variety whose forms and techniques might possibly have been superseded by the other grayish- black pottery types-the smooth and the in- cised or scraped ones, although these two are found in greater abundance in deeper strata than in the recent levels. Both the smooth and the scraped or incised grayish-black pottery (the latter being contemporaneous with the yellow type), seem to have rather intimate parallels with Tajin II pottery.13 The black pottery with a basal edge is a variety that, in the Meso-American region, is generally rather old but reappears, after a very prolonged absence, in the archaeologically re- cent cultures. As discussed below, we believe that its contacts lie with the similar vases from the southeastern United States. The pottery red inside and bay outside, with red on the bay surfaces, also appears in the oldest period, lapses during intermediate times, and reappears, on a smaller scale, in the last period. This leads us to believe that the people inhabiting the Buena Vista archaeological zone first produced the type very abundantly, then largely replaced it with a different one, and finally returned to it again. To ascribe the red-on-bay pottery to a definite culture constitutes a difficult task. Al- though found at Tajin only in an ancient period, u Du Solier, 1945a. it seems that this pottery went through three stages which were widely distributed in Mexico. During the first of these, the red and bay colors were used in nearly equal proportions, that is to say that the area of the red surface is more or less equivalent to that of the bay, as it is found on some of the oldest Monte Alban vases, on those of the archaic culture of the Valley of Mexico, and even in the oldest periods of Tarascan pottery. In the second stage, the red decoration is very irregularly applied; in some cases it may possibly correspond to Teotihuacan III. The third and more characteristic stage is that in which the vases generally have a bay base, on which the red decoration is added by means of red lines, with designs that are per- fectly delineated and somewhat geometrical in character. This stage includes the Coyotlatelco pottery.14 Almost parallel to this pottery, and probably a derivative of it, is the pottery widely known under the name of Mazapan, similar in its decoration to that of Coyotlateco but show- ing an inferior polish and having motifs less geometrically arranged, limited almost to thin parallel lines and very often undulating ones.'5 To assign our Buena Vista pottery to any of these three general stages is a difficult matter, for it seems rather to be a regional complex. Nevertheless if we must try to do it, we would be rather inclined to ascribe it to the latest period, contemporaneous, therefore, with the Tula Toltec epoch in Hidalgo. In brief, Buena Vista's oldest stage might be placed between Teotihuacan IV and the Mazapan pottery of Tula, fluctuating thus between the dates 900 and 1200 A.D. Buena Vista's last stage might then be tenta- tively placed between the years of 1200 and 1350. To arrive at these last dates, we rely on the presence, although limited, of the orange in- cised pottery which is very abundant in the last period on the Isla de Sacrificios in southern Vera Cruz and likewise in the last period at Tajin in central Vera Cruz. Were we to assign a culture to the makers of this Buena Vista pottery, we would have to rely not solely on the ceramics, but also on the data provided by architecture and minor items. The Buena Vista architecture must be ascribed to the Huastec culture, on account of its building system, the materials used for construction, and the shape of the buildings themselves. 14 Tozzer, 1921, pp. 51-3; Noguera, 1935a, pp. 15-53. 16 Linne, 1934. 25</page><page sequence="16">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY With reference to the pottery, excepting cer- tain types such as the yellow and the lacquer vessels, and those red inside, bay outside with red-on-bay decoration, all the others are abun- dantly found in the Huastec region. Even if some of these types apparently present some in- fluences from central Mexican cultures, the in- fluences are hardly strong enough to postulate that the people who created Buena Vista pot- tery came from central Mexico; rather, we should say that the Buena Vista inhabitants were Huastecs who had, somewhere, somehow, experienced a certain contact with central Mexican peoples and cultures, and undoubtedly with those of the southeastern United States. As to other artifacts, such as bone objects, arrow points, "metates," etc., these also seem to be a product of the Huastec people with in- fluences rather from the north than from the south of Buena Vista. The second part of these conclusions consists merely of some observations of my own, reached independently from those of Dr. James B. Griffin and Alex Krieger while at the First Symposium on the Caddoan Archaeological Area at the University of Oklahoma during September, 1946. In the course of these discussions I had the opportunity to examine the ceramic contribu- tions of Orr, Krieger, Webb, MacNeish, Baer- reis, and Newkumet, shown at the lectures, and I could then discern the existence of relationship between two southeastern United States cul- tures, Caddoan and Spiro, and the northeastern region of Mexico, with special reference to the Huastec area. These observations were made after the com- pletion of my study of the Buena Vista pottery, and therefore are not included with my main comparisons. As I intend to make a detailed analysis of the cultures of southeastern United States and northeastern Mexico, I want merely to present here some preliminary observations. The relationships observed between the Caddoan and Huastec cultures are listed here- with: 1. Black vases, well polished, with incised decoration, sometimes scraped, and with red pigmentation in the inci- sions, are found in the Caddoan culture, at Buena Vista, and in Panuco IV (of the Huasteca). These vessels differ somewhat in shape from place to place, and in the last area seem to have lacked red pigmentation, as noted above. 2. Black pottery with scraped decoration, consisting of a red checkered pigmentation, is found both at Buena Vista and in the Caddoan and Spiro cultures. One of its decorative motifs, a succession of S-like shapes, is very common both in Caddo area and at Panuco IV, and is likewise found on the fresco murals of Tamuin in San Luis Potosi, and in the Huastec area.16 3. Zoomorphic vases, mainly in the shape of frogs, occur in the central Mississippi Valley; at Tampico, where they are rather abundant; and at the Isla de Sacrificios in the southern portion of the state of Vera Cruz. 4. Negative painting is found at several points in the southeastern United States as well as in Mexico. In the Caddoan area, it seems to be merely on trade specimens; from the central Mississippi Valley; on the other hand, decoration with the lost wax technique is common in northeastern Mexico, having been found at Panuco, Buena Vista, and Tajin. This technique constitutes a highly significant trait, because it is seemingly a characteristic of the older Mexican cultures. Its unquestioned persistence has been ascertained only up to the Tula-Mazapan period; a very few later specimens have been recovered, but there is considerable doubt as to the actual presence of the technique on these pieces. 5. Vases with an outflaring edge, circumscribing them, were found by Mrs. Hodges in the Caddoan area of Arkansas. The same ornamental motif is also present on Buena Vista pottery. In the majority of the Meso-American vases, this element seems to be early; it is found at Monte Alban I and II; at Ebano, San Luis Potosi; at Panuco II; in the Chicanel period of Uaxactun; and at other sites. 6. Vases from the Fourche Maline complex of southeast Oklahoma, which have scraped decoration on their upper parts in the form of hatched triangles, are likewise char- acteristic of Buena Vista pottery, are found in Panuco IV and V, and are very abundant at Tajin among the ollas with a double circular groove and those with red bands. 7. Cross-shaped ornamental motifs are found on Cad- doan pottery and shell pectorals; on the black Panuco IV pottery; on the black Tajin pottery found by us; on the shell pectorals of Las Flores, Tampico; on the earplugs of the personages of the Tamuin frescos; and, lastly, on the bases of Ekholm's Period VI pottery, painted black-on-beige, and in the vessels of the same decoration found at Tampico. 8. Clay pipes with conical bowls and small frontal handles are found at Buena Vista and in four late foci of the Caddoan area: Mid-Ouachita (Cahinnio), Tex- arkana, Titus, and Belcher. In the Titus focus there are also clay pipes with conical bowls and with two small pro- truding legs, similar to the ones found in the last period at Las Flores, Tampico. 9. "Platform" stone pipes, so characteristic of the Spiro culture, have been found at Guadalcazar near Buena Vista in Huaxcama. 10. Another custom which was apparently common to both regions is that of contemporaneous collective burial, seen at Buena Vista and in several of the Caddoan foci. 11. Cremation was used at El Ebano, San Luis Potosi in the Huastec region. Although this is an archaic site, further field work might reveal the persistence of the custom into more recent times, as seems to be the case in the Spiro cul- 16 Du Solier, 1946c. 26 [1, 1947</page><page sequence="17">DU SOLIER, KRIEGER, AND GRIFFIN] THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL ZONE OF BUENA VISTA tures, where Dr. Orr reported the use of such a practice. 12. Perhaps one of the most characteristic traits of both the Huastecs and the people of the southeastern United States was the "offering" of human skulls. In the Huastec region this trait has been found at Tamposoque, San Luis Potosi, and in the Tamuin murals, a fact which corroborates the assertion of the Spanish chroniclers that the Huastecs were accustomed to gather the severed heads of their ene- mies instead of making prisoners. This type of concept seems to have been common throughout the southeastern United States, where it is found expressed by means of engraved shells. 13. Conches cut so as to form an ehecacozcatl were found both in the northern part of the Huastec area and in the Allen and Sanders foci of northeast Texas. 14. The archaeological structures of the southeastern United States and the Huastec region both include basal platforms, or buildings, consisting of a series of several "stories" of thoroughly rammed clay superimposed and afterwards fired in situ. In the Huastec region this idea seems to have been limited to the older periods. 15. Finally, we have to report the presence of two other common traits, even if they do not possess a striking indi- viduality: canoes represented in clay, and specially shaped bone drills. These specific similarities, which came to my attention during the three days of the confer- ence, could very well serve as a starting point for much more detailed research. They might possibly lead to the filling of gaps and to the precise definition of connections between the prehispanic cultures which flourished in Mexico, in particular in the Huastec region, and those of Texas, southeastern Oklahoma, southwestern Arkansas, and northwestern Louisiana. WILFRIDO DU SOLIER Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia Mexico, D.F. April, 1947 THE BUENA VISTA CERAMIC COMPLEX AND ITS CONNECTION WITH THE CADDOAN AREA The major value of Du Solier's description of the discoveries at Buena Vista probably lies in its presentation of new material on a prehistoric culture in a part of northern Mexico which has long been neglected. It is also, however, of con- siderable interest to the archaeology of the eastern United States, for when taken in con- junction with the recent work of MacNeish in Tamaulipas, and Krieger on the "Caddoan" area, the Buena Vista culture appears to have important bearing on the time and direction of certain phases of culture borrowing between the high civilizations of Mexico and tribes of the southeastern United States. Archaeologists have long been puzzled and intrigued by the ceramic complex most com- monly called "Caddoan." It was part of Holmes Lower Mississippi Valley province and con- sidered by him a division of his Middle Mis- sissippi wares.17 More recently, a general "Caddoan complex" has been held to represent a Lower Mississippi phase of the Mississippi pattern by a few archaeologists. The term "Caddoan," as used in ceramic connections, usu- ally implies a strikingly rich array of vessel forms characterized principally by common use of engraved decoration (lines incised after polishing and firing), but also including incis- ing, punctating, gouging, pinching, and plain surfaces. The bulk of such pottery is found in the adjacent states of Louisiana, Arkansas, Texas, and Oklahoma, but as will be shown, the decorative technique also extends across the Mississippi into Alabama, and north into the central Mississippi Valley. In his study of village site collections in Mississippi and Louisiana, Ford pointed out that the "Caddo complex" extended into his- toric times, but there was also evidence of inter- influence with the prehistoric Coles Creek complex.'8 He also indicated a possible evolu- tion of certain Marksville decorative styles into the Caddoan complex, and of Coles Creek into Caddo.l9 In their paper on the Crooks site in Louisiana, Ford and Willey stated: "It can now be demonstrated that in the Lower Missis- sippi Valley the later cultural stages, Troyville, Coles Creek, Caddoan, and the west coast of Florida develop- ments, Weeden Island, and Safety Harbor, derived mainly from the cultural base provided by the Marksville (the local Hopewellian) stage."20 This rather confident and embracing state- ment was reaffirmed in the same authors' syn- thesis of eastern United States prehistory, where they suggested that the Caddoan com- plex was not formed until after 1540 and was derived mainly from the lower Mississippi Val- ley sequence of Marksville, Troyville, and Coles Creek.2" 17 Holmes, 1903, pp. 101-4, P1. IV. 18 Ford, 1936, p. 254. 19 Ibid., pp. 262-8. 20 Ford and Willey, 1940, p. 143. 21 Ford and Willey, 1941, p. 353. 27</page><page sequence="18">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY In the papers of Clarence H. Webb little at- tempt was made to discuss the origins of Cad- doan ceramics, but he has demonstrated significant chronological differences within the Caddoan complex as defined by Ford for north- western Louisiana.22 In a recent paper Krieger23 has briefly men- tioned two culture horizons in the "Caddo area," and correlated them with recognized horizons in the Plains and Mississippi Valley. The Spiro focus, with its ceremonial efflores- cence, is included in the earlier of the two hori- zons, which Krieger states had developed well before 1500. Intrusive Puebloan sherds in northern and northeastern Texas were men- tioned in support of such a dating. In a subse- quent publication, issued by the Universityof Texas, Krieger treats the problems of cross-ties with the Puebloan Southwest in detail.24 Strong evidence is presented for a greater age of cul- tures in the "Caddo area" than was allowed by the interpretations of Ford and Willey. By this dating, the highly developed ceramic complex of the later Caddoan horizon would have been present in northeast Texas and the adjoining states by 1400 A.D., and that of the earlier horizon by perhaps 1100 A.D. In both cases some time would have to be allowed for the cultures to develop, unless they had moved into the area en masse from elsewhere. It has been mentioned that an outstanding feature of "Caddoan" ceramic complexes is the use of engraved lines made after the vessel had been fired and polished. Pigments were often rubbed into such lines and usually contrast pleasingly with the background; red ochre was most commonly used, but white, green, and blue clays also appear. Such a technique is not known in the early ceramic periods of the east- ern United States, even in the lower Mississippi Valley. Its earliest appearance in the United States can, with reason, be safely ascribed to the general "Caddo area," probably to one of the five foci (Spiro, Sanders, Haley, Gahagan, and Alto) which Krieger includes in his earlier horizon (Gibson aspect). At present it seems probable that the Alto focus in east-central Texas was the earliest of the five, and therefore the most logical point of entry (in present knowledge) of the engraving technique into the eastern United States. 2 Webb and Dodd, 1941. 23 Krieger, 1945, p. 509. 24 Krieger, 1946. The spread of Caddoan peoples into eastern Louisiana and southeastern Arkansas from the Red River region was of very late date, as the studies of various individuals have amply testified. Likewise, these peoples spread west- ward into the plains of Texas and Oklahoma in very late prehistoric, or possibly in early his- toric, times. About the mouth of the Arkansas River the engraving technique occurs in the Alpika focus, a type site being that at Walls, Mississippi,25 and to the north in related sites such as Pecan Point26 and Bradley.27 Farther north, engraving was sometimes employed on the inner surface of plate rims in such late Middle Mississippi com- plexes as the Trappist and Spoon River foci. The most easterly extension of engraving as part of a ceramic complex is to be found in the Moundville focus. It is here suggested that this engraving had spread to the east and north from the "Caddo area." In the spring of 1946, Richard S. MacNeish of the University of Chicago made a survey of the eastern and northern portions of the state of Tamaulipas.28 Among other interesting results of his work was the identification of a ceramic complex from the Pueblito site which bears certain resemblances to "Caddoan" wares. Upon examining the Pueblito collections of MacNeish in Austin, Krieger was of the opinion that in paste, temper, color, polish, and general "feel" the closest resemblances lie rather definitely with Alto focus pottery in east-central Texas. The carinated bowl with flat base ap- pears in both areas. But on the whole the vessel forms are different. In design conception, con- sisting of simple straight-line motifs such as triangles and diagonals, to the exclusion of curvilinear motifs, Krieger believes that the Pueblito engraved pottery resembles that of Sanders focus much more than Alto. Sanders focus components lie farther north than Alto, principally in the Red River basin along the Texas-Oklahoma border, and it is thought that Sanders dates somewhat later than Alto al- though the two foci hold several traits in com- mon. Whether the closest analogies to Mac- Neish's Pueblito ware lie with Alto or Sanders, it is doubtlessly significant that any possible connection with the "Caddo area" is with the earlier of the two major horizons in the latter 26 Brown, 1926. 2 Moore, 1911, pp. 427-74. 27 Moore, 1905 and 1907. 28 Reported in the first article of this issue. Editor. 28 [1, 1947</page><page sequence="19">DU SOLIER, KRIEGER, AND GRIFIN] THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL ZONE OF BUENA VISTA territory. Furthermore, the Buena Vista pot- tery to be mentioned below is very distinct from, and probably later than, the Pueblito complex nearby in Mexico, and on the other hand compares very favorably with one of the pottery complexes in the later horizon (Fulton aspect) in Caddoan territory. Subsequent to the examination of Mac- Neish's collections, Wilfrido Du Solier allowed Griffin to examine the material obtained by him, in company with Gordon Ekholm, at the Buena Vista site, San Luis Potosi, in 1942. The Buena Vista pottery has as a strong element in its decorative complex incised and engraved rec- tilinear designs on a highly polished gray to black monochrome with pigment rubbed into the lines. This technique is of wide distribution in Middle American archaeological cultures, and of considerable temporal depth, but the specific Buena Vista type, called greyish-black by Du Solier, shows somewhat stronger re- semblance to the type Barkman Engraved in northeast Texas and southwest Arkansas than do any other known Mexican types. Two sherds included in greyish-black ware by Du Solier (PI. II, A, h, i), if found in the South- eastern United States, would likely be regarded as poor imitations of the lower Mississippi Valley type Coles Creek Incised. According to Krieger, however, the type Barkman Engraved includes variations, such as incised lines with subsequent polishing, which are difficult to dis- tinguish from engraved lines and are also oc- casionally remindful of Coles Creek Incised. After Griffin had sent Krieger some rather inadequate drawings of the greyish-black sherds from Mexico, he expressed his opinion that some of the sherds were surprisingly close to Barkman Engraved in decorative technique and pattern. At the First Symposium on the Cad- doan Archaeological Area, held in Norman, Oklahoma, September 12-14, 1946, Du Solier provided, characteristic sherds of the greyish- black ware, while others had brought type sherds from various complexes in the "Caddo area." We were then able to see and handle the sherds in question, and the three of us were in complete agreement that Barkman and greyish- black are so nearly alike that it would be hard to separate them if unlabeled. The type Bark- man Engraved is a common and characteristic part of the ceramic complex of Texarkana focus, which Krieger now believes dates from no later than 1400 or 1450 A.D. to about 1600 or 1650. Thus, if the greyish-black type at Buena Vista can be said to date approximately 1200 A.D., there is still a gap of perhaps 200 years between this and the Texarkana focus. Our dating methods are not so certain as yet, however, that the 200 years might not be resolved eventually. It must be pointed out that this length of time was probably not "taken up" by the gradual diffusion of Buena Vista ceramic elements northward as far as the northeast corner of Texas, for there is no known occurrence of comparable pottery between the two areas. If there was any direct connection between these two pottery complexes, it might best be ex- plained as a diffusion of concepts rather than a movement of people, for there are too many Mexican culture elements which do not appear in Texarkana focus. It is also of interest to note that the Buena Vista site had a few negative painted sherds which represent the most northeasterly occur- rence of this technique in Mexico. Negative painting is not a part of the Caddoan ceramic complex (although occasional trade pieces are known), but it is a fairly strong element in cer- tain portions of the eastern United States29 and its presence may best be explained as an impor- tation. Du Solier has referred to platform pipes in the general area of Buena Vista. These pipes are not of the Hopewell style but are of the type which has sometimes been called Caddoan with rather large ovoid to circular bases and a cen- trally placed cylindrical bowl. The presence of these pipes in the state of San Luis Potosi can be regarded as a possible north-to-south exchange on the basis of the known numerical predomi- nance of these pipes in the Caddoan area. There is a logical prototype in the Hopewellian plat- form pipe, and the center of dispersion of the "Caddoan" type would seem to be in the south- west central United States. The technique of incising and engraving with use of pigments to fill the lines occurs in the earliest ceramic horizons of central Mexico and Guatemala. It is particularly strong in the archaic cultures of the Valley of Mexico and a possible continuation of this concept may have survived in the Buena Vista area. Ekholm, Kelly, and others have shown that this decora- tive style was commonly employed in north- west Mexico at, roughly speaking, 1300 A.D.30 It may therefore be suggested that at a time 29 Willey and Phillips, 1944. 30 Ekholm, 1942, p. 130. 29</page><page sequence="20">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY conforming to the early stages of the Mixteca- Nahua horizon, the decorative technique of en- graving and incising on a polished monochrome pottery had become established from west to east across the northern margins of the Middle American province in Mexico, and had then been transferred to the "Caddo area." Here it became strongly established and finally came to be used with considerable skill over a large territory. We have said that such a transfer may have occurred during the early stages of the Mixteca- Nahua horizon, i.e., at about 1200-1300 A.D., but the date of the earliest appearance of this technique in the "Caddo area" is still uncertain. It was mentioned that Krieger regards the Alto focus as the earliest known complex with this technique in the eastern United States. At the Davis site in Cherokee County, east Texas, type site for Alto focus, Krieger believes there is some evidence of the contemporaneity of three distinct ceramic complexes. One of these is a sand tempered pottery bearing a resem- blance to the Alexander series of the Southeast. Another complex is represented by trade pot- tery of Marksville (southern Hopewellian) and/or Troyville types, and a third complex in- cludes highly polished brown and black bottles and bowls with very finely engraved lines filled with red pigment. The last-mentioned complex of engraved pottery is readily distinguished from the late prehistoric material in the same area. That the three complexes were contempo- raneous is possible, but it is probably too early to accept this as demonstrated until other sites clearly indicate such an association. If this interpretation is correct it would strengthen the hypothesis of an introduction of engraved pot- tery into Texas from Mexico at an earlier time than heretofore suspected. Since the Davis site includes a large pyramidal mound and village in which the three ceramic complexes occur, it may further be suggested that this is one of the earliest appearances (if not the earliest), of the pyramidal mound concept in the southern United States. In summary, there are reasons to believe that a technique of decorating polished pottery by engraving (cutting through the finished surface) or, occasionally, polishing over incised lines before firing, was introduced into the so-called "Caddo area" from Middle America. Subse- quently it became a general feature of the ceramic tradition throughout the "Caddo area" in four states, being applied to a great variety of vessel forms with many locally specialized trends. There are two culture horizons in this area, in both of which engraving is common to every focus, but there are such distinctions in vessel form and design pattern between the two horizons in general that anyone well acquainted with the material experiences little difficulty in recognizing them. At present, it seems possible that the Alto focus was the earliest culture in the eastern United States in which engraving was employed. If this is true, it is interesting to note that MacNeish's Pueblito culture of the Sierra de Tamaulipas bears engraved pottery which is similar in many respects to that of Alto focus, but also resembles that of Sanders focus in the same horizon in its simplicity of design. A second matter involves the very striking resemblances between the greyish-black en- graved-incised pottery of Buena Vista in San Luis Potosi, and the Barkman Engraved type of the Texarkana focus in extreme northeast Texas and southwest Arkansas. According to Du Solier the former probably belongs to the Tula- Mazapan horizon (900-1200 A.D.), while Krieger places the Texarkana focus at about 1400 or 1450 to 1600 or 1650 A.D. Both admit, however, that adjustments may be forthcoming in these dates and there may not actually have been any appreciable difference between these two cul- tures. Returning to the first matter, there is evi- dence that Pueblito was somewhat older than the Buena Vista culture on the one hand, and that the Alto and Sanders foci were older than Texarkana focus on the other. Thus is appears possible that a transfer of the engraving tech- nique from the northern reaches of Middle America into the "Caddo area" took place at least as early as Tula-Mazapan times, and per- haps earlier. Subsequently, another contact took place between these areas; expressed in the close similarity of greyish-black pottery and Barkman Engraved; this contact would seem to date toward the end of the Mazapan period or possibly in early Mixteca-Nahua times. 30 [1, 1947</page><page sequence="21">DU SOLIER, KRIEGER, AND GRIFFIN] THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL ZONE OF BUENA VISTA BIBLIOGRAPHY ACOSTA, JORGE R. 1940.
