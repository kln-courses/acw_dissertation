Does it follow a similar prosthetic conception? Nineteenth-century buildings, at least as exemplified by their iconic iron skeletons, may have been newly conceived in terms of disassembly and reassembly. They may even, according to Peters, have adopted the military's approach to the kinetics of machinery. If so, where does the 'mechanised' limb fit within such a coupling of machine and building? One possible answer is suggested by the fact that Viollet-le-Duc was the greatest nineteenth century proponent of a biological paradigm for architecture.

Viollet-le-Duc was of course not the only one to understand industrial products as coextensive with nature. The opening sentence of German engineer Franz Reuleaux's famous The Kinetics of Machinery of 1875 - the founding study for our modern way of thinking about mechanism - states it clearly: 'While in appearance a machine differs greatly from any of the force- or motion-distributors of nature, yet for the theoretical or pure mechanician no such difference exists ... so that to him the problems of machinery fall into the same class as those of the mechanical phenomena of nature.' See Franz Reuleaux, The Kinetics of Machinery: Outlines of a Theory of Machines (New York, ny: Dover Publications, 1963), p 29. Originally published in German in 1875 as Theoretische Kinematik: Grundziige einer Théorie des Maschinenwesens. A French edition was published in 1877 under the title Cinématique:principes fondamentaux d'une théorie générale des machines. The first English edition dates from 1876. Reuleaux of course never compared an animal's limbs to the organs of his machines. 12. See Georges Teyssot, op cit, pp 183-250. 13.

Madame Geneviève Viollet-le-Duc relayed to me personally the same opinion. 16. In the very last page of the novel Viollet-le-Duc himself writes that it is a 'histoire véridique'; see Histoire d'un dessinateur, op cit, p 302. For my analysis £.a*UMMT. mdcccixiv: Eugène Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc, 46m-span polyhedral vaulted hall, Entretiens sur l'architecture, vol il, 1872 of the autobiographical character of The Story of a Young Designer, see Architecture and the Historical Imagination, op cit, pp 499-525. 17. In fact Viollet-le-Duc only specifies that Jean manufactured, using machine production, 'iron and wood furniture that join elegance to great solidity' and that these were of 'novel and original' designs; see Histoire d'un dessinateur, op cit, p 298. But knowing the type of movable and adaptable furniture in iron and wood that he had built for himself, I speculate that Viollet-le-Duc may have had that sort of design in mind. 18.
