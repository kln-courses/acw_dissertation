In 1964, Alexander Marshak published a two-page article, the title of which was tantamount to a "revolution" in prehistoric archae- ology: "Lunar Notation on Upper Paleolithic Remains" (Scientia 146: 743-45). A number of more elaborate studies brought out in rapid sequence in 1970 and 1971 corroborated the opinion that, to quote Professor Hallam Movins, we are confronted with "a major breakthrough in the field of the interpretation and understanding of Upper Paleo- lithic art." Among these contributions, the most important are Marshak's communication to the Valcamonica symposium on pre- historic art, "New Techniques in the Analysis and Interpretation of Mesolithic Notations and Symbolic Art" (cf. Actes du symposium international, ed. Emmanuel Anati [1970], pp. 479-94) and his mono- graph Notation dans les gravures du paleolithique supe'rieur: Nouvelles methodes d'analyse (Bordeaux: Institut de prehistoire de l'Universite de Bordeaux, Memoire no. 8, 1970). While continuing to elucidate and defend his discoveries in scientific journals (cf. "Cognitive Aspects of Upper Paleolithic Engraving," Current Anthropology 13, nos. 3-4 [June-October 1972]: 445-77; 140</page><page sequence="2">History of Religions "Upper Paleolithic Notation and Symbol," Science 178 [November 1972]: 817-28), Marshak thought that the time has come to address himself to a larger audience. Thus, he has brought out this sumptuous book, abundantly and splendidly illustrated, which reads like a thrilling, humorous, and challenging recit d'aventures. The first chapters narrate the vicissitudes of tracking the almost invisible signs engraved on stones and bones from Upper Paleolithic levels in Europe (pp. 9-55). In order to collect and examine these mysterious notations, Marshak applied a new technique, namely, microscopic analysis of the data. After seven years of research in sixty-five European collections situated in nine countries, he has come to the conclusion that the notches and marks engraved on different artifacts, which can be clearly recognized through the microscope, constitute certain semantic "patterns"; specifically, that they represent observational lunar notations. What is even more significant is that such notations are found from the period of the Aurignacian (ca. 32,000 years ago) to the terminal Magdalenian (ca. 10,000 years ago), in all Upper Paleolithic cultures "from the Russian steppe and tundra westward to the Atlantic and south to the foothills of the Pyrenees, over the mountains and along the warm seacoasts of Spain and Italy" (p. 109). In sum, it looks as if the Paleolithic engraving was a continent-wide "system" of time notations based on lunar periodicities. Marshak interprets this "system" as illustrating what he calls the "time- factored thought." The structure of the engravings suggests that a number of seasonal and other periodic ceremonies and rites were "scheduled" long ahead in the year, as is the case in the Siberian and North American Indian traditions (cf. Science [1972], p. 827). Thus, to quote from Marshak's own evaluation of his discoveries, "the evidence for a ubiquitous tradition of Upper Paleolithic notation would seem to verify a modern level of cognitive capacity and symbolic usage in early, prewriting, prearithmetic phases of sapiens culture. The complexity of the tradition in the typical Aurignacian implies an earlier origin. The later complexities of the tradition in the terminal Magdalenian may indicate that formal writing, arithmetic, and the true calendar, which appear in the first agricultural civilizations, may have had reference to this earlier symbolizing tradition, one that was at least 25,000 years old" (Current Anthropology [1972], p. 461). Such conclusions 1 brilliantly vindicate those scholars-from Wilhelm Schmidt and Olivier Leroy to Karl Narr and Claude Levi-Strauss-who were convinced neither by the "prelogical" structure of the mentalite primitive nor by the supposed Urdummheit of archaic man. In three important chapters (11-13: "Image of the World: Time- 1 It is interesting to note that, of the eighteen archaeologists who commented upon Marshak's article in Current Anthropology, only two indicated that they are not entirely convinced by his argument. 141</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews factored Art," "Time-factored Death," and "Sex and the Goddess," pp. 169-340), Marshak tests his method on a number of Paleolithic artifacts and rock-engravings, most of them familiar to the reader. The section on "Sex and the Goddess" is particularly interesting for the historian of religions. In the preceding chapters, the author argues that the signs and figures of the Upper Paleolithic represent "stories" (or myths). Thus, they are highly significant, for, though we do not know the specific "stories" depicted, the process is understandable. Indeed, "every process recognized and used in human culture becomes a story, and every story is an event which includes characters (whether spirit, god, hero, person, .. .) who change or do things in time. Without knowing the story, we can assume that the reality of sexual maturation, function, and interrelation, male and female, was storied. Since every story can potentially end in a number of ways, efforts would be made to participate in the story, and therefore, to change or influence the story or process or to become meaningfully a part of it. When such acts become traditional, we can sometimes call them 'magic' or 'religious"' (p. 283). Of course, we cannot "read" or interpret an image or a sign from the Upper Paleolithic as we can now read the figurative or nonfigurative elements of a hieroglyphic or alphabetic system. "For the meanings are maintained by myth and story and by their working, ritual relation to each other, as much as by definition or translation" (p. 324). Thus, the meanings of a naked female are time factored, that is, depend on the mythological and ritual contexts, and also on the local traditions (p. 326). Moreover, not all the feminine figures have the same significance. Marshak repeatedly points out the differences between "real' woman and goddess (cf. p. 322). What seems certain, though, is the fact that it is not the anatomic "sexual" organ that is symbolized, but the stories, characters, and processes with which the symbol had become associated (p. 297). The sign of the vulva, that is, the myths in which it was involved, implies also a relation with the "male" (= masculine stories) and with death. One finds vulva symbols used in relation to animals and plants (p. 319), but the same is true of the phallic symbols associated with animals, and most probably to animal myths (p. 330). In the last analysis, the "erotic" content seems always "transmuted" through symbolic processes. Within the symbolic area of the feminine, Marshak finds comple- mentary masculine images, "using the same equation of story and tradition, of symbolism and composition" (p. 330). Moreover, there are abundant indications of "a separate and specialized masculine imagery and mythology, in part perhaps specialized with the male shaman but also belonging to the group" (p. 339). For this reason, the author does not accept the theories of a Paleolithic "matriarchy" or of the totemistic idea of a "clan mother" that have been elaborated by Soviet archaeologists (pp. 338-39). 142</page><page sequence="4">History of Religions Marshak also explores two important problems which I also hope to discuss in the near future. "The first is the attitude of reverence and prayer which seems to be concurrent with expressions of ceremony and rite, and perhaps sacrifice and killing; the second is the depiction of pregnancy, which seems in some cases to be related to the reverence and to symbolic killing or sacrifice" (p. 325). He devotes the last chapter ("The Step toward History," pp. 345-64) to an analysis of some Mesolithic symbolism. (As a matter of fact, throughout the book, he frequently points out the possible relations of the Upper Paleolithic cultures with the Neolithic; cf., inter alia, p. 335.) The Roots of Civilization is certainly a most challenging and rewarding book. Marshak has succeeded in disclosing a new dimension of Homo sapiens' mode of being in the world. 2. After ten years of active participation in the archaeological exploration of Harran (Syria) and the tell of Byblos (cf., inter alia, his important monograph Les outillages neolithiques de Byblos et du littoral libanais [Paris, 1969]), Jacques Cauvin presents a concise analysis of the Neolithic religions of Syria and Palestine. A great number of clearly reproduced sketches of figurines and frescoes enhance the documentary value of the book. In an introductory chapter (pp. 7-17), the author dicusses the methodological problems of identifying the religious meanings of prehistoric documents. The second chapter (pp. 19-31) is devoted to the interpretation of Natufian religion, based especially on the sepultures and the figurines brought to light by the most recent excavations. In the third chapter (pp. 33-41), Cauvin examines the first preceramic "Neolithic" of Palestine, that is, the figurines of El Khiam and Nahal Oren, the problem of animal sacrifices at El Khiam, and the funeral rites of Jericho. The religion of the second preceramic Neolithic constitutes the topic of chapter 4 (pp. 43-66), and here the archaeological materials become considerably richer and more complex. It suffices to recall some of the most important religious documents brought to light at Jericho: the sanctuaries, the plastered skulls, the clay statues. The author reacts against the exaggerated importance bestowed upon the plastered skulls after their discovery by Miss Kenyon: "cette notoriete repose sur un petit nombre de documents spectaculaires reproduits partout, mais notre connaissance des coutumes correspondantes reste vague sur bien des points" (p. 45). He also rejects Garstang's hypothesis of a "divine triad" (p. 51), which was based on the three heads of plaster figures and which has since been generally accepted by scholars (cf., for instance, Emmanuel Anati, Palestine before the Hebrews [New York, 1963], p. 256; and R. de Vaux, Histoire ancienne d'Israel, vol. 1, [Paris, 1971], p. 42: "premiere apparition de la triade divine qui aura une si longue destinee dans les cultes du Proche-Orient"). After Jericho, Cauvin analyzes the figurines and funerary rites of Munhata and Beidha (sites excavated recently by J. Perrot and D. Kirkbride). There follows 143</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews a short, but important, presentation of the documents of Tell Ramad, situated in Syria near Damascus, which was explored by H. de Con- tenson and W. Y. Van Liere (pp. 58-60). Here, a number of limestone anthropomorphic figurines and plastered skulls were discovered. According to Cauvin, the plastered skulls confirm the opinion that such deposits are distinct "des sepultures proprement dites et ont bien leur place a l'interieur des habitats" (p. 60). Although each of these four chapters contains a conclusion in which the author examines the documents analyzed within a larger perspec- tive,2 he devotes the fifth chapter to a general and comparative study of the Syro-Palestinian religion in the fourth and fifth millennia (pp. 67-105). His discussion of the Palestinian statuettes representing the "Mere Terrible" (pp. 86 ff.) is followed by a comparative analysis of funerary rituals (burials in fetal position, the "Maison des Morts" at Byblos, and the unique example of a collective burial at that site, pp. 94 ff.). His conclusions can be summarized as follows: probably as a result of the direct contacts between Syro-Palestine and Anatolia (Catal Hiiyiik), the Goddess rises to primacy; she is represented seated, though not always on a throne, as is the famous Goddess from Catal Hiiyiik): "Toute une posterite de divinites tronantes sortira de cette image prehistorique" (p. 98). The author relates this seated position of the Goddess to the fact that "l'humanite 's'installe"' (p. 98), that is, "sedentarization." But there subsist a number of stylistic differences: for instance, while the eyes are not emphasized in the art of Hacilar and Catal Hiiyiik, they play an important role in that of Mesopotamia and Neolithic Iran. Such emphasis probably explains the "terrific" aspect of the clay goddesses of Munhata (p. 102). Melaart discovered statues of a masculine deity in sixth-millennium Anatolia. With the exception of an enigmatic painted figurine from Byblos (fig. 28, no. 2), nothing comparable has come to light in Syria and Palestine. With regard to funerary belief, the only innovation could be the idea of a subterranean localization of the dead during the postceramic Neolithic (pp. 104 ff). In the middle Neolithic, three different types of postmortem treatment can be distinguished: the simple burial, collective sepulture, and the skull deposits (p. 105). A short chapter of conclusions (pp. 107-12) retraces the "religious evolution from the IX to VI millenium." The predominance of therio- morphic figurations among the hunters of the ninth millennium is well established, thus relating the Syro-Palestinian sequence to the tradition of the Western Paleolithic. There is a concomitance between the progress of sedentarization and the growing frequency of anthropo- morphic representation of the divinity. (One is curious to know how 2 For instance, in chap. 4 (pp. 62 ff.), while discussing the skull cult, he mentions the famous frescoes from Catal Hiiyiik and accepts F. Hours's conclusion that "le culte des ancetres est la caracteristique la plus evidente et la plus nouvelle de la religion du septieme millenaire." 144</page><page sequence="6">History of Religions the author explains the great number of anthropomorphic figures during the Paleolithic.) For Cauvin, the important factor-social as well as religious-is not agriculture as a means of food production, but the process of sedentarization, of which the most illustrious example is the Jericho tower, which was built in preagricultural times and which presupposes a sedentary and well-structured society (p. 107). Concerning the pre- dominance of anthropomorphic figurations of divinity, the author notices a predominance of the Goddess represented in a seated position. But this predominance seems rather late. "Ce n'est qu'au septieme millenaire &amp; Jericho et a Ras Shamra que le mythogramme d'une deesse encore schematique mais reposant deja sur une base tres elargie commence a surgir, pour occuper par la suite le devant de la scene" (p. 110). There is certainly a historical relation to the development of agriculture, but this does not necessarily mean that the Goddess was an agricultural deity. (No agricultural symbolism appears in Syro- Palestine before the fourth millennium, and when it does appear, it is present only in the funerary sphere; p. 110, n. 2.) Last, the author emphasizes the minor role played by the "God." According to him, the Son-Husband is a late figure; Catal Hiiyiik has certainly proved that he is more ancient than was thought, but never- theless, the "God" appears in Anatolia only in the sixth millennium. The enigmatic masculine figures of Jericho and elsewhere could thus be taken to represent not "gods" but "ancestors" (p. 112). This book was probably in the press when Wolfgang Helck published his Betrachtungen zur grossen Gottin und den ihr verbundenen Gottheiten (Munich and Vienna, 1971), in which the Great Goddess is discussed from her Paleolithic antecedents down to the first millennium B.C. But one regrets that Cauvin ignored the second volume of H. Miiller-Karpe, Handbuch der Vorgeschichte, volume 2, Jungsteinzeit (Munich, 1968). He could considerably broaden his "comparative horizon." Also, he did not make use of P. J. Ucko's monograph Anthropomorphic Figurines (London, 1968), but quotes only Ucko's preliminary article published in JRAI, 1962. The reader of Marshak's book will also query some of Cauvin's interpretations (e.g., the "religious devaluation" of the mascu- line figures). But one must be grateful to the author that he does not proclaim the Syro-Palestinian complex as a model for other Neolithic religions. It suffices to read Marija Gimbutas's article on "The Earliest European Civilization" (Journal of Indo-European Studies 1 [Spring 1973]: 1-20) in order to notice not only the differences between the Near Eastern civilizations (Anatolian, Levantine, and Mesopotamian) and the "Old European Civilization" but also their simultaneous appearance at approximately 7000 B.C. or before. Masks of divinities, human and animal, clay figurines, theriomorphic vases, and other cult objects were found in great quantities in the Balkan and Danubian areas from a period before and after 6000 B.C. (Gimbutas, pp. 5 ff.). 145</page><page sequence="7">Book Reviews 3. Since 1953, the year when it was first published, Professor Rudenko's Kultura naseliniya gornogo altaya v skifstoe vremya has been a celebrated book, even for those who do not read Russian. It has been widely reviewed and abundantly summarized in virtually every monograph on the ancient Altaians. The main reason for such popularity is, of course, the tremendous wealth of archaeological material dis- covered in the frozen burrows (kurgan) of Pazyryk. The first two kurgans were opened by Radloff in 1865 but with rudimentary means; rigorous exploration began with Gryaznov (1925-29) and Rudenko (1927-29, 1947-49). The objects recovered from these permanently frozen tombs are of an amazing variety: sacrificial horses, embalmed bodies of men and women with their clothing and personal adornments (belts, mirrors, beads, earrings, etc.) weapons, musical instruments, and especially a great number of superbly painted or decorated objects (saddles and bridles, carpets, felt wall hangings, sculptured figures, carved wooden deer with attached leather antlers, wooden cutouts in the form of human heads, etc.). Thus, a nomadic society, long since disappeared, came to life. In spite of the fact that most of the tombs have been ransacked, the contents of the kurgans also throw some light on the civilizations with whom the Altaians were in contact. To give only one example, the Iranian and Chinese textiles recovered at Pazyryk are older than any surviving samples from Persia or China. Most of the kurgans date from the beginning of the fifth century B.C. (As yet, only a few radiocarbon analyses are available.) The Chinese imported objects (embroidery, silk, and mirrors) are probably from the fifth century B.C., the same epoch as the Achaemenid carpets and pieces of damask. Unfortunately, the chapter devoted to "Religious Beliefs and Rituals" is too brief (pp. 279-91). The embalmment of the corpses, practiced in Assyria, Media, and Persia, was also used among the Black Sea Scythians in the middle of the first millennium B.C. We know now that the same custom reached as far northeast as the Altai (p. 282). But the religious meaning of this type of mummification is still obscure. Rudenko rightly compares the objects deposited in the tombs (weapons, horses and saddles, a concubine, etc.) with the information given by Herodotus about the Scythians. Most probably, the Scythian purification rituals after funerals (Herodotus, 4. 73-75) were likewise practiced at Pazyryk, where a bronze caldron for the burning of hemp and hemp seeds was unearthed. Rudenko also cites the commemoration of the dead practiced once a year by the Issedones (ibid., 4. 26) and, according to Chinese sources, by the Huns and other tribes living to the east of the High Altai (pp. 285 ff.). One of the most remarkable documents is the scene figured on a great felt carpet of a rider before a goddess seated on a throne (pl. 154). Taking into consideration the Scythian pantheon described by Herodotus (4. 57), the author concludes that the goddess may correspond to Tabiti (= Hestia) or Apsa (= Hera); but Jettmar is probably 146</page><page sequence="8">History of Religions correct in comparing her to Anahita. We do not know anything with regard to Altaian rituals. Rudenko, however, quotes the sacrificial offerings of the Scythians and other pastoralists of Central Asia and surmises that similar religious beliefs were shared by the Altaians (p. 290). He rightly rejects Marr's hypothesis of "totemism," which is supported neither by the Greek nor the Chinese sources (p. 289). He does admit, with the majority of scholars, that the famous iconographic motif of carnivores attacking herbivores has a Near Eastern origin, but he does not discuss its mythological symbolism. In an article published in 1931, Rudenko interpreted the headdress of one of the horses as a mask of a reindeer's head, thus assuming the survival of an archaic religious conception specifically related to the rein- deer hunters and breeders. This interpretation was generally accepted (and is still considered correct by many, e.g., Mario Bussagli, Culture e civilita dell'Asia Centrale [Turin, 1970], p. 89). Rudenko, however, now recognizes and rectifies his error: "Of the eight head-crests found, only in one is there a deer's head and in a second antlers; all the rest made use of different motifs. So there could be no question of the general dressing up of horses as deer" (p. 185). But Rudenko does not discuss the religious meaning of such "masks" attached to the sacrificial horses. (As a matter of fact, this custom still awaits a satisfactory explanation.) Considering himself exclusively an archaeologist, Rudenko does not feel compelled to exhaust the analysis of the religious documents brought to light at Pazyryk. Thus, he does not comment on some scenes with evident religious significance, for instance, the splendid cloth decorated with women standing in front of a censer in an attitude of prayer (p. 291, fig. 139). But, then, why does he risk such interpretations as the following one: "The presence of hair and nails in the tomb constitutes definite evidence of animism" (p. 287)? One must, however, be grateful to Professor M. W. Thompson and to the University of California Press for making accessible to non- Russian readers this important and well-illustrated book.
