While explanations for this distribution have traditionally focused on medical or psychological phenomena, it is my contention that anorexia nervosa can only be understood in a sociocultural context. It is suggested that the following conditions are necessary for the disorder to occur: (1) individuals must be biologically predisposed; (2) they must be exposed to cultural pressures for slimness; (3) they must lack meaningful peer attachments; and (4) they must be embedded in a social structure regulated by universalism and achievement. The position taken here is that the co-occurrence of these variables is a relatively recent historical development and may account for the disorder's apparent increase during the past 15 to 20 years. xm.norexia nervosa is a complex disorder in which emotional, physiological, and interpersonal processes are altered. It is characterized by an overwhelming fear of fatness, voluntary restriction of food intake, massive denial of hunger, hyperactivity without fatigue, extreme body image distortion, and the misperception of internal body sensations. In addition to food refusal, anorexics frequently resort to self-induced vomiting, and abuse laxatives and enemas in an effort to achieve weight control. With severe weight loss, bodily functioning is disrupted. Such pathophysiological disturbances as emaciation, amenorrhea, bradycardia, lanugo, and hypothermia are not uncommon; between five and 15 percent of those with the disorder die (Kay and Leigh, 1954; Wilhams, 1958; Theander, 1970; Crisp et al, 1977). Various studies have indicated that anorexia nervosa occurs disproportionately among women. While estimates of the male to female ratio vary, it is thought to occur 10 to 20 times more frequently in women than men (Rowland, 1970; Bruch, 1971; Crisp and Toms, 1972; Duddle, 1973; Kendell et al, 1973; Hasan and Tibbets, 1977), with adolescents and young women particularly vulnerable (Kay and Leigh, 1954; Williams, 1958; Theander, 1970; Crisp and Stonehill, 1971; Crisp et al., 1976). The disorder</page><page sequence="2">234 SOCIOLOGICAL FOCUS usually appears in middle and upper class females (Warren, 1968; Russell, 1972; Bruch, 1973; Morgan and Russell, 1975; Crisp et al., 1976; Kalucy et al., 1977). It is rarely found among nonwhites. This descriptive material comes from clinical observations and epidemiological researches. Most of these studies invariably underestimate and distort the true incidence of any disorder, since they include only those patients who enter the formal health care system. Entry into care is in turn mediated by such variables as the visibility of the disorder, the availability and accessibility of treatment resources, individual and community attitudes toward psychiatric care, the tolerance level of those exposed to the disorder, and differential diagnosis (Mechanic, 1980). These limitations, however, may apply less to anorexia nervosa than to disorders with more ambiguous symptomatology. Anorexics, especially those in the advanced stages of the disorder, can be identified by such distinctive physiological stigmata as severe emaciation, lanugo, and amenorrhea. These signs are observable to others and are sufficiently disturbing to ensure that most grossly underweight individuals will eventually enter the medical and/or psychiatric health care system. Furthermore, as scientific interest in the disorder has increased, it is likely that the syndrome of anorexia nervosa has become considerably more familiar and well delineated, so that diagnostic criteria are now fairly uniform from place to place. For these reasons it will be assumed that clinical observations and epidemiological studies describe the social world with some degree of accuracy, and that the question to be explained ? why anorexia nervosa is almost exclusively confined to relatively affluent young White females ? is not an artifact of the unrepresentativeness of the patient populations studied. While traditional explanations for this distribution have focused on medical or psychological phenomena, it is my contention that the disorder can only be understood in a socioculturel context. It is suggested that the following conditions are necessary for anorexia nervosa to occur: (1) individuals must be biologically vulnerable; (2) they must be exposed to a cultural emphasis on slimness; (3) they must lack meaningful peer attachments; and (4) they must be embedded in a social structure regulated by universalism and achievement. The differential distribution of these conditions may account for the variation in the incidence of anorexia nervosa cross-culturally as well as among the various population subgroups within particular societies. The position taken here is that the specific configuration of variables necessary for the widespread occurrence of the disorder is a relatively recent historical development and is inextricably related to the advent of the industrial age. It is therefore hypothesized that the incidence of anorexia nervosa will be highest among those countries characterized by a high degree of modernization, and within those countries among those segments of the population most integrated into the mainstream of modern life. The purpose of this paper is to show how this configuration is related to the high incidence of anorexia nervosa among young, middle and upper class White females.</page><page sequence="3">ANOREXIA NERVOSA 235 BIOLOGICAL VULNERABILITY At the most general level, females may be at greater risk for anorexia nervosa than males because they are biologically vulnerable. Studies on the appetite fluctuations of normal people have revealed that under stress, women are four times more likely than males to exhibit both hypophagic and hyperphagic reactions, while males are three times less likely to experience any change in appetite (Krumbacher and Meyer, cited in Myer, 1971). Thus, given the same amount of stress, females are more likely than males to respond by decreasing their consumption of food. CULTURAL EMPHASIS ON SLIMNESS Whether self-starvation or overeating will be the adaptation of choice may depend upon the cultural values to which the individual is exposed. In modern industrial societies, the biological predisposition to undereat during periods of stress is likely reinforced by the tremendous cultural pressure for slimness in females and by the social acceptability of exercise, dieting, and weight loss. An abundance of food seems to be necessary for the articulation of these values, and consequently they are of marginal significance among the lower classes and are absent in cultures characterized by chronic food shortages (Stunkard, 1975). Such values, however, appear to be immensely influential among middle and upper class females in Western urban settings. "This inference is supported by the finding that women in the United States have become somewhat thinner during the last 20 years of mounting concern over obesity, while men have continued to become fatter' ' (Stunkard, 1975: 204). Other studies indicate that these values also appear to have a considerable impact on female children (Stunkard et al., 1972) and adolescents (Huenemann et al., 1966). For example, Heunemann et al. questioned one entire grade of the public high school system in Berkeley, California (1,000 students) concerning body image, preferred means of adjusting weight, and outcome of weight reduction efforts. Their investigation revealed sharp divergences between males and females. More than 40 percent of the females studied considered themselves to be overweight. Anthropomorphic measures, however, confirmed this perception in only 25 percent of the cases. Nonetheless, 65 percent of the ninth grade and 55 percent of the 12th grade girls indicated they were trying to do something about their weight. The preferred means for accomplishing this was dietary manipulation. Males were no more satisfied with their bodies than were females. However, then concerns were just the reverse, being too thin or being underweight. These perceptions were just as unrealistic as those expressed by females, since only 25 percent were objectively measured as being below average in fatness. Nevertheless, the majority of males were engaged in efforts to increase body weight, size, and strength. Although males as well as females preferred altering their dietary habits to control weight, males were more likely than females to mention exercise as a means of changing their physical appearance. A similar investigation by Nylander (1971) again documents the pervasiveness of body image distortion and dieting behavior among students. This comprehensive</page><page sequence="4">236 SOCIOLOGICAL FOCUS study involved nearly all students aged 14 and older (N = 2370) in the Swedish town of Umea The students were heterogeneous with regard to type of school attended and included those from primary schools, the gymnasium, and trade schools. Height and weight data were obtained from questionnaires and from the medical records of every fourth student. Ninety-seven percent of the population were of normal weight for height. In spite of the group's apparent leanness, over half the girls studied had at some time felt that they were fat and about one-third had dieted. With advancing age, more girls reported feeling fat, dieting, and greater weight loss. Nylander found that the majority of his dieters were at least moderately successful in their attempts at weight reduction. In fact, 25 percent (N = 107) of the dieting females (N = 428) developed at least three adverse physiological and/or psychological side effects in connection with their loss of weight. Fifteen of the 107 girls reported losing 22 pounds or more, and eight had been diagnosed as anorexics by the Child Psychiatric Clinic. In contrast, males infrequently felt fat and seldom dieted. These findings suggest that among a normal population of teenage girls, one in 10 is likely to have experienced several anorexia-like symptoms, and that approximately one dieter in 50 will unequivocally have had the disorder. These findings illustrate the enormous impact cultural pressures for slimness have on adolescent females. Even those of normal weight for height regard themselves as overweight and voluntarily restrict their consumption of food. By contrast, these pressures have a negligible impact on males, whose chief concern is increasing their body mass. Because "cosmetic" dieting (Fries, 1974) has been regarded as a precursor or precipitant of anorexia nervosa, these studies suggest that in a normal population of teenagers, there is a fairly large pool of females whose body image distortions and dieting behaviors place them at risk for the disorder. Thus, biological predisposition and cultural pressures can be seen to interact in such a way so as to increase female susceptibility to anorexia nervosa relative to males. While a cultural milieu that emphasizes slimness and encourages dieting behavior shapes the expression of psychological distress, neither these preoccupations nor biological vulnerabilities are by themselves sufficient to provoke anorexia nervosa. Many adolescent females reduce their caloric intake with no untoward consequences. What also seems necessary to transform cosmetic dieting to uncontrolled weight loss is the lack of an adequate personal network. ABSENCE OF PEER ATTACHMENTS Although all social networks consist of direct and indirect connections among a set of individuals, they vary in terms of size, density, symmetry, boundedness, and degree of interconnectedness. These variables have been found to be highly predictive of such diverse phenomena as the content of conjugal roles (Bott, 1957), community organization (Granovetter, 1973), the adoption of a medical innovation (Coleman et al., 1966), changes in schizophrenic symptomatology (Wing, 1978), and the rates of hospital readrnission (Cohen and Sokolovsky, 1978). Thus, it is not unreasonable to assume that network variables may also play an important role in the development of</page><page sequence="5">ANOREXIA NERVOSA 237 anorexia nervosa. Research on normal individuals has shown a considerable degree of uniformity in the size and structure of personal networks (Hammer et al., 1978). They generally consist of six to 10 close friends, most of whom are also mutually acquainted and another 30 or so individuals who are in regular contact with the focal individual. By contrast, the social networks of anorexics are constricted to the point of being nonexistent (Palazzoli, 1974; Bruch, 1978). They are either totally isolated from extrafamilial peer relationships or have no more than one friend at a time. Furthermore, these friendships are shortlived, usually lasting no more than a year. The poverty of the anorexic's social network is perpetuated by the high turnover in personal ties. Since the formation of an effective network is a time consuming process, friendships that are relatively brief preclude the establishment of a highly interconnected network of close relationships. The anorexic's failure to establish meaningful peer attachments can be attributed in large measure to the values and transactional style of her family. Minuchin et al. (1978) have described four characteristics of family functioning which conjoin to precipitate the child's psychosomatic symptoms. These are enmeshment, overprotectiveness, rigidity, and lack of conflict resolution. The first two characteristics tend to isolate the family from external contact. They define enmeshment as referring "to an extreme form of proximity and intensity in family interactions" and overprotectiveness as a "high degree of concern of family members for each other's welfare." McCall and Simmons (1966) have suggested that all groups violate the integrity of individuals because they limit self-expression. Groups vary in the aspects of personality that are encouraged or restricted, and individuals must monitor their behavior to fit the particular expectations of each group in which they participate. Thus, to some extent, a violation of individual integrity is an inescapable consequence of social interaction. However, in the families of anorexics the suppression of individuality is extreme. Enmeshed families place a high value on togetherness. Privacy is taboo. Family members are overly involved with one another even to the extent of intruding on each other's thoughts and feelings (Minuchin et al., 1978). This excessive involvement precludes peer interaction and retards the development of age appropriate interactional skills. One adolescent female was convinced that her relationship with her parents was so special that they would not want her to have outside interests (Bruch, 1978). Such families are very inwardly focused and tend to discourage outside relationships. Friends are criticized for being too selfish, vulgar, frivolous, or inferior. In one case, the mother insinuated that her adolescent daughter and best friend were involved in a homosexual relationship. In another instance, the father of two anorexic daughters stated that "We did not want them to play with kids in the neighborhood because they would be subject to bad influences and learn bad things" (Minuchin et al, 1978: 62). This enmeshment produces an inordinate amount of mutual surveillance and heightens the awareness of each individual to signs of distress. Tension or conflict are rarely confronted directly. Instead, interpersonal stresses and antagonisms elicit</page><page sequence="6">238 SOCIOLOGICAL FOCUS protective and nurturing responses which gloss over the underlying discord. The exaggerated concern for each other's welfare can be seen in the following vignette: SIMON: Do you have a Kleenex? FATHER: Use my handkerchief. Here. It's a clean handkerchief. Spread it apart. THERAPIST: He's seventeen. FATHER: But I'm going to have to use the handkerchief. MOTHER (passing a tissue to father): Let him keep that one. FATHER: All right. THERAPIST: My goodness! Look how this family gets activated. Son wanted a handkerchief. So Father gave him his, Mother gave a kleenex to Father, Daughter offered her handkerchief (Minuchin et al., 1978: 68) Such overprotectiveness tends to retard the development of a personal network by encouraging withdrawal from a world that is perceived as uncertain, dangerous, and frequently painful (Kalucy et al, 1977). Moreover, by discouraging risk-taking, change, perseverance, or other sources of potential psychic pain, such families inhibit the development of competence, mastery, and self confidence. As a consequence, the external world appears unduly threatening and the individual retreats even further into the safety of the family. A number of studies have shown that anorexics whose weight has been returned to normal are submissive, self-effacing, display high levels of social anxiety, and prefer to avoid social situations (Stonehill and Crisp, 1977; Pillay and Crisp, 1977). So far, three factors necessary for the development of anorexia nervosa have been isolated: a biological predisposition, cultural pressures for slimness, and social isolation. However, these are still insufficient to precipitate the disorder. They become important etiologically only in the context of a society regulated by the criteria of universalism and achievement. This is because isolation from age mates is dysfunctional in societies which are heavily dependent on peer attachments to integrate the adolescent into the wider society. UNIVERSALISM AND ACHIEVEMENT The integrative functions performed by adolescent peer groups are essential because in modern universalistic societies, there is a disjunction between the family and the external world in the rules and values under which each sphere functions (Benedict, 1938; Eisenstadt, 1956). According to Eisenstadt, family relationships in all societies are characterized by the criteria of ascription, particularism, and expressivity. That is, behavior toward others is determined by relationships or personal qualities, and solidarity and emotional security are valued over instrumental activities. By contrast, the main integrative principles of modern social structures emphasize universalism, achievement, and specificity. These criteria tend to produce an environment in which competition, rationality, and impersonality are emphasized at the expense of emotional gratification. This discontinuity presents problems for the integration of individuals into the wider society. On the one hand, they must discard the patterns of behavior acquired with the family since they are no longer functional, and on the other, adopt modes of conduct more appropriate to the external world. Because these behaviors and modes of</page><page sequence="7">ANOREXIA NERVOSA 239 orientation are not immediately self evident, there is a lag between the abandonment of old behaviors and the discovery of new ones. This hiatus is characterized by a high degree of uncertainty, since individuals are without a well-defined normative structure to guide their behavior. In such a situation, there is a marked decline in autonomy and a concomitant increase in the formation of personal dependencies. In modern societies this transition from the private to the public sphere is the major developmental task of adolescence. During this period, adolescents are expected to begin the process of detaching themselves from their family of orientation so that they can assume full membership within the social system. As they leave the security of the family, adolescents encounter expectations for behavior that are considerably at odds with those learned within the family. They face increased pressures for independence and achievement, increased competitiveness, and an increase in relationships governed by instrumental criteria. Since past experience is an unreliable guide to behavior, adolescents are plagued by uncertainty as to how to respond and deal with these pressures. This situation generates considerable anxiety and psychological tension. While these pressures are felt equally by both sexes, it is suggested that this transition has become much more stressful for females. In the past 15 to 20 years, women have made tremendous gains in personal freedom. To some extent the Civil Rights and Women's Movements have opened up the more prestigious male dominated occupations. Working women have achieved increased social acceptance, and divorce, abortion, and childlessness have lost much of their stigma. These social changes have heightened the stressfulness of adolescence. Previously, a woman's Ufe was largely predetermined. She married soon after high school and began raising a family of her own. There were few other acceptable roles. Since this was primarily a shift from one private sphere to another, the female could easily transfer the integrative principles learned within her family of orientation to her family of procreation, thereby lessening the trauma of adolescence. Today, however, women are free to choose from among a bewildering array of Ufe styles and career opportunities, and many are choosing to participate in the various social institutions. As a result, adolescence has become increasingly stressful for the growing numbers of females who face the unsettling task of acquiring the behavior patterns that will allow them to attain full membership status in the public domain. Added to these pressures is the stress of biological development, which is likely to be felt more keenly by females than by males. Not only do they reach puberty significantly earlier (BUzzard et al., 1970), but they also experience an alteration in the basic configuration of the body. Females lose their slim, angular lines with the development of the secondary sex characteristics, whereas males retain the general shape of their bodies. Because these changes produce such a radical alteration in appearance, females, unlike males, are forced to deal with a biological discontinuity at the same time that they must cope with a major social transition. As the above discussion indicates, the transition from the family to the occupational sphere is especially difficult for adolescents in modern societies. Weber (1947) has suggested that, in the absence of unambiguous and reliable normative expectations, the capacity for autonomous behavior is diminished and there is a</page><page sequence="8">240 SOCIOLOGICAL FOCUS concomitant increase in the formation of mutual dependencies, as individuals turn to each other for direction and support. This view is also shared by Eisenstadt, who observed that at those points of structural discontinuity, where the roles and values governing behavior shift radically, individuals develop a need to interact with others in order to ease the transition into unfamiliar institutional spheres. He notes that relationships with age-mates are best suited for this purpose because they share common problems, life space, and destiny. It is the thesis of this paper that in modern societies the transition from the private to the public sphere generally cannot be accomplished without participation in an interconnected peer network. These age-homogenous groups provide a connecting link between the particularistic family structure and the universalistic occupational and other nonfamilial spheres. They serve as channels for the learning of various general role dispositions essential for effective participation in the main institutional spheres of adult society. For example, within adolescent peer groups, individuals are exposed to new types of discipline; they are evaluated according to their own worth and not on the basis of their place within a given family. Moreover, roles are distributed according to more universalistic criteria, and there may be more competition. While the peer group is important for the practical learning of new modes of conduct necessary for future social adjustment, it continues to maintain some connection with familial values by providing for the gratification of such need dispositions as emotional security, moral support, and group solidarity (Eisenstadt, 1956: 182-287). Because of these functions, participation in a peer group would seem to be essential for the successful integration of the particularistically oriented adolescent into the universalistic sphere of adult society. Because age-mates form a bridge between the family and the larger social structure, individuals who have not established meaningful peer relationships may be severely handicapped in their ability to make this transition. Earlier it was shown how the family characteristics of enmeshment and overprotectiveness inhibited the anorexic's development of an adequate personal network. As a consequence, she has to face adolescence alone. Lacking a peer group in which she can acquire the skills, values, and knowledge necessary for effective participation in the public domain, the anorexic remains a captive within the familial sphere. Illustrative in this regard is Sandy, who "had a difficult time in differentiating the old childhood rules from what would be appropriate behavior now that she was grown up. For instance, to show anger or any disagreement directly was outside her range of experience" (Bruch, 1978: 42). This imprisonment places the anorexic in a very awkward position. On the one hand, she is aware that with the onset of adolescence she is expected to exhibit increasing independence from her family and begin preparing for membership in adult society. On the other hand, because of her social isolation, she is unable to acquire the new patterns of behavior necessary to achieve these goals. This conflict between societal expectations and the inability to fulfill them creates intense psychological distress. At the same time that the anorexic is experiencing this distress, she is also undergoing maturational changes that accentuate her dissimilarity from the rest of her age-mates. Typically, anorexics are members of the advantaged socioeconomic classes</page><page sequence="9">ANOREXIA NERVOSA 241 and as a consequence tend to be better nourished and to have developed earlier than their nonanorexic counterparts (Sours, 1969; Crisp, 1965; 1970). Because of her greater height and weight and more developed figure, the anorexic's physical appearance sets her apart from the rest of her female classmates. Physical maturation also produces additional anxiety, since with adult size more independent behavior is expected. Most anorexics fear or hate the signs of womanhood and they tend to identify their bodies as the source of all their unhappiness (Bruch, 1978; Crisp, 1977; Casper and Davis, 1977). They think that by altering their appearance they can alleviate all their misery. As was observed earlier, the preferred means of accomplishing this among females is through reducing the consumption of food. In the words of one anorexic: I started to think hard about what it was everyone disliked about me. I didn't have to look far: it could only be my body. My face was all right and so were my large eyes and my thick black hair, but my hips were really much too broad and my ankles too thick. If I could change that, then I would never be alone again. I suddenly felt a sense of great relief. At last I had hit upon the reason for my loneliness and my despair. And I could do something positive to remedy it. I would go on a strict diet. It was like a sudden illumination and I felt perfectly content. From then on I thought of nothing else, remembered nothing at all except my monomaniacal determination to lose weight. People who worried about calorie charts just made me laugh. AU that was needed was to eat less and less. I lost all interest in meals. My mother kept pleading with me and dragging me off to doctors. I kept quiet: I only thought of gaining time and fooling them all (Palazzoli, 1974: 147). While dieting does not correct the anorexic's interpersonal problems, severe weight loss does resolve the psychological distress centered around her inability to conform to society's expectations for more independent behavior. Not only does weight loss halt further physical maturation, but the female also regresses biologically to a prepubertal role. Her menstrual periods stop and she loses her rounded feminine shape. No longer is she a developing woman, but rather has become a child in need of nurturance and care. This reduces the discrepancy that previously existed between her adult size and her inability to perform like one. As a child it is socially acceptable to remain within the family, and she can continue to function according to its familiar particularistic rules. For some anorexics this is a conscious goal. Kathy "had the desire to be a child again in relation to her parents. Five feet nine inches tall, she felt an overpowering desire, 'to be little' so that she could rely completely on her parents and have them take care of her. Kathy became convinced as her weight dropped that she was now little again" (Bruch, 1978: 66). Some investigators have asserted that the primary psychological factor in anorexia nervosa is the refusal to grow up (Meyer, 1971). This is not the position taken here. Instead the disorder is viewed as an attempt to cope with the seemingly irreconcilable conflict between societal expectations for adult behavior and the individual's inability to respond appropriately to these demands. Because the anorexic has no adolescent peer group to help her make the transition from the private to the public sphere, she is effectively imprisoned within the family. However, because her adult size creates expectations for more independent behavior, her continued attachment to the family is regarded as inappropriate. The anorexic resolves this conflict by losing weight so that in terms of size and biological functioning she becomes a child again and can legitimately remain within the family.</page><page sequence="10">242 SOCIOLOGICAL FOCUS DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY A tentative explanation can now be offered as to why anorexia nervosa appears to be almost exclusively confined to socioeconomically advantaged White female adolescents in modern industrial societies. It has been argued that the disorder is etiologically dependent upon the simultaneous presence of four specific factors: a biological predisposition, a cultural emphasis on slimness, social isolation, and a society regulated by universalism and achievement. The differential distribution of these factors intrasocietally as well as cross-culturally are seen to account for the variation in the incidence of the disorder. Since anorexia nervosa can be viewed as having its origin in the structural disjointedness of adolescence, it follows that where this period is characterized by structural continuity, the incidence of the disorder will be low. Traditional societies lack the disconnectedness endemic to modern societies because their various institutional spheres are regulated by the same particularistic criteria and values. As a consequence, the adolescent's attainment of social maturity is nonproblematic. Since the transition from the familial to the public sphere is relatively unambiguous, reliance on peers "to puzzle through its opacities" is diminished. Because the social roles allocated to the adult female ? those of wife and mother ? are governed by the same criteria as was her family of orientation, her transition from one sphere to another is even less difficult than it is for males. In this context, the lack of personal ties is irrelevant in terms of social integration, and thus loses its ability to precipitate pathological adaptations. Palazzoli noted that anorexia nervosa is rare in Bergamo, Italy, a region where "agricultural-patriarchal family patterns are still the general rule, and the children are given a traditional religious education that tends to identify the role of women with family and housework" (1974: 250). The protection against anorexia nervosa that structural continuity seems to provide may partly explain why there are no references to the disorder before the 17th century (Sours, 1969). The emergence of anorexia nervosa in less developed societies may be further retarded because they typically experience chronic food shortages. Under such conditions, obesity rather than leanness is culturally valued (Palazzoli, 1974). Because of these characteristics, then, traditional societies can be seen as antagonistic to the development of anorexia nervosa. By contrast, modern societies seem to be particularly conducive to the precipitation of the disorder. There is a consensus among major investigators that anorexia nervosa has become increasingly common in Western cultures during the past 15 to 20 years (Bruch, 1970; Theander, 1970; Duddle, 1973; Kendell et al., 1973; Halmi, 1974; Jones et al., in press). Moreover, an increase in the frequency of the disorder has also been noted in Japan, particularly among the children of professionals (Ishikawa, cited in Sours, 1969). Because these societies are governed by criteria which differ radically from those regulating family life, adolescents cannot easily attain full adult status. In this situation, age-mates are vital for the adolescent's integration into the wider society and social isolation may provoke maladaptive behavior. Isolated females may respond by voluntarily restricting their food intake. This response, dictated by their predisposition to undereat, is reinforced by the cultural emphasis on slimness.</page><page sequence="11">ANOREXIA NERVOSA 243 Although males may be subject to the same degree of stress, they are not likely to develop anorexia nervosa because they lack biological vulnerability and place little value on a small physique. Lower class females are also unlikely to develop the disorder. Like members of traditional societies, they too encounter difficulty in securing enough to eat, and hence are less likely to value a slender figure. Indeed, Huenemann et al. (1966) found that more Black than White females were concerned about underweight and wanted larger hips and/or thighs. Furthermore, because the occupational choices of lower class females are limited and hence require minimal preparation, they tend to begin work/marriage relatively early in Ufe. Thus, the disjunction between family and society is less pronounced in these classes than in those higher up the socioeconomic hierarchy. FinaUy, the incidence of anorexia nervosa is likely to be low both before and after the adolescent period because there are no further structural discontinuities that must be bridged. To summarize, in modern industrial societies, the transition from the family to the occupational sphere is much more stressful for adolescents than it is in more traditional settings. Such societies are characterized by a structural discontinuity that makes the attainment of adult status especially difficult. Because this process is heavily dependent on adolescent peer attachment, social isolates are severely handicapped in their ability to make this transition, and remain imprisoned within the famiUal sphere. This is likely to produce intense psychological distress, which in the case of females is typically attributed to some flaw in their physical appearance. This flaw is likely to be identified as excess weight. Influenced by cultural values and biologically predisposed to respond to stress by undereating, females may attempt to correct this flaw by voluntarily Umiting their caloric intake. With severe weight loss they regress biologically and thus silence demands for more independent behavior. REFERENCES Benedict, R. 1938 "Continuities and discontinuities in cultural conditioning."
