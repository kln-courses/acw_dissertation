<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE INFINITE IN A FINITE ORGANICAL PERCEPTION (ISAIAH VI 1-5) by LYLE ESLINGER Calgary "Isaiah answer'd. I saw no God, nor heard any, in a finite organical perception; but my senses discover'd the infinite in every thing...", William Blake, The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, Plate 12. Driver's Beginning In 1971 G.R. Driver published a curious rebuttal of the conven- tional English translation of Isa. vi 1, of which the Authorized Ver- sion's rendering is exemplary: "In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple." According to Driver, "whatever the Hebrew noun [sul] here used may mean, the Revised Version's 'train' cannot stand; for, so far as Accadian sculptures and Egyp- tian paintings show, men never and women rarely, if ever, had trains to their robes. Indeed, a train, which is an elongated part of a robe or skirt trailing on the ground behind the wearer, must have been barely possible in the ancient world, where ground and floor can often have been unsuitable for such appendages. " For- tunately, Driver soon abandons moot couturial speculation in favour of a philological study of the word in question. Expanding a suggestion by Abraham Geiger,2 Driver says, "the only possible rendering, then ... is 'his lower limbs' or 'extremities filled the tem- ple"' (pp. 89-90). But such blatant anthropomorphism is too crude for Driver's sense of the august Isaianic vision and he withdraws from it. "Let no one suppose, however, that the prophet will have G.R. Driver, "Isaiah 6:1 'his train filled the temple"', in H. Goedicke (ed.), Near Eastern Studies in Honor of W.F. Albright (Baltimore and London, 1971), p. 87; cf. O.

The rejected "kingly garment" (so Ivan Engnell) returns, curiously, even though the sul that Isaiah sees filling the temple is somehow a reference to God's lower appendages. Clothing is one thing, what it covers another. The mortified reaction of the prophet, in any case, encourages a less tremorous exactitude about what the prophet saw if we want to understand why it so moved him. In spite of Driver's bland conclusions, his philological investiga- tion points to some overlooked evidence that bears on this much read passage. After Driver, the conventional translation is untenable. It is surprising that the most recent translations, the New Revised Standard Version, for example, persist in "the hem of his robe filled the temple". Perhaps Driver's ambivalence about the implications of his research on the word sul allowed the editorial board of the NRSV to discount the force of his philological work. But unconnected research, since, on the world field in which sul is found4 suggests that Driver's research should be extended and pushed to a logical conclusion. Such an investigation leads to a new vision-perhaps one that Driver sensed and from which he shied- of what Isaiah saw and why it unnerved him. Philological Notes on sul Driver identified six verses, relevant for understanding Isaiah's vision, in which the word sul occurs: Isa. vi 1, xlvii 2; Jer. xiii 22, 26; Nah. iii 5; and Lam. i 9. Aside from these passages he noted one other, Exod. xxviii 33-4, in which he said the correct under- 3 Cf. Jonas Greenfield, "There can be no doubt that in this vision God ... is described as fulfilling his royal role by being seated on a high, elevated throne with his robe filling the Temple. There are no lacunae-no space left empty at the top of the lofty throne, and even more so, no telltale gap between throne and footstool, rather, an overflowing of the divine/royal gown" ("BaCal's Throne and Isa. 6:1 ", in A. Caquot, S. Legasse and M. Tardiue [ed.], Melanges bibliques et orientaux en I'honneur de M. Mathias Delcor [Kevelaer and Neukirchen-Vluyn, 1985], p. 198). Even God's legs, it seems, are too much for anyone; one wonders how Moses lived to tell of a look at the deity's back side (... wera'itd 'et-ihoray, Exod. xxxiii 23). 4 On Jer. xiii see W.L.

Chapters 1-25 (Philadelphia, 1986), pp. 414, 416. 146</page><page sequence="3">ISAIAH VI 1-5 standing of the word was clearly "hem", a prescription for the adornment of the hem of the High Priest's vestments ([n. 1] p. 88). In Driver's view, such a reading is impossible for the other six instances. On the basis of Mishnaic usage of the word, Arabic cognates (sawila and sawlatu[n]), Greek translations in the LXX (Ta 607rto), and Latin translations by Jerome (femora, pudenda, and verecundiora), Driver follows Geiger's argument that in all these cases (implicitly including Isa. vi 1) sul means "the nates of a man and der herabhangende Mutterschoss of a woman".5 Driver's argumen- tation for such a reading is sparse, consisting of three syntagmatic6 observations on the usage of sul and a fourth semantic observation based on synonymous parallelism. Having reviewed the evidence, which extends quite a bit beyond what Driver offers, it seems to me that the Geiger/Driver reading of sul as a reference to pudenda should also be applied to the occurrence in Isa. vi 1. Given the con- troversial nature of this interpretative direction, from which Driver withdrew even though his evidence pointed that way, I present a full review of the evidence here. In all, there are eleven occurrences of sul that require examina- tion: Exod. xxviii 33 (2X), 34, xxxix 25, 26; Isa. vi 1, xlvii 2; Jer. xiii 22, 26; Nah. iii 5; Lam. i 9. Exodus xxviii 33, 34, xxxix 25, 26 As Driver says (p. 88), it seems obvious that the Exodus descrip- tions of the priestly vestments involving the word sul imply nothing 5 Driver (n. 1), p. 88; Geiger (n. 2), pp. 391-2. 6 Syntagmatic relations are those patterns that occur between words regularly or normally occurring in sequence. See D. Crystal, The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language (Cambridge, 1987), p. 105, and his discussion of Saussurean principles on p. 407. In biblical circles, J.F.A. Sawyer discusses such analysis using the notions of linguistic "register", which in Sawyer's discussion seems close to what others might call generic vocabulary traits (Semantics in Biblical Research [London, 1972], pp. 17-26), and more particularly of "semantic fields." Analysing a word in its semantic field is an intuitive study of a word in the linguistic contexts in which it is found in a text (pp. 33-4). "An 'associative field' would include all the words associated in any way with a particular term. It has been described as 'a halo which surrounds the sign and whose outer fringes merge into their environ- ment', and must be distinguished from a 'lexical field' or 'group', which can be precisely defined for any given corpus. While a word's associative field includes terms related to it at all levels (for instance synonyms, opposites, terms that rhyme with it or look like it), a lexical group consists only of words very closely related to one another" (p. 30). 147</page><page sequence="4">LYLE ESLINGER more than the description of some part of the clothing. That is, no special significance is attached to the word as used in these representations of tailoring instructions (Exod. xxviii 33-4) and consequent descriptions of the construction (Exod. xxxix 25-6). The usage seems ordinary enough, nothing more than a couturial term.7 But one must be careful about weighing these instances into any general definition of suzl. At first glance, the Exodus occur- rences occupy 45% of the total of instances and they must be weighted strongly in any reckoning of the word's overall meaning and significance. That statistic must be tempered by another: Exod. xxxix 25-6 reiterates xxviii 33-4, reducing the percentage to something like 3 of 8 or 37.5 %. More precisely, one might reckon the related occurrences in Exod. xxviii and xxxix as counting for one, and the two related in Jer. xiii as also counting for one. The result is a total of six independent occurrences, and the percentage for the Exodus occurrences is in the minority at about 17 %. There are also considerations of linguistic register. The Exodus usage is technical and, one would expect, not complicated by implicit undertones or figurative language. The other occurrences, omitting Isa. vi 1 for the moment, are situated in figurative linguistic con- texts in which nearly any word is fair game for tropological treat- ment. To offer a comparable English example, the word "skirt" has eight nominal definitions in the Concise Oxford Dictionary of Cur- rent English (8th edn, 1990), p. 1139, two of which are: "1 a woman's outer garment hanging from the waist ... 5 (also bit of skirt) sl. offens, a woman regarded as an object of sexual desire".8 The analogy would be that the instructional usage of sul in Exodus could be paralleled to the first definition of skirt in the COD, while the other occurrences, again omitting Isa. vi 1 for the moment, could be likened to the fifth definition. One final argument against figuring the Exodus occurrences into a calculation of sul's significance in Isa. vi 1: one function of the priestly clothing was to sanctify the originally profane wearer for 7 An examination of less pedestrian possibilities may be found in Appendix 1: The sul and Priestly Paraphernalia. 8 In some registers of conversational Canadian English "skirt" can be used by itself as a reference to a female. In such usage the undertone of the reference is normally sexual and may be voiced by either gender. 148</page><page sequence="5">ISAIAH VI 1-5 service in the sacred sanctuary.9 Why would Yahweh, the essence of holiness, need to be so attired?

Still, in context the next injunction, "grind flour", seems a euphemistic reference to the sex act, and the mill-stones, being complementary to the business of grinding flour, are implicated by association. Furthermore, the action of grinding itself is broadly suggestive, to the human organism, of the thrusting pelvic motions essential to reproduction in mammalian copula- 9 Cf. J. Milgrom, Leviticus 1-16 (New York, 1991), pp. 548-9; J.H.

Such discussion is best placed in the context of feminist criticism. On the matter of correct contemporary response to these passages, see T. Drorah Setel, "Pro- phets and Pornography: Female Sexual Imagery in Hosea", in Letty Russell (ed.), Feminist Interpretation of the Bible (Philadelphia, 1985), pp. 94-5; Fokkelien van Dijk-Hemmes, "The metaphorization of woman in prophetic speech: an analysis of Ezekiel xxiii", VT 43 (1993), pp. 162-70. The feminist readings offer a useful counter-context to the usual "androcentric" sanctimonious sniffing at the antics of the targeted heroines in these passages. Still, moralizing is moralizing, and reac- tionary moralizing (e.g., Van Dijk-Hemmes, p. 166) is married to that against which it reacts. Avowed evaluative commentary, whether andro- or gyno-centric, is reasonably omitted from philological investigation. 11 In Deut. xxiv 6 it means only "handmill". But in Jer. xxv 10, the sound of the mill-stones is associated with the merry-making voices of bride and bridegroom (cf. Isa. lxii 5). In Exod. xi 5 rehayim seems to refer simply to mill- stones; the same is true of Num. xi 8. 149</page><page sequence="6">LYLE ESLINGER tion.12 Finally, there is also the possibility of a double entendre in rehayim alluding to the womb, rehem. The remainder of the verse contains a series of provocative solicitations for lewd exhibitionism. The suggestion of the verse seems to be that this is typical behaviour for the daugther of Babylon and that such shameless lust will bring the exhibitionist into disrepute when God exposes it.

Job xxxi 10, "May my wife grind (tithan) for another, and let others bend over her." "The verb thn 'to grind' appears in post-biblical Hebrew as a euphe- mism for sexual intercourse (a simile well known in other languages as well), but it is more than likely that this meaning is already represented in the OT... This interpretation is attested already in the LXX, Targum, Talmud (Sotah 10a...) and in mediaeval commentaries" (p. 445 of E. Ullendorff, "The Bawdy Bible", BSOAS 42 [1979], pp. 425-56). For the physiology, see Ari van Tienhove, Reproductive Physiology of Vertebrates (Philadelphia, London and Toronto, 1968), p. 299, or Volker Blim, Vertebrate Reproduction (Berlin, 1985), p. 114. 13 The meaning of samma is obscure and has a lengthy history of discussion (Driver [n. 1]). Recently Marvin H. Pope has reviewed the discussion to arrive, again, at the rendering "veil" (ob [Garden City, 1973], pp. 457-8). Pope's com- ment on the veil is important for understanding the tone of Isa. xlvii 2: The veil is supposedly intended to conceal or detract from the beauty of the female to impede and discourage unauthorized ocular enjoyment of the sub- ject. Often, however, the effect is quite opposite the alleged intent, because of the "light that lies in woman's eyes" (p. 457). The veiled temptress is burlesque, the unveiled, pornographic. Isaiah's rhetoric in ch. xlvii is aimed at exciting the wanton woman to give way to desire. The rhetoric, therefore, might be best characterized as pornographic: "intended to stimulate erotic rather than aesthetic or emotional feelings" (Concise Oxford Dic- tionary of Current English, p. 927). There is no doubt, at least, that the rhetoric is not intended to shame the wayward woman into rectitude (cf. Isa. xlvii 8-15). 14 Cross streams? A couple of innocent readings first: "Fliusse durchwaten, d.h. ohne Schleier, mit hochaufgeschiirzten Kleidern, im gemeinen Aufzug der arbeitenden Classe sich sehen lassen, m6thigenfalls auch unanstindig entbl6sst im Wasser waten": A. Dillmann, Der ProphetJesaia (Leipzig, 1890), p. 418. Cf. Ber- nhard Duhm, "Der Verf. muf in einem Lande wohnen, wo man Str6me dur- chwaten kann, wie in Palastina und Ph6nizien; am Euphrat oder Tigris oder auch nur an einem der babylonischen Schiffahrtskanale hiitte er schwerlich diese Worte geschrieben", Das BuchJesaia (4th edn, Gbttingen, 1922), p. 355. A different view finds here the same imagery as is found in Prov. v 15-18 (on which see W. McKane, Proverbs [London and Philadelphia, 1970], pp. 318-20). The recom- mended debauchery, in such a case, would progress from exhibition to intercourse-in view of xlvii 3, probably public. 15 BDB, p. 358, col. 1, 2a; cf. 2 Sam. xiii 13; Ezek. xvi 57; Prov. vi 33. 16 The shift in this line from the imperatives of the preceding lines to third- person passives (Niph'al) may be calculated to incite wanton abandonment-from active allure to passive exposure, come what may. 150</page><page sequence="7">ISAIAH VI 1-5 I shall have my vengeance and I shall encounter no opposition. Driver drew attention to this typical specimen of a prophetic motif. This example, having escaped the attentions of taxonomic form criticism, I shall label porn-expose because it seemed to contravene Driver's view that the verb glh takes only what is uncovered, not the covering, as its object in these passages (pp. 88-9). Though the rule led Driver in what I take to be the right view of these passages, it is too wooden an approach to the figurative language of prophetic poetry, which prefigures the imagism movement of early 20th- century poetry.17 One need suppose only a euphemistic metonymy. More than simply covering the ears of the prude, the metonymic indirection incites the auditor with a linguistic veil that duplicates the role of the veil that must be stripped.18 Aside from representing the genre and broadening our contact with it, Isa. xlvii 2 does not bear directly on our understanding of the word sul in Isa. vi 1. Jeremiah xiii 22 From Isa. xlvii to Jer. xiii the rhetorical target shifts from the mincing daughter of Babylon to the proud adulteress, Judah/Jerusalem (xiii 9, 27). The rhetorical function of the motif shifts too. Instead of using the sexual imagery as a vehicle to incite and thence to inflict a just revenge, Jeremiah uses it to create an image of public degradation for Judah/Jerusalem, whose shame ought to lead into repentance. Following a realistic description of the horrors of war and exile (xiii 15-20), the prophet shifts to a parallel metaphoric image of Israel's illicit relations with its "lovers" (vv. 20-1, 25, 27) as a vehicle to heighten the sense of betrayal that has provoked God to inflict such punishment. With Israel as the wayward woman and Yahweh as the humiliated hus- band, the imagery of public exposure is a perfect way to convey the 17 The goal of imagism was to use imagery as a transparent and instantaneous vehicle for representation of complex human experience.

Austin Farrer's com- ments on the impact of the imagery of the Apocalypse: "Symbol endeavours, as it were, to be that of which it speaks, and imitates reality by the multiplicity of its significance", A Rebirth of Images. The Making of St. John's Apocalypse (London, 1949), p. 19. 18 G.N.

The explicit language by which Yahweh, through the prophet, describes the public pudendal exposure is itself part of the vengeance exacted for Israel's shameful conduct.19 The graphic sexual language, in its effect on the prophetic audience, is parallel to the action it describes in that it assaults the ear and shames the object of its attention. The (assumed) religious audience is as exposed as the wayward Jerusalem, disgraced and naked for all who have eyes to see. berob Cawonek niglu sulayik nehmesu Caqebdyik "For the number of your sins, your pudenda20 will be exposed, your 'heels' violated." No observant commentator could mistake the rhetorical target here. W.L. Holladay says, "The noun sul means 'skirt' (Isa. 6:1; 'his skirts filled the temple'); here it is evidently a euphemism for the genitals. Since sulayik is repeated in v 26, it is tempting here to read suqayik 'your thigh' following the diction in Isa. 47:2 (so Rudolph): it must be admitted that 'your skirt' fits the verb in v 26 better than the verb here, and that 'your thigh' here would fit the parallelism with Caqebayik better (see below), but G gives the identical (euphemistic) translation both here and in v 26, so that it is safer to stay with M" ([n. 4] p. 414). So far as parallelism with Caqebayik is concerned, "heels" are another euphemistic reference to sexual anatomy as Holladay indicates (p. 414).21 Regarding the meaning of sul, though it is conceivable that we face here another euphemistic metonymic transference from the clothing to the principal body part it is aimed to cover, Driver's considerations on the proper object of the verb glh and the parallelism with the remainder of the verse suggest another con- sideration. "Your sulayik will be exposed, your "heels" ravaged": the parallelism indicates a closer identity between the sul and "heels". Likewise, Driver's view (pp. 88-9) that is the body and 19 As Geiger points out, it is exactly the combination of vehement and indecent assault that subsequent translators and interpreters sought to tone down in their renderings: "Diesen Misston musste man in etwas besinftigen ([n. 2] p. 390). 20 The dual here, paralleled to the "heels", suggests some body part occurring in pairs. Geiger (n. 2), p. 391, suggests "der herabhangende Mutterschoss", that is the vulva. A more precise gloss, appropriate to the explicit nature of the Hebrew, would be the labia, a natural anatomical dual. 21 See, more recently, the wide-ranging study of heels and feet, legs and thighs, in S.H. Smith, "'Heel' and 'thigh': the concept of sexuality in the Jacob-Esau narratives", VT 40 (1990), pp. 464-73. 152</page><page sequence="9">ISAIAH VI 1-5 not its covering that is exposed makes obvious sense: what humilia- tion is it to have one's dress shown round compared to having one's nakedness paraded? The only specific clues to the referent of sul come from the comparative etymological studies of Geiger (p. 391) and Driver (p. 88), both of whom find a general suggestion of some hanging protrusion. Obviously, for a female the only candidates, and with attention to the dual suffix of sulayik, are the labial projec- tions of the vulval mound.22 Jeremiah xiii 26 V. 26 augments the violent rhetoric of v. 22: berob Cawonek nigluz sulayik nehmesu Caqebdyik (cf. vv. 23, 25) wegam-4ani hasapti sulayik Cal-pdnayik wenirad qelonek Vv. 23 and 25, and subsequently especially v. 27, intensify the des- cription ofJerusalem's wanton sin against Yahweh and in response v. 26 intensifies the pornographic violence against Jerusalem. The opening words of the verse, wegam-'ani hdsapti, emphasize Yahweh's surprising first-hand role in the exposure of Jerusalem: "I myself shall ..." That God would himself take a hand in such a personal and public humiliation marks the severity of the crime, of the injury to Yahweh, and of the vengeful satisfaction that the deity takes in the punishment. Regarding the referent of sul in this occurrence, the word is set in two new and informative semantic contexts: first, in relation to the prepositional phrase Cal-pdnayik; second, in parallel to the word 22 Compare Robert P. Carroll's comment: "The use of the euphemisms may conceal an obscene practice of exposing women by drawing their legs over their heads in order to uncover their vulvas completely", Jeremiah (London and Philadelphia, 1986), p. 303. Anyone who has seen the human body in such a posi- tion, female or male, can testify that the etymological studies of Geiger and Driver are on the right track regarding the descriptive intent of the word. Carroll's elaboration of this suggestion-that the imagery alludes to atrocities against women in time of war (p. 304)-needs to be augmented. True, the imagery may be a metaphoric detailing of the realistic promise of defeat and exile (Jer. xiii 19); but what is most shocking about the imagery is that it is Yahweh, not "those com- ing from the north" (v. 20), that has so treated Jerusalem. And it is not rape, but a pornographic humiliation forJerusalem's fornications, lusty neighings, and sex- ual intrigues (ni'upayik utmishalotayik zimmat zenutek Cal-gebdaot basaddeh, v. 27). Given all that, and with a view to Jerusalem's revelry in debauchery, Yahweh runs the risk that Jerusalem may actually revel in such treatment. 153</page><page sequence="10">LYLE ESLINGER qelonek. The relation to the prepositional phrase is duplicated by a similar passage in Nah. iii 5, wegilleti sulayik Cal-pdnayik, which the AV translates as "I will discover thy skirts upon thy face." The meaning of the prepositional phrase is, "spitefully", literally "to your face".23 The parallel, created by the identical pronominal dual suffixes, between the sul-ayik and pdn-ayik is an intentional humiliating pique. The only additional information provided by the prepositional phrase, therefore, is that uncovering the sul is an act of spite. The parallel with qeldnek is more helpful. BDB (p. 886) glosses qdlon as "of nation under fig. of woman, = pudenda".24 A translation of such parallelism is, "Indeed I shall lay bare your privates to your face, your pudenda will be seen."

Two parallels are found in Job: i 11, "But stretch out your hand, touch all that he has, and (see) if he does not curse you to your face" ('im-lo Cal- pdneykdyebadkekd); and in Job vi 28, "(see) if I lie to your face" (wecal-penkem 'im- 'akazzeb). Other close parallels, meaning "in your sight" or "presence" are found in Exod. xxxiii 19 and Ps. ix 20. Holladay also rejects the outmoded reading that finds the "skirt" draped over the victim's face-"it is not that Jerusalem is deprived of sight but that her private parts are exposed" ([n. 4] p. 416). He solves the problem, and the additional one that the phrase "overloads the colon", by moving the prepositional phrase to v. 27 and repointing to read "in my presence" (Cal-pdnay). but the over-determined object sulayik Cal-pdndyik is matched by a like- wise over-determined subject: wegam- ani hisaptL. The rhetorical point is the maliciousness of the attack. 24 Cf. Holladay (n. 4), p. 416; Carroll (n. 22), p. 303.

It enshrouds the Sacred from the profane gaze. The seraphim use their wings and the house, like Sinai before it, spon- taneously fills with smoke (cdSdn, cf. Exod. xix 18, xx 15). The second consequence of this untoward collision is that profanity recoils: Isaiah is "undone" (dmh-II). Having done nothing to bring such devastation upon himself, the undoing of Isaiah is the natural consequence of profanity violating the unscreened space of the sacred. It is an inevitable and automatic consequence (cf. Exod. x 28; Num. iv 20; Deut. xviii 16). There are three developmental states, related in a causally linked series, in the description of the encounter: 27 Cf. J.G. McConville, "God's 'Name' And God's 'Glory"', Tyndale Bulletin 30 (1979), pp. 155-6. The role of the seraphim, as I shall argue, parallels that of the smoke that fills the sanctuary: to serve as a veil separating sacred and profane, here Yahweh and Isaiah. Cf. Lev. xvi 12-13 (and on that, Milgrom [n. 9], pp. 1028-31). It is of no little interest that the phrase, "that he may die" (uelo'ydmut), occurs three times regarding priests entering a sanctum in the Pentateuch (Exod. xxviii 35; Lev. xvi 2, 13). In all cases, it is tied to description of a vehicle for main- taining the separation of sacred and profane (the priests' breeches, the smoke screen). 28 The deity's tremendous sanctity-the symbolically complete trishagion "holy, holy, holy" (on the repetition see the discussion and bibliography in H. Wildberger, Isaiah 1-12 [Minneapolis, 1991], p. 265 = Jesaja 1: Jesaja 1-12 [Neukirchen-Vluyn, 1972], p. 248) being an effort to reinvoke the violated state-is matched, though only two for three, by Isaiah's self-description as a man of unclean lips dwelling among a like-lipped people. 156</page><page sequence="13">ISAIAH VI 1-5 Voice Vision Physiological Additional descriptor Isaiah God, exposed, in the temple sildyw filling the temple Isaiah seraphim (respective position wings and their the seraphim to God) purposes relate their attitude to God's manifestation Isaiah Isaiah's self description; Reiteration of seraphic Isaiah relates physiological descriptor-an vocalization his attitude, unclean lipped fellow having seen the sacred nakedness The first state is that of the sacred alone, in and of itself, unguarded against the intrusion of a profanity such as the unclean prophet.29 But God is not simply home alone; he sits exposed, his nakedness filling the temple. Driver's beginning now needs to be drawn to its logical conclusion: what Isaiah sees is God's genitals. The normal usage of this word in the prophetic corpus leaves little room to evade this conclusion. The vision of God's pudenda is unparalleled in the Bible and it is precisely this vision of the Holy One's nakedness that explains the chain of events that unwinds. Before reviewing the confirmation of subsequent context, how should we understand the statement that God's sul fills the temple. Is Yahweh's sul like El's hand, "long as the sea"?30 A Hebrew Priapus? The resemblance is only superficial, for the point of priapic statuary and the Ugaritic text is virility. Here, as in the other prophetic uses of the term, the reference to sul is calculatedly explicit. One must not retreat to a bowdlerizing shell, thus emasculating the visionary rhetoric. In the vision, what Isaiah sees is God's pudenda; filling the temple as they do, probably his penis. 29 In v. 5 Isaiah focuses on the fact of having impure "lips" because he is unable, therewith, to add his "Amen" to the sanitizing Sanctus of the seraphim (cf. E. Jenni, "Jesajas Berufung in der neueren Forschung", TZ 15 [1959], p. 322). But the organ of speech is impure because the man is, through and through, impure before the raw holiness he experiences. 30 On El's hand, see Marvin Pope, El in the Ugaritic Texts, SVT 2 (1955), pp. 38-40; "Ups And Downs In El's Amours", Ugarit Forschungen 11: Festschrift fur Claude F.A. Schaeffer (1979), p. 705. 157</page><page sequence="14">LYLE ESLINGER To ascribe such an appendage to God is to duplicate something of the shock that Isaiah's report seems aimed at. The use of a coarse word aims to convey to his audience something of the prophet's own shock at what he saw in the temple. In the context of academic discourse, "God's penis" functions like Yahweh's sul in the temple vision of Isaiah. But is saying such more than ribaldry for its own sake? Is there, as in the other prophetic uses of the word, some point to this description of God's anatomy? The answer, of course, is decidedly so. More than coarse language-though it shares that trait with the references to female anatomy in the other instances of the word in the prophetic corpus-sul is essentially metaphoric in Isaiah's des- cription of God.31 The coarseness of the register does not fade; it seems augmented, rather, in reference to the divinity. But the essential point is not to reveal that God is a man with a male member.32 What is essential is to reproduce, in words, the shocking core of the visionary encounter: a sacred nakedness, unshielded by 31 The history of scholarship on Isa. vi 1 shows, at times, an incapacity to deal with metaphor. Johannes Hehn, in his attack on the reading of s.ul as "train" ("Schleppen") says that in addition to philological considerations it is a "grotes- que notion": "aber ein Gewand von solcher Fiille des Stoffes, dass bei dem Sitzenden die Schleppen den Tempel erfullen (!), is wirklich eine groteske Vorstellung": "swlym Is. 6,1 = 'Schleppen'? Die Bedeutung von swl und Pwl", BZ 14 (1916/17), pp. 15-24 (p. 19). Whether or not "Schleppen" is a correct rendering, the probability is that the filling of the temple is hyperbole, like metaphor a variant of linguistic transfer, not a volumetric analysis. 32 Carl Jung passes close to the point: The phallus functions as an all-embracing symbol in the Hindu religion [sic], but if a street urchin draws one on a wall, it just reflects an interest in his penis. Because infantile and adolescent fantasies often continue far into adult life, many dreams occur in which there are unmistakable sexual allusions. it would be absurd to understand them as anything else. But when a mason speaks of monks and nuns to be laid upon each other, or an electrician of male plugs and female sockets, it would be ludicrous to suppose that he is indulging in glowing adolescent fantasies,. He is simply using colorful descriptive names for his materials. When an educated Hindu talks to you about the Lingam (the phallus that represents the god Siva in Hindu mythology), you will hear things we Westerns would never connect with the penis. The Lingam is certainly not an obscene allusion; nor is the cross merely a sign of death. Much depends upon the maturity of the dreamer who produces such an image. ... The interpretation of dreams and symbols demands intelligence (Man and his Symbosl [London, 1964], p. 81). Yahweh's sutl is what it is-some part of sexual anatomy-but it needs to be interpreted. 158</page><page sequence="15">ISAIAH VI 1-5 the usual cultic prophylatic.33 God, as manifest and experienced in the cultic institution, is sanitized and the experience is regularized, normalized. The institutionalized cultic experience of God remains profane, part of the regular profane world. The liturgy hopes for more; the reality is usually less. What Isaiah's description conveys is that his was not a regularized, sanitized experience of the sacred. He sees God's own nakedness, a sacred presence engorged in the temple. Religious language that attempts to describe the sacred is essentially metaphoric: the sul of God is no different. Ironically, even to call the sul a "sacred presence" is to profane the metaphor.34 The vision of the holy unadorned private leads on to the next state: the intervention of the seraphim. The vision is not static; the sequence in description follows the action sequence that the prophet witnessed and in which he participated. Many readers35 have com- mented on how quickly the report turns from the brief description of divinity to the temple environs, as though the prophet ran out of things to say about the Ineffable (so Dillmann [n. 14], r. 55). But the change in what is perceived seems not the consequence of any lack of imagination or pious restraint in describing the ineffable, else there would have been plenty that would come to mind before God's genitals flooding the temple. It is not that Isaiah, as reporter, runs out of things to say; it is that Isaiah's intrusion is itself cut short. His perception switches from God to those beings/things that intervene to protect the sacred vulnerability from the sight of a pro- fane being. Two things intervene to separate the sacred god from the profane prophet: the wings of the seraphim (v. 2) and the smoke that fills 33 Cf. Keel (n. 1), p. 54: "Der prophet erfahrt die sonst verborgene Anwesenheit Jahwes im Jerusalemerheiligtum als eine Prasenz von derselben intensiven Gewalt, die der unverhiillten himmlischen Heiligkeit Jahwes eignet. Statt im Himmel (vgl. Ps 29.2) oder durch Symbole verhiillt oder gemildert ist diese Heiligkeit in der Vision des Jesaja unmittelbar mitten in Israel und engstens mit dem herrscherwillen Jahwes verbunden gegenwartig. Darob erbeben Tempel und Prophet" (also pp. 55-6). 34 4... metaphor is primary language, and metaphor cannot be reduced to another kind of language": Northrop Frye, "The Journey as Metaphor", in R.D.

The seraphim positioned36 above (mimmaCal) intervene first. In the face of the profane invasion, the first thing to do is screen the sacred nakedness. The seraphim do this with their wings. A problem related to how one reads the word suil is how one determines the personal reference of the undetermined per- sonal pronouns in v. 2. Conventional translations, such as the new Jewish Publication Society version or the New American Standard Ver- sion, read the verse as follows: Seraphim stood above Him, each having six wings; with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew (NASV)37 This unambiguous translation-an assumed 3rd-person masculine singular pronominal reference to the deity is indicated by capitaliz- ing the pronoun, those to the seraphim begin with a lower-case letter-is based on an ambiguous Hebrew text. The Hebrew per- mits the following division into semantic units:38 serdpim Comedim mimmacal 16 ses kendpfm ses kendpim le)ehdd bistayim yekasseh pdnayw ubiRtayim ykasseh ragldyw ubistayim yedopep The mirroring chiamsus within the second line is itself reason 36 My reading is that the seraphim are located by flying (yeCpep) and that the participle Comedtm in v. 2 describes only their relative spatial position with respect to the deity. The newJPS version extends the physical description further towards the metaphorical: "Seraphs stood in attendance on him" (my emphasis). 37 The NRSV goes a step further, rendering the ambiguous 3rd-person masculine singular pronominal suffixes as unambiguous 3rd-person plurals. "Their faces ... their feet" can refer only to the seraphim. The clarification is complemented by a psychological interpretation of the vision's contents: ... seized with emotion, [Isaiah] saw the visible scene replaced by a vision of Yahweh the king. There he was enthroned, with the seraph attendants about him hiding their faces that they might not behold his glory. The swirling incense-smoke which filled the Temple became the train of Yahweh's robes, the antiphonal shouts of the choirs the voices of the seraphs praising the God who is thrice holy, exalted, utterly unapproachable, whose glory fills all the earth (comment on Isa. vi 1-5 in The New Oxford Annotated Bible, p. 494). 38 Even without this division, the larger structure of the unit supports the argu- ment that I shall make on the basis of this division and other contextual con- siderations. 160</page><page sequence="17">ISAIAH VI 1-5 enough to question the accepted reading, "Seraphim stood above Him." "Seraphim stood above" is enough, leaving the subsequent 16 to balance the latter half of the second line: "to him six wings, six wings to each". Still we do not know whether the first "to him" refers to God, the six wings devoted to his protection, or the seraphim. The assumption behind the conventional translation is that the seraphim must cover both their faces, to avoid viewing the Holy One, and their euphemistic "feet", to avoid any pudendal offense to the deity.39 (The three "hear, speak, and see no evil monkeys" come to mind.) But a study of the context suggests, rather, that the unidentified person whose "feet" and face are covered, or better shielded, is Yahweh, not the seraphim. Given the philological argu- ment regarding sul, there is a more obvious being than the seraphim,40 with "feet" in need of modesty. But the case for identi- fying Yahweh as the referent of the ambiguous pronouns in v. 2 can be made from structural parallels alone. The structural arrange- ment then stands as independent support for the philological argu- ment about the referent of sul. 39 E.g., W. Eichrodt's comment, "As heavenly ministers they stand by the enthroned God in deep reverence, covering faces and feet with their wings. In possessing human voices and hands they resemble the cherubim, but differ from them in having a serpent's body" (Theology of the Old Testament 2 [London and Philadelphia, 1961], p. 204 = Theologie des Alten Testaments 2/3 [5th edn, Stuttgart and G6ttingen, 1964], p. 318. The translation of the euphemistic "feet" into "genitals" is widespread in the commentary; e.g., I. Engnell, The Call of Isaiah. An Exegetical and Comparative Study (Uppsala, 1949), p. 16; Smith [n. 2], p. 466, n. 6; D.M.C. Englert, "Bowdlerizing in the Old Testament", in H.M. Bream, R.D. Heim and C.A. Moore (ed.), A Light unto My Path. Old Testament Studies in Honor of Jacob M. Myers (eds. H.N. Bream, R.D. Heim and C.A. Moore (Philadelphia, 1974), p. 142. The consequent effort to envision the morphology of the seraphim has been thoroughly documented by Keel (n. 1), pp. 71-109. 40 The physiology of the seraphim, about which we know so little, has mostly been based on a reading of Isa. vi 2 combined with etymological interpretations of their name and its putative relation to the verb srp.

Gaster, "The six-winged seraphim have been traditionally identified as flaming angels, but this rests solely on a fanciful association of the word with the Hebrew s-r-ph, 'burn"' [Myth, Legend, and Custom in the Old Testament 2 (New York, 1969), p. 567]) and the attempts to arrive at a conclusive physiological description on the basis of the thin evidence provided by Isa vi. 161</page><page sequence="18">LYLE ESLINGER The God-awful vision is framed by parallel first-person reports of his own actions from Isaiah: "I saw", (wd'er'eh) ... "I said," (wdaomar). First the raw perception; then its interpretation and con- sequence. The consequence of such connection is marked by another parallel, now contrastive, that explains why Isaiah is traumatized by the vision. Having seen God "sitting" (adodndy yoseb) on the throne, Isaiah is "undone" because he is one of unclean lips "existing amongst" (adnoki yoseb) a people of unclean lips. The literary link between the sacred God and the profane prophet by way of the verbysb illustrates the dangerous proximity into which the encounter brings the two. The two contrasting adverbial prepositional phrases that modify these parallel instances of the verb ysb-Cal-kisse) ram wenissa) // betok Cam-teme) epdtayim- describe the polar opposition between the holy God and profane prophet and show why the prophet must suffer the effect of their natural repulsion. The underlying presumption, of course, is that in such an encounter flimsy profanity will be repelled harder than stolid sacredness. The shrouding process that unfolds in the space between Isaiah's vision and his woefilled utterance takes the theophany from a raw manifestation of holiness, the sul filling the temple (wesuladyw meleFzm 'et-hahekdl), to a cultically mediated, normalized manifestation through the smoke that fills the house (wehabbayit yimmaleg) Ccdn). The verbal parallelism (meleim 1/ yimmale) marks the beginning and end states. But even the parallel verbs show a transition from the activity of the deity in v. 1-his sul filled the temple-to the passivity of the house being filled by smoke in v. 4. And though it is possible that the word pair "temple/house" is simple parallel variation, the fact that hahekdl refers only to the residences of gods and kings, while habbayit refers equally to a common residence sup- ports the impression of a transition from a raw manifestion of the sacred to the conventional profane sacredness that is characteristic of the cult. The intervention that begins the process of normalizing this theophany is the physical intrusion of the seraphim between Isaiah's eyes and the sacred sutl. The second stage, which parallels the first and progresses in those parallels, is focused on the cultic word, a cultic invocation that brings the seraphic work to its conclu- sion. The two-tiered action is as follows: 162</page><page sequence="19">ISAIAH VI 1-5 a Yerdpim Comedim mimmacal 16 ses kendpayim ses kendpayim le)ehdd b bistayim yekasseh panayw ubistayim yekasseh ragldyw ubistayim yeCpegp a' weqdrda zeh 'el-zeh we)dmar b' qddos qdds qdddos yhwh sebdaot c melo ' kol-hdadres kebodo Immediately on Isaiah's seeing what he ought not to see, the six- winged ministers, stationed above (mimmacal) the deity, cover key parts of his anatomy: first the face (pdndyw) and then the exposed pudenda (ragldyw). The face is covered in accord with the taboo regarding the face of God (Exod. xxxiii 20), the pudenda in accord with a shame culture (cf. Gen. ix 22-3; Exod. xx 26, xxviii 42; Lev. xviii 6-19, xx 11, 17-21)41 but most especially in accord with the immediate need to shield this corporeal holy of holies from exposure to Isaiah's glance.42 The structural arguments in favour of Yahweh as owner of face and feet are: 1. that the 3rd-person masculine singular pronominal references in vv. 2-3 then consistently refer to Yahweh. There are no formal indicators to suggest any switch in the identity of the person referred to by these pronouns. The first and the last ("seraphim stood above him, and "the whole eart is full of his glory") are unambiguous. There is no warrant for the assumption that the 41 According to Ullendorff, the "sight of the naked body connotes loss of dignity" ([n. 12] p. 433). "Similarly, any form of indecent exposure must be avoided on sacred ground" (p. 433). Cf. David Daube on Deut. xxv 11-12 ("The Culture of Deuteronomy", Orita [Ibadan] 3 [1969], pp. 36-7). Daube says that in the culture of the book of Deuteronomy sex and by implication its organs are the root of all shame. 42 The temple veil (pdroket) fulfilled the same function-a screen to keep most sacred and profane separate in the sanctioned place for their interaction (Exod. xxx 6). And as the paroket was itself part of the sacred order (see Menahem Haran, Temples and Temple-Service in Ancient Israel. An Inquiry into the Character of Cult Phenomena and the Historical Setting of the Priestly School [Oxford, 1978], p. 162), it is appropriate that it is the ministering seraphim that intervene to re-establish the bounds of sacred and profane. 163</page><page sequence="20">LYLE ESLINGER unspecified referent of the intervening pronouns has changed.43 2. The pronominal target of the three-fold wing action in "b" parallels the target of the trishagion in "b'," i.e., "he" (Yahweh) parallels "Yhwh Sebaoth". 3. The situation also argues for Yahweh as the unidentified possessor: he is the only one, thus far, who has some comple- ment that might resemble an exposed "foot". 4. Biblical physiology provides no support for seraphim with faces or feet. Though no other passage makes reference to Yahweh's male appendage, he certainly has been given a face elsewhere and his gender, and so by natural extension his sex, is masculine. 5. The most important warrant for reading Yahweh as the object of the seraphims' cloaking action is the nature of the process that is developing and the parallel, within that process, between the three-fold covering action of the wings, the trishagion, and the smoking house. The two-staged action of the seraphim is essen- tially cultic:44 its purpose is to re-establish the bounds between sacred and profane. Three sets of wings hide the holy nakedness; three "holy" invocations heal the rifted sacredness. The two sets of three-fold prophylaxis are themselves made triple by a third when the house spontaneously fills with smoke, thus seal- ing the cloaking action begun by the wings of the seraphim.45 The second part of the seraphim's action, the utterance of the "Trisagion", takes a giant step towards the normal cultic version of theophany. The liturgical nature of the three-fold saying is com- 43 Perhaps the combination of the widely acknowledged euphemistic reading of regel and the sense of impropriety in attributing such to God may help to explain why this assumption has been so universal in the reading history of this text. 44 Jenni, "Es is auffallend, wieviel Elemente dieser Liturgie in Jes. 6 wiederkehren. Schone der Name Jahwe Zebaoth, wie immer er auch inhaltlich zu erklairen sein mag, ist urspriinglich speziell der Kultname des auf dem Zion in Jerusalem verehrten Gottes. Aber auch die Wendung 'die Erde und ihre Fiille', das Konigtum Jahwes, seine Heilikeit und sein kabod, seine Herrlichkeit, sind in der Jerusalemer Tradition zu Hause" ([n. 29], p. 331). Cf. Engnell (n. 39), p. 30: "They [Isaiah and Micaiah ben Imlah] both make use of a common fund of traditionally given material that is, in its turn, of cultic origin." 45 Milgrom provides a fascinating review of Jewish efforts to understand the related functions of incense and smoke as propitiary and cloaking agents, respect- ively ([n. 9] pp. 1024-31). Incense itself is not involved in Isaiah's, vision, though some interpreters see in the visionary smoke an actual occurrence of priestly incen- diarism (see above, n. 34). 164</page><page sequence="21">ISAIAH VI 1-5 monly observed.46 What has been missed is the leap from the reality of God's naked presence to a formulized verbal substitute. The gulf that separates the conjured version of presence in v. 3 from the reality of v. 1 can be mapped using the two reference points where the being to whom Isaiah refers as "my Lord" (Qadonay) intrudes in the narrative. In v. 1 Isaiah actually sees "my Lord"; afterwards (v. 8; cf. v. 11) he only hears a voice-the normal connection between prophet and deity. The seraphim invoke God as Yahweh Sebaoth, this exalted and awe-inspiring epithet serving to reposi- tion the deity on high after the shocking indecent contact in the temple. Both deity and prophet are restored by this incantation: the former thus resanctified, the latter thus encouraged to relapse into familiar patterns of cultic profanity. There is yet a final twist to the restorations of the seraphim. Their concluding line, "The whole earth is full (meldo) of his glory", parallels a line in v. 1: "his suil filled (mele^m) the temple". The verbal parallel by way of the verb "fill" (ml) only makes more obvious a strong conceptual parallel: in both instances a theophanic manifestation swells to occupy available space. But once again the seraphic version is a theological substitute to assuage the awesome spectacle. In place of the temple-filling organ of God the seraphim invoke a concept: the glory of God that suffuses all the earth. The success of the seraphic rhetoric, which is aimed to redirect the prophet's mind into acceptable paths for thinking of God,47 is not 46 E.g., Wildberger (n. 28), p. 265, "Without a doubt, the Trisagion was part of the liturgy in the Jerusalem cult. The adoration by the heavenly being serve as a model for the adoration which the earthly community is to replicate" (= Ger- man, p. 248). 47 Cf. Yehoshua Gitay, Isaiah and his audience. The structure and meaning of Isaiah 1-12 (Assen and Maastricht, 1991), "The conception of the 'holy' and 'glory' ('presence') are stressed to fit the report's aim; to affect the audience, to re- establish feelings of awe and power about God, who again is referred to as the 'Lord of Hosts'" (p. 123). Gitay's comment captures the rhetorical aim, but errs, in my opinion, in attributing this rhetoric to Isaiah. These are the words of the seraphim trying to calm and reorient the prophet; they are not the words of the prophet trying to affect his audience. In principle, one might grant that what a prophet reports by way of narrative might be intended, lock, stock and barrel, for appropriation by his audience. But here it would seem that Isaiah, framing his narrative report as he has, discriminates and intends for his audience to distinguish between what he saw and what he was told to "see" thereafter. The subject of voice-structure and intended audience in the rhetoric in and of the pro- phetic books of the Bible remains a rich and mostly untouched field of research. Gitay's pioneering work on Isaiah, nevertheless, points the way. 165</page><page sequence="22">LYLE ESLINGER marked in Isaiah's narrative. The prophet is prevented from reciprocating by his consciousness of abject profanity, a con- sciousness provoked by what he has seen, not the sanctimonious versicle of the seraphim. But that their rhetoric does work is attested by the abundant theological response of modern commen- tators.48 The last of the three sanctified reactions to the encounter between deity and prophet is set off by the seraphim, by the sound of their shouting (miqqdl haqqorP). "The pivots on the thresholds49 shook at the voices of those who called, and the house filled with smoke" (NRSV). Here the third change on the verb ml) is rung: wesuldyw mele)im et-hahekdl (v. 1) melo) kol-hdadres kebodo (v. 3) wehabbayityimmdae Csadn (v. 4) The circle is complete here, from naked manifestation to cultic simulacrum. What began in the "temple" (hekdl) ends in the "house" (bayit). The quaking building and the smoke-filled house are the conventional indicators of a theophany.50 Simulation though it may be, in comparison with what Isaiah has seen, the spontaneous production of "smoke" (Casd)n) points to the original theophany at Sinai: wekol-hdCdm rod'm )et-haqqolot we)et-hallappidim we)et qol hassopdr we't- hdhar Cdsen wayyar' hdCdm wayyanuu7c wayyacamedui merdhoq (Exod. xx 18). The two events are explicitly linked by the "smoke" and by the tot- tering (nwC) of people and "doorposts". The connection seems aimed to remind the sole human observer, the prophet, of the proper place for human observers ("far off", merdhoq) and of the unacceptable breach that his profane presence has made in the uniquely sanctified temple. But most of all, the reaction of the tem- ple building takes the unacceptably unparalleled encounter with God that Isaiah has had and reforms it in the image of Sinai. How- 48 E.g., Wildberger, who supplies two full pages of theological reflection and cites similar reactions from preceding commentators ([n. 28] pp. 266-7 = Ger- man, pp. 249-50). 49 The specific referent of the words commonly translated "thresholds" is explored in Appendix 3: 'ammot hassippim in Isa. vi 4. 50 Cf.

There remains one final party in this business of sealing up the breach that Isaiah's innocent intrusion has caused, namely, the prophet himself. The whole affair is bracketed, as previously noted, by Isaiah's first-person reportage: "I saw ... and I said" (vv. 1 and 5). There is yet another linkage that helps to understand why Isaiah's response to the seraphic "versicle" is so unequal to their cultic normalization. The contrast is between the sacredness of the deity and the profanity of the prophet: Yahweh "sits/exists" ('adondy yoeb) on a throne, high and lofty in the sacred temple (v. 1); the prophet "sits/exists" ('dnokiyoseb) as one among a people of polluted lips (v. 5). The lexical link foregrounds the categorical disparity. Many commentators have suggested that the reason Isaiah is dumbfounded is that his profane status does not qualify him for an acceptable formal response to the seraphic paean.51 "It is generally supposed that Isaiah is desirous of joining with the Seraphim in the song of praise, but feels himself unworthy" (Kisane [n.], p. 75). Kissane's comment misses the double-entendre in Isaiah's self-description, "I am undone/dumbfounded."52 It is not just that Isaiah would like to join in praise with the seraphim; he must do so to complete the process of normalizing the encounter. Should he not be able to echo and so assent to the process, he stands as a profanity that has seen something far more damning than the face of God and he, naturally, will be "undone". But as one whose speech-for which "lips" are a metonym, and that itself for Isaiah's linguistically circumscribed consciousness-is fundamen- tally impure,53 no response from Isaiah could complement the pro- 51 Cf. Dillmann (n. 14), p. 59; Duhm (n. 14), p. 67. 52 Roberts suggests that the verb nidmeti is used as a double entendre: On first reading it seems as though Isaiah meant he was literally undone; but when we read, subsequently, about the unclean lips we pick up a second, complementary reading: "I am unable to speak" ([n. 26], pp. 44-6). 53 J.T. Willis's comment on the cultic side of Isaiah's despair is important: "Some think the phrase 'a man of unclean lips' means Isaiah felt unworthy to join the heavenly seraphim in singing praise to God's holiness (vs. 3; cf. Exod. 33:20; Judg. 13:22). This may in part be involved. However, the phrase 'unclean lips' calls to mind Leviticus 13:45: 'The leper who has the disease shall wear torn clothes and let the hair of his head hang loose, and he shall cover his upper lip and cry, "Unclean, unclean"' .", Isaiah (Austin, Texas, 1980), p. 141. C.F. Whitley also points to the cultic background of the term tm' that Isaiah uses to characterize his state ("The Call and Mission of Isaiah", JNES 18 [1959], p. 41). 167</page><page sequence="24">LYLE ESLINGER cess initiated by the seraphim. Isaiah's cry of despair signals his willingness to purify his vision through cultic normalization. But a cry of despair is not the formal response that the situation requires. That is why one of the seraphim, initiators of the normalization, purifies Isaiah: to complete the procedure by allowing Isaiah the opportunity to repress the image that he has seen.54 Before Isaiah has a chance to voice an acceptable response the voice of God himself intrudes for the first time in the scene. God's question issues an invitation for Isaiah to rejoin the normal heilsgeschichtliche process from which his accidental vision removed him. "Whom shall I send, who will go for us?" invites not simple profane action, but action of the same synergistic quality in which sacred and profane interface though acceptable, established media (such as the cult or divinely designated human representatives). Isaiah is invited to return to his distanced role as the prophet who might speak on God's behalf, forgetting his experience as a man who has seen God's sul filling the temple. Isaiah's second speech ("I said", wdo6mar; cf. v. 5) accomplishes what his first could not. "Here am I" seems an intentional echo of Moses' own "here am I" when God sought him in the same capacity (hinnenl; Exod. iii 4). Here, finally, Isaiah issues his positive response to the invitation of the quaking, smoke-filled house. Gone is the vision of a naked god; all that remains are the exodus process and culticized theophany. The prophet caps his reiteration of the Mosaic "here I am" by going one better. Where Moses had only excuses with which to answer the call to action, Isaiah adds an unqualified "send me" (selaheni). The question why Isaiah would repeat such a scandalous report to any audience remains. Such a question, of course, depends on the assumption that the literature in the book of Isaiah should be understood as having once been so addressed. Yehoshua Gitay rightly claims that we need to pay attention to the prophet's rhetorical purpose whenever we read any of the oracles of visions in a prophetic book ([n. 47] pp. 4-6, 117-20). So the question 54 Ibn Ezra's comment on why the seraphim are so called-"The prophet calls them 'Seraphim'-i.e., 'burning ones'-because they seared his mouth"- encapsulates my reading of the role of the seraphim as the ones who restore order out of the chaos caused by Isaiah's vision. The act of searing Isaiah's impure lips is last in a series of actions all designed to heal the breach caused by Isaiah's vision. See M. Friedlander (ed. and tr.), The Commentary of Ibn Ezra on Isaiah (London, 1873; reprinted New York, 1964), p. 34. 168</page><page sequence="25">ISAIAH VI 1-5 naturally arise, given the successful reintegration that concludes the vision, why report such a disastrous encounter at all? And more specifically, why duplicate the offensive suggestion that God might have an organ, let alone the treacherous account of how one hap- pened to see this thing in the temple? One can easily construct any number of scenarios. Perhaps it comes of a sense of historical duty, recording all that was seen or said of God. One might then report while sanitizing the record by use of euphemistic description to cover the indelicate parts. But the euphemistic description is insufficient protection, at least if the usage underlying the other prophetic instances of the word is known to one's audience. Perhaps the account was never intended for public consumption-a fragment of esoterica for a prophetic school of initiates. The euphemistic touches that we have seen might then have been the tell-tale traces of subsequent redaction, making the old and sacred traditions acceptable for public con- sumption. The text itself supplies little to support or refute these or any like- minded contextual fabrications. What it reflects is an experience of divinity unequalled in the history of divine-human encounter in the Old Testament. As a so-called "call narrative", this one could only be a failure because of its potential for embarrassment to the deity and embarrassment or even death to anyone who might lay claim to its visionary content. But as a metaphorical record of one human being's encounter with the Ultimate, it reigns supreme in the Bible. Only Moses' exclusive view of Yahweh's backside (ahodrdy, Exod. xxxiii 23) approaches this level of intimacy with the deity's physi- que. But Moses' vision, from our view, is the "small vehicle". So far as its biblical description goes, it is featureless and its secrets die with Moses on the mountain top. Only Isaiah's metaphorical des- cription of this epiphany offers readers an anamorphic perspective on the deity.55 Those who study it carefully will discover, individually, the singular perspective necessary to learn from this oddest of Yahwistic representations. 55 Like Isaiah's outrageous metaphor, anamorphic perspective stimulates the mind precisely by the incongruity between first, uncorrected and final, corrected impressions. The chaos of an image viewed "literally", from a natural perspective is discovered as orderliness when viewed from an artificial (metaphorical) point of view. The anamorphic tradition in art is described by Jurgis Baltrusaitis, Anamor- phoses ou magie artificielle des effets merveilleux (Paris, 1969; E. tr. Anamorphic Art [Cam- bridge, 1976]). 169</page><page sequence="26">LYLE ESLINGER APPENDIX 1: THE SUL AND PRIESTLY PARAPHERNALIA On p. 148 above, I maintained that no special significance is attached to the word sul in descriptions of priestly vestments in Exodus. I would temper this certainty with two pieces of evidence. First, the hem of the ephod robe (Exod. xviii 34, Cal-suldyw; for the distinction between the ephod and the ephod robe see Menahem Haran [n. 42), p. 168) is to be adorned round about with interspersed pomegranate and golden bells. This adornment, and by implication the ephod itself, functions as a prophylactic to keep Aaron alive while in the presence of Yahweh (Exod. xxviii 35, weldo ydmut; cf. Exod. xx 26). Shortly thereafter in the text, another undergarment with a similar function is mandated. The linen breeches (miksene-bdd) for Aaron and his ministering son (v. 41) are to cover their pudenda (beSar Cerwa mimmotnayim weCad-yerekayim) so that they raise no offense, exposing their profane nakedness in the sanctuary, and die (welJo-yiSu Cawon wdmetu); compare, on this same passage, Maimonides' distinctions between the practice of the Israelite priests and the worshippers of "Pehor" (Baal-Peor), whose presence, according to Maimonides, required exhibitionism before the cult symbol of the deity (cited from G.R. Scott, Phallic Worship. A History of Sex and Sex Rites in relation to the Religions of all Races from Antiquity to the Present Day [corrected reprint, London, 1966], p. 106, who himself cites Thomas Lewis, Origines Hebraeae 3 [London, 1725], p. 71). On the referents of mtnym andyrk see, for the latter, L. Eslinger, "The case of an immodest lady wrestler in Deuteronomy xxv 11-12", VT 31 (1981), pp. 273-4, n. 18; S.H. Smith (n. 21), p. 466, who cites S. Gevirtz in support; for the former, Job xl 16 and Pope (n. 13), pp. 323-4. A similar marker of the potential offensiveness of profane humanity's shameful (speaking in the biblical voice) animal functions is the law of the latrine in Deut. xxiii 13-15 (Eng. 12-14), which specifically describes the act or consequence of defecation as an indecent thing (Cerwat ddbdr), and mandates a latrine outside the camp so that it may be "holy" (qddos) enough for the holy God to abide it. Cf. Daube's discussion of Deuteronomy's "shame culture" (n. 41), pp. 31, 32, 47, 50. Daube interprets the law as part of Deuteronomy's effort to inculcate a sense of shamefulness before God, who views all one's actions. But the fact that v. 15 makes 170</page><page sequence="27">ISAIAH VI 1-5 specific reference to the need for a sanctified camp in which the holy God may walk supports, better, a reading in terms of the margin between sacred and profane. The parallel protection afforded by the two pieces of underclothing suggests a parallel function: to cover the priest's private parts and thus to avoid desecration and its consequence. Cf. T. Frymer-Kensky, "Sex and Sexuality", The Anchor Bible Dic- tionary 5 (New York, 1992), p. 1146: "All hints of sexuality were to be kept far away from cultic life and religious experience." (Frymer-Kensky's statement that "God does not represent male virility, and is never imaged below the waist" is questionable in view of Isa. vi 1.) The second piece of evidence suggesting a metonymic reference in the usage of sul in Exodus is the pomegranates (rimmon) sewn round this skirt (Exod. xxviii 33-4). The pomegranate widely sym- bolizes sexual fecundity, as it does also in ancient Near Eastern literature: I. Jacob and W. Jacob, "Flora", The Anchor Bible Dic- tionary 2, p. 808. (Pope recognizes the sexual symbolism of the pomegranate in SS. iv 13, which is a metaphor of the lady's "groove", as Pope calls it. Oddly, he does not come to a similar conclusion regarding the slit pomegranate of SS. iv 3: Song of Songs [Garden City, 1977], p. 464.) For broader discussion of the pomegranate as a fertility symbol see Friedrich Muthmann, Der Granatapfel. Symbol des Lebens in der alten Welt (Bern, 1982), pp. 35-8, 48-52, 64-6. The pomegranate and bell encircled sul, then, may be a symbolic way to sanitize and sacralize the pudenda covered beneath the gament. The pomegranate was a cultically acceptable symbol of the sex organs; the symbol works both ways to bridge the realms of sacred and profane, allowing one to intrude into the other. The position of the pomegranates round the suil and interspersed with the bells also suggests an analogous prophylactic, rather than a purely ornamental, function. The interspersed bells gave an audible warning of the priest's intrusion into the sanctuary (Exod. xxviii 35)-a common function of bells on clothing that per- sists today in the "bear bell", worn by cautious hikers in grizzly country. For somewhat broader discussion of the sexual register in Biblical Hebrew see Ullendorff (n. 12), pp. 425-56. Ullendorff's work makes a beginning on a neglected aspect of biblical research. Most of the existing literature, books such as M.R. Cosby's Sex in the 171</page><page sequence="28">LYLE ESLINGER Bible. An Introduction to What the Scriptures Teach Us About Sexuality (Englewood Cliffs, NewJersey, 1984), or T.M. Horner's Sex in the Bible (Rutland, Vermont, 1974), offer little more than Sunday school sanitations of the Bible's bawdy. APPENDIX 2: SUL AND QALON The parallel in Nah. iii 5 uses the same pair, sul and qdldn, and so cannot be used to defend the reading here. But the context of both Jer. xiii 26 and Nah. iii 5 can be assayed in support and both contexts describe public nakedness as a humiliation for sexual transgression. Furthermore, in Hab. ii 16, the appellant is satiated (sbC) with qdlon, having made a neighbour drunk and peeped at his pudenda (me6orehem; cf. BDB, p. 735, "nakedness, pudendum"). The verb sib ("satiated) occurs, also, in a context of sexual desire in Ezek. xvi 28; cf. xvi 36, 37-8. The first line in Hab. ii 16 ("d" below) describes not (as in most translations) the beginning of punishment, but the pornographic sin which receives its measure-for-measure recompense in the last line ("d' ). a Woe to him who makes his neighbour drink, b from the goblet* of your wrath and anger to make drunk, c so to stare at their nakedness. d You are sated with lewdness instead of honour a' So you, Drink, and go uncircumcised, b' the cup in the right hand of Yahweh will come around upon you, d' [let there be] lechery on your honour. a hoy masqeh reiehu b missap hamdteka we'ap sakker c lemacan habbit Cal-mecorehem d sdbaCta qdlon mikkdbod a' ieteh gam- attd wehicarel b' tissob Caleykd kos yemin yhwh d' weqiqalon Cal-kebodeka *The emendation from mesappeah hamdteka to missap hamdteka sup- posing a dittography of the h of hamdtekd, has broad acceptance; see the list in BDB, p. 705 "sdpah", and p. 706, "sap"; It is supported, also, by the parallel structure between "a-b" and "a'-b"'. 172</page><page sequence="29">ISAIAH VI 1-5 APPENDIX 3: 'AMMOT HASSIPPIM IN ISA. VI 4 As all commentaries indicate, the meaning of 'ammot hassippim is unclear ('ammti: "otherwise 'forearm, ulna"', Wildberger, n. 28, p. 249 = German, p. 232). Though sipplm does seem to have to do with some part of a doorway, it may be that the phrase was selected more for poetic parallelism than for architectural exac- titude. Looking at the consonants alone, the complete phrase is reasonably concentric in structure: wync 'mt hspm mql hqr' whbyt yml' Csn 'l I I I' I I Of course some consonants are not counted in the scheme- concentricity is not perfect. But anyone who has tried even for a simple rhyme that says something useful must realize that a scheme such as this is nearly bound to be imperfect. The two words not obviously amenable to the scheme are marked by dotted underlines. But they are parallel conceptually and syntactically: both words refer to the physical edifice, or some part thereof; both are equally affected by the sound of the shouting, and both nouns are definite: a wayydnutu 'ammot b hassipim c miqqol c' haqqore' b' wehabayit a' yimmaleg) Csdn From the structure one might deduce that the central sounds (qol haqqore) of the seraphic calls evoke a sympathetic reaction in the temple sanctum itself. It responds in two parallel ways: shaking the "doorposts" and filling with smoke. The point of this baroque structuring device would be to mirror, in souch patterns, the man- ner in which the sound of the calling seraphim set off a harmonic vibration in the temple. 173</page></plain_text>
