<plain_text><page sequence="1">Inigo Jones and the Architecture of Poetry* by ELIZABETH T. JORDAN ARCHITECTURE IN ENGLAND REMAINED a fledgling science until InigoJones's Italianate classicism burst forth in London in the first decades of the seventeenth century. His 1622 Banqueting House at Whitehall with its masterful double-cube interior astound- ed Londoners accustomed to the rabbit warren of Elizabethan apartments making up the surrounding Whitehall Palace; its rhyth- mic, subtly articulated marble facade clashed with the eclectic ex- teriors of neighboring buildings. That Jones's innovations seemed foreign and idiosyncratic led contemporary English architects to hesitate to adopt his methods. Jones's theories and techniques were not fully assimilated until a century later. Today, as inJones's time, the full nature of his new classicism has yet to be completely re- vealed. Jones created a new synthesis, animated by both literature and architecture, which responded to antique and Italian Renais- sance prototypes and provided new and philosophically tempered aesthetic standards not only for poetry and buildings but also for English culture. Owing to Jones's accomplishments, the terms "Classicism" and "Renaissance" take on a newly integrated and en- riched significance, linking disciplines and offering provocative in- sights into the matrices of early seventeenth-century culture. Art historians have revised and are continuing to revise opinions about Jones as a wholesale importer of Italian classicism into En- gland. No longer does Jones's greatness stem from the imposition upon England of "Italian classicism directly derived from Palladio and Vitruvius";' neither did he transplant "whole buildings of purely Italian character into England. "2 NowJones's impact on En- glish thought is understood to be a complex interaction involving imitation, adaptation, and invention.3 As a working architect, Jones moved beyond the literary manifestation of architecture de- scribed both by his poetic contemporaries and by himself. His the- oretical writings become manifest in his theatrical settings for the *I am grateful for the early advice of Sir Roy Strong, John Dixon Hunt, and Ronald S.

An analysis of Jones's working methods will demonstrate the breadth of his fertile and creative mind, a mind that saw clearly the architectural spirit of the time and that flourished in England's sophisticated literary and philosophical climate. Before InigoJones's time, designers of English buildings had re- lied on illustrations and descriptions culled from source books. The eclectic style that resulted, which has been called "artisan manner- ism,"4 drew upon Flemish, Dutch, French, and Italian sources, and featured the random application of borrowed architectural ele- ments. Giant pilasters, fanciful applied stone-carving, and pictur- esque curving gable silhouettes delighted the Elizabethans and early Jacobeans who had money and prestige enough to build extrava- gant "prodigy houses."5 Masons, stonecutters, and carpenters served as designers for these buildings. While architects like Robert Smythson had overseen integrated designs for handsome English buildings,6 no one before Jones had tried to synthesize the under- lying philosophy of architectural programs in such a bold new way, avoiding eclecticism. The jarring effect of the Whitehall building at its completion in 1622 is a topic often discussed. John Harris describes its newness, for example, "as if the Seagram Building had been erected for the 1851 Crystal Palace Exposition."7 The surprise would have come earlier had Jones completed the house he began designing for Queen Anne at Greenwich in 6 6. Her death in 1619 delayed com- pletion, and construction recommenced in 1630 for Henrietta Maria, the wife of Charles I. The house, with its single cube en- trance foyer and Palladian south balcony, was not completed until I635. But even in 1622 the Banqueting House, a foreign upstart among the cluster of existing Tudor buildings, puzzled the English, accustomed as they were to the more derivative "artisan manner- ist" style. An English contemporary in 1621 described it as "too faire and nothing suitable to the rest of the house. "8 Harris suggests thatJones's subordinates, who were mostly men of lesser intellec- tual sophistication than those surrounding Sir Christopher Wren a 4Summerson, 1977, I57.

Jones "held kings, and courtiers, spellbound with his awe-inspiring re- naissance learning. There was no one in England like him and there has been no one since. He was a phenomenon, a true uomo universale. .. . With all due respect, Wren and Robert Adam pale into insignificance beside him."Io A self-taught genius, Jones was so in advance of his English contemporaries that only posterity re- mained to validate his work (fig. I). Jones left us his own documentation about how his mind dealt with architectural matters: extensive annotations in the margins of his copy of Andrea Palladio's I Quattro libri dell'architettura, carried with him on his 1613-I 5 Italian travels with the Arundels. Atten- tion focused on the indebtedness ofJones's work to that of Palladio has all but obscured the central notion that the disagreements voiced by Jones in these notes create and shape a new image and a new theory of classicism answering only to Jones himself. Jones's vigorous intellectual wrestling with issues of design attests to his largely unrecognized stature as a classical innovator. In Venice in I570 Palladio (I508-I580) published the Quattro libri, an immediate success. The four books treat the elements of ar- chitecture (engineering, proportions, foundations, columns, vaults, chimneys, stairs, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, and Tuscan or- ders, and so forth); the design of private homes, both sixteenth- century villas in or near Vicenza and also domestic dwellings in an- cient Greece and Rome; public structures such as bridges, roads, piazzas, and basilicas; and ancient Roman temples. Various English translations of the book appeared from 1663 on, most notably those published by Giacomo Leoni during the heyday of the Palladian re- vival in Burlington's time. The 1742 Leoni edition includes a tran- scription ofJones's handwritten notes. Jones's Palladio became his 9Harris, 1973, I9. '°Idem, and Strong, o0. "II use primarily an updated transcription of the marginalia, along with a facsimile edition ofJones's Palladio, InigoJones on Palladio. The date probably refers to the Venice 1601 edition. AlthoughJones may have been in Italy sometime between 1598 and 1603, he probably purchased the Palladio in Italy in 1613, at the start of his trip with the Arun- dels.

In a wider sense, Jones's Palladio serves as a stylistic basis for English architectural neoclassicism as developed later by Christopher Wren, Robert Adam, Colen Campbell, and William Kent. Jones's dynamic interpretation of Palladio is a creative example of the Renaissance doctrine of imitation. By the time this intellec- tual revolution reached England, it was capable of diverse defini- tion. Roger Ascham reduces the rich Italian ideal to a set of demar- cated rules suggesting where one should "leaveth out," "addeth," "diminisheth," or "altereth."'4 Sir Philip Sidney endorses Aristo- tle's poetic doctrine of imitation, giving it English authority, in the Apologyfor Poetry. Jones internalizes the order and methods of clas- sical construction, embodying a solution not fully understood by his contemporaries but which would serve as an inspiration for En- glishmen a century later. Reshaping the formulae of classical Rome and Renaissance Italy to fulfill new English requirements and cre- ating a new classical synthesis responding not only to his society but also to his own assured analysis and independent selectivity, he carries on a vital dialogue with antiquity. The book itself displays a spidery script of watery brown ink on thin and slightly oiled paper, through which notations on the re- verse are often visible. Its well-worn surfaces alone would make de- ciphering it difficult; Jones's original spelling and syntax compound '2As proved by dated inscriptions in it from the I63os about Italian sources for el- ements in buildings he was designing for Queen Henrietta Maria.

His "orthographe simplement phonetique,"'5 extraordi- narily personal even in an age of creative spellers and grammarians, reflects Jones's lack of formal education; he was the son of a clock- worker and later was apprenticed to a joiner before beginning a ca- reer as a "picture-maker." Such origins constituted an obstacle for advancement in the literary and courtly world to which Jones be- came attached after his appointment as Royal Surveyor underJanmes I and inspired jealousy from BenJonson, who emerged from a sim- ilarly inauspicious background. But as with Jonson, with whom Jones worked on many court masques between 1605 and 163 when the famous quarrel terminated their collaboration,'6 Jones's auto- didacticism drove him to learn with a special intensity. The books Jones collected for his personal library reveal an instinctive drive to master his insatiable intellectual interests, including those far re- moved from his immediate profession. Just as his classical mentor, Vitruvius, required architecture students to be fully grounded in all disciplines, Jones read nearly everything available, exhibiting a catholicity of taste-collecting books about mathematics, music, antiquities, biography, and moral philosophy, in addition to those about architecture and art theory.l7 Jones's kinship with the European Renaissance world helps to explain his particular brand of imitation. His theatrical designs had Italian roots (the intermezzi of the Medici courts and of the com- media dell'arte), and he introduced into England the proscenium stage, primarily derived from Baldassare Peruzzi. Jones follows Vitruvius in believing that an architect must have both natural abil- ity (ingenium) and instruction or willingness to apply himself (dis- ciplina). According to Vitruvius, a good architect "should be a man of letters, a skillful draughtsman, a mathematician, familiar with historic studies, a diligent student of philosophy, acquainted with music; not ignorant of medicine, learned in the responses of ju- 'SJones-Davies, 39.

His drawing for the proscenium arch for the 1632 masque Albion's Triumph contains two figures, Theorica and Practica, which correspond to the cluster of aesthetic ideas about the unity of the liberal and the mechanical arts put forth by Italian theorists such as Giovanni Paolo Lomazzo (1538-1600) and Vin- cenzo Scamozzi (I 52-1616). The frontispiece of Scamozzi's archi- tectural treatise, L'Idea della architettura universale (I6I5), features two allegorical figures, Theorica and Experientia, the models for Jones's masque design for Albion's Triumph. 9 Jones's notes in his books of moral philosophy, such as Xenophon, Plato's Republic, Aristotle's Ethics, Plutarch's Moralia, and Alessandro Piccolomini's Della Institutione morale (1575), indicate intense interest in the rela- tions among mathematics, music, and the visual arts. Undeniably, Jones had verifiable authority for what he did. The assumption of universality infuriated Ben Jonson, who railed at Jones for aspiring to be The maker of the Properties! In summe The Scene! the Engyne! but he now is come To be the Musick Master! Fabler too! He is, or would be the maync Dominus doe All in the Worke!20 Jonson wished to keep Jones in his subordinate place as craftsman and set designer, butJones established himself as a formidable cre- ative rival because of his broad knowledge. ForJones, architecture transcended the mechanical arts; in subsuming theory in practice, Jones agreed with the iconologist Cesare Ripa who explained that "Theory is concerned with reason and the operation of the intellect; practice with the operations and movement of the senses . . . the former contemplates highest causes, the latter investigates lowest effects. So that the one is the summit and the other the foundation of the whole fabric of human discourse."21 These beliefs made it impossible for Jones to accept a secondary position in Jonson's desired hierarchy of authority; the apparently '8Vitruvius I: 9. '9Gordon, I66-67. '2"An Expostulacion with Inigo Jones," il Bien Joiisoii, 8: 404. " Icoologia (Padua, 1625), as quoted by Gordon, 167. 286</page><page sequence="8">INIGO JONES AND THE ARCHITECTURE OF POETRY 287 petty argument over whose name should appear first on the title- pages of masques is only the most obvious indication of a deeply rooted philosophical disagreement. Jones's intellectual universality galled Jonson. In the masque Neptune's Triumph Jonson's "master Cook," whose functions parody those of an architect, is an only thinly veiled Inigo Jones: A Boyler, Range, and Dresser were the fountaines Of all the knowledge, in the Universe, And that's the Kitchen. Where, a Master-Cooke- ... is the man of men, For a Professor! He designes, he drawes, He paints, he carves, he builds, he fortifies . . . And teacheth all the tacticks at one dinner.22 BothJonson andJones, reflecting classical and Renaissance theory, insist that the proper realm of the source of art is the mind; seen from this theoretical viewpoint, the struggle between Jones and Jonson for authority makes a clash inevitable. Given the broad in- terdisciplinary scope ofJones's interests and his work, Jones has ar- guably superior claims in the debate. Jones's architectural practice articulated and reified the shared and complementary concerns of the two artists. Jones closely follows those Italian Renaissance thinkers who felt that this comprehensive knowledge was necessary for true classical creation, requiring that they become polymaths who would alter and enhance instead of copy. The extensive tradition of sixteenth- century Italian literary criticism emphasizes this necessity. In the ongoing polemic about Dante's originality as opposed to his depen- dence on Aristotelian tradition, Italian critics refer often to the ne- cessity to recreate, as well as to the interdependence of the visual and the literary arts as both strive to put forth a classical ideal. Len- zoni, for example, believes in the legitimacy of composing new genres, building on the inherited traditions of antiquity but fusing new solutions containing the principles of classical design inher- ently whether the poet consciously attempts this or not. The true creator rediscovers for himself the canons of worthiness and of pro- portions in such a way that his own new work intrinsically echoes classical standards. Lenzoni sees Dante as "observing everywhere and always so perfect and clear an order that if this were changed 22Jonson, 7: 684.</page><page sequence="9">RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY or that altered, without a doubt one would lose and spoil that beauty and grace which are represented to the eyes of our mind by its perfect and universal proportion."23 While sixteenth-century critics uphold Aristotle's Poetics as a basis for literary creation, they champion the need for altering Aristotelian ideas to fit the needs of contemporary audiences. Scrupulous observation of rules has to be tempered with changes "according to mutations in times and in re- ligions. "24 Understood in this way, imitation is the soul of architecture as well as of poetry. After Brunelleschi initiated the architectural re- turn to classical principles in the fifteenth century, in the sixteenth, others further developed classical ideas, re-implementing and re- integrating Vitruvian theories. Richly conceived contemporary Italian buildings resulted from this new fertilization. An anony- mous critic investigating the Ariosto / Tasso dispute in the later six- teenth century reinforces the idea of discovering the universal in the particular. He compares Ariosto to Michelangelo, observing that both artists use pre-existing rules and models but also fashion cre- ations exhibiting new solutions and effects.25 An appeal to reason informs both poem and building, and the specifics of structure are less important than the underlying impetus. Tasso's 1586 response to one critic reflects the attitude: "the poet must compose things in a proper way, according to necessity and according to verisimili- tude, and give them an appropriate form in the same way that the architect customarily gives it to the stones with which he builds. . . . That composition is not a poem in which form is lacking, in which things and events are not well composed together."26 The mind of the poet or architect uses imitation to reanimate Aristo- telian theory. Architects and poets came to share common artistic assump- tions, striking examples being the poetry of Ben Jonson and later of Andrew Marvell, particularly in the sub-genre of the country house poem.27 Jonson's notion of imitation is crucial to the larger question of the uses of Greek and Roman models. He says that one 23As translated by Weinberg, 2: 825. 24Anonymous author as translated by Weinberg, 2: 894-95. Orgel (I984, 56I) com- ments on Jones's "very fluid set of possibilities," as opposed to "rigid consistency." 2SAs translated by Weinberg, 2: 978-79. 26Tasso to Lombardelli, as translated by Weinberg, 2: 1030. 27For discussions of the country house poem, see Hibbard; McClung, 1977; and Wayne. 288</page><page sequence="10">INIGO JONES AND THE ARCHITECTURE OF POETRY 289 of the requisites of a poet, along with "Nature," "Exercise," "Studie," and "Art," is "Imitation," which means being able "to convert the substance, or Riches of an other Poet, to his owne use." This imitation should not be practiced indiscriminately or without selective evaluation; according toJonson we should use the ancients as "Guides, not Commanders. 28 Jonson's own use of architectural metaphor, especially in Discoveries, confirms the view of examined imitation put forth in the country house poems such as "To Pens- hurst." For Jonson, constructing a literary work was analogous to building a house: "first appoint a place to build it in . . . define[d] within certaine bounds: So in the Constitution of a Poeme, the Ac- tion is aym'd at by the Poem, which answers Place in a building ... by this definition wee conclude the fable, to be the imitation of one perfect, and intire Action; as one perfect, and intire place is requir'd to a building." 29 When George Chapman dedicates his Musaeus to Inigo Jones in 1616, he notes that poetry and architecture require "to their excellence a like creating and proportionable rapture." Evidence supports the argument that Jones's expressions of the theories of proportion predateJonson's, as Discoveries in all proba- bility dates from I62330 andJones's comments from 1613 forward. Jones has the additional advantage of embodying those theories in palpable architectural form: buildings. A review of both men's ideas about proportion and its human sources illuminates their shared concerns. In the humanist tradition he shares with Jones, Jonson naturally connects ideal proportion with the human body: "as a body without proportion cannot be goodly, no more can the Action, either in Comedy or Tragedy, without his fit bounds." A symmetrical unity must grow from "a certaine proportionable greatnesse"31 in the human body, with all parts related to the whole. Jonson's remarks follow the classical tenets set up by Vi- truvius, who states that "all studies are related to one another and have points of contact . . . for a general education is put together like one body from its members."32 For Vitruvius, proper propor- tion is achieved "as in the human body, from cubit, foot, palm, inch 28Jonson, 8: 567, 638-39. 29Ibid., 8: 645. 30Ibid., 9: 213. 3'Ibid., 8: 646. 32Vitruvius, I: 17.</page><page sequence="11">RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY and other small parts," bringing about "the symmetric quality of eurhythmy" in a building as in a human form.33 Jones knew his Vitruvius well; he penned in the margins of this section of his copy that "Eurhythmia is the temperinge of the pro- portion applied to ye matter as Equiti is tojustice. "34 The basic ratio using the height of a head from chin to crown becomes a technique creating pleasing and logical proportion. This beauty follows the definition of Leon Battista Alberti, the fifteenth-century Italian ar- chitect and author responsible for codifying the laws of visual per- spective: "a kind of harmony and concord of all parts to form a whole which is constructed according to a fixed number, and a cer- tain relation and order. "35 Mathematical precision governs much of Jones's decision-making, as evidenced by an annotated comment in his Serlio that "because Serly leaves ye height of ye rooms to ye will of ye builder it seemes he understood (not) ye true geometricall height of them. "36 In his copy of Alberti, Jones makes notes about musical ratios, comparing them to visual harmonic proportions, stating that "the same number that please the eare please the eie. "37 Jones's architectural principles are couched definitively in corporeal language, underscoring his dependence on human proportion and anthropomorphic analogy: "As in designe first on studies the parte of the boddy of man as Eyes, nose, mouths, Eares and of the rest to bee practicksed in the partes sepperat . . . and consequently a hoole ... all ornamented. ... So in Architecture on must studdy the parte[s] . . . and then adurrne them."38 While Jonson has attracted attention for his ideas about human proportion, Jones had already internalized the theory in his notes and had demonstrated it in his visible works. Penned in the margins ofJones's copy of Vitruvius is "the boddi of man well proporsioned is the patern for proportion in buildings."39 As a practicing archi- tect, Jones exercises his belief in an objective and measurable aes- thetic ideal following the vigorous logic of Alberti.

He intuits and postulates that classic organic form must be perceived by the human intellect. He relies upon intellectual evidence drawn from the common English tradition of empiricism but presses this tradition to its ultimate fulfillment, architectural construction. Jones and Jonson agree on the restraint of undue luxury just as they do on belief in human proportion. Jonson decries undue or- namentation and expense in building as well as in poetry; intem- perate extravagance is like "Statues, marble Pillars, Pictures, guil- ded Roofes, where under-neath is Lath, and Lyme; perhaps Lome."42 Jonson refers to the kind of house "built to envious show" and boasting rows of "Of polish'd pillars, or a roofe of gold" which he censures in "To Penshurst";43 his classical and eth- ical method of creation applies to architecture as well as to poetry, and he reasons analogically that beneath the marble pillars and gilded roofs there ought to be a solid foundation. While Jonson speaks figuratively about aesthetic principles in his poetry, Jones demonstrates them in his architecture. Speaking in literal terms about actual architectural monuments, Jones comments in 1614 in his sketchbook that "In all inventions of capricious ornaments, one must first design the ground, or the thing plain, as it is for use, and on that vary it, adorn it. Compose it with decorum according to the use, and the order it is of." He faults the mannerist and proto- Baroque architects who ornament their facades illogically: "And to say true all these composed ornaments the which proceed out of the 4°Qiattiro libii, i, cap. i, p. B, trans. Isaac Ware, 1738. I have modernized spelling. 4'Quoted by Toplis, 61. For relevant updating of this and preceding ideas as applied to twentieth-century architecture, see Rowe, 1976. 42Jonson, 8: 607. 43Ibid., 8: 93, 11.1, 3.</page><page sequence="13">RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY abundance of designers ... in my opinion do not well in solid Ar- chitecture and the facciate of houses." On the contrary, he cites what is appropriate in architecture: "For as outwardly every wise man carrieth a gravity in public places, where there is nothing else looked for, yet inwardly hath his imaginacy set on fire, and some- times licentiously flying out as nature herself doth oftentimes ex- travagantly, to delight, amaze us, sometimes move us to laughter, sometimes to contemplation and horror, so in architecture the out- ward ornaments ought to be solid, proportionable according to the rules, masculine and unaffected."44 For Jones, the outward facade of a public building should be restrained and noble like the public demeanor of a great man. Although the exterior might be a model of classical restraint, the interior could provide an inner richness consisting of imaginative lavishness provoking delight, amaze- ment, laughter, and contemplation; the interplay could enliven the whole. Inigo Jones develops these architectural principles, formulating the basis of his ideas as early as 1614, when during his Italian tour he comments not only in his Palladio but also in his sketchbook, while Jonson's similar statements in Discoveries appear a decade later. Jones first voices the principles of the inherent moral worth of classical design, while Jonson re-invokes noble self-restraint and modesty in "To Penshurst. "4 The two men jointly inherit and re- create the paradigms of antique and Renaissance classicism. The concept of magnificence requires the solution of an impor- tant problem: how a building could exhibit the magnificence of the owner while avoiding pretension. To resolve this conflict, writers and architects in the Renaissance had at their fingertips the notion of concordia discors. Jones's dislike of uncontrolled or superfluous el- egance has extensive classical provenance. His particular choice of the word "decorum" ("Compose it with decorum") and its praise immediately suggest a broad range of Renaissance connotations such as propriety in artistic creation, fitness to the dignity of a per- sonage or place, decency according to the circumstances or require- 44Quoted from Jones's Skctclhbook, in modernized spelling by Lees-Mille, 53. 4'Somie of Jonson's nascent architectural/proportional ideas appear in "To Pens- hurst," but this too is generally dated ca. i616, after Jones's earliest writings. 292</page><page sequence="14">INIGO JONES AND THE ARCHITECTURE OF POETRY 293 ments of the case, graceful beauty, orderliness, seriousness, and proper behavior, all deriving from classical antiquity. Talking about temperance in The French Academie, Pierre La Primaudaye praises "A waie how to frame all things according to that which is decent or seemely, which the Latines call decorum."46 In this regard, architectural magnificence always poses the par- adoxical issue of restraint. Excess is to be avoided-the gilded ceil- ings derided by Jonson and figuring in Plato's arguments against Themistocles, or the aurea laquearia which reappear as the wickedly luxurious roof of fretted gold in Milton's Pandemonium. When Horace, Virgil, and Martial all praise the values of rural retirement, they speak about dwellings responsive to the needs and scope of their owners, not about those of sophisticated urban indulgence leading to moral corruption.47 Aristotle defines magnificence as a "mode of observing the mean" which requires suitability of expen- diture; that is, while the nature of magnificence suggests a grand scale, it also requires both restrained expense and a proper object, occasion, or method: "the magnificent man's expenditure is suit- able as well as great ... consequently the objects he produces must also be great and suitable . . . the motive of the magnificent man . . will be the nobility of the action. "4 The liberality endorsed by Aristotle is directed specifically at buildings, whose construction and decoration must be in accord with the position and resources of the patron and whose tangible presence underscores the perma- nence required for true magnificence. The Italian title, "I1 Magnifico," draws directly upon the Renais- sance concept of magnificence, which permeates the courtesy books such as II Cortegiano, in which Castiglione links "liberality, magnificence, desire for honor, gentleness, pleasantness, affabil- ity. "49 Proportionate magnificence illuminates all of the arts, archi- tecture and poetry especially, most famously in Spenser's letter to Raleigh about The Faerie Queene: "So in the person of Prince Arthure I sette forth magnificence in particular which vertue, for that (according to Aristotle and the rest) it is the perfection of all 46Trans. T. Bowes, 1586, Oxford English Dictionary, i: 664. 47For a thorough treatment of these ideas, see McClung. 1983, esp. pt. 2, "Poet and Architect"; Freeman; and Rostvig. 48Aristotle, o10, 205-1 1. 49Castiglione, 303.</page><page sequence="15">RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY the rest, and conteineth in it them all."'5 For Spenser, not only is magnificence omnipresent and universally acclaimed, but it is the master virtue, including all the others. The relationship between man and building becomes preemi- nent. Jones logically emphasizes those practical architectural qual- ities revered by Alberti, who contends that art must be objective, scientific, and necessarily concerned with human actions, so that it would invoke not only pleasure but also moral contemplation. s In Alberti's mid-fifteenth-century definition, an architect is he "who, by a sure and wonderful Art and Method, is able, both with thought and invention, to devise ... those works, which . . . can with greatest Beauty be adapted to the uses of Mankind."52 Jones inherits and redefines the relationship between men and the build- ings they inhabit, as well as the relation of the beautiful, the prac- tical, and the ethical. Nobility, for Jones, lies not only in the har- monious overall balance of an inwardly rich design but in an analogous balance between need and consumption, supply and de- mand. A man's home is proportionate to his moral and material value. In "Upon Appleton House, " Marvell invokes the analogy of an- imals being "by their Denns exprest .... /The low roofd Tor- toises do dwell / In cases fit of Tortoise-shell."s3 Men, following the example of the natural world, should construct their unpreten- tious dwellings in dimensions Of that more sober Age and Mind, When larger sized Men did stoop To enter at a narrow loop; As practising, in dors so strait, To strain themselves through Heavens Gate. 4 Appropriateness and moderation become symbols of highest merit. Proportionate dimension in architecture pervades sixteenth- and seventeenth-century texts, a good example being Spenser's "house s°Spenser, I6. slWittkower, 1974, 193. S2Quoted by Jenkins, 40-41.

Because strait is the gate, and nar- row is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it" (Mt. 7: I3-I4). Like Jonson's Penshurst, modest and moral buildings contrast with those other ostentatious edifices which are "proud, ambitious heaps" about which Penshurst's admirers "May say, their lords have built, but thy lord dwells."56 Jones's ideas about form and function find acceptance ten years later in The El- ements of Architecture (1624), in which Henry Wotton writes that "The Place of every part, is to be determined by the Use." Wotton also follows Jones in defining a home in relation to its owner: "Ev- ery man's proper mansion house and home, being the theater of his hospitality, the seat of self-fruition, the comfortablest part of his own life, the noblest of his son's inheritance, a kind of private princedom; nay, to the possessors thereof an epitome of the whole world."57 Having subsumed these ideas, naturally growing from classical and Renaissance sources, Jones expresses them in words and in building design. Jonson's Penshurst, with its self-sufficient harvests, its impartial and genuine interaction between lord and tenant, and its mastery of "The mysteries of manners, armes, and arts",s8 embodies the concepts. The censures against impractical adornment voiced byJones are later popularized by Francis Bacon, who writes in his 1625 essay "Of Building": "Houses are built to live in, and not to look on; therefore let use be preferred before uni- formity, except where both may be had. Leave the goodly fabric of houses, for beauty only, to the enchanted palaces of the poets, who build them with small cost."59 Jones's practical sense about cost in private construction gains emphasis in a building intended for charitable purposes, a fact par- ticularly evident in his notation that the Convento della Carita was left unfinished because of"the great charg for on of the fathers tould mee that every Arch of the Perristillio wold Cost Ioooduc I meane "Spenser, 161. 56Jonson, 8: 96, 11. 101-02. 57Wotton, 2, and intro., lxxxii-iii. 5SJonson, 8: 96, 1. 98. 59Bacon, i i.</page><page sequence="17">RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY thorough outte the romes."6f Reasonableness of cost takes prece- dence over expansive design, to the degree that if overwhelming expense cannot be predicted before construction began, building stops midway through. While a building by its very nature must last, it reflects the whole person, a transitory being. Paradoxically, the man, his work, his thought, and his art are perpetuated by the lasting value of the structure. In order to endure, construction must build on solid foundations. With reference to another nearby villa Jones comments: "Throughout this House I did perceive no man- ner of Cracks nor Settlements; but it stands very solid and fir. .... A great Sum of Money must have been spent in building of this House."61 Jones focuses his decisions about construction within the constraints of need and human ability to pay and works within such constraints to exemplify the patron. The theme of appropriate expense appears also in Henry IV, Part II, in which Shakespeare describes accurately the state of English architectural construction at the close of the sixteenth century: When we mean to build We first survey the plot, then draw the model, And when we see the figure of the house, Then must we rate the cost of the erection, Which if we find outweighs ability, What do we then but draw anew the model In fewer offices, or ... desist To build at all? (I. iii. 41-48) As an inheritor of the Renaissance standard of material and moral magnificence, Shakespeare naturally understands the boundaries of proper expenditure. Architectural metaphors help Elizabethan and Jacobean writers solidify the idea of noble display and appropriate luxury, because they supply tangible form for poetic imagery. Jones's preeminently pragmatic mind causes him to criticize in his marginal notes decorations or arrangements that he feels are in- appropriate or non-functional in Palladio's villas. While the sixteenth-century Italian architect first considers the symmetrical harmony of plan and elevation, he augments this basic elegance with restrained decoration in the forms of balustrades, swags, stat- uary, and fenestration. In examining the villas designed by Palladio described in book 2 of I Quattro libri, Jones notes, for instance, that 6Jo1ies, 1970, 1: 25. ('Leoni, 71. 296</page><page sequence="18">INIGO JONES AND THE ARCHITECTURE OF POETRY 297 if planterboxes by windows were constructed out of stucco, "so much Stucco on the out-side does not well. "62 Other Palladian mo- tifs that Jones dislikes for functional reasons include the placement of"Cellares and other Magazines" underground,'3 and "staires . . . not so well placed as ye might (be) searving but for ye upper most and lowermost romes."64 Such comments enlphasize Jones's de- pendence on Alberti's idea that art must align itself with human ac- tions, an idea echoed in England in the poetry of Ben Jonson. In "To Penshurst," Jonson sees the close relationship between a building and its owner, implying that the special effect Penshurst has upon the public reflects a human being whose moral values co- incide with those of the building, on whose garden walls hang "The blushing apricot, and woolly peach/. . . that every child may reach." Penshurst's walls are egalitarian, "rear'd with no mans ru- ine, no mans grone. "65 Like the house, its inhabitants observe eth- ical propriety; Penshurst's lady, always prepared to welcome un- expected guests and to share liberal provisions freely with servants as well as distinguished visitors, is "noble, fruitful, chaste withall," and teaches her children "to pray, / With the whole household."66 The lord and lady of Penshurst, along with their echoing domicile itself, set standards of chastity, integrity, decorum, compassion and equality. Jonson uses personification in addressing the house- "thou would'st feast," "Thou joy'st," "thou art faire"67-making it a metaphor for deep-rooted humanistic beliefs.68 He emphasizes that Penshurst's growth was natural and organic, so that a revered "ancient pile" was gradually created which became a humanized, responsive artifact through the accumulation of personal history. The theoretical underpinnings of this human and moral pragma- tism are evident in Inigo Jones's notes and buildings. Andrew Marvell's poem "Upon Appleton House, to my lord Faiifax" is a signal example of mid-seventeenth-century English re- flections ofJones's new morality and new classicism. Jones's insis- tence upon using human proportion as a guide for measuring the harmony between building and owner is everywhere present in the 62Ibid. 63Ibid., 72. 64Jones, 1970, 1:27. 65Jonson, 8: 94, 11. 43-46. 66Ibid., 8: 96, 11.90, 95-96. 67Ibid., 8: 93, 11. 21, 7-8. 6SSee Hart.</page><page sequence="19">RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY poem. The chronology of the house's construction and successive adaptations is uncertain,69 and attempts at definitive architectural identification are made even more difficult by Marvell's delight in metaphorical language, but the poetic/architectural analogies are valid. In Appleton House "bodies measure out their place. "70 Mar- vell praises it as a "sober Frame," the "Work of no Forrain Architect; /.. Whose Columnes should so high be rais'd / To arch the Brows that on them gaz'd."7' He acclaims Nun Appleton for its humility and its lack of architectural pretensions: Humility alone designs Those short but admirable Lines By which, ungirt and unconstrain'd, Things greater are in less contain'd.72 Practicality reigns here, "Where ev'ry Thing does answer Use,"73 and Fairfax himself seems to activate the architectural environment as well as the ethical one; when he enters "the swelling Hall / Stirs, and the Square grows Spherical."74 Whether or not a domed cupola actually existed at the time Marvell described the house, the alle- gorical conceit is clear: Fairfax as owner and dweller was the en- ergizing and organizing force behind the building itself. In accordance with Renaissance concepts of munificence, Mar- vell portrays Fairfax as giving liberally and benevolently: A Stately Fronitispice of Poor Adorns without the open Door: Nor less the Rooms within commends Daily new Furniture of Friends.75 The modest proportions of Fairfax's home and the Christian char- ity that it shelters follow closely the standards reintegrated from New Testament sources by Renaissance writers like Spenser and Jonson and set down in words and in stone by Inigo Jones. The owner, who envisions his own home as more perfect than the less orderly larger "World; / But a rude heap together hurl'd," reflects 69For a summary of the arguments about the dating of Appleton House, see Mc- Clung, 1979. 70Marvell, 59, 1. i6. 7'Ibid., 59, 11. i-2, 7-8. 72Ibid., 60, 11. 41-44. 73Ibid., 6o, 1. 62. 74Ibid., 60, 11. 51-52. 7 Ibid., 61, 11. 65-68. 298</page><page sequence="20">INIGO JONES AND THE ARCHITECTURE OF POETRY 299 the constellation of ideas projected by the house. Because of wise and generous human direction Nun Appleton becomes a perfected microcosm of that greater creation; it is a "lesser World .. . / But in more decent Order tame; / . . . Heaven's Center, Nature's Lap. / And Paradice's only Map."76 The celestial analogy is a fitting con- clusion to the symbolic image of the narrow door through which only the most righteous might enter heaven. Jones's shaping ideas inform not only poetry but also the court masques, which, like Jonson's Penshurst and Marvell's Nun Ap- pleton, reflect classical ideas from Greece and Rome. 77 The Jonso- nian masque as staged by Jones displays the same axial symmetry, concentric circles, and regulated vistas as classical and Renaissance building and garden plans. The framed proscenium stage creates an architectural microcosm through which spectators view deepening prospects painted on wings at varying distances. Jones's invention of the machina versatilis, a sort of revolving globe with no visible axle, lets him display at least two successive scenes of one stage set- ting; his invention, too, is the scena ductilis, an arrangement of mov- able shutters set in grooves. Jones adopts the periaktoi, of Greek der- ivation and praised by Vitruvius-triangular prisms rotating to change whole scenes. One-point perspective, a focal element in Re- naissance architecture and gardens, often appears in the masques to emphasize one point of view for the primary spectator, the king. Perspective, mathematical proportion, and exactness of classical derivation energizeJones's stage sets as they do his theories and his buildings. In Chloridia, Jonson's last masque at court (1631), architecture occupies an abstract role. The presentation of four characters rep- resenting "Poesie, History, Architecture, and Sculpture,"78 spot- lights architecture and poetry as part of a larger family of mutually assisting pursuits. Jones considers the unification of architecture and poetry, like that of theory and practice exemplified in the stage set for Albion's Triumph, essential for an understanding of Roman architectural glories as translated into English Renaissance vernac- ular. 76Ibid., 82, 11. 761-62, 765-68. 77For a thorough treatment of Jones/Jonson masques, see Orgel, 1965; idem and Strong, 1973; Lindley; Nicoll; Reyher; and Welsford. 78Jonson, 7: 758-59.</page><page sequence="21">RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY The frequent use of architectural settings, language, and charac- terizations occurring in the masques and the entertainments ani- mates Jones's theory. The mimetic nature of the masques encour- ages parallels between architecture and poetry; both visible buildings and their theatrical representations are "mirrors of mans life," asJonson says, in Loves Triumph through Callipolis, that public spectacles ought to be. 79 Similarly, the use of architectural imagery in poetry, a borrowing between disciplines, implies an imitation of method. The mutual collaboration of architecture and poetry in- forms the larger issue of the transmission of classicism. The transference of ideas of imitation, decorum, and magnifi- cence from Italy across the channel can largely be ascribed to Jones. Rank confers responsibility on landowners to govern wisely and benevolently with proper attention to expense, humility, and be- nevolence. These notions indicate the direction of the restructuring of the classical idiom after its migration from Italy. The receptive English moral climate provided a happy ambience for controlled but innovative architecture. The shaping elegance of design, dec- oration, and owner's inner worth in the country house poems par- allels the rational, measured elegance of Palladian style. WhileJon- son and Marvell reshape an arcadian, georgic ideal into practical and moral terms, Jones's original creative vision allows him to analyze the forms and interconnections of classical design. Jones's marginal analytical comments in his Palladio give breadth to the true extent of his aesthetic and theoretical creativity. Inas- much as tutoring Arundel was a relaxed exercise, not requiring continuous attention, Jones was often free in Italy between I613 and I615 to follow his own artistic, critical, and analytical pursuits. Be- cause of his fascination with detailed inquiry, he visited, viewed, measured, and evaluated both ancient and more recent architectural monuments and Palladian buildings. Jones's intellectual curiosity leads him to question whether Palladio's descriptions, drawings, and measurements are correct and justifiable. To account for evi- dent discrepancies, Jones compares Palladio's words and sketches with his own observations, measurements, and descriptions, and analyzes divergent findings. Jones wants to judge, for example, 79Ibid., 7: 735. 300</page><page sequence="22">INIGO JONES AND THE ARCHITECTURE OF POETRY 301 whether or not Palladio's formulae for the most aesthetically pleas- ing proportions-for columns, balconies, staircases, fenestration- succeed visually. In book one Palladio describes the use and design of the five ar- chitectural orders-Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, and Composite-suggesting appropriate functions and dimensions for each. He lists and diagrams the dimensions and arrangement of the Ionic order (ch. 16), including its base according to Vitruvius, made up of one convex molding (torus) topping two concave moldings (scotiae). But observing that in many Greek and Roman buildings a different base (the Attic) was used with the Ionic column, Palladio postulates a more visually pleasing scheme of concave/convex/ concave moldings, although "at the same time I have not omitted the design of that order'd by Vitruvius." Jones agrees with Palla- dio's aesthetic judgment here, commenting in the margins that "Vitruvious his Ionick baace: not goode." Palladio's divergences of this sort prompt Jones's careful observation: "Palladio somwhat varries from Vittuuius [sic] allowing ye members and making them a litell bigger."80 Jones focuses on Palladio, and understands thoroughly the build- ings and the architectural treatises of other sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Italians who were both architects and writers, such as Sebastiano Serlio (1475-1552), Giacomo Barozzi da Vi- gnola (1507-1573), and Vincenzo Scamozzi.81 He has absorbed the theories of Alberti and Vitruvius, whose ideas he often plays against those of Palladio and others in order to provide a synthesis for re- valuation: "He meanes from the side of ye square of ye Abacco ... and not as Viniola hath it but his of Palladio is to littell saile . . . betwen them boath Scamozio is ye best which is To make a circle of on diamiter and threequarters and the line to tuch ye astragall and the said line as I have yoused and it doeth well. "82Jones's comments about the proportional structure of a capital, from the abacus (the square piece topping a capital) to the astragal (a circular molding directly above a column) not only reveal his knowledge of existing solutions but also his conscious choice of that which is to him the 8°Jones, I970, I: 7. 8'Serlio published his six books of architecture (Tutte I'opere d'architettura et prospet- tiva) between 1537 and 1551, with an English translation (The Book of Architecture) ap- pearing in i161. Vignola published the Regola delli cinqte ordini d'architettura in 1562. 8Jones, I970, I: I0.</page><page sequence="23">RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY more pleasing and also the more efficacious design-in this case, Scamozzi's, as verified by Jones's own practical experience. While explaining how Palladio's design differs from that of Vignola, Jones tests both Palladio and Vignola against his own standards of con- struction, later siding with Scamozzi. His reason for agreeing with Scamozzi is personal and functional: "I have yoused it and it doeth well." Jones notes with reverence that on Friday, I August 1614, he spoke with Scamozzi, a man of sixty-two, the only one of the great Italian Renaissance theorists still alive. While Jones is properly re- spectful to the Italian authority, he submits Scamozzi's designs to rigorous examination, revealing his own comprehension of under- lying principles. Jones notes in a section of Palladio (book one) deal- ing with architectural cornices the fact that the Greeks and Romans sometimes use perspectival recession in a way Scamozzi does not understand. He comments that the ancients occasionally enlarge parts farther from human eyes, making them appear in scale, and "Of this Secret, Scamozzi has been purblind, and understood it not. "83 Jones states that Scamozzi chides Palladio "for this Cornice wrongfully," noting that Palladio does take into account the visual effect of architectural members when seen from a distance. Jones's touching upon a vital Renaissance concept internalizes its logic: per- spective affects a thing's appearance and must be taken into account in architectural design by proper sizing and positioning. His prac- tical turn of mind leads him to examine in detail the extent to which theory needs to be modified by realistic demand. The outwardly harmonious balance ofJones's architectural elements masks a tense equilibrium between sensation and order. Jones's work avoids pre- dictability and repetitiveness in classical design because he creates a counterpoise of ordered facade and lively exchange between building and viewer, bringing about a taut interplay informing the whole. Jones's practicality and attention to detail lead him to call atten- tion to what he sees as obvious errors in Palladio: "I do find the numbers within the prick'd Line, to be false; for there is in the upper part of the Cornice set down 19 parts and a half, whereof I can find no more than 17 and a quarter. "84 By measuring exactly, he is able 83Leoni, 39. 84Ibid. 302</page><page sequence="24">INIGO JONES AND THE ARCHITECTURE OF POETRY 303 to find indisputable variations or alterations between Palladio and Vitruvius and between Palladio and evidence from extant build- ings. Other observers' misidentifications seem obvious to him: "This chapell must needs be anticke for it accompaneth the chief enterance and I wonder there shou[ld] bee any doubt made of it."8s At times when he is certain of surpassing Palladio in precision and in thoroughness, he stresses the date for emphasis: "This Tempell I Observed exactly ye last of Maye 1614 and have noated what I found more then is in Palladio."86 Jones's comments prove a compelling need to update, tighten, adjust, and correct-as well as translate- Palladio's descriptions. Using architectural formulae in a creative way to obtain aesthetic effects, he continually rethinks and reshapes existing criteria to meet evolving needs, refining and clarifying the eventual result. His sharp awareness of the limited scope of purely mathematical deci- sions colors his statements, such as those in his Vitruvius, that "Vi- truvius might as well prefer the grammarian to the philosopher as the mathematician to the architect. "87Jones refuses to submit to nu- merically reducible copying, choosing rather an approach toward architectural design based on logical methods of testing by mea- surement as well as by reliance on a visual aesthetic; as such, his methods embody Renaissance ideas of imitation. Jones knows that personal aesthetic and artistic judgments provide overriding evi- dence requiring modification of Greek and Roman models, and he praises such choices when he recognizes them in Palladio: "In my opinion, Palladio imitated the best Basement of the Antiquity, as in the Temples of Pola, of Nerva, of Fortuna, and of Scifi; for always the Liberty of composing with Reason is allow'd, and who follows the best of the Ancients cannot miss. "88 Jones's emphasis upon the best demonstrates that intelligent choice is a dominant criterion. Two things are crucial: personal aesthetic choices can and should be made among existing classical buildings, and human logic must govern design decisions. Jones's ideas reinvigorate classic design and constitute a disciplined and muscular artistic vision obviating the more common perception of classical principles as derivative and repetitive. 5SJones, 1970, I: 56. 16Ibid., I: 57. 87Quoted by Lees-Milne, 54. 88Leoni, 51.</page><page sequence="25">RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY Jones demonstrates the impressive force of his critical ability in his comments about Palladio's observations concerning the sixteenth-century staircase at Chambord in France. Much of Pal- ladio's praise for the spiral construction rests on its four staircases and four entrances, butJones is skeptical of Palladio's accuracy be- cause neither Palladio's diagram nor his words agree with what Jones records from observation: "The staires at Shambourge I saw being in Fraunce, and they ar but 2 wayes to ascend . . . this yt seams was discoursed to Palladio and he Invented of him sealf the staires."89 Inherent in Jones's method are a skepticism toward dogma, a healthy regard for analysis, and a need to weigh one's own findings against observable evidence. His sincere and deep admiration for the learning and the accomplishments of Palladio, Scamozzi, and the ancients impels him to submit their buildings and their words to energetic scrutiny and interpretation. He balances his concern about precise detail and verifiable facts with a sensitive receptivity to new and more pleasing aesthetic syntheses, regenerating classi- cism and rescuing it from any aesthetic paralysis. The procedure of consulting previous evidence, both written and structural, reveals a refusal to accept prior judgments without question, while at the same time also revealing a respectful regard for carefully considered past resolutions. The goal of such deliberations is the refinement of that which is both functional and aesthetically pleasing, imbuing the whole process with the moral resonance of human perfection. With Vitruvian ideas about proportion according to human fig- ures as a basis for thought, Jones the architect seeks harmony and concord in the finite form of a building. Renaissance principles of mathematics, architecture, and poetry require harmony, and grow from a heritage beginning with Pythagoras and expanded by Plato, Vitruvius, Plotinus, Augustine, and Ficino. These Neoplatonic be- liefs embody the cardinal Renaissance concept of the world's har- mony as a reflection of divine mathematical perfection.o9 Similarly, Renaissance poets are highly conscious of numerical values because of the nature of their craft. When these mathematical concepts per- 8gJones, 1970, I: I7. 9°Vitruvius specifically mentions musical harmnonies as important for architecture, as does Jones in his notes in his Alberti: "the same number that please the eare please the eie" (quoted by Toplis, 62). For further discussion of Renaissance harmony as re- lated to architecture, see Scott; and Wittkower, [953, 83-90, and I971. 304</page><page sequence="26">INIGO JONES AND THE ARCHITECTURE OF POETRY 305 meate human analogies, John Donne can "build in sonnets pretty roomes,"'9 and George Herbert can write "What house more stately hath there been, / Or can be, than is man?"92 Jones appears to carry on written conversations with Scamozzi and Palladio about matters of mathematical measurement, "From hence Scamotzio took the proportions of cornicementes in roofs and so he did in most of the things he did mesureing thes thinges Palla writt not he maad rules fer them. "93 Under this confusing syn- tax Jones is implying that Scamozzi is more precise than Palladio in the recording of mathematical measuring. If Scamozzi finds a Palladian design unaccompanied by a rule explaining it, he uses the existing ratios as measured in Palladio's drawings and from these proportions puts together his own set of rules to govern other in- dividual architectural situations. Compiling an adaptable set of ap- plicable patterns and standards that might be transferred to new de- signs in innovative ways, Jones follow Greek methods of aesthetic construction. By universalizing particulars, the classicist, whether ancient or Renaissance, examines previous statues or buildings in order to de- termine which characteristics about them are the most noble and inexhaustible and thus have inherent validity for new composi- tions-a strategy quite different from copying. The sculptor or ar- chitect might then observe, appreciate, measure, calculate, and in- tegrate the most pleasing ratios, contours, and combinations in order to create a synthesis new and aesthetically vibrant while still ordered and intellectually demanding. The resulting new standard of perfection, achieved inductively rather than deductively, grows logically and organically according to rigorous and discriminating internal laws. As classicism requires moderation, so the Renais- sance concept of magnificence requires that grandeur be propor- tionate to the stature and abilities of the owner or creator in order that exorbitant cost and ornament be avoided and the whole shaped by reasonable expenditure and functional design. Jones isolates and then recombines ideal architectural features: columns, architraves, archways, loggias, plinths, pediments. These parts have logical relationships to each other within the whole of which they are a part, and they also reflect correspon- 9'"The Canonization," 1. 32, in Donne, 98. 92"Man," 11. 4-5, in Herbert, 90. 93Jones, 1970, I: 24.</page><page sequence="27">RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY dences among media. In the seventeenth century, a network of po- etic correspondences creates a world of metaphors and universal analogies. In this system, a column might suggest a human torso and an architrave a human head or shoulders. As in the human body, the individual architectural parts create a new logical design having a greater harmony than that of any individual section. The ongoing search for the most pleasing and the most harmonious ar- rangement of parts is both scientific and aesthetic, honoring rules of mathematical construction while simultaneously pursuing har- mony of parts and final effect. Jones's rigorous demand for certainty leads him to chide Palladio for putting forth as his own design an idea coming from Giulio Ro- mano or Scamozzi, "this Enterance is to be Imitated and is ofJulio Romano . . . it Palladio setes it downe as hs owne." Scamozzi comes under this criticism too: "the third order is less than the sec- ond order of I /6 parte. All thes observationes Scamotzio, da braga- dotio: makes his owne."94 No authoritative architect escapes Jones's attention, and he is quick to point out an over-inflated self- esteem that unduly claims originality. The greatest architectural achievers of the past are precisely those whose work Jones most carefully scrutinizes, because their own magnificent creations are themselves the products of scrupulous and conscientious revalua- tion. Jones knows the creative value of reviewing carefully the devel- oping arguments of architects as a means of sharpening insight and focus: "Scamozzi utterly dislikes this desine of Palladio . . . and Vittruvius saith-that in privat buildings it is lauful to taake ye designe of any Partes of Publick buildings with moderation . .. for youse and decorum. Scamozo makes ye kycchen in ye back part of the house and in Cortill nether wch is most against the text of Vi: Alluding more to an Epistel of Plinny than other. "9 According to Jones, both Scamozzi and Palladio argue with Vitruvius about the degree to which private buildings should borrow design features of public buildings, even though Scamozzi and Palladio differ. Rely- ing on his watchwords "use" and "decorum," Jones knows that Scamozzi's placement of a kitchen does not contradict Vitruvius' recommendations as it appears to on the surface, because Jones 94Ibid., I: 22, 32. 95Ibid., 1: 31. 306</page><page sequence="28">INIGO JONES AND THE ARCHITECTURE OF POETRY 307 knows the origin of the idea to be in Pliny's letters rather than in Vitruvius. Jones's comments deal with questions of relative influ- ence-to what degree Scamozzi builds upon Palladio, or how far either one of them deviates from the original prescriptions of Vi- truvius. Jones searches out and identifies the individual initiators of creative ideas so that he can properly judge and reshape concepts in his own inquisitive mind. The search itself, which requires in- dividual choices and regulates human acts of deletion, magnifica- tion, or ordering, takes on personal and ethical significance. Sometimes Jones tries to determine the original function of a structure evidently wrongly designated, as "Sum thinke this to bee a Basillica That opinion false This was a Templle as Paladio thought but I hould it to have binn a sepulker ... by the Form and Order, so to set in it many Statues of some great Family, and being of Bricks, and having no Windows, as many of the Sepulchres were. This is not any of the Aspects describ'd by Vitruvius. "96 HereJones expands upon Palladio in developing a more specific functional identification based on structural evidence. He wants to know how buildings were used in daily life by men and women of the past. A building, to Jones, cannot be considered separately from its in- habitants as some sort of objective, distanced construction, but is erected, like Ben Jonson's Penshurst, to meet human needs. Jones corrects Palladio's mythological errors as well. He chal- lenges the identification of a building by Palladio as a Temple of Neptune by remarking "This is not likly for to Neptune being a robustious god the[y] made dorrik tempels and not corrinthian."97 He here enlists aesthetic judgments to support structural hypoth- eses. Like the Roman architects of the Colosseum who placed Doric columns on the first level, Ionic on the second, and Corinthian on the third, giving the building a sense of increasing lightness toward the upper storeys, Jones makes intellectual connections between ar- tistic styles and human characteristics. Vitruvius acknowledges that the characteristics of the various orders should be aligned with ap- propriate types of buildings, butJones carries these ideas further in order to align certain mythological identities with architectural styles. His challenge to Palladio's Neptune identification is based upon empirical evidence, the Baconian method of the seventeenth 96Ibid., I: 40. Also Leoni, 46. 97Ibid., I: 66.</page><page sequence="29">RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY century used byJones and by other English and continental Renais- sance thinkers. Jones observes that "Thes ar not tridentes but flour- ers and . . . dolfins. . . . Thes dolfins and tridentes make Paladio beleive that this Templ was deddicated to Neptun, but dorike tem- pels wear made to Neptune. "98Jones, habitually using architectural evidence as definitive, argues from it (here, the Doric capitals), while Palladio argues from the iconographical evidence of the dol- phins. Correct identification of the deities to whom Roman temples were consecrated is important for practical as well as humanistic reasons. The precise attribution of certain accessories to certain gods or goddesses, for instance, allows Jones to identify sculptural fragments returned to England by Arundel.99 A noteJones adds to his Palladio in 1633 after returning to England specifies that the piece of Roman architrave then at Arundel House in all likelihood comes from the Temple of Minerva at Smyrna because of the gor- gons' heads taking the place of triglyphs in the frieze. The substi- tution of the gorgons' heads is "a rare invention and to bee imitated sheauing how the Ansientes varied and composed their o[r]ders ac- cording to the nateurres of the gods to whome ye Tempels weare dedicated."'oo Like the Greeks and Romans, Jones exercises selec- tive aesthetic choice in architectural imitation and modification; he admires their artistic sense of correspondence and shares their ap- proval of appropriate relationships between building and function. Jones rightly sees the creativity of ancient sculptors and architects as dynamic rather than static, realizing that their stylistic choices were flexible depending on the effect desired and on the status of the building. The essence of true creativity, as Jones writes with conviction in his sketchbook, is that despite dependence upon an- tique prototypes, the liberty of composing with reason is allowed. 10 This liberty is essential to Jones the humanist, because in order to strive for perfection he needs not only Greek and Roman classical models but also his own human reason and his own personal free- dom to make choices. As Jones notes, "to varry is good but not to 98Ibid. 99For further information aboutJones, Arundel, and the importation of classical stat- uary into England, see Peacock, I986.

The creative interpretation in Jones's mind of the working hy- potheses of the classical designer is all the more striking when we realize that such notions were being supplanted in Italy at the time. The leading Italian architect in the early seventeenth century was Carlo Maderno, whose facade of Santa Susanna with its curving volutes was patterned after Giacomo della Porta's facade of I1 Gesu. Classical design was out of fashion by at least half a century; Bra- mante's and Michelangelo's classicism had given way to Manner- ism and to the emerging Baroque with its play of light and shadow and convex and concave, and its massing of giant forms for effects of drama, power, and movement. Inigo Jones resists such stylistic intrusions in Rome. He refrains from remarking about the major building projects underway cur- rently at St. Peter's, commenting instead on the century-old Tem- pietto at San Pietro in Montorio designed in 1502 by Donato Bra- mante. The tiny circular Tempietto directly and simply recalls classical design, with a three-step platform, a severe Doric order for its outside colonnade, and a single dome topping the upper enta- blature. The building has a pervasive monunlentality despite its small size, and Jones obviously appreciates its embryonic impor- tance: "In the Year 1614, being at Rome, I observed this Temple very often, and that Bramante has made no counter Pilasters into the Wall of the Cell, but only of Quadrature, he might then have made the Door bigger, and not have broke the Order of the Pilasters. "104 While admiring the classical achievements of Bramante, Jones sug- gests improvements. He comments on elements borrowed from antiquity by sixteenth-century architects like Giulio Romano ("This Invention where the Entrance opens into the Portico, Julio Romano used it in the Palace of del Conte Ottavio de Thieni lib. 2 Plate 9")o105 but he has little or nothing positive to say about contempo- rary Italian architecture. He notes unfavorably that both Serlio and '02As quoted in Harris, Orgel, and Strong, 65. '03Leoni, 5 . '°4Ibid., 48. '°5Ibid., 50.</page><page sequence="31">RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY Scamozzi incorrectly made moldings too high, thus forming afaccia (horizontal section just below the frieze) unnecessarily double, and adds, "This Error Fontana has committed also, and most of the Ro- man modern Architects."'06 Jones, disliking styles deviating from the harmonious classical norm, has a clear vision of what architects ought to do. By categorizing and collating the types and frequencies ofJones's marginal comments we learn much both about the nature of clas- sical ideas themselves and about their transmission, evolution, transformation, and assimilation. In the annotated Palladio, about half the two hundred marginal notes are primarily explicatory and descriptive, a fourth comment in a corrective fashion, and the re- maining fourth include some form of addition or correction as well as explanatory material. At least half ofJones's additions singularly revise Palladian ideas. This fact demonstrates that Jones intellectu- ally grapples with past achievements and standards in an active and querying way rather than passively transmitting outdated beliefs. Jones works imaginatively, examining critically all past accepted formulae. If in one sense the Queen's House at Greenwich is "the first Italian villa in England,"'17 the more subtle and accurate truth is that it is neither completely Italian nor copied directly from the Italian. Jones's dialogue with Palladio gives supreme evidence of this intellectual conversation. His method, far from imitation, in- volves the same innate tests and proofs upon which all classicism ultimately depends. Jones's Palladio is an intrinsically human doc- ument graphically displaying an active mind at work unfettered by fixed rules. The true value ofJones's creativity is not realized until the eigh- teenth century, when Pope's and Burlington's articulate neoclassi- cism governs English thinking. Although Jones's extant architec- tural oeuvre is incomplete, we have designs and remnants illustrating the range of his architectural creativity. Some of his ma- jor works exist only in plans, like his 1617 design for a new Star Chamber or his 1638 design for Whitehall Palace. Some have dis- appeared, like the modernized portico of St. Paul's Cathedral, de- 'i Ibid.

Others exist, but have undergone alterations in scope and proportion, like the Tuscan church and piazza in Covent Garden or the Queen's House at Greenwich. Taken together, these plans, former buildings, and modified buildings serve as palimp- sests of Inigo Jones's creative imagination. The example of the Covent Garden church reinforcesJones's po- sition. The Protestant church of St. Paul and its adjoining piazza in Covent Garden were designed byJones in 1630 and 163 I for the earl of Bedford, whose home and garden were to abut one side of the piazza (figs. 2, 3). The church now lacks much of its original power because of extensive restorations after a 1795 fire and because the ground level of the market square has been raised, covering the original plinth and the steps and altering the proportions of the fa- cade. The surrounding constructions, including two adjacent gate- ways and a series of arcaded buildings facing the piazza, have either disappeared altogether or been rebuilt beyond recognition. The dis- tinctive and daring design for the entire urban complex and for the simple masculine church itself is remarkable. Bedford told Jones he wanted a small church for the Covent Garden parishioners but that the expense must be minimal. As reported by Speaker Onslow, the conversation between Bedford and Jones was as follows: " 'In short,' said he, 'I would not have it much better than a barn. ''Well! then,' said Jones, 'You shall have the handsomest barn in En- gland.' "108 As was fitting for the simplicity of Protestant belief, as this was the first new church built in London since the Reforma- tion, Jones draws upon the most basic and primitive of antique or- ders, the Tuscan. 109 The idea of a symmetrical piazza with a tall por- ticoed church placed on the principal geometric axis was new to England, althoughJones undoubtedly knew European precedents, most notably at Livorno, where since the late sixteenth century an ambitious project for Ferdinando Medici had been underway. Even more astonishing is the choice of the Tuscan temple front, adapted from Vitruvius and Serlio, with its columns and piers and its deeply overhanging eaves. Treated by most architectural theo- rists as a primitive precursor of Doric, the Tuscan order lacks favor '°8Summerson, 1983, 87.

Alberti doesn't even mention it; Serlio speaks of it slightingly; and Palladio relegates it to rural buildings. But even as early as 16I5, Jones expresses interest in the tough and severe simplicity of Tuscan design, choosing it, based on Scamozzi's drawings, for his plans for the never-executed brew- ery and stable at Newmarket, anticipating the prince's lodgings there. For the Covent Garden church, a monument to the laiciza- tion of Anglican thinking, the Tuscan was an inspired choice. It is, in Summerson's words, a unique archaeological essay and "at the same time prophetic . .. of the theory and practice of neo- Classicism," '' and Jones sees it as directly linked to natural ideas of building. WhileJones's Covent Garden portico is derived from Scamozzi's prototype in L'Idea della architettura universale (fig. 4), his completed design characteristically displays evolution and adaptation from its predecessor. The differences occur primarily in proportion and in spacing. Jones creates a broader space between the middle two col- umns than does Scamozzi, adding horizontal stability to the whole; and he demands taller, more slender columns, adding vertical su- premacy through structural planning rather than through the height of the supporting plinth, which he lowers from Scamozzi's diagrams (fig. 5). For the startling seventeenth-century use of free- standing columns in a post and lintel system, Jones may invoke the Tempietto of Bramante, the Villa Maser of Palladio, or Michelan- gelo's proposal for a double portico of free-standing columns for St. Peter's in Rome; but his ultimate design is uniquely English while also revitalizing a primitive past. The masculine and rustic strength of the basic design must have appealed toJones, whose ear- lier erroneous speculations about a possible Roman ancestry for Stonehenge suggest a need to connect with a pragmatic and pow- erful past. Jones's use of an adapted Tuscan temple front for the simple rectangular double-cubed church in Covent Garden high- lights the general need to translate Italian classicism into English vernacular. He succeeds in creating "a completely new model as- sociating a vocabulary based on the antique into an entirely modern synthesis. "' I"Sunmmerson, 1983, 88.

Jones prefigures Pope's insights. Pope's poem addresses the issues of vain expense and the abuses of taste, specifically in architecture and gar- dening, "where all must be adapted to the Genius and Use of the Place. 'I 12 Pope realizes that greatness consists not in size or dimen- sion, but instead in the "Proportion and Harmony of the whole. '1 3 In praising Burlington because of his interest in classical arachitec- ture in general and Palladio in particular, Pope recognizes and in- vokes Jones as the instigator of true classical design in England. Pope recognizes the intellectual and ethical basis ofJones's stress on balance and proportion in human affairs as well as in architectural design, so he encourages Burlington to "Erect new wonders, and the old repair, /Jones and Palladio to themselves restore, / And be whate'er Vitruvius was before. "I4 After suffering the vicissitudes of time and taste, Jones appears here as a vital artistic force and a model for creative imitation. The refurbishing ofJones's reputation and the reexamination of the scope of his genius begun by Pope and furthered by Burlington in the eighteenth century continue. Inigo Jones and his Italian inspiration created something glorious in En- gland, something now part of our collective aesthetic conscious- ness. The shaping force of his monumental imagination has trans- lated his words into eloquent stone.
