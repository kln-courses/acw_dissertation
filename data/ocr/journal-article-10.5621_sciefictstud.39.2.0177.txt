<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> ALIEN INFESTATION AND THE POETICS OF SUBJECTIVITY 177 Elana Gomel Posthuman Voices: Alien Infestation and the Poetics of Subjectivity The Ontology of Paranoia. Imagine that one day you wake up to discover your nearest and dearest supplanted by perfect copies. The copies are physically indistinguishable from the originals but also profoundly alien, harboring unfathomable and hostile minds. This is not a layman’s definition of paranoia but a well-known sf trope, found in such classics of the genre as Robert A. Heinlein’s The Puppet Masters (1951), Jack Finney’s The Body Snatchers (1954), John Christopher’s The Possessors (1965), and many others. This trope structures texts as a narrative of transformation in which a human subject mutates into an emotional and psychological alien. Thus it poses significant theoretical questions about narrative representation of subjectivity. Narrative voice, focalization, and plot are the standard tools whereby the human subject is inscribed in narrative. Can these tools cope with an alien subjectivity located in a human body—that is, lacking the external, corporeal signs by which non-humans are so often marked in sf? And if they fail, what does this failure tell us about the literary ontology of the human subject?  I answer these questions through analysis of several representative texts of alien infestation. These texts are both chronologically and artistically diverse: John Campbell’s “Who Goes There?” (1938), Heinlein’s The Puppet Masters,  Jerry Jay Carroll’s Inhuman Beings (1998), and Scott Sigler’s Infected (2006) and Contagious (2008). I make no historical claims regarding the development of the sf canon or the evolution of the trope of alien infestation itself. Rather, my focus is specifically on its narratological implications and for this reason my choice of texts is determined by the ways in which they illustrate different facets of the dilemma outlined above: how (and whether) a narrative can represent an inhuman subjectivity contiguous with the human.1 Alien infestation literalizes Jean-François Lyotard’s famous query: “what if human beings, in humanism’s sense of the word, were in the process of, constrained into, becoming inhuman?” (2). This query has both an ontological and an ideological aspect. Humanism for Lyotard, as for Michel Foucault, implies a particular discursive (and thus narrative) construction of subjectivity. The “inhuman” is a site of rebellion against what Foucault in The Order of Things describes as the “chimeras of the new humanisms” (xxiii). In Foucault’s well-known formulation:  man—the study of whom is supposed by the naïve to be the oldest investigation since Socrates—is probably no more than a kind of rift in the order of things, or, in any case, a configuration whose outlines are determined by the new position he has so recently taken up in the field of knowledge.... [M]an is only a recent invention, a figure not yet two centuries old, a wrinkle in our knowledge, and </page> <page sequence="2"> 178 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 39 (2012) ... he will disappear again as soon as that knowledge has discovered a new form. (xxiii)  Recently, theoretical elaborations of posthumanity have described “new forms” that subjectivity assumes within the postmodern configurations of power/knowledge.They have often focused on corporeality as the site where the transformation of humans is effected. In Donna Haraway’s “The Cyborg Manifesto” (1985), for example, the appearance of the posthuman cyborg is inseparable from “communication sciences and modern biologies,” which are “the crucial tools recrafting our bodies” (Haraway 155, 164). N. Katherine Hayles’s foundational How We Became Posthuman (1999), however, shifts the problem of subjectivity away from “recrafting our bodies” and into the realm of language and discourse. For humans to disappear, no spectacular feats of bioengineering are necessary. Humanism, in its psychological, ideological, and representational aspects, is no more than “a wrinkle in our knowledge,” as Foucault argues, that can be ironed out by history.  The trope of alien infestation literalizes the cultural disintegration of the human as the diegetic transformation of a human subject into a post/inhuman entity. This transformation preserves the body but re-crafts the mind. The resulting posthuman subject presents a narratological quandary: it is simultaneously contiguous with humanity and thus speaks in a human voice, yet is also radically Other and undermines the very discourse that has called it into being.2 In this essay, I explore the formal, ideological, and ontological ramifications of this paradox, considering alien infestation as a discursive site where the human meets its narrative nemesis. Speaking (as) Other. The primary means for representing subjectivity in the literary text is narrative voice. In the case of a first-person narrator, we have direct access to his/her interiority. When the narrator is omniscient, it often deploys focalization—limiting itself to the point of view of particular characters.3 If the omniscient narrator also uses the focalizer’s individual idiom, the result is free indirect discourse, which enables the reader’s access to the focalizer’s experiential and linguistic world without actually having him/her as the sole narrator.  The issue of narrative voice is central to my analysis of alien infestation. Rather than guessing the authors’ intentions, reconstructing the political climate, or suggesting the artistic merits of these works, I would like to pose a narratological query that interrogates the textual construction of alien subjectivity through the deployment of quasi-realistic representational techniques. I suggest that the breakdown of these techniques charts an ideological (and perhaps even ontological) resistance to posthumanity on the level of narrative discourse.     It has become a commonplace that our subjectivities are shaped by the stories we tell about ourselves or, in a more elaborate formulation, that narratology is engaged in describing the “role of narrative positionality in forming subjectivity,” which simultaneously implies the textual positions of the implied </page> <page sequence="3"> ALIEN INFESTATION AND THE POETICS OF SUBJECTIVITY 179 author/reader and “the structure of [the text’s] multiple voices,” in particular, those of its narrator(s) (Currie 32, 23). Humanism, then, is as much a specific narrative template as it is an ideology; or rather the two are inseparable. If, indeed, stories can “control us ..., manufacture our moral personalities,” then the personalities that are manufactured by the techniques of psychological realism are both human and humanist (Currie 18).  The humanist self is consistent and coherent. Peter Rabinowitz points out that “when we read nineteenth- and twentieth-century narratives, we tend, on the whole, to assume a kind of consistency of character” that enables moral judgment (86; emphasis in original). This assumption is not only deeply rooted in our culture but is called forth by the specific narrative techniques of realism. As a non-mimetic genre, sf can use narrative strategies impossible within the confines of realistic representation. Sherryl Vint argues that “SF is particularly suited to exploring the question of the posthuman because it is a discourse that allows us to concretely imagine bodies and selves otherwise, a discourse defined by its ability to estrange our commonplace perceptions of reality” (19). The genre’s techniques of estrangement often operate on a different level from the narrative construction of subjectivity, however. The genre’s narrative innovation (the novum, in Darko Suvin’s classic formulation) is primarily ontological, relating to the overall structure of the fictional world. Its techniques of point of view, on the other hand, are fairly traditional. Sf is a popular genre and with some notable exceptions uses the familiar plot and characterization patterns of realism, thus distinguishing itself from “mainstream” postmodern fiction.4 When the character in question is not human, however, these techniques lead to literary anthropomorphism—the representation of the Other as the Same. In animal fables, the animal narrator or focalizer is deliberately “gifted” with a human sensibility. In Leo Tolstoy’s novella “Kholstomer” (1886), for example, narrated in the first person by a horse, Kholstomer’s patience and common sense is sharply contrast with the foibles of his human masters. Tolstoy, of course, no more intended to probe the mysteries of the animal mind than did George Orwell in Animal Farm (1945); his goal was to critique human cruelty and folly. But where the artistic goal is to represent the Other as Other, first-person narration or focalization backfires. Sf differs from the animal fable or allegory precisely in attempting to depict its non-human characters (or actants) as non- human. It creates fictional worlds “that are ... radically distanced or estranged from any collaborative effort of world construction outside their own modal intertext” and are populated by radically distanced or estranged subjects (Broderick 49). And so sf is caught in a double bind: its use of realistic narrative techniques to represent subjectivity undermines its exploration of alien subjects.  This bind is all too obvious in the innumerable sf texts dealing with human/alien contact. Such texts normally opt for one of two strategies: either they represent the alien subject from the outside, eschewing any attempt to convey a non-human interiority, or they adopt a first-person or inner focalization technique that inevitably results in anthropomorphism. The first strategy is rarer and more epistemologically challenging, but it has been used to great effect in such works as Stanislaw Lem’s Eden (1959) and Fiasco (1989) </page> <page sequence="4"> 180 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 39 (2012) and Michael Bishop’s Transfigurations (1980), in which the (often doomed) quest to communicate with the Other becomes the focus of the text. The second strategy is so ubiquitous that examples can be found in almost any sf text dealing with aliens. To take one almost at random: Toni Anzetti’s Typhon’s Children (1999) starts as an ontological mystery about the planet Typhon, where human colonists are slowly assimilated into the violent ecosphere. But once the focalization shifts from the human protagonist Langstaff to an alien inhabitant of Typhon, the impending transformation of the human population becomes a matter of corporeal modification only, leaving the narrative subjectivity intact. The very language used to convey the thoughts and sensations of the alien denies that it is alien. The Other becomes merely an allegorical disguise for the Same.  In the case of alien infestation, both techniques are inadequate. Since the posthuman subject is neither totally Same nor totally Other, both external representation (found in Campbell) and internal focalization (employed by Heinlein and Sigler) fail in coming to grips with its ontology. In fact, as I will show below, both techniques fracture precisely at the fault line between the humanist construction of the subject and its transformation into post/inhuman. This fracture becomes the locus of the narrative’s resistance to the challenge of posthumanity—the challenge that occurs on the level of what Fredric Jameson called “the content of the form,” as opposed to “the content of the content” (84). The content of the form is largely independent of the overt ideological message of the text or the author’s intention; it resides in the implications of the narrative techniques used and can (and often does) contradict the content of the content.  Alien infestation texts respond to diverse cultural and psychological fears and anxieties. While most express horror at the dissolution of human subjectivity, others regard the alien invader as a means of transcendence (see, for example, Greg Bear’s Blood Music [1985]). But all alien infestation texts display, albeit in varying degrees, the basic disparity between narrative techniques used to represent the human/ist subject and thematic concern with the posthuman. In other words, the texts do not merely depict the alien infestation of the human/ist subject but dramatize it through their narrative form. Novels of alien infestation are textual sites where the narrative techniques of humanism splinter under the thematic impact of posthumanity. The Monster Next Door. The two most common approaches to the trope of alien infestation have been psychoanalytical and political/allegorical. Rosemary Jackson analyzes it as an expression of a drive “towards a state of indifferentiation of self from other” (59). Politically, it has often been associated with the “pulp” years of the 1950s, when Cold War paranoia generated allegories of Communist takeover. In Robert A. Heinlein: America as Science Fiction (1980), for example, H. Bruce Franklin describes Heinlein’s The Puppet Masters as a transient piece of political propaganda:  The Puppet Masters (1951) has much the same message as the 1951 movie I Was a Communist for the FBI. It is a Cold War allegory, which, like the 1956 movie Invasion of the Body Snatchers adapted from the 1954 Jack Finney novel, warns </page> <page sequence="5"> ALIEN INFESTATION AND THE POETICS OF SUBJECTIVITY 181 of the insidious Communist menace, projected in the form of alien invaders taking over the bodies and minds of Americans. (98)  Yet if the psychoanalytical approach de-historicizes the trope, the political one squeezes it into Procrustean time limits.The trope, in fact, came into being before the Cold War and has persisted after the collapse of the USSR. Finney’s The Body Snatchers has been made into a movie four times, the latest remake (titled simply The Invasion) appearing in 2007. Jerry Jay Carroll’s Inhuman Beings was published in 1998. The recent bestsellers by Scott Sigler, Infected (2006) and Contagious (2008), are The Puppet Masters on steroids. And many non-American texts use this trope or its variants, such as the Japanese novel Parasite Eve by Hideaki Sena (1995) and the Soviet bestseller Dom skitateley [The House of Wanderers] by Alexander Mirer (1978). This by no means complete list indicates that alien infestation cannot be reduced simply to McCarthyism.  What unites all these texts, regardless of the period or even national origin, is a shared narrative dilemma: how can a human narrative voice be used to represent a post/inhuman subjectivity? Can such a subjectivity be represented at all without lapsing into a poetics of corporeal monstrosity? The desperate quest of the human characters in alien infestation texts to root out and unmask the alien invaders parallels the ontological and narratological conundrum posed by a posthuman subjectivity in a human body.  Identity on Ice. Although Heinlein’s The Puppet Masters remains a paradigm for alien infestation, the first influential use of this trope in sf preceded it by almost 15 years. In 1938 John Campbell, the legendary editor of Astounding, published the novella “Who Goes There?” that later became the basis for the 1951 film The Thing from Another World and John Carpenter’s 1982 remake The Thing. In Campbell’s novella, the crew of an Antarctic research station digs up and thaws out the corpse of a malevolent alien being whose spaceship had crashed on the ice twenty thousand years previously. Because the being can consume and perfectly imitate its victims, the station’s crew is divided into true human beings and alien simulacra. The latter are eventually unmasked and the novella ends with an orgy of horrific violence against the impostors. The nature of the alien is hotly debated by the members of the expedition once they become aware of the infestation. Blair the biologist who is responsible for its release, insists that the alien is merely different from humans rather than essentially malevolent: “Just because its nature is different, you haven’t any right to say it’s necessarily evil” (306). Tough guys Norris and McReady contradict him, convinced that (because the alien in its natural form looks evil) it is evil. Here the conventional fairy-tale paradigm of ugly equals bad is deployed in an sf context, belying the genre’s cognitive sophistication and bringing it closer to the “science fantasy” excoriated by Darko Suvin in his Metamorphoses of Science Fiction as ideologically pernicious and intellectually puerile (68-69). This simplistic equation is undermined, however, by the fact that once the alien consumes members of the expedition and generates simulacra, they are </page> <page sequence="6"> 182 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 39 (2012) visually indistinguishable from the originals. In fact, the only way to tell a human from an alien is to burn his blood with a hot iron rod, a method that shifts the very definition of otherness from self-evident and visually striking to hidden and disguised. The novella provides a quasi-scientific explanation for the procedure, thus eventually conforming to Suvin’s definition of sf in terms of “cognitive estrangement.” In his discussion of “Who Goes There?” Thomas Clareson emphasizes the novella’s dual treatment of “horror” and scientific reasoning and argues that despite its fairy-tale elements, it qualifies as sf. According to Clareson, “a basic pattern or narrative strategy of SF is the presentation of a problem of a scientific nature ... which the protagonist can solve ... only by drawing on a personal knowledge of natural law,” and this is precisely the pattern that structures Campbell’s novella (25). The world of the novella is ultimately what Asimov calls a “sane” world “in which crises are overcome by the rational discussions and actions of [the] characters” (qtd.in Clareson 25). This analysis, however, overlooks the fact that “rational discussion” is a rather inadequate description of the violence of the plot, in which the characters savagely turn against each other, consumed by paranoia: “is that man next to me an inhuman monster?” (343; emphasis in original). Axes, guns, and hot irons become the means of demarcating the elusive boundary between human and nonhuman. But in this very savagery, the definition of the alien shifts from moral to ontological. If the conspicuous ugliness of the original monster was a sure sign of its evil, once otherness is internalized its nature becomes much more ambiguous. McReady cynically describes the entire expedition as consisting of “monsters, madmen and murderers,” with no clear dividing lines among them (340). Once monstrosity passes from the realm of the corporeal to the realm of the psychic, it can be neither defined nor rooted out. Perhaps, as Dr. Copper suggests, “we are all monsters” (330).  This alien-infested subjectivity becomes what Jean Baudrillard calls a simulacrum; it is a copy without an original, whose very existence undermines the concepts of referentiality, reality, and truth. At the beginning of the novella, McReady articulates a liberal-humanist view of subjectivity based on the uniqueness and originality of the individual: “though you know that the thing might ... look like Connant, you are not much bothered because you know it has a mind from another world, a totally inhuman mind.... The idea of the creature imitating one of us is fascinating, but unreal, because it is too completely unhuman to deceive us. It doesn’t have a human mind” (316). But this view is demolished when it becomes clear that the “monsters” are indeed perfect copies of the human originals, capable of deceiving even the comrades with whom they have lived in close proximity for many months. In fact, it is possible that the simulacra themselves may not know who they are. If so, what is the significance of a difference that makes no difference? This becomes a central issue in the novella, as the characters debate the definition of humanity. Evil, violence, and ferocity are progressively discarded as the hallmarks of the monster, since both human and inhuman characters display exactly the same characteristics. McReady sums it up: “I underrated </page> <page sequence="7"> ALIEN INFESTATION AND THE POETICS OF SUBJECTIVITY 183 man’s abilities when I said nothing human could have the ferocity in the eyes of that thing we found” (346). Eventually, the only distinguishing feature of the Other becomes its capacity to be the Same. What makes the aliens “superhuman” is precisely the fact that they have “powers of imitation beyond any concept of man”—in other words, the fact that they are human (318-19). This aporia of humanity is described on the thematic level. But more importantly, it is also acted out on the level of the novella’s narration. “Who Goes There?” has a third-person extradiegetic and omniscient narrator and is marked by total lack of focalization. The characters’ actions are described and some information on the setting is given. But there is no access whatsoever to any of the characters’ interiority. Whether man or monster, we know only what each of them does, not what he feels or thinks. This is highly unusual, even in Golden Age sf which is not notable for psychological sophistication. Campbell’s flat narrative voice goes beyond the focus on action that he himself, in his capacity as editor extraordinaire, demanded from his authors. Nor is it the result of a lack of skill: in other novellas, such as “Twilight” (1934), Campbell successfully deploys internal focalization. “Who Goes There?” is, within its own parameters, a very successful text: it has an almost hallucinatory visual intensity, which perhaps accounts for the fact that it has been the basis of three blockbuster movies.  In this emphasis on vision, the significance of language as the demarcation between human and non-human is invalidated. Humanity is transformed into “a precession of simulacra,” the proliferation of images without depth and of actants without subjectivity. The horror of alien infestation lies in the fact that it changes nothing. The three men who escape the wreck of the station, having slaughtered their erstwhile comrades, are monsters of the Same. They are copies without originals, self-replicating images whose humanity is a meaningless imitation of itself. Posthumanity is not the next stage of human evolution but rather the recognition that “true” humanity never existed in the first place. The radical implication of the novella’s narrative voice thus conflicts with its plot of a ruthless purification whose violence is ratcheted up with every new revelation of the congruency between human and inhuman. The plot corresponds to what Gilles Deleuze describes as “a great machinery, an already industrialized organization” of apocalyptic judgment (44; emphais in original). The “great machinery” of plot violence constitutes the locus of the text’s conservative ideology, which lies not in any straightforward political allegory but rather in the resolve to preserve “humanity” at any cost, despite revealing it as merely an empty image. The central question that Campbell’s novella poses is the question of difference: what makes a posthuman posthuman? And its answer echoes Lyotard’s observation that humanity is always already inhabited by the inhuman. It is the answer given, in different ways, by many alien infestation texts. In Finney’s The Body Snatchers, one of the pod people, trying to talk the protagonist into surrender, tells him: “You’ll feel nothing at all. Sleep, and you’ll wake up feeling exactly the same as you do now.... You’ll be the same. What the hell are you fighting?” (179; emphasis in original).  </page> <page sequence="8"> 184 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 39 (2012) Nevertheless, even today most popular sf is committed to the ideology of liberal humanism. And so in order to police the elusive boundary between human and posthuman/inhuman, more and more radical violence is unleashed. Narratologically speaking, such texts are sites of a structural battle between plot and voice. Their narrative voices, whether the extradiegetic narrator as in “Who Goes There?” or more complex first-person narrators, as in the texts I will discuss below, reveal the continuity of human and posthuman, while their plots of violent paranoia belie it.  But it is a battle won by the voice. Since human and posthuman are continuous, the latter can never be rooted out completely. Finney’s first-person narrator Miles ends the novel by doubting his own sanity and even his own humanity: “Even now—so soon—there are times, and they come frequently, when I’m no longer certain in my mind of just what we did see, or of what really happened here” (219). The contagion of posthumanity, instead of having been cured, may in fact have become chronic. Puppets on a String. Heinlein’s The Puppet Masters deserves its reputation as dramatizing “an intensely paranoid vision of reality” (Franklin 98). It describes the invasion of Earth by mind-controlling “slugs” from Titan who almost take over the United States but are eventually beaten back by an intrepid band of secret agents; these include the novel’s narrator and protagonist Sam, his wife and fellow agent Mary, and their boss, the Old Man, who is also Sam’s father. More overtly political than either Campbell’s or Finney’s texts, Heinlein’s novel actually invites allegorical readings of its uncompromising and explicit anti- Communism. Sam, for example, snidely remarks that the “parasites might feel right at home behind the Curtain” (148). The novel sets a different agenda, however, epistemological rather than political, from the start. It begins with the question: “Were they [the slugs] truly intelligent?” (1).Though Sam modestly states that, being a simple agent, he is not qualified to answer the question, neither, it seems, is anybody else. The question remains open; the nature of the slugs (or titans, as they are also called) is obscure. So it is all the more striking that after such an opening, the novel closes with the jingoistic, paranoid slogan, “Death and Destruction!” as Sam and his cohorts embark on a crusade to follow the slugs back to their home planet and eradicate them completely (340).  Franklin marvels at the explosion of xenophobia at the end of The Puppet Masters that contradicts Heinlein’s message of “respect” for alien life in his juvenile space epics (100). But in the course of the novel, Sam the narrator, along with all the other major characters, has been possessed by a slug. And though the slug possession is ostensibly reversible, it leaves an indelible imprint on the host. When Sam is released from the slug, he still feels the taint of the “master” in his soul. He is “spoiled”: “being ridden by a master does something to you” (149).  The first-person voice at the end of the novel belongs to a different subject from the Sam who speaks at the beginning. Retrospective narration always involves a gap between the self that acts and the self that recollects and tells the </page> <page sequence="9"> ALIEN INFESTATION AND THE POETICS OF SUBJECTIVITY 185 story. But in The Puppet Masters, this gap becomes an ontological abyss. If the Sam who erupts in genocidal violence is the Sam “tainted” by a slug, then the locus of this violence becomes hard to pinpoint. Since “every one of us who is going [to fight the slugs] has been possessed at least once” (339), whose fight is it? In contrast to the external, extradiegetic narrator of “Who Goes There?” The Puppet Masters has a diegetic, first-person protagonist-narrator, the kind of narrator that enables complete access to the novel’s representation of subjectivity. This is the narrator often found in the bildungsroman, the novel of psychological development, such as Dickens’s David Copperfield (1850). It is arguable that Sam undergoes such development: he is reconciled to his father, marries and starts a family, and becomes a mature member of his masculine, autocratic, paramilitary society. But the smooth trajectory of this maturation is irrevocably disrupted by the possession.  Sam is possessed twice, the first time unwittingly when he is infected by the slug from another victim and the second time when the Old Man needs to interrogate an alien invader and Sam volunteers. There is no narrative or typographical break in the text to indicate his transformation. In the first case, the reader is not even immediately aware that something has happened and neither is Sam. In his capacity as a retrospective narrator, he grapples with the recollections of the period of his life when he worked for the slugs and muses on the limitations of human language to convey a non-human subjectivity: “Language grows, so they say, to describe the experience of the race using it. Experience first—language second. How can I tell how I felt?” (65). The only way to tell, it seems, is by appropriating the language of mystical experience. Sam-with-slug basks in the sense of well-being and purposefulness that comes with an awareness of divine protection: “although I did not know what I was about to do, I was always aware of what I was doing and sure that each act was the necessary, purposeful act at that moment” (65). Though he is horrified by the prospect of being slug-ridden again, once it happens, the sense of well-being reasserts itself: “I had neither worries nor fears. I was oddly contented to be back with my master, to be free of troubles and tensions. My business was to serve and the future would take care of itself” (99). And when the tough-as-nails Old Man, possessed by a slug in the course of his patriotic duty, is willing to sacrifice his only son, he experiences a similar epiphany of love: “I had no idea that a man could feel such a sense of peace and contentment and well-being. This is the happiest I’ve been in years, the happiest since ... your mother died. But never mind that; this is better” (332).  The mere suspicion that surrendering to the slugs may be better than fighting them unleashes a veritable orgy of violence. Sam shoots anybody he suspects of being infected; armed vigilantes strip passers-by to ascertain their purity; and the President of the United States considers dropping an atomic bomb on the infected area. But the shriller this litany of purification gets, the more it appears unnecessary. The unbroken continuity of Sam’s narrative voice undermines his assertion that possession destroys subjectivity. As long as the narrative “I” persists, there is a self behind it, though not necessarily a human self. </page> <page sequence="10"> 186 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 39 (2012) In describing his experience with the slug, Sam struggles with pronouns, slipping from the first-person singular to the first-person plural, and occasionally even to the third-person inanimate, as he compares his relationship with his master to the relationship between a man and a phone: “I, like it, was a communication instrument, nothing more” (71). But on the other hand, in the second episode of possession he identifies with the master completely, using the first-person singular to describe both of them. Ultimately, he decides that the pronoun confusion does not matter since his transformed subjectivity transcends the limitations of a human language: “An instruction came at once—or, I made a decision, for the words mean the same” (99-100). In his discussion of Stevenson’s Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1886), Mark Currie analyzes this early sf text as a parable of the splitting and fragmentation of the self. The pronoun confusion that permeates the first-person portions of Stevenson’s novel exemplifies “man’s multifarious polity of denizens”—the unstable subjectivity that is simultaneously held together and irrevocably fissured by the act of self-narration (120). The psychological fragmentation is exacerbated by a (post)modern awareness of the multiplicity and contingency of identity. Donna Haraway singles out this awareness as the dominant feature of the transition from the liberal-humanist subject to the posthuman “partial, contradictory, permanently unclosed constructions of personal and collective selves” (157). The paradoxes of Sam’s narrative voice in The Puppet Masters may be read as inscribing the emergence of such a “contradictory” self from the faux- realistic matrix of a soldier’s bildungsroman. This emergence is perceived to be so threatening that it invites a bloody retribution whose purifying violence is in direct proportion to the severity of the perceived threat. The exposure to posthuman disease, however, is sufficient to infect humanity forever with the virus of alterity. The voice that intones “Death and Destruction!” at the end of the novel is the voice of Sam remade in the image of his own fear of the alien—opaque, merciless, and irredeemably evil.  Being (In)human. Like The Puppet Masters and The Body Snatchers, Jerry Jay Carroll’s Inhuman Beings (1998) is narrated in the first person, this time by tough guy Goodwin Armstrong, who unmasks alien invaders and embarks on a savage crusade to root them out. The novel has a curiously old-fashioned feel: set in the Bay Area, with Armstrong as a stereotypical private eye, it combines a self-conscious homage to film noir with a pastiche of the alien-infestation texts of the 1950s.  There are, however, two significant ways in which it deviates from its predecessors. It lacks the anti-Communist allegory discernible in the Cold War texts of Finley and Heinlein and it seems curiously unconcerned with any cognitive aspect of the invasion. While all other alien-infestation texts at least try to offer some quasi-scientific explanation of the invaders’ nature and methods, Carroll’s narrator brushes aside such issues. We never know how the invaders take over human hosts. There is no material “symptom” by which the alien-infested posthumans can be recognized. The only way in which Armstrong </page> <page sequence="11"> ALIEN INFESTATION AND THE POETICS OF SUBJECTIVITY 187 identifies the enemy is, to put it mildly, highly subjective: they have “cold eyes.” On this flimsy basis, he unleashes a one-man terror campaign against San Francisco, fire-bombing a security firm, shooting the mayor, and mowing down anybody who stands in his way, including his partner. All this is done without any compunction or hesitation. Compared to Armstrong, Campbell’s Arctic explorers and Sam-the-secret-agent are as scrupulous as Hamlet. His appalling ruthlessness makes Armstrong’s first-person narrative particularly tricky. The dynamics of the reader’s response make it inevitable that we initially identify with Armstrong and see him as a lonely hero, a modern-day Paul Revere. Literature, however, abounds in unreliable first-person narrators, madmen, or killers, such as the narrator of Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Tell-Tale Heart” (1843), whose initial appeal to the reader is gradually turned into horrified recoil when we realize that the author has cleverly manipulated us into siding with an insane murderer. Can Armstrong be seen as unreliable?  The poetics of unreliability hinge on the gap between the narrator and the implied author. While an enlightened reader may despise Sam, Heinlein clearly does not. Nor is there any indication in The Puppet Masters that the entire invasion has been a hallucination of his paranoid mind.  But Armstrong begins to have doubts about his own sanity quite early in the novel:  As I lie here on the cot and consider it objectively, I see how someone could conclude I was insane. I shoot a man dead, a friend and business partner, and afterwards avoid stepping on his lawn out of respect. Take aliens out of the mix and it is psychotic behavior, especially when you factor in no remorse. (147) Indeed. And since there is no objective sign of the alien possession equivalent to the presence of a slug on the body in Heinlein’s novel or the crawling blood in Campbell’s story, why should not the aliens be taken “out of the mix”? Armstrong’s flat affect, self-righteousness, and lack of curiosity and empathy all mark him as a sociopath, one of those “types without conscience” with which he is very familiar (147). And since the only hallmark of the aliens is precisely that lack of affect, there is no way of demarcating the boundaries of humanity not just in the city but also within the narrator’s subjectivity. Several times Armstrong fantasizes about what would happen if the aliens got him: “My soul or personality or whatever would be sucked out just like that, leaving only the husk” (179). But there is precious little evidence of the “soul” being there in the first place. Perhaps Armstrong has already been possessed; perhaps there have never been any aliens; or perhaps it makes no difference whether there are or are not. The narrative unreliability, implicit in Armstrong’s self-doubt, blurs the dividing line between human and in/posthuman in an even more radical way than in the texts I have considered above. Campbell and Finley question the difference of the simulacrum. If it is indistinguishable from the original, why is it not the original? But Carroll’s text goes beyond such questioning, suggesting not that aliens are human but that humans are already and perhaps always have been aliens. </page> <page sequence="12"> 188 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 39 (2012) Of course, a popular text cannot rest with such a narratively and ideologically murky position. The second half of the novel, chock-full of violent action, sets out to rehabilitate Armstrong and dispel our suspicions of his sanity by unleashing a full-scale war of independence, led by a Texan President against the invaders. Hasty and poorly written, this second half of Inhuman Beings reads like a parody of itself, with all-too-discernible jingoistic echoes of the 1996 movie Independence Day. As with all other alien-infestation texts, the physical violence deflects but does not disguise the linguistic and narrative violence perpetrated on the traditional concept of the human subject. The more the text attempts to dispel doubts about the meaning of humanity raised by the sociopathic voice of the narrator as he exterminates the “evil” sociopathic invaders, the more it unwittingly confirms those very doubts. The political dimension of the text emphasizes its internalization of the alien threat. Written after the collapse of the USSR, it does not turn abroad in search of new enemies, as Independence Day does with its overt xenophobia. Instead, hints scattered throughout the text both covertly and overtly encourage readers to interpret the aliens as allegorical stand-ins for the federal government. The aliens methodically take over big corporations, political organizations, the media, and finally the FBI. The President only avoids their clutches by taking to the hills in a beat-up bus. Armstrong’s strongest supporters are militia types and conspiracy theorists who call the media to describe their experience with black helicopters: “I wasn’t a murderer to these callers but a hero. Many suspected that the United Nations was mixed up with this somehow” (190). The populist rage, the self-righteous paranoia, and the disdain for lawyers and politicians are all hallmarks of the radical conservatism that has been gaining ground in the US for the last two decades. Written long before the emergence of the Tea Party, Inhuman Beings nevertheless accurately reflects the mindset of this movement and its predecessors. The enemy is no longer a Communist saboteur or a racial Other. The enemy is ourselves.   In the Flesh. Scott Sigler’s bestselling novels Infected (2008) and Contagious (2008) not only represent the contagion of posthumanity but actually enact it. The story they tell is familiar: an alien infection is spreading in many bizarre forms throughout the United States and turning its victims into living hatcheries and/or obedient and homicidal slaves of their invisible masters. But the novels themselves are the epitome of the web cliché “going viral.” Both Infected and Contagious were first released as podcasts, and the print versions to which I will refer are revisions of the electronic format. The hype surrounding Sigler as the world’s first podcasting author was such that both novels shot to the New York Times bestseller list on the first days of their publication. Podcasts or not, Infected and Contagious follow the alien-contagion plot line; in fact, their adherence to the Golden Age sf formula makes them fine examples of postmodern pastiche. In the first novel, protagonist Scary Perry Dawsey, a tough former linebacker, is infected by an otherworldly version of the so-called Morgellons  disease. The disease, spread by engineered spores dropped from a tiny alien satellite, first germinates “in a microscopic pile of bug shit” and then </page> <page sequence="13"> ALIEN INFESTATION AND THE POETICS OF SUBJECTIVITY 189 becomes airborne and attacks humans (Infected 17). The results, presented with obvious relish, are extremely unpleasant: “What arrived in a microscopic seed had hijacked the host’s body and used the built-in biological processes to create something foreign, in a way far more insidious than even a virus” (23). The symptoms begin with a skin itch, develop into a homicidal mania, and eventually produce parasitic blue triangles with black eyes that “talk” (in typographically interesting ways) to the hosts, order them to perform various atrocities, and eventually hatch out of their ruined bodies and congregate together to build organic “gates” through which the real aliens will come to conquer the Earth. Nobody can resist the influence of the triangles except for Perry, who (toughened by his natural aggression and memories of childhood abuse at the hands of his father) inflicts upon himself the most extreme case of home cure ever seen in a work of fiction, literally cutting the invaders out with a fork and a knife. This radical do-it-yourself surgery (culminating in self- castration) works: Perry survives with his humanity, such as it is, intact. In Contagious, the scope broadens, as a patched-up Perry, now capable of acting as a human detector of the infected, joins forces with CIA agent and Vietnam vet Dew Phillips, and pits himself against the new mutation of the disease that produces an organic network of telepathically-joined hosts presided over by a seven-year-old girl named Chelsea. Naturally, science fails to halt the spread of the disease and only the brute force of unthinking patriotism carries the day. Though initially misled by his liberal advisors, the new Hispanic president John Gutierrez does the right thing and drops a nuclear bomb on Detroit to cauterize the disease. Perry dies as a martyr, although not before shooting Chelsea in the face. It is easy to see this post-9/11 paranoid joyride as a political allegory. What “Commies” were for Heinlein, bleeding-heart liberals are for Sigler. Just as in Heinlein’s novel, there are enough explicit political references to divert the critic’s attention from the novels’ complex narrative structure. Dr. Margaret Montoya, for example, who studies the disease, is approvingly described as not “some science-type doom-and-gloom preaching about yet another pending global-warming catastrophe” (Infected 33). (She is still not tough enough to kill her patients and so fails as a savior.) The macho military ethos, with its delight in the sadomasochistic rituals of brotherhood-in-arms, is carried over wholesale from Heinlein. In fact, except for greater firepower and more technological savvy, little seems to have changed in the fifty-something years separating the Cold War from the War on Terror. But there is one salient difference between Heinlein’s and Sigler’s novels, which I will argue profoundly impacts the latter’s representation of posthumanity. As opposed to the consistent first-person voice of The Puppet Masters and Carroll’s Inhuman Beings, Sigler’s novels use a wide variety of focalizers, with each short chapter presented through a different character. In the first novel, focalization eventually (though never exclusively) centers on Perry; in the second, it is more widespread and includes many alien-infected hosts, including Chelsea herself. </page> <page sequence="14"> 190 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 39 (2012) In part this is the result of the novels’ initial distribution through podcasting: multiple focalization helps cut the texts into manageable and self-contained chunks. But this technological innovation is not external to the texts’ meaning. Rather, it constructs this meaning in the same way that the diffuse and distributed computer networks construct the diffuse and distributed subjectivities of the emergent posthuman. The paradox is that while the innovative podcasting form enacts Haraway’s notion of “distributed networks” (165), creating a “cyborg” text, the conservative content of the text is aggressively “humanist.” Sigler’s texts actively fight against the implications of their own form. Multiple focalization enables readers to access the interiority of a wide range of subjects: “normative” humans such as Dew and Montoya; characters in the process of transition such as Perry; the many hosts who have been taken over and are controlled by the triangles; and the ultimate posthuman, the little girl Chelsea, who ultimately transcends the distinctions between human and alien, male and female, singular and plural. Addressing Perry, Chelsea says: “We’re like a new person now. A superorganism” (Contagious 427; emphasis in original). Chelsea is the queen of the hive of the converted, the embodiment of the alien “collective organism” (309). And yet, despite this profound inhumanity, Chelsea is the one focalizer whose subjectivity is most vividly conveyed in the novel. This is achieved by use of free indirect discourse. The technique enables much deeper penetration into the focalizers’ inner worlds and facilitates the reader’s sympathy toward them: “the tinting of the narrator’s speech with the character’s language or mode of experience may promote an empathetic identification on the part of the reader” (Rimmon-Kenan 116). In Contagious, the most consistent use of free indirect discourse occurs with Chelsea. We are asked to feel “empathetic identification” toward the least human of all characters. Chelsea, even while transforming into a telepathic queen-bee of the alien collective organism, is still a little girl who likes ice-cream and regards the triangular hatchlings parasitizing in human flesh as “dollies”:  Chelsea felt her mind spread farther and farther. This was so cool. Better than all her toys combined. She’d felt Dustin hit those men, like she had been there, like she had hit them herself. She liked it. It was really fun. Every time she spread her mind, the feeling got stronger, the connection got stronger. Each host, each dolly, each converted person—they all felt a little different. Kind of like how vanilla ice cream tastes one way and chocolate another way. That was it; each had its own taste. (Contagious 255; emphasis in original)  While presented as alien contagion, this is in fact an ordinary child’s thinking. The use of free indirect discourse exposes the psychic layers of childhood that exceed the constraints of the liberal-humanist subject and constitute what Lyotard calls “the secret [inhumanity] of which the soul is hostage” (2). This inhumanity, the remainder of the alien in children, is repressed by the education that “makes them fit to share in communal life, adult consciousness and reason,” but it persists as the very foundation of humanity, so that “what is ‘proper’ to humankind [is] inhabited by the inhuman” (2-3). In Chelsea’s </page> <page sequence="15"> ALIEN INFESTATION AND THE POETICS OF SUBJECTIVITY 191 horribly naïve babbling, the inhuman gushes forth, revealing that the alien disease which inhabits subjectivity is not the invader but the host.  The language of the Other spills over from the Chelsea sections of the novel, crystallizing into an alternative discourse that shadows and eventually overtakes the technological-military discourse that defines the transformation as a disease. This alternative discourse is the language of prophecy, and Chelsea is its divinity.  In the first novel, the triangles bully and threaten Perry and other victims. In the second novel, the disease cajoles and seduces. And its seduction is the same age-old offer of unconditional love and mystical oneness that has been the draw of all religions. This mystical oneness is intimated in The Puppet Masters in the possessed Sam’s contentment and his father’s joyful surrender. But in Contagious it is articulated almost to the point of caricature. The alien satellite that coordinated the growth of the superorganism “made them one” (Contagious 348; emphasis in original). And when it is shot down, Chelsea takes its place: “Now Chelsea was God” (348; emphasis in original). The initiation into this divine unity is spread through a kiss—a parody of the early Christian Kiss of Peace with which the believers greeted each other. The oneness and peace offered by Chelsea-as-God are quite real; even Perry is eventually made to feel them: “Emotions of love, admiration, even awe, they rolled through him, too strong to deny.... A connection from infinite distance, the treads of the universe binding, entwining, coalescing into something that blended all existence. Purity” (Contagious 412; emphasis in original). Of course, using children to represent the inhuman and/or divine within humanity is not new in sf: a classic example is “It’s a Good Life!” by Jerome Bixby (1953). But Chelsea is different, both because of the extensive focalization that allows us a much fuller access to her psychic interiority than in Bixby’s story and because her role as the wonder-child seamlessly meshes with the plot of transition into posthumanity. At the beginning, Chelsea is an ordinary, rather silly little girl. Her narrative transformation occurs gradually, as an evolutionary development rather than as an abrupt metamorphosis. The boundary between human and posthuman is not erased as in The Puppet Masters but methodically dismantled. When, in the last part of Contagious, Perry is vouchsafed a glimpse of Chelsea’s mind, he perceives a divine attentiveness that does not distinguish between background and foreground, together with a sublime indifference to petty moral distinctions. Chelsea is not evil, like the evil children of horror literature such as The Omen (1976) or The Bad Seed (1954). She is beyond good and evil: The intensity shocked him. It felt as if every little emotion was the most important thing that could possibly happen. And yet behind the intensity lay a curious blankness, the feeling that she wasn’t good or evil. Chelsea didn’t know what good and evil were. (Contagious; 351) Both Christianity and Nietzsche are conscripted to represent Chelsea’s transfigured consciousness. </page> <page sequence="16"> 192 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 39 (2012) These glimpses of the posthuman are enough to provoke a hysterical reaction. The overkill of the novels’ endings (self-castration in Infected; nuclear devastation in Contagious) indicates the intolerable generic/ideological strain placed upon the humanist ethos of sf by the intrusion of posthumanity. And so, just like the “Death and Destruction!” of The Puppet Masters, the narrative closure of Sigler’s thrillers strives to contain the uncontainable—and, in doing so, spells its own generic doom. Chelsea and her superorganism might be destroyed, but the text itself, going viral on the web, enacts precisely the conditions of the posthuman plurality, multiplicity, fragmentation, and simulation that it so strenuously opposes.  Alien Tongue. The trope of alien infestation epitomizes the posthuman not as the inevitable result of technological innovation, be it the web, social media, bioengineering, or any combination thereof, but rather as a hidden potential within the humanist subject itself. The concept of posthumanity arises from the acknowledgment that “what is ‘proper’ to humankind” is “inhabited by the inhuman” (Lyotard 2). Alien infestation is an image of the inhuman that inhabits traditional concepts of subjectivity. The texts discussed above figure the double nature of posthumanity as an image of the future and an interpretation of the present—as the unknown horizon of our fears and expectations and as the residue of such fears and expectations within the very structure of humanism.  Close narratological study of alien-infestation texts reveals how subjectivity is constructed in, and through, language and narrative, and how humanity is under constant siege from within its own discursive paradigm. The locus of the posthuman in these texts is not the aliens: Campbell’s simulacra, Heinlein’s slugs, Carroll’s invisible invaders, and Sigler’s triangles are merely window- dressing for the deeper structural crises within the realistic discourse of subjectivity that occur when the “inhuman of the system” and “the inhuman of the psyche,” to use Lyotard’s terms, exert too much pressure on the conservative ideology of humanism. These crises can be read in the distortion and stumbling of the narrative voice. The posthuman emerges from within the narrative discourse of these texts, in the flat, external focalization of Campbell’s “Who Goes There?,” in the schizophrenic pronoun confusion of Sam’s narration in The Puppet Masters, in the narrative unreliability of Armstrong in Inhuman Beings, and as the viral proliferation of viewpoints in Sigler’s novels. Narrative forms are also “modes of subjectivity and identification,” discursive templates through which we actualize ourselves (Currie 130). The crisis of the human/ist subject results in an intolerable strain placed on the traditional templates of realistic narrative, with its assumptions of the subject’s unity, self-coherence, and deep psychological interiority. Instead, new forms are emerging in sf; not just in the shape of “new bodies,” as suggested by Haraway and Vint, but also in new narrative voices that undermine, distort, or explode the old forms of both extradiegetic and diegetic narration. Posthumanity is as much a political issue as it is a literary one. Throughout its history, the trope of alien infestation has been used to convey both fear of, and fascination with, the impending dissolution of humanism. The political threats to humanism in these texts range from Communism to governmental </page> <page sequence="17"> ALIEN INFESTATION AND THE POETICS OF SUBJECTIVITY 193 bureaucracy and from anarchy to repression, but there is always a surplus of meaning that is not reducible to one-to-one political allegory. This surplus reflects the inescapable presence of the inhuman within the very language we use to describe and define humanity. No matter how mightily Campbell, Heinlein, and Sigler struggle against the abyss of the post/inhuman opened up by their texts, no matter how much firepower is expended in eliminating its threat, hardware is useless against the slipperiness of words. Ultimately, the pod people cannot be defeated. The aliens are, and have always been, ourselves.  NOTES 1. There are many interesting examples of the trope of alien infestation from the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, including (but not limited to) John Christopher’s The Possessors (1965), Octavia Butler’s Clay’s Ark (1984), and Greg Bear’s Blood Music. In addition, the 1970s and 1980s saw the trope infesting (so to speak) the big screen, with such movies as They Live! (1988) and the 1978 version of The Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Each of these texts exhibits tensions and paradoxes similar to the ones I discuss in the essay, and each overlays these narratological rifts with its own more or less explicit ideological agenda. For reasons of length, I cannot address representative texts from every decade. 2. “Inhuman,” in Lyotard’s sense of the word, might be seen as a more appropriate description of such a transformed subject. I use “posthuman,” however, for two reasons: to contest a widespread view that links posthumanity to the rise of cyberpunk and to indicate the narrative progression of alien infestation. “Inhuman” in the texts I discuss is literally what comes after human in terms of plot development. 3. In classic narratology, the omniscient extradiegetic narrator is often referred to as “he.” I will use the inanimate pronoun to underscore the fact that we are dealing with a narrative technique rather than the personal voice of the author. 4.

ABSTRACT This article analyzes narrative representations of posthuman subjectivity in a range of sf texts that deal with a takeover of human beings by aliens, from Golden Age classics such as John Campbell’s “Who Goes There?” (1938) and Robert Heinlein’s The Puppet Masters (1951) to the contemporary blockbusters Infected (2006) and Contagious (2008) by Scott Sigler. I argue for a narratological analysis of such texts in terms of their deployment of the techniques of voice and point of view and suggest that, rather than being dismissed as naïve political allegories, these works should be read in terms of discursive and ideological tensions within humanism. </page> </plain_text>
