A detailed description of the vision is presented based on a photographic docu mentation of the radiotherapy room, a painting of the vision made by the visionary herself and narratives retold two weeks after the vision, and again, one year later. Perceptual, social, and psychodynamic psychological theories are used to analyze the psychological prerequisites of the vision. It is shown that the vision is, in psychological terms, an illusion rather than a hallucina tion. Different possible origin mechanisms to the vision are discussed as well as why the vision is attributed to Jesus. The psychological function of the vision is analyzed with regard to the vision ary's religious behaviour and the role of this experience in coping with the cancer disease. It is argued that the visionary's religious commitment is being strengthened and that the vision func tions as a catalyst for previously-formed religious coping mechanisms. It also initiates at least one new kind of religious coping mechanism in the visionary's coping system. A critical discussion of research methods concerning narratives of religious experiences is presented in the light of the results of the analyses undertaken in this paper where some problems with in-depth interviews conducted at one point in time are is highlighted. This kind of data collection appears more fragile when attempting to explain a phenomenon in terms of cause and events (in this case: the psychological prerequisites of the vision) than when trying to understand a phenomenon (in this case: the psychological function of the vision).

Lundmark/Archive for the Psychology of Religion 32 (2010) 27-68 Introduction Four things are attempted here: (1) to present an account of an experience of a vision of Jesus as described by Mrs B, a cancer patient undergoing radiotherapy, using her own narratives and painting of the vision; (2) a discussion of some possible psychological prerequisites of this experience; (3) a discussion of the psychological functions of this experience in a cop ing perspective when struggling with her cancer and how this experi ence has affected her religious life; (4) a critical discussion of research methods using narratives of religious experiences in the light of the results of the analysis undertaken in this study. Mrs B is one of the informants in an ongoing study about religiosity as coping mechanisms for Christians who practice their faith and have a form of cancer.' She was born in 1945 and at the time of the first interview session she is in the final phase of six weeks of radiotherapy designed to treat her cervical cancer without known metastases. Mrs B considers herself to be fully healthy except for her cervical cancer; she has no migraine, no epilepsy, and no known dam ages at the visual cortex or other neurological structures. The therapy takes place at the Linear Accelerator One, which is located at Norrland s University Hospital, Umeà, Sweden (see Fig. 2). She has rejected treatment with brachy therapy,2 and after one session with cytostatic therapy she refused further cyto static treatment. She has explained to her oncologist that she has her faith and that faith will be enough. She gives the impression of experiencing treatment as very unpleasant. She is afraid of needles and relates her intense dislike of a blood transfusion she had to undergo. On several occasions during the inter views she talks about her scepticism about medication. However, she accepts radiotherapy; the treatment does not make her feel uneasy during the sessions. Treatment with radiotherapy for cervical cancer normally takes 4 V2-6 weeks, usually with one session every day during weekdays and no treatment " The study is, at the moment of writing, in progress. Information can be found at: http://www. umu.se/religion/personal/mikael.lundmarlc/. 2) Sometimes known as sealed source radiotherapy, which is a form of radiotherapy where a radioactive source is placed inside or next to the organ or area requiring treatment.</page><page sequence="3">M. Lundmark /Archive for the Psychology of Religion 32 (2010) 27-68 29 during weekends. Depending on the general condition of the patient, she will be staying in an oncology ward or at a patients' hotel or, if the distance is not too far, at home. The radiotherapy session only takes a couple of minutes but every session has 15 minutes scheduled at the radiotherapy machine. The patient lies on a treatment bed and the staff adjust the parameters for the ses sion in accordance with the simulation that has been undertaken earlier. Then the staff leave the room, and the patient is monitored with cameras and micro phones. When the session is finished, the staff comes in again, adjusting the settings by rotating the head of the linear accelerator for a second and maybe third angle, etc. The side effects of the treatment usually show after approximately ten sessions and are most commonly diarrhoea and fatigue, but they often disap pear some weeks after completion of treatment (Onkologiskt centrum västra sjukvârdsregionen, 1999). The radiotherapy as such, is painless. No special light phenomena in the form of flashes, light beams or pulsating lights are visible during the treatment. There is a high frequency clicking sound that can be heard from the machine (Jetne, 2003, plus an interview with one staff member at the radiotherapy ward, 24 July 2007). The tissue that has been exposed to radiotherapy does not react with increased warmth or swelling dur ing the treatment session, although the exposed areas can be swollen or react in other ways after the treatment (Varre, 2003, Jetne, 2003). During the first interview with Mrs B about her life history, about her prayers and her use of religious literature and rituals,3 she relates a very clear vision of Jesus that she experienced about two-three weeks earlier during a radiotherapy session. It is obvious that this vision has been overwhelming for Mrs B, because she describes it as an experience of crucial importance and the happiest moment of her life. One year later a follow-up interview4 is carried 31 The first interview with Mrs B was carried out on 13 July 2006 and lasted for 97 minutes. It was conducted in Mrs Bs room at the patients' hotel, at the very end of these six weeks' treat ment, when she only had one or two sessions left. The interview protocol used was developed for the study: "Religiositet och cancer—En religionspsykologisk Studie av religiositetens funktion som copingmekanism hos cancersjuka praktiserande kristna" (Lundmark, in progress, English title: "Religiosity and cancer—A study in the psychology of religion about the function of relig iosity as coping mechanisms in practising Christians having cancer"). The first part of the inter view protocol is designed to get background information about the informant and to give substantial material for a narrative analysis. This part of the protocol is inspired by Dan R McAd ams suggestion of a life story interview (McAdams, 1993, see also Crossley, 2000). The second part of the interview protocol focused on the research questions of this particular study (the protocol can be found in Lundmark, in progress). 41 The second interview was conducted on 16 July 2007 and lasted for 54 minutes. It was con</page><page sequence="4">30 M. Lundmark I Archive for the Psychology of Religion 32 (2010) 27-68 out, focusing on this vision and its function from a coping perspective when dealing with her changed life situation due to cancer. The data for the analysis are (a) transcriptions of the two interviews and a short complementary telephone interview to clarify some things from the sec ond interview, (b) photographic documentation of the room where the linear accelerator is located, (c) Mrs B's own watercolour painting of the vision, and (d) an interview with a staff member at the radiotherapy ward who was work ing at the linear accelerator at the time when Mrs B was treated there. Mrs B's Own Narratives of her Vision Mrs B's vision of Jesus is narrated in two interviews conducted with an interval of one year. During both interviews Mrs B describes her vision, what actions and thoughts preceded the vision, and what feelings it generated. Because the narratives are not completely identical, the most important parts from both narratives are presented here. During the first interview, Mrs B describes her vision in the context of being asked to describe a peak experience in her life, something that she con siders to be the most wonderful moment in her life:5 well... if one says when one has felt really real happiness but mixed with some thing else, do you know what that was... that was maybe three weeks ago, about... I think... when I was lying at... the radiation... It is sensitive (tears starts to fall on her cheek)... I prayed for help and I thought I saw Jesus.. /' Like this he stood in front of me where I lay, like this I see him precisely in front of me over me and then I felt hap piness, and I felt precisely like... if you imagine he held his hands like this (holds her palms in front of her with the fingers pointing to the roof) it was like I felt his hands towards me, I felt precisely like it felt pleasant, precisely like if you say where I have the tumour. It was like it was touched somehow. It was also special so I can say that... it was probably more then, let us say, when I gave birth to the children or something, it ducted in Mrs B's home. The interview protocol followed was specially designed for this inter view occasion using a content analysis of the first interview. Both interviews were transcribed by the author. 51 Some notes on the codes in the transcriptions: One group of three dots means that Mrs B is pausing, trying to find the words or for other reason is quiet for some time. Two groups of three dots mean that text that is not significant at the moment has been deleted. If something happens which supports the understanding of the context, this is written in parentheses, for example if Mrs B is crying, pointing at something, accentuating something etc. The extracts from the inter views are modified to ensure Mrs B's anonymity and are translated from Swedish to English by the author. 6&gt; At this point, Mrs B walks away from the table and picks up a picture, she shows it to me, it is a watercolour painting of the vision of Jesus. See Fig. 1.</page><page sequence="5">M. Lundmark / Archive for the Psychology of Religion 32 (2010) 27-68 31 Fig. 1.

Lundmark / Archive for the Psychology of Religion 32 (2010) 27-68 was a completely different experience, a completely... like I have never experienced before... I have never felt like that before, never... Interviewer: How long did he stand in front of you? Mrs B: It was a couple of seconds, maybe a couple of seconds. Interviewer: In front of you. I will take the opportunity to describe it now so it will be on paper, it is a figure of Christ, who stands with his hands outstretched, he has a blue and red robe and there is a yellow light like an aura around his entire body. Mrs B: Closest to him it is white, closest to him there is light. Interviewer: Yes, and closest to the body there is light, it is white and he stands with his hands outstretched turned against... Mrs B: with his palms against me. Interviewer: With his palms against you... a very strong picture. Mrs B: Exactly, I didn't get the palms; they were not easy to paint. One year after the treatment was finished, a second interview is conducted. At this occasion there is not any known cancer in her body according to Mrs B. She has some side effects of the radiotherapy in the form of sudden bouts of diarrhoea. She gives the impression of being healthy and has gained ten extra kilos. Mrs B is asked to retell her experience of the vision of Jesus, as detailed as possible: It was during a radiotherapy session... and... I was lying watching because there was this clock. I lay and watched and suddenly I saw... yes, I knew immediately that it was Jesus... he had red and blue clothing, he was dark but he did not have black hair like I have painted him but he was dark but it was so light, so light, so light... a couple of metres around all of it. This table (referring to the treatment bed where the patient is lying) is so high, it is raised during the session so he must have been, he must have been floating in the air like... a bit from the floor to come... but he was high up and it was very, very, very light and there was also a light around his face and then he held his hands like this with the palms against me like this outstretched... It was only some seconds but it was so clear and so distinct and I felt that something happened. After wards I was almost convinced that I will get rid of that black Satan as I call it. Interviewer: Your cancer? Mrs B: Yes, precisely, I felt something happened Interviewer: You can conjure up the picture? Mrs B: Yes, precisely but not... not directly the face as I see your face I could discern a nose but not more. There was a light. Of this light around him it was like if the beams of light were directed against his face and then all the background also dis appeared. There was a window to where they sat (the staff) and a clock and then there was the wall. It all disappeared totally so it was only a light area there of a couple of meters, minimum... Interviewer: And he didn't say anything? Mrs B: No, I also thought about that but no... it. Yes, if you would have gotten any answer (laugh)... no... no he didn't say anything but he didn't have to.</page><page sequence="7">M. Landmark/Archive for the Psychology of Religion 32 (2010) 27-68 33 interviewer: There are people who have had visions. They tend to experience these visions in somewhat different ways and I have noted that... some experience visions as a very manifest figure who is physically present nearby... as a human who stands besides, whereas others can describe the vision as more of a picture they get inside their head that they experience that it all happens inside their head, but if I understand you right, Jesus was out there. Mrs B: I saw him, what you say about a picture inside one's head is like when I pray. I had my eyes wide open! Interviewer: When you think about this picture or this experience, this episode when Jesus revealed himself to you, what do you think? Mrs B: I think about that moment, because it was not more than a short moment I saw this. Interviewer: We are talking about two or three seconds, or? Mrs B: Say two or three seconds because I managed to see like this; that is what I remember... In the first interview, Mrs B describes the feelings that the vision generates inside her during and after the vision: It felt like some sort of reassurance, like a special confidence it felt like... I became warm... I felt happy, but I don't know if it was happiness, not in that sense Interviewer: I would like you to tell me about a turning point, an episode in your life where you went through a radical life change, altering your understanding of who you are. It is not necessary that you understood this as a life change when it happened but that you do so now, afterwards. Mrs B: That is hard (sighing)... that is there is one episode, which made me come to an insight that that is what I believe in... is the right way for me Interviewer: Now I will just say on the recorder here that you are pointing to the pic ture that you painted in connection to when you saw Jesus. Mrs B: Jesus, yes. In the second interview, she describes her feelings as follows: And I felt that something happened. Afterwards I was almost convinced that I will get rid of that black Satan as I call it. Interviewer: Your cancer? Mrs B: Yes, precisely, I felt something happened. Interviewer: Can you describe that feeling? Mrs B: Well, it is hard to describe that feeling, it felt like a warmth in the body, you don't feel any warmth in the body when you lie down and get radiation treatment, because it felt all the way up from the chest like this and it felt like a warmth and it was something that touched you in some way... it is very hard to describe! Interviewer: I would like to continue to talk about this vision. I would like you to try to tell me in as much detail as possible, the course of events around the vision, what</page><page sequence="8">34 M. Lundmark / Archive for the Psychology of Religion 32 (2010) 27-68 did you do earlier that day? Whom did you meet? Did something extraordinary hap pen that day? How was the day? Mrs B: It was a completely normal day... most of the time I had the radiotherapy sched uled before noon and I walked to get radiation and... no, it was a perfectly normal day. Nothing happened. I sat in the waiting room and was waiting for my turn and walked in, but then, afterwards, then when they had lowered this table so I could get down and dress and walk away then I actually sensed a warmth... felt warm... and tough. Interviewer: Tough? Mrs B: Yes, strong, I felt precisely like "damn, now they are going to see!" It was pre cisely as if I got an inner strength of some kind and I believe that it was what sustained me also later, because I didn't feel well there at the hotel and it was tedious too. Then I painted a picture of it. I thought I should paint it while I still remembered it well but that is no risk because I could paint it any number of times! I can see it in front of me; I only have to think about it.. .The entire background also disappeared at that time! There were windows to the office where the staff sat and a clock and the wall, it totally disappeared, so it was only a light area there for at least a couple of meters... so there is no risk that you will forget. During the first interview Mrs B is asked what preceded the event, what hap pened immediately before. I prayed for help and I thought I saw Jesus... Just before that, I did like always, I prayed that he should do so, with help from the human methods that... take away... Satan who was inside me, because I call it that and... I used to pray every time I was lying there but just this time then... I pray more or less the same every time but this time it was so strange so I had to paint him afterwards (referring to the watercolour that is on the table in front of us). It was when I lay on that treatment bed yes, and had that machine which beams underneath, on the side, above, on the side. Interviewer: And Jesus was standing at your feet? Mrs B: Yes. During the second interview Mrs B gives this different information: Interviewer: Can you describe that feeling? Mrs B: I didn't pray at that moment either, otherwise I used to pray when I was lying there that God should take away the evil when I was radiated... but I didn't do that. If I lay and thought about something I don't know, the picture just appeared just like science fiction... and that is what people—non believers—would take it to be, that it was a fictional. Interviewer: But you remember that you didn't think about anything particular. Mrs B: No, I didn't think about anything particular, he just appeared and that was what was so surprising. Yes, that was something that you have never... I can experi ence that any time if I just think about it.</page><page sequence="9">M. Lundmark / Archive for the Psychology of Religion 32 (2010) 27-68 35 A Comparison between the Two Narratives In the first interview Mrs B expresses herself more vaguely. She says, for exam ple, that she thought she saw Jesus whereas in the second interview she expresses a more confident position when she says: 'suddenly I see... yes, I knew imme diately that it was Jesus'. She is also more detailed during the second interview concerning what Jesus looked like. At the first interview she had already painted the watercolour of the vision and referred to it during the interview, at the second interview she modifies the picture by words when saying that 'he was dark but he did not have black hair like I have painted him, but he was dark'. In both interviews, Mrs B stresses that there was a light around Jesus and that he must have been "floating" in the air. The light was beaming against his face and the only part of his face that could be recognized was his nose (see Fig. 1). The pose of Jesus is also described similarly in both interviews. When it comes to the feelings generated by the vision, a comparison between the two narratives gives a high degree of conformity. In the first interview feel ings of security, warmth and happiness are described as well as an understand ing that what she has believed in is correct. In the second interview we find the feelings of warmth, the experience that something happens with the body and that this, whatever it is, it is a healing or the beginning of a healing. Further more she is feeling confident tough, "damn, now you are going to see!" and strong, feelings she attaches great importance to: 'it was that that sustained me later also'. Mrs B has a more apologetic tone in the second interview than in the first. She uses expressions that reveal a desire to defend her experience. For a year she has lived with the memory of the vision, talked, thought and probably processed the experience intellectually. The apologetic tone may be a reflection of this and probably also reflect the more precise subject of the second inter view, where focus is on the vision in particular. The most significant discrepancy between the two interviews is the context of the vision. In both interviews the general picture is that at the time of the vision everything was like it used to be, but in the first interview Mrs B says that 'I prayed for help and I thought I saw Jesus', whereas in the second inter view she emphasizes strongly that this particular time she did not pray, although she normally would do so. This discrepancy may raise the question as to whether Mrs B's accounts are reliable. Research about the psychology of witness testimonials shows that discrep ancies between accounts from the same witness over time may increase the</page><page sequence="10">36 M. Lundmark/Archive for the Psychology of Religion 32 (2010) 27-68 reasons to believe that he or she is trying to give a correct description of a true story.7 This supports the reliability of Mrs Bs narrative and that she is not tell ing a made up story. On the contrary she tries, from her memories, to describe an episode that she has experienced (Trankell, 2004). Even if the discrepancy between the two narratives does not give rise for us to question the overall reliability of Mrs B, we do have two sets of data that are differing on one essential point which has consequences for the analysis to come. Which of the two narratives is correct? The first interview took place a couple of weeks after the vision and is thereby much closer in time to the event than the second interview. If it is assumed that Mrs Bs memory has been less influenced by time and circumstances at the first interview then at the second interview, it can be argued that the first interview probably is closer to what actually happened (Trankell, 2004). People tend to normalize recollections of events over time. Memories become more conventional with respect to the general frame of reference. Therefore an early retelling of an event is more likely to give accurate informa tion then a later one, especially about an event that in some respects differs from the narrators sense of normality (Ashcraft, 1998). When people recall a memory they may be said to use scripts and default values. A script refers to knowledge about situations stored in memory and default values refer to typi cal events and details in a script. A memory of an event tends to follow the script and default values unless unscripted events occur within the event. If, for example, a person recalls a particular event of eating at a restaurant—given that she often goes to restaurants—she will tend to recall a generalized script representing this situation. She will remember how "it usually is" when eating in a restaurant (Ashcraft, 1998). However, it is also possible to argue that the second interview is closer to what actually happened. Mrs B used to pray before and during the treatments and if she didn't do that at the session in question, it would easily have become overlooked in her narrative, since prayers was a "default value" in Mrs B's "radiotherapy script". In the first interview Mrs B tells her story without being prepared to tell it, and she remembers the context of the vision in accordance with a generalized script representing the situation. In the second interview she is asked to retell the story about the vision and she puts effort into remem bering details. The fact that in this situation she remembers that she did not 71 This is especially the case if the changes in the testimonies are in accordance with changes that could be expected given what is known about the recollection processes (Trankell, 2004).</page><page sequence="11">M. Lundmark / Archive for the Psychology ofReligion 32 (2010) 27-68 37 pray, a detail that is not in accordance with the script, suggests that she actually did not pray on this occasion since her memory of not praying is contradicting the general script and therefore it is likely to be a memory of an actual event. Another argument that gives support for the version of the second interview is that with the second interview information is gained that can answer ques tions that the first interview cannot (which will be shown later). This informa tion is of a kind that hardly has any explanatory power for Mrs B herself in her efforts to understand the vision, and she does not gain much by changing the detail in her memory that she did not pray in connection with the radiother apy session when she experienced the vision of Jesus. We can, of course, never get a complete answer to the question about which of the two narratives is correct in the sense of whether she did or did not pray at the radiotherapy session in question. Here we have to make a choice, or let it remain an open question. In the analysis which follows both possibilities will be considered. Psychological Prerequisites When trying to analyze and explain the psychological prerequisites of Mrs B's vision of Jesus, two basic questions have to be addressed: (a) what are the psy chological prerequisites or origin mechanisms of the vision and (b) why is the gestalt in the vision attributed to Jesus. Possible Origin Mechanisms From a psychological point of view, it is plausible to regard religious visions as hallucinations or illusions. Whether Mrs B's vision of Jesus is a hallucination or an illusion can for now remain an open question. As a starting point in the discussion, let us however, assume that Mrs B is experiencing a hallucination. What is a hallucination? Hjalmar Sundén argues that it is not possible to draw clear boundaries between a real perception, an illusion and a hallucina tion. Sundén defines hallucinations as "perceptions where there are no estab lished stimuli present outside the organism that experiences the perception". Illusions are defined as "when one or several senses are stimulated from outside but the incoming impulses to the brain are fitted into the wrong pattern because one particular frame of reference has had an unusual high actuality" (Sunden, 1966). DSM-IV defines hallucination as "a sensory perception that has the compelling sense of reality of a true perception but that occurs without</page><page sequence="12">38 M. Lundmark / Archive for the Psychology ofReligion 32 (2010) 27-68 external stimulation of the relevant sensory organ".8 In agreement with Sun dén, we can suggest that the distinction between hallucination and illusion is vague, since it in most cases of hallucinations, it is difficult to rule out totally the possibility of external stimuli as a source of the perception. Religious visions are not as unusual as might be assumed (Hay, 1979, Holm, 1982, Geels, 1991, Wiebe 1997) and the phenomenon is to be seen in con nection with other known facts: at least every tenth individual has on one or more occasion during his or her life experienced a hallucination. A study by Tien of the prevalence of hallucinations in the USA shows that between 11 and 13 per cent of the population in USA have at one time experienced a hal lucination (DSM-III-R criteria for hallucinations have been used here) (Tien, 1991). There is also a documented connection between life crisis and religious experience (Hay, 1982, Spilka &amp; Mcintosh, 1995). Still, a survey through Swedish and English collections of case studies (Geels, 1991, Geels, 1989, Wiebe, 1997), popular collections of documented visions of Jesus (Sparrow, 1995) or relevant databases,9 found no documentation of visions in the con text of interventions for physical diseases, for example through chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgical interventions etc.10 The exception to this observation are studies about the experiences of inten sive care patients during full or partial sedation, where it is noted that halluci nations are not rare (Rundshagen et al, 2002, Roberts &amp; Chaboyer, 2004, Margery &amp; McCutcheon, 2005). In those studies all informants are—to a various degree—drugged. Combinations of drug induced sedation and misin terpretation of stimuli is the starting point of the theoretical arguments of these studies. In contrast, Mrs B was not drugged during the radiotherapy ses sion when she experienced her vision of Jesus. It might be argued that near death experiences are forms of hallucination connected to medical interventions. This may be true, but this type of experi ences is excluded here. Most likely, they have other origin mechanisms than visions, such as lack of oxygen (Greyson, 2000). When building a psychological model of the vision as a hallucination, according to Richard P. Bentall, we need to consider cultural influences (above "&gt; American Psychiatric Association, 1994. A more detailed and illuminated discussion of defi nitions of the concept hallucination is given by Wiebe (1997) in his discussion of neurophysio logic explanations of visions of Jesus. " Search done 14 august 2007, keywords: "religious", "vision", "apparition" , "Christ", "Jesus", "hallucination" in different combinations in the following databases: psycINFO, psycARTI CLES, pubmed, Social Abstracts, web of science. "" No claims are made here to have done a complete review on this topic.</page><page sequence="13">M. Landmark / Archive for the Psychology of Religion 32 (2010) 27-68 39 all on faith and expectations), the degree of stress in the person experiencing the hallucination, and the surrounding stimuli (Bentall, 2000). It is also likely that biological factors play an important role here (D'Aquili &amp; Newberg, 1999, Trobe, 2001). Hallucinations are generally trigged by migraine, epilep tic cortical activities or damages in the visual cortex and illusions from aber rant visual processing (Trobe, 2001). It must be stressed that what Bentall says about visions of Christ as hallucination is likely to also be true about visions of Christ as illusions (Bentall also considers external stimulus as a possible source for hallucinations). The mental processes which let us know if an experience occurs from our internal world (fantasies, dreams, etc.) or from the external world (experiences generated by other agents than ourselves) are called source monitoring. The ability to distinguish between self-generated internal events and externally generated events can, like other abilities, sometimes fail (Bentall, 2000). Peo ple use different kinds of cues to separate between self generated memories and memories of "real" events. Contextual information about place and time can help the person to determine whether an event is real or imagined. Other cues can be the degree of vividness in the memory, complexity and wealth of details as well as coherence and probability. An example of this is if an individual remembers that she performed an act that violated the laws of nature, she may conclude that it most likely was a dream or fantasy (Bentall, 2000). Mrs B experiences the vision as very real indeed. She emphasizes that she saw Jesus Standing there and that she had her eyes wide-open. Here several cues about coherence and probability might indicate to Mrs B that this is an experience with internal origin: the gestalt is "floating" in the air, the gestalt is suddenly present and disappears as mystically as it appears, and the gestalt has a strange and very strong light around it. Against this, however, there are sev eral cues that speak of external origin: the vividness and complexity of the vision, especially concerning the robe of the gestalt (one may, however, note that the light beams inward against the face of the gestalt so that only the nose is visible), and Mrs B experiences herself as totally awake. For Mrs B those latter cues seem to be dominant, since she classifies the origin of the vision as external. When considering cultural influences in the attempts to explain the vision, the so-called role theory can be a plausible analytic tool. In role theory, phase switching is an essential concept meaning that an individual goes from a secu lar reference system to a religious or vice versa. This is what occurs when a religious person enters a room in which other expectations than those outside the room are dominant, for example a church. The probability of experiencing</page><page sequence="14">40 M. Lundmark I Archive for the Psychology of Religion 32 (2010) 27-68 a religious vision increases when a phase switching from a secular point of view to a religious one has occurred. One way of undergoing such phase switching is through prayer (Sundén, 1966). All kinds of prayers" are likely to facilitate a phase switching but it seems most likely during meditative prayers (Poloma &amp;C Gallup, 1991).12 With all kinds of prayers we find cognitive structures acti vated with a specific content, usually conceptions about a god who listens to prayers and a possibility to get answers to those prayers (Lindgren, 2001). What immediately precedes the vision according to the first interview is that Mrs B has been praying to God "... I prayed for help and I thought I saw Jesus...' and as an answer to the question about what had preceded this event, what happened just before: ... Just before that I did like always, I prayed that he should do so, with help from the human methods, that... take away... Satan who was inside me, because I call it that and... I used to pray every time 1 was lying there... The information in the second interview is different concerning one thing: at the time of the vision she did not pray, which she usually did. If she prayed at the time of the vision, there is a strong support for an assumption that cog nitive structures were activated that involve a gestalt that Mrs B associates with her childhoods security, above all the security which was mediated through her grandmother (relevant information about Mrs Bs childhood and adult life as well as the grandmother and other important people in Mrs Bs life will be given in a section below). Mrs B relates her favourite hymn, which has followed her during her life and to which she often listens. It is called "Let Me Hear about Jesus". The hymn's second verse can be translated in the following, non-poetic way: Tell me again and again, how on our earth he walked around, tempted, despised and humble, owning nothing for himself. My sins he carried, the pain he took upon himself, Poloma &amp; Gallup (1991) distinguish between four different kinds of prayers: ritual prayer, conversational prayer, petitive prayer and meditative prayer. I2) Poloma &amp; Gallup (1991) have shown that individuals who mostly use meditative prayers more often report mystical experiences then individuals with other kinds of dominant prayer patterns.

Lundmark / Archive for the Psychology ofReligion 32 (2010) 27-68 41 ready to heal and help, ready to sacrifice himself,13 Jesus walked around on the earth (which means that he can presumably reveal himself) and he is ready to heal and help. This set of ideas is part of Mrs Bs religious frame of reference and is here assumed to be activated by—among other things—her prayer. Even if she did not pray prior to the vision one can argue that religious cognitive structures are activated because she used to pray during the radio therapy sessions, even if she didn't pray at this particular occasion. Even if prayers did not precede the vision, the very presence in a room where Mrs B usually prays could in itself facilitate a phase switching by which a vision of Jesus becomes a possibility. The cultural setting plays a major role in the understanding of why some people attribute the occurrence of internal events to an external causes (hal lucinations), whereas others attribute internal events to an internal cause (fan tasy or dream), or the other way around, that some people attribute external events to an internal cause (for instance refuse to believe their own eyes). This is likely to be true for illusions as well. A person who grows up in a society where spiritual experiences and visions are seen as a reality is more likely to attribute a visual perception to an external context, than an individual who has grown up in a materialistic atheistic home (Bentall, 2000). This also makes sense applying role theory. Religious experiences are possible only if the indi vidual has knowledge about a specific religious tradition and associated roles (Sundén, 1966). In a cultural situation where visions are seen as a reality, where there is a frame of references with detailed religious roles, and where the bearers of those roles have visions, it is—psychologically speaking—possible to understand experiences (with internal or external origin) as visions and to attribute visions to some external factor, such as God (for a more detailed discussion of role theory and visions, see Geels, 1989). Stress and triggering of emotions affect the attribution process or source monitoring (Bentall, 2000). The connection between different kinds of dis tress and religious experience is documented in several studies. Hay has shown that 50 of 100 British adults who had had religious experiences reported that prior to the experience they had been in some sort of distress. Most frequently they worried about the risk for their own or close relatives' death (Hay, 1982). 13) 'Swedish Songbook for Sunday School for Home and Schools', hymn no. 69, authors translation.</page><page sequence="16">42 M. Lundmark /Archive for the Psychology of Religion 32 (2010) 27-68 Mrs B is more or less under stress during the entire radiotherapy. The ses sions mean a daily peak of this stress. The room in which the radiotherapy takes place is often connected with a wide range of strong feelings (Jettne, 2003). The cancer disease with its merciless dual exit is manifest in this room where the "battle for her life" takes place. A room so obviously existentially loaded is likely, like a church, to be a place where a phase switching easily takes place.14 Continuing to follow Bentall's scheme in order to try to understand Mrs Bs vision, one must consider if there were surrounding stimuli which are consid ered of importance when trying to understand attributions of internal and external experiences to the internal or external world. In conditions when external stimuli are diminished because of sensory restrictions or monotone background noise it is more likely that the individuals will falsely attribute inner experiences to outer sources (Bentall, 2000). Depravation tank studies, where the subjects are shielded from basically all forms of external sensory stimulations show that—even if hallucinations are rare under those circum stances—the human brain produces a lot of inner images that are easily pro jected to what the subject might perceive as an outer reality (Spilka, Hood, Hunsberger &amp; Gorsuch, 2003). An image in this sense is the information left when the perception has occurred. All larger sensory systems generate sets or systems of images that later can be activated by electrical, mechanical, chemi cal or psychological stimulation (Horowitz, 1975). Horowitz describes this as a dual-input model of image formation. Image creating and perception share some neural processes. Under normal circumstances, people can easily mix internal and external signals when the external signals are vague and ambigu ous. An experience of a hallucination takes place, according to him, when information with internal and external origins are mixed (Horowitz, 1975). Can diminished external stimulus be an explanation of the vision? Mrs B is not subjected to sensory restrictions during the sessions, which only last a few minutes. Her stay at the patients' hotel during the six weeks of treatment is however to some extent a sensory restriction. She considered herself being inadequately stimulated during this period and therefore felt bad while staying at the patients' hotel. Whether this kind of sensory restriction can contribute to the appearance of a vision is questionable (in the discussion which follows it will, however, be argued that there is a strong reduction of the normal flow I4) For a discussion and comparison of other visions of Jesus connected to stress, see Geels, 1989.</page><page sequence="17">M. Lundmark / Archive for the Psychology of Religion 32 (2010) 27-68 43 of stimulus during this particular radiotherapy session when Mrs B experi ences the vision of Jesus). Are there any external stimuli that can help explain the origin of Mrs B's vision? As a matter of fact there are. Jesus wears a red and blue robe, has a yel low aura of light around him and a light beam towards his face. Mrs B says that she has always imagined that Jesus would wear white clothes which is the way she sees him when, after the episode of the vision, she wants to call forth a mental picture of Jesus. Why Jesus wears this colourful robe during the vision she cannot explain; she finds it strange. When looking at Fig. 2 and comparing it with the picture of Jesus from Mrs B's watercolour (Fig. 1) one can see that the colours of the yellow wall match the yellow light surrounding Jesus. The display in front of Mrs B, when lying on the bed and looking down in the direction against her feet, in level with her eyes, is silver-grey. Depend ing on how the lights fall at the display, it gets a nuance of blue, not so differ ent from the bluish-grey colour of the robe. The red colour on the same robe matches the lit red numbers on the display. The light sources in the room are the fluorescent tubes under the ceiling and on the wall to the right of the dis play. They are usually lit all day, as can be seen on Fig. 2.15 The scale of the colours in the vision and the light sources are already situated in the room when the session begins. One may also note the similarity in form between on one hand the gestalt in the watercolour and on the other the display with the cameras on the left and right side and the cylinder above the display. The arms of Jesus that are stretched out are to the body of Jesus what the cameras at the sides of the display are to the display. Furthermore, the form and position of the cylinder above the display is to the display what the head of Jesus is to his body. From this we can conclude that what Mrs B experiences here is, in psychologically terms, an illusion, that is, she misinterprets or makes an alter native interpretation of the stimuli she experiences: she has a vision of a gestalt. To sum up, a psychological model for explanation of Mrs B's vision, built on Bentall's scheme and not taking into account the discrepancy between Mrs B's two narratives could look like this: At the time when Mrs B experienced the vision, she had gone through a phase switching, or to use Sundén's phras ing: a certain frame of reference had an unusual high actuality. The phase switching was activated by prayer and/or presence in an existentially loaded room (the radiotherapy room). She might even have taken the role of her grandmother and/or other persons in the Pentecostal setting that she had 15) Interview (25 July 2007) with one staff member at the radiotherapy ward that worked at the linear accelerator on the day Mrs B experienced the vision of Jesus.</page><page sequence="18">44 M. Lundmark / Archive for the Psychology ofReligion 32 (2010) 27-68 recently become more acquainted with, and where such themes as "Jesus is a reality", "Jesus listens to prayers", "Jesus answer prayers, can help" etc. are vivid. There are external stimuli that with respect to colour, light, and form match the gestalt Mrs B has painted. It is thus plausible to assume that, in psychological terms, the vision is an illusion rather than a hallucination. The incoming impulses (the display with its red and silver-grey-blue colours, the yellow wall, the light reflected on the wall, the position of the cameras and the cylinder in relation to the display) are combined into an alternative pattern. Why Mrs B sees this alternative pattern at this particular time and not dur ing other radiotherapy sessions is an open question. Assumable, the frame of reference in question could have been activated at other occasions during radiotherapy. One detail in Mrs B's narrative can contribute to answering this question. There are reasons to believe that the radiotherapy sessions for Mrs B have psy chological similarities to a meditation session. The clock, Mrs B refers to as the one she was always laying and watching at during the sessions, is actually a digital display.16 Mrs B's focusing on the display is, psychologically speaking, similar to focusing on a given object in a meditation session. According to Jan van der Lans, all meditation has four common features (Van der Lans, 1980, see also Geels &amp; Wikström, 1999): (1) A bodily relaxation and an immobile posture. Mrs B is lying absolutely still on the treatment bed during the radio therapy session and is probably also relaxed (except perhaps during the first sessions when the entire procedure is new and probably frightening); (2) A considerable reduction of the normal flow of stimulus due to focus of atten tion to one single object. Mrs B focuses on the display during the radiotherapy sessions; (3) A monotonous over stimulation of a particular cognitive struc ture. The display that Mrs B focuses on would in this very moment occupy her entire consciousness. Here it is relevant to compare with Deikman et al.'s experimental study about meditation without a religious context. The subjects in their study were meditating over a specific object (a blue vase). After a rather short time the participants in the study experienced that the object became alive and shining, which Deikman et al explain as a consequence of a transi tion from an active cognitive style to a receptive cognitive style (Deikman, 1966, 1971). An active cognitive style is characterized by a consciousness that From the photographic documentation of the room in which the vision took place it is evi dent that there is no clock in the room. In a short telephone interview with Mrs B 2007.10.18 it is confirmed that the clock to which she refers and which she used to watch during the radio therapy in reality is this display.</page><page sequence="19">M. Lundmark /Archive for the Psychology of Religion 32 (2010) 27-68 45 is directed towards processing information from the surroundings, whereas a receptive cognitive style is characterized by being receptive to the surround ings (which is a goal or prerequisite for meditation); (4) Activating of the religious reference system that the person meditating is familiar with. Mrs B's religious frame of reference is, as shown above, activated during the radio therapy sessions. But why did Mrs B change from an active cognitive style to a receptive cognitive style at this (and presumably only this) radiotherapy session? The answer could be found in that Mrs B's praying style is verbal and the assump tion that Mrs B did not pray during this particular session. A verbal praying style where the praying person in question prays in concrete words (as opposed to for example glossolalia or meditative prayers) implies an activating of cogni tive structures associated with, among many others, problem solving and other active mental processing (Deikman, 1966, 1971). Since Mrs B, for reasons we do not know, at this particular session did not pray though she used to do so and did not, as far as she could remember, think about anything in particular, it can be assumed that the prerequisites for a switch from an active to a percep tive cognitive style are present. Similar psychological mechanisms to medita tion are thus being activated at this very session but not at the sessions when she prayed. However, the fact that Mrs B did not pray at this particular ses sion, does not mean that the religious frames of references are not being acti vated. As noted earlier, the radiotherapy room is existentially loaded for her and it is a place where she usually prays, which might very well be enough to activate religious frames of references. Why is it Jesus She Sees? In the first interview Mrs B says that she thought she saw Jesus and in the second interview she says she knew immediately that it was Jesus. This discrep ancy in the narratives probably reflects a growing assurance that it was Jesus she had seen. That conviction has so to speak become fixed during the year that has elapsed. Probably, it has been growing while Mrs B is reading about Jesus, praying to him, talking about him and in her thoughts dealing with the memory of the vision. This is consistent with other studies of visions. Assur ance of who the person in the vision is grows when dealing with the memory of the vision over time.17 17) A good example is offered by Michel P. Carroll (1986) in his discussion of Bernadette Soubi rou's visions of Our Lady of Lourdes.</page><page sequence="20">46 M. Lundmark / Archive for the Psychology ofReligion 32 (2010) 27-68 In the second interview, the following question is asked "you are saying that it was Jesus, why don't you think it was an angel or God?" Mrs B answers: Angel... no... I was convinced it was Jesus... it struck me directly there when I was laying that... it was Jesus who came, not any angel, or no, not God. God and Jesus are the same in my opinion. Jesus is the embodiment of God and the more I read 1 believe this is the case. The cultural influences and personal dispositions, formed not only by the cul ture but also by interaction with other people during the earliest years, are two important components in the attribution process (Freud, 1961, Carroll, 1986). We have already made some role-theoretical considerations when dis cussing origin mechanisms of the vision. What can be said about why Mrs B saw Jesus in her vision from the perspective of this theory? Given that we know Mrs B attributes the vision to Jesus, the question is what role-taking can it be plausible to assume Mrs B did took on when she anticipated Jesus in a role-adoption? Since Mrs B up to the time of the vision was not much of a bible reader, it is less likely that an eventual role-taking could be associated with a biblical figure. It is more likely that a role-taking should be related to significant others in her life. The importance of her grandmother is very clear in several passages in Mrs Bs narratives. She grew up with her mother and her grandmother but since her mother was working, it was her grandmother who took care of Mrs B much of the time during her childhood. Nothing is ever mentioned about her father. When asked to tell about one of the worst episodes in her life, she answers that she has had many terrible experiences, but after some consider ation she decides that the worst experience was when her grandmother died, at which time Mrs B was 25 years old. Other significant persons in her life were some friends of her grandmother, her aunt, the wife of a former mission ary from the neighbourhood, and later in life a female colleague who was also a believer. The overall analysis of the narratives gives reason to believe that the missionary and the female Christian colleagues husband were also important persons in her life. The only men she mentions in the context of her childhood and adolescence are the missionary and her aunts husband. Mrs Bs grand mother seems to be the person who more than anyone else played a role in shaping Mrs Bs religiosity. She was also the one who took Mrs B to the Pen tecostal church and its children's activities. The grandmother seems to have had a very sincere and devoted relationship to Jesus and was from time to time very active in the Pentecostal movement (above all as she grew older). In that</page><page sequence="21">M. Lundmark I Archive for the Psychology of Religion 32 (2010) 27-68 47 movement, charismatic practices and connected experiences such as glossolalia and prophecy are frequent (Holm, 1976) and religious visions are regarded as something positive (Burges &amp; van der Maas, 2002).18 From what we know about significant others in Mrs Bs life, it is thus plausible to assume that the attribution of the vision, in a role-theoretical perspective, probably has to do with adopting the role of her grandmother in connection with which a role adoption of Jesus may have occurred. I will now change perspective and look at the question from a psychody namic point of view. When Freud discusses religious hallucinations he puts forward two hypothesises: (a) this kind of experience functions as a mecha nism for revealing surplus sexual energy and (b) the content in these hallucina tions is formed by the persons desire to fulfil unconscious wishes (Freud, 1961, Carroll, 1986). This theoretical position is also found in modern psychodynamic studies of religious hallucinations and visions (for example Carroll, 1986), but it is by no means universally accepted (Wiebe, 1997). According to Wiebe "the claim that repressed sexual impulses find their expres sion in apparitions is evidently an attempt to identify the key causal element, but one is left wondering why it is that repressed impulses are expressed as apparitions' (Wiebe, 1997, p. 191, italics in original). On the other hand, I find it a reasonable hypothesis that the content of an experience could be formed by a desire to fulfil unconscious or—for that matter—conscious wishes. From a psychodynamic perspective it is a plausible hypothesis that Mrs Bs vision is in its content formed by one or several unconscious or con scious wishes. If it is assumed that Mrs B, at the moment of the vision, was in a receptive cognitive style, as discussed above, a plausible explanation of why Mrs B sees Jesus in the vision can be constructed. The capacity for a receptive cognitive style to actualize repressed conflicts and tensions is well documented in other studies and is an important explanatory model in attempts to psychologically understand mystical experiences in connection to meditation (Geels &amp; Wik ström, 1999). When Mrs B is in a receptive cognitive style, her mental func tions of pattern finding move to an alternative pattern finding, that in form and colour resembles the display and its surroundings. This alternative pattern finding answers a specific uplift from the subconscious, taking the shape of a 1S) It has not been possible to ascertain whether the congregations in which her grandmother participated were settings in which glossolalia, prophecy and visions were actually prevalent or not.</page><page sequence="22">48 M. Lundmark / Archive for the Psychology of Religion 32 (2010) 27-68 Christ figure who is associated with some more or less unconscious conflicts and sets of problems in Mrs B s life, and, in the same time, I suggest, with solutions to these conflicts and sets of problems. As far as the transcribed material permits, an attempt will be made to estab lish what unconscious and/or conscious wishes are at stake and, related to that, what repressed conflicts, tensions or set of problems that could be related to a Jesus figure in such a way that a vision of Jesus could be a plausible visual manifestation of contents from the subconscious. One set of problem here is of course Mrs B s cancer, that she also calls Satan. By calling the cancer Satan, Mrs B gives expression to an anthropomorphic way of thinking. Satan becomes a personification of the cancer itself. Here we find an important brick in our building of a model for understanding why she saw Jesus instead of for example God or an angel—Who is the antagonist to Satan but Jesus? In the light of Mrs B's religious background, it is not surpris ing that it is Jesus she sees in a vision in a room where the battle between good and evil, between sick and healthy, between life and death is taking place. If Satan stands for the cancer, then Jesus stands for healing, or the defeat of Satan. Jesus becomes the doctor who cures Mrs B, ready to heal and help, as sung in Mrs B's favourite hymn. Another set of problems that could shed some light on a Jesus figure (under stood as a plausible visual manifestation of contents from the subconscious) is Mrs B's relationships with the men in her life. Mrs B relates an idyllic childhood. She was the only child and had no cous ins. She describes herself as a spoiled child, a cherished child. She says that she did not know what evil was and expected only good in those she met. Eco nomically she was in a good position. As a child she had a manifest belief in God. Jesus played an important role. She participated in children's activities in the local Pentecostal congregation, which she often visited with her grand mother. She prayed regularly and at least at one occasion she also experienced an answer to her prayer. It is clear that she lacked a father figure during her childhood and adoles cence. When Mrs B talks about the men in her life she has mainly negative memories. She met her first husband who also is the father of her seven chil dren when she was 18 years old. 'When I was eighteen years old I met my first husband and... then... then I had child after child after child so I have seven children and I can say that my life was good until I was eighteen.' The years with this husband became troublesome, above all economically, but also when it came to workload. The husband seemed to have no sense of economics and also had an obvious unwillingness to work hard, in spite of the fact that they</page><page sequence="23">M. Lundmark / Archive for the Psychology of Religion 32 (2010) 27-68 49 had a farm. A short time after the last child was born Mrs B left her husband: 'then I moved. I took seven kids, I took five horses, I took one cow, two sheep and moved to a house in the vicinity of XXX, and then life became calm and peaceful'. After some time Mrs B met an immigrant and married him in order to, as she puts it, 'help him to get a permanent residence permit, because at that time I felt pity for those who came' (strong emphasis on "at that time"). The relationship was good for the first two years but then, as she expresses it, his true reappeared in the form of greed, exploitation of Mrs B and some of her children as free labour in his business, and psychological torture of Mrs B. She leaves this man under dramatic circumstances, and after that she experi ences some peace again. She meets her third husband and she has seven happy years with him when he suddenly dies of a heart attack. For economic reasons she is then forced to sell their house. The only man mentioned with directly positive words in her narratives is the missionary whom she has known since childhood. He and his wife are described as pious, such good examples of how people should be. The narratives of Mrs B show a striking lack of male models during her adolescence. Jesus is present in her life during this period through the activities in the Pentecostal congregation and its youth work, as well as through her grandmother's piety and an experience of an answer to a prayer directed to Jesus. Mrs B's experience of the encounters with men during her adult years up to her late forties is negative. Those men also restrain her freedom to wor ship. She talks about her longing for a home altar and a crucifix that has never been met during that time. Her two first husbands have never allowed her to have such things. The third husband is different but he dies suddenly about four years before the discovery of her cancer. The interest in Jesus increases some years after the third (good) husband's death. It is not unreasonable to assume that Jesus represents a compensation for a non-present father during her childhood and adolescence as well as a compensation for the good husband who apparently stands in contrast to the previous husbands. Furthermore, one may assume that Jesus symbolizes an antithesis to the two first husbands. When worshipping Jesus the longing for a crucifix and a home alter, denied by the two first husbands, can be fulfilled. Thus she can reclaim some of the freedom she has been denied during a great part of her adult life. The return of Jesus in Mrs B's life some year prior to her cancer can be seen as an expression of a distancing from those parts of her life that she has not been happy with, from men in general and from the two first husbands in particular. Jesus may constitute an unconscious compensatory mechanism for a lack of good experiences with males in her life.</page><page sequence="24">50 M. Lundmark I Archive for the Psychology of Religion 32 (2010) 27-68 To sum up: From a psychodynamic perspective, the vision of Jesus can be understood as an expression of an actualization from the subconscious repre senting wishes, conflicts and sets of problems in Mrs Bs life. More precisely, the vision of Jesus seems to relate to two different sets of problems in Mrs B's life. One is her lack of good experiences with males during major periods of her life. When related to this set of problems, Jesus could be seen as a compen sation for the lack of a father figure, the opposite of the bad husbands in her life and a compensation for the third, good husband. The other set of prob lems is related to her wish for health and life. Here Jesus could be seen as the antagonist to Satan, the cancer, and as such the healer or curer of the cancer, the doctor. Psychological Functions of the Vision When trying to understand the psychological functions of the vision of Jesus, a content analysis of Mrs B's narratives leads to two, partly related, groups of functions, (a) how the vision influences Mrs B's religious worship and (b) the role of the vision in the process of coping with cancer. Influence of the Vision on Religious Worship Mrs B's religious worship has been changed by the vision. Her faith has been strengthened ('my faith wasn't that strong during my entire life'), her praying habits have been intensified and a conviction that God can help and that Jesus exists has become stronger. In the second interview, Mrs B answers the ques tion "what has the vision meant for you this last year?" Oh, it has followed me every day, I think about it almost every day, and because of that... because previously I didn't pray every evening but I do that now, it must be because he proved to me that he exists... that is my opinion, I take it as a... He has helped me all the time after that, I have prayed for help with a lot of things, I have had animals who have been sick... the dog was sick... two cats that I thought I had to put to death but... I prayed for help and actually the funny thing was that I waited as long as I could. I have my medicine cabinet for them but I waited as long as I could but then I saw that no, this is not going to work and then I prayed to Jesus for help and... already the day after, the cats felt better and the same thing with the dog. There are more things... where in my opinion I have been helped... faith can move mountains they say... Mrs B reads the Bible more often now. She used to read only the Christmas gospel, Proverbs and Song of Songs. Now she reads the Bible from cover to</page><page sequence="25">M. Landmark I Archive for the Psychology of Religion 32 (2010) 27-68 51 cover. On the whole she experiences that her relationship with God has become stronger and more intense. When it comes to her relationship with God after she grew up, she describes herself as a seeker. There was a short period in her thirties when she doubted the existence of God, thoughts that for her were related to the problem of theodicy. It is only the last years that she experiences that her relationship with God has become more intense, even if she says she has prayed to God her entire life. She has found Jesus quite recently; it was only a few months prior to her cancer diagnosis that she started to pray to Jesus. As an answer to the question about how she feels when she prays Mrs B says: it is hard to describe how you can say that you feel, I feel warm... it feels warm and pleasant... maybe it is because I like warmth that I find it pleasant, yes it is delightful, it feels, you feel.. ..confidence... and I think I feel more... more close, closer to God, closer to Jesus... As already mentioned, her praying style could be characterized as verbal. She says in the first interview that she talks in her prayer through thoughts or spo ken words. To the question why she addresses her prayers nowadays to Jesus instead of God she says that It is like I imagine that I get double power it feels easier to address Jesus than God. When I pray to God I feel like you have to watch yourself what you say, so you choose the right words, it is more solemn, like if you talked to the king or the crown princess, but no, it is easier to go through Jesus somehow... When Mrs B started to think more about Jesus, which happened in September or October the year preceding the first interview, she started to go to the local Pentecostal congregation that she earlier had an ambiguous attitude to. She relates in the first interview that as a human being I had to have someone to go to... If you go to the Pentecostals then it is Jesus Jesus Jesus; that irritated me... I had God... it was something I learned by myself, I must say, to learn about this... but it was there, and it felt good. I will go more to the Pentecostals from now. And so she did, according to the second interview. In the second interview Mrs B tells that during the year that has gone from the first interview, she has attended an alpha class (introduction course in Christian faith) run by the Pentecostal congregation. She has intensified her own study of the Bible, first and foremost with the aim to become able to give</page><page sequence="26">52 M. Lundmark / Archive for the Psychology ofReligion 32 (2010) 27-68 answers to the people in her neighbourhood with whom she nowadays dis cusses religion. One obvious difference in Mrs Bs religious practice at the time of the second interview as compared to the first is her degree of outspokenness. She often returns to the theme of evangelizing, to speak about her faith to oth ers, something she says she never dared to do before her vision. Her prayer activities have also changed. It has become more intensive and it has changed character. Nowadays she prays every day, which has not been the case earlier, and she has started to visualize Jesus when she prays. Interestingly, it is not the picture from the vision she visualizes but Jesus dressed in white squatting, a pose that Mrs B interprets as Jesus is listening to her. Mrs B interprets the meaning of the vision: '...if it may have been his intention that I should tell people... but why he showed himself... was it so I should understand better?...' For Mrs B the vision is on the one hand a sort of proof of the existence of God, that God is active, and on the other hand an appeal that she should tell people about God, to teach. Mrs B is above all eager to debate creationism versus Big Bang theory and Darwinism. She tries to explain in order to help others and she seems generally to have become more outspoken: 'I stand for the whole thing now'. The vision has obviously changed Mrs B's religious life. If we choose to see the vision as a result of the crisis she goes through, it is plausible that the crisis as such has had a changing effect on Mrs B's religious life and behaviour, in accordance with Ruard Ganzevoort's assumption that crises has a changing effect on faith (Ganzevoort 1998a, 1998b). On the other hand, it is possible to assert that the experience of a vision is an extraordinary phenomenon and even if, psychologically speaking, it has its origin in the crisis, it is not the crisis as such that has had the changing effects on Mrs B's religious life but this extraordinary experience (compare with for example, Geels, 1989, Geels, 1991, Geels &amp; Wikström, 1999, Pahnke, 1966, Doblin, 1991 for some evi dences of the changing effects of extraordinary (mystical) experiences on life in general and religious life in particular). The Vision and the Coping Process Kenneth Pargament defines coping as a search for significance in times of stress, significance being whatever is important for an individual, for an insti tution or for a culture. He sees a connection between religion and coping. Religion is defined as a process, a search for significance through ways related to the sacred. Pargament's scheme for different comprehensive coping models provides a basic tool for classifications of coping methods and a base for under</page><page sequence="27">M. Lundmark I Archive for the Psychology of Religion 32 (2010) 27-68 53 standing the functions of different types of coping activities (Pargament, 1997).19 The vision of Mrs B has different functions in the process of coping with her cancer. First and foremost it has generally strengthened her relationship with God. The vision has meant a confirmation of her belief. Furthermore, for at least the second time in her life she has experienced an answer to a prayer; Mrs B feels that she has been healed by Jesus during the vision "... he healed me there, with the modern resources we have today, he gave a helping hand there and somehow turned (the course of events) I got that feeling, I'm con vinced about it'. To use Pargament's typology of coping models, the vision functions as a preserving mechanism for what is significant, that in this con text for Mrs B is above all two things: her frame of reference (her world view, her faith) and her survival. The vision confirms Mrs B's experience that God continues to help her with whatever she asks him, for example her pets' dis eases. This confirmation of the power of God increases her faith in God and confidence in living in fellowship with God. One way to put this is to say that the vision functions as a catalyst for other religious coping mechanisms. Parts of her religious behaviour, like her peti tionary prayers, have been an important coping mechanism already before the vision. Similarly, religious support from the congregation and significant oth ers as well as reading the Bible and religious song texts are being reinforced as coping mechanisms after the vision. Ruard Ganzevoort presents a multidimensional model for understanding religious coping. Four processes (religion, identity, context and coping) develop all the time and interact with each other (Ganzevoort, 1998a).20 To be able to identify the specific influence of religion in coping, according to Ganzevoort, From his assumption that all people search for significance and that religious coping is about the choice between conservation or transformation of the significant, Pargament sketches four comprehensive coping models: (1) preservation of both means and ends of the significant; the individual tries to hold on to what he or she has and cares about, (2) reconstruction; the ends are the same but new means have to be found in order to reach these ends, (3) Re-valuation; a trans formation of ends but a preservation of means, (4) re-creation; a total transformation of both the means and ends of the significant. (Pargament, 1997) 201 According to Ganzevoort, Pargament insufficiendy focuses how crises and coping influence religion. Pargament considers religion as a fixed system, according to Ganzevoort, not as a dynamic process which changes over time and which is influenced by life events. Furthermore Pargament, according to Ganzevoort, does not pays enough attention to identity processes and context processes. Ganzevoort argues that such processes both influence and become influenced by religion and coping (Ganzevoort 1998a, 1998b).</page><page sequence="28">54 M. Lundmark I Archive for the Psychology of Religion 32 (2010) 27-68 a multiphase perspective has to be adopted. Religion is seen as a biographical process that includes all aspects of human life (Ganzevoort, 1998a, 1998b). Ganzevoort discusses three dimensions of religious coping in and around the coping process: (1) religious experience, (2) religious interpretation, and (3) religious behaviour. When it comes to the first dimension, (1) religious experience, positive influence primarily comes from experiences of religious support in the form of strength, consolation and relief (Ganzevoort 1998a). This is expressed in Mrs Bs narratives; she experiences that God is not only listening to prayers but answers them as well. It is an experience from her childhood and onwards, strengthened by the vision and the perceived heeling or start of a healing pro cess which Mrs B attributes to her vision of Jesus. This is probably also rein forced by her pets' recoveries. An example of this is seen when Mrs B walks out of the radiotherapy room after her vision: she feels an inner strength and "tough": damn, now you are going to see! She attaches a decisive importance to the inner strength she has got in the aftermath of the treatment, when she has come home again. When it comes to (2) religious interpretation Ganzevoort claims that a reli gious interpretation of an event only can take place within a religious frame of reference. Religion provides a set of possible interpretations of events and situ ations (Ganzevoort 1998a). Mrs B experiences something warm in her lower abdomen in connection with the vision. This warmth is given a religious inter pretation. Mrs B connects it to the vision and more precisely to Jesus' out stretched palms over her lower abdomen. The warmth becomes a physical manifestation of a healing that, in her perception, occurs or starts during the vision. Another event given religious interpretation is the lack of known relapse of her cancer one year after the radiotherapy, at the time of the second inter view. This lack of relapse is interpreted by Mrs B as an intervention from God and as an answer to her prayers. Religious interpretation contributes, according to Ganzevoort, also to feel ings of having control and of self confidence, two important positive factors in crisis management. Mrs B's religiosity affects her choices during the treatment period. She refuses to continue chemotherapy with the motivation that she has her faith and that is enough. That Mrs B accepts the radiotherapy might seem strange given that she believed that a healing took place or started during the vision, but there are several passages in the interview material that support the conclusion that Mrs B sees God's intervention in her cancer as a collabora tion with the human medical interventions or that God intervenes through human medical interventions. Therefore she chooses to carry on with the</page><page sequence="29">M. Lundmark / Archive for the Psychology of Religion 32 (2010) 27-68 55 entire radiotherapy treatment, which, after all, contrary to the chemotherapy, does not give any noticeable or severe physical side effects. (She is afraid of needles and has from the very beginning refused treatment with brachyther apy. Together with narratives about scepticism about medicine in general this shows Mrs B as very sensitive to interventions to her body). In terms of "locus of control", that is, whether the control is located with God (Pargament uses the term 'deferring coping style') or is kept with Mrs B (self-directing coping style), she takes a middle position and keeps some of the control in her own hand, in spite of the perceived intervention from God. Mrs B and God share the responsibility in the handling of her cancer (collaborative coping style). She doesn't let the whole course of events into God's hands but retains a cer tain autonomy.21 The autonomy can be connected to the observation that the vision contributes to a feeling of self confidence. She says that she felt tough directly after the vision when she left the radiotherapy treatment room and she thought damn, now you are going to see! (3) Religious behaviour, according to Ganzevoort, is the third dimension of religion which can influence coping. Apart from participating in church activ ities it is above all the promotion of a positive and healthy life style that con tributes to coping with and prevention of crises (Ganzevoort, 1998a). In the case of Mrs B, the vision has an invigorating effect on her religious behaviour, which in turn functions as coping mechanisms for her. It should however be acknowledged that her decision to refrain from chemotherapy, being reli giously grounded, could be something that in medical terms increases the risk of not being cured. In this respect religious motivated behaviour could, in the case of Mrs B, also be contradictory to a healing process, and more generally to a healthy life. Switching the perspective and looking at the influence of crises and coping on religion, we find that according to Ganzevoort, it has a changing or stimu lating effect on faith (Ganzevoort, 1998a). This is supported by other studies, for example, Torbjornsen et al. who show that persons who get cancer often change faith within the frames of their religiosity. Theists in particular tend to become more religious (Torbjornsen et al., 2000). Mrs Bs religious life, and more precisely her practise of religion in different ways, is, as already shown, intensified after the vision. So if the vision is seen as a result of the crisis, the crisis has a stimulating effect on Mrs B's religiosity. Depending on a positive or negative outcome of the coping Ganzevoort claims that it either strengthens or weakens religious behaviour. Positive outcomes For a more substantial discussion of different coping styles, see Pargament, 1997.</page><page sequence="30">56 M. Lundmark / Archive for the Psychology ofReligion 32 (2010) 27-68 of religious coping activities strengthen the sense that religion has a value to the individual and can be interpreted as a gift from God and a sign that faith is an important part in the overall coping with the difficulties of life. A nega tive outcome can give an impression that religion does not have a value and tends to block faith development and experience (Ganzevoort, 1998a). The vision is a manifestation of a healing for Mrs B. The fact that one year after completion of radiotherapy she is unaware of any metastases or relapses of the disease, confirms her assumption that what happened during the vision was indeed a healing. Therefore it has a strengthening effect on her religious behav iour, in accordance with Ganzevoort's assumption. Whether her faith would have been weakened if she became sick again is an open question.22 During the second interview, Mrs B was asked if she knew the prognosis for her disease: I didn't get any information at all, it was only to hope. Now when I was (at a medical checkup) in March, the doctor who was there said that at least he couldn't find any thing. There was nothing, so he thought it looked like bright prospects... I saw many relapses when I was there (at the patient hotel, during the radiotherapy period) and which ones were that? It was the breast cancer which comes everywhere you know... I think I had been more afraid then but what do you know?... Interviewer: What do you mean when you say "what do you know"? Mrs B: I think like this: has it been there once, so... maybe it comes back easily again. I think like this, it takes five years before you are declared cured. I know people who have been cancer-free for five years and then have got cancer again later, but it can wait several years, so maybe it has nothing to do with it (the first type of cancer)... but it can come back again, you never know... but I don't care, because in my opinion... I have got... exemption... for life... Mrs B compares her diagnosis with breast cancer. She has seen that those who relapse are mostly those with breast cancer. Here we have an example of another type of coping mechanism not directly connected to Mrs B's religious frame of references. Her reasoning seems to be connected to "it could have been worse". At least she doesn't have breast cancer, and her own observations tell her that those with breast cancer are most likely to relapse. Up to this point we have mostly been focusing on the worldview or religious frame of refer ences as the significance. Here we find another significant factor: survival. Naturally these two are closely interrelated. Coping mechanisms designed pri marily to preserve a threatened world view could also be of help in coping with 221 A criticism of Ganzevoort's assumption that negative outcome of religious coping should have a weakening effect on religious behaviour is offered by Lundmark, 2002.</page><page sequence="31">M. Lundmark / Archive for the Psychology ofReligion 32 (2010) 27-68 57 a threat of death. When Mrs B prays, it is, from a coping perspective, a coping mechanism designed to deal with threats to her religious world view as well as to her life as such. Her conviction that her prayers have been answered when Jesus shows himself to her, serves as a preserving mechanism of both kinds. She is convinced that she is cured or on her way to become cured, and so her life is preserved and a great deal of psychical stress is eliminated. Another example of how the religious coping mechanisms can have a pre serving function is her wish to talk about certain aspects of her religiosity with other people. This evangelizing attitude becomes a way to fill her days with meaningful activities. It keeps her occupied and focus is taken from poten tially negative speculations about the uncertain future to more constructive activities while at the same time maintaining her religious world view. She says that she doesn't care if the cancer comes back because she has already received an exemption in her life. She has already gotten extra time from God and is pleased with that. In coping with an uncertain future, the perceived gift from God in terms of extra time becomes important. In the first interview, Mrs B relates what she would do if she knew that she only had a limited time to live. During the second interview that question is introduced once more. Mrs B: No, I think I have got a year now which I have received as a gift; but have I looked after that gift? No, I have not. Interviewer; No? Mrs B: No, I haven't done what I should. If I had (extra) time... maybe I would have done something in between but I haven't done that. I have taken every day as usual, cleaning up among my things and giving the children that which has some value, because if I'm going to die I will not have them argue about anything, I have seven children living all the way down to XXX so... no, I have not, I said I wanted to live in a chalet with animals. &lt; Interviewer: You did tell me. Mrs B: (laughing) I would have loved to do that, but in my opinion I'm of no use because I can't carry heavy stuff or anything; but I know how to milk cows, and cheese and that kind of thing... no I haven't taken care of this year... so probably I hope for some more... that's that. Mrs B reckons that she has gotten extra time from God. She reasons: if she had received extra time, a limited time with a "to-be-used-before-date" so- to speak, then maybe she would have been more active during the last year. Because she hasn't been particularly active, however, she concludes that she is hoping for more time. The extra time Mrs B perceives she has gotten from God is important in her coping with the uncertain future. This extra time</page><page sequence="32">58 M. Lundmark / Archive for the Psychology of Religion 32 (2010) 27-68 should have been used for certain tasks (she says that she hasn't taken care of this time but taken every day as usual) and the fact that she still hasn't taken care of those tasks gives her hope that God will add more time to her life. To sum up: the picture we get of Mrs B's vision of Jesus from a coping per spective is that the vision has positive effects. Her frame of reference contains religious components which also function as coping mechanisms and which are strengthened by the vision (first and foremost prayer and reading the Bible). A new component has emerged: she has a more evangelizing attitude after than before the vision. Intensified prayers, reading of the Bible, conversa tions with other people about certain aspects of her religiosity, all seem to function as preserving coping mechanisms for what is significant, first and foremost her religious frame of reference or world view, but also her survival. Methodological Considerations In the analysis regarding the psychological prerequisites of Mrs B's vision of Jesus, several theories from varying psychological traditions have been used, mainly perceptual-, social- and psychodynamic traditions. The importance of integrating different psychological models in order to facilitate analysis of the type of phenomena discussed here has been emphasised before (Geels, 1989). Psychological traditions can obviously, as the present study is an example of, complement each other. It is evident from the previous discussions of the possible origin mecha nisms to the vision, that Mrs B's two narratives have a high degree of corre spondence, which is encouraging. That gives reason to believe that the human memory—is reliable over a period of one year, at least when it comes to life changing events. On one significant point, however, the narratives differ which results in different conclusions in the analyses depending on whether informa tion from the first or the second interview is used. When it comes to our understanding of the psychological function of the vision from a coping per spective, the discrepancy between the two narratives has little or no signifi cance. But attempting to understand or explain the psychological prerequisites of the vision, however, the discrepancy is important. Following the first narra tive, the information supports a social psychological and/or perceptual psy chological model of explanation of the origin of the vision. At the same time nothing can be said about why Mrs B experiences the vision exactly at this radiotherapy session. Following the second narrative, a model of explanation</page><page sequence="33">M. Lundmark / Archive for the Psychology of Religion 32 (2010) 27-68 59 can be constructed that also explains why Mrs B had the vision at this particu lar time. From a methodological point of view, this points at an obvious weakness in studies where data are collected at one occasion with in-depth interviews which raises some questions: In data collections with only one interview, what is lost or left out? What kind of research questions is purposeful to ask to a narrated material and what kind of analysis is meaningful to do given the uncertainty of the accuracy in the collected data? To further illustrate the problem of accuracy in collected data, let us turn to the study by Wiebe on degrees of hallucination and Christie visions (Wiebe, 2004) that in methodological terms is close to the present study.23 Wiebe uses 21 factors to compare experiences of Christie visions, in order to create a continuum between lifelikeness and hallucinatoriness. The factors are divided into four main categories: (a) ordinary consciousness, (b) volitional elements, (c) perceptual elements and (d) spatio-temporal-causal effects. Wiebe com pares three visionaries' experiences in order to establish the extent of aberrance in the experience as a way to judge the degree of lifelikeness and/or hallucina toriness in the experiences. If Mrs B had been an informant in Wiebe's study a comparison between the two narratives would result in an identical set of codings when checking the narratives for all except one of the 21 factors. The factor in question is one of the volitional elements which he calls "no indirect causes". As an example of volitional elements, Wiebe mentions the methods to reach mystical experiences for which certain saints and mystics are well-known, such as self-inflected pain, fasting and sensory deprivation. An act of meditation qualifies as a volitional element in this sense. The psy chological effects of being in a situation similar to a meditation act, of the kind Mrs B found herself in, could qualify as an indirect cause of volitional type.24 The information from the first interview gives no reason to believe that there is any indirect causes of volitional type. The situation when Mrs B is lying on the treatment bed receiving radiotherapy is similar to a meditation act, but i3) Wiebe has the same kind of research objects, that is, he is investigating experiences of Christie visions, and his methodology is close to the one used in this study in the sense that he uses inter views to gain data. The interviews are conducted at one single occasion though each informant is given the opportunity to read the transcription, resulting in small revisions of the transcripts (Wiebe, 2004, mail correspondence with Wiebe 29 January 2008). 24) Whether it is accurate or not to classify the item "no indirect cause" as "volitional" is not discussed here. It might be better to give the item "no indirect causes" the status of main category in itself.</page><page sequence="34">60 M. Lundmark ! Archive for the Psychology of Religion 32 (2010) 27-68 since this similarity appears to be in place more or less at every radiotherapy session we have no reason to believe that the similarity to a meditation act causes the vision. The second interview, however, gives reasons to believe that there are indirect causes of volitional type to the vision. Following Wiebe's argument about the degree of lifelikeness and/or hallucinations, the informa tion from the first interview would put Mrs Bs experience closer to the life likeness on the lifelikeness-hallucinatoriness continuum and the information from the second interview—closer to the hallucinatoriness. In other words, the results differ depending on whether information from the first or second interview is used.25 A design with only one data collection is more or less problematic depend ing on what the research is about. Psychology of religion attempting to explain (in terms of cause and events) with only one data collection may—from the viewpoint of Mrs Bs double narrative—be under critique. Psychology of reli gion attempting to understand is not to the same degree vulnerable to that kind of criticism. I am of course well aware, also because of my own research, that often and for many reasons, it is hard or even impossible to collect data from the same informant on several occasions in narrative research. (And even when this is possible, two harmonious recollections of the same event is no guarantee that the recollection is correct.) One common strategy to deal with this is to let the informant read the transcription and correct eventual "mistakes" in the narra tion. This is however, in my opinion, a questionable way of validation since an additional narration of an event on the informants behalf, means yet one more step into a fixation of a certain set of default values in a given script for that informant. A reading of the transcript of the narration would likely fur ther fixate this particular set of default values and strengthen a certain version of the memory of the event and is by no means a certain validation that the narration is in accordance with what actually happened. This consideration is not meant as a criticism of the narrative methodology as such but rather to raise questions of self-criticism and awareness of the fragility of the data col lected through narrative research. It is important not to assign too much 251 Possibly, Wiebe has turned the scale wrong in the items grouped under volitional elements. A "yes" on the item "no indirect causes" or "no act of the will" according to him would mean more lifelikeness then a "no". In my opinion, however, the degree of lifelikeness would increase if the vision was somehow self-caused by actions directly designed to evoke a mystical experience, or actions not designed to evoke mystical experiences but that anyway increase the likeliness to evoke a mystical experience.</page><page sequence="35">M. Landmark/Archive for the Psychology of Religion 32 (2010) 27-68 61 certainty to the results from analysis of these kinds of data, especially when the issue is to explain a phenomenon. The analyses in this study also raise another, but related, question: When is the best time to conduct an interview that focuses on a life-changing event? As soon as possible after the event: in order to eliminate effects of lapses in mem ory caused by time, or when some time has elapsed and the life-changing event so to speak has settled down in the informant's life and started to give effects on the life events in general, and when the event has become an integrated part of the general narrative constructions of the informant? This question must, I believe, be answered in the light of the research questions asked. It would seem that it is better to collect interview data about the psychological function of a religious event at a time when the event has become an integrated part of the informants life and his or hers narrative structures. Conversely, information designed to describe the actual event, what "really" happened, is better col lected as soon as possible after the event. A final note about Mrs B's two contradictory narratives: the information from the first narrative may differ from the information in the second because of the two interviews' differing foci. In the second interview Mrs B had put more effort in getting accuracy in the narratives about the vision, since she knew that it was the vision that was at the centre of interest. In the first inter view she told the story more briefly and as the answer to another question. The briefly mentioned information about the context of the vision came from a memory that was highly influenced by a generalized "radiotherapy script". In the second interview she made efforts to recall possible discrepancies between the context of that particular radiotherapy session and all other radiotherapy sessions. This underlines an important issue that appears self-evident but is nevertheless in my opinion less often noted—the information in the narratives has to be seen against the question that has triggered the answers. This is espe cially relevant when it comes to secondary analysis of narratives not initially collected to answer the research questions of the secondary analysis. The infor mation from the first narrative (that Mrs B had been praying) must be evalu ated against Mrs B's agenda: the narrative of the vision is an answer to the interviewer's question about what was the most wonderful event in her life. For her the question of the circumstances around the vision's context is less important. Contrary to the first interview, the information in the second interview (that she did not pray) is an answer to the interviewer's questions about the context of the vision, in an interview focusing exclusively on the vision. The rule "as the question so the answer", applies to narrative research as well.</page><page sequence="36">62 M. Landmark I Archive for the Psychology of Religion 32 (2010) 27-68 Conclusions and Final Remarks An attempt to understand a vision is a delicate task. The analysis depends to a great extent on the point of view taken. Theologically, a vision could be under stood as an expression of the revelation of God; psychologically, it could be understood as a hallucination or an illusion with a wide range of possible ori gins. A theological perspective does not exclude a psychological perspective and vice versa.26 It is clear that in most cases of experienced visions, the vision has been of great significance for the visionary. There is a rich literature, both academic, popular and not the least in the mystic traditions, that points to how the life of visionaries have changed because of the visions. (Geels, 1989, Geels, 1991, Geels &amp; Wikström, 1999). Possible origin mechanisms of Mrs B s vision have been discussed. From a cognitive perspective it is clear that the vision takes its building blocks from the interior of the room in which the radiotherapy sessions take place. Evi dently, there is a set of external stimuli that matches Mrs B s vision. That leads to the conclusion that the vision is not a hallucination but an illusion (adher ing to Sundén's definitions of the concepts). From a cognitive point of view Mrs B makes an alternative interpretation of the stimuli she experiences every day at the radiotherapy sessions: a display with surrounding cameras and cyl inder becomes a Christie figure. There are plausible explanations why Mrs B makes this alternative interpre tation of the stimuli. One model of explanation is that she has gone through a phase switching, meaning that some cognitive structures that fit a Christie vision are activated. This activation occurs because she is in a room that is "existentially loaded" for her since this is the place where she receives the radiotherapy against the tumour that threatens to take her life. Furthermore, if the first narrative is correct, this activation occurs because Mrs B has been praying prior to the vision. If the second narrative is correct, the activation occurs because she has had a habit of praying before and during the therapy sessions. In order to answer the question "why Mrs B experienced the vision at this particular occasion?" yet another model of explanation has been discussed. The model is based on the striking resemblance between Mrs Bs situation dur ing the radiotherapy session and an act of meditation, and also in the assump tion that Mrs B did not pray in connection to the radiotherapy session in question. The key to the possible transition from an active cognitive state of 261 For discussions on this topic see: D'Aquili &amp; Newberg (1999), especially part 3 and Spilka, Hood, Hunsberger &amp; Gorsuch (2003), chapter 10.</page><page sequence="37">M. Lundmark /Archive for the Psychology of Religion 32 (2010) 27-68 63 mind to a receptive cognitive state of mind is, paradoxically, that she at the radiotherapy session in question did not pray. Mrs B's praying style is verbal and therefore connected to cognitive structures associated with problem solv ing and other, active more than receptive, psychic processes. Thus her prayer would preclude a transition to a receptive cognitive style, which is often iden tified as a prerequisite for mystical experiences. If it is true that Mrs B did not pray during the radiotherapy session in question (for reasons we do not know), although she usually did so, this points at an important psychological differ ence between this particular radiotherapy session and all the other. Such a difference may constitute what is necessary for the therapy session to influence Mrs B the way an act of meditation would do. A transition from an active cognitive state of mind to a receptive one, an over stimulation of one specific cognitive structure (associated with the display), an under stimulation of all other cognitive structures, and a maintained religious frame of reference makes it possible for Mrs B's mental pattern finding mechanisms to identify an alter native pattern to the stimulus experienced in the room during the radiother apy session, namely a classic Christ figure and hence: the vision of Jesus. Some tentative explanations of why Mrs B attributes the vision to Jesus are given. Besides a possible role-taking of the grandmother and a connected role adoption of Jesus, it is noted that Jesus some time before the diagnosis of the cancer has had a renaissance in Mrs B's life. She has started to pray to Jesus and is frequently participating in activities in the local Pentecostal congregation. It is also noted that there is a lack of male models during childhood and adoles cence and there are mostly negative experiences with men in adulthood. The vision of Jesus can be understood as a specific uplift or an expression of an actualization from her subconscious representing wishes, conflicts and sets of problems in Mrs B's life. Two such sets of problem have been identified. One is her lack of good experiences with males during big parts of her life. When related to this set of problems, Jesus could be seen as a compensation for the lack of a father figure, the opposite of the bad husbands in her life and a compensation for the third, good husband. The other set of problems is related to her wish for health and life. Here Jesus could be seen as the antagonist to Satan, the cancer, and as such the healer or curer of the cancer, the doctor. Wiebe raises the question about the extent to which Christie visions reflect, rather then cause, religious commitment (Wiebe, 2004). In the case of Mrs B the answer would be—a bit of both! Her own religious commitment is reflected in the vision but the vision also causes a stronger religious commitment in her life: the faith has been strengthened, the prayers become more intensive in booth nature and frequency and a conviction has been formed inside her that</page><page sequence="38">64 M. Lund.ma.rk /Archivefor the Psychology of Religion 32 (2010) 27-68 Jesus exists and that God can help. The reading of the Bible is also intensified and she has engaged in active evangelizing more than before the vision. In the context of coping with the cancer and her changed life situation, the vision, first and foremost, has had a catalyzing effect on other religious activi ties, such as prayer and bible reading that in turn function as coping mecha nisms. Mrs B experienced during the vision that she got healed or that the process of healing started, something she sees as an answer to her prayers. After the treatment she perceived some more answers to her prayers. That increased her trust in the power of God and confidence in living in a relationship with God. So, finally—did Mrs B actually meet Jesus during the radiotherapy session? The present study is an attempt to deconstruct a Christie vision, using tools of perceptual psychology, social psychology and psychodynamic theories. Fur ther, it has been shown that the vision has a psychological function in its impact on changing behaviour and in coping with the cancer disease. By doing this, has Jesus disappeared? I have earlier indicated that I, personally, do not think so. I have in this study discussed "immanent" models of explanations but none of them rules out the possibility of "transcendent" models of expla nations.27 One such model, that in my opinion makes justice to both the results of this study and Mrs Bs own religious frame of references, takes its starting point in the "immanent" models of explanations I earlier discussed but interprets those as expressions for, metaphorically speaking, the 'theatrical properties' of God's revelation to Mrs B. Starting in Mrs B's perceptions, through her synapses, chemo-electrical systems, in her pattern-searching and corresponding pattern-finding, in an eventual role-taking and role-adoption and possible also in her reactions on the perceived vision, we can see the strokes 271 A "transcendent" explanation of Mrs B's experience presupposes that God, somehow, causally affects material processes. Although this idea is controversial, it does not necessarily imply that any "miracles" (in the sense of events that violate natural laws) must take place. Arthur Peacocke argues that God can act in a way which respects natural laws through a so-called top-down cau sality. God's influence on material processes would, according to this account, be similar to the influence of the whole upon the parts. For instance, holistic features of an ecological environ ment can causally affect the DNA of the organisms that make up the environment. (Peacocke, 1993). If we imagine that God is the "environment" in which the world exists, it might be pos sible to picture divine causality in an analogous way. John Polkinghome, physicist and theolo gian, has proposed another model, based on chaos theory, which also allows us to understand divine action as compatible with the integrity of the laws of nature. Other models have also been proposed, such as the idea that God acts at the level of indeterminate quantum processes. (Polk inghome, 1998)</page><page sequence="39">M. Landmark / Archive for the Psychology of Religion 32 (2010) 27-68 65 of the brush of God, we can see God's handwriting in his or her revelation, in the communication with Mrs B. St. Paul says in the Acts: For in him we live and move and have our being (Acts 17:28, NIV), if this is taken to be valid, we could say that the opposite also is valid: for in us he lives and moves and have his being. To say the least, it is undoubtedly the case that it is through our perceptions, that become a reality for us inside our brain that we can experience that God lives and moves and has a being. We can obviously never answer that question whether Mrs B actually met Jesus. Here we finally end up in belief; personally I believe that during the radiotherapy session Mrs B might have met Jesus. However, what is immensely more important than my or anyone else's opinions or beliefs in this matter, is that Mrs B believes she met Jesus. Yes, more than that: Mrs B knows she met Jesus, and that makes the whole difference... hence, the title: 'When Mrs B met Jesus during Radiotherapy'.
