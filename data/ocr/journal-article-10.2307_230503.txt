<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES &amp; CORRESPONDENCE VICO AND THE CONTINUITY OF SCIENCE: THE RELATION OF HIS EPISTEMOLOGY TO BACON AND HOBBES By Jeffrey Barnouw* In his two main early works, De nostri temporis studiorum ratione (1709) and De antiquissima Italorum sapientia (1710), Giambattista Vico presented a cri- tique of the Cartesian foundation of science in "clear and distinct ideas"; he proposed a contrary criterion, the verum factum, which eventually provided the basis for his own "new science." This has often been interpreted as the renewal of an orientation proper to humanistic learning and the civil-prudential tradition in resistance to the encroachment of methods and modes of thought which are supposedly appropriate only to the natural sciences. But Vico's development, rightly understood, rather supports the view that the "new science" of the seven- teenth century, from Galileo on, provided the crucial inspiration and model for the formation of the human sciences and thus effected a fundamental break with humanistic and prudential orientations. A careful reading of Vico's early works reveals a deep commitment to the continuity of science.' Vico's opposition to Cartesianism was not meant to limit the natural-scientific approach to knowledge or question its value as a model for sciences of the historical and civil world. In the first place, Vico does not regard Descartes's proposed foundation of science as the sole authoritative such foundation in his time, as many of his commentators do. He does not grant the Cartesian ap- proach validity in its own sphere and then argue for separate but equal status for a complementary idea of "human science." He meets Descartes on his own ground and disputes his conception of science, even as applied to mathematical physics, and he proposes a divergent conception which itself has roots in the non-Cartesian philosophy of the scientific revolution, above all that of Francis Bacon and Thomas Hobbes. In the second place, like Bacon and Hobbes (and Descartes2), Vico claims that his conception of science, derived from the mathematical, constructive, and experimental "natural science" of the preceding century, can be carried over into the study of socially and historically constituted realities. He recognizes the "continuity of science" as a shared intellectual commitment that links the tri- umph of the "new science" in the 1600s to the emergence of sciences of the man-made world. This historical continuity of motivation or scientific attitude means that one branch of science can borrow prestige as well as particular ap- proaches and methods from another branch, and that, even when the branches are to be differentiated one from the other as to their methods, the common commitment to science as a distinct way of knowledge (as opposed to humanistic *Department of Modem Foreign Languages and Literatures, Boston University, Boston, Massa- chusetts 02215.

For the continuity of science also concerns the coherence of the culture. I. THE LINKING OF OPERATIO AND RATIO IN BACON AND HOBBES In different but essentially related ways, Bacon and Hobbes supported the con- ception of science as a knowledge of (and by way of) efficient or productive causes by grounding it in an active initiative mode of experience.3 This they contrasted to a passive mode associated with naive induction, custom, and pru- dence. Active experience is focused and formalized in experiment but has a broader potential range, for it encompasses the various forms of social practice otherwise governed by tradition and authority. It was through criticizing the tacit practical framework of prevailing modes of knowledge that Bacon and Hobbes argued for the basic importance and broad scope of the new science for human life generally. By integrating the mathematical and the empirical, what is known with cer- tainty and what is known through experience, modern science undermined an ontological distinction that had been essential to the classical idea of scientia. The separation of a sphere of being where things were what they were by neces- sity and thus could be known in their essence and necessarily, from a sphere of contingency, chance, and change, where knowledge depended on custom and conjecture and never reached beyond probability, was overridden in the scienti- fic revolution by the idea that the gap between opinion, authority, or "proba- bility" and knowledge-through-insight was not ontologically grounded and could be overcome by attention to method.4 For Bacon and Hobbes the key to the new method was its deliberate orienta- tion of thought to operation. One whose knowledge is based in passive experi- ence is restricted to inference from given appearances or effects to possible causes and tied to past experience in framing an idea of what is possible. One whose knowledge is geared to operation is in a position to conclude from causes within one's control to their effects and thus achieve certainty-rational necessity-and acquire a new sense of possibility. Not only did the new method thereby make experience-as undertaken rather than undergone-relevant to questions of rational knowledge; it also made rationality newly relevant to human practice, complementing the critique of prudence. In the Preface to the Great Instauration Bacon writes that the received logic, or dialectic, is "properly applied to civil business and to those arts which rest in discourse and opinion," but "is not nearly subtle enough to deal with nature." This would seem to imply that Bacon provided for a division of labor between the old organon and the new, defending the emergent natural sciences from the encroachment of an established method appropriate only to moral and civil matters. But in the Proem Bacon claims that his Instauration would be "a total reconstruction of sciences, arts, and all human knowledge, raised upon proper foundations. "5 3The continuity of orientation from Bacon to Hobbes has rarely been recognized.

The distinction is epistemological, not ontological, and implies not only that the old logic is deficient but also that a progression is possible from opinion to knowledge, in whatever field of inquiry. The decisive difference between the two logics is that Bacon refers science to operation. His logic, unlike the old, leads to the "invention not of arguments but of arts, . . . not of probable reasons, but of designations and directions for works." "In dealing with the nature of things [natura reruml I use induction throughout," he writes, "that form of demonstration which ... comes to the very brink of operation, if it does not actually deal with it." Bacon's new form of induction will "analyse experience and take it to pieces, and by a due process of exclusion and rejec- tion lead to an inevitable conclusion," so that his approach only establishes provisionally certain degrees of assurance for use and relief until the mind shall arrive at a knowledge of causes in which it can rest."S6 To be able to demonstrate knowledge of causes requires having undertaken an active initiative investigation of them. As the famous third aphorism of the New Organon puts it, "Human knowledge and human power meet in one.... that which in contemplation is as the cause is in operation as the rule." Bacon affirms the "position that 'true knowledge is knowledge by causes,"' and asserts that the important causes are not the immediate efficient and material causes, but what he misleadingly calls "formal causes" or "forms": "For though in nature nothing really exists besides individual bodies, performing pure individual acts according to a fixed law, yet in philosophy this very law, and the investi- gation, discovery, and explanation of it, is the foundation as well of knowledge as of operation. And it is this law with its clauses that I mean when I speak of forms." Interpretation of Bacon has suffered from general ignorance, or ignor- ing, of the rational element of his logic of science grounded in operatio.7 While Bacon was critical of a "topical" orientation (from the classical topica or commonplace arguments of Aristotle), which like "dialectic" is tied to opin- ions, he thought that "topics" might play a subordinate role in the experimental pursuit of scientific knowledge. This adaptation of the ancients' correlation of topica with invention as a preliminary to judgment (critica) was taken over by Vico, who suggested that topical (positive, given) and critical (rational, truth- oriented) were interrelated elements within every branch of science. This is quite different from the idea often mistakenly attributed to him, that topica and critica characterize separate branches of knowledge. Redefining the function of orientation to topoi or commonplaces is part of a new conception of knowledge, one that emphasizes continuous development from the reliance on custom, opinion, authority, appearances, and probability to scientific knowledge. Thomas Hobbes presented a critique of prudence as part of his conception of science and justified the extension of science into the moral, legal, and political sphere, but he also recognized the fundamental importance of what he called "prudence" in a broad sense, as the natural mode and matrix of experience. According to Hobbes's analysis of his early work, Human Nature, experience begins with the perception that certain appearances succeed or accompany others, which leads us instinctively to take the one as a sign of the other. Hobbes emphasizes that such "natural signs" are only "conjectural," "their 'Works of Francis Bacon, Vol. IV, pp. 24-25, 32. 7Francis Bacon, Novum Organum, Bk. I, Aphorism 3; Bk. II, Aphorism 2 (Works of Francis Bacon, Vol. IV, pp. 47, 119-120).</page><page sequence="4">612 JEFFREY BARNOUW assurance is. . . never full and evident." The gap between science and "this taking of signs by experience" or "conjecture from experience" which is pru- dence, is that "experience concludeth nothing universally." Universality, which distinguishes science, is a property not of things but of terms or, more properly, of propositions. Accordingly Hobbes sees science as based in a distinct sort of experience, the "experience men have from the proper use of names in lan- guage." This "knowledge of the truth of propositions, ... derived from under- standing," is later crucial to Vico's early conception of science.8 Hobbes here construes the transition from prudence to science in terms of the integration of artificial sign relations into the positive (and conjecturally ex- tended) knowledge of natural sign relations. Science combines the truth that is proper to propositions, or the relations of terms, with "evidence" or a grasp of the meaning of terms that is rooted ultimately in sense experience. In this sense science can be defined as "evidence of truth, from some beginning or principle of sense: for the truth of a proposition is never evident, until we conceive the meaning of the words or terms whereof it consisteth, which are always concep- tions of the mind: nor can we remember those conceptions without the thing that produced the same by our senses." As "evidence of truth," science (also referred to here as "sapience" or "wisdom") is accordingly contrasted with prudence, now defined as "experience of fact," but the former is also necessarily based in the latter. As Hobbes writes in Leviathan, the use of artificial signs and the unequivocal understanding of them make it possible to "turn the reckoning of the consequences of things imagined in the mind, into a reckoning of the consequences of appellations," or rational knowledge.9 The passive and past-oriented character of prudence can at the same time be transformed by active initiative. The "natural sign" relations which are taken from or by experience remain conjectural because they involve inferred causal connections. Hobbes contrasts the inference from given effect to possible (con- jectural) cause with the contrary way of concluding from cause to possible (producible) effect, and thus construes the transition from prudence to science in ter-ms of a rotation of the causal axis presupposed by experience, so as to bring about a conscious correlation of cause-and-effect with means-and-end relations. Being able to reorient experience from a prudential to an experimental cast gives us the insight into causality (causes within our power) that founds a knowledge no longer conjectural, but demonstrative, necessary, and universal.'0 The operational conception of science converges with the conception of science as "evidence of truth"-the rational understanding of propositions whose mean- ing is secured by conventional (agreed upon) definition-when Hobbes explains that reason is not "born with us; nor gotten by experience only, as prudence is; but attained by industry; first in apt imposing of names; and secondly by getting a good and orderly method" to reckon consequences. "Science is the knowledge of consequences, and dependence of one fact upon another; by which, out of that we can presently do, we know how to do something else when we will."'"I 8 The English Works of Thomas Hobbes, ed.

'2 A previous study linking Hobbes and Vico with respect to "making and knowing" found the principal strands of the problem included in a single passage: Of arts, some are demonstrable, others indemonstrable; and demonstrable are those the construction of the subject whereof is in the power of the artist himself, who, in his demonstration, does no more but deduce the consequences of his own operation. The reason whereof is this, that the science of every subject is derived from a precognition of the causes, generation, and construction of the same; and con- sequently where the causes are known, there is a place for demonstration, but not where the causes are to seek for. Geometry therefore is demonstrable, for the lines and figures from which we reason are drawn and described by ourselves; and civil philosophy is demonstrable, because we make the commonwealth ourselves. But because of natural bodies we know not the construction, but seek it from the effects, there lies no demonstration of what the causes be we seek for, but only of what they may be.13 In the present context we cannot and need not go into the Hobbesian concep- tion of civil law and sovereignty, according to which "we ourselves make the principles-that is, the causes of justice (namely laws and covenants)-whereby it is known what justice and equity are."' 4 But it is worth noting that geometry provides a model for civil order (as it does in a different way for other sciences) not because it is purely formal and self-contained, but because it begins from definitions and principles to which all can agree. The axioms of geometry are universally accepted because they are not "contrary to any man's right of dominion, or to the interest of men that have dominion."' 5 The idea that we 295-296), Hobbes writes that in "questions of human science, whose truth is sought out by natural reason and syllogisms, drawn from the covenants of men, and definitions, that is to say, signifi- cations received by use and common consent of words, . . . truth therefore depends on the compacts and consents of men." In Leviathan, Ch. 5 (English Works, Vol. III, p. J) the emphasis is on rendering precise and unambiguous what is accepted or agreed upon: "the light of human minds is perspicuous words, but by exact definitions first snuffed, and purged from ambiguity." 12Hobbes, Leviathan, Ch. 4 (English Works, Vol. III, p. 23). 13Thomas Hobbes, "The Epistle Dedicatory," Six Lessons to the Professors of the Mathematics (English Works, Vol. III, pp. 183-184), also quoted in Arthur Child, "Making and Knowing in Hobbes, Vico, and Dewey," University of California Publications on Philosophy, 1953, 16:271-310, on pp. 271-272. Child writes that his "paper originated in part from the quotation of this passage by M. H. Fisch in the introduction to his translation, with T. G. Bergin, of The Autobiography of Giambattista Vico (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1944), pp. 40f." In turn I am indebted to Child and Fisch. 14Thomas Hobbes, De homine, Ch. 10, ?5, translated in Hobbes, Man and Citizen, ed. Bernard Gert (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday Anchor, 1972), p. 42. The whole of ??4 and 5 is relevant here, particularly the distinction of "truth of consequences" (scientia) from "truth of fact" (cognitio), which leads to a distinction between a priori and a posteriori demonstration. The former is possible "only of those things whose generation depends on the will of men themselves," such as geometry or "politics and ethics," whereas the latter must serve in physics, a "mixed mathematical" science in which nothing can be demonstrated a posteriori (from knowledge of fact) "without something also being demonstrated a priori." "5Hobbes, Leviathan, Ch. 11 (English Works, Vol. III, p. 91). Compare this passage on geomet- rical truth "as a thing that crosses no man's ambition, profit or lust" to the invidious contrast made between geometricians and moral philosophers in the dedicatory letter of De cive (trans. in English Works, Vol. III, p. iv): "If the moral philosophers had as happily discharged their duty [as have geometers], I know not what could have been added by human industry to the completion of that happiness which is consistent with human life. For were the nature of human actions as distinctly known as the nature of quantity in geometrical figures, the strength of avarice and ambition, which is sustained by the erroneous opinions of the vulgar as touching the nature of right and wrong, would presently faint and languish."

This paper, however, concentrates on Vico's conception of rationality or truth in science and its foundation in various forms of human making. II. THE LINKING OF FACTUM AND VERUM IN VICO In De nostri temporis studiorum ratione Vico compares the methodological orientations of the classical and the modern intellectual world, explicitly ex- tending and modifying Bacon's survey. He is particularly concerned to see what advantages of the ancients' system of arts and sciences might have been sacri- ficed in the progress of modern science, and whether these might be recovered or compensated for without detriment to the modern critica. Vico's partial endorsement of the classical recourse to topica, which contrasts with the modern "critical" predisposition, must be understood as a function of his pedagogical focus, that is, his concern with the nurture of young minds whose progress should recapitulate the cultural development that led from antiquity to modernity. Many scholars, particularly in Germany, read this text incorrectly as calling for a rehabilitation of classical practical philosophy as the basis of emerging humanistic disciplines.'6 But Vico does not identify critica exclusively with natural-scientific approaches, nor advocate topica as an approach for mo- dern human science. His conception of the civil order here, far from favoring a return to the Aristotelian distinction between theoretical and practical cognition, seeks precisely to orient practice flexibly to universal rational ideas, to the true, to justice in the moderate modern form of civil equity.17 It is not the prudentia of the classical republic that Vico claims as a model for modern civil life, but the jurisprudentia of the popular monarchy of later Rome, an orientation that places Vico in the line of political thinkers that leads from Hobbes to Montesquieu and Hume.18 What is most important for the present question is that Vico believes that early encouragement of imagination would further, not hinder, the predominant cultural pursuit of rational truth. Just as "the goal which today is most particu- '6See, e.g., Hans-Georg Gadamer, Wahrheit und Methode (Tubingen: Mohr, 1960; 4th ed. 1975), pp. 16-21; Karl-Otto Apel, Die Idee der Sprache in der Tradition des Humanismus von Dante bis Vico (Bonn: Bouvier, 1963), pp. 103, 327-329, 336-344; and Jurgen Habermas, Theorie und Praxis (Neuwied: Luchterhand, 1963), pp. 16-18, 42n., 45-46, 50. All three see Vico as renewing the Aristotelian conception of phronesis (prudentia) in its opposition to sophia (scientia) as a means of opposing Bacon and/or Hobbes. See also Ferdinand Fellmann, Das Vico-Axiom: Der Mensch macht die Geschichte (Freiburg: Alber, 1976), pp. 17, 34-35, 55, 167, rev. by J. Bamouw in The Eighteenth Century: A Current Bibliography, 1978, N.S. 4. '7See Jeffrey Barnouw, "The Relation between the Certain and the True in Vico's Pragmatist Construction of Human History," Comparative Literature Studies, 1978, 15:242-264. Vico draws on Nichomachean Ethics 1137b for his conception of equity, but he elaborates it in a framework that reverses Aristotle's separation of practical knowledge and science by correlating equity with a procedure characteristic of modem empirical science. In De nostri temporis studiorum ratione, (Ch. 7, he transforms the opposition between science and prudence by introducing sapientia as the most adequate approach in the practical sphere. It is the second of Vico's four practical types, the astute but unread man, who in effect relies on prudence, while the fourth type, the man of sapientia, orients himself to general truth (of which prudence is incapable), but approaches it indirectly and flexibly. In the German translation by Walter F. Otto, Vom Wesen und Weg der geistigen Bildung (Godesberg, 1947), p. 61, the distinction between prudentia and sapientia is obliterated when both are rendered as Klugheit (prudence), a mistake that has misled those who see Vico as working for a rehabilitation of classical practical philosophy, e.g., Habermas, Theorie, p. 17. '8See Jeffrey Barnouw, "The Critique of Classical Republicanism and the Understanding of Modern Forms of Polity in Vico's New Science," Clio, 1980, 9(3), in press.</page><page sequence="7">VICO AND THE CONTINUITY OF SCIENCE 615 larly pursued, i.e. ideal or universal truth, is exceedingly beneficial to poetry," so conversely cultivation of imagination provides a basis for the critical or rational capacity. It was for this reason, he says, that the Greeks trained youths in logic by means of geometry, "which cannot be grasped without a vivid capacity to form images."' 9 This conviction leads Vico to oppose the analytic geometry of Descartes, as had both Hobbes and Newton's teacher Isaac Barrow, because it isolates mathe- matics from the concrete sphere of sensuous imagination, of evidence.20 Vico objects to Cartesian analysis because its abstract quality hampers not only education but science. He denies that the new form given to geometry by Des- cartes played a role in the scientific and technological breakthroughs of the seventeenth century. He claims in fact that analysis leads to failure in practical application, a Baconian criterion already turned against Descartes by Leibniz. Vico's disparagement of Descartes is thus perfectly consistent with his enthusi- asm for the role of geometry and geometric method in leading to new inventions and to advances in mechanics. It is patently wrong, though still common in Vico studies, to identify critica with Cartesian tendencies exclusively and geometrical method with analysis. Vico opposes Descartes because he sees that founding science in the cogito in effect undermines its basis-not only its progressivity and practical applicability, but its very rationality. Central to Vico's understanding of science is his Baconian emphasis on the interdependence of the empirical and the rational, his Hobbesian conception that the operational and constructive aspects of science are integrated: Let us leave aside the question whether geometry has undergone greater develop- ment by means of "analysis," and whether modern mechanics constitutes something new. What cannot be denied is the fact that leading investigators have available to them a science enriched by a number of new and extremely ingenious discoveries. Modern scientists, seeking for guidance in their exploration of the dark pathways of nature, have introduced the geometrical method into physics. Holding to this method as to Ariadne's thread, they can reach the end of their appointed journey. Do not consider them as groping practitioners of physics: they are to be viewed, instead, as the grand architects of this limitless fabric of the world: able to give a detailed account of the ensemble of principles according to which God has built this admir- able structure of the cosmos.21 The fact that the geometrical method has been introduced into physics is far more significant for Vico than the epistemological difference between geometry 19I quote De nostri temporis studiorum ratione from the loose translation by Elio Gianturco, On the Study Methods of Our Time (Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1965), p. 14. 20Gianturco, in his notes to Study Methods, p. 27, refers to Carl B. Boyer, History of the Calculus and its Conceptual Development (New York: Dover, 1959), p. 175, on Hobbes and Barrow as opponents of the "arithmetization of mathematics." Boyer--recognizes the connection of this ten- dency in Hobbes with the physical application of the Hobbesian conception of conatus, which influenced the -subsequent development of the calculus. That Vico shared Hobbes's misgivings is clear from a passage in his Autobiography (cit. n. 13), p. 125: "So perception is striken by algebra, for algebra sees only what is right under its eyes; memory is confounded, since when the second sign is found algebra pays no further attention to the first; imagination goes blind because algebra has no need of images; understanding is destroyed because algebra professes to divine." In discussing "blind" or "symbolic" thinking, Leibniz argued on the contrary that it could be advantageous for thinking to be able to proceed without concern for the meaning or even meaningfulness of the signs it was using.

The passage echoes the Baconian contrast of mere empirics, preoc- cupied with singular empirical causes and immediate effects, to those metaphy- sicians in a good sense, who are concerned with the formal causes, the structure and laws, of the universe. This perception is consistent with Vico's recognition that the truths brought out in physics by the geometrical method are never more than probable. Hobbes had maintained the same tenet in the last part of De corpore, while justifying physics as a science. Vico's enthusiasm for science is also consis- tent with the counsel he derives from the ineradicably conjectural character of physics, that we should be content to study it "as philosophers, that is, curbing our presumption," and even-a distinctly Baconian note-"cultivate the study of physics in order to curb our pride."22 In the course of this argument Vico states what has since been seen as the nucleus of his epistemological principle: "We demonstrate geometry because we make it; if we could demonstrate physics, we would make it," that is, make the natural world. Vico quotes this sentence from himself the following year in De antiquissima Italorum sapientia, where he elaborates it in a context that seems predestined to heighten his reputation for obscurity.23 But Vico's ideas are not obscure once we lay them out. Vico first distinguishes cogitatio, which is characteristic of human knowledge, from the intelligentia that we attribute to God. Pursuing his etymological bent, he emphasizes the root meaning legere, "to read," in construing intelligere as perfecte legere, and he points to the sign relation that links words to ideas, ideas to things, which makes reading a way of knowing, when one knows the lan- guage. Intelligere is the Latin equivalent of Hobbes's "understanding"; it was used by Leibniz in the same sense, in a context that underlines its link with operatio.24 By contrast, cogitare suggests for Vico an ongoing process of gather- ing, andar racogliendo, open-ended and inductive, whereas intelligere (cf. colli- gere, collect) implies a bringing together of all elements. Man is thus said to participate in reason, not to possess it completely. It is as if he had to interpret a text while discovering or learning its language. The definition of the true as that which one knows by having made it is first used here to characterize the divine capacity of intuitive understanding or intel- ligentia. God contains and controls the elements, internal as well as outward, of all things, whereas the human mind, finite and external to things, can never comprehend the whole. But this contrast also implies a parallel. God knows (cognoscit) because he creates and disposes; man knows (novit) because he makes and composes. The active component of human knowing is the key to man's participation in the divine form of cognition, intelligere. Science essentially includes knowledge of how its object is constituted or came to be, knowledge that God possesses wholly and intimately, man partially and 22lbid., p. 23. 23Translations of De antiqluissima Italormm sapientia are soon to be published in German (Munich: Fink) and English (Ithaca: Cornell University Press), but I have coped with the Latin text (Giam- battista Vico, Opere filosofiche, ed. Paolo Cristofolini, Florence: Sansoni, 1971), aided by Cristo- folini's Italian translation and Jules Michelet's French version (De l'antique sagesse de l'ltalie, in Oeuvres choisies de Vico, Paris: Flammarion, 1894, pp. 211-280). 24In an early text, Definitio justitiae universalis, Leibniz defined pernoscere (which he equated with intelligere): "Pernoscere est nosse, quid res agere aut pati possit. Scilicet tum per se, tum cum aliis combinata. Haec vera notitia practica est. Theorema enim est propter problema. Scientia propter operationem." Adolf Trendelenburg, who first published this text (which Vico could not have known), remarked that its source was Hobbes, De corpore, Ch. 1 [?6]. See Vittorio Mathieu, "Wissenschaft und Wirksamkeit bei Leibniz," in Akten des II. Leibniz-Kongresses (cit. n. 20), pp. 147-155. This conception of understanding as based in operation is historically linked to an idea of understanding takes on a hermeneutic cast, as I hope to show in a later essay.</page><page sequence="9">VICO AND THE CONTINUITY OF SCIENCE 617 by way of externals. Human truth is not a paradox but simply a limited reality, the assurance of which depends on an awareness and observance of its limits. Or even on turning those limitations to advantage, which man does when he creates for himself two fictions: the dimensionless point, which can nonetheless be represented, and the unit which can be multiplied. On the basis of these two artificial terms man has founded a world of forms and numbers which he is able to comprehend in its entirety. Like Hobbes, Vico insists on the actively constructive aspect of the foundation of this "world" of geometry and arithmetic: not only its problems, but its very theorems present a task involving operatio, where people commonly but mis- takenly think it a matter of contemplatio. In effect, man cast himself in the image of God the creator by turning what had been tokens of the deficiency of his knowledge into a strength or virtue. Vico's summation of this development is revealing: since man is not capable of grasping the natural elements from which things derive their reality, he creates for himself the elements of words, from which ideas are called forth without controversy.25 The influence of Hobbes, perhaps mediated or reinforced by Leibniz, is evident here too, as it is where Vico says that science does not divide men in the way that opinion gives rise to sects.26 He relates this freedom from controversy to what he says was customary Roman usage, equating ques- tions of name and of definition. To seek the definition was to determine what the word called forth "in the common mind of men." The implicit linguistic character of this verum factum-truth through making- model of knowing now reveals an Ockhamist-conceptualist aspect. The capacity for fictions and artificial signs, a mark of inadequacy when measured against the intimacy and immediacy of divine knowledge, provides the key to a conception of distinctly human scientific knowledge. Reference to a divine model of intelli- gentia no longer sets a standard or limit for man's science, beyond the bare idea of knowing the truth which one has oneself produced. It is this affirmative, even celebratory, conception of modern science that Vico undertakes to defend against the attacks of skeptics and dogmatists. Here is the context of his critique of Cartesian epistemology. Descartes is for him repre- sentative, not of a revolutionary yet overweening natural-scientific consciousness, but rather of a dogmatist position intimately linked with skepticism and itself a danger to the informing attitude of modern science. In this sense he opposes his verum factum principle to the "clear and distinct ideas in the mind" which Descartes had claimed to be the criterion of scientific knowledge. The "clear and distinct idea" fails not only as a criterion of the true, Vico argues, but as a criterion of rational self-consciousness, since the mind, in knowing itself, does not make itself and cannot know how it is itself constituted. He expands this point into a critique of the metaphysics based on Descartes's cogito ergo sum. The cogito as self-awareness is not scientia but merely conscientia, knowledge by acquaintance or mere certitude (certum), and it cannot provide the grounds for any demonstrative truth, about the thinking self or the world.27 The skeptic agrees in this critique of dogmatism, of the pretended first truth of immediate self-awareness in the cogito, and therefore the only way to over- come the skeptic is to locate the criterion of the true in having made it oneself. The certainty of consciousness itself (conscientia) must be secured in and through objective knowledge, that is, knowledge which is objective for being part of, not 25Vico, De sapientia, Ch. 1, Sects. 1 and 2 (Opere filosofiche, pp. 63, 67, 69). 26Vico, De sapientia, Ch. 4, Sect. 2 (Opere filosofiche, p. 93). 27Vico, De sapientia, Ch. 1, Sect. 3 and 4 (Opere filosofiche, pp. 73, 75).</page><page sequence="10">618 JEFFREY BARNOUW apart from, our effectual practical involvement with the world. The constitutive reliance on operatio marks the difference between a Hobbesian conception of understanding (intellectio) and the self-evidence claimed for ideas in the dis- engaged Cartesian cogito. Vico repeats from his 1709 work the critique of Cartesian analysis, that, unlike geometry, it is uncertain in its practical application. He follows Bacon in seeing a model for science in those arts which aim at an end which they them- selves have proposed, because they start from principles contained in the mind that show how something is made or done, whereas rhetoric, politics, and medicine remain "conjectural arts." Furthermore, those arts and sciences that are not rooted in forms contained in men's minds tend, as Bacon also suggested, toward self-inflation and uselessness. For the same reason Vico rejects Aris- totelian physics as abstract and universal, while he praises the operationally constituted physics of the moderns for being guided by the experimental pro- duction of effects that correspond to the particular workings of nature. He then compares, strikingly, the methodological orientation of empirical natural science to that of the jurist who is able to discern the special circumstances of fact that determine when an exception must be made for the sake of equity, and, further, to that of the historian who, untempted by either a compendium of facts or sweeping general causes, pursues the facts to their last consequences and par- ticular causes.28 Vico extends his verum factum principle to physics not only because physics is integrated with mathematical reasoning, but also because experimentation con- nects physics with the technical and creative arts. In the third chapter, "On Causes," Vico says, "If the true is the made, then to prove or try [probare] by causes is to make or bring about [efficere] and thus cause and activity [negocium] are the same thing, namely, operation, and the made and the true are the same thing, namely, the effect." The continuity here with Bacon and Hobbes is un- mistakable. Vico goes so far as to offer an adaptation of the conception of the subjectivity of sensation, variously elaborated by Galileo, Descartes, and Hobbes, according to which we create the objects of sense in sensing.29 This notion extends into the creativity of imagination: because it produces the images of things, phantasia is extravagantly claimed to be a "most certain faculty." The intellect itself, finally, is seen as "the faculty by which in understanding [intelligere] something we make it true." This ability is exemplified primarily by arithmetic and geometry, but Vico also generalizes: "Man, directing [intendendo] his mind to things, engen- ders their modes and images and human truth." 28ViCo, De sapientia, Ch. 2 (Opere filosofiche, pp. 77, 79). 29Vico, De sapientia, Ch. 7, Sect. 1 (Opere filosofiche, p. 113). In Letter 26 of On the Aesthetic Education of Man, trans. R. Snell (New York: Ungar, 1965), p. 125, Friedrich Schiller wrote, "The reality of things is the work [Werk, creation] of things, the appearance of things is the work of Man." He was extending a Kantian motif and turning it against Kant, who rather emphasized the passivity of sense and the active constructive aspect of the understanding. In Section 7 of his Anthropology Kant writes that "we understand [verstehen] (according to its form) strictly only what we can make, given the necessary matter, and thus the understanding is a faculty of spontaneity in our cognition . . . because it submits representation to certain a priori rules and even makes experience possible." See Jeffrey Barnouw, "The Morality of the Sublime: Kant and Schiller," Studies in Romanticism, 1980, 19, in press, where it is argued that Schiller sets transcendental idealism "back on its feet" by grounding it in empirical psychology. When Friedrich H. Jacobi first linked Vico with Kant in 1811-quoting De sapientia: "we demonstrate geometry because we make it; if we could demonstrate physics, we would make it"-he was mainly interested in the phenomen- alism he thought he saw there and its implication for fideism. Vico, on the contrary, like Hobbes (and Schiller) brings out the subject's active involvement in sense or appearance in order to secure the continuity from "phenomena" to reality. See Jeffrey Barnouw, "Hobbes's Causal Account of Sensation," Journal of the History of Philosophy, 1980, 18:1-17.</page><page sequence="11">VICO AND THE CONTINUITY OF SCIENCE 619 The subjective idealism suggested by these last claims may seem to sort ill with the operationalist anchoring of knowledge that Vico turned against Des- cartes. In The New Science Vico carries over the idea that sensation creates its own objects, together with the telling etymology of the "ol-factory" sense, when he characterizes the vividness of sensing in the heroic age. The idea is thus part of the developmental approach epitomized by the aphorism homo non intelli- gendo fit omnia, an imaginative so-called metaphysics in which early man "made of himself an entire world" by lack of understanding, by anthropomorphic reduction and projection.30 In The New Science, then, the element of subjective idealism is linked strictly with conscientia and "the certain," as opposed to (but also preparing the way for) a grasp of things according to "the true." The denial of divine intelligentia to "natural" man and the (now gradual) reversal of this deficiency into an efficacy have taken on a new disposition and meaning: they are now the terms by which humanity produces itself through its civil history. Vico anticipates The New Science in De antiquissima Italorum sapientia, and he suggests that the heroic non intellegendo may lead to knowledge secured through operation, when he defines ingenium, the proper faculty of knowing (sciendi), as the capacity of contemplating an object and then making an object like it (faciendi similia). Beyond connecting ingenium as "wit" with a capacity for bringing together disparate things, as in simile and metaphor, Vico understands this capacity as social mimesis, the inborn tendency to imitate, which is a source of sociability. "Thus the similitude of customs gives rise to common sense in the nations," that is, common sense is originally contained in the community of customs, brought forth and carried forward by human activity, but not by conscious intention. This idea leads into the heart of Vico's new science. In the conclusion Vico says that he has presented a metaphysics which sup- ports experimental physics by teaching us to see as true in nature whatever we can imitate by experiment (simile . faciamus).31 His astute appreciation of natural science and his sense of solidarity with it in his own new science have largely been obscured, however, by exaggerated attention to such rhetorical passages in The New Science as the following: But in the night of thick darkness enveloping the earliest antiquity, so remote from ourselves, there shines the eternal and never failing light of a truth beyond all question: that the world of civil society has certainly been made by men, and that its principles are therefore to be found within the modifications of our own human mind. Whoever reflects on this cannot but marvel that the philosophers should have bent all their energies to the study of the world of nature, which, since God made it, He alone knows; and that they should have neglected the study of the world of nations, or civil world, which, since men had made it, men could come to know.32 Here the making was not deliberate, the principles not conscious ones, and the men who made the civil world to begin with are not the same as those who are to gain knowledge (scienza) of it. The verum factum principle has been extended metaphorically, and it would require a separate essay to inquire into the trans- formation and into the meaning and validity of the principle in its new form. Vico nevertheless saw a continuity from his earlier writing. In The New Science he elaborates on the verum factum principle and its corollary, that "history cannot be made more certain than when he who creates the things also 30Giambattista Vico, The New Science of Giambattista Vico, trans.

Here "creation" refers to the constructive activity of the his- torian, construing the givens according to "an ideal eternal history," as much as to the original conjectured making of that civil world. The rationality of history, which derives from the historian's act of construction or interpretation (and is thus rooted in his awareness and analysis of the modifications of the human mind), offers a close analogy, then, to the science of physics and its use of mathematical thinking: "Now, as geometry, when it constructs the world of quantity out of its elements, or contemplates that world, is creating it for itself, just so does our Science, but with a reality greater by just so much as the institutions having to do with human affairs are more real than points, lines, surfaces, and figures are. "33 Geometry should not be compared with the reality of history, however, but with the ideal history, the pure construction that allows the historian to construe the real, as the natural science "makes" nature rational. Much has been done recently, and much more remains to be done, to under- stand Vico's "new science" as a science. Further study of the emergent human sciences in general may build on the insights gained from close reading of his earlier writings, links themselves in the continuity of science. 33Ibid., ?349, pp. 104-105.</page></plain_text>
