<plain_text><page sequence="1">Conversations with a Shadow: Thomas Gray's Latin Poems to Richard West by W Hutchings S OME of Thomas Gray's letters are communications about non- communication. He wrote to Horace Walpole from Burnham in August 1736, giving a typically self-mocking and literary account of his life there during the vacation. He pictures himself as "il pense- roso," squatting at the foot of a tree and reading his Virgil: ... in this situation I often converse with my Horace aloud too, that is, talk to you; for I don't remember, that I ever heard you answer me; I beg pardon for taking all the conversation to myself; but it is your own fault indeed.' Six years later, in May 1742, he wrote to Richard West, another friend from school-days at Eton: You see, by what I sent you, that I converse, as usual, with none but the dead: They are my old friends, and almost make me long to be with them.2 In the first letter, Gray describes himself conversing with a living, but absent, friend. In the second, he sees himself as talking to the dead, who are present: he has been commenting to West on Scaliger's edi- tion of Propertius, and he goes on to say that he "drank and sang with Anacreon for the last fortnight" and is "now feeding sheep with Theocritus." The dead, in the shape of classical writers, are actually more present than the living Walpole: their words, their texts constitute the substance of Gray's conversation. Both letters are themselves, of course, communications with the living, and in that sense form part of 1 The Correspondence of Thomas Gray, ed. Paget Toynbee and Leonard Whibley, 3 vols.

But the living die: within less than a month after the letter to West, Gray will write another letter to the same man, containing his "Ode on the Spring," only for it to be returned unopened because West had died in the interim. Conversations in writing require a reader: the living Gray is there to react to his Propertius and his Anac- reon, but what becomes of Gray's own words when sent to a dead man? The death of West remained present in Gray's consciousness. Norton Nicholls records that, whenever he mentioned West to Gray, "he looked serious, &amp; seemed to feel the affliction of a recent loss." 3 Nearly thirty years later, the possibility of loss affected intensely Gray's response to the departure from England of his new young Swiss friend, Charles-Victor de Bonstetten, whom Nicholls had introduced to him. Gray wrote to Bonstetten on 9 May 1770:- Such as I am, I expose my heart to your view, nor wish to conceal a single thought from your penetrating eyes.-All that you say to me, especially on the subject of Switzerland, is infinitely acceptable. It feels too pleasing ever to be fulfill'd, and as often as I read over your truly kind letter, written long since from London, I stop at these words: La mort qui peut glacer nos bras avant qu'ils soient entrelaces.4 Earlier, in April, Gray had written to Bonstetten of his immediate feel- ings on the loss of his company: "My life now is but a perpetual con- versation with your shadow."5 The shadow was never to resume its substance: Gray's project of visiting Bonstetten in Switzerland the next summer had to be abandoned, and Gray himself became a perpetual shadow on 30 July 1771. Gray's communications with absent shadows are in English: the let- ters, the "Ode on the Spring." But Latin, a dead language, the language of the shades, was for him a living force. Nicholls records asking Gray "when he first perceived in himself any symptoms of poetry; he an- swered that he believed it was when at Eton he began to take pleasure in reading Virgil for his own amusement, &amp; not in school-hours, or as a task."6 As we have seen, when Walpole is absent, Virgil is present. That letter has even, jokingly, to explain that by Horace is meant Horace Walpole, since the context might lead us to think first of the Latin poet. Reading is one form of conversation, writing another. Latin composi- 3 Norton Nicholls's Reminiscences of Gray.

William Mason, in his Memoirs of Gray prefixed to his edition of his friend's works, comments that "Certain it is, that when I first met him, he seemed to set a greater value on his Latin poetry, than on that which he had composed in his native language."7 In view of what Nicholls says about Gray's memory of West, Mason's observation becomes particularly telling, for almost all Gray's impor- tant Latin poems are addressed to West. The language of the dead was Gray's most intimate form of communication with his most intimate friend; until he wrote West a poem in English, only to find that West was dead. In a letter dated June 1738, Gray sent to West from Cambridge a Sap- phic ode, his longest poem in this form and, in Mason's words, "the first original production of Mr. Gray's Muse; for verses imposed either by schoolmasters or tutors ought not, I think, to be taken into the con- sideration."8 In his Commonplace Book, Gray gave this poem the title "Ad C: Favonium Aristium," an elaborated version of the punning name (Favonius: the west wind) by which West had been known to the other members of the "Quadruple Alliance" at Eton. West had gone down from Oxford earlier in the year, and he, like Gray who had been ad- mitted to the Inner Temple in 1735, was intended to take up a legal career. On leaving Cambridge, which he did in September 1738, Gray was supposed to join West in rooms at the Temple. But the poem, far from looking forward to their new challenge, invites West to join in con- trasting the noisy, unpleasant world of legal dispute with an idealized vision of a life dedicated to the muses and spent in rural retreat: Barbaras aedes aditure mecum, Quas Eris semper fovet inquieta, Lis ubi late sonat, et togatum Aestuat agmen!

Hutchings 121 10 thou, about to approach with me the barbarous dwelling which unquiet Strife ever haunts, where legal dispute sounds far and wide, and the civilian army throngs.]9 West is about to enter with Gray "barbarous temple(s)," "Barbaras aedes" as the Latin punningly has it, where all is crowds and anger. Gray's emphatic placing of "Aestuat agmen" in the short final line of the Sapphic stanza sets it off against the equivalent phrase in the second stanza: Dulcius quanto, patulis sub ulmi Hospitae ramis temere iacentem Sic libris horas, tenuique inertes Fallere Musa? (11. 5-8) [How much sweeter, lying at ease under the spreading boughs of a sheltering elm, to while away the idle hours with books and the humble Muse?] The Muse replaces the "agmen," the army of seething crowds, as books ("libris") are both a replacement for, and a witty linguistic expansion of, legal disputes ("lis"): the Muse may be humble, but books are really more substantial, at least by a syllable, than lawsuits. This wished-for rural idyll is, of course, the very stuff of literary convention, Gray's "patulis sub ulmi / Hospitae ramis" recalling in its language as well as its stance the most-imitated original of such ideal visions, the opening of Virgil's first eclogue: Tityre, tu patulae recubans sub tegmine fagi silvestrem tenui musam meditaris avena. [You, Tityrus, lie under your spreading beech's covert, wooing the woodland Muse on slender reed.] 10 And, equally of course, Gray knows how conventional his poem is. His first substantial English poem will be the "Ode on the Spring" (origi- 9 Text and translation from The Poems of Thomas Gray, William Collins, Oliver Goldsmith, ed. Roger Lonsdale (London: Longmans, 1969). 10 Text and translation of Virgil from the Loeb edition, ed. H. Rushton Fairclough, vol. 1 (London: Heinemann, 1916). Roger Martin, whose account of Gray's Latin poems in his Essai sur Thomas Gray (Paris: Les Presses Universitaires de France, 1934) remains the full- est, comments on the conventionality of the poem: 'Les traits du paysage, la phraseologie mythologique, l'atmosph&amp;re, les plus gracieux details eux-memes, le parfum du vent, le bruit de l'eau sur les cailloux, tout est connu" (p. 309).</page><page sequence="5">122 Thomas Gray's Latin Poems nally entitled "Noon-Tide. An Ode"), which, exactly four years later, in June 1742, will be the last poem he sends to West. In the English poem, the poet also courts the Muse in stereotypically idyllic rural surround- ings, in the shade of "the oak's thick branches" and the glade of "the rude and moss-grown beech" (11. 11-14), the last phrase being a neat alliance of personal landscape (the beech-woods of Stoke Poges, where Gray was staying during the summer of 1742) and Virgilian landscape. Gray's words "temere iacentem" ("lying thoughtlessly, at ease") in 1738 turn four years later into "(At ease reclined in rustic state)" (1. 17), the parenthesis acting as a self-conscious indicator of the conventionality of the attitude in which poet and Muse will ponder the vanity of the crowd: "oh, by the way, of course we shall be lying at ease.""II Later in the Sapphic ode, the poet places himself in passive pose: "Me reclina- tum teneram per herbam" (1. 21: "Me reclined on the soft grass"). Gray transfers easily from one language to the other: he is as laid-back in Latin as he is in English. But the easeful stance of the poet in "Spring" is subverted by the insect youth who, initially as objects of his facile moralizing, reverse his lazy anthropomorphism by turning the tables and moralizing upon his own real isolation: "Poor moralist! and what art thou? / A solitary fly!" (11. 43-44). The poem here undermines the very conventions by which it initially operates, so exposing their inadequacy as a depiction of real experience. But the Latin poem uncritically accepts, and indulges in, the convention as a source of wishful longing. Its very conventionality, indeed, emphasizes how long it has been the object and the vanity of poetic wishes. This world of soft grass, clear skies and purling brooks where the cares of life melt away into peaceful, and highly literary, re- pose is the knowingly self-indulgent vision of a poet ready to wink at his own naivety. However, the connections between the Sapphic ode and the later "Ode on Spring" run deeper than this. For the Latin poem, too, is an ode on spring: Risit et Ver me, facilesque Nymphae Nare captantem, nec ineleganti, Mane quicquid de violis eundo Surripit aura. (11. 17-20) 11 A. L. Lytton Sells, who is the most observant commentator on Gray's sources, notes the "temere iacentem" / "at ease reclined" parallel (Thomas Gray: His Life and Works [London: Allen and Unwin, 1980], 156).</page><page sequence="6">W Hutchings 123 [The spring smiles on me, and the kindly Nymphs, as I catch with no undiscriminating nostrils whatever the morning breeze steals from the violets as it passes.] Spring smiles for "me"-the joking egotism being echoed in the fol- lowing 'Me reclinatum" and expressing its self-consciousness in the self-regarding double negative "nec ineleganti"-and the nymphs are not departed. The "purple year" awakened by "rosy-bosomed Hours" in "Spring" (11. 1-4) is Gray's literary equivalent of Virgil's "ver pur- pureum" (Eclogues, 9, 40: "purple spring").12 In the Latin poem it is Phoebus who shines down on the earth in purple and gold: Namque, seu, laetos hominum labores Prataque et montes recreante curru, Purpura tractus oriens Eoos Vestit, et auro. (11. 33-36) [For. . .,whether, while his chariot gives life again to the pleasant toils of men and the meadows and hills, he clothes the lands of the East as he rises with purple and gold.] The labors of men (happy husbandmen, of course, not poets) are "laetos" ("blessed with happiness"), as the crops at the beginning of Virgil's Georgics are "laetas segetes," and Phoebus is specified as the beneficent source of the purple year.'3 However, as the poem's form would suggest, Virgil is not the only, nor the chief, Latin point of reference. The most celebrated lyricist of the classical period is recalled through allusion to one of the eighteenth century's favorite Horatian epistles, that to Aristius Fuscus (I, 1o), not only by the way in which Gray's title identifies West with Aristius, but also by the shared situation of poet within a rural setting (Gray's imag- ined world, Horace's Sabine farm) writing to an intimate friend. Horace is "laetus," happy, in everything save that "non simul esses" (1. 50: "you are not with me")."4 Gray, though similarly separated from his friend, includes his Favonius by linguistic sleight-of-hand as a presence within his spring landscape, for the poet's enjoyment of his simple cares, so different from those of the law, depends upon Favonius: 12 See Arthur Johnston, "'The Purple Year' in Pope and Gray," RES, n.s. 14 (1963): 389-93. 13 "Smiling" is the eighteenth-century equivalent of "laetus."

(11. 25-28) [These innocent cares absorbed my heart at about the time when the year was new, as long as the fresher season of Favonius provided clear skies.] The season ("hora") which dispels the clouds of winter so that Phoebus can shine is that of Favonius: the sun so faithfully served by the poet ("Sedulus servo, veneratus orbem / Prodigum splendoris": 11. 36-37: "I serve him diligently, worshipping the orb so lavish of its splendour") is revealed to him by the power of West. Since Gray is writing in the form most clearly associated with Horace's adaptations of Greek meters, it is not surprising that, in addi- tion to the epistle signalled by Gray's title, Horace's odes are to be found lying quietly behind the texture of Gray's poem. Spring and Favonius are linked in the opening line of Odes, I, 4:15 Solvitur acris hiems grata vice veris et Favoni. [Keen winter is breaking up at the welcome change to spring and the west wind.] Winter's grip is released by Favonius/West, as in Gray's ode; and, as in "Spring," where the rosy-bosomed Hours are "Fair Venus' train" (1. 2), the natural fecundity of the goddess oversees the resultant idyll, as Venus leads a dance of the Nymphs and the Graces. But Death is present in Horace's Arcady: the poet tells his beloved Sestus that life's brief span forbids us to build up our hopes: "o beate Sesti, / vitae summa brevis spem nos vetat incohare longam" (11. 14-15). The darkness of death presses on us, and then no longer will one be able to gaze with wonder on the tender Lycidas ("tenerum Lycidan mirabere," 1. 19). Other odes of Horace are glanced at by Gray's highly literary text, none more significantly than his Sapphic ode addressed to Septimius (book 2, 6):16 Septimi, Gadis aditure mecum et Cantabrum indoctum iuga ferre nostra et '5 See also book 3, 7, 11. 1-2; book 4, 7, 1. 9. 16 'Saepe enim curis vagor expedita / Mente" (11. 9-lo: "For I often roam, my mind unburdened with cares") uses phrasing from Horace's Sapphic ode, book i, 22.</page><page sequence="8">W Hutchings 125 barbaras Syrtis, ubi Maura semper aestuat unda. (11. 1-4) [Septimius, you who are ready to go with me to Gades, to Cantabria still untaught to bear the imperial yoke, and to the wild Syrtes where the Moorish sea tosses incessantly.] A comparison with Gray's opening stanza, quoted above, shows that Gray repeats the phrase "aditure mecum" ("ready to go with me") in the same position in the line (Horace's "et" is elided in the scansion); that the places where Horace has been on military service are "bar- baras," as are the places of Gray's future legal service; and that these hostile places are marked by the heaving of the sea and, metaphori- cally, of the crowd ("aestuat" is also placed in identical positions in the stanzas). Horace invokes the peaceful landscape of Tibur or Tarentum as an antidote to such turmoil; but, again, Arcady contains intimations of mortality: ille te mecum locus et beatae postulant arces; ibi tu calentem debita sparges lacrima favillam vatis amici. (11. 21-24) [That place and its blessed heights summon thee and me; there shalt thou bedew with affection's tear the warm ashes of thy poet friend.] It will be Gray, four years later, who grieves for the death of West, addressing words, in the lament which constitutes the fragment of a second book of "De Principiis Cogitandi," to West's ashes, his "favil- lae"-the final word of the poem, and of Gray's poetic epistles to his friend. Tears form no part of "Ad C: Favonium Aristium," whose projected idyll is allowed to unfold without disturbing hindrance. Yet there are tears in the whole letter Gray sent to West with this poem, for he also included in it this single Alcaic stanza: O lacrimarum fons, tenero sacros Ducentium ortus ex animo; quater Felix! in imo qui scatentem Pectore te, pia Nympha, sensit!</page><page sequence="9">126 Thomas Gray's Latin Poems [O fount of tears, that have their sacred sources in the tender spirit; four times blessed is he who has felt you, holy Nymph, gushing forth from the depths of his heart!] These "perfect lines" have been admired for themselves, but it is their context, a communication from Gray to West, that creates their full sig- nificance."7 The tears in the stanza are not of grief, but of sensibility, coming from the heart, from the tender spirit, sanctifying those who feel them. This is the language of friendship, of fellow-feeling, given an intimate meaning by the word "quater," whose point can only lie in its hint of the Quadruple Alliance within which Gray and West were first bound together. Communication derives from shared experience and knowledge, and its language shapes the feeling shared intimately be- tween poet and addressee. Marching time's ironic metamorphosis will convert tears of happy sensibility to those of sorrowful sensibility, those of a man "Now drooping, woeful wan, like one forlorn, / Or crazed with care, or crossed in hopeless love" (Elegy, 11. 107-8). Gray did not enter the "barbaras aedes" of the Temple. Instead, he soon found himself within the actual landscape whose idealized ver- sion underlies classical-and eighteenth-century-retirement poetry. In the early spring of the next year, 1739, Horace Walpole and Gray left England on their tour of France and Italy. While abroad, Gray regularly kept in touch with West by letter, sometimes including Latin verses. The Sapphic stanza "Horridos tractus" was sent from Genoa on 21 November 1739, the verses about the river Trebia from Florence on 15 January 1740, those about "The Gaurus" (Monte Barbaro) from Florence on 25 September 1740, and a farewell to Florence on 21 April 1741 .18 These are travel-verses, descriptive in character or marking the stages of Gray's journey, like the substance of the letters themselves. It is in the spring of both years of his absence, 1740 and 1741, that Gray, as if recording an annual rite, sends to West Latin verses of a more intimate kind. In May 1740 he sent from Rome an Alcaic ode whose title, "Ad C: Favonium Zephyrinum," is a reminder of the earlier Sap- phic stanzas by means of a further elaboration of the pun on "West" in which the Greek name for the west wind is added to the Latin. The poet calls on the goddess Flora, "Mater rosarum," to tell him in what shade 17 The phrase is Mason's, Memoirs, p. 33. See John Sparrow, "Gray's 'Spring of Tears," RES, n.s. 14 (1963): 58-61. 18 Correspondence, i, 129; 1, 137; 1, 176-77; 1, 182.</page><page sequence="10">W Hutchings 127 Zephyrus loves to beguile the busy day ("non inertem . . . sub umbra," 11. 5-6). Perhaps West lets the golden plectrum sleep, or perhaps he retentat Pierio Zephyrinus antro (11. 7-8) [reawakens it in the Pierian cave.] While Gray is treading the classic ground of Italy, West has -like Gray himself in the Sapphic ode -to create it imaginatively in song. He must "dwell imaginatively in the ancient world," as the verse-line encloses his name within the Muses' cave.'9 If West, in his inspired state, forgets his friend, declares the poet, then West himself is far from forgotten: Gray summons the woods overlooking the Anio to witness that it is West's name that has echoed within the landscape: Illius altum Tibur, et Aesulae Audisse silvas nomen amabiles, Illius et gratas Latinis Naiasin ingeminasse rupes. (11. 17-20) [lofty Tibur and the delightful woods of Aesula have heard his name, and ... it is his name that the crags dear to the Latin Naiads have re-echoed.] Nature, by re-echoing West's name, testifies to the poet's fidelity to the memory of his friend. In this ode, Gray is literally following in the poetic footsteps of Horace by witnessing the landscape where once dwelt the "Dulce canens Venusinus ales" (1. 24: "the sweet-singing bird of Venusia"). Horace was born at Venusia, and his Sabine Farm was situated ten miles from modern Tivoli, the "Tibur" of line 17. Horace had celebrated his own landscape in the seventh ode of book 1, whose description of "praeceps Anio ac Tiburni lucus" (1. 13: "the tumbling Anio and the grove of Tiburnus") is directly recalled by Gray's "Anio minax" and "altum Tibur" (11. 14, 17: "impetuous Anio", "lofty Tibur"). This landscape resounds still with the spirit of Horace, itself poetically reinvigorated by Gray's adoption of one of the forms brought to per- fection by the Latin poet. Thus poetry and the landscape that fosters it act as mutual commemorations of each other's human associations. 19 Lytton Sells, Thomas Gray, 157.</page><page sequence="11">128 Thomas Gray's Latin Poems But poetry also memorializes the fidelity of human love: it testifies that the living poet is not "immemor . .. amici" (11. 9, 11: "forgetful of his friend"). Gray's confession that he is unable to emulate his great predecessor in fact demonstrates his witty mastery of the form: Mirare nec tu me citharae rudem Claudis laborantem numeris: loca Amoena, iucundumque ver in- Compositum docuere carmen. (11. 29-32) [Do not therefore wonder at me, ignorant as I am of the lyre, struggling along with faltering notes: these delightful places and the cheerful spring have taught me my ill-composed song.] The poet's song is "in- / Compositum," as he jokingly reveals by doing what Horace never did, breaking a word over a line. "In- / Composi- tum" is indeed "incompositum," but by so being it renders "Composi- tum" a self-sufficient adjective for "carmen." The composed nature of the ode is demonstrated in its conclusion: Haerent sub omni nam folio nigri Phoebea luci (credite) somnia; Argutiusque et lympha, et aurae Nescio quid solito loquuntur. (11. 33-36) [For, believe me, beneath every leaf of the dark grove cling visions from Phoebus, and the streams and breezes speak with something more than usual eloquence.] Cheerful spring does lead Gray to his expression of fidelity to West, so that the streams and the breezes are made eloquent: the poem ends on "loquuntur," a statement of achieved voice in nature and in poet. That nature can become so alive, reverberant with West's name, de- pends on a creative interaction of poet and language; just as, in a daring analogy suggested in the opening address to the goddess "cui tenerae vigent / Aurae Favoni" (11. 1-2: "for whom the gentle breezes of the west wind rise"), it is the inspiring breath of Favonius that activates nature. According to Ovid's Fasti, Flora was raped by, and then mar- ried, Zephyrus.20 In the Sapphic ode, we recall, it was the west wind that 20 Fasti, 5, 195-206. Flora goes on to say that she enjoys perpetual spring ("vere fruor semper," 1. 207).</page><page sequence="12">W Hutchings 129 blew away the clouds of winter, allowing Phoebus to appear in his full glory. The analogy now, by turning to a male/female myth, engenders a new creative and sexual force. But myths have a way of rebounding less happily on their human creators. In this poem, a further level of allusion disturbingly under- mines the poem's ecstatic assertion of achieved voice. The idea of landscape re-echoing the torrential sound of water is common enough in eighteenth-century, and earlier, descriptive poetry,2' but that these rocks specifically re-echo a name uneasily recalls Virgil's celebrated evocation of the death of Orpheus, the type of the poet: tum quoque marmorea caput a cervice revulsum gurgite cum medio portans Oeagrius Hebrus volveret, Eurydicen vox ipsa et frigida lingua, a miseram Eurydicen! anima fugiente vocabat. Eurydicen toto referebant flumine ripae. (Georgics, IV, 523-27) [Even then, while Oeagrian Hebrus swept and rolled in mid-current that head, plucked from its marble neck, the bare voice and death-cold tongue, with fleeting breath, called Eurydice-ah, hapless Eurydice! 'Eurydice' the banks re-echoed, all adown the stream.] Years later, in his Pindaric ode "The Progress of Poesy," Gray perhaps recalls the same myth: Now rolling down the steep amain, Headlong, impetuous, see it pour: The rocks and nodding groves rebellow to the roar. (11. 10-12) Because he is describing the river of poetry, the context may invite a distant echo of that original poetic rebellowing, so eerily hinting that, although the stream of poetic tradition may continue, the individual poet perishes, even as the Bard's prophecy, in Gray's sister Pindaric ode, leads to his personal destruction. Landscape can become a threat- ening place, as Gray acknowledges in his description of the volcanic Gaurus in the lines he sent to West in September 1740: Hinc infame loci nome, multosque per annos Immemor antiquae laudis nescire labores Vomeris, et nullo tellus revirescere cultu: 21 Lonsdale, 163, notes parallels in Dryden, Pope and Thomson.</page><page sequence="13">130 Thomas Gray's Latin Poems Non avium co]les, non carmine matutino Pastorum resonare. (11. 40-44) [Hence the evil repute of the place, and for many years, forgetful of its ancient renown, the soil knew nothing of the labors of the plough and would not grow green again with any cultivation. The hills did not re-echo with the morning song of birds or shepherds.] The name of a place can forget its former self, can replace fruitfulness by barrenness, so that no songs of nature or of humanity can resound within it. But, for the present, the landscape of Italy resonates harmoniously with Gray's verses addressed to the living West. The next spring, on 12 April 1741, Gray sent West a letter enclosing the opening of "De Principiis Cogitandi," his hexameters intended to be in the manner of Lucretius, with Lockeian psychology replacing epicureanism as the guiding metaphysic. "Master Tommy Lucretius," he later called the poem, with characteristic modesty.22 The first book is dedicated to West ("Ad Favonium"), and the fragment of a second book will constitute an elegy on West, "spes tanti et causa laboris" (1. 4: "the inspiration and cause of so great a task"). The "driving force of the poem is West," observes William Powell Jones, and West read, in 1741, Gray's direct appeal to him: Tuque aures adhibe vacuas, facilesque, Favoni, (Quod tibi crescit opus) simplex nec despice carmen, Nec vatem: non illa leves primordia motus, Quanquam parva, dabunt. (11. 16-9g) [And you, Favonius, lend me an attentive and sympathetic ear (for the work is produced for you) and do not despise the simple poem nor the poet; for these beginnings, though small, will give rise to no trivial activities.] 1 The poem seeks its audience in the very cause of its existence, thus establishing what the second and third lines of the poem call the slender chain of memory ("tenuemque catenam / Mnemosyne"). Gray's career 22 Mason, Memoirs, ii6n., states that the letter contained the first 53 lines of "De Prin- cipiis Cogitandi." Gray's phrase is Correspondence, 1, 225. 23 William Powell Jones, Thomas Gray, Scholar (New York: Russell and Russell, 1965), 51. "Quod tibi crescit opus" is an adaptation of Horace, Odes, 2, 8, where young men ('pubes ... omnis") are in the place of "opus."</page><page sequence="14">W Hutchings 131 has been seen by S. H. Clark as an expression of, and an exploration of the limits of, Lockeian empiricism, "a series of rigorous meditations on the Lockean self." In this empiricism, memory is crucial, since upon it the very nature of personal identity depends: "the continuity of the self becomes necessarily temporal."24 The identity of Gray's poetry de- mands the continued existence of its addressee, for there alone can be guaranteed a sympathetic and attentive ear and a fond breast upon which it can rely. Gray's inclusion in the same letter to West of his Latin version of Buondelmonte's Italian lines on the multiple disguises of Amor deepens, albeit playfully, his message. Walpole had already sent West his English version, suggesting that the Quadruple Alliance complete the task by West "putting it into French, and Ashton into Greek."25 Gray characteristically adds in his version the warning that Amor is not to be trusted and should be fled; but the opening lines are clear enough: Lusit amicitae interdum velatus amictu, et bene composita veste fefellit Amor. [Sometimes Love jested, concealed in the cloak of friendship, and disguised himself in seemly attire.] The two sets of verses in this one letter join love to friendship, and both to memory and the name of Favonius. Immediately after Gray sent this letter on 21 April 1741, there oc- curred the mysterious quarrel between Gray and Walpole which led to Gray's unexpectedly rapid return home, alone, to take up where he had left off in the spring of 1739. On his journey back, Gray wrote his only significant Latin poem not addressed to West and not written in the spring. He and Walpole had visited on their way down the monastery of the Grande Chartreuse, and Gray had been immensely impressed by its solemn and romantic setting.26 He chose to stop off at the monas- tery on his return journey, and to write an Alcaic ode in the monastery album, dated 21 August 1741. The poem is an invocation to the "severi religio loci" (l.i: "divine spirit of this forbidding place"), beseeching for the weary youth writing the poem a "placidam . . . quietem" (1. 12: 24 S. H. Clark, "'Pendet Homo Incertus': Gray's Response to Locke," ECS 24 (1991): 273-91, 484-503 [274, 2821. 25 Horace Walpole 's Correspondence with Thomas Gray, Richard West and Thomas Ashton, ed. W. S.

The quiet of the remote monastery is set against the violent movement of the waves of life, recalling those legal disputes envisaged in "Ad C: Favonium Aristium" where "Aestuat agmen": Quod si invidendis sedibus, et frui Fortuna sacra lege silentii Vetat volentem, me resorbens In medios violenta fluctus. (11. 13-16) [But if Fortune forbids me, in spite of my wish, to enjoy this enviable dwelling and the sacred rule of silence, sucking me back violently into the midst of the waves.] The envied dwelling and the sacred rule of silence constitute the oppo- site of the "Barbaras aedes" to which the earlier poem objected and to which Gray now seems to be inevitably returning. The monastery presents for Gray an image of calm set amidst savage landscape, wild ridges, precipitous ravines, thundering waters, dark woods, unlike that other Temple which, far from being a refuge from the storms of life, is itself an embodiment of savagery and tumult. It is not surprising, then, that most of the few comments critics have made on this Alcaic ode see the poem as a straightforward, deeply personal statement of Gray's desire for a quiet life.27 The final stanza's hope that he may pass the untroubled hours of old-age in some remote corner, far from the common crowd and the cares of men, fits neatly with Gray's decision- at the ripe old age of 25-to renounce London and the law in favor of the Cambridge to which he will return in October 1742 and which will thereafter serve as the intellectual and geographical center of his life. But this kind of biographical reading does not gauge the full reso- nance of this measured and meditative ode. Gray's choice of a mon- astery album-book as the recipient of the verses shows all the care of a writer for whom audience is so consistently important. His plea for silence is addressed, not to the living West, but to the spirit of this iso- lated place. Time was to add its own symbolic postscript by having the album destroyed during one of the most tumultuous and public of eighteenth-century events, the French Revolution.' However, as is the case with all the poems discussed here, Gray also transcribed the ode into his Commonplace book. The audience there is himself, but also Time, which will preserve his memory in the verses for, if chance 27 Martin, Essai sur Thomas Gray, 312; Morris Golden, Thomas Gray: Updated Version (Boston: Twayne, 1988), 33. 28 N&amp;Q 1 (1850): 416.</page><page sequence="16">W Hutchings 133 should haply send, some kindred spirit to read. For these temporary and provisional audiences, the lines take on a deeper and more com- plex emotional resonance when it is observed that, on parting from Horace Walpole, Gray yet more resolutely courts his Latin Horace for his allusive texture. The failure of the present takes Gray into conversa- tion with the past. But this is a living past, for his dialogue with Horace dramatizes and particularizes his present position. Gray writes of how the wild landscape of the Grande Chartreuse presents the spirit of a God more strongly than "si repostus sub trabe citrea / Fulgeret auro" (11. 9-1o; "if, kept under a roof of citrus-wood, He glowed with gold"). In the first ode of Horace's book 4, it is "sub trabe citrea" (1. 20) that a young devotee of Venus is envisaged setting up a marble image of the goddess. Horace's poem beseeches Venus to spare the middle-aged poet after another battle, since he is no longer a young man devoted to his beloved: "non sum qualis eram bonae / sub regno Cinarae" (11. 3- 4: "I am not as I was under the sway of kindly Cinara"). It contrasts youth and age, setting the former's adoration of love in a suitably pas- toral context. Gray's allusion links his renunciation of youth, love and idyllic classicism with a savage landscape as one truer to the spirit of his deity. But Horace's ode is about how such a willed renunciation is in fact challenged by the pressure of experience, how his equanimity is shaken at eve with throbbings of noontide. The joys of youth are gone: me nec femina nec puer iam nec spes animi credula mutui nec certare iuvat mero. (11. 29-31) [Me nor lad nor maid can more delight, nor trustful hope of love returned nor drinking bouts.] Yet, if so, why, he asks Ligurinus, do tears surprise his cheeks and silence fall amidst his words? The answer is that human feeling, marked by the repeated intimacy of "te," will always re-assert itself, even if only in the unconscious mind: nocturnis ego somniis iam captum teneo, iam volucrem sequor te per gramina Martii campi, te per aquas, dure, volubilis. (11. 37-40) [In visions of the night, I now hold thee fast, now follow thee in flight o'er the Campus Martius' sward, now midst the whirling waves, o thou hard of heart!]</page><page sequence="17">134 Thomas Gray's Latin Poems Of further and complementary significance is Gray's quotation from another ode of Horace. His invocation of the spirit of the place at line 11, "Salve vocanti rite" ("if I invoke Thee rightly"), repeats the last three words of Horace's book i, ode 32, a poem addressed to his lyre, that is, to poetry itself. In this poem Horace acknowledges his great predecessor and model in Alcaeus who, even in time of war, Liberum et Musas Veneremque et illi semper haerentem puerum canebat et Lycum nigris oculis nigroque crine decorum. (11. 9-12) [was wont to sing of Bacchus, the Muses, Venus and the boy that ever clings to her, and Lycus beautiful for black eyes and raven locks.] Only fragments of Alcaeus's poetry have survived, of varied subject- matter including much that is political. So Horace's account of his work has been influential in establishing an association between the name of Alcaeus and love poetry. "Though Alcaeus apparently had a reputation as a poet of love, including the love of boys, there is remarkably little evidence of it in the fragments. Of the poems addressed to boys there is little or no trace; we have only Horace's declaration that Alcaeus 'sang of Lycus, beautiful with his dark hair and dark eyes.' "I Alcaeus's Lycus and Horace's Ligurinus are the shadows lying behind Gray's Alcaic ode. The cares of men from which the poet vainly seeks refuge are also the dreams and tears which interrupt Horace's plea for peace. Gray returns from Italy and Walpole to England and West. On 5 May 1742, West sent Gray his English "Ode to May," whose opening stanza invites Gray to join in his song to spring:' Dear Gray, that always in my heart Possessest far the better part, What mean these sudden blasts that rise And drive the Zephyrs from the skies? O join with mine thy tuneful lay, And invocate the tardy May. The invocation that follows calls on the month to resume her reign by restoring the sun, reviving the skies, recalling "the Zephyrs from the 29 G. M.

Hutchings 135 west" (1. 14), and so creating "Peace, Plenty, Love, and Harmony" (1. 28). Gray replied on 8 May, simply making some literary remarks about West's poem. The real and intimate answer to the actual substance of the poem is to be found in Gray's "Ode on the Spring," sent to West in early June, but returned unopened. It was only when Gray saw in a newspaper Ashton's lines on West that he learned of the death of his friend, which had occurred on the first day of June.31 The confident opening stanza of Gray's intended reply picks up details in both Gray's own earlier Latin poetry to West and West's appeal to dear Gray: Lo! where the rosy-bosomed Hours, Fair Venus' train, appear, Disclose the long-expecting flowers, And wake the purple year! The Attic warbler pours her throat, Responsive to the cuckoo's note, The untaught harmony of spring: While whispering pleasure as they fly, Cool zephyrs through the clear blue sky Their gathered fragrance fling. In "Ad C: Favonium Zephyrinum," Venus accompanies the goddess Flora, for whom the breezes of Favonius rise. The "purple year" brings into English the language of Virgil's eclogues by way of "Ad C: Favo- nium Aristium." The "harmony of spring" is nature's response to clear skies and cool zephyrs threatened by the "sudden blasts" of the "Ode to May." The stanza is thus a positive answer to West's appeal: Gray does join him in a celebration of achieved spring. But the poem goes on to question the poet's own part within this har- mony of spring. His solitude is starkly exposed by insects who, as we have seen, get their own back on all moralizing writers by moralizing on the poet: On hasty wings thy youth is flown; Thy sun is set, thy spring is gone- We frolic, while 'tis May. (11. 48-50) The poem's ending is all too prophetically true: Favonius and spring are no more, and this dialogue with West is actually a conversation with his shadow. This is the last poem Gray physically sent to West, but also, 31 Correspondence, 1, 213.</page><page sequence="19">136 Thomas Gray's Latin Poems as it uncannily recognizes, the first poem of Gray's life without West, a life "remoto . . . angulo", far from "hominumque curis" ("Alcaic Ode," 11. 17, 20: "in some secluded corner," "the cares of men"). The Alcaic ode to silence and the poet's self is the precedent for the two poems which directly and certainly address the death of West?2 The twenty-nine lines of a further book of "De Principiis Cogitandi" were sent to Walpole-an ambiguous contribution to fence-mending- in 1747, but are dated in Gray's Commonplace book, where they are headed "Liber Secundus," as having been begun in June 1742, immedi- ately after hearing of the death of his friend.3 An English sonnet on the death of West, but not addressed to him, is dated August 1742 in the Commonplace book. Like all his Latin poems, this sonnet was not published during Gray's life-time. Those few critics who have com- mented on Gray's Latin writings tend to regard the Latin elegy-for this is what the "De Principiis Cogitandi" lines really are-as the more spontaneous poem, freer and more natural than the English sonnet, as befits the earlier response to West's death, but also reflecting a view that Gray wrote with greater facility in Latin than he did in English. Jones sees the Latin verses as the only lines Gray ever wrote which portray genuine personal emotion. Golden agrees that the Latin verses are more direct than the sonnet, but qualifies this by contrasting the Latin "rough sketch, the direct expression of an individual shock" with the crafted sonnet, a conventional form used "to express the universal- ized response that is to embrace all of humanity, not his single private and therefore insignificant bereavement." Lytton Sells declares that, in general, "Latin verse came to Gray more easily than English, which explains why he confided to such verse his more intimate feelings." For Clark, writing in Latin offers "a kind of liberation for Gray," whereas the use of Latinate idioms in his English verse can seem "convoluted, affectedly archaic."' These observations rightly respect the importance of Latin for Gray, but do underestimate the degree to which these two poems are inter- related, and do not note the extent to which they form together a powerful conclusion to what we can term Gray's series of spring com- 32 The possibility that the Elegy may have begun as a tribute to West has been raised, but remains speculative.

Joseph Foladare, "Gray's 'Frail Memorial' to West," PMLA 75 (1960): 61-65, however, finds the Latin lacking the sonnet's "revelation in epithet and image of the kind of life West helped to create, and consequently, a full measure of the desolation brought by his death" (p. 64).</page><page sequence="20">W Hutchings 137 munications to West. The first book of "De Principiis Cogitandi" is, we recall, dedicated to Favonius, "Quod tibi crescit opus." Thus, appropri- ately, Gray "completes" its fragmentary form with a lament for the loss of the "spes tanti et causa laboris." As the work grew for West, so it de- clines in sympathy with him, the cause now of elegy since he is hidden "aeternam fati ... in umbram" (1. 5: "in the eternal shadow of Death"). The poet hoped for "reducemque iterum roseo ore Salutem" (1. 12: "the return of Health, with rosy cheeks"), but the "rosy-bosomed Hours" of spring and Venus will return no more. The poet was "Credulus heu longos, ut quondam, fallere soles" (1. 14: "Foolishly trusting, alas, that we might spend the long, sunny days as before"), but without West those days must now be spent in weeping. The final lines make up the heart of the elegy: At Tu, sancta anima, et nostri non indiga luctus, Stellanti templo, sincerique aetheris igne, Unde orta es, fruere; atque oh si secura, nec ultra Mortalis, notos olim miserata labores Respectes, tenuesque vacet cognoscere curas; Humanam si forte alta de sede procellam Contemplere, metus stimulosque cupidinis acres, Gaudiaque et gemitus, parvoque in corde tumultum Irarum ingentem, et saevos sub pectore fluctus: Respice, et has lacrimas, memori quas ictus amore Fundo; quod possum, iuxta lugere sepulcrum Dum iuvat, et mutae vana haec iactare favillae. (11. 18-29) [But you, blessed spirit, who do not need my grief, rejoice in the starry circuit of the heavens and the fire of the pure ether whence you sprang. But, if, released from cares as you are, but not beyond mortal concerns, you look back with pity on once-familiar toils and are free to perceive our trivial anxieties; if, by chance, you look down from your lofty seat on the storm of human passion, the fears, the fierce promptings of desire, the joys and sorrows and the tumult of rage so huge in our tiny hearts, the furious surges of the breast; then look back on these tears, also, which, stricken with love, I pour out in memory of you; this is all I can do, while my only wish is to mourn at your tomb and address these empty words to your silent ashes.] Death and life are separate spheres, the latter the scene of human pas- sions-the sharp promptings of desire ("cupidinis": the most sexual word in Gray's poetry to West), the joys and the sufferings. The dead may cast one lingering, if not longing, look behind; but the living are</page><page sequence="21">138 Thomas Gray's Latin Poems trapped in tears, which Gray pours out in memory, stricken by love. Memory may sustain a continuity of experience, but, when the object of love is removed, language is but vain words addressed to silent ashes.35 For the English poem, Gray chooses the sonnet, a form above all associated with love: as with his choice of the Alcaic (and Sapphic) meters, form is significant.6 Spring has returned, but, whereas in "Ad C: Favonium Aristium" the pronoun established the poet's harmonious relationship with spring ("Risit et Ver me"), the pronoun is now, in the sonnet's first line, linked with "in vain," the English equivalent of "vana" in the final line of "De Principiis Cogitandi": In vain to me the smiling mornings shine. In the Latin poem from the spring of 1738, the poet's fidelity to Phoebus was guaranteed by Favonius's dismissal of the clouds of winter: caelum Quamdiu sudum explicuit Favoni Purior hora. (11. 26-28) [as long as the fresher season of Favonius provided clear skies.] Now, in 1742, reddening Phoebus lifts his golden fire, but "In vain to me." The season of love is celebrated by the birds who join in "amorous descant" (1. 4); but their harmony of love is still grammatically depen- dent upon that opening line. The poet's grief excludes him from the natural cycle of warmth and love, which is the province of the outside world, while I fruitless mourn to him that cannot hear, And weep the more because I weep in vain. (11. 13-14) Because the ashes are silent, communication is no longer possible: the "aeternam umbram" of "De Principiis Cogitandi" is an eternal silence. The result is a remorseless, unending cycle of increasing grief, which is unable to find its outlet since its very "causa" is the death of its only possible audience. Death provokes the urgent need to communicate, 35 "Vanae" is used by Horace to describe the shade of a dead person (Odes, book 1, 24). 36 Sappho gained, in later antiquity, the reputation of Lesbianism, although another tradition (see Ovid's Heroides) associates her with suicide for love of the beautiful youth Phaon. See Kirkwood, Early Greek Monody, ch. 4.</page><page sequence="22">W Hutchings 139 but precisely because the object of communication is the one who has been removed. The sonnet is received by Gray's Commonplace book, the album of his personal monastery with its own "sacra lege silentii." The last lines of Gray's two elegies on West are directly equivalent: all that Gray can do is "mutae vana haec iactare favillae," address vain words to silent ashes in a love poem devoid of its object. Since language is now locked in the silence of the self, its intimate, private form is empty of meaning and purpose. Gray from now on will only use Latin for adult versions of the scholastic exercises with which he began: translations from the Greek Anthology and "uninspired technical verses on the orders of insects."37 With the death of West, Latin has become a dead language.
