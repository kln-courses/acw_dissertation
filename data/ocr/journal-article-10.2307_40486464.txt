<plain_text><page sequence="1">Dersu the Trapper. By V. K. Arseniev ; translated from the Russian by Malcolm Burr. (New York: E. P. Dutton &amp; Co., Inc., 1941. viii, 352 pp. Glossary; index. Illustrations; maps. $3.00.) This book is the product of the author's three expeditions into the taiga (forest) of Ussuria - the Maritime Province of southeastern Siberia - between 1902 and 1908. The account of these expeditions is based upon the author's diary. Yet the material is topically as well as chronologically arranged. The narrative is so coherent that the reader is often unconscious of the fact that he is in reality perusing a diary. Although the story ostensibly centers about Dersu, a kind of Si- berian "pathfinder," who was born, lived, and died in the wilds of Ussuria, the material actually provides a good introduction to condi- tions in the vast Siberian taiga as they were during the period in ques- tion, and as they still are in certain areas even today in spite of the rapid industrialization of Siberia. As the leading geographer, ethnographer, and geologist of eastern Siberia, Arseniev displays an intimate knowl- edge and understanding of the animal and bird life, plant life, and ethnic groups of the taiga. Yet the story he tells is so simple, so vivid, so full of adventure that it may appeal to juvenile readers as well as to adults. In addition to the author's worth-while contribution on the fauna and flora of the taiga, he has likewise recorded the primitive animistic religious concepts of the native inhabitants, particularly of the Golds, to which tribe Dersu belonged. These anthropomorphic and anthropo- pathic characteristics of animism have their American counterpart in Lew Sarett's poem, "The Box of God." This book contains an index, three maps, and a very helpful glos- sary of terms unfamiliar to the average American reader. In another edition the translator would do well to include in this glossary the term "Old Believer," to which the author refers seven times. Great credit should be given to the translator for his skilful rendition into English, especially of Dersu's pidgin Russian.</page><page sequence="2">230 PACIFIC NORTHWEST QUARTERLY [April Although, strictly speaking, Dersu is not a scientific work in the usual sense of the term, the fact that the author, a Russian scientist of note, has been able to record here in popular form the story of his travels in a then little-known section of Siberia makes the book one of unusual interest to the layman and even of real value to the scholar.
