<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Apocalypse of Adam Stephen E. Robinson In 1945 a collection of thirteen leather-bound volumes, con- taining fifty-three separate compositions, was discovered in the vicinity of the small town of Nag Hammadi in Upper Egypt. Since that time this collection has generally been referred to as the Nag Hammadi Library. These manuscripts, written in Coptic, the lan- guage of Egypt during the first centuries of the Christian era, are the literary remains of a group of Egyptian Christians who prac- ticed a form of Christianity called Gnosticism. While Gnosticism was not confined to Egypt, it was there that the dry climate and a healthy distance from the watchful eyes of later orthodoxy worked together to preserve this remarkable collection of Gnostic scrip- tures. In contrast to the Dead Sea Scrolls, discovered two years later, there has been relatively little excitement over the Nag Hammadi find. Until recently, with the exception of the Gospels of Thomas and Philip, the Nag Hammadi materials had remained inaccessible and relatively unknown even to students of early Christianity. This is due partly to unsettled political conditions in the Near East which have made it difficult to obtain authoritative copies of the manuscripts, but it is equally a result of the scarcity of scholars in New Testament and early Church history who read Coptic con- fidently. Only in the last few years have authoritative texts for many of the documents become available and the value of Coptic for primary research in early Christian literature and the New Testa- ment been recognized. Thus, thirty years after their discovery, the Nag Hammadi documents are gradually receiving the attention they deserve, although most are still not available in English. In the future these documents will prove to be of increasing im- portance to biblical scholars and historians in general, and to LDS scholars in particular. An essay written for the Hugh Nibley festschrift, "Tinkling Cymbals," ed. John W. Welch, assembled on the occasion of Dr. Nibley's retirement. Copies of all festschrift essays are on file in casual publication in Special Collections, Harold B. Lee Library, Brigham Young University. Stephen E. Robinson is a doctoral candidate in Biblical Studies at Duke University. 131</page><page sequence="2">The Nag Hammadi Library is important to students of early Christian literature primarily because it represents an early type of Christianity completely unlike what has long been called "ortho- doxy." Walter Bauer demonstrated long ago that the traditional picture of Christian history is one from which the victorious fourth century Church carefully erased all traces of its earlier competition.1 Actually, in the first three centuries there were several brands of Christianity all competing for the title of "orthodoxy." These were often as large as, if not larger than, the Universal Church, and equally powerful and influential. The rediscovery of these varieties of Christianity and their extraordinary doctrines is forcing scholars to take another look at the nature of earliest Christianity. Although Gnosticism has long been known to scholars in a less complete form through the writings of the Church Fathers and through an occasional manuscript, it has usually been treated as a form of aberrant Christianity having only secondary significance. The discovery of the Nag Hammadi Library has reemphasized the fact that Gnosticism was not merely the "heretic fringe" of the Universal Church, but that in large areas of the ancient world Gnosticism was the Church.2 The importance of the Nag Hammadi texts to LDS scholars is that they not only witness an early Christianity significantly dif- ferent from the orthodox tradition, but that they witness the existence of certain peculiar doctrines and bits of tradition in very early Christianity that in modern times are found almost exclusively among the Mormons. The following few examples will demon- strate some of these teachings and traditions. The term Gnostic comes from the Greek word for knowledge (gnosis). Fundamental to Gnosticism was the belief that the principle of knowledge is the principle of salvation and that it is impossible for a man to be saved in ignorance. 5 Personal revelation was crucial. The knowledge necessary for salvation consisted, ac- cording to many Gnostic writings, of higher teachings and ordi- nances taught by Jesus and his disciples and transmitted in oral tra- aWalter Bauer, Orthodoxy and Heresy in Earliest Christianity (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1971). It should be understood, however, that Gnosticism is itself only a general term used to identify a variety of sects which shared the same general approach to religion, but which did not necessarily agree on specific tenets. The term Protestantism is used in much the same way to denote an approach to Christianity which differs from that of Catholicism. 3Cf. Joseph Fielding Smith, comp., Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1968), p. 297; see also Doctrine and Covenants 131:6. 132</page><page sequence="3">ditions which were most often too secret and sacred to be written down or to be discussed with any who were not worthy of them. On those occasions when they were written down, they appear to have been closely held and committed to writing only in an effort to preserve them for future generations. Although orthodox Christianity has emphatically denied that any such esoteric teach- ings ever existed, Gnosticism insisted not only that they were an important part of earliest Christianity, but also that they were the most important part. Quite often this secret teaching included a knowledge of certain passwords, signs, and seals that made it possible for the Gnostic to escape from the earth, to pass by angelic beings who barred the way, and to return to God. This was a literal return, for the Gnos- tics believed in the préexistence of man and even in his coeternality with God. The beautiful Gnostic "Hymn of the Pearl" portrays man as a spirit child of his Heavenly Father who lived as a prince in the palace of the Heavenly King before descending to the earth.4 Gnosticism frequently divides mankind into three categories: pneumatics, who are spiritual; hylics, who are not; and psychics, who are a little of both. Although psychics can be saved, usually it is only the pneumatics who can be saved in the highest degree of glory.5 According to the Gnostic Gospel of Philip, the highest ordi- nance of Christianity is eternal marriage/5 This ordinance must be performed in this life, and the "bridal chamber" where it is per- formed is called the holy of holies. We read from the Gospel of Philip 117:24-25, "But the holy of the holy ones is the bridal cham- ber," from 118:17-20, "But the woman is united to her husband in the bridal chamber. But those who have united in the bridal cham- ber will no longer be separated," and from 134:4-8, "If anyone becomes a son of the bridal chamber, he will receive the light. If anyone does not receive it while he is in this world, he will not receive it in the other place." There is also mention made of heav- enly garments and names which must never be spoken by those who know them.7 Gnosticism knows a married Christ, or at least ^Albertus Klijn, The Acts of Thomas (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1962), pp. 120-25. On the Origin of the World (CG 11,5) pl. 125-6.

'The Gospel of Philip (CG 11,3), 117:24-25, 118:17-29, 134:4-8, 124:6-8, 105: 21-22, 102:10-12. (R. McL.

It is usually in this creation setting or in a temple or on a mountaintop11 that Gnosticism places the revelation of the esoteric mysteries and the knowledge needed to thwart the archon- tic powers and return to God. Gnosticism is primarily concerned with the questions, Who am I ? Where am I from ? and What is my destiny? That the answers to these questions are often associated with the creation, the Garden, and the fall of man is probably due to the Gnostic presupposition that the end of all things is to be found in their beginning.12 Of those documents which manifest this concern, the Nag Hammadi Apocalypse of Adam is perhaps the prime example. SUMMARY OF THE APOCALYPSE OF ADAM The Apocalypse of Adam (CG V, 5) purports to record the revelation which Adam taught to his son Seth. According to the text, Adam first explains to Seth that after being created out of the earth, he and Eve possessed in unity a great glory, that Eve taught him a word of knowledge of the Eternal God, and as a result of this they were like the great eternal angels and were higher than the evil Creator God who made them. It is then told how the Creator God divided them into two aeons,1 { apparently an allusion to the *The Gospel of Philip (CG 11,3), 107:8-9, 111:32-37. Also, The Gospel of Thomas (CG IL2), 91:25-28). ?Carì Schmidt and Walter Till, Koptisch-Gnostiche Shriften, I 303, 1-11 (Berlin: Akademie- V erlag, 1962).

An aeon in a gnostic context is "one of the group of eternal beings that together form the fulness of the supreme being from whom they emanate and between whom and the world they are intermediaries" ( Webster's Third New International Dictionary [unabridged}, s.v. "aeon.") 134</page><page sequence="5">myth of the androgynous creation of Adam. Thus separated, their original glory and first knowledge leave them and enter into their seed to be manifest in future generations through the lineage of Seth. Seth himself is named after the great Savior figure who will be the manifestation of the lost knowledge and glory of Adam and Eve in some future generation. Adam and Eve, having lost their original glory and knowledge in the fall, now learn as men about dead things. They also now recognize the evil Creator God, who is roughly equivalent in Gnosticism to the Satan of Christianity. Adam then falls into a sleep during which three men come to him whom he does not recognize, because they are not from the Creator God, but presumably from the Great Eternal God. Saying "Adam, arise from the sleep of death . , ." they restore some of Adam's knowledge and tell him about the Savior/Illuminator who will eventually be born from his and Eve's seed. When Adam and Eve hear these things they give a sigh in their hearts Which is overheard by the evil Creator God. He then appears before them and insists that he is their god, the god who made them. He somehow causes Adam to lust after Eve (the text is broken here) and there is a second fall. Adam now reveals to Seth the things that the three men taught him, which consist of a vision of the future and of the appearance of the Savior/Illuminator. Adam prophesies that the Creator God will bring the Flood upon the world and destroy all men in order to kill the seed of Seth into whom the original knowledge and glory of Adam have entered. But angels from the Great Eternal God come on clouds and, plucking the seed of Seth from the flood, transport them to the place of the spirit of life. The Creator God has in the meantime made a covenant with Noah and his sons,14 promising to save them and give them kingship over all the earth if they will bear no seed of those who will not worship him. When the seed of Seth reappears, Noah is accused by the Creator God of breaking this covenant, Which Noah denies. The seed of Seth then go into a land by themselves and establish a Utopian community where there is no evil for 600 years, where angels of the Great Eternal God dwell with them, and where they are called by "the Name." Noah then divides the earth among his sons and charges his posterity to serve the Creator God in fear and slavery. But from ťhe seed of Ham and Japheth 400,000 men join themselves with the "See Genesis 9:9-17. 135</page><page sequence="6">seed of Seth. The remainder of the seed of Ham and Japheth form twelve kingdoms and serve their god Sakla, the Creator God. Inev- itably friction arises between the twelve kingdoms on the one hand and the seed of Seth with their 400,000 converts on the other. To vindicate his power in the eyes of the twelve kingdoms the Creator God sends some of his angels to rain fire, sulphur, and asphalt upon the seed of Seth. But again, the Great Eternal God sends his angels Abrasax, Sabio, and Gamaliel in clouds of light to descend upon the seed of Seth, lift them out of the fire,, and take them away. Some time after this the Illuminator of knowledge himself ap- pears in order to leave for himself fruit-bearing trees (i.e., men who have the gnosis) and to redeem their souls from death. This is the Savior promised to Adam and Eve. He performs great signs and wonders and mocks the powers of the Creator God. Because the origin and power of the Illuminator is something that the Creator God and his angels cannot explain, they 'punish his flesh." Nevertheless, they use "the Name" in error, and ask, "Where did it come from?" In answer to this question the twelve kingdoms of Ham and Japheth attempt to explain in short enigmatic state- ments how he was conceived, born, nourished and thus "came to the water." These statements follow the pattern of the first which is, in part: He was from ... a spirit ... to heaven. He was nourished in the heavens. He received the glory and the power of the one who is there. He came to the bosom or womb of his mother. And thus he came to the water. After the twelve kingdoms, a thirteenth adds its account. Then finally the fourteenth, the generation without a king, gives the correct answer which is God chose him from all the aeons. He caused a gnosis of the undefiled one of truth to be in him. She said: "He came from a foreign atmosphere (aer) . From a great aeon the great Illumina- tor came forth. He makes the generation of those men whom he has chosen for himself to shine, so that they shine upon the whole aeon." A great conflict follows between the seed of Seth, here referred to as "those who will receive his name upon the water" and the thirteen kingdoms. Finally the peoples cry out that the seed of Seth is truly blessed and that they themselves are in error, that they have perverted the truth and will die as a result. 136</page><page sequence="7">In answer to this mass confession of the kingdoms, a voice is heard (a bath kol ) addressed to the three aeons Micheu, Michar, and Mnesinous, who are over the holy baptism, condemning them for persecuting the seed of Seth, for fighting against the truth, and for polluting the waters of life in order to serve the Creator God. The voice then praises the seed of Seth (Gnostics) and assures them of their reward which they have earned by keeping the words they received and by not writing them down. The voice further declares that the truth will be borne through the generations by angelic beings and that the words of truth will be upon a high mountain upon a rock of truth and that those who know the Great Eternal God know all things. In the conclusion of the document, which follows the procla- mation of the heavenly voice, we are told that Seth passed these revelations on to his posterity. We are further informed that the secret gnosis is the holy baptism which is administered by the seed of Seth. Appended are the three names Jesseus, Mazareus, and Jessedekeus. CRITICAL ANALYSIS The Apocalypse of Adam is not, strictly speaking, an apocalypse, since it is only indirectly an account of the revelation to Adam. Rather, it is an account of Adam's final instructions to his son Seth. Since the 700th year (64:4) should be understood as the 700th year of Seth's life, it is also, according to the Septuägint chronology, the last year of Adam's life. This would indicate that the document is not an apocalypse, but rather a testament in the pat- tern of the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs, where the fathers also call their sons together just before their deaths for a last word of instruction and exhortation.15 The date of at least the major portions of the Apocalypse of Adam is very early. This is attested by the noticeable lack of an elaborate cosmogonie myth like those of demonstrably later Gnostic systems. The emanation of the archons, the fall of Sophia, and other characteristic elements of a more developed Gnosticism do not appear in the Apocalypse of Adam. It was the tendency of later Gnostic systems to continually refine the details of the creation and operation of the world in an effort to put distance between the highest God, the Absolute Good, and the actual created physical world, in which evil is undeniable. In the Apocalypse of Adam, 15Cf. The Testament of Levi 1:1-2. 137</page><page sequence="8">however, the shift from a purely mythological to a philosophical cosmogony has not yet taken place, and we do not find any such philosophical abstractions as Sophia, Nous , Sige, or Ennoia. The Apocalypse of Adam is consistently anthropomorphic and literal, showing nothing of the philosophical veneer of a more entangled Gnosticism.10 The only exceptions to this occur in the excursus on the fourteen kingdoms Which, as Hans-Martin Schenke and Charles Hedrick have suggested, may be an addition to the original text.17 Attempts to date the document precisely have been only partially successful. Jean Doresse has suggested that the Gospel of the Egyptians is to a degree dependent upon the Apocalypse of Adam.18 If this is correct, the Apocalypse of Adam is at least earlier than the Gospel of the Egyptians, which is usually dated before the third century a. d. The text shows unmistakable signs of dependence on a tra- dition sympathetic to that of the Old Testament, and there is in all probability a Jewish source behind the Apocalypse of Adam. Evidence of this can be found in the testamental form of the docu- ment, the Jewish angelology, the myth of the androgynous creation of Adam and Eve, the heavenly voice ( bath kol), the importance placed on "the Name/' and the fact that in this text Adam and Eve commit a real sin and experience a real fall. Likewise the ac- count of the destruction of the Sethian city in 75:9-11 almost cer- tainly draws upon the Old Testament account of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah.19 Furthermore, Josephus, a first century Jew, is already familiar with the tradition found in our text of Sethians who live apart in their own land, believe that the earth will be destroyed by water and fire, and who write thdr knowl- edge on pillars of stone.20 In contrast to these Jewish elements, the Apocalypse of Adam does not contain any elements which are necessarily Christian. All of the apparent Christian references can easily be explained from a8Cf., for example, Irenaeus, Against Heresies, Book 1, and The Apocryphon of John (CG 11,1).

Hellenistic mystery religions had many revealer/redeemer figures who taught their chosen fol- lowers the mysteries of salvation. Pre-Christian Judaism had a doc- trine of a suffering Messiah as Jeremias has shown,21 and thus George MacRae suggests that the section from the Apocalypse of Adam that deals with the suffering Illuminator is in essence a mid- rash on Isaiah 53.22 If this is true, the suffering-Messiah passage does not establish a Christian origin for the document, but rather strengthens the contention that it rests on a Jewish vorläge . The same result obtains in respect to the apparent reference to baptism. The refrain of the thirteen kingdoms "and thus he came to the water," is, to begin with, something of a riddle. Schenke goes back to an older Egyptian meaning for M OOY to get the translation "and thus he came into appearance," making the refrain refer to an epiphany.23 While this makes the phrase understandable, it relies on a meaning for MOOY which is not attested in Coptic. It is more likely that "and thus he came to the water" refers to the baptism of the gnosis (85:24-25) and would therefore have the sense of "and thus he came (at baptism) to knowledge and power." Since initia- tory baptism was not an exclusively Christian rite, there is no reason to' insist that these passages were written by a Christian or that they refer to the baptism of Jesus. In the final analysis, how- ever, the conviction that the Apocalypse of Adam is pre-Christian is based on an argument from silence, and MacRae cautions us with the reminder that while The Concept of Our Great Power (CG VI, 4) also contains no single indisputably Christian passage, the combined weight of its allusions and parallels makes its Chris- tian origin certain. In summary, it can be fairly stated that the Apocalypse of Adam is early, that it reflects a Jewish vorläge , and that it may be an example of pre-Christian Gnosticism. THE APOCALYPSE IRANIAN ? Alexander Böhlig has suggested more specifically that the Apocalypse of Adam may be an example of pre-Christian Gnosti- cism under the influence of Iranian religion.24 In evidence he offers "Walter Zimmerli and Joachim Jeremias, The Servant of God, Studies in Biblical Theology, no. 20, (London: SCM Press, 1957), pp. 57ff. ^George MacRae, "The Coptic Gnostic Apocalypse of Adam," The Heythrop Journal 6 (1965) :33. Hans-Martin Schenke, "Gegenwärtigen Stand," p. 133 (from Worterbuch, II, 52/53 [D]). 24Alexander Böhlig and Pahor Labib, Koptisch-gnostische Apikalypsen aus Codex V von Nag Hammadi im Koptischen Museum zu Alt-Kairo (Halle-Wittenberg: Wissenschaftliche Zeitschrift der Martin-Luther-Universität, 1963), p. 90. 139</page><page sequence="10">some Iranian parallels to the Apocalypse of Adam. For example, Böhlig notes that the three men who come to Adam at 65:26 cor- respond to the three Uthras in the eleventh book of the Mandaean Ginza. The descent of holy angels and the polluting of holy waters are also found in the same book of the Ginza. Surely the fact that all three of these motifs from the Apocalypse of Adam are found in the same book of the Ginza is striking and must be given due consideration. But at the same time, it remains that all three of these motifs have Jewish and Hellenistic parallels as well. As Böh- lig himself points out, it is likely that the reference to the three men in 65:26 is ultimately derived from the three angels who ap- pear to Abraham in Genesis 18: Iff. Pheme Perkins has drawn at- tention to a similar passage in I "he Death of Adam , w. 15-22, Where Eve sees three men enthrone Adam after his death.25 The three descending angels, A'brasax, Sabio, and Gamaliel are also found in the Gospel of the Egyptians. Although they are not ac- cused of polluting the waters, the aeons Micheu, Michar, and Mnesinous are specifically said to be over the living waters in Codex Brucianus.26 The scheme employed in the Apocalypse of Adam of three world ages separated by flood and fire also appears typically Iranian. But first century Judaism was already familiar with the same idea, even though it may ultimately have been borrowed. Josephus speaks of the Sethians setting their knowledge up on pillars of brick and stone that would survive these twin cataclysms.27 Böhlig has further suggested that the formulas of kingdoms seven, eight, ten, and eleven in the excursus on the fourteen king- doms refer explicitly to the birth of 'the savior/illuminator Mithra. However, all fourteen formulas are vague at best, and while it is true that some of them contain elements identified with Mithra, these elements are also found in connection with a number of other Hellenistic saviors. If the allusions were more specific we would probably find that the statements of the thirteen kingdoms repre- sent various "counterfeit" saviors from the Hellenistic mystery re- ligions, including Mithraism, while that of the- fourteenth, the generation without a king, represents the "true" understanding of the Savior professed by the Gnostics who produced the Apocalypse ^Pheme Perkins, "Apocalyptic Schematization," p. 594; see also Michael Stone, "The Death of Adam - An Armenian Adam Book," Harvard Theological Review 59 ( 1966) :283-91* i6Codex Brucianus, Baynes Papyrus LXI 18-21. 27Josephus, Antiquities, 1.2.3. 140</page><page sequence="11">of Adam. In any event, it is unlikely that all or most of them refer to Mithra, since Mithra himself is never pictured as a suffering Savior as is the Illuminator in this text. It has also been suggested that the fourteen kingdoms may be paralleled in Iranian religion by the fourteen light aeons of Mani.28 But it seems more probable that we are presented here with a contrast of thirteen false kingdoms against the one true genera- tion,29 since we are specifically told in 75:18-22 that the generations of the powers use the name, whatever it may be, erroneously. While there are solid Iranian parallels to the Apocalypse of Adam, it may be that the traditions found in the Apocalypse are just as likely to have their antecedents in Jewish and Hellenistic literature and ideas. But, while it may be unnecessary to draw on Iranian religion for ideas that are already found in the Mediter- ranean world, the fact that parallels can legitimately be called up from both the East and the West suggests that the mythical and religious preconditions of Gnosticism were more ubiquitous in the ancient world than is generally thought. THE APOCALYPSE AND THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS To Latter-day Saints, interest in the Apocalypse of Adam lies particularly in the following parallels to LDS religion. The docu- ment is a testament which Adam in the last year of his life leaves to his righteous posterity, the seed of Seth. Adam says that he and Eve were originally created with glory and knowledge. Eve brings knowledge to Adam and as a result 'Ve were as the great eternal angels," (64:14-16). The Creator God (Satan) separates them, thus bringing about a fall. Their original knowledge and glory leave them, and they become mortal. Now they recognize the Creator God. Adam falls into a sleep during which three men come to him and say "Arise, Adam" (66: 1-2). 30 They then instruct Adam and Eve and promise them that a Savior shall come into the world who shall suffer in the flesh. The content of their revelation to Adam consists of a vision of world history, which when combined 28Kephalia, 10.42ff. ^There are also thirteen aeons in the Pistis Sophia. See G. R. S. Mead, Pistis Sophia (London: John Watkins, 1947), p. 156ff. It should be noted here that if we are correct in interpreting the formulas of the thirteen kingdoms as representing inaccurate or false utterances, then the formula of the ninth kingdom which may be a reference to the fall of Sophia, may also be the polemic of one Gnostic sect against another. 30The "awakening of Adam" occurs elsewhere. See The Apocryphon of John 70:20-21 and 79:4-25. 141</page><page sequence="12">with what Adam has already told Seth, makes the Apocalypse of Adam an account of this world from the creation to the con- summation, with emphasis on the role and fate of the seed of Seth. The climax of world history is the coming of the Savior/Illuminator. The power of the gnosis is bound up with "the Name" at three points in the text (72:5-7, 77:20, and 83:6), although we are never told what the name is. The Gnostics will be rewarded for not writing down the words of the secret knowledge for they are to remain oral and secret (85:5-6). In the epilogue to the Apocalypse all of this is placed in a ritual setting, and the secret gnosis of Adam is identified with a ritual baptism or anointing (85:22-28). Much of this has a familiar ring due to similar constructs in the book of Moses, the Book of Mormon, and LDS ritual. But easily the most striking parallel is to the account of Adam-ondi-Ahman in D&amp;C 107:41-57. Here we are told that three years before his death Adam called his righteous posterity to him to receive his final blessing; in the Apocalypse of Adam this occurs in the last year of Adam's life. In D&amp;C 107:53, all of the patriarchs mentioned by name are of the seed of Seth; in the Apocalypse the revelation is given to Seth and is about his seed. In D&amp;C 107:42 Seth is told by his father that "his seed should be the chosen of the Lord and that they should be preserved unto the end of the earth"; in the Apocalypse, the glory of Adam passes into the seed of Seth, they are designated as the seed through whom the Savior will come, and their miraculous preservation from the attacks of the Evil One is foretold. In the Apocalypse there is an appearance of three angels; in D&amp;C 107:54 it is the Lord himself who appears. In the Apocalypse the history of the world to the final consummation is portrayed; in D&amp;C 107:56 Adam is said to have "predicted what- soever should befall his posterity unto the latest generation." A final caveat to this study must recognize, however, that parallels of themselves are neutral; they prove nothing. While it is hoped that Latter-day Saints will become excited and enthusiastic about such parallels as can be found between ancient literature and the beliefs of the Church, it is even more to be hoped that this en- thusiasm will lead to an increased participation by Latter-day Saints in the competent study of this literature for its own sake and not merely for the sake of those parallels. 142</page><page sequence="13">TEXT Plate 64 1.

And I saw three 27. men before me 28. whose likeness I was 29. not able to recognize because 30. they were not from the powers 31. of the god who made 32. us.

Then, as I listened to these words 10. from those great men, 11. who stood 12. before me, then we gave a 13. sigh in our heart, me and 14. Eve and the Lord God 15. who created us stood 16. before us. He said 17. to us "Adam, why have 18. you sighed in your heart? 19. Don't you know that I 20. am the god that created 21. you? And I breathed into 22. you a spirit of life, 23. a living soul."

For this reason the days 11. of our life became few. 12. And I realized that 13. I was under the power 14. of death. And now 15. my son Seth I will 16. reveal to you those things 17. which were revealed to me 18. by those men 19. whom I saw 20. at first 21. before me: 22.

And God 17. will say to Noah - he 18. whom the generations will 19. call Deucalion: "Behold 20.

Plate 71 1. Because of this I will give the earth to you, 2. to you and your sons. In 3. royalty you will rule over it, you 4. and your sons. And none of 5. that seed will come from you 6. of those men from another 7. glory who will not stand 8. before me. Then they will 9. be like the cloud of the 10. great light. Those men 11. will come who were 12. cast forth from the knowledge 13. of the great aeons and 14. angels. They will stand 15. before Noah and the aeons. 16. And god will say to 17. Noah: "Why have you 18. departed from what I told you? 19. You have created another generation that 20. you might scorn my power." Then 2 1 . Noah will say : ' 'I will 22. testify in the presence of your 23. might that the generation of 24. these men came neither from 25. me nor from 146</page><page sequence="17">Plate 72 1. the knowledge 2. those men 3. and he will bring them into their proper land 4. and he will build them 5. a holy dwelling place and 6. they will be called by that 7. name and they will dwell there 8. six hundred years in an 9. incorruptible knowledge. 10. And angels of the great light 11. will dwell with them. 12. Nothing abominable shall 13. dwell in their heart 14. only the knowledge of God. 15. Then Noah will divide the 16. whole earth between his sons 17. Ham and Japheth and Shem. 18. He will say to them: "My sons, 19. hear my words. Behold, I have 20. divided the earth between you.

Then others will come forth 14. from the seed of Ham and 15. Japheth. Four hundred thousand 16. men will go and enter 17. into another land and they will dwell 18. with those men who 19. were from the great 20. eternal knowledge because 21. the shadow of their power will 22. protect those who have dwelt 23. among them from every evil thing 24. and from every abominable desire. 25.

And again the Illuminator 9. of knowledge will pass by 10. a third time in great 1 1 . glory that he might leave 12. some from the seed of Noah 13. and the sons of Ham and Japheth 14. that he might leave for himself some 15. fruit bearing trees. And he will 16. redeem their souls from the 17. day of death. For everything which 18. was created from the 19. dead earth will be 20. under the power of death. 21. But those who ponder the knowledge 22. of the eternal God 23. in their heart will not perish. 24.

Then the God of the powers will 5. be troubled, saying: "What 6. is the power of this man who is 7. exalted above us?" Then he will 8. stir up a great wrath against 9. that man. And the glory 10. will transfer itself and will abide 11. in holy houses which 12. it has chosen for itself and 13. the powers will not see him 14. with their eyes. Nor will they 15. even see the Illuminator. 16. Then they will buffet the flesh 17. of the man upon whom the 18. Holy Spirit descended. Then 19. the angels and all the 20. generations of the powers 21. will use the name in 22. error, saying: 23. "Where did it come from?" 24. or "Where did the words 25. of falsehood come from, which 26. all the powers could not 27. find?" Therefore the first 28. kingdom says of him 29. that he was from 30. 31. 149</page><page sequence="20">Plate 78 1. A spirit to heaven. He was 2. nourished in the heavens. He received the glory 3. and the power of the one who is there. He came 4. to the bosom of his mother. 5. And thus he came to the water. 6. But the second kingdom says 7. of him that he came 8. from a great prophet. 9. And a bird came and carried the 10. child which was begotten and took him 11. onto a high mountain 12. and he was nourished by 13. the birds of heaven. An angel 14. came forth there. He said to him: 15. "Arise! God has given you 16. glory. And he received a glory and a strength. 17. And thus he came to the water." 18. The third kingdom says of him 19. that he came from 20. a virgin womb. 21. He was cast out of his city, 22. he and his mother. He was taken 23. to a place in the wilderness. He 24. nourished himself there. He came and he received 25. glory and power. And thus 26. he came to the water. 27. The fourth kingdom says 28. of him that he came 29. virgin 30. Plate 79 1. her, he and Phersalis 2. and Sauel and his armies 3. which were sent. And Solomon 4. himself sent his army of 5. demons to seek after the 6. virgin. And they did not find 7. the one they sought after, but 8. the virgin who was given to them. 9. She was the one they brought. Solomon 10. took her and the virgin 11. conceived. She brought forth 12. the child in that place. 13. She nourished him on the edge 14. of the wilderness. After he had 15. been nourished, he received glory 16. and power from the seed 17. which was begotten by him. 18. And thus he came to the 19. water." But the fifth 20. kingdom says of him: 21. "He came from a 22. drop from heaven. He was sown 23. in the sea. The deep 24. received him, gave him birth, 25. and raised him to heaven. He received 26. glory and power. And thus 27. he came to the water. 28. The sixth kingdom 29- says of him: "He 30. came into existence on account of 150</page><page sequence="21">Plate 80 1. Which is above that he might spread 2. flowers. She conceived from the 3. desire for the flowers. She 4. brought him forth in that place. 5. Angels of the flower-garden 6. nourished him. He received 7. a glory in that place 8. and power. And thus he came 9. to the water." But the 10. seventh kingdom said 11. of him: "He is a drop. 12. He came from heaven to earth. 13. He was carried down to caves of 14. dragons. He became a child 15. A sgirit came upon him. He 16. took him to the height, to the place 17. where the drop was from. 18. He received glory and power 19. in that place. And thus 20. he came to the water." But the 21. eighth kingdom says 22. of him: "A cloud came 23. over the earth. It wrapped around 24. a rock, and he came 25. from it. The angels 26. in the heaven nourished 27. him. He received glory and 28. power in that place and 29. thus he came to the water." Plate 81 1 . But the ninth kingdom says 2. of him: "Ffom the nine 3. Muses one divided off. 4. She came to a high mountain. She 5. spent awhile sitting there in 6. order to desire herself alone 7. that she might be both male and female. 8. She fulfilled her desire and 9. conceived by her desire. 10. He was born. He was nourished by 1 1 . the angels who are over the desire. 12. And he received glory in that 13. place and power. And then 14. he came to the water." The 15. tenth kingdom says of him: 16. "His God loved a cloud 17. of desire. He ejaculated 18. into his hand and cast 19. some of the drops into 20. the cloud beyond him. 21. He was born. He received glory 22. and power in that place. And 23. thus he came to the water." 24. But the eleventh kingdom 25. says of him: "The father 26. desired his own daughter. 27. She herself conceived by 28. her father. And she cast 29. a tomb 151</page><page sequence="22">Plate 82 1. out in the wilderness. The 2. angel nourished him in that 3. place and thus he came to 4. the water." The twelfth 5. kingdom says 6. of him: "He came from 7. two Illuminators. They nourished 8. him there. He received glory 9. and power. And thus he came 10. to the water/' But the 11. thirteenth kingdom says 12. of him: "Every birth 13. of their archon is a word. 14. And this word spoke a 15. command in that place. He 1 6. received glory and power 17. And thus he came to the water 18. that the desire of these powers 19. might be satisfied." But the generation 20. without a king over it says: 21. "God chose him 22. from all the aeons. 23. He caused a knowledge of the 24. undefiled one of truth to be 25. in him/' She* said: "He came 26. from a foreign atmosphere. 27. From a great aeon the 28. great Illuminator came forth. *i.e., the knowledge Plate 83 1. He made the generation of those men 2. whom he has chosen for himself to shine 3. so that they shine upon the 4. whole aeon." Then the seed will fight 5. against the power, those who will receive 6. his name upon the waters and by means of 7. them all.* And a cloud 8. of darkness will cry out in 10. a loud voice saying: 11. ' 'Blessed is the soul of those 12. men because they have known 13. God with a true knowledge. 14. They shall live forever and 15. ever because they did not 16. perish in their lust 17. along with those angels. Nor did 18. they fulfill the works of the 19. powers. But they stood 20. before him in a knowledge 21. of God like light 22. which has come forth from 23. fire and blood. But we 24. have mindlessly done every 25. deed of the powers. We 26. have taken pride in the 27. transgressions of our works. 28. 29. his works 30. black *i.e., all the waters 152</page><page sequence="23">Plate 84 1. is eternal. But these are 2. spirits. For now we have realized 3. that our souls shall die in death. 4. Then a voice came to them 5. saying: "Micheu, and 6.

You are full of 15. deeds which are not those of the truth 1 6. but your ways are full of 17. gladness and joy, even though you 18. have defiled the water of life. 19. You have brought it under 20. the will of the powers 21 . to whom you have 22. been given, to worship 23. them. And your thought 24. is not like that of 25. those men whom 26. you persecute 27. 28. desire Plate 85 1. their fruit does not wither. But 2. they will be known 3. to the great aeons because the words 4. of the god of the great aeons which 5. they have kept, they have not put 6. in the book, nor have they written them down. 7. But angelic ones will bring those 8. which all the generations of men 9. will not know. For 10. they will be on a high 11. mountain upon a rock of truth. 12. For this reason they will be named 13. "The words of incorruptibility 14. and truth of those who know 15. the eternal God in 1 6. wisdom of knowledge and 17. teaching of angels forever, 18. for he knows all things." 19. These are the revelations which 20. Adam revealed to Seth his 21. son. And his son taught them to 22. his seed. This is the knowledge 23. of the hidden things of Adam 24. which he gave to Seth, which 25. in the holy baptism of those 26. who know the eternal knowledge 27. by those born of the word and 28. the imperishable Illuminators who 29. came from the holy seed. 30.
