FErdon, Jr. Monographs of the School of American Research and the Kon-Tiki Museum, No. 24, Part 2, 1965. 'London. George Allen and Unwin Ltd., Price 8 gns. If the first Kon-Tiki Expedition to the Easter Islands was an epitome of intellectual curiosity and unparalleled adventure on the high seas by Thor Heyerdahl (later to be followed by others, the latest being the solo voyage of 30,000 miles by Sir Francis Chichaster) this volume is an ideal illustration of field archaeology today. It is no longer or should be what Edward Bacon said of Indian archaeologists 'Excavators dig like terriers; and one excavation completed, are hard at work on a new dig ' but a prompt report on the work, however, small or insignificant by a team of experts from several fields, besides the archaeologist. It is inter-disciplinary cooperation at its best.</page><page sequence="2">18 REVIEWS The long title explains what the report deals with. After Thor Heyer- dahl convinced the world that man could go to the Easter Islands from Europe in a primitive boat in these days of atom-powered ships, the next problem was to go to these islands and other islands in the Pacific and ascertain when man could have gone to these islands. Was is it in the recent past or in the dim antiquity, or was the contact with the civilized world almost continuous? Careful archaeological excavations alone could throw some light on these questions. Hence Heyerdahl organized and financed an archaeological ex- pedition to the Easter Island and the East Pacific. Not content with bearing this financial burden, he also assumed the burden of underwriting the cost of publishing the scientific reports emanating from the activities of the expedi- tion. This is no mean achievement. To publish a report of 512 pages on crown quarto, supplemented with 60 plates and 165 text drawings all printed on first rate art paper must have cost a fortune. One wonders when shall an Indian millionaire be fired by such imagination for truth, adventure and ade- quate scientific publication ! ! The first 12 reports are purely archaeological in character and deal with the explorations and excavations in the several groups of islands : Pitc- arin, Rapa Iii, Raivavae, the Marquesas, and Eastern Polynesia. Besides remains of flimsy houses or structures, the normal objects of stone such as anvils, pounders, adzes, scrapers, sinkers, shell scrapers, etc. - all indicating a stone age economy. The Marquesas Islands are interesting because they contain anthropomorphic monuments which Heyerdahl compares with similar manu- ments in an around Polynesia. Report 13 studies the cranial and postcranial material from Easter Island, whereas No. 14 analyses the Blood Types of Human Bone Samples, and on the basis of these are discussed the Blood Group affinities of the Easter Islanders and their relationship with the Polynesians. However, after considering all the evidence Roy T. Simmons has to say, "It seems evident that there were no planned migrations into Polynesia, and that the Polynesian people spread mainly by accidental voyages to all the distant Polynesian islands. Blood group serology does not prove to us who they were or from when they came. There is then no Polynesian problem, other than that created by ourselves, for it would seem that a handful of men and women from the east and the west, and not racial groups as we know them today, produced the Polynesian people as a distinctive entity amongst the races of Man." It is Thor Heyerdahls* discussion of the origin of the hieroglyphic script called Rongo - Rongo of the Easter Island that should interest an Indian scholar. For in the thirties Hevesy rocked the scholary world by postulating a relationship between the undeciphered Indus Valley script and that of the Easter Island, a distance of some 11,000 miles as the crow flies, almost 180Â° across the world.</page><page sequence="3">/';-=09 )(8* =-0/']</page><page sequence="4">20 REVIEWS It should be mentioned that the evidence now consists of the lost wooden tablets on which these hieroflyphic signs were carved or engraved, some paint- ings, and paper manuscripts which were written after the 15th century and discovered much later. While Thor might be rejecting Heresey's theory, it should be pointed out that the Indus script has a boustrophedon element, as has the Eastern Island script, and some more evidence adduced to say that it read from to right to left. Thors' own views on their origin and interpretation are, "that a system of inscribing texts in boustrophedon on wooden tablets was formerly known in wider areas of Central and South America. The tablets were used primarily for chanting religious texts at ceremonial occasions. The basic concept spread at least from Panama to Peru and a branch reached nearby Easter Island. Isolation permitted survival in this remarkably out of the way island com- munity, although the proper system of reading was finally lost through internal wars and linguistic disturbances. Through proto-historic and historic survival of primarily the basic ritual performances associated with the tablets, the most striking ethnographic conformities to the use of kohau rongo-rongo survive among the Cuna, whereas the magico-artistic conceptions embodied in the design of the characters, and the final specialization in reading them in the unique system of reversed boustrophedon, became restricted to the directly adjacent East Pacific areas of ancient Peru and Easter Island." Finally, how old is the occupation of the Eastern and other Islands by man ? Fortunately on this problem in which all are interested, the combined evidence of the modern scientific disciplines viz. Carbon-14, and the still later Obsidian Readings cross checked by European trade goods, historical infor- mation, it has been possible to group the sites and the associated remains into three periods: Early, Middle, Late. The last two are spread from A.D. 1100 - 1868. It is during the last two that obsidian, a natural glass-like rock was used. For the Early Period the present report gives no date. In every way a most welcome publication. - H. D. Sankalia.</page></plain_text>
