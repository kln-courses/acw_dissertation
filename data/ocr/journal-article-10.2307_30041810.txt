This famous definition of romance is at this point misleadingly simple; for what precisely is that system of "laws," "rights" and "privileges" to which the romance writer must adhere? Are those laws that delimit and determine the genre, that is, strictly aesthetic ones? The last paragraph of the same preface suggests otherwise. Here, in a judicious disclaimer (that has since become standard in fictional works), Hawthorne cautions his readers not bring "his fancy-pictures . . . into positive contact with the realities of the Milette Shamir lectures on American literature at Tel Aviv University.

In different terms, "[h]e trusts not to be considered as unpardonably offending, by laying out a street that infringes upon nobody's private rights and appropriating a lot of land which has no visible owner" and urges that the book be read "strictly as a Romance" (352-53). Hawthorne's definition of romance, thus, spills over from the purely literary into the legal domain: the "laws" that regulate its mode of representation involve those that safeguard the right of individuals to keep their affairs private, while the "privilege" of the imagination claimed by the romance writer protects his work from charges of "unpardonable" infringement upon that right. Indeed, this contiguity of the legal and the literary in the preface has inspired some of the most important work on the Hawthornian romance in recent years. Critics such as Walter Benn Michaels, Brook Thomas, and Gillian Brown have argued that the system of "laws" and "private rights" that the romance is defined through and is anxious to protect is the primary, yet residual, right of property.2 "Residual" because, as these critics explain, by the time Hawthorne wrote his romances, the near-mythical eighteenth-century legal paradigm of the right of prop- erty was no longer regarded as either philosophically indisputable or rhetorically sound. If the late-eighteenth-century patrician class marked the limits of governmental and societal intrusion upon the individual and secured his liberty and autonomy through rights of property, and first and foremost through real estate, the rise of the middle class and of modern capitalism in the first half of the nineteenth century consider- ably complicated this model. The logic of the modern marketplace no longer assumed the intrinsic value of real-estate, and consequently the Lockean notion that property based on labor and natural use of land secures the inalienability of personhood could no longer offer a stable legal foundation for the definition of personhood. As the "age of contract" gradually replaced the "age of property," that is, personhood became dangerously alienable, potentially appropriable by market relations.3 According to critics, Hawthorne's romance, "appropriating a lot that has no visible owner" and placing the disputed seven-gabled estate at its hermeneutical crux, tries to re-secure the vestigial defini- tion of personhood based on property, and to create a middle-class foundation for the right of property, in Michaels' words, "based neither on labor nor wealth and hence free from the risk of appropriation."4 What this critical emphasis tends to overlook, I think, is that in The</page><page sequence="3">748 AMERICAN QUARTERLY House of the Seven Gables Hawthorne seems to abandon rather than grapple with the problem of property rights. Although in the beginning of the book the question of land ownership seems central, by the denouement it becomes almost irrelevant. Neither the aristocratic Pyncheons nor the plebeian Maules are finally explicitly declared to be the rightful proprietors of the seven-gabled house, and instead an amalgam of people enjoys its fruits: Pyncheons and Maules, old generation and new, the propertied and the homeless. The claim to the Maine land is forgotten, and as the characters move from the disputed property to a more neutral location, we sense that the question of the right of property itself is displaced and neutralized. This transference of attention away from the right of property, I would argue, is as telling as its initial introduction. What the following essay wishes to argue is that the Hawthornian romance takes its shape from and contributes to a transition from the older, patrician paradigm of property rights toward an emerging middle-class legal paradigm of the right to privacy. When, in the preface, Hawthorne describes his romance as "laying out a street that infringes upon nobody's private rights, and appropriating a lot of land which had no visible owner," he is suggesting that romance, unlike a deed, possesses the power to appropriate only metaphorically, but that it has a literal ability to infringe upon one's right to privacy by making public the stories concealed within the house's walls. The contested plot at the center of the romance is in that sense not the physical but the literary one: Hawthorne asks who has the right to the private stories that haunt the gabled house's interior, rather than simply who has the right to own the land on which it was built. By mid-nineteenth century (as the epigraphs to this essay exemplify) middle-class thinkers began to base the autonomy and inviolability of the individual on a right to secure one's privacy, to withhold informa- tion from the public, to avoid being "exposed front and rear." As Brook Thomas has recently argued, the right to privacy was invented precisely in order to counter the problem of the alienability of personhood that emerged with modern capitalism, in order to keep stories about the self from circulating in the market and hence to resist the risk of appropria- tion by the market.5 The articulation of that right, one might add, involved not only the recognition of privacy as a viable legal category, distinct from and even inhospitable to property rights, but also an expansion of the very boundaries of privacy. Middle-class subjects came to regard not only their thoughts and beliefs as sanctified by</page><page sequence="4">HAWTHORNE'S ROMANCE AND THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY 749 privacy, like their ancestors, but also their domestic affairs, their actions in the home, the narratives around which family life was organized, as protected from public visibility and knowledge by right. Typical to the class "which does not want to be named,"6 the middle-class right to privacy appeared more democratic and universal than the right of property, to be enjoyed by all alike, regardless of financial status. If the right of property accorded a limited number of citizens a limited degree of relief from governmental and societal interventions, the right to privacy offered a more abstract, general, and symbolic protection to domestic life. But the right to privacy, I will argue, had class distinc- tions built into it. The concept of privacy always already implies the threat of intrusion by others, and is therefore a thoroughly political concept: it tends to set one group of people up against another group. The intrusion against which the middle-class home shut its doors was not only that of the government, but also of what Hawthorne habitually called "the multitudes," revealing privacy to be a specifically middle- class privilege, shaped by anxieties of intrusion from the top and the bottom of the social spectrum. Of course, the relationship between the novel and a middle-class insistence on the value of individual and domestic privacy has been the subject of several recent critical works. D. A. Miller and Richard Brodhead, for instance, have each shown that while the creation of domestic privacy is among the conditions of the novel, and while the novel regularly reproduces an ideology of privacy, it simultaneously invades the very space it sanctifies, operating as an instrument of social discipline and "policing." Miller tests this argument through British mid-Victorian novels; Brodhead is interested primarily in American sentimental fiction.7 But to what degree are their hypotheses applicable to other subgenres of the nineteenth-century novel? Or, rather, do all genres of the novel invade what Miller has called the "sheltered space" of privacy in the same way or to the same degree and effect? Does the American romance, a genre traditionally defined through its self- removal from the domain of the private family, intimacy and sexuality, share the efficacy of British and sentimental fiction in disciplining the middle-class subject? Using the example of The House of the Seven Gables, I will suggest, finally, that romance branches away from the novel precisely over the issue of the right to privacy: an anxiety over the potential intrusiveness of fiction and a desire to shield the domestic interior from governmental and societal policing dictate the very form</page><page sequence="5">750 AMERICAN QUARTERLY of the Hawthomian romance, endowing it with its distinctive ambiguity and imaginative latitude. Only during the last forty years or so has the right to privacy become central to constitutional debates in the United States. Seldom explicitly articulated in legal discourse prior to Samuel D. Warren's and Louis D. Brandeis's famous 1890 Harvard Law Review article "The Right to Privacy [The implicit made explicit]" (to which I shall return), and relatively marginal in constitutional law in the half-century that fol- lowed, the right to privacy began to emerge in the 1950s and 1960s not only as a distinct right, but as the most fundamental right that Americans possess. In 1950, Erwin Griswold, Dean of Harvard Law School, described the right to privacy as nothing less than "the underlying theme of the Bill of Rights," a radical assertion that was endorsed in the next two decades in Supreme Court cases such as Griswold v. Connecticut (1965) and Roe v. Wade (1973)8. Such controversial and publicly debated cases elevated the right to privacy to the position of a legal "trump"-a concept that often overshadows all other aspects of the legal debate-a position similar to the one occupied by the right of property in its heyday.9 In the face of this diffusion of the right to privacy, legal scholars have to struggle with a definition of the concept of privacy itself, despite the fact that no such definition was made readily available by the founding texts of American constitutional law. The right to privacy is based on an indeterminate concept of privacy, a "concept in danger of embracing everything" and thus "in danger of conveying nothing."" Other disci- plines, notably anthropology, sociology, and philosophy, have been attempting in the last three decades to define privacy, to taxonomize privacy issues, and to determine the cultural standing of the concept." In the effort to define "privacy" coherently and distinctively, attention is drawn to both the immanence and the relativity of the concept: while in most cultures we are likely to find a sphere that is partially free from direct societal intrusion on the individual, the borders of that sphere and its uses and meanings depend upon historical and cultural contexts. Therefore, in order to discuss meaningfully the development of a middle-class rhetoric of privacy in America, we need to look at the particular historical conditions that produced and surrounded</page><page sequence="6">HAWTHORNE'S ROMANCE AND THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY 751 Hawthorne's own use of the term. A glimpse at the range of meaning the term "privacy" encapsulates is offered by anthropologists who compare the expanse and shapelessness of the boundaries of privacy in post-industrialized America with privacy in non-industrialized cultures. The African Tuareg, for instance, is a culture so small, in which anonymity is so impossible and rigid social control so necessary for survival, that the private sphere is limited to the individual's mind. This sphere is symbolically demarcated by the veiling of one's face, an act that "bestows facelessness and the idiom of privacy upon its wearer."2 The veil limits privacy to the head, the space where individual thought, but not individual action, takes place. Hawthorne's ancestors in Puritan New England tended to restrict privacy to the similarly limited sphere of the mind. Indeed, Jiirgen Habermas pinpoints the Protestant reformation as the very origin of our modern notion of privacy. As divine authority was taken away from the church and given to the individual, Habermas argues, the religious conscience became the "first sphere of private autonomy."'3 Drawing its energies from the reformation, Puritan theology stressed the impor- tance of solitary reflection, and recognized the human conscience or mind as "a haven, where man and his God were alone."'4 The Puritans also recognized, for the most part, that one's thoughts are beyond the power of government or church to control directly and fully. But in the collaborative venture to create "the new Jerusalem," privacy had to cease outside the borders of that mental haven. The space immediately beyond was subject to invasion from legal authorities, who exercised residency laws, regulated visitors, lodgers and tenants, and supervised marital relationships; from church authorities, meticulously concerned with every overt manifestation of personal life; from fellow members of the congregation, constantly on the alert for offenses committed by their neighbors; and even from other members of the household (including servants and lodgers), since Puritan home life was often characterized by mutual surveillance. Members of colonial communi- ties did not hesitate to invade their neighbor's homes in order "not to Suffer Sin in My Fellow Creature or Neighbour."5 The hall-and-parlor house design popular through the seventeenth century created a domes- tic interior that facilitated this regular and rigorous vigilance, since it lacked a distinct division between public and private spaces, and since, with its minimal partitions, it did not offer individual privacy to individual members of the household.</page><page sequence="7">752 AMERICAN QUARTERLY Writing during the years of his self-imposed seclusion in his study in Salem, Hawthorne returns to Puritan New England in order to explore imaginatively the origins of his own culture's idea of privacy. Appropri- ately, he uses the emblem of the enveiled visage. "The Minister's Black Veil" (1835) imagines a fictional moment wherein a Puritan congrega- tion is forced into the explicit recognition of the head as a realm of absolute privacy. When the titled minister covers his face in the beginning of the story, he creates "a type and a symbol" for a space of private autonomy, now conspicuously shielded from "the gaze of multitudes."''6 The Reverend Mr. Hooper's act serves as an apt reminder that in his society the "head" or "conscience," is private, and that "on every visage," metaphorically, there is "a Black Veil" (384). The veil protects the head from the intrusions of official authorities (the "deputies"), from the inquisitive gossip of the congregation (the "multitudes"), and even from the sympathetic queries of his fiancee, family, and friends. All desire to lift the veil and probe its mystery in the course of the tale, and all fail. More revealingly, the narrator himself never unveils the minister's visage, and neither does the reader discover what it is, if anything, that the minister conceals under the black crepe. Refusing to appease the reader's own "hermeneutic desire," Hawthorne implicates the act of writing and the act of reading in the reification of privacy."7 He creates a fictional private space that is extremely confined, but absolute and impenetrable to the degree that neither writer nor reader probe beyond its apparent surface manifestation. Importantly, the minister refuses even to acknowledge that the veil indeed hides a specific "secret sin," such that would reduce the interpretation of the tale to the "opening" or decoding of this secret. A symbol without a concrete referent, the veil comes to stand for privacy itself, for that which is forever immune even from the writer's and the reader's authoritative perspectives. Read in this context, the problem that Hawthorne's text poses is not what the signified secret behind the signifying veil is, but where the text draws its limits, what area the writer is going to obstruct, self-consciously and purposefully, from knowledge. It is a problem that belongs more to Hawthorne's New-England, middle-class, mid-nineteenth-century mi- lieu than to the Puritan village: "The Minister's Black Veil" is a product of the widening of the borders of the private sphere in Hawthorne's own time and the problems of authoritative intrusions into that sphere that</page><page sequence="8">HAWTHORNE'S ROMANCE AND THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY 753 entails, problems that Hawthorne more explicitly negotiates, as we shall soon see, in future writing. In the course of the eighteenth century, the borders of the private sphere in the northern colonies gradually widened to encompass the domestic sphere. Although the (originally feudal) idea of the house as "man's castle" was imported from Europe by the Puritans, not until Puritanism waned was it extensively elaborated upon. The home's emergence as a secluded, protective sphere is reflected in the history of colonial town planning: Toward the eighteenth century, New England "compact towns," which prohibited living beyond a half-mile range from the meeting house, became increasingly scattered, and many residents now lived away from the center, turning their fields into homelots. Each house was now protected, by distance if nothing else, from public surveillance. Architecturally, as the eighteenth century drew to its close, the house provided a better shield for domestic privacy: the colonial hall-and-parlor design was gradually replaced with the two-story house, a model more spacious and better partitioned than its predecessor. The introduction of the hallway into the standard house helped provide privacy for its inhabitants. In addition, servants and lodgers were now occasionally separated in outbuildings.'18 The house newly created the possibility of an individual private space within, and also strengthened its walls against intrusions from without. Indeed, the idea of entitlement to domestic privacy and resistance to intrusion worked its way into the rhetoric of the American Revolution. In 1761, the Superior Court in Mass Bay debated issuing a writ filed by Charles Paxton, collector of customs, which would authorize officers to search any home. Prominent Boston attorney James Otis stated as part of his argument against the writ that "one of the most essential branches of English liberty, is the freedom of one's house. A man's house is his castle; and while he is quiet he is as well guarded as a prince in his castle." Otis relied on a growing emphasis on domestic privacy in English Common Law that stipulated, in Blackstone's summary, that "the law of England has so particular and tender a regard to the immunity of a man's house, that it stiles it his castle, and will never suffer it to be violated with impunity."9 Otis lost the case, but John Adams, who was present in the courtroom, wrote years later that "American Independence was then and there born."20 Not surprisingly, then, the best rhetorical expression of the desire to</page><page sequence="9">754 AMERICAN QUARTERLY expand the borders of privacy from "head" to "house" during the early republic period we find in the U.S. Constitution. Although, as I have mentioned, The Bill of Rights failed to address the issue of privacy as such, contemporary constitutional law nonetheless detects a "penum- bra" around the amendments "where privacy is protected."21 This penumbra defines the contours of a mental zone of privacy, in the First Amendment's freedom of thought and conscience and in the Fifth Amendment's self-incrimination clause that allows citizens not to surrender their thoughts to their own detriment. But it defines a broader zone as well, one that encompasses the domestic sphere, in the Third Amendment's prohibition against the quartering of soldiers without the consent of the owner, and in the Fourth Amendment's prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures. Relying on notions of limited government imported from Hobbes, Locke and Blackstone, rather than on the value of personal privacy as such, early American legal discourse nonetheless strengthened and shaped the rhetoric that designates the house as a sphere of privacy, a rhetoric that became more and more elaborate in the course of the nineteenth century.22 A number of economical and sociological factors we now recognize as contributors to this development: the ideal, if not real, enclosure of the home from modes of production, growing secularization and weakening of religious authorities' involvement with the inner func- tioning of the family, urbanization and the anonymity it created, increase in work mobility, the crystallization of the nuclear family-all eased the pressure on the home from both administration and commu- nity, and allowed the expansion of the "sanctity of the heart" into the "sanctity of the home" ideology. These factors are recognizably those that also molded the middle class in the North; and, indeed, the sanctification of domestic privacy, as Habermas reminds us, is uniquely a middle-class phenomenon.23 The wealthier class had a relatively large private space from the early colonial period, since, for example, its members often lived in the physical seclusion of larger houses and homelots. The emerging working class, on the other hand, did not enjoy privacy in the home (to the extent that the middle class did) even in the nineteenth century: dense living conditions and multi-family housing, and the control that economic factors continued to exert over personal life (consider, for example, life organized around a factory schedule or life as a servant), limited the ability of the working-class home to serve as a sphere of individual privacy.</page><page sequence="10">HAWTHORNE'S ROMANCE AND THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY 755 It is important to note that increasing privacy in the middle-class home necessarily corresponded to an increasing pressure on its walls, and that the desire to shield was accompanied by a growing desire to expose. Puritan authorities' restricting of individual privacy to the mind had all but eliminated the potential for seditious action, as any action, theoreti- cally, had to take place within a publicly controlled space. These authorities had little need, therefore, to invade the privacy borders that they themselves helped institute. Although torture, public confessions, and oaths were attempts to probe mental privacy and are often associated with the Puritans, their practice was not as common as we may tend to think.24 The middle-class expansion of the boundaries of privacy to the house, and thus to a sphere of actions and associations as well as of thought, enhanced the possibility of active subversion in the private sphere. Michel Foucault described a fear that, from the end of the eighteenth century, haunted public imagination: "a fear of darkened spaces, of the pall of gloom which prevents the full visibility of things, men and truths ... [of] the unlit chambers where arbitrary political acts . . . were fomented."25 Thus, the widening of the boundaries of privacy entailed not only the creation of an enshrined home sphere, but also an anxiety that this sphere contained an unnamed danger or horror. While exalting domestic privacy in its rhetoric, such a society needed simulta- neously to generate mechanisms that threatened to destroy it. Foucault's work on the rise of the European modem state, and particularly his work on penal and medical institutions, has shown, of course, how surveillance of the private individual does not ease with the appearance of the nineteenth-century bourgeois state, but is replaced, rather, with invisible mechanisms of power that are no less intrusive if less conspicuous. The simultaneity of an ideology of privacy and the amplification of modes of invasion of privacy certainly applies to the United States as well. The same catalysts, in fact, that served to expand the private sphere-urbanization, changes in the form of government, market and technological developments--also rendered these borders vulnerable. Self-regulated economy helped to enlarge the private sphere but also demanded intrusion upon it: economic relations in the city, for example, became distant and less reliant on personal acquain- tance and trust, thus demanding the intrusion into the private lives of business partners to provide the missing information needed for that trust. The rise of representative government similarly demanded infor- mation about private life, whether of persons aspiring for office or</page><page sequence="11">756 AMERICAN QUARTERLY simply to characterize a constituency. Statistics and bureaucracy devel- oped as a means of retaining information about private life,26 and technological advances, specifically in the field of communications, further rendered the private sphere vulnerable. The development of regularized postal services and of the telegraph, for example, while allowing personal communications to pass through an impersonal, anonymous medium for the first time, simultaneously increased the possibility of surreptitious interceptions of private communications.27 The expansion of privacy to the home therefore coextended with an immense growth of information about the domestic sphere and of modes of arriving at that information. A new form of power was thus engendered: the power of invasion. The emphasis placed by Foucauldian historiography on state polic- ing, however, may obscure the fact that the power of invasion was not understood as or imagined to be limited to institutional control. In his early fantasy about the problems of privacy, Hawthorne hid the Minister's face not only from the deputies, but from "the gaze of multitudes" as well. The concept of "watchfulness," of control exer- cised by ordinary citizens over each other through mutual observation and through the exposing of private information, did not connote precisely an invasion in colonial New England. The term "gossip," for example, had few negative connotations. In the sixteenth and seven- teenth centuries, gossip, to the extent that it was seen as negative, was related to religious "sins of the heart."28 It was not committed against one's neighbor, but involved the relationship of an individual to his or her God. Only in late-eighteenth century did gossip come to be regarded as a social problem, a "failure in social responsibility."29 As the house became a realm of privacy, gossip became a form of popular power, threatening to intrude on the house from its back entrance. The power of this "popular" form of invasion, like that of the "official" one, was greatly enhanced during the nineteenth century. The rise of the popular press, which from its beginning made it its business to report private incidents from the lives of citizens, multiplied the power of gossip a thousand-fold. The printed word added authority to that oral form of invasion, and gossip was now produced and repro- duced in thousands of copies. Thus, only with the emergence of newspapers (and later other mass means of communication) did "degradation of personality by true public disclosure of private intima- cies become a legally significant reality."30 Gossip developed from a</page><page sequence="12">HAWTHORNE'S ROMANCE AND THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY 757 mere nuisance early in the century to a real threat by 1900. The invention of instantaneous photography added to that threat: the camera enhanced the concept of "watchfulness," as it allowed not only the capturing of intimate scenes but also their accurate representation and their seeming potentiality for infinite dissemination in public.31 Even as it was defining itself as a private sphere, then, the middle- class home was subject to invasion on two fronts: the front-door intrusion by official authorities and institutions, forever suspecting the privacy of the house to be a cover-up for potential fragmentation; and the back-door intrusion by the "masses," who regarded the very invasion of that sphere a mode of exercising power, especially through exposing hidden depravity carefully concealed in the middle-class home. In the face of this two-pronged attack, legal discourse slowly devised a dual response. Constitutional law, which protects the privacy of the individual against governmental action, awaited the twentieth century to formulate its answer. But common law, protecting privacy against invasion by other private parties, made significant attempts to articulate a right to privacy decades before Warren and Brandeis offered an explicit definition of that right in 1890. Courts began to struggle with the articulation of a right to privacy as early as in the first decades of the nineteenth century. As legal historian Edward G. White explains, during the century privacy emerged as a residual category of law, covering such cases that teased the boundaries of traditional legal categories.32 A rhetoric of a right to privacy began to appear, in other words, in miscellaneous cases where the category of property and other primary legal categories could no longer provide a satisfactory resolution to new social demands. Among its earliest appearances, for example, were those in cases involving charges of trespass. The right of the home to protect itself from both official and unofficial intrusion was absolute and undisputed when the family in question also owned the house. But from early in the century, courts occasionally chose to protect domestic privacy from trespass even when such protection undermined the right of property. In 1822, for example, a court discussed a householder's "right of shutting his own door" even in the face of justified property claims of others. In the course of the next three decades, other courts questioned the right of</page><page sequence="13">758 AMERICAN QUARTERLY landlords to enter their property without consent of residents and the right of owners of property to retrieve it from the house of others without permission, and they asserted the right of occupiers to domestic privacy even if they were mere tenants or lodgers. "The purpose of the law" wrote one judge, "is to preserve the repose and tranquillity of families within the dwelling house" beyond property interests. More- over, judges now sometimes recognized that compensation for trespass should not be limited to harm to property, but also take into consider- ation "injury, insult, invasion of privacy, and interference with the comfort of the plaintiff and his family."33 A second domain where the right to privacy began to be articulated was in cases involving libel and slander charges. Until mid-nineteenth century, American common law recognized truth to constitute a defense in civil defamation cases. Following Blackstone, who claimed that a plaintiff could not collect damages in civil suits for statements that were true because the plaintiff "has received no injury at all," courts refused to recognize a harm done to a person by publication of facts that he or she strove to keep private. In 1843, Lord Campbell suggested to the British Parliament that it eliminate truth as absolute defense for libel and, around the same time, Thomas Starkie revised Blackstone's explanation of lack of injury caused by truthful publications. From that point onward, both British and American judges began to identify the harm done to a plaintiff by the mere act of exposure, increasingly favoring privacy over truth in resolving civil defamation suits.34 More- over, courts often ruled out an investigation into the truth or falsity of allegedly libelous statements because they wished to prevent the exposure of private lives of citizens in public courts that such an investigation would necessarily entail. The very structure of the trial, that is, was increasingly conscious of the citizen's right to privacy in his domestic affairs.35 A consciousness of the role language plays in the violation of privacy characterized slander suits as well. Here, judges explained, one must pay attention to the language used by the defendant to determine whether a slanderous act was committed or not. A mere innuendo, one court ruled, "cannot extend the sense of words spoken, beyond their natural meaning, unless something is put upon the record, to which the works spoken may be referred, and, by which, they may be explained in the innuendo." Therefore, a plaintiff could claim a violation to his or her privacy and reputation only when the language used was "actionable": unambiguous, mimetic (or "natural"), and</page><page sequence="14">HAWTHORNE'S ROMANCE AND THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY 759 specific in its details and references. A use of language characterized by insinuation rather than by direct accusation, and lacking in specific reference, would not be considered actionable in slander cases.36 What emerged from court rulings in trespass, libel and slander suits, there- fore, was a new language of privacy: detaching itself from the rhetorical foundations of property rights, it prescribed that the statement of truth is potentially harmful to private life and that an ambiguous use of words creates the possibility of talking about private life without endangering the value of privacy Revealingly, one of the primary legal domains within which the right to privacy made a court appearance was intellectual property. In 1848, for example, the highest court in the State of New York was presented with Hoyt v. MacKenzie and Others.37 MacKenzie and his associates obtained Hoyt's personal correspondence by breaking open a chest in which it was kept. They then published the letters, and Hoyt decided to take them to court, arguing that "he alone had the right to publish the letters he had written.""38 Although the lower court agreed with Hoyt, the chief judge of the New York Court of Appeals canceled the injunction issued by the lower court and allowed MacKenzie to continue publica- tion, claiming that "this court cannot restrain and punish crimes, or enforce the performance of moral duties, except so far as they are connected with the rights of property." Since the private contents of the letters had no "literary value," they could not be considered "property" and therefore be offered legal protection. This case points to a problem that will continue to plague publication cases in the next decades: if a text is only protected by law insofar as it has "literary value," (assuming that courts are indeed competent to make such a call) then any report of a citizen's private life can be published without the possibility of legal intervention, provided it is not "literary." In other words, so long as the right to a text is bestowed on its author--on the person who wrote it and endowed it with literary merit that made it valuable-the subject of the text has no rights to control its publication at all. Paradoxically, then, the more private a text is, the easier publishing it would be, because, not written for the public eye, it would tend to have less value as a commodity. A bit more flexibility was shown by the same court seven years later. The case this time involved a Mr. Woolsey, who complained that the New York Chronicle got hold of a copy of "a certain letter-wholly private in character"39 and intended to publish it. The court now</page><page sequence="15">760 AMERICAN QUARTERLY recognized that the publication "may involve whole families in great distress from the public display of facts and circumstances," such that were originally intended to "remain forever inviolable secrets." But the judges did not go beyond the rhetorical expansion of the right of property in their decision. "We must be satisfied," they wrote, "that the publication of private letters, without the consent of the writer, is an invasion of an exclusive right of property which remains in the writer, even when the letters have been sent." Furthermore, "[t]he exclusive right, which alone a court is bound to protect . . . is [the] right of property in the words, thoughts and sentiments, which [the] manuscript embodies and preserves," even if the text has no literary value. The court prevented the Chronicle from publishing the letters, but it did so by stretching the definition of property to include private feelings, events, and thoughts, not by postulating that Mr. Woolsey and his family were entitled to a right to privacy, regardless of whom the writer of their personal stories might be. We might say, then, that when Hawthorne recognized that the writing of The House of the Seven Gables potentially infringes on the private rights of those "inhabitants" and "communities" associated with its plot and that he would need to create literary mechanisms-"construct[ ] castles in the air"-to bypass such an intrusion, he acknowledged a value that law still struggled to articulate: the value of a text as an account of its subjects' private lives, unrelated to literary forms that might imbue it with aesthetic and hence monetary value (353). But since no firm legal boundaries were constructed as of yet to guard the domestic story as private, the occurrences described in Hoyt's and Woolsey's letters could hardly be protected under the claim to privacy. As I mentioned earlier, the right to privacy remained a residual category of law until later in the century, and neither the Constitution nor common law explicitly and consistently articulated such a right, although both offered a basis upon which these discussions could rely once they emerged.40 The first explicit argument for the legal recogni- tion of a specific right to privacy was made by Warren and Brandeis in 1890, in an article entitled "The Right to Privacy [The implicit made explicit]:'." The article was triggered by the yellow Saturday Evening Gazette's continuous embarrassing coverage of Mrs. and Mr. Warren's private social events, and especially of their daughter's wedding.41 It was specifically directed, therefore, toward creating legal protection against back-door intrusions on the private sphere. With new media</page><page sequence="16">HAWTHORNE'S ROMANCE AND THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY 761 technology, complained the writers, "what is whispered in the closet shall be proclaimed from the house-tops," and domestic privacy was seriously jeopardized.42 But Warren and Brandeis recognized in the article that the private sphere needed protection from "official" forms of invasion as well. Postulating that [p]olitical, social and economic changes entail the recognition of new rights," they concluded: The common law has always recognized a man's house as his castle, impregnable, often, even to its own officers engaged in the execution of its commands. Shall the courts thus close the front entrance to constituted authority, and open wide the back door to idle and prurient curiosity? (75, 90) By using the door metaphor Warren and Brandeis acknowledged the house as a private zone, and proposed the right to privacy as a means of assurance that both doors of that house are shut. Not only one's thoughts should be regarded as private, they argued, but "man's family relations became a part of the legal conception of his life" (75-76) and thus must be protected as well. Aside from reaffirming the borders of the private sphere, Warren and Brandeis presented a list of legal arguments aimed at distinguishing and defining a right to privacy. The most important of those was that the right to privacy is qualitatively different from the right of property: "[t]he principle which protects ... personal productions," they argued, ". .. is in reality not the principle of private property, but that of an inviolate personality" (82, emphasis added). In order to constitute a new right to privacy Warren and Brandeis needed to rhetorically detach it from the idea of property and thus illustrate its independence as a philosophical concept. By "personal productions" Warren and Brandeis referred explicitly to written texts and works of art; and, indeed, throughout the article the right to privacy is inextricably tied to common law cases involving libel and publication rights. They, too, made the important distinction between the protection against the publication of lies, and the protection against publishing truthful but personal information, defended by a right to privacy. Laws of artistic creation (for example, copyright laws) provided a second important legal premise. Recognizing a continuous tension between the private act of writing and the public act of publishing, Warren and Brandeis pointed to these statutes as offering a principle upon which a right to privacy can be based (79). Unlike the judges in Woolsey and Hoyt's</page><page sequence="17">762 AMERICAN QUARTERLY cases, they argued that the publicizing of private writing should be recognized as involving personal discretion and consent; again, not because writing is "property," but because it constitutes a textual extension of the private zone. If a man records in a letter to his son, for instance, that he did not have dinner with his wife on a certain date, it is not "the intellectual act of recording the fact" that is being protected by the right to privacy, nor is the actual product or letter, but "the domestic occurrence" itself (79). The signified contents were now detached from the actual letters on the page, and whereas a writer or publisher may "own" the text, the right to its contents rests with the person, or family, whose occurrences are represented. The legal right to privacy was defined through this distinction. Although the American legal system was slow in incorporating this new right into its debates, the force with which it finally has suggests that the grounds were well prepared in advance. The subtitle of Warren and Brandeis's article indicates that the right to privacy was already implicit in mainstream American rhetoric by the end of the nineteenth century, and that their role was merely to translate that right into explicit legal theory. This, combined with the connections they draw between the right to privacy and the act of writing, leads us back to Hawthorne, and to search for the emergence of that right in nineteenth- century literary works. How does Hawthorne help to engrain the expansion of the sphere of privacy in the imagination of his readers? What characterizes the tension between describing the interior house- hold and simultaneously insisting on its right to privacy? And what is the relationship between novels, and specifically the Hawthornian romance, and the invasion of privacy? Hawthorne's participation in the conceptual expansion of the bound- aries of privacy is most salient in The House of the Seven Gables in the recurrent metaphorical juxtaposition of the house and the human mind. His characters' psyches are symbolized by architecture: Hepzibah's brain, for instance, is like "poor, bare, melancholy chambers"; it is "impregnated with the dry rot of its timbers" (408).43 But Hawthorne goes beyond that. Like Poe in "The Fall of the House of Usher," he inverts the metaphor and anthropomorphizes the house: "The aspect of the venerable mansion has always affected me like a human counte-</page><page sequence="18">HAWTHORNE'S ROMANCE AND THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY 763 nance," he tells us at the outset; or "[the house] was itself like a great human heart, with a life of its own, and full of rich and sombre reminiscences" (351, 374).44 The reciprocity of this metaphorical structure implies the complete interchangeability of house and mind in his story: the house does not merely symbolize the mind, but has become, somehow, the mind. The anatomized house expresses a fantasy of the somatic impermeability of domestic space, while the architectured mind expands the space that the individual is entitled to claim as veiled from public vision. A veiled space creates an obsession with unveiling, as the narrator himself admits, for the house "has been an object of curiosity with him from boyhood" (359). The tension that this obsession instigates is apparent from the very beginning: we are informed that the "long lapse of mortal life, and accompanying vicissitudes, that have passed within" the house, though remarkable, have no space in this narrative. Instead we must be satisfied with "a rapid glimpse at its quaint exterior" (355). At once reproducing in us his own curiosity and restricting our vision to external surfaces, the narrator begins to sketch the ambiguous herme- neutic borders of this text. With "invincible reluctance," he (and we) will "loiter faintheartedly on the threshold" of the old house of the narrative, sometimes looking in, mostly substituting drama with specu- lation and fact with fantasy and innuendo (381). The imagined history of the house contains within it a history of private space as well. On the occasion of its inauguration in seven- teenth-century Puritan Salem, the House of the Seven Gables stood open to members of all social castes: under its doorway "trod the clergymen, the elders, the magistrates, the deacons and whatever of aristocracy there was in town or county"; in came also, carefully segregated by the doormen, "the plebeian classes, as freely as their betters and in large number"; and finally, the high sheriff and the Lieutenant Governor in person (standing in for King William himself) crossed the threshold, and made themselves "free to intrude" the innermost chamber of the house: its master's study (361, 363). There, amidst piles of his letters and correspondences-aptly connecting personal writing and private space-the corpse of Colonel Pyncheon was discovered by the Lieutenant Governor, the "multitudes" pressing on the official's back with "the eagerness of their curiosity" and creating "many rumors" and a "vast deal of noise" that spread the news of death throughout Salem (364). The dark secret momentarily hidden</page><page sequence="19">764 AMERICAN QUARTERLY in the house, the corpse in its great human heart, was promptly exposed by a coalition of officials, the masses, and the narrator himself. Generations later, Hepzibah, the present tenant of the house, finds herself vulnerable to the attacks of this very coalition. Although she lives in comfortable seclusion, Hepzibah's decline from gentility forces her to open a cent-shop in her home, and by introducing the market into her private life, she becomes target both to town gossip and to the physical intrusion of the town's people, who go "prying with vague eyes about the shop" (409). Hepzibah's largest menace, however, is the constant scrutiny of Judge Pyncheon, "a personage of mark, influence and authority," the embodiment of officialdom, whose "eye rested on the shop-window ... [and] minutely surveyed Hepzibah's little arrangement of toys and commodities" (400, 401). Long barred from entering the house from its front door, the judge will now try the other. This back-door opening into her private domain stimulates Hepzibah to fantasize about building a palace, where she would "look down from its highest tower on hill, dale, forest, field and town," protected on her literal and metaphori- cal pedestal (408). But, lamentably, Hepzibah's fantasies of patrician seclusion based on real-estate are no longer realizable. The Puritan owner of the House of the Seven Gables issued an open invitation; Hepzibah opens the door with reluctance and suffering. The ancestral guests have bred pernicious intruders, and the whole scene is now tainted with paranoia: Hepzibah tiptoes to the window, imagining "some bloody-minded villain to be watching behind the elm-tree, with intent to take her life" (385). This complicates the narrator's own crossing of the threshold (could he be that stalker?); thus, for instance, on our first introduction to Hepzibah we are barred from directly watching her and have to make do with imagining her from behind the closed door of her chamber. The narrator smiles: "[f]ar from us be the indecorum of assisting, even in imagination, at a maiden lady's toilet!" while, in the same breath, he minutely surveys the scene within (377). This moment of gentlemanly, vicarious voyeurism is in a sense a prototype for the romance's rhetoric code throughout. Gordon Hutner has identified in Hawthorne's writing a "dual process of promising and deferring disclosure," which "lends his rhetoric its characteristic ten- sion."45 In The House of the Seven Gables the tension of the rhetoric may be described as the product of the reversed strategy: Hawthorne repeatedly discloses information even as he refuses to own up to his act of disclosure. In describing the details of the store's interior, for</page><page sequence="20">HAWTHORNE'S ROMANCE AND THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY 765 instance, we do not learn that its stock included barrels of flour, apples and Indian meal. We learn, rather, that were "a curious eye, privileged to take an account of stock and investigate behind the counter" to exercise its privilege such would be its findings (381). Hawthorne's use of language, that is, reveals what he calls a "reluctance to disclose," as if the crossing of the threshold into the story involves an unpleasant and even morally ambiguous duty (381). It is not until Phoebe arrives that the walls of the House of the Seven Gables begin to ossify. Phoebe, as Joel Pfister recently pointed out, "serves as an advertisement for middle-class domesticity and the emerging middle-class itself'; under her blessed influence, the house becomes both joyful and protected.46 The problem of privacy seems to reach comfortable equilibrium: gossip ceases, the Judge's attempts at invading the house are obstructed. Into Phoebe's angelic frame, Hawthorne channels his middle-class ideals of the sanctity of personal life, ideals that he tried to realize in his own life and for which he recently earned the title of "shaman of domesticity."47 Pfister, Walter T. Herbert, David Leverenz, and others have shown how The House of the Seven Gables contributes to the shaping of the middle-class by dramatizing the separate-spheres ideology and prioritizing, in accor- dance with that ideology, gender dichotomies over class distinctions.48 Importantly, however, the value of privacy exceeds the prescriptions of the separate spheres ideology that allies the private with the feminine and the public with the masculine. While domesticity is perfectly captured in the character of Phoebe, the concept of domestic privacy is not easily or simply interchangeable with domesticity, and is not associated only with female characters. On the contrary: the character that most needs to learn his entitlement to domestic privacy is Clifford. Whereas the women of the house naturally thrive in the newly protected home, Clifford has a harder time adjusting. A relic of an older time, his adult mind shaped in the restricted space of a prison cell, Clifford is baffled by changes that time has brought and, although he does his best to "kindle the heart's house-hold fire," the walls seem to constantly melt down around him (442). Referred to as "the guest" for a large part of the book, Clifford's private mental sphere refuses to expand itself into domestic privacy. He sustains "a dim veil of decay and ruin betwixt him and the world," beneath which "far more of his spirit [is] hidden than revealed" even under the benign influence of Phoebe (442, 475). For Clifford, the alternative for seclusion in one's</page><page sequence="21">766 AMERICAN QUARTERLY mind is a complete lack not only of privacy but of personhood, a suicidal submergence into a "broad mass of existence-one great life- one collected body of mankind" that new technologies, such as the train and the telegraph, seem to have produced in the world outside his window (494). These technological innovations, forming an "all- pervading intelligence," attempt to make the whole globe "one vast head" and thus, by expanding the private sphere indefinitely, threaten to eliminate privacy altogether (578). Only by the end of the book, after Clifford actually takes the plunge into the outside world and experi- ences the homelessness of the city and the train, does he manage to lift his solipsistic veil and expand his identity to correlate with the domestic sphere. Hawthorne instructs Clifford in the course of the novel that a man's identity is residential, that a man without a home is a potential criminal. A crucial element in the narrative puts a twist on the process of the emergence of a middle-class right to privacy that the text traces, for the domestic haven is tainted with the presence of an in-built dark secret, and that secret is at once the crux and the burden of the rhetoric of privacy. In his most elaborate use of the house-head metaphor, Hawthorne describes how a person (Judge Pyncheon in this particular case) would build up "a tall and stately edifice" around the self. "Behold, therefore, a palace!" he exclaims in an oft-quoted passage: Its splendid halls and suites of spacious apartments are floored with a mosaic-work of costly marbles; its windows, the whole height of each room, admit the sunshine through. .... Ah! but in some low and obscure nook- some narrow closet on the ground floor, shut, locked and bolted, and the key flung away--or beneath the marble pavement, in a stagnant water-puddle ... may lie a corpse, half-decayed and still decaying, and diffusing its death scent all through the palace! (549-50) Like Mr. Hooper's veil, the walls of the house that the Pyncheons have built symbolically shield from public view a potential threat, a possible horror. The sole rightful penetrator of these walls is "a seer, before whose sadly gifted eye the whole structure melts into thin air, leaving only the hidden nook . . . and the decaying corpse within" (550). The questions that Hawthorne implicitly addresses are who that "seer" might be, and what he should do once he finds the nook in which the metaphorical corpse is entombed. In other words, who has the ability, the responsibility, and the right in nineteenth-century America to melt down the walls and expose the private to public view?</page><page sequence="22">HAWTHORNE'S ROMANCE AND THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY 767 The beginning of The House of the Seven Gables seems to suggest that "the multitudes," Salem's people, are assigned the role of "the seer." Through gossip, rumors, and whispers, they attempt to under- mine the standing of the House of the Seven Gables and of the patrician Pyncheons. By participating in the tradition of rumors about the edifice, by implying, in fact, that his entire story is an end-product of decades of gossip and popular legends, Hawthorne seems to align his own narrative with such intrusions. The domestic novel, Patricia Meyer Spacks has shown, has indeed stemmed from "gossipy" genres as such as the epistolary novel and biography, and it shares with gossip "the kind of intense interest in personal detail" and "may attempt to establish with . .. readers a kind of relationship approximating that of gossip."49 By making the private sphere of the middle-class home their subject, novelists find themselves collaborating with oral gossips and with popular press journalists against the powerful upper crust of that class. If gossip becomes a form of expository power in the nineteenth century, as Warren and Brandeis have postulated, then novelists may find themselves identified with social agitation. Indeed, some American novelists have made conscious use of the power implied in the role of the gossip. The urban expose novel of the mid-nineteenth century, for instance, attempted to undermine the political power of the growing middle class through deliberate acts of exposure. George Lippard, for example, one of the first spokesmen for the working class in America, has employed actual sensational newspa- per items in his novel Quaker City. Another story featuring a house- "Monk Hall"-this novel's entire structure relies on short anecdotes from the private lives of Philadelphia's middle class, drawn from the press, and aimed at undermining this class's growing political strength. Monk Hall, again a structural metaphor for the skull of its resident "Devil Bug," contains a dead man buried in its cellar that in the course of the novel Lippard exposes, literally and as a symbol of inherent middle-class corruption. Similarly, the antebellum sentimental novel attempted to exploit the connection between fiction and gossip for the challenging of gender politics. For example, in Fanny Fern's Ruth Hall (although the house is only implied, perhaps, in this title) the plot again relies on the unauthorized entrance into the middle-class private home. Fern's rhetorical strategy, like Lippard's, is to gossip: she tells private anecdotes of the life of characters who could easily be identified by contemporary readers as real-life personages. Moreover, Fern herself</page><page sequence="23">768 AMERICAN QUARTERLY (as well as her heroine, Ruth) writes for the popular press, and the "dead corpse" that she exposes is the small-mindedness of the middle- class home. But Hawthorne, unlike the socialist Lippard or the proto-feminist Fern, has no conspicuous agenda against the middle-class home. On the contrary, while recognizing gossip as one existing form of social discourse, he is careful both to stress what he perceives as the limitations of this form and to separate from it his own writing. "Tradition," or gossip passed on through the ages, Hawthorne explains, is by no means a dependable narrative source: "tradition sometimes brings down truth that history has let slip but is oftener the wild babble of the time, such as was formerly spoken at the fireside, and now congealed in newspapers" (365). He further hopes not to be "belied by some singular stories, murmured, even at this day, under the narrator's breath" (457). Clearly attracted to these legends, Hawthorne also rejects them as babble, unfit by their very nature to represent what he calls "Truth." This is one motivation, therefore, for Hawthorne's invention of the term "romance" to separate his writing from the novel. The desire to lay bare the home, according to Jonathan Arac, lies at the very heart of the nineteenth-century novelistic enterprise. Arac has argued that the novel in its heyday was closely allied in its aesthetic vision with both "writers of journalism and social polemic" and "the activities of the central agencies of government." The novel, that is, joined forces with both forms of intrusion on middle-class privacy. Hence, for instance, Charles Dickens's invocation of Lesage's Diable boiteux-the diabolic intruder Asmodius-as his mentor and muse. He calls for "a good spirit who would take the house-tops off" to expose corruption within London's homes, "for men, delayed no more by stumbling-blocks of their own making ... would then apply themselves ... to make the world a better place!" What Hawthorne's romance reveals, by contrast, is an ambiva- lence toward this reform-through-exposure novelistic principle. In "Sights from a Steeple," for instance, Hawthorne engages in an implicit conversation with the novelist who sees Asmodius as his hero. "Oh, that the limping devil of Le Sage would perch beside me here," the narrator exclaims, "extend his wand over this contiguity of roofs, uncover every chamber and make me familiar with their inhabitants! ... But none of these things are possible; and if I would know the interior of brick walls or the mystery of human bosoms, I can but guess."50 Romance, while</page><page sequence="24">HAWTHORNE'S ROMANCE AND THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY 769 desiring to penetrate the privacy of the home, nonetheless carefully distances itself from such a penetration by claiming for itself the supremacy of the imagination. It will ideally retain the novel's ability to see through the middle-calls home, without infringing upon its privacy and endangering its very existence. Hawthorne is further anxious to separate his writing from another form of intrusive power, that which we referred to as "official." The "authori- ties" in his narrative are embodied in Judge Pyncheon, the public man who intends to run for the governorship of Massachusetts, who is loyal to public service, devoted to his party, and involved with "remarkable zeal" in a number of organized institutions, such as the Bible Society and the Widow's and Orphan's fund (550). Judge Pyncheon repeatedly attempts to invade the House of the Seven Gables, and his constant presence on the threshold of the house poses at least as much of a threat to its inhabitants as the talk of the town. If gossip is associated with tales, rumors, and the novel, Judge Pyncheon's public surveillance is associated with public records. The official portrait of the Judge's Puritan ancestor, who bears an uncanny resemblance to the Judge himself, hangs in the central chamber of the house, surveying its inhabitants and reminding them of the patrician threat to their domestic privacy. But official records, Hawthorn stresses, are even less capable of maintaining discursive integrity than the "babble" of the masses. Writers of official capacity-the clergyman, the legal critic, the histo- rian-are not better qualified to tell the story of the house for they write "cold, formal and empty words ... for the public eye and for distant time . . . which inevitably lose much of their truth by the fatal consciousness of so doing" (456, 457). Intended for the distant future, such official acts of representation, whether oil-painted or textual, are analogous to the powerful men whose reputation they attempt to perpetuate. The latter, Hawthorne explains in his preface, are guilty of the "folly of tumbling down an avalanche of ill-gotten gold, or real estate, on the heads of an unfortunate posterity, thereby to maim and crush them" (352). Similarly, the cold words of the chisel handed down from previous generations would maim the story, like the centuries-old portrait of the Puritan Pyncheon literally threatens to tumble down on the residents of the house. Here, too, Hawthorne is careful to dissociate his romance from official records as he has from the novel. Precisely by refusing to implicate itself, eventually, in a discussion of property and real estate, by not clinging to the avalanche of ill-gotten gold, the</page><page sequence="25">770 AMERICAN QUARTERLY romance critiques official writing and its ruling interest of conserving power and property interests. In the representational world of Judge Pyncheon and his ancestors, the right of property is a privileged signifier, and the Judge derives his very raison-d'etre from his great possessions. It is, Hawthorne tells us, a "counterfeit of right," but its false representational power is so strong, that it imposes its control even on the "secret minds" of the less endowed (372). The right of property is thus antithetical to-and even subsumes-the right to privacy in the beginning of the narrative, because under its name the very sanctity of the mind is violated. The Judge, after all, is the real owner of the House of the Seven Gables, and thus assumes he should be granted free access to its interior. Con- sciously rejecting this empire of property rights aided by public record and real-estate titles, Hawthorne's romance is an attempt to disturb and reverse the relationship between property and privacy. When Hawthorne imagines a "seer," one before whose powers of observation the house's walls melt down and its secrets exposed, he has neither the gossip nor the official in mind, neither the novelist nor the clerk. In the chapters that lead to climactic discovery of the corpse, both kinds of intruders try to collaborate and create a united front against the House of the Seven Gables. Judge Pyncheon, having tried the front door in vain, now enters the house from the back. He manages to penetrate its interior physically, aided by Hepzibah's neighbors, who "have been eye-witnesses to whatever has passed in the garden." "The butcher, the baker, the fishmonger, some of the customers of [the] shop, and many a prying old woman" have told the Judge "several secrets of [the] interior" armed with which he now hopes to destroy the domestic haven of Hepzibah, Clifford, and Phoebe (555). But whereas in Puritan Salem such collaboration has managed to expose the dead body in the house's innermost chamber, this time it fails. The Judge himself becomes the dead body, and neither the authorities nor the town's people (although the butcher comes close) will finally be the ones to discover the bloody corpse. The person who does find Judge Pyncheon's body is Holgrave. Allied neither with officialdom nor with the rest of the town-he is "lawless" and an out-of-towner-Holgrave possesses the strongest</page><page sequence="26">HAWTHORNE'S ROMANCE AND THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY 771 invasive potency of all (424). He is a "lodger" in the House of the Seven Gables, and roams free in its very heart; he is a photographer, whose technology invades both the house and its occupants and "actually brings out the secret character with a truth that no painter would ever venture upon," he is, finally, a mesmerist--one who has the ability to penetrate that inner and most private sphere of all, the human mind (425). The combination of these elements turns Holgrave into the largest threat, perhaps, that the privacy of the house encounters; so large, in fact, that Phoebe initially fears that "he may set the house on fire!" (424).51 Holgrave's supreme powers of vision are comparable only to those of the narrator himself, the other presence in the book whose privileged point of view allows free travel in both the heads and the house of the narrative. A connection is often drawn between Holgrave and Hawthorne in his younger days: Holgrave's experience in a community of Fourierists, which led him to believe that "a family should be merged into the great, obscure mass of humanity" and that houses "ought to be purified with fire" remind us of Hawthorne's own unsuccessful experiment with Utopian collectivism in Brook Farm, a few years prior to his writing The House of the Seven Gables (510-11). Holgrave learns in the course of the narrative, though, what the older and more conservative Hawthorne believes from the outset: that the power of the seer needs to be used for the protection and even for the construction of domestic privacy, rather than for its violation and destruction. He learns, that is, to be a romancer rather than a reforming novelist. The embedded story of "Alice Pyncheon" dissolves the borders between narrator and character, between Hawthorne and Holgrave, between fact and fiction. The lodger's story duplicates that of the book as a whole: Alice's mind that "sphere impenetrable" that embodies domestic privacy and can only be betrayed by "treachery within," is invaded through the collaboration of her powerful patrician father and the lower-class carpenter, both eager to substitute her right to privacy with their property interests (526). Holgrave's narrative is indistin- guishable in terms of language from that of Hawthorne's. He, too, describes, for instance, the house's "pleasant aspect of life, which is like the cheery expression ... in the human countenance" (516). The main difference is that Holgrave's story poses a much larger threat to the House of the Seven Gables, for whereas Hawthorne stresses in the preface the fictionality of his tale, Holgrave is openly writing about</page><page sequence="27">772 AMERICAN QUARTERLY characters that the ontological world of the book are real, and whereas Hawthorne defines his story as romance, Holgrave intends to publish his in a newspaper, to inject his text with the power of gossip, and thus to merge the Pyncheon household into the "obscure mass of humanity." Unlike Hawthorne's romance, this expose "essentially follows" the "wild, chimney-corner legend" (522). Moreover, Holgrave's story provides precisely the missing generational links between Colonel Pyncheon and Hepzibah, the inside information that the narrator, as we recall, decided to rule out of his own narrative at the outset and to substitute with the exterior description of the house. It is thus especially significant that Holgrave learns, through the telling of history to Phoebe, "reverence for another's individuality," that he contemplates burning the manuscript, and that indeed he never publishes it (535). Rather than subvert the private haven, his story leads him to desire it. The invasive narrative potential of "Alice Pyncheon" has managed to penetrate Phoebe's mind, and, symbolically, the fragile domestic sphere that she embodies. But Holgrave decides to make an exit, not to carry this mesmerizing effect further, and to begin to contemplate building a home with Phoebe instead. The masterful intruder of the feminized private sphere would become its protective master. When Holgrave discovers a literal corpse in the house, he is faced with two options: to publish the crime by turning the evidence over to the authorities ("Let us throw open the doors!" Phoebe urges him, again illustrating the point that it is men, rather than women, that are the primary protectors of the right to privacy) or to keep the horror concealed in the house to himself. This moment is replete with legal implications: what right or duty does one have to reveal information? Does that duty surpass one's concern for another's private affairs? It is thus particularly important that Hawthorne has Holgrave opt for silence, and for keeping the criminal evidence to himself, and that, having matured into understanding of the values of privacy, Holgrave uses this knowledge to protect rather than destroy the House of the Seven Gables. The daguerreotype that he takes of the dead judge will not be put to use by either the police or the press; it will serve merely for Holgrave's own private enjoyment and for the protection of Clifford and Hepzibah. The moment of supreme invasion into the dark secrets of the house becomes, thus, an occasion for the strengthening of its borders-"[t]he Black moment [becomes] at once a blissful one"-as Holgrave confesses his love for Phoebe and makes his promise of</page><page sequence="28">HAWTHORNE'S ROMANCE AND THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY 773 establishing a new middle-class home (615). A domestic secret, there- fore, creates the foundations for familial privacy and fixes the couple within an impenetrable circle all of their own. But Holgrave, strictly speaking, is not the first one to find the dead Judge; preceding him, Hawthorne himself dissolves the walls of the house to gaze at the corpse. The strange and ontologically ambiguous "Governor Pyncheon" chapter disrupts the narrative and contains almost no action. Uncharacteristically to this romance, the chapter provides an entrance into the mind of the Judge in the hours before his death and gives us direct access to his thoughts. Uncharacteristically, also, it addresses its readers directly and continuously, urging us to participate in the intrusion into the Judge's mind and abode. With the narrator, we become the "enemy or mischief-maker" stalker, who "taking him thus at unawares ... peep through these windows into his consciousness, and make strange discoveries" (582). This chapter does what Holgrave will refuse to do: it slowly and painstakingly exposes the corpse to public gaze. From his lofty, "owlish" perspective, the narrator surveys the house and the corpse in minute detail. But as twilight begins to obscure the contours of the house, he himself begins to acknowledge the dangers inherent in his own power of vision and in the unveiling of the corpse: "There is no window! There is no face! An infinite, inscrutable blackness has annihilated sight! Where is our universe? All crumbled away from us; and we, adrift in chaos, may hearken to the gusts of homeless wind, that go sighing and murmuring about, in quest of what was once a world!" (589) The nightly intrusion into the mystery of the house has melted both the walls and the skull of individual privacy. Hawthorne elegizes the privacy of the well-pro- tected home from a position in a potential future when technology and modernity's "all pervasive intelligence" will annul the world, will turn it into a homeless place where no privacy exists, a kind of an apocalyptic relapse to pre-genesis chaos. His own power as a writer, the potential he has exhibited for penetrating the private to its innermost, participates in the proliferation of this "inscrutable blackness," and in the constitution of a universe which vastness makes it nothing. Hawthorne does not allow this momentary vision to take over his narrative, however. He insists that this part "must by no means be considered as forming an actual portion of our story" and therefore fulfills his earlier promise that when the "sadly gifted" seer confronts the corpse, he will leave the nook in which it is hidden intact (593). In</page><page sequence="29">774 AMERICAN QUARTERLY the pages immediately following his weird expose, he returns to a detailed, strikingly calm description of the house's exterior. Like Holgrave, who turns the moment of blackness into a promise of domestic joy, Hawthorne musters the remaining chapters for the task of rebuilding those walls that momentarily crumbled away. When Hawthorne described the last days of work on the book to his publisher in terms of "hammering away a little on the roof," he had patching up rather than an Asmodian lifting of the roof-top in mind.52 He ends the book, thus, with uniting Phoebe and Holgrave, and constructing a new and better home for them, for their intimate friends and for their close relatives, "A house of stone, indeed!" as Phoebe exclaims, far away from the town's prying eyes, as well as from "the eye of yonder portrait" who "rendered himself so long the Evil Destiny of his race" (623). The two moves at the end of The House of the Seven Gables-the move to penetrate the domestic haven even to its innermost, and the consecutive move to build a new house away from public gaze (and away from our gaze as well, as the story ends, implying that part of the happiness in the cliche "they lived happily ever after" comes from our letting the heroes alone)-evince the relationship imagined by Hawthorne between the writer and the right to privacy. Hawthorne's story is filled with tension that arises from the desire to stress the writer's inclusive vision on the one hand, and his self-proclaimed responsibility to participate in the production of privacy on the other. This uneasy coexistence leads Hawthorne to invent his romance genre, a genre that he defines in the preface as conveying "subtle" rather than "ostensible" truth. The romance is an attempt to do away with the fundamental problem of representing the unpresentable, of simulta- neously invading and protecting. Unlike the newspaper, the camera, or the novel, which try to ostensibly expose domestic truth and "thus at once deprive[ ] it of life," Hawthorne's genre wishes to recognize truth but to control its representation (352). The romance occupies a kind of a penumbral zone "where the real and imaginary may meet," neither a fully lit nor precisely shaded space, surrounding a dark spot of absolute, inviolate, privacy. Its "subtlety" is in its ability to take with the one hand what the other has given: to acknowledge the writer's power of invasion while gallantly refusing to negotiate its deployment as a weapon. Preceding Warren and Brandeis's own rhetorical attempt at a resolu- tion, then, Hawthorne's text contains the social and philosophical</page><page sequence="30">HAWTHORNE'S ROMANCE AND THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY 775 conflicts of the middle-class concept of privacy. His anxiety as a writer evolves not from inventing fictions, but from the risk of telling a recognizable truth; the same anxiety that accompanied Brandeis in the years following the publication of his landmark article. Protection against publicity of true occurrences, the main core of the article, collided with the First Amendment's freedom of the press. In a letter to his fianc6e, Brandeis admitted that he should have published a "com- panion piece" on "The Duty of Publicity." These doubts resurfaced later, when the now Supreme Court Justice speculated, in a Hawthornian language, that "If the broad light of day could be let in upon men's actions, it would purify them as the sun disinfects."53 The collision between the public duty to expose potential private depravity and the growing desire to emphasize a space of personal privacy is one that persists in recent social debates and problematizes our sense of what is, precisely, the right to privacy.

The dating of the formation of the middle class in America to the first half of the nineteenth century continues to be subject to debate, especially in light of recent work that suggests that</page><page sequence="31">776 AMERICAN QUARTERLY the term was not put in use until after the Civil War. In arguing that Hawthorne was a participant in shaping middle-class values in the decades before the Civil War, I am relying on the works of historians such as Stuart Blumin, The Emergence of the Middle Class: Social Experience in the American City, 1760-1900 (New York, 1989) and Mary P. Ryan, The Cradle of the Middle Class: The Family in Oneida County, New York, 1790-1865 (New York, 1981). 4. Michaels, "Romance," 157. 5.

A contrasting view of the relationship between the right of property and the right to privacy is offered by Walter Benn Michaels as a minor point in his essay "The Contracted Heart," New Literary History 21 (1990): 501-2, where he argues that in the beginning of the century the right to privacy constituted in effect an amplification of property rights rather than a departure from them. But Michaels himself concedes in a footnote that "at least one branch of privacy law... has developed virtually without reference to property rights" (526 n.13). Perhaps the overlap of property and privacy that he detects is symptomatic of a prolonged transitional stage between personhood defined legally mainly through property and personhood understood as encompassing more symbolic aspects as well. 6.

Flaherty claims that Puritans in fact enjoyed more privacy than is commonly assumed. He concedes, though, that their conception of the meaning of privacy and their opportuni- ties for privacy were necessarily different than ours. Compare with John Demos's A Little Commonwealth: Family Life in Plymouth Colony (New York, 1970). A combination of factors in the Puritan household, Demos argues, leads one to ask whether privacy in that society is a meaningful term at all (47).</page><page sequence="32">HAWTHORNE'S ROMANCE AND THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY 777 16.

Hillis Miller's, in "Theory-Example-Reading-History," ADE Bulletin 88 (1987): 46. In this essay and its accompanying response, "The Minister's Black Veil" provided the platform for a controversy between J. Hillis Miller and D. A. Miller and between the two critical schools that they represent. At issue were the contents of the space appropriated by the titled minister through the act of donning a veil, the contents of the psychic space he chose to shield from intrusion. J. Hillis Miller used "The Minister's Black Veil" to explicate a relationship between language and history: since the veil as a sign refuses to be determined, he argued, language and history can never be happily reconciled; since all a reader could ever encounter behind the sign of the veil is another sign, every attempt to fill in the historical contents of the story is at best falsified. To this deconstructionist argument D. A. Miller responded with a new historicist one. On the contrary, he claimed "The Minister's Black Veil" fully resonates with historical meaning. As we have learned from Foucault and others "how seamlessly our culture conjoins subjectivity, secrecy and sexuality," the veil cannot but be read in primary reference to the historically specific categories of patriarchal sexual repression and oppression. Each regarded the other as dangerously ontologizing the story, reducing it to a pre-formed, a-historical theory. What I would like to ask in this essay, however, is what kind of historical meaning we might read in fiction if we change the question we pose from an ontological to a spatio-epistemological one. My interest is in historicizing the borders that writers inscribe to define the spaces of individual privacy, rather than in attempting to decipher the elusive contents of these spaces. In that sense, it is the history of space itself that I will argue is important to a historical reading of fiction. 18. Flaherty, Privacy, 35, 51-58.

The growth of the census is a good example of that. David J. Seipp, in The Right of Privacy in American History (Cambridge, Mass., 1978) shows in detail how the census developed from a means of providing data for Congressional apportionment to a multipurpose tool providing data for federal government use and for business interests, in the course of the nineteenth century. Other historians show that despite the fact that the census became confidential in 1840, the anxiety over its intrusiveness did not cease. James A. Garfield stated in 1870, for instance, that "[t]he citizen is not adequately protected from the danger, or rather the apprehension, that his private</page><page sequence="33">778 AMERICAN QUARTERLY affairs, the secrets of his family and his business, will be disclosed to his neighbors... [or be] made the quarry of bookmaker and pamphleteers." (Quoted in "The Right to Privacy in Nineteenth Century America," Harvard Law Review 94 [1981], 1905). 27. These examples are drawn from Alexander Welsh, George Eliot and Blackmail (Cambridge, Mass., 1985), see esp. chaps. 3 and 52-72. Habermas bases the definition of what he calls a "critical" civil sphere precisely on this tension between the growth of a secluded private sphere and the growing interest in invading it: [b]ecause, on the one hand, the society now confronting the state clearly separated a private domain from public authority and because, on the other hand, it turned the reproduction of life into something transcending the confines of private domestic authority and becoming a subject of public interest, that zone of continuous adminis- trative contact became "critical" also in the sense that it provoked the critical judgement of a public making use of its reason.

In 1899 Germany, photographers burst into Bismarck's death chamber to obtain pictures of his corpse, to the great distress of his family. This led to one of the first discussions on the right to privacy (see ibid., 50). This real-life incident provides an interesting analogy to the fictitious scene in Hawthorne's The House of the Seven Gables in which the daguerreotypist finds the judge's corpse, an important scene for our later discussion. 32.

See, for example, Diane L. Zimmerman, "Requiem for a Heavyweight: A Farewell to Warren and Brandeis's Privacy Tort," Cornell Law Review 68 (1983), 292- 368. For an early case in American law that established that truth is no justification for libel see, for example, Commonwealth v. Blanding, 20 Mass. (3 Pick.) 304, 312 (1826). The court ruled that "no state of society would be more deplorable than that which would admit an indiscriminate right in every citizen to arraign the conduct of every other, before the public, in newspapers, handbills or other mode of publication, not only for crimes, but for faults, foibles, deformities of mind or person, even admitting all such allegations to be true." 35.

Additional cases are cited by "Privacy in Nineteenth Century America," 1908-9. The growing awareness of the role of court proceedings in violations of privacy resulted also in a new justification for excluding spousal testimony, to preserve "the sacred privacy of domestic life." (Johnson v. State, 63 Nuss, 313, 317 [1885], for example). 36. McCuen v. Ludlum, 17 N.J.L. 12 (1839). See also Sharpe v. Stephenson, 34 N. C.

One of Holgrave's conversations with Phoebe, the angelic protector of the domestic sphere, is especially telling. In response to his inquisitive remarks on Clifford, Phoebe replies: "I cannot see his thoughts!-How should I? ... I feel it to be not quite right to look closely into his moods.... I venture to peep in, just as far the light reaches, but no farther. It is holy ground where the shadow falls!" Holgrave, in turn, admits to her: "Had I your opportunities, no scruples would prevent me from fathoming Clifford to the full depth of my plummet-line!" (505). 52.
