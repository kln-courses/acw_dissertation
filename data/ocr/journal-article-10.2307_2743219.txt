<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mortuary Ritual and Mortuary Remains by K. MAURER TRINKAUS Department of Anthropology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, N.M. 87131, U.S.A. 27 III 84 The remains of mortuary ritual are of particular significance to archaeology. As social ritual, mortuary practices are struc- tured by social relations. Yet, because one of their common purposes is to deal with a corpse, they often leave some mate- rial trace which may become part of the archaeological record. The key to archaeological inference from mortuary remains to social behavior therefore lies in establishing reliable links be- tween ritual and its remains. The primary goal of this discus- sion is to consider one such link, the use of written records, especially those contemporaneous with the burial practices they describe. Mortuary remains are a common archaeological trace of a ubiquitous human behavior. Analyses of ethnographic data (Bartel 1982, Binford 1971, Saxe 1970, Tainter 1975a) have shown that the patterning of mortuary remains reflects separa- tion of an individual from the community and reinforces the intactness of the community despite loss of a member. In the process, the roles, or the social persona, of the individual are defined, as are the relations of living members to the deceased. Archaeological studies (for example, Alekshin 1983; Brown 1971; Chapman 1977; Chapman, Kinnes, and Randsborg 1981; Fleming 1973; Pearson 1982; Peebles and Kus 1977; Randsborg 1973; Renfrew 1973; Shennan 1975; Tainter 1975a, b, 1978) have established further that the material remains of burial are patterned as part of this procedure and that they can provide information about the structure of the societies whose members they contain. Despite ambiguous cases (Ucko 1969) and generalized reservations (Adams 1981; Renfrew 1972:433- 34), such studies have refined and strengthened an existing consensus that formal analysis of mortuary remains can give information on past social structures (Gilman 1981:17-18). This consensus will not be disputed here. Instead, the links between mortuary behavior and archaeological remains, the subject of recent methodological critiques (Bartel 1982, Braun 1981, Chapman, Kinnes, and Randsborg 1981, Pearson 1982), will be considered, in particular the use of written documenta- 1 c 1984 by The Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Re- search, all rights reserved 0011-3204/84/2505-000851.00. I would like to thank Philip Kohl for helpful advice on the archaeol- ogy of Soviet Central Asia and for access to literature not readily available in the U.S. 674 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="2">tion to bridge the gap between mortuary ritual and its material remains. These studies recognize, at least in passing, that archaeolog- ical remains are usually an incomplete source of information, since social structure is reflected in mortuary ritual which is only partly composed of disposal of the body. Associated ritual behaviors also contain social information but are not always reflected in recoverable mortuary remains. Elaboration and form of mortuary remains are therefore an incomplete indica- tion of elaboration and form of mortuary ritual. As conspicu- ous and universal rituals, however, mortuary practices are often recorded by both foreign and indigenous writers. Presumably, then, written sources can be combined with ar- chaeological sources to yield a more complete picture of mor- tuary ritual. Use of written records is often recommended (or their absence lamented) (Alekshin 1983:138-39; Bartel 1982:53-54; Randsborg 1981:117-18), even where corpse dis- posal appears to be a sufficient indicator in itself (Bartel 1982:55). This solution needs further examination. Archaeological re- mains of rituals, such as mortuary remains, have their own sources of complex behavioral and postdepositional variabil- ity. These have been discussed thoroughly, especially with re- spect to corpse disposal (see Tainter 1978), spatial variability in cemetery use (Bradley 1981, Chapman 1981, Goldstein 1981, Kinnes 1981), and the determinants of "petty" rank (Brown 1981). Several studies also deal with the manipulation of sym- boling, since mortuary rituals, like other expressions of status, are subject to manipulation as part of status-altering strategies (see Hodder 1982a and, with special reference to mortuary practice, Chapman and Randsborg 1981; Hodder 1982b, 1982c:10; O'Shea 1981; Pearson 1982). That written records are acts of symboling in themselves with similar kinds of prob- lems has received much less attention, although the use of written records as factual notation and as powerful ma- nipulators of fact is fundamental to the organization of the complex societies that produce them. Those which describe rituals therefore pose, at the very least, a double blind for interpretation. This is especially the case in political units which face the problem of welding together diverse and widespread popula- tions. Since mortuary ritual is role-defining, it also provides an opportunity for role manipulation. The imposition of par- ticipatory rituals, such as mortuary rituals, is a means to this end, and the codification of such rituals is a source of much written documentation. Since this originates in central organi- zations such as state churches, it may be as concerned to suppress as to record the variation in actual practice that the archaeological record reveals to us. This documentation there- fore contains systematic biases, aside from the inevitable errors and other inaccuracies, that are rooted in its sociopolitical milieu. Furthermore, it is not often considered seriously that ar- chaeological and written sources are the residues of fundamen- tally different behaviors. Although they may overlap in sub- ject, they speak to different audiences and do so with different purposes. Reliance on written documents in itself implies com- munication between individuals separated in space and/or time. Status-portraying and -manipulating strategies here oper- ate on a broad temporal and social scale. Archaeological re- mains of mortuary ritual are the traces of face-to-face com- munication, usually between those who interact on a frequent basis. In small-scale societies the gap is not large (Brown 1981), hence the effectiveness of participatory ritual and the general absence of indigenous written records. The very presence of written records signals a larger social scale and superordinate levels of duty-status relations. Thus, the social ties to be rein- forced in mortuary ritual correspond to only part of the framework of social ties comprising the society. The amount Vol. 25 *No. 5 *December 1984 and quality of social information in mortuary ritual change as the scale of societies and local social units diverges. In short, death is a universal and disposal of the body very nearly so. The expression of rank and station in mortuary ritual is very common. But a relatively small number of societies and organizations of a rather peculiar nature have produced the bulk of existing written documentation. This peculiarity is important for two reasons. Complex societies are archaeological subjects in themselves, and the va- lidity of behavioral inferences drawn from their remains is a legitimate archaeological concern. In addition, complex soci- eties have produced the lion's share of the written records and a significant body of ethnography (for example, studies of peas- ants and of ethnic minorities). They are therefore a part of the theoretical underpinning on which the inference of social struc- ture from mortuary remains is based (see Bartel 1982, Pearson 1982). In fact, the mortuary practices of some complex societies illustrate the divergence of the mortuary remains from mor- tuary ritual, since they contain eschatological concepts which oppose the social order of the living to that of the dead (for example, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, and Zoroastrianism [Pearson 1982; Randsborg 1981:106, 117]). For their faithful, death (or the end of the cycle of births) is a promotion into a more egalitarian society. Written documents emphasize this new-found equality, and the material remains of corpse dis- posal symbolize it. Grave goods are discouraged or prohibited, physical burial is simple, or cremation or exposure may be enjoined. Monuments may be a durable substitute, as in some European Christian communities (Bartel 1982:55; Pearson 1982), though even here the social structure expressed is largely specific to communities or ethnic groups, reflecting much that is not relevant to or recognized by the society as a whole. In other cases, such as in some Middle Eastern Moslem com- munities, elaborate monuments are not the general rule and, where used, are considered appropriate precisely because they symbolize spiritual qualities which are only partly, when at all, a function of social rank (for example, the tombs of Moroccan marabouts). This in no way questions the principle that the social per- sona of the dead is expressed in mortuary ritual or that mor- tuary ritual is a vehicle for status expression or alteration. The expression of rank is indeed present but in an "inverted" sense in which high rank and lavish possessions during life are ex- pressed in death with much nonmaterial symbolism and lavish nonpermanent display (feasting, elaborate hearses, flowers, presence of significant persons, etc.). The emphasis is heavily shifted from mortuary remains to mortuary ritual. Archaeological and historical sources are therefore com- plementary in the sense that they partly overlap in subject, although they originate in differing aspects of the sociopolitical milieu which generates both mortuary ritual and mortuary re- mains. If we know something of this milieu (as we must to use documents in a critical fashion and to frame appropriate ques- tions in the use of archaeological remains), then the written record can contribute to our view of some nonmaterial aspects of ritual, while the archaeological record shows us the varia- tion of practice. Seen as a component of recorded norms, varia- tion in the material traces of burial frequently will appear anomalous, a reflection of the "inadequacy" of our written sources or of the archaeological record. By contrast, seen as a partial but accurate reflection of the overlapping behaviors of mortuary ritual and corpse disposal carried out by and for the living, such variation provides a framework within which the differing contributions of archaeological and written sources may be combined to illuminate some long-standing problems. These two, by their contrast, provide further information about the social context reflected by mortuary practice. For example, mortuary ritual in south-central Asia between</page><page sequence="3">500 B.C. and A.D. 650 has been extensively studied on the basis of documentary sources. Archaeological studies have at- tempted to reconcile variation in the material remains with documented practice. Contradictions between the two there- fore have been explained away rather than used as a source of information on the societies which produced them. I would like to consider these contradictions in the light of recently revised concepts of their social and political context. It must be empha- sized that the following discussion presents no information or interpretation new to researchers of the archaeology of this area and period. Rather, the intent is to use these rich ar- chaeological and historical sources to illuminate a question of archaeological inference. The archaeological materials are ossuaries. Their interpreta- tion has rested largely on written sources concerning Zoroas- trianism, present in an early form by 500 B.C. and adopted as a state religion by the Sassanian dynasty in Iran and Mesopotamia between the 3d and 7th centuries A.D. The or- thodox Zoroastrian mortuary custom is exposure of the body until the flesh is removed by scavengers, followed by place- ment of the bones in a container, if the means of the relatives of the deceased permit this (Boyce 1975:326-28). Exposure has a long history in this area; Greek sources, including Herodotus (1.140), Strabo (11.11.3,8), and Diodorus (17.105.1-2), make reference to the practice of exposure among Scythian, Bac- trian, and Iranian peoples after 500 B.C. (These are not inde- pendent sources; Herodotus, for example, was widely quoted by his successors, among them Strabo [see Pyankov 1975].) Herodotus states that the practice was associated with eastern Iranians and was followed by some Persians in western Iran in his time (1. 140). A post-Sassanian compilation of more ancient Zoroastrian traditions, the Videvddt, describes proper disposal of the body as follows: "if it come to pass that . . . a man dies . . . they shall take the dead one out to the proper place whereto, according to the law, corpses must be brought, to be devoured there.... we lay the bodies of the dead.... [o]n the highest summits, where they know there are always corpse- eating dogs and corpse-eating birds . . ." (Darmesteter 1895:6 1, 74 [Videvddt 5.39-40, 6.44-46]). "An uzddna- (ossuary, usu- ally glossed astoddn) shall be made out of reach of dogs and foxes and wolves, not to be rained on from above by rain- water. If they shall be able, these Mazda-worshippers, (let it be) among stones or chalk or clay. If they are not able, let it (the body) be laid down, being its own couch, being its own cushion, upon the earth, exposed to the light, seen by the sun" (Boyce 1975:327 [Videvddt 6.45-50]). Another post-Sassanian Zoroastrian source, the Datistdn-i Dinik, describes use of os- suaries in similar terms (West 1882). A large number of clay ossuaries from Central Asia (primar- ily from the modern provinces of Uzbekistan and Tajikistan) provide archaeological evidence for the use of such bone con- tainers. These were at one time interpreted as evidence of Zoroastrian ritual (see Rapoport 1960 and, for a later point of view, 1971), since Zoroastrianism has Indo-Iranian roots and its sacred writings, the Avesta, contain many references to an eastern Iranian and Central Asian place of origin. Some of the Central Asian ossuaries are consistent with this interpretation. These are simple boxes, undecorated or having only simple decoration and generally conforming to the account in the Videvddt (Belenitsky 1969:fig. 121; Kosholenko 1977:99, fig. 29). Other ossuaries, however, have features difficult to recon- cile with documented Zoroastrian practice, leaving some doubt as to the kind of mortuary ritual that used them and the polit- ical context to which they should be referred. This has pro- duced competing hypotheses about the social matrix-the state structure associated with Sassanian Zoroastrianism- and, hence, about the aspects of social structure reflected in these archaeological remains (see Belenitsky 1969:2 15-16; Kosholenko and Lelekov 1973). For a decade or so, no satisfactory means of choosing be- 676 tween hypotheses was found, and the issue languished. At present, however, archaeological reappraisal of the sociopolit- ical structure of south-central Asia suggests a quite different view of the ossuaries, and, by implication, of the relation be- tween archaeological and written sources. One of the first re- sults to appear was an alternative to the Zoroastrian issue. It is clear that Zoroastrianism, which probably did originate in eastern Iran/Central Asia, was only briefly present there as the Sassanian state religion. Buddhism, on the other hand, became the state religion of the Kushan dynasty and spread widely in Central Asia with their empire between the 1st and 4th cen- turies A.D. (Staviskii 1977; cf. Schwartzberg 1978:145, pl.14.1). Buddhist mortuary practice involves cremation, after which the partly burned remains are gathered together and may be placed in an ossuary. Some of the Central Asian ossuaries may have been associated with cremation, and some have Bud- dhist-like features, such as a modelled figure of Shiva (Kabanov 1971:250). Another has a succession of figures be- neath arches (Frumkin 1970:126, fig. 31), a Buddhist motif seen in mortuary context on a reliquary from eastern Afghanis- tan (Colledge 1976:fig. 36). Furthermore, traces of Buddhist activity are found throughout Kushan territories. Former Greco-Bactrian outposts and fortified settlements were trans- formed into Kushan strongholds with stupas, sanctuaries, and elements of Buddhist decoration between the 3d century B.C. and the 1st century A.D. (see articles by Pilipko, Sabirov, and Zavilov and Osipov in Masson 1976), and new monasteries and rock-cut sanctuaries much like those found in India were constructed (Albaum in Masson 1976; Staviskii 1975, 197 7:232 -43). By the 2d century A. D. the large fortified city of Merv had a major Buddhist center with a large stupa and a monumental reclining Buddha at nearby Bairam Ali. Associ- ated with these was a hoard of Kushan coins of the 2d century A.D. (Frumkin 1970:147; Pugachenkova 1967:fig. 67). The areal distribution of ossuaries corresponds well to the Kushan territories and to Buddhist remains in Central Asia. It is not continuous with Sassanian Zoroastrian territory, since the re- mains are found in southeastern Turkmenistan (which also has Buddhist remains) but not in southwestern Turkmenistan, which links Central Asia to Iran. One therefore can ask to what extent the ossuaries represent Buddhist practice in Cen- tral Asia. This question is open to many of the same objections as is their association with Zoroastrianism. Many ossuaries have features as difficult to reconcile with Buddhism as with Zoroastrianism. Furthermore, the ossuaries are present long before the Kushans and, while their frequency generally in- creases through time, a particularly large number in southern Uzbekistan and Tajikistan date to the 5th to 8th centuries A.D., a century or two after the decline of both Kushan and Sassanian empires in Central Asia (Kozenkova 1961:258-59). Recent archaeological work has increased the number of known finds of ossuaries, but the chronological bias, except in northern Uzbekistan (Khorezm), is toward the later period. In fact, Buddhism and Zoroastrianism share an Indo- Iranian root that may be traced to Afghanistan and south- central Asia. The long history of the Central Asian ossuaries, covering more than a millennium, and their variable, heterodox form are consistent with a local evolution of mor- tuary ritual in the milieu out of which the orthodox forms of both Zoroastrianism and Buddhism ultimately grew. Although the orthodox forms have produced the bulk of our documen- tary record, this record was concerned with only part of the spectrum of actual practice. Attempts to reconcile the evidence of the ossuaries with documented practice therefore obscure important variation in mortuary practice. A look at the range of variation of the ossuaries, rather than selected examples, supports this view. They include elements representing much of the spectrum of Central Asian mortuary CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="4">practice, combining iconographic features in a fashion un- characteristic of their more stylized neighbors and providing little evidence of distinctive Buddhist vs. Zoroastrian practice. Although some are straightforward boxes of clay with figures of carrion feeders (Kosholenko 1977:75, fig. 28) or generalized representations of the dead (Kosholenko and Orazov 1965:44), others are entirely anthropomorphic, with individualized fea- tures which suggest portraiture, such as ossuaries representing an entire figure or having anthropomorphic lids (Belenitsky 1969:figs. 52 and 120). In fact, some ossuaries are associated not with bones but with figurines or life-size clay statues (Rapoport 1960, 1971; cf. Kosholenko and Lelekov 1973). Similar statues with individualized features are found at major sites of the last centuries B.C. in Bactria (Pugachenkova 1978:figs. 24-26, 29-30), where they appear to be part of a cult of heroicized dead kings or princes. Both the Indian Vedas and the Zoroastrian Avesta refer to propitiation of spirits of the dead using a word root meaning "valor" and suggesting a cult of dead heroes (Boyce 1975:118). Other ossuaries display Central Asian or Tibetan lamenta- tion scenes (Frumkin 1970:101, fig. 24; Herodotus 4.70-73 de- scribes a funerary scene such as this ossuary illustrates), which have parallels elsewhere in Central Asia in wall paintings and suggest a form of ancestor ritual. The converse is represented by demonic figures, demons of the underworld, used as decora- tive details or as representations of the dead on ossuaries (Be- lenitsky 1969:figs. 47 and 77). Symbols of sun, moon, and stars are also found as details on many ossuaries, as well as on a variety of small objects and in wall paintings in houses and temples (Frumkin 1970:100, fig. 23). A similar concept is expressed in the Zoroastrian Videvddt (for example, the quote given earlier), which specifies that the corpse should be "seen by the sun." In fact, the descriptions of cremation and exposure given in the Avesta and the Rig Veda (see Boyce 1975:111) are quite similar: fire and light are purify- ing agents, destroying dead matter and releasing the nonmate- rial soul to paradise. Paradise itself is conceived of, in both cases, as a place of light. Horse symbolism is also attached to that of death, of rank, and of light or sun. A section of the Vedas describes a special place reserved for those who sacrifice horses, the place nearest the sun (cf. Boyce 1975:111). Herodotus (1.216) mentions the veneration of horses among Scythians, while Strabo (11.8.6) associates horse sacrifice with a solar cult among eastern Scy- thians. Entire horse skeletons are a frequent part of grave goods in the kurgan burials of the steppe (see Jettmar 1967) and have been found in northwestern Iran (Ghirshman 1964:99, fig. 132); by the 1st millennium B.C. in the eastern steppe these were simplified to include only the skulls of horses (Jettmar 1967:145). An association of horses with mortuary rituals can be seen as well in a burial of human skulls with horse skulls in a Parthian capital city of the last two centuries B.C. in north- eastern Iran (Hansman and Stronach 1974:10-14). The Par- thians were, of course, an originally Central Asian group of Scythian affiliation. A secondary deposition of exposed human remains of the 6th century A.D. from the same site also contains horse remains, an unorthodox feature in a Zoroastrian-like context (Hansman and Stronach 1970). An ossuary of the 6th century A.D. from the area of Samarkand shows the same preoccupation with horses in the disposal of the dead, being modelled in the shape of a horse (Knobloch 1972:196, fig. 111). Finally, the Samarkand area in the 6th to 7th centuries A.D. produced a number of ossuaries which display what can only be called an iconographic riot. One example has a Sassanian- like griffon next to figures seated beneath arches, seen earlier in Buddhist context. Surrounding these are circular stamps, widely used on Kushan pottery in Central Asia and Afghanis- tan, and a repeated cross-shaped figure (Belenitsky 1969:fig. 78). This is a simple and common symbol with a long history of use in Central Asia, beginning by the Bronze Age (P. Kohl, personal communication) and continuing through the period discussed here. It was used, though certainly not exclusively, by numbers of Nestorians and other eastern Christians present in Central Asia by the mid-lst millennium B.C. Clearly, while some of the ossuaries may have participated in mortuary ritu- als of the documented forms, others display a range of varia- tion for which we have no comparable written record. The variety seen in the ossuaries has been attributed to mul- tiple "influences," to freedom of expression, to artistic license, and to colossal bad taste. The relatively late date of many of the ossuaries, however, suggests another interpretation. This syncretism is made up of elements of the official, state iconog- raphies of the surrounding empires of Iran, India, and China, freely mixed with local Central Asian and steppe iconog- raphies. Furthermore, the 5th century A.D. marks, in Soviet terminology, the end of the empires of antiquity and the begin- ning of the "feudal" Middle Ages in Central Asia. In the ab- sence of a dominant state, the political cohesion which shaped and made use of the better-defined state iconographies of the Kushans or the Sassanians was also lacking. Rather, the Cen- tral Asian princes sought to bolster their claims by tracing their descent from one of the larger, imperial powers and to recruit followers through lavish display. The ossuaries suggest that, in so doing, they drew widely on recognized iconographies of imperial authority from defunct and therefore no longer threatening external empires, incorporating them freely into a Central Asian context. If so, this wide-ranging syncretism should pervade the mate- rial remains of Central Asian society of the 5th to 8th centuries A.D., especially those associated with the competing princes. In fact, this is the outstanding characteristic of the material re- mains of this period (Gubayev 1978:260; Pugachenkova 1967:210) and appears to have its source in the palaces and public buildings of the many small, competing principalities which dominated Central Asia at this time (cf. Albaum 1960). In conclusion, the range of variation of the Central Asian ossuaries reflects the fact that they were a long-lived and wide- spread form of mortuary furniture pre-dating the state forms of Buddhism and Zoroastrianism. Their elements show both chronological and regional variation and yet are essentially paradigmatic at any one time, freely recombining motives drawn from a variety of cults (see Belenitsky 1969, Kabanov 1981, Kosholenko 1977, Kosholenko and Orazov 1965, Kosholenko and Lelekov 1973, Kozenkova 1961). The ritual behaviors associated with the ossuaries therefore cannot be determined from documented mortuary rituals, since the latter were unconcerned with the range of existing practice. In the first half of the 1st millennium A.D., codification of Buddhism and Zoroastrianism was, in large part, a political matter. This accompanied changes in state organization and involved ma- nipulation of role-defining rituals by expanding empires. The syncretism of the Central Asian ossuaries is therefore more than a footnote to the history of religions or yet another cautionary tale for already beleaguered archaeologists. There is no doubt that the archaeological record of mortuary remains and the written record of mortuary ritual inform us of changes in organization in the societies which produced them. They do not inform us of the same kinds of changes or of the ritual associated with these remains, however, since the conditions which produced definition of orthodox practice and, ulti- mately, the documents by which we know it were the result of a political process aimed at altering a part of that practice. As such, both the codification of mortuary ritual and the variable use of mortuary forms inside and outside of this political arena document separate, though convergent, changes of organiza- tion in the societies of which they were part.
