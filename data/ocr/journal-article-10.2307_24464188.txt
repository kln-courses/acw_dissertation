As a particular work is interpreted appreciatively, there is some attention to features that recur in many of Milton's works: the use of classical mythology, Neoplatonism, Patristic references, the theme of temptation, and the like. At times Professor M. V. Rama Sarma (Things Unattempted: A Study of Milton, New Delhi, Vikas Publishing House, 1982, 154 pp., no index, select bibliography, Rs 75 in India only) is also attentive to the autobiographical elements in the poetry, Milton's self-awareness of his vocation as a poet and his unfolding aspiration to become an unrivalled epic poet. The special value of the study is chapter 9, "Epics of Righteousness and Justice: Paradise Lost and the Mahabharata," which enlarges the author's essay, "Milton and the East," in Volume II of A Milton Encyclopedia. Though Rama Sarma does not propose that Milton knew the Mahabharata, he concentrates on five areas of resemblance between it and Paradise Lost in developing his comparative study. The first resemblance between .the two epics is the conflict of good and evil, of virtue and vice, of God and Satan. For Milton, the moral contest often takes the form of a temptation or trial, whereby righteousness is confirmed or developed and faith in God is manifested. In the Mahabharata the concept of virtue is more closely linked to a code of conduct, knowing one's role in life and adhering to it. Devotion to one's role and the preservation of right relationships are crucial to the concept of virtue, manifested in the Pandavas, the good forces, but absent from the Kauravas, the evil forces. The second resemblance is the epics' explanation of the justness of God's ways. In Paradise Lost and the Mahabharata God himself in celestial form is the principal spokesman. But also in both epics the deity assumes, or prophetically anticipates that he will assume, a human form. Thus, in Paradise Lost the Son's role as Christ is prophesied, and in the Mahabharata Krishna is both "the friend and guide of the Pandavas helping them in all their traits, yet he also reveals himself as the Supreme Being. In both epics the concept of God is anthropomorphic . . ." (129). The third resemblance between the two epics is their episodic structure, including in some readers' eyes the seeming inartistry or superfluity of the last books of Paradise Lost and the Mahabharata. But in Books XI and XII of Paradise Lost Adam learns of the process of regeneration after the Fall, and toward the end of the Mahabharata, the spiritual ascension of the Pandavas is described. The fourth resemblance is the concept of heroism. In Milton's epic heroism is defined and exemplified as faith in God, submission to his will, patience, and fortitude. Similarly, in the Eastern epic Yudhisthira, who embodies patience and endurance, is exalted above the warriors of the epic. Because ethical idealism and moral values characterize him, Yudhis thira may be likened to Adam, who finally attains to "philosophical calm and acquires spiritual enlight; enment" (137). The fifth resemblance is man's spiritual ascent, the topic of the didacticism of the last books of the two epics. Either the deity himself or divine emissaries teach man both ethical conduct and philosophical truths, while insisting all the time on complete loyalty to God. By "his comparative study of Paradise Lost and the Mahabharata, Rama Sarma has broadened the context in which Milton's epic is to be interpreted and understood. Albert C.
