<plain_text><page sequence="1">AGAINST THEORY BESIDE ROMANTICISM THE SENSATION OF THE SIGNIFIER ORRIN N. C. WANG Walter Benn Michaels. THE SHAPE OF THE SIGNIFIER: 1967 TO THE END OF HISTORY. Princeton: Princeton UP, 2004. Twenty years after its publication, we now know the intention of Steven Knapp and Wal- ter Benn Michaels's essay, "Against Theory," something that was not at all apparent dur- ing the furor that followed its claims about the irrelevance of theory and the ineluctable fact of meaning (or intention) in a text. Michaels's latest work, The Shape of the Signifier: 1967 to the End of History, retrospectively connects the argument in "Against Theory" to the social commentary of another of Michaels's books, Our America (1995). The result is a wide-ranging critique of postmodern (or, using Michaels's preferred term, "post-his- torical") left writing and artistic culture, along with a number of polemical observations about a variety of contemporary cultural and political issues, ranging from the meaning of recent sci-fi literature and contemporary photography to the arguments behind deep ecology and the movement to secure reparations for slavery. This retroactive connection involves a paradox, however, since Michaels acknowl- edges that his present understanding of "Against Theory" depends on a different temporal relation to the essay -what he later calls a different "subject position" -than what he had had previously.' But The Shape connects "Against Theory" to Our America by attacking the overwhelming presence of the "subject position" in critical thought today, which it claims is the theoretical consequence of transforming texts with intentional meaning into sensory objects that we experience from different subject positions. The primacy of "sub- ject positions" is also alleged to be the historical consequence (as recorded by Francis Fukuyama) of the triumph of liberal capitalism over communism, which signaled the end of struggles based on adversarial beliefs (what Michaels means by ideologies). The result 1. "The movement from questions about the ontology of the text to an insistence on the pri- macy of the subject makes a single argument out of what I have in my own writing treated as two separate arguments and two separate projects. ... So, although I did not understand Our America's critique of identity to be in any significant way connected to the defense of intention in "Against Theory," the argument of the current book is not only that they are connected but that each claim entails the other" [10]. Unlike "Against Theory," Our America plays no real role in The Shape; Michaels thus does not address a dissonance between both books' historical arguments, insofar as Our America finds in American literature during the interwar period a "nativist modernism" whose combination of culture and race provides the modelfor the postmodern, posthistoricist identitarian politics that The Shape critiques. Thus, in The Shape modernism is opposed to such politics while in Our America modernism is the historical expression of that very problem. See Sollers for one suggestion of a historical arc that would consist of both a modern (1920s) and postmodern (1960s) chapter to this dynamic [552]. I'd like to thank Jonathan Culler for his trenchant reading of this piece. diacritics / summer 2005 diacritics 35.2: 3-29 3</page><page sequence="2">:i, ii~f~i% ::@ i,!!% i~f~ ii',;i . . ..  ii . .. .................................. .............................= Siiii iN ....... ....

Yet Michaels's own intention rests on a difference. Michaels understands the purpose of "Against Theory" by seeing it from the vantage point-the subject position-of The Shape. (This is not to consider even the difference, or similarity, between Michaels's and Knapp's intentions. Does Michaels's retrospective articulation of the intention of "Against Theory" also include the latter's, so that Knapp's intention can only be gleaned through a book that he did not write, twenty years later?)2 "Against Theory" is therefore haunted by the future writing of The Shape, whose own political argument depends on its preexistence in the now-understood intention of the essay's twenty-year-old argument. A certain logic to this future writing has ramifications beyond Michaels's works. Dis- cussions of language and meaning are always haunted by what is already implicit within them, the political and social world, with that haunting presence generating, as well as being made intelligible by, tropes of spatial and temporal difference. But Michaels would dismiss such language, as one further purpose of The Shape is to do away with ghosts, with the phantasmic nature of postmodern politics and culture: the ghostly memory of history in New Historicism, as well as in recent literature and social controversies. In a word, ghosts and a universal riven by difference (as opposed to being shored up by dis- agreement) are examples of sloppy thinking, of illegitimate forms of sensation. By dint of its very pervasiveness in posthistory, its contamination of the constative, the sensory comes to be defined as the illegitimate. We can then agree with Michaels that the stakes involved in The Shape (as well as "Against Theory") are indeed quite large. For the question is what form any critique of politics will take, whether there are such things as ghosts, and whether an uncanny politics exists. The response to this question depends on how we register the intersection between sensation and meaning. Michaels's tack in both "Against Theory" and The Shape is to disavow, or regulate, as much as possible that relation, to argue against any suggestion that one might imbricate the other. Unspoken in either essay, though present in a number of ways, is how much this policing is a certain argument about romanticism: about a nonromantic understanding of literature in "Against Theory" and a nonromantic politics in The Shape; about a romantic generation of the literary that I call the sensation of mean- ing. As the reference to the uncanny already implies, the sensation of meaning is neither simply nor even necessarily phenomenal, something that Michaels does not consider in his own account of the sensory experience of different subject positions. This is itself part of another, more fundamental misunderstanding by The Shape, of the materiality of the signifier--and, specifically, de Manian materiality - as phenomenal experience. Misread- ing that term as the sheer meaninglessness of a sensory object, Michaels does not see how materiality is more the meaningless imposition of meaning through difference and in disagreement. His distinction between meaning and the nonmeaning of materiality, or sensation, does not allow for the possibility of materiality as the sensation of meaning, the sense of sense, the materiality (or shape) not simply of the signifier but of figure: of nonmeaning's resemblance to meaning, or to resemblance per se. As I argue in my conclusion, attending to such a dynamic, either to dramatize or to deny it, structures much of literary history's self-representation after the romantic era's own texts. As Michaels's polemics inadvertently clarify, the structuring of history, and posthistory, is also involved. Indeed, the literary history underwriting the very polemics of The Shape comes from such a rdcit. Far from a Fukuyama-inspired postmodern condi- 2. Peggy Kamuf speaks to this issue with her witty dubbing of the authorial agency behind "Against Theory" as "KaM" ["Floating" 4]. 4</page><page sequence="4">tion, Michaels's scenario actually adumbrates a basic problem between romanticism and modernism-as-modernity. To call The Shape polemical is an understatement. Michaels seems eager to pick a fight with almost everyone, including his erstwhile fellow travelers in pragmatism, the philo- sophical position most associated with the argument in "Against Theory." They and a variety of other thinkers are conflated together as a series of examples of the antifounda- tionalism that has replaced universal argument with difference. (Difference itself seems a conflation of the identity difference found in multicultural arguments, Lyotard's differ- end, and, perhaps, Derrida's diff6rance.) To be sure, practitioners of the various theories and literatures that Michaels critiques often make this same type of generalization. Yet this will not stop a number of people from responding to The Shape in polemical kind, from a number of different angles. One person's argument with the book will not be the same as another's. One might imagine, for example, a sustained materialist, in the Marxist sense, en- gagement with the work that would both converge and diverge from leftist responses to the book's critique of racial and ethnic politics. The theoretical generalizations and number of people likely to be upset by the book can thus be less polemically seen to characterize the genre of The Shape, a sweeping attempt at cultural analysis that focuses on the contemporary logic of late capital, a logic understood as expressing the break be- tween the modern and postmodern. In a very odd way, Michaels's book reworks Fredric Jameson's classic study Postmodernism, or the Logic of Late Capital, a text whose earli- est incarnations were contemporaries of Knapp and Michaels's "Against Theory." The oddity of this reworking comes from several sources: the replacement of Marxist Ernest Mandel by neoconservative Francis Fukuyama as the founding theoretical visionary of capitalism at the end of the twentieth century; the discontinuity between the theoretical and historical conceptions of Michaels's argument; and the neovulgar Marxist use of class that Michaels implicitly uses to argue his case against identitarian politics. This is not to say that Michaels endorses or aligns himself with any of Fukuyama's particular political convictions so much as to note that The Shape bases its diagnosis of postmodernism not on an economic, but a political, model of history. Jameson uses Mandel to outline the hyperbolic abstraction of value that inheres in late capitalism, a condition that underwrites a host of oftentimes contradictory cultural phenomena in post- modernism: the simulacrum, schizophrenia, the loss of historical consciousness, and so forth. Michaels, who has little to say about Jameson (or, curiously, the other left figure his argument for modern universal argument most resembles, Jtirgen Habermas), uses Fu- kuyama to see capitalism as a belief system that has won out against its most intractable nemesis, communism. For Jameson, the historical event that defines postmodernism is the ubiquitous penetration of global capital into the mind and nature. For Michaels, the historical event that defines posthistory is the fall of the Soviet Union, and thus the end of any real, sustained argument with capitalism. That one might analyze that fall through a Marxist model is not a question that Michaels, following Fukuyama, raises, as the point seems to be that the disintegration of the Soviet bloc ends, for good or ill, the communist argument, and, therefore, Marxist analysis. In other words, Jameson's is a Marxist ac- count of capital while Michaels's is capitalism's own self-representation of its triumph over the anteriority of Marxism. Michaels does not share in this triumph (nor, truth be told, does Fukuyama). For if modern history has in effect been an argument for capitalism, capital's triumph means diacritics / summer 2005 5</page><page sequence="5">the end of both argument and history. Not that people have stopped arguing now, or that they avoided identity difference during the Cold War; still, the end of the Soviet Union becomes the "occasion to assert at the level of politics . .. the end of or the irrelevance of or, in its purest form, the impossibility of disagreement" [184].3 This position also seems odd from a left materialist vantage point, insofar as political argument is made synonymous with ideological disagreement; posthistory is also the neoconservative end of ideology, or, more precisely, of "mankind's ideological evolution" [Fukuyama 2]. Of course, both Marxist and post-Marxist critiques have dispensed with ideology as a form of false consciousness. But Michaels understands ideology as a conscious set of beliefs, and its purpose as the choate articulation of those convictions. Michaels's own argument against capitalist hegemony thus ignores a history of ideology--from Jameson to Slavoj Zi'ek to even de Man -that in a variety of ways positions ideology against the coherent, self-transparent statement.4 For Michaels, ideology has to be a coherent set of beliefs because a more volatile yoking of the coherent and incoherent in language means a fatal (as well as mistaken) conflation of meaning and meaningless in language, as well as the collapse of language and belief into one another. This insistence is connected to another odd way Michaels and Jameson compare. If for Jameson his theoretical argument is the dialectical expression of his historical argu- ment, for Michaels the connection is not as clear. As Michaels seems to put it, the theo- retical argument of "Against Theory" succeeded, but needs to be revived in the form of a historical intervention: But even if it is true that no one any longer thinks that capitalism is wrong, it is not true that no one thinks that anything is wrong, and it is certainly not true that anyone-except in theory-thinks that there are no more misinterpretations. Which is just to say that, if history has ended, it has only ended in theory. Theory is already over in history. [81] As "Against Theory" argued, people argue and disagree, which means they necessarily interpret and understand meaning, which means theory as the metaconception of inter- pretation is not needed. The end of the Cold War and the onset of posthistory mean that argument, or ideological disagreement, is in some key sense over. But this is only true in theory, as "it is certainly not true that anyone ... thinks that there are no more misinter- pretations." Allegedly theory is already over, at least in the history of posthistory. Yet it isn't over if that history is defined by the political argument against disagreement and the theories of identity and culture that understand discord not as disagreement but as differ- ence. So theory is both over and still persistent, inciting The Shape even as the book reaf- firms the polemical trajectory of "Against Theory," that theory is no more. Historically and theoretically, The Shape is against nothing. The historical argument of The Shape is haunted by "Against Theory" either because theory is over, or because it's not.5 3. Still, see note 1. 4. One could also certainly argue with Michaels's view of the basically postideological nature of today's global conflicts. Indeed, it is difficult not to see the present Iraqi war as the occasion for ideology, vulgar or not, returning with a vengeance. When Michaels thus equates the war on terror with the postideological, one wonders what exactly the phrase "war on terror" means. Or when media commentators speak of the present conflict in terms of civilization versus barbarism, it's hard not to see the ideological nature of such statements, either using or eschewing Michaels's definition. 5. Indeed, the era before the posthistorical fall of the Soviet Union would be the 1970s and early '80s, when the time of "high theory" was characterized by intense disciplinary argument within the academy. If academic study has since become balkanized, high theory actually denotes 6</page><page sequence="6">One might also say that if people are still disagreeing in posthistory, if Michaels himself is counting on people (or academics and artists, at least) to disagree with The Shape, his polemic is needed as much as theory was in the world of "Against Theory." The problem is not so much whether there is too much difference and not enough dis- agreement as whether the difference between difference and disagreement, or between ideological difference and other forms of difference, is as unconditional as Michaels would like. Strangely enough, difference in this relational instance carries the possibility of absolute distinction that Michaels only confers onto disagreement, since the disagree- ment between difference and disagreement means that they might also agree more than Michaels wants to acknowledge. Things get no less complicated if we allegorize this as the relation between Michaels and those he critiques in The Shape. If Michaels disagrees with readers who (as he would describe it) only differ with each other and himself, what is their relation to him? If they disagree with him about difference, why does he need to argue for disagreement in the first place?6 If they and he differ over disagreement (and agreement), how does he overcome the way the disagreement continually finds itself faced with something exterior to it? Put temporally instead of spatially, how do he and they avoid the infinite spiral of differing about disagreeing about differing about disagree- ing, and so forth? I call Michaels's relation with those readers of difference an allegory, since it express- es through the trope of individual agents an opposition that could also be figured as what occurs between two different discourses. This is exactly what Michaels argues against, of course, since in his formulation people can disagree while discourses, or languages, can merely differ. That is his point about Richard Rorty and Jean Franqois Lyotard, who have sacrificed argumentation-and thus belief-for gaming: Hence the difference between losing a game and losing an argument: you don't lose at chess when you are convinced you cannot move your king out of check; you lose when, whatever your views, you cannot, within the rules of the game, move him .... Beating someone at chess has nothing to do with changing his or her mind. . . . That's why the redescription [by Rorty and Lyotard] of peo- ple who have different beliefs as people who are playing different "language games" amounts to a repudiation of the idea that people actually have any be- liefs. [189] Beating someone at chess has nothing to do with changing his or her mind, which would more properly be beating him or her at an argument. For Michaels, then, a statement like "beating someone at an argument has nothing to do with changing his or her mind" would be nonsensical, which could very well be, except that what it describes happens all the time; as Hume once observed, people lose arguments and still don't change their minds. (If Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion won't do, consider the last faculty meeting you attended.) Arguably, if the end of history exists only in theory, so does the changing of minds, or beliefs, by argument. In contrast, history is full of the discontinuity between a time of universal disagreement in the humanities, including the one generated by "Against The- ory," that Michaels wants once again to establish. 6. Thus, while Michaels cites Judith Butler 's essay in Contingency, in order both to acknowl- edge and dispute her own postmodern grappling with the universal, he does not consider what she and the other authors of that collection are formally doing: actively differing from and disagreeing with one another. In narrativizing such a stringent separation between difference and disagree- ment, Michaels must confer onto "Against Theory" the characteristics of an institutional origin myth, bringing argument back to literary studies: "The point of 'Against Theory's' callfor the end of theory ... was to give [readers at the end of history] something to disagree about" [80]. diacritics / summer 2005 7</page><page sequence="7">an argument's success and a change in belief, between the constative and the performa- tive. There are many ways to approach this situation, of course, with one notable avenue being through the very Marxist tradition of ideology, as varied as it is, that Michaels ignores in his narrative about the end of communism and the posthistory of capitalism's triumph. From the perspective of that tradition, ideological analysis actually begins with the end of ideology, as Michaels knows the term. This formulation is itself part of a larger issue about the way language and politics work in The Shape. Before facing this question through de Man's own particular sense of aesthetic ideology, let us consider one final way the book seems oddly Marxist: how Michaels counters cultural and racial difference with class difference, the social discord of economic inequality. Here Michaels does seem to be making an economic argument, or a political argument about the economic, since class difference is perceived to be more readily of a weightier ontological texture than cultural difference: The difference between these problematics is, as we used to say, essential, since insofar as exploitation is at the core of class difference, class difference is ineluc- tably linked to inequality, where cultural difference, of course, is not. Cultures, in theory if not always in practice, are equal; classes, in theory and in practice, are not. From this standpoint, the rise of culture, or of the so-called new social movements, or of the problem of identities and identification, or-more gener- ally-of the problem of the subject, has functioned as the Left's way of learning to live with inequality. [17] As Jameson himself noted awhile back, this has been a debate in, beyond, and beside Marxism since Eduard Bernstein in 1899 ["Actually" 176]. This is not to say that the argument does not have its own force in contemporary postmodern left politics. The de- bate's extended history does, however, highlight the question of Michaels's own polemic, whether class analysis is a means or an end in relation to his assertion about universal disagreement. That the answer to this question is not explicitly part of Michaels's argu- ment creates a dissonance in his book's analysis, insofar as we are asked either to agree or disagree with his polemic, without quite entirely knowing what it is--a situation made all the more strange by the apparent precision of Michaels's language and one that also quite famously characterizes "Against Theory."7 By in this case gesturing toward Marx- ism without really engaging with Marxism, Michaels also ignores arguments against the ontological purity of class as well as treatments of social antagonism that don't sim- ply see economic inequality and the conflict between two different classes of individual agents as given essences.8 But class inequality and class conflict have to be ontologically more stable than other relations that characterize the "problem of identity," since for Michaels inequality and conflict are in seamless continuity with the constative action of (dis)agreement, whereas those others only evoke the experience of difference. Hence the concluding critique in The Shape of Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri's Empire, where their putative "politics without beliefs" accedes to an "empire of the sense- less" (or meaninglessness), where the poor are transformed into a culture that can be ap- preciated instead of a class whose inequality one can argue against. That Hardt and Negri 7. As W. J. T. Mitchell writes, "Perhaps the most paradoxical and intriguing feature of 'Against Theory' is that an essay which argues that meaning and intention are essentially the same thing should be so clear about its meaning while remaining so inscrutable about its intentions" [Mitchell 3]. Michaels might say, of course, that this opacity is the intention, and meaning, of the essay. 8. Examples are legion, but see Hall and Laclau and Mouffe, Hegemony. See also Michaels's own argument against any transparent continuity between a class agent's interests and beliefs in Gold [179]. 8</page><page sequence="8">are in their particular way seizing upon Marx's own sense of the difficulty of the poor becoming a class is not Michaels's concern. More pressing for him is how class inequality is in continuity with adversarial class beliefs. Cultures are all equal, and thus their beliefs are also, whereas the opposite is true for the relations, and beliefs, among classes.9 The sharp contrast in this formula explains the necessary role of class in The Shape by pointing out what is conspicuously absent in Michaels's adumbration of identitarian politics: gender. Michaels does discuss sexual identity by way of Samuel Delaney's nov- els, but again in a way that demonstrates how, in this instance, masochism functions like a cultural or ethnic identity. (Michaels also does engage with Judith Butler, but most keenly over Butler's argument against hate speech laws.) Feminism, however, is notably absent from the variety of discourses of different bodies, languages, and histories explicitly cri- tiqued in The Shape. This is to be expected, given how much of the book's critique about race and culture replicates the historical study of identity in Our America.'o But another logic might also be at work, as the putatively stark, ontological contrast between class and cultural (or ethnic or racial) identity becomes immediately complicated by gender identity. Indeed, if economic inequality is not a given, that's first and foremost because of how opening up analyses to gender inequality register a more thorough (if not complete) sense of social antagonism. Likewise, of course, the study of gender has been exactly where the fact of essential identities has been most vigorously interrogated. The infelicity of characterizing gender as either ideological (in the way that Michaels defines class) or cultural (in the way that Michaels defines race and ethnicity) highlights this predicament. In theory and practice gender identity has marked the aporia of the equal and unequal, as opposed to their evenly calculable distribution. This is also a question of figure. If the troping of race allows Michaels to argue against the role of race in arguments for social justice, that's because a trope for Michaels means an ontological fiction, insofar as we don't so much argue whether a figure is real as simply experience it. Troping is, in fact, what culture is, what makes an ethnic or racial identity an identity, and why Michaels thinks such forms of subjectivity can be undone by the real of universal argument. Culture is in turn the very trope (or experience) of the hegemony of subjective identity over objectively real, social discord. This is thus less about the reality of race than an argument about the limits of figure for political argu- ment and analysis. Troping, however, is more the volatile interface between ontology and fiction, than simply a fiction that stands in for, and thus crowds out questions about, reality. Bluntly, one dismisses tropes of gender, and the troping of gender, at one's risk, something The Shape implicitly acknowledges by not following through with such an interrogation. This is not to say, of course, that other tropes like race cannot dramatize this condition, or that all tropes equally articulate this situation in a homogenized manner. In theory and practice, all tropes interrogate the trope of equality, which means all tropes are not equal. This does not mean, however, that one can then dismiss a particular operation of figure for simply being irreducibly figural. That is what Michaels is doing, since for him you don't argue with a figure, much as you don't argue with a culture or language." You instead identify it as such, expose 9. Compare Michaels's critique of Hardt and Negri's "poor" to Ernesto Laclau's more pointed questioning of the unsustainable homogeneity of the two's idea of the "multitude" in "Can Imma- nence Explan Social Struggle?" 10. For two sympathetic responses to Our America that still question Michaels's eschewing of any strategic use of either race or culture, how for him those terms function only as ends instead of means, see Wald and Brown. Such a line of query could certainly be applied to the present book as well. 11. Conceivably, this would be a more difficult observation to make about the historical argu- ment in Our America; it is precisely the theoretical argument in The Shape that opens the present book to this charge. diacritics / summer 2005 9</page><page sequence="9">it as something that is distracting us from arguing about what really exists, such as class inequality. If figures do hold our attention, it's not because we are arguing with them, or simply understanding them in order to comprehend the meaning, or intention, of an author. It's because we are enthralled by their unregulated spectacle, which means we are enthralled by our subjectively different reactions to writings, art, and politics, which now constitute sensory objects linked to neither the constative nor the cognitive. Strictly speaking, for Michaels, such objects are no longer even figures, or components of lan- guage, but instead things of sheer sensation. Hence the final overdetermination for the basic absence of gender in The Shape: it has been subsumed under the cultural body of a phenomenal materiality that does not evoke thought about the object but the particularity of experience by the subject. The Shape avoids the juncture between an explicit critique of feminism's relation to iden- titarian politics and a (gendered) argument for disembodied thought over thoughtless sensation by ... avoiding it. Appropriately, then, feminism is made missing while figure is rectified and sensation resisted.12 Rather than through an engagement with feminism, Michaels's exorcism of sensation is by way of a de Manian materiality that comes to stand for the linked postmodern mistakes of theoretical reading and identitarian politics. The choice of de Man is not simply a prestidigitation, however. A narrative about the politics of postmodernity does emerge from Michaels's consideration of de Man's terms, but one that exceeds the possibility of a simple end of sensation and a concomitant return to history and argument. Writing on de Man, Michaels asserts that: It is the single-mindedness of de Man's commitment to the mark instead of the sign-to the "purely material" as the "purely formal," "devoid of any semantic depth "-that distinguishes Aesthetic Ideology. Indeed, the replacement of the sign by the mark articulated in (although by no means unique to) Aesthetic Ideology is foundational for and constitutive of the aesthetics of posthistoricism just as the emergence of the subject produced by the same process is-once the subject has thoroughly grasped itself as a structure of identification - constitu- tive of its politics. [ 18] To place de Man at the center of a serious discussion about postmodern left politics is all to the good. And "single-minded" does capture something of the relentless nature of reading that unfolds in de Man's writings. That all said, it's somewhat stunning to come across an account of de Man that makes him the exemplary figure for the instantiation of an aesthetic subject at the start of the twenty-first century, as one of the main arcs in Aes- thetic Ideology is how the aesthetic records its own disarticulation as a founding principle of mediation in, among others, Kant and Hegel. As Andrzej Warminski points out in his introduction to the book, this dynamic certainly has implications for the efficacy of their notions (and ours) of a closed system of successful meaning [5].13 But this does not mean 12. This is not to say that sensation and feminism are essentially connected-just that sen- sation, as well as the body, are made intelligible by various narratives of gender, historical and otherwise. See Redfield, Politics 34-40. 13. For an extended discussion about how the aesthetic is thus not simply ideology but the site of its own self-referential impasse, see Redfield, Phantom 1-37. For a recent, vigorous argument that de Man's thought is precisely not about the instantiation of the subject, see Terada. 10</page><page sequence="10">the aesthetic is meaningless because it's intentionally opposed to meaning, or that that is the case because the aesthetic is not about understanding but sensory feeling -far from it. The aesthetic is rather for de Man the attempt to unite such understanding and feeling; as Jonathan Culler puts it, aesthetic ideology "imposes, even violently, continuity between perception and cognition, form and idea ..." [781]. As such an assertion, aesthetic ide- ology is neither a belief in, nor an argument for, the aesthetic as the positive identity of meaninglessness. Michaels seems, however, to understand meaninglessness in de Man (if not the title of de Man's book) in precisely this way. There is the signifier and then there is the mate- rial of the signifier, which is meaningless. According to The Shape, de Man and others valorize this material over signification, which means we as readers are left with only experiencing this material in different ways, from different perspectives, instead of un- derstanding, and arguing over, meaning. Similarly, the celebration of the many meanings of multiculturalism is in fact the fetishization of experiencing many cultures differently, as that is all we are left with after giving up on meaning and disagreement. On one side lies language as the understanding of meaning; on the other lies the physical materiality of language, which is not to be confused with language. The two are not the same because such materiality can only be experienced, neither read nor understood. It is not language but literal matter, meaningless by definition. For Michaels's de Man, the aesthetic is con- stituted precisely by the valorized experience of this materiality. It is certainly true that many understand the materiality of the signifier in ways that resemble its exposition in The Shape. It is also true that, in the resurgent textual studies of the last decade, materiality is indeed about matter (paper, ink, or screen), though a matter that is thought to be integral to language and meaning. But de Manian materiality is not in any simple way a materiality of matter, especially not phenomenal matter; the title of a recent collection on de Man, Material Events, which Michaels cites, suggests as much.'4 Indeed, the essay from which Michaels quotes the phrases "pure materiality" and the "purely formal, devoid of any semantic depth" argues that the "material vision" of the sublime remains aggressively unreconciled with the desire in Kant's third Critique to ad- equate the sublime's inner noumenal generation with its exterior, phenomenal expression [Aesthetic 83]. This resistance is itself part of a larger blockage. As de Man concludes the essay, "The bottom line, in Kant as well as in Hegel, is the prosaic materiality of the letter, and no degree of obfuscation or ideology can transform this materiality into the phenomenal cognition of aesthetic judgement" [90]. The prosaic is not the quotidian fact of matter but language's resistance to its own sublimation, its disarticulation of the achievement of phenomenal cognition, and thus of the aesthetic experience of the object that organizes Michael's polemic in The Shape. Of course, Michael's aesthetic experience is not simply Kant's, as the latter's asso- ciation of the universal with aesthetic judgment actually grounds the world of agreement that Michaels wants to champion against the relativity of sensory experience that defines his own sense of the aesthetic. Michaels gestures toward these connections himself when he approvingly uses W. K. Wimsatt and Monroe Beardsley's example of how Coleridge's 14. See especially Warminski's and Derrida's contributions to Material Events [8, 281], as well as especially the editors' introduction to the collection, "A Materiality without Matter? " [vii-xxv]. Materiality is, of course, a difficult term in de Man's later writing, most significantly in Aesthetic; readers will see how this essay tries to contribute to an understanding of the term and how that overlaps and diverges from other approaches, such as those presented in Material Events. For a complementary discussion of nonmaterial materiality in German Idealism, see Rajan 's introduction to Idealism without Absolutes [1-3]. In a Marxist materialism, of course, materiality is not about matter but the signification of social relations.

Both questions, however, invoke a phenomenal dimension that de Man argues Kant's material- ity disrupts. As de Man says elsewhere in Aesthetic Ideology, the "formalism" of Kant's materiality is not only "a-referential" but also "a-phenomenal" [128]. The material in Aesthetic Ideology is not something one simply feels. For Michaels, however, de Man's material demonstration of the failure of phenom- enal cognition as meaning must dramatize the triumph of sensory feeling over cognition, the instantiation of materiality as phenomenal meaninglessness. Thus when de Man be- gins his key reading of Kant's architectonic description of the sky and ocean as examples of the sublime, and wonders how that account relates to other "allusions to sensory ap- pearance" in Kant that try to describe the sublime, Michaels uses de Man's phrase, "sen- sory appearance," to authorize his understanding of Susan Howe's analysis of an Emily Dickinson facsimile as "not just ... convey[ing] the meaning of the text to the reader but also... reproduc[ing] the experience of its physical features" [4]. For Michaels's de Man, "the purely material ... is everything [e.g., a blank page or border] that can be seen by the reader" [6]. Is the experience of such physical properties really the same, however, as regarding Kant's ocean the way that the philosopher says poets do? For de Man, Kant's description conveys "how things are to the eye, in the redundancy of their appearance to the eye and not to the mind, as in the redundant Augenschein, to be understood in opposi- tion to Hegel's Ideenschein, or sensory appearance of the idea; Augenschein, in which the eye, tautologically, is named twice, as eye itself and what appears to the eye" [82]. De Man's point is to describe a material vision discontinuous with any cognitive or semantic action. But as the discontinuity between eye and mind escalates in his passage, it also be- comes increasingly difficult to attach the eye to Michaels's experiential subject. The eye stands alone, explicitly divorced from solar meaning but also detached from any seeing reader (or poet, for that matter), simply the "formal mathematization or geometrization of pure optics" [83]. This might be nonsensical to Michaels, but if that is the case the reason is because the subjective experience he decries, the visual or tactile perception of a blank page, is still attached more to Hegel's "sensory appearance of ideas" than to what de Man's Kant describes. Materiality in de Man is by no means a simple notion. That Michaels translates the term into a physical substance speaks, however, to the very fact of different discourses that Michaels wants to deny. In the language of The Shape, Michaels neither understands nor disagrees with de Man so much as he differs from him. More than any sustained argu- ment with what de Man actually says, this predicament enables Michaels to cast de Man in the central role of the book's polemic."5 This difference can be measured in another way. As much as Michaels argues for meaning and intention in a text, he actually seems uninterested in what de Man might have intended or meant in Aesthetic Ideology.'6 There is no indication in The Shape as to how much Michael's reading of de Man diverges radically from what Aesthetic Ideology argues about aesthetics and materiality, or from what others have said that argument to be. Michael's own reading of de Man's intention achieves an odd state of being, less an unavoidable condition of what is right arrived at by an inevitable line of reasoning and more a phantom form of denotation underwritten by the catachresis of what The Shape 15. A similar difference occurs in Michaels's summary of Derrida's language of the "mark" as yet another example of a physical materiality that can only be experienced, not understood, insofar as Michaels ignores how Derrida's argument about the mark with John Searle and his earlier engagement with J. L. Austin is fundamentally connected to his overlapping critique of the phenomenal character of language in Edmund Husserl. See Derrida, Margins 155-73, 307-30. 16. I am grateful to Jonathan Culler for this observation. diacritics / summer 2005 13</page><page sequence="13">calls "mak[ing] sense" [47]. Michaels labels this phantom form "meaning," but it seems more about his difference from de Man than anything else. Michaels's and de Man's difference does enable the severing of "sensory appearance" from "allusions to sensory appearance," a mutilation quite like the severed Kantian hu- man limb that Aesthetic Ideology uses to argue for the nonorganic and nonteleological nature of materiality. (To the degree that Michaels restores to the severed phrase the semantic wholeness of human perception, he actually enacts the aesthetic ideology that the book describes.) That act transforms an allusion to sensory appearance into, literally, sensory appearance. As de Man asserts, however, Kant's materiality is neither literal nor figural, precisely because of its supreme uninvolvement with either transference or ex- change, especially as part of the key economic circulation between mind and nature. De Man makes this clear by contrasting the third Critique with recordings of the sublime in Wordsworth, where "exchange and anthropomorphism" allow the poet "to address, in Book 5 of The Prelude, the 'speaking face' of nature"' [82]. Wordsworth's ability to address nature adds another register to the materiality that de Man discovers in Kant. This dimension also comments on the argument about nature tentatively begun in "Against Theory" and categorically developed in The Shape. (As my concluding section suggests, this is also implicitly an argument about Wordsworth.) The story also has another key coordinate, Knapp and Michaels's decisive moment in their dispute with de Man in "Against Theory," where they argue that Rousseau's mouthing of "Marion" in Allegories of Reading is not an instance of unmotivated, meaningless language, but meaningless "white noise" that simply resembles language. "Marion" in "Against Theory" has nothing to do with language; it's a moment of sensory static that is a precursor to the meaningless experience of sensual materiality that The Shape identi- fies as the defining problem of de Manian aesthetics subtending posthistoricist politics. In terms of the argument of "Against Theory," the white noise of "Marion" means that de Man is wrong to use Rousseau's mouthing to assert the coincidence between language and meaninglessness, as "Marion" has literally nothing to say about language. "Against Theory" itself has nothing extended to say, however, about the status of the resemblance of "Marion" to language, of the resemblance of meaninglessness to mean- ing. Isn't resemblance itself a form of signification? Without posing the problem in quite those terms, The Shape answers this question by critiquing the role of nature in recent science fiction literature and the politics of deep ecology. Specifically, Michaels looks at several recent works of sci-fi that take up the question of what might it mean for the planet Mars to speak. This is first understood as the possibility of an indigenous people speak- ing for a place, where a planet (or nature) confers onto a people (or culture) an essential dignity and identity. But then, in Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars trilogy, a more radical proposition is explored, where the equation of nature and culture implies the possibility of an uninhabited planet speaking a language. In Robinson's works there are thus not only moments when settlers from Earth feel that their new planet allows them to speak culturally as Martians, but that the rocks of Mars - its very landscape - seem to speak. As in deep ecology, nature quite possibly is a culture with its own language, independent of any human coordinate. For Michaels, of course, the key detail is that Robinson's uninhabited Martian land- scape only appears to convey meaning. Mars seems to speak because of the "natural accident" of the shape of its rocks, which from different vantage points (or subject posi- tions) look like they might be something one could understand, a language [57]. Mars is 14</page><page sequence="14">the shape of the signifier, a physical materiality whose resemblance to meaning is only the effect of different perspectives, and whose replacement of meaning by meaninglessness incites the posthistoricist trumping of sensory experience over understanding. Mars, or uninhabited nature, is the endpoint of deep ecology: the posthistorical text and culture, the place of difference over disagreement and sensory effects over meaning. This is the predicament that Michaels refers to when he argues that the current posthistoricist pri- macy of the subject position "is based on a characteristically unacknowledged appeal to nature" [15]. To drive home the point, Michaels reworks another key moment in "Against The- ory," the wave poem, the example of coming across what appears to be Wordsworth's "A Slumber Did My Spirit Seal" in the sand. In The Shape what resembles the lines of Wordsworth's poem are now in Martian sand, or a formation of Martian rock. In "Against Theory" the discovery of the apparent lines forces us to choose between understanding them as lines, as writing "entirely determined by their author" [57], or seeing them as marks of nonlanguage that only accidentally resemble meaning. Transposing them to the dead Martian landscape, Michaels foregrounds the impossibility of seeing such squiggles as language, something that occurs only by mistaking the shape of such marks as lan- guage, when, in fact, shape's sole presence evinces the absence of language. On Mars, the sense of that impossibility is so great that you don't need to see anything but what resembles the first stanza of Wordsworth's poem to know that no one wrote it. In contrast, "On Earth ... you might immediately think that someone had been before you writing" [The Shape 57]. Indeed, as Knapp and Michaels "suggested" in "Against Theory," "it was only when, seeing these shapes on a beach [on Earth], you then saw a wave wash up and recede, leaving behind [what appeared to be the second stanza of "A Slumber] ... that you realized no person made these marks" [The Shape 57]. The retrospective nature of this realization actually creates a dissonance between Knapp and Michaels's argument and the one in The Shape, however. For, as with the change in Michaels's own understanding of "Against Theory" before and after his writ- ing of Our America, this realization depends on the temporal change of one's subject position, now, in the second stage of the wave example, a position oriented around the strange viewing of what appears to be the second stanza of Wordsworth's poem, instead of around the more prosaic discovery of the first. Retrospective meaning is always in some irreducible way a matter of temporal perspective, which is simply another version of the interdependence between meaning and spatial perspective that The Shape attacks. The retroactive structure of Knapp and Michaels's wave poem, the example's ongoing reaction to changing empirical evidence, allegorizes this very situation, the unavoidable relation between meaning and positioning, temporal or otherwise. The question of temporal location is also present in how the 1982 essay is understood through the vantage point of Michaels's 2004 book. In the Earth of "Against Theory," you might actually not immediately think someone had written the alleged first stanza-that's the problem, your belief in an intentionless language. If, however, by the second stage of the wave poem you no longer believe in intentionless language, that's a separate issue from believing in a specifically human "someone" responsible for the intentional mean- ing that putatively separates the writing of Wordsworth's second stanza from accidental squiggles. The Shape uses "Against Theory" to force the choice between an assumed human author and no human author (and thus no meaning) at all. But the question of human authorship is actually neither simply assumed, nor fully resolved, in Knapp and Michaels's earlier, more complicated argument against intentionless language. The Shape thus neglects to mention the starkly absurd but also unavoidable character of the wave poem's second-stage choice, as at that point in the example our only options for the marks' genesis are Wordsworth's ghost or a pantheistic sea somehow capable of diacritics / summer 2005 15</page><page sequence="15">authoring a poem; or the cosmic accident of squiggles resembling a poem being produced by the unintentional roiling of ocean wave and sandy beach. The Shape also leaves out the third stage of the wave poem example, the appearance of a submarine full of scien- tists watching our reactions to the squiggles, whose presence gives us (presumably, to our great relief) the empirical option of human intention. The coercive nature of such a pedagogical structure aside (given the choices, who would not accept the ontological authority of Michaels's technocrats?), the deletion of the third stage is telling, as its ab- sence highlights the scandalous, imperative nature of the second stage's demand: choose between intention or nothing, even if intention is disconnected from human agency. Choosing intention, of course, could just as well be about not choosing the cosmic accident of wave and ocean that merely produces resemblance. The whole point of the Mars example, that we should choose nothing when faced with an uninhabited landscape, becomes much more difficult to assent to when the example becomes a wave first rolling up and then revealing what appears to be the second stanza of "A Slumber" in the sand. As Knapp and Michaels describe, choosing nothing, the mere resemblance of the marks to words, means choosing "some subtle and unprecedented process of erosion, percolation, etc." [16; my emphasis]. Choosing this process means agreeing not only to what Knapp and Michaels call the "mechanical operation" of the waves, but to the mechanical as the genesis of an unprecedented singularity, an "astonishing coincidence" that transforms our sense of what contingency actually is [16]. The radical nature of such a contingency can only be conceived through its nonidentity as well, as a contingency that is also at once a process or pattern with some as yet understood purpose or design. Contrary to Knapp and Michaels, we are not "amazed" because something we thought was language turns out merely to resemble language. We are amazed because resemblance has happened at all, and cannot help but feel the uncanny intention of that accident. The extreme nature of their example points us in a direction altogether different from their normative definitions of intention, meaning, and language. Intention is not rationed to one side of the second stage's choice but distributed on both sides of the decision, though in such an unthinkable way that intention itself be- comes transformed. Faced with the cosmic accident of the wave, of, indeed, resemblance, we are faced with an intentionality more like what de Man in the terminology of an early essay calls the "structure" that establishes the unity of a work; our very distance from that unity or design, however, places us in what de Man describes as a Heideggerian "herme- neutic circularity," where the presence of such an intention can only be felt in terms of a "negative totalization" with which we can never quite coincide [Blindness 25, 29, 35]."7 Knapp and Michaels's wave poem experiment leads to this same unsteady situation of contingency knotted with the form of design. The point of both "Against Theory" and The Shape, of course, is to cut that knot, to separate accident from intentional form, or to force the choice between such form and form as the accidental resemblance of shape. But the book's own understanding of the essay freezes the latter around the impossible choice of what to think about the wave's unveiling of the apparent second stanza. De Man's early Heideggerian use of temporality as the aporetic element inciting endless hermeneutic circularity finds its counterpart in the temporal staging of the wave's activity, a staging that makes the question of intention scandalously unthinkable in terms of its unavoidable necessity, especially when compared to our relatively easy dismissal of intention when 17. Michaels also looks at the essay "Form and Intent in the American New Criticism, "focus- ing on how de Man sees the text in New Criticism as a sensory natural object-a stone-as opposed to an intentional object-a chair [106]. There does seem to be continuity between the nonteleologi- cal status of the stone and that of Kant's ocean. But, in using this as proof of de Man's early invest- ment in a physical materiality, Michaels ignores both de Man's critique of this sensory object in New Criticism and the essay's reworking of the notion of intention in Heideggerian terms. 16</page><page sequence="16">facing the static, uninhabited rock formations of Mars.'" The very activity of the waves, their mechanical operation, incites, keeps alive, the question of intention. The waves are a figure for some animating agency, or more exactly, a figure for an awareness of that figure. They are a figure for a temporal action, and therefore of tem- porality itself. But temporality is also a figure for a basic problem about meaning that de Man elaborates in his other early essay, the seminal "Rhetoric of Temporality" [Blindness 187-228]. Likewise, all the phenomenal and spatial language that de Man and Derrida at times employ, the "sound" of "Marion" or "surface" of the mark, are themselves figures for, different avenues into, the problem of language that deconstruction has explicitly tried to think through over the last forty years. Michaels, however, takes such language literally as evidence of an argument for an immanent physicality, so much so that the object of his critique he is left with is the literally impossible belief that texts, bodies, and cultures operate as objects purely experienced in a sensual manner. This invisible domestication of the figural reaches its apotheosis in his critique of recent sci-fi and other types of literature that envision language as a code, information, or somatic transmission, a pure communication of sensation that dispenses with language as mediated meaning. Michaels asserts this pure sensation as the posthistoricist endpoint of the physical tropes in deconstruction, without considering how such idealized physical sensation is simply another version of the self-present autarky of consciousness freed from the materiality of writing that the early Derrida interrogated so scrupulously in works like Of Grammatol- ogy and "Plato's Pharmacy." That moments of idealized physical transmission would still leave a material remainder, now not figured as the physical character of language exiled by consciousness, and that that would be the mark of a deconstructive inquiry, is not a possibility in The Shape. To say explicitly but also simply that invocations of the physi- cal are not always literal is to change profoundly what Michaels reads, and targets, in his text. Resemblances of nonmeaning to meaning, on Mars, Earth, and anywhere else in the uni- verse, are sensations of meaning that are neither the pure meaninglessness of sensory experience nor the pure meaning of a language. Such sensation, neither simply nor even necessarily phenomenal, registers the yoking of meaning and meaninglessness, in a way that paradoxically extends the complications of a meaningless language that The Shape wants to dismiss, as the sensation of meaning also remakes such language as the site of intention, the second unthinkable stage of the wave poem. Sensation is the figure for the possibility of such a meaningless, intentional language, where that possibility is the very sensation of such language. This is the sensation of sensation, the figure of figure, which resemblance intones. For Michaels, this is precisely the epistemological mistake that his argument against a physical sensation separate from meaning is supposed to dismiss. Conversely, however, the sensation of meaning is that dimension of figure that disarticu- lates figure's generation from the absolute confines of Michaels's human author. Such a separation opens up figure to the predicament of an incaculable generation, which is why so many scenes in Robinson's trilogy (and the wave poem's choice, in its own parodic way) seem to touch upon the sublime-as well as the gothic, in terms of the possible 18. One might wonder if it is that easy, or whether the wave's action highlights what is equally unintelligible on Mars, the discovery of what looks like the entire first stanza of "A Slumber" on the planet's sand or rock face. diacritics / summer 2005 17</page><page sequence="17">choice of the return of Wordsworth's ghost as author. The hyperbole of Michaels's wave example is therefore exemplary as hyperbole, the excess of figure. For Michaels, resemblance as the sensation of meaning is precisely the erroneous triumph of physical shapes and the experiential perspective of the subject position. Re- semblance is a subjective effect, depending on one's position in relation to the perceived object. For Michaels, though, meaning never changes, no matter from what perspective meaning is viewed. Hence, Michaels uses the artist Robert Smithson to assert the idea of a map as a model for both texts and paintings, since a map's (authored) meaning doesn't depend on your subjective relation to it; it just is.19 We might wonder, however, if mis- reading and then arguing over a map isn't also a matter of perspective -who hasn't tried to bring a map closer to their face when lost? And if we are mistaken, disagreeing over the map's meaning when we're actually just viewing it differently, how much might that epistemological lapse actually subtend the arguments (as opposed to differences) we have over texts? And what is the status of being lost, when reading a text? How much does such a model, or figure, of map-as-text simply operate as a resemblance?20 More fundamentally, there is the question of whether resemblance even functions within the differential calculus of the objective meaning of an authored work and the identifiable view of an opposing subject position. The point of the resemblance of non- meaning to meaning is that it is in fact impossible to determine whether such resem- blance rests within the empirical object or the phenomenally perceiving subject. We don't know if it is there or if we're imagining it to be; it is a relation radically dislocated from the constative underpinnings of each option. Resemblance is figure genetically unbound from the categories of human reader, viewer, and author, which is one way to understand de Man's observation about the "inhuman" nature of language [Resistance 86, 94-97, 99-102]. This scission is itself simply another way of expressing the figurative nature of both object and subject, as well as that of the spatial and temporal distance between them; the impossibility of locating resemblance absolutely in either is itself a trope for a specific condition in language and figure. That condition not only includes the separation of resemblance from a human agency who is either the recipient of subjective experience or the author of objective meaning. That condition is also the simultaneous sensation of meaning or intention, the phantom pattern of "negative totalization." The resemblance of nonmeaning to meaning might actually be meaningful, and, scandalously enough, au- thored. The (literary) affects associated with this sensation of the uncanny, sublime, and gothic are therefore in continuity with a more accurate correlation of de Man's inhuman 19. "That is the difference in Smithson's terms, between the view of a quarry and the ('great artist's') 'glance' that turns the quarry into a map. Where the view is entirely dependent on where the viewer is--the view is a relation between the viewer and what he or she sees; the view is how things look to a certain person from a certain position-the text or map is its opposite. Two people in two different positions will see two different views; two readers in two different positions will read the same text" [104]. But Jameson's own postmodern use of "cognitive mapping" might make us ask what the nonstatus of perspective is when we are viewing a map of our own subject position [Postmodernism 51-54]. The meaning of a map does change according to our location, if it is a map of that location. 20. One might observe the same about the very relation between maps and nonmaps, or texts and objects: that discerning something as a map and not something that simply looks like a map depends on your particular perspective, on getting close or far away enough to see which it is. Con- versely, to discern the resemblance between a noise and the name "Marion," we orient ourselves around the very meaning of that name. In one instance, meaning depends on perspective, while, in the other, resemblance depends on the very perspective of meaning. Michaels might counter that once you've decided a map is a map it stays a map, no matter where you position yourself. But if you leave and return, deciding whether what you see is that map or something that resembles it again depends on your perspective. 18</page><page sequence="18">language and deep ecology, with the simultaneous evacuation of human meaning and instantiation of resemblance to meaning in the natural object.21 Michaels anticipates the problematic of this more vertiginous generation of significa- tion by distingishing between meaning and effect, the latter already present in "Against Theory" as the choice of seeing the squiggles in the sand as simply the "nonintentional effects of mechanical processes" [16]. In The Shape effects are further aligned with the physical materiality of sensation and nonmeaning.22 Properly speaking, meaning is always intentionally caused, while effects are not. Since for Michaels meaning is always equated with intention, meaning will always be confined to intention, and found nowhere else. But, as much as both "Against Theory" and The Shape assert the fundamental wrongness of finding meaning in resemblance, the acknowledgment of effect sets off a dynamic that Michaels's distinction between meaning and effect can't quite control. Thus, in arguing with Derrida's substitution of "intentional effect for intention," Michaels opines, We don't in general identify the meaning of an act with the effects it has; we don't think that the act performed by the assassin of Archduke Ferdinand at Sarajevo was the act of starting World War I, even though we may believe that World War I was indeed a consequence of this act. And we certainly don't identify the mean- ings of texts and speech acts with their effects. We don't treat the fact that it bores or amuses you as part of the meaning of my utterance; we don't treat the fact that it makes you think of one thing instead of another thing as part of its meaning; we don't even think the fact that it makes you think what I want you to think (that it communicates what I mean) or that it doesn't is part of its meaning. [127] Effects are caused by the tyranny of the experiential subject: our ability to feel amuse- ment and boredom, or to have thoughts we associate with a text, even a thought that correctly reproduces the meaning of the author. Indeed, a "reader's understanding of the text" is an effect of the text, but separate from the "meaning of the text," even if they coincide [128]. Resemblances would certainly be an effect, but, as the epistemological escalation of the passage indicates, so might almost everything else that passes for prac- tical knowledge, or practical interest, in literary studies. Effects don't even seem to be confined to the subject, if we are asked to consider the difference between an act starting World War I and World War I being merely an unintentional consequence of an act. (What intentional act did start World War I, then?) Such a distinction seems less about what we might individually think and more about a debate over historical causality. Conversely, if this really is about only us, the subjective effects of texts or utterances we experience, it is difficult to see how posthistory will end, and we can begin once again to argue over the meaning of texts, if our separate understandings of a text are still just effects of the text. Michaels's determination to separate meaning from the sensation of meaning basically turns everything into sensation, into a series of Derrida's intentional effects. In that sense, 21. This correlation would be more apt than the one that conflates de Man's materiality with the physical world presented in David Abram's deep ecology argument The Spell of the Sensu- ous. When Michaels thus claims that the argument for no meaning is the same as one for many meanings, he is correct, though not because of the joining of idealist skepticism and relativism. The evacuation of human meaning, what anchors calculation, is simultaneously a generation of resemblances that is incalculable. 22. The effects of such materiality are also associated with the performative nature of Derri- da's mark, another extension of the argument about de Manian materiality made by The Shape. For Warminski, the materiality of Rousseau's mouthing of "Marion" is more exactly the catachrestic discontinuity between the performative and cognitive aspects of language, rather than simply the performance of meaninglessness [Material Events 25-27]. diacritics / summer 2005 19</page><page sequence="19">everything becomes a resemblance. This overrunning of effect, or resemblance, into the world would then itself simply be a trope for the sensation of meaning as not being about either the subject or object in any aboriginally prelinguistic way. In order to keep meaning distinct from effect, and the text separate from every- thing else, Michaels cedes everything to effect. This might seem less an askesis than simply, and somewhat ironically, the end of argument, as most might feel inclined to give Michaels his meaning and then go study everything else, the effects of the world. But, from Michaels's standpoint, a text isn't everything, an argument he associates with Michael Fried's modernist appeal for the need to frame artwork.23 (Hence the full title of Michaels's book, 1967 being when Fried published his influential essay "Art and Object- hood," about postmodernism and art.) To disarticulate artwork and texts from framing is to open them up to the vertiginous generation of effects, and thereby end their status as artwork or text. Alluding to a story about artist Tony Smith's nighttime highway drive, Michaels comments, "As a producer of effects, the text is like the unfinished New Jersey Turnpike and like everything else in the world: you can't put a frame around it" [127].24 Without a frame, you have neither text nor the text's meaning--just everything else. Earlier, Michaels makes it clear that this is once again the problem of fetishizing physical materiality. Concerned with a frame as the "sensuous appearance of a text," we don't simply read the text. Indeed, trying to do so suddenly seems, is, arbitrary, as contingent as frames really are: "Conventions are arbitrary; if it is only conventions that keep us from taking the surface of the paper ... into what Derrida calls 'our calculations' then every frame we place around the text, every limit impose on it, will seem just that, an imposition-something that may be necessary but that cannot be justified" [112-13]. And once we have dismissed frames for the contingent conventions that they are, or made them part of what we are experiencing, the text or artwork becomes part of everything else, simply another object whose variety of perception by different subjects is identical with the multiplicity of experience, instead of the univocality of interpretation. The whole point of The Shape, is, of course, that we shouldn't make this mistake. But it's unclear from Michaels's argument how preserving frames that separate texts from the world might change the contingent nature of such entities. As Michaels himself seems to indicate, Fried's entreaty for the "innumerable conventions of both art and of practi- cal life" is not an argument against perceiving the convention of the frame as something arbitrary [112]. Framing a work might avoid the dire consequences of an out-of-control subject position that Michaels outlines; it might also be the outcome of shunning the sen- 23. Michaels's argument should not be confused with attempts to protect textual literariness from the encroachment of cultural studies. See, for example, Rajan, "In the Wake." For a cogent critique of the concept of culture in Our America from the position of cultural studies, see Glass. 24. Framing is specifically opposed to the nonframing implication of the Derridean mark as formulated in Limited Inc [112]. Michaels thus not does engage with Derrida's own discussion of artistic framing in The Truth of Painting, especially Derrida's association of the frame with the logic of the supplement [193-200]. Indeed the question of the supplement does not inform any of Michaels's critique-including his association of "I n 'y a pas de hors texte" with deep ecology's claim that the world speaks. The absence is notable, given how Michaels's own desire to separate meaning from sensation depends on an intelligible distinction between inside and outside, as well as not seeing separation for what it is: a figure. In associating Derrida with the end offrames, Mi- chaels also conflates deconstruction with the pragmatic relativist argument that contexts determine meaning. See however, Jan Mieszkowski's argument with Stanley Fish over this very point [2-4]. Finally, there is the question of what is occurring when Michaels makes Fried's essay about art and framing the intention of the iconic 1967, a term that, by generating a host of historical semantic effects, enacts the very dynamic that Michaels's frames are supposed to resist. If this is Michaels's intention, it is also the intention of the supplement. 20</page><page sequence="20">suous appearance of a text in the first place; but it is also just that, an "imposition ... that may be necessary but that cannot be justified" [112].25 In Michaels's terms, moreover, frames ensure the status of a text or artwork as a "rep- resentation," insofar as the piece as modern art is distinct from everything around it [112]. Representation is another way to talk about figure, though here in The Shape such figure operates in an intensely stable, functionalist manner. Figure as representation conveys the one meaning or intention of the author of the work. Indeed, one could in fact understand figure in Michaels as explicitly about representation, not resemblance. Yet what about that same figure, or representation, understood as an imposition? The contingent charac- ter of framing, not quite extinguished in Michaels's argument, brings representation and resemblance into each other's gravitational pull. Likewise, the distance between intention and imposition collapses. Indeed, Michaels's discussion of framing inadvertently pro- vides us with a perhaps more advantageous candidate for de Manian materiality, rather than Michaels's incorrect use of the term as the physical property of language. Materiality is in fact the very imposition of figure, an action whose radical arbitrariness blunts the realization of figural representation as simple, intentional meaning. But figure, as the very site of transference and exchange, retroactively confers onto materiality the sensation of meaning, or the resemblance of an intention. Such temporal language would itself be an allegory for a condition of language that spatial images, especially of the sublime, also try to evoke. Kant's ocean would then coincide with Knapp's and Michaels's sea, now, however, roiling and inciting (or unveiling) figure, the imposed meaning of nonmeaning's resemblance to meaning. Such a predicament is indeed often narrativized as an appeal to nature, explicit or other- wise, as Michaels notes. But if nature in all its nonhuman sensation is a placeholder for what can be, as de Man notes with Wordsworth, "addressed" in this situation, history can also occupy that position, as Marx's famous dictum in The Eighteenth Brumaire reminds us.26 And the appeal to silent history is not as easily dismissed as a nonhuman Martian landscape that does not speak-though, as Robinson's trilogy makes clear, understanding what Mars has to say is very much related to discerning the momentum of a planetary history encompassing both Earth and Mars.27 For Michaels such a desire again incites a choice, between knowing history as history and experiencing it as memory. Indeed, the problem of posthistorical historicism in his book is not the absence of historical con- sciousness, as it is in Jameson, but the transformation of history into lived memory, a presentist lapse once again informed by the hegemony of the subject position. Such a 25. This moment exemplifies a tension in the book between the instrumental and the constative, where arguing whether something is true or false seems to be the same as arguing whether some- thing is good or bad. In contrast, see Laclau and Mouffe's assertion that the fact of subordination by itself is not the same as social antagonism [Hegemony 154]. 26. "Men make their own history, but they do not make it just as they please; they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves, but under circumstances directly found, given and transmitted from the past" [595]. See also note 31. 27. Indeed the aphasic scientist that Michaels cites in Robinson's trilogy, who sees "shapes without the names" [Green 349], is also the character most associated with the study of history [Green 189-92, Blue 481-84]. He is also not the deep ecologist; that is another character with whom he spends much of the three books intensely debating. The appeal to a nonhuman Mars is thus part of a much larger practice of political argument that characterizes the Martian culture of the books. The theme of history in the trilogy, as well as Jameson's influence on Robinson, has been widely noted. See Abbott and Markley. diacritics / summer 2005 21</page><page sequence="21">miscue characterizes not only the argument for reparations for slavery and other issues about ethnic and racial identity, but also academic discourse as well, including both New Historicist studies and deconstruction's own engagements with history.28 The figure of history as experienced memory is the ghost, present in such diverse works as Toni Morrison's Beloved and the New Historicist technology that critically en- ables that very experience. Michaels argues the ghost is not actually needed in decon- struction, as it is merely a figure for what deconstruction actually does, the deracination of the historical sign into the performative mark, a physicality denuded of meaning and thus open to the experiential, subjective politics of difference. Thus, while a critique of presentisim certainly does inform the complex politics of historicism, Michaels's own version relies once again on a limited understanding of deconstruction as an argument for the phenomenal, as well as a strict separation between the physically immaterial (the ghost) and material (the sensory object as mark). He thus also separates the figural and literal - deconstruction literally does what the ghosts of New Historicism only figura- tively do. Yet the sensation of meaning indicates a more phantasmic state than the regu- lated nature of this separation allows, a linguistic operation that focuses on the relation between the physical and nonphysical, the literal and figural, as figure. Complicating Michaels's adumbration of posthistory, then, the ghost is not always simply a figure for historical memory; more difficultly, history can also be the ghostly, phantasmic operation of figure.29 This latter formulation, with all its implications, is the concern of a number of de- constructive writings, though it is certainly not relegated to such works per se.30 We can in fact apply this formula to the very historical knowledge that Michaels claims has been abandoned in favor of historical memory, and that presumably informs his own book. We have already discussed the effects generated by the resemblance of his text to a more explicitly Marxist analysis, and how his own retroactive understanding of his 1982 es- say seems based on resemblances left in the wake of a twenty-year gap or difference in temporal position. Knowledge of any author, necessarily past, brings intention and figure together; we do choose Wordsworth's ghost all the time, as Knapp and Michaels say we must. But we also choose the intention of history-as-nature, since to say that history is an operation of figure is to say that its design is made up of resemblances. The shape of The Shape, its own historical knowledge, is based on the resemblance between its "theo- retical" and "historical" arguments, the prehistorical structures of sensory nonintention 28. Undergirding Michaels's claims, especially visible in his argument against slave repara- tions, is the provocative assertion that politics and historicism should be separated. The question then becomes whether Michaels actually wants to turn all social issues into ones of ethics, and how much the later Derrida's writings on ethics and justice could have had an impact on such aformu- lation. See, for example, Derrida's discussion of the tension between past precedence and present justice in "Force of Law" 3-29. 29. Thus in his reading of Shoshana Felman's argument about testimony and de Man's war- time journalism, Michaels seizes upon the word "like" in her statement that reference as a form of absence returns "like a ghost," asserting that, as such, the deconstructive object of nonmeaning is not, and does not need, the New Historicist ghost, which in the former functions as a supereroga- tory figure ("like"). A contrasting reading would focus on "like" as the very operation offigure-as- ghost, the spectral mise en abyme of reference; ghosts are not simply on one side of reference but the act of reference. Also, whether all New Historicists would recognize themselves in the simplified model of experiential memory that Michaels extrapolates from Stephen Greenblatt is, of course, open to debate. 30. Derrida's Specters of Marx, with its own complex rendering of the performative injunction from Hamlet, immediately comes to mind as one study that would have complicated Michaels's summary. Redfield's Phantom Formations would be another example of a work whose ghostly lan- guage does not assume a resolute divide between the figural and the literal. 22</page><page sequence="22">espoused by de Man and others, and the posthistorical ideological triumph of capitalism. The design of the book, its intention, is in fact a clever tripartite structure (aside from its coda on Hardt and Negri), founded on the resemblances among history, prehistory, and historicism. This is not to say that the design isn't true (though I have been saying that about a number of its claims) but to point out that its own constative status rests on a re- lational structure to which Michaels's descriptive term of "historical knowledge" seems inadequate. But neither does Michaels's definition of memory as experience describe the history of The Shape. Walking upon a beach and coming upon posthistory, Michaels neither knows nor experiences the historical; he does read its intention, however, in the form of its sensation. She had fallen in love with Mars for the same reason that Michel hated it: be- cause it was dead. -Kim Stanley Robinson, Red Mars If The Shape is an argument over what form politics and historical understanding should take, it's also a fight over what literature is, and should be. More precisely, it's an argu- ment about an epistemological lapse that literature consistently repeats, of finding mean- ing in nonmeaning; of being obsessed by the gothic and uncanny structures of semantic generation. In that sense, literature would be the placeholder for precisely what in the design of The Shape exceeds the book's own self-representation as historical knowledge, what one might perversely admire as the book's formal organization. Examples of this coincidence between literature and its own ostensibly worse instincts are both prosaic and profound, and abound in both our scholarship and classrooms.31 The historical nar- rativization of this coincidence has its own name, of course, which is romanticism. There are many versions of this rdcit, in the form of both opprobrium and identification, both within but also beyond the era of romantic writing itself, that make up literary history - that arguably make up the very object of that history. Michaels's own work can thus be approached not simply through a comparison to Jameson's Postmodernism, but also as 31. Within another context and along another coordinate, Michaels is much more nuanced about this capitulation: "The ascription of interests, to a money economy (or, for that matter, to a disciplinary society) is only a figure of speech or a mistake, personification or pathetic fallacy. At the same time, however, as literary critics-and as critics of [American] naturalism-we can hardly dismiss this mistake, this particular figure, as merely one among others. For according to the logic of naturalism it is only because we are fascinated by such mistakes -by natural objects that look as if they were made by humans-that we have any economy at all" [Gold 179]. In this account, the personification of nature and of the bourgeois economy as well ultimately provide the grounds for distinguishing between what persons are and are not; yet such an end is also entangled with the constant "mistake "of personification, a fascination that appears more pervasive and im- portant for human society than the distinction itself as it is purified in Michaels's reading of his Mars example. In this passage Gold outlines a predicament for study while The Shape describes a mistake that must be corrected. Indeed, the Foucauldian-inspired description of the economy in Gold resembles the problem of history that this essay adumbrates: "the desire to personify the economy is the desire to bridge the gap between our actions by imagining a person who does not do what we do but who does what what we do does. As it is, there is no such person" [179]. The question is whether the "desire to personify" resides in "no such person" as well. That Wimsatt and Beardsley's complement to the pathetic fallacy is the romantic mistake of the intentionalfallacy also explains why the polemic in "Against Theory" and The Shape is also an argument against romanticism. diacritics / summer 2005 23</page><page sequence="23">the latest example of a modernist appeal to repudiate the hold that the cognitive lapse of romanticism has over literature, art, and politics. The narcissistic solipsism of romanti- cism targeted by Irving Babbitt finds its corollary in the subject position of posthistory critiqued in The Shape. Michaels himself alludes to the romantic underpinnings of fetishizing the subject's senses when referring to the German romantic character of Richard Rorty's emphasis on feeling and "speaking differently," approaches that together will mistakenly trans- form written text into sensory object [75-76]. The empirical crisis that Michaels thus describes finds its psychological and epistemological parameters already anticipated by romanticism's own inquiries into the relation between subject and phenomenal world. But romanticism also contains a larger, more complex description of this problem, through, among other trajectories, the one that de Man mentions between Kant's ocean and Wordsworth's address to nature, the latter a troping, or imposition, of the transference of mind and nature and therefore of an economy of figurative exchange. Critical readings of the volatility of that economy are different registerings of the sensation of meaning that Wordsworth poeticizes in his work, an activity in his writing that explicitly includes the (non)resemblances within and between nature and history, as a romanticist genera- tion of historicist scholarship from the 1980s has exploited, for and beyond studies of the particular poet. As the subject of both wave and Martian poem indicate, as the section headings for Michaels's argument against posthistory's covert "appeal to nature" cleverly demonstrate ("rocks," "and stones," "and trees"), "Against Theory" and The Shape are themselves allegories for one way to read romanticism-as-Wordsworth.32 This is literally the case in terms of the canonical status of "A Slumber" as the poem that numerous critics use throughout the last century to argue over what an interpretation of a poem might actually mean--something Knapp and Michaels acknowledge. But it is also the case because of the subject matter of "A Slumber," one of many versions in Wordsworth of a poet facing the resemblance of nonmeaning to meaning, of impossibly contemplating design in what Michaels dismisses. Indeed, much of Wordsworth's writ- ings seem to anticipate such a dismissal, with versions of the poet both acknowledging and defying the emptying out of meaning in numerous scenes. The boy of Winander's fa- mous "gentle shock of mild surprise" would denote one such moment, at once Michaels's bad faith, pantheistic "appeal," and de Man's more difficult "address" to nature. "A Slumber" narrates a similar moment by having its poet meditate upon Lucy's dead body, an utter stillness caught in the diurnal, gravitational motion of the universe. The reading of nature becomes a waiting before death, with stillness and motion tropes for the very figuration of space and temporality that makes that transformation legible. Temporality is a quality of the poem famously explored by de Man and others, as well as something that leads Knapp and Michaels's own wave poem version toward an ani- mate oceanic agency that makes their second stage choice an example of the unavoidable coincidence of hyperbole and intention in language. Knotted together with space in the poem, temporality is also inevitably about the very (non)resemblance between those co- ordinates, their own figurative generation and, consequently, that of the world's, insofar as you cannot have the world without time and space. In that sense, "A Slumber" does indeed evince itself as the prehistory, or protohistory, of figure that enables the trans- formation of time's duration and space's movement into history. "A Slumber" evinces 32. See Jackson [100-17] for her complementary argument about the wave poem as an a priori hypostatization of the lyric poem, as well as for her provocative reading of de Man's own lyricization of theory. If for Jackson the wave poem is about the reading of literature as the lyric, for me the wave poem is about the reading of literature as romanticism-two formulations that are by no means mutually exclusive. 24</page><page sequence="24">........ ....'s....

Maurice Benayoun installation, e-Market_stock</page><page sequence="25">the unreadability of prehistory as nature, death, and history, and thus as the sensation of meaning of those terms. Michaels would, of course, dismiss such a formulation as the very mistake of linking meaning to nonmeaning. Indeed, "A Slumber" could instead dramatize that confusion in exactly the terms The Shape uses: a poet mistakes a dead body for a text to be understood, when in fact he is simply subjectively experiencing an object, confusing his position toward her as poetic meaning. Yet, in "A Slumber," the spatial relation between poet and Lucy is radically indeterminate: A slumber did my spirit seal: I had no human fears. She seemed a thing that could not feel The touch of earthly years. No motion has she now, no force; She neither hears nor sees; Rolled round in earth's diurnal course, With rocks, and stones, and trees. Where the poem's action takes place--at Lucy's grave, in the poet's mind, in the earth, or in the universe-is one of the questions asked of the piece. Similarly, when the poem occurs is also unclear. The divide between the two stanzas creates a sense of spatial and temporal change that can be immediately complicated by asking whether Lucy is already in the ground at the start of the poem. Neither the poet's physical nor temporal location is fixed in the piece. He is literally disembodied, apparently bereft of any particular subject position aside from his relation to Lucy, someone who has become, as de Man notes, a thing. When she became such an object, whether the speaker's perception of her or her death made her so, is also a ques- tion - one so conventional it defines in many ways the history of reading and teaching the poem. But the question also defines the very instability of subjective feeling and objec- tive world that makes the sensation of meaning something else besides the despotism of the subject position. The objective status of Lucy as an object and the speaker's interior relation to this external predicament are also both predicated on the same action, or more exactly appearance of an action: "She seemed a thing that could not feel / The touch of earthly years" [lines 3-4; my emphasis]. The speaker's relation to Lucy does not create a perception. Rather, that relation is evidenced by a resemblance, the sensation of Lucy as a thing. He felt a certain way because of what she seemed to be. Similarly, the status of Lucy as a thing, as an object, is based on the resemblance of a thing to a thing--of death to sleep, or of death to life. Dead, she seems to become something akin to what she seemed to be in life. Both subject position and object are based on an appeal to figure, what both shapes and blocks our (one) understanding of the poem's action. The sensation of Lucy is thus not at all necessarily phenomenal, with feeling itself reached either through figure ("the touch of earthly years") or feeling's negation: the speaker feels Lucy rolling round with the earth, which is him simultaneously feeling her neither seeing nor hearing anything. The combination of her utter stillness and intense movement at poem's end is thus also a figure for the aperceptual sensation of meaning that more properly describes the working of sense in the poem than any literally physical, sensory experience. Neither seeing nor hearing, Lucy has become an object like a rock, stone, or tree. But that does not mean she is either seen or heard, much less experienced purely as an immediate, physical presence. (The same could be said of the poem's own rocks, stones, and trees, metonymically realized by their proximity to Lucy.) Paradoxi- 26</page><page sequence="26">cally, she is like Michaels's map, intransigent in her location buried beneath the ground. Wherever we move, whatever we feel, she is simply there. But she is a moving map, as the ground itself rolls diurnally. She is meaning based on figure, and forever in relation to the positioning - the imposition - of her own movement. Meaning is a nonphenomenal sensation tied to figure and resemblance and therefore to the effects of nonmeaning. "A Slumber" allegorizes our (which is to say, language's) compulsive reading of this event, while The Shape and "Against Theory" narrate the sober, pragmatic end to such romantic madness. Michaels's book and coauthored essay are not the first. It is not much of a stretch to say that the literary (as well as political) his- tory of modernity is based on countless attempts either to constrain or do away with the cognitive and ethical lapses of a solipsistic romantic sensation. That Wordsworth himself famously asks us to be vigilant against the despotic eye simply shows how much romanti- cism itself helps formulate this problem in countless diverse versions, including up to this day equations that confuse a sensation of meaning not in debt to the subject with a physi- cal meaninglessness both enthralling, and enthralled by, the narcissism of subjectivity. To say this in another way: postmodernism has to be understood through romanticism because that is how modernism understands itself. Postmodernisms that understand them- selves simply as part of a binary with modernism (that would be Fried's and Michaels's, but also Jameson's) basically assume that modernism has superseded romanticism. But if modernism is against postmodernism, the latter is beside romanticism as well. Michaels's "theoretical" argument is already "historical," in that his argument about meaning is really about the history of literature as it is made intelligible by the (post)modernity of romanticism. This is by no means to downplay the seriousness of the subject matter in The Shape, neither the complexity nor the urgency of the issues it tries to address. This is certainly not to dismiss the question of intention for our present study of literature and culture, as intention's relation to history coheres into a larger problematic that we have not quite faced, both in terms of our teaching and the critical arguments that we make. And this is not to deny the risks involved in the political inscriptions of sensations of meaning, the immense difficulty of navigating between Babbitt's narcissistic romantic self and the interminable call of, say, Zi'ek's Big Other. But it is to say that political meaning--in, as Wordsworth himself shows, the interpersonal, the intelligibility of history, and the retro- active event of memory--is not simply meaning.33 It is the sensation of intention, belief, understanding, argument, and conflict as well. There is a politics to sensation that ineluc- tably informs the politics of meaning. If the sensation of meaning can now only congeal in the commodity object of late capital, the sensation of a contingent future still demands a revolutionary meaning beyond capital's reach. Likewise, whatever impasses identitar- ian politics may evince, there is no going back to a politics that does not acknowledge the sensation of identity and the uncanniness of the same; that does not make room (however riskily) for sensations of meaning as comprising a cynosure for political discussion and practice. There is no simple way to have subjects instead of ghosts, meaning instead of resemblance, knowledge instead of the uncanny. To try and do so is to indulge in an aestheticism--one based not on sensory experience but on the phenomenal cognition of truth. 33. Such a dynamic is, of course, not simply the same as Wordsworth's own politics, both pro- and post-Girondin. diacritics / summer 2005 27</page><page sequence="27">WORKS CITED Abbot, Carl.
