<plain_text><page sequence="1">Landscapes of Indifference: Robert Smithson and John Lloyd Stephens in Yucatfan Jennifer L. Roberts I actually value indifference. I think it's something that has aesthetic possibilities.-Robert Smithson, "What Is a Museum?" 19671 Robert Smithson and John Lloyd Stephens were both New Jersey-born residents of Manhattan, wherefrom each em- barked on a well-publicized excursion to the Yucatin Penin- sula. One left New York on Monday, October 9, 1841, aboard the cargo ship Tennessee, the other on Tuesday, April 15, 1969, aboard Pan Am flight 67.2 Both published narratives of their travels: Stephens's Incidents of Travel in Yucatan was a two- volume book published by Harper and Brothers in 1843, while Smithson's "Incidents of Mirror-Travel in the Yucatan" appeared as an article in the September 1969 issue of Artforum.3 Both narratives included illustrations (Figs. 1, 2). The immediate similarities end there. Stephens's ante- bellum adventure, steeped in nineteenth-century imperialist and positivist rhetoric, bears so little direct resemblance to Smithson's meandering, skeptical treatment that the two barely seem worth discussing in the same breath.4 Indeed, Smithson himself downplayed his connection to Stephens; although he knew Stephens's writings and suggested in his title a desire to reflect on them, he avoided any direct reference to Stephens in the body of his article. When he did speak explicitly of Stephens, it was only to negate him; in one interview he referred to his Yucatdin trip as an "anti- expedition" to Stephens's.5 Yet despite Smithson's apparent attempts to disavow Stephens and his nineteenth-century baggage, Smithson's Yucatin project can be fruitfully examined in terms of the dialogue it invites with the tradition of expedition narrative. This essay will argue that by forcing Smithson's Yucatdn expedition into this historical perspective, we find ourselves confronted with new questions about his entire body of landscape production. Although Smithson is best known today as a land or earthworks artist (his Spiral Jetty provides a standard illustra- tion of the movement for art history survey texts), his quintessential medium was arguably neither land nor earth but rather travel. Smithson spoke often of his desire to be "thrown out to the edges," and in nearly all of his most influential work-his Site/Nonsites (Fig. 8), his eccentric Artforum travelogues, his far-flung earthworks-he used the act of expedition to establish a trademark dialectic between center and periphery.6 In interpreting this complex expedi- tionary dialectic, scholars of Smithson's work have generally focused on its radical opposition to the high-modernist aesthetics prevailing in the 1960s. This approach, which interprets Smithson as a key figure in the transition from "modern" to "postmodern" models of art production, has shown how Smithson's traveling practice dislocated the tradi- tional sites of artistic production, complicated the authorial function, violated disciplinary boundaries, and obscured the distinctions between the visual and the verbal.7 These analyses have done an excellent and necessaryjob of accounting for-indeed, helping to determine-Smithson's status as one of the most influential artists of the late twentieth century. Yet in their emphasis on Smithson's proto- postmodernism they have been obliged to extract Smithson's travels from broader historical contexts, notably the long (and largely unsavory) Western expeditionary tradition. The postmodern analytical lens rightly sees Smithson's icono- clastic trip to Mexico as an attack on his immediate high- modernist critical forebears, such as Michael Fried and Clement Greenberg, but it fails to illuminate the simulta- neous dialogue that the project sets up with earlier precur- sors, such as Hernin Cortes and Stephens. Moreover, attuned as it must be to indeterminacies, this criticism cannot address the determinate role that late 1960s attitudes toward primitiv- ism, Central America, and the Maya played in Smithson's project. Thus, it cannot explain how Smithson's expedition might have been different had it occurred at another histori- cal moment or in some other tropical landscape, nor can it hold Smithson politically accountable for the image of the region that he constructs. By repositioning Smithson's project within the context of American travel narrative, my aim is not simply to provide Smithson with a tidy nineteenth-century pedigree. It is, rather, to reveal aspects of his work that complicate our sense of his postmodernity, to help initiate critical debate about the historical implications of his expeditionary methodology, and to suggest, despite Smithson's frequent renunciations of "anthropomorphism" and politics, that his expedition to the Yucatdn Peninsula constituted both an anthropology and a politics of peripheral encounter. I pursue this analysis by tracing the concept of indifference as each traveler applies it to the landscape and the inhabitants of the Yucatin Peninsula. Stephens's narrative, of course, puts "indifference" into play as a pejorative term; by constructing the people of Yucatdn as indifferent to their own history, Stephens authorizes his own extraction of archaeological artifacts from the region. Smithson subjects such imperialist operations to a blistering critical inversion, and much of this essay will be devoted to exploring that critique. But I also hope to show that in some of the most sophisticated aspects of Smithson's critique, particularly in his attempts to imagine a form of "dedifferentiated" vision and history, Stephens's notion of indigenous indifference is necessarily retained. Stephens and Catherwood: Vision and History as Differentiation During the 1830s and early 1840s, John Lloyd Stephens embarked on several major expeditions to regions beyond the fringes of Anglo-American influence. The exoticism of his</page><page sequence="2">ROBERT SMITHSON AND JOHN LLOYD STEPHENS IN YUCATAN 545 destinations (such as Turkey, Russia, Egypt, Arabia, Jerusa- lem, and Central America), combined with what one twentieth- century critic approvingly described as his "delightful style overflowing with anecdote and salacious adventure,"8 made Stephens one of the most successful American travel writers of the nineteenth century. His best-selling books found favor with the general public and influenced a generation of American writers, among them Edgar Allan Poe and Herman Melville.9 Stephens's meticulously detailed Central American travel narratives have remained important references; still in print, they are considered classic texts in Mesoamerican archaeology. Between 1839 and 1842, Stephens took two trips to the Yucatan Peninsula, each of which resulted in a two-volume illustrated expedition narrative published by Harper and Brothers in New York.'o Stephens was accompanied on both occasions by the British architect Frederick Catherwood, whose illustrations attended the published narratives and gave audiences in the United States their first glimpse of ancient Mesoamerica (Figs. 2-4, 14).11 In the late 1830s, most of the ruins of what are now known to be ancient Maya cities had been abandoned for centuries. Although there had been European accounts (mostly unreliable) published of a few of the sites in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, Stephens and Catherwood were the first explorers to under- take a systematic survey of the ruins, proving that a highly developed civilization had once flourished in the Western hemisphere.12 Within the United States, their discoveries inflamed vigorous debate about the origin of the mysterious ancient builders; about their connection, if any, with the region's current inhabitants; and about the position of the United States within the suddenly expanded scope of the New World's course of empire.'3 Stephens and Catherwood first encountered Maya ruins at Copan (then, as now, in Honduras), where the ancient structures and stelae stood tangled in a centuries-old jungle chokehold. This encounter came near the beginning of the expedition; having landed in Belize, the travelers began their explorations in the dense, mountainous rain forests of Cen- tral America, then gradually made their way to the drier, more thinly forested landscapes of the northern part of the YucatAn Peninsula. The effect of this itinerary on the published narrative is to suggest a correlation between the progress of the expedition and the unfolding of the landscape, and for the inaugural chapters of the travelogue, this means that the opening of vision, the founding of historical narrative, and the clearing of the landscape all participate in the same drama. Stephens's descriptions of the obstacles faced early on in Copin include the most basic challenges of visual and historical differentiation, dramatizing the landscape's resis- tance to the travelers' every attempt at scrutiny. At first, according to Stephens, Catherwood found it difficult even to produce a coherent drawing from the tangled scene around him. Inscribed with illegible hieroglyphs, which seemed to mimic the overgrown vegetation that covered them, the ruins proved challenging to discern, much less to comprehend: The designs were very complicated, and so different from anything Mr. Catherwood had ever seen before as to be perfectly unintelligible. The cutting was in very high relief, and required a strong body of light to bring up the figures; and the foliage was so thick, and the shade so deep, that drawing was impossible.14 Only after indigenous laborers had been employed to cut down the trees around each stela and "lay it open," and only after several failed attempts at drawing, was Catherwood finally able to separate the monuments from the foliage and, as Stephens had put it, to "bring up the figures" before him.'5 The resultant engravings, the first to be encountered in Stephens's book, reproduce for the (presumably Anglo- American) viewer the difficulty of this first struggle for differentiation. In this image of a stela at Copan (Fig. 2), the stylized turbulence of the vegetation filling the background assures that the design on the stone and the design of the forest seem mutually derived; even the scale of the clumps of leaves matches that of the monument's carved patterns. Only the deeper contrast of the figure differentiates it from the vegetation and tenuously relegates the forest to a safe atmo- spheric distance. The engraving recalls the stela's original immersion even as it proclaims Catherwood's ultimate con- quest of the scene; the residue of camouflage encodes within the representation its own primordial resistance. This residue of camouflage, this reminder of the stela's previously undiffer- entiated status, accords an ontological force to the act of depiction itself.16 In 1844 Catherwood republished many of these illustra- tions in a folio volume of colored lithographs; here (Figs. 3, 14), a dramatic chiaroscuro conveys the same romance of perception, with a selective illumination providing the only precarious differentiation between the monuments and the forest. With illustrations such as these, Stephens and Cather- wood announce Western expeditionary vision to be some- thing more than simply passive perception. It is a concen- trated, focused, generative perspective--one that the modern travelers have had to import. Like contemporary "Magic Eye" stereographs, which reveal their three-dimensional images only to the practiced eye, Catherwood's images proclaim that it is only with straining and training that difference-the difference between figure and ground, monument and forest, past and present-can be forged from the indiscriminate jungle. Throughout Stephens's narratives, this struggle between discernment and camouflage is also articulated as a histoio- graphical theme. Stephens frequently used light as a meta- phor for historical knowledge, discussing a "ray" or "beam" picking a picture from the surrounding historical obscurity.17 As in many of Catherwood's 1844 lithographs, where the light seems to have searched out the historical monuments from beyond or before the picture plane (Fig. 3), Stephens implies that historiographical perspicacity is not available locally. It is efficient, deictic, and discriminating, and must be manufac- tured by the historicizing eye of the modern traveler. Industry and Idleness Stephens and Catherwood develop the theme of visual and historical manufacture as an explicit counterpoint not only to the indifference of the jungle but also to what they construct as the indifference of the Yucatecans themselves. According to Stephens and Catherwood, the historical obscurity of the</page><page sequence="3">546 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 2000 VOLUME LXXXII NUMBER 3 1 Robert Smithson, Yucatan Mirror Displacement no. 5, 1969.

Estate of Robert Smithson/VAGA, New York) ruins was compounded by the fact that the indigenous inhabitants of the area, although almost certainly blood descendants of the ancient builders, had retained virtually no knowledge of their own history. Nor did they seem interested in attaining that knowledge; in his narrative Stephens often displays less amazement at the monuments themselves than at what he calls "the ignorance, carelessness, and indifference" of the inhabitants toward the monuments.18 As Catherwood put it in 1844, "unfortunately for the antiquarian [the Indians] are totally without historic traditions, nor is their curiosity excited by the presence of the monuments amongst which they live."19 Catherwood's depictions of the "Indians" can only rein- force this impression of indigenous indifference. Even when the ruins he depicts stand outside the thick jungles of Copin or Palenque, the motif of historical obscurity remains active in the image, borne by the indigenous figures themselves. In his illustration of the exterior of the Casa de las Monjas at Uxmal (Fig. 4), for example, the Indians demonstrate their historical incapacity by ignoring the newly cleared monument behind</page><page sequence="4">ROBERT SMITHSON AND JOHN LLOYD STEPHENS IN YUCATAN 547 2 A.

Pinned to the proscenium, their glances indifferent to the background, the Indians are made to appear uninterested in the historical axis of their environment. Detaching them conceptually from the archaeology they frame, Catherwood associates them only with the space (and, it is implied, the order) of the vegetation that provides a foil to the historical building.20 The woman at the left seems to have sprung intact from the maguey plant at her feet, while the akimbo limbs of the reclining man at right mimic the fleshy sprawl of the adjacent cactus. As autochthonous figures, acting almost as afterimages of erstwhile underbrush, they are identified not so much with the historic architecture as with the tenseless vegetation that had until recently obscured it.21 In the course of his narratives Stephens associates this</page><page sequence="5">548 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 2000 VOLUME LXXXII NUMBER 3 3 Andrew Picken, lithograph after Catherwood, Idol at Copdn, 1844, from Catherwood, Views of Ancient Monuments, pL, I indigenous historical indifference with a general lack of industriousness-a lack that then functions throughout the narrative as a foil to Stephens and Catherwood's vigorous habits of modern historical inquiry. In the following outburst of managerial exasperation, Stephens bemoans the indig- enous laborers' reluctance to clear vegetation from the monuments at Copin: ... the Indians, as in the days when the Spaniards discov- ered them, applied to work without ardour, carried it on with little activity, and, like children, were easily diverted from it. One hacked into a tree, and, when tired, which happened very soon, sat down to rest, and another relieved him. While one worked there were always several looking on. I remembered the ring of the woodman's axe in the forests at home, and wished for a few long-sided Green Mountain boys.22 This lack of "ardour" signals for Stephens the historical failure of Mesoamerican civilization; it is a spent or desolate civilization (more on which shortly), one so lethargic that it cannot muster the energy to overcome its terminal state of slothful equilibrium. By the late eighteenth and early nine- teenth centuries in the United States, the sin of sloth had lost most of its theological connotations and had come instead to be classified as a sin against the national economy and against the linear, uniform, unidirectional kind of time on which that economy relied.23 Stephens's various descriptions of indig- enous acedia do indeed suggest that the people of Central America and Yucatin inhabit a different sort of time: lazy, circular, and stagnant. Throughout the narrative, many of the scenes and "incidents" Stephens chooses to relate are thinly disguised allegories for this unproductive inertia; he clearly 4 Andrew Picken, lithograph after Catherwood, Portion of a Building: Las Monjas, Uxmal, 1844, from Catherwood, Views ofAncient Monuments, pI. xiv</page><page sequence="6">ROBERT SMITHSON AND JOHN LLOYD STEPHENS IN YUCATAN 549 believes that the Yucatecans' siesta-bound culture precludes any possibility of their further participation in the "onward impulse" of history:24 Moving on to the high stone structure forming the platform of the well, I saw a little boy, dressed in a straw hat, dozing on an old horse, which was creeping round with the well-beam, drawing in broken buckets a slow stream of water, for which no one came. At sight of me he rose from the neck of his horse, and tried to stop him, but the old animal seemed so used to going round that he could not stop, and the little fellow looked as if he expected to be going till some one came to take him off.25 That "some one" is of course Stephens, the Yankee, whose attempt to reconstruct a historical narrative from the ruins will provide the only linear motion to counter the ramshackle inefficiency of the circular local currents.26 What is perhaps most telling about Stephens's parable of the well is the way it grants the Yucatecans the equipment and materials of history and progress yet renders them too indifferent to be able to take advantage of them. Stephens casts the Yucatecans as incompetent custodians of the glori- ous historical past in evidence all around them. The well pump might be interpreted here as a neglected historical apparatus: history flows unsupervised, unacknowledged, and unassimilated from the depths, evaporating uselessly on the surface of the present. The circular movement around the well beam also suggests an onanistic thematics of Waste and inefficiency. Because the water/history from the depths spills wasted on the ground, the relationship between past and present remains unconsummated and thus powerless to produce knowledge, regeneration, or cultural development. It will be up to Stephens-with his more industrious out- look-to make the overflowing well of Central American history productive. For Stephens and Catherwood, then, both vision and historical awareness require a commitment to progress and industry. Stephens's narrative and Catherwood's illustrations dramatize a difficult genesis, a tearing open of the claustro- philic, primordial jungle to make it into a Western space where figure and ground, fore and aft, present and past can achieve a rational emplotment within a spatial and temporal continuum. Kenneth John Myers has argued that by 1840 in the United States the picturesque mode of seeing (which had begun as a set of exclusively upper-class British conventions) had been thoroughly naturalized, and that American viewers in general were able to "forget the labor of admiring" a landscape.27 But in Yucatin and Central America, it seems, there is a lag; the labor of admiring is not forgotten but obsessively revisited, as if, in the contact zone, the picturesque had to be reinvented.28 Stephens and Catherwood take pains to emphasize the labors of installing modern vision and modern history in an obscuring, indifferent environment. Other Operations At one point in Stephens's narrative, this installment of modern vision adopts gruesomely literal dimensions. Early in the second of their two expeditions,29 Stephens and Cather- 5 Nathaniel Currier, the strabismus operation, 1841, from Post, Observations on the Cure of Strabismus, fig. 5 wood were accompanied by a third traveler, Dr. Samuel Cabot, a Boston surgeon and ornithologist. Cabot had come along primarily to collect zoological specimens, but while the group was waiting in Merida for supplies he offered to bestow his surgical services on the people of the town. He particularly wanted to try out a new surgery that he had recently learned to perform for an ocular affliction called strabismus. In strabismus, also known as "lazy eye," defects in the muscles surrounding one or both eyeballs cause the eye to roll off center, preventing the proper functioning of binocular vision. Patients experience an unresolved visual field, making it difficult to focus and to perceive depth. The surgery required that Stephens and Catherwood assist by pinning the squirming patients' heads to the table and spreading their eyelids apart (Stephens never mentions any form of anesthetic) while Cabot made precise incisions in the offending muscles (Fig. 5).30 Recounting the surgeries, Ste- phens can hardly contain the intrinsic violence of this ostensibly charitable enterprise. He describes the operations in lurid detail over several pages, and finally proclaims that his head was "swimming with visions of bleeding and mutilated eyes.31 Although strabismus was also common in the United States, Stephens's narrative has the effect of associating the disorder with the Yucatecans. This is partially because Stephens notes a higher than usual incidence of strabismus among them: in M6rida "there seemed to be more squinting eyes, or biscos, as they are called, than are usually seen in any one town."32 More important, however, the etiology of strabismus as</page><page sequence="7">550 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 2000 VOLUME LXXXII NUMBER 3 discussed in contemporaneous medical treatises featured traits and behaviors that Stephens had already pejoratively attached to the Yucatecans. For example, strabismus was strongly associated with mental incapacity, both because of the "dulness of look" it produced and because it was often a symptom of neurological diseases and other "cerebral irrita- tions."33 It also suggested infantilism (its onset is nearly always in childhood) and lassitude (it was believed that the wander- ing eye could often be controlled by a well-disciplined patient willing to make the effort toward "proper practice and education").34 It may seem curious that the inability to orchestrate one's eyeballs into position for binocular vision could have been interpreted as immaturity or laziness, but it was during precisely this period that binocular vision was first fully understood as the brain's active resolution of the images it receives from the two separate eyes.35 This had important implications for the prevailing model of vision, which would now be understood not as the passive reception of a preconsti- tuted image but instead as the ability actively to construct a coherent scene from a raw field of divergent visual data. Jonathan Crary has shown that this new model of vision was part of a broader "mapping of the eye as a productive territory" in the early nineteenth century and argues that as vision (along with other physiological processes) was ab- sorbed within metaphors governed by the emergent para- digm of factory production, binocularity itself became equated with a kind of industriousness.36 As he notes in his discussion of the stereoscope: "the apparently passive observer ... by virtue of specific physiological capacities, was in fact made into a producer of forms of verisimilitude. ... The content of the [stereoscopic] images is far less important than the inexhaustible routine of moving from one card to the next and producing the same effect, repeatedly, mechanically."37 Although Crary's hints of drudgery here give binocularity the taint of factory labor, one should also consider the managerial connotations of the process-after all, binocular vision in- volves the coordination and control of two potentially "lazy" eyes. In sum, when associated with an indigenous population and implicitly opposed to civilized, industrious vision, strabis- mus could be made to signify a cultural as well as a visual disorder-a culture unable to break out of an indolent parallax and perform the perspective functions of modern industrial civilization. Given the pervasive equation of vision with historical knowledge throughout Stephens's narrative, it also signals a historical disorder. In all, strabismus signals a culture unable to manufacture the necessary perspective to differentiate its foreground from its background, its present from its past. Within Stephens's narrative, strabismus neatly reinforces, at the level of the body itself, the Yucatecans' indifference, their failure to make use of their potential (potential used here in the sense of a differential). It seems to me that into his lengthy, sanguinary account of the strabismus operation, Stephens has displaced all of the latent violence of the archaeological operation ahead, with its aims to overcome the local myopia by slicing through all obstacles to visual and historical perspective. Historical Prospecting Most of the meager literature on Stephens takes a brighter view of his attitudes toward indigenous culture in Yucatan and Central America.38 This is because Stephens was the first to argue that the Mesoamerican ruins had been erected by Native Americans, ancestors of those he found when he arrived. It was nearly universal at the time to assume that structures of such caliber could only have been conceived extrahemispherically, by a lost tribe from the Old World (favorite candidates included Egyptians and Israelites) or from a lost continent such as Atlantis.39 But Stephens's magnanimous attribution must be qualified by the lengths to which, as I have shown, he and Catherwood go to demon- strate that the indifferent nineteenth-century Maya had not inherited the historical mantle of their ancestors. Their antiquarian ineptitude effectively disqualifies them from any claim to their own history--an abdication that then renders it conveniently available to the United States, whose modern, disciplined intellects become the worthy heirs of this Ameri- can heritage and the rightful directors of any project de- signed to illuminate it. Stephens has also been praised for his enlightened views on race. As Van Wyck Brooks put it, Stephens saw the deplorable condition of the contemporary Maya as "wholly the result of circumstances, for he did not believe in the existence of inferior races."40 Stephens did frequently interpret the indig- enous conditions in historical, rather than essentialist, terms, largely because he could rightly attribute the Mesoamerican denouement to the atrocities and "monkish fanaticism" of the Spanish: as he put it, "with the arrival of the Spaniards the sceptre of the Indians departed."41 He does not, then, imagine the historical indifference that he finds in Yucatan as a state of primordial savagery, nor does he see it as an innocent Arcadia. Rather, to choose a canvas from Thomas Cole's series Course of Empire (with which Stephens would certainly have been familiar, as it was exhibited in New York three years before he left for Central America), the Indians inhabit a state of "Desolation" (Fig. 6), their course of empire exhausted, their history--indeed, their very awareness of history-extinguished. By placing the nineteenth-century Maya within the histori- cal frame of the "Desolate," Stephens was able to recognize the operation of a certain historical causality without going so far as to imagine that history, which had once disenfranchised the Maya, might be equally capable of reempowering them. In this regard he draws on the historical philosophy of American exceptionalism, an attitude shared by many of his contemporaries in the United States. The view held that while all other prosperous empires had suffered declines and falls, subject to the law of the circular "Course of Empire," the United States would enjoy a forever progressive course. Angela Miller has concisely described this belief as a "histori- cal double standard," since it allowed the United States to benefit from the fall of other empires while reserving for itself a historical immunity.42 In this case, the double standard leads Stephens to see the decline of the Maya as inevitable and inarguable, their heritage useful only inasmuch as it will bolster the pedigree of its permanent new curator.43 Ste- phens's "Desolation" label renders the Maya eligible for the</page><page sequence="8">ROBERT SMITHSON AND JOHN LLOYD STEPHENS IN YUCATAN 551 .r r ;,i?.;i:i.J!?-.;lf !; :: .

At no point are the Maya to regain command over their heritage; Ste- phens's aim is the extraction of historical artifacts and their relocation to the United States, the new Pan-American histori- cal epicenter. Consider his gleeful description (under the subheading "An Operation in Prospect") of his plans "To buy Coptn! remove the monuments of a by-gone people from the desolate region in which they were buried, set them up in the 'great commercial emporium,' and found an institution to be the nucleus of a great national museum of American Antiquities!"45 Although Stephens takes great pains to distin- guish his archaeological explorations from the earlier pillag- ings of the Spanish, through his antiquarian's eye the Maya are conquered again. One might wonder why, given what he believed to be the essential enervation of the Maya, Stephens felt it necessary to take the trouble to reconquer the Maya at all. Why the emphasis on the heroic exertion of vision and historiography? Why the hurry to establish a managerial mandate over the ruins? Why the rush to appropriate artifacts? Stephens's emphatic attitude here reveals a specific condition determin- ing the United States' assimilation of Mesoamerican history in the early 1840s: the United States' claim to that history needed to be established not so much over the Maya (too indifferent to be of concern), nor even the Spanish Ameri- cans (whom Stephens represents throughout the narrative as emasculated, bumbling imperial has-beens), but rather over other European nations that might attempt to arrogate this newly discovered history to their own pedigrees and collec- tions. Given this threat, and given that their expedition occurs in the wake of the Monroe Doctrine, Stephens and Cather- wood's Herculean labors of vision/history function almost like homesteading claims. Simply to have viewed this land- scape, to have organized this indifferent field along Western lines of visual and scientific perspective, to have "laid it open" to "rays of historical light," is to have cultivated it. As Stephens narrates, recording one of his bedtime ruminations: Other ruins might be discovered even more interesting and more accessible. Very soon their existence would become known and their value appreciated, and the friends of science and the arts in Europe would get possession of them. They belonged of right to us, and, though we did not know how soon we might be kicked out ourselves, I resolved that ours they should be; with visions of glory and indistinct fancies of receiving the thanks of the corporation flitting before my eyes, I drew my blanket around me, and fell asleep.46 Smithson's Expedition: A Series of Standstills Stephens extracted hundreds of artifacts from the Maya sites, returning to New York with sculptural and architectural remnants that were to form the core collection of his Museum of American Antiquities. But his museum was never built; tragically, he installed the artifacts in Catherwood's new panorama building downtown, only to see the structure and all of its contents destroyed by fire a few weeks later.47 The only comfort in this incalculable misfortune was the fact that a few large stone pieces had yet to arrive by steamer and thus escaped the conflagration. Stephens gave these to his friend John Church Cruger, who proceeded to install them on his personal island in the Hudson River among faux-Gothic, Desolation-style ruins that he had constructed in emulation of a Thomas Cole painting.48 Here the artifacts remained for some eighty years, reduced to anachronistic details in a picturesque folly, until in 1919 the American Museum of Natural History in New York learned of their existence and acquired them from one of Cruger's octogenarian daughters. There, in the museum, they were prominently displayed in the collections of Mexican and Central American antiquities (Fig. 7), and it was there, in the 1940s, that the young Robert Smithson would first have seen them, on one of his many boyhood visits to what was (and would continue to be) his favorite museum.49</page><page sequence="9">552 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 2000 VOLUME LXXXII NUMBER 3 7 Installation of "Stephens Stones," ca. 1965, American Museum of Natural History, New York (Neg. no. 2A7945, courtesy American Museum of Natural History Library) 8 Smithson, A Nonsite (Franklin, New Jersey), 1968. Chicago, Museum of Contemporary Art, Gift of Susan and Lewis Manilow (photo: ? Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago) Smithson, accompanied by his wife Nancy Holt and his friend (and dealer) Virginia Dwan, embarked on his own Yucatin expedition in April 1969.50 By this point in his career, Smithson was executing nearly all of his work in an expedition- ary context. In 1968, the year before his Yucatin tour, he had moved away from the gallery-bound installations that charac- terized his early sculptural career and had begun his impor- tant series of Site/Nonsites. These retained a gallery compo- nent (partially inspired by the display practices of natural history museums)"' but took as their primary theme the relationship between the gallery and a given peripheral site to which Smithson had traveled (Fig. 8). Smithson had also already published his first travelogues, predecessors to the YucatAn essay, including "The Crystal Land" (Harper's Bazaar, May 1966) and "The Monuments of Passaic" (Artforum, December 1967). Another key precedent for the essay was, of course, Ste- phens's Incidents of Travel in Yucatdn. Smithson had a Dover paperback edition of the Incidents in his small collection of books on Mexico and the Maya, and he also had a copy of Catherwood's frontispiece to the 1843 edition.52 It is unclear exactly how closely Smithson read Stephens's narrative, but just as the title of his essay announces that his expedition will substitute "mirror-travel" for Stephens's "travel," Smithson's work on the peninsula constitutes an extended reflection on Stephens's brand of nineteenth-century archaeological exploration. In nearly every respect, Smithson's work in Yucatin can be interpreted as an inversion or undoing of Stephens's opera- tions. Smithson begins his travelogue, for example, by challeng- ing the paradigms of narrative progress that had defined Stephens's entire enterprise. While driving south from M6-</page><page sequence="10">ROBERT SMITHSON AND JOHN LLOYD STEPHENS IN YUCATAN 553 9 Smithson setting up Yucatan Mirror Displacement no. 1, 1969 (photo: Nancy Holt) rida in his rental car, Smithson muses that "one is always crossing the horizon, yet it always remains distant.... The distance seem [s] to put restrictions on all forward movement, thus bringing the car to a countless series of standstills."53 Whereas for Stephens the hard-fought view into depth had anchored the coherent perspectival organization of space and time, assuring its visual, physical, and historical traversibility, here it ensnares the traveler in an impassable network of infinite distances. In Smithson's conception of the region, the landscape immediately proclaims the futility of all attempts at progress. This initial refusal of linear progression (whether visual, physical, or narrative) goes on to shape Smithson's entire travelogue, which is structured around a series of disconnected sculptural installations, indeed, a "series of standstills." During the expedition, these "standstills" took the form of temporary sculptural installations that Smithson arranged at various sites, photographed, and then dismantled. The best known of these are the Mirror Displacements, which both illustrate and structure his written article (each Mirror Dis- placement becomes a subheading within the text). For the displacements, Smithson installed the same group of twelve- inch-square mirrors at nine different sites throughout the region, arranging the mirrors in roughly parallel arrays, either balanced among tree limbs or cantilevered into the soil (Figs. 9, 10). Although this discussion will focus primarily on the Mirror Displacements, Smithson's work in the area also included an Upside-down Tree at Yaxchilan, a series of Over- turned Rocks at Palenque and Uxmal (Fig. 12), a group of root and rock constructions near Palenque, the Hypothetical Continent of Gondwanaland at Uxmal, and a set of slides shot at the Hotel Palenque, which Smithson would later (in 1972) present as a model of "anti-architecture" in a lecture at the University of Utah (Fig. 17).54 Perhaps Smithson's most conspicuous inversion of Ste- phens's precedent derives from the fact that none of the famous Maya ruins appears in any of his illustrations, even though several of the photographs were taken within eyeshot of the major archaeological sites. Dispersed and half-covered 10 Smithson, Yucatan Mirror Displacement no. 1, 1969. NewYork, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum by sediment or branches, the blocky mirrors of the Displace- ments suggest the ruins, but their empty reference to the desired historical spectacle proposes a systematic erasure of Stephens's visionary enterprise (Fig. 11). This refusal to see the Maya ruins amounts in many ways to their paradoxical re-covering-to their removal from the conditions of archae- ology that, over the past century and a half, had endorsed their use as imperialist trophies or their recontextualization as art objects.55 Smithson's series of Overturned Rocks (Fig. 12), done near the ruins of Uxmal, remain his most pointed critique of archaeological activity. Mocking the archaeolo- gist's desire for comprehension ("leaving no stone un- turned"), Smithson proposes that beneath the stones of Yucatan one will find not a historical grounding but "the entrance to the abyss," not the key to Maya cosmology but "a damp cosmos of fungus and mold."56 Smithson's Mirrors: The Dissymmetries of Vision But Smithson's antiarchaeological tactics in this project go beyond his simply not picturing the ruins. His use of mirrors as a medium, especially when considered in the context of his other sculptural work, signals a more systematic attempt to oppose Stephens's visual imperialism and the entire Enlight- enment project that authorized it. Smithson had been using mirrors in his sculptural installations for some five years prior to his Yucatin trip. In each of these constructions, he had rejected the specular potential of mirrors, emphasizing in- stead their capacity to "generate incapacity"-their tendency toward dispersion, fragmentation, or cancellation of visual data.57 Smithson derived his sense of the "incapacity" of mirrors from a source to which he often turned for inspiration- crystallography.

New York, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum 12 Smithson, Overturned Rocks no. 4, 1969. Chromogenic development slides objects or landscapes and their mirror reflections. Enantiomor- phism is a term used in crystallography to denote the relation- ship between two molecules or other forms that mirror each other across a single axis. Although this mirroring of shapes might appear to be a rather pedestrian concept on first consideration, crystallography assures us otherwise. Enantio- morphs belong to a special class of symmetry that is actually closer to a dissymmetry: "the mirror image of [the crystal is] not superposable upon the crystal itself."58 Although the forms are identical in all other respects, one form is neverthe- less irreducible to the other-like the left and right hands, the glove for one of which cannot fit the other. As tantalizingly similar as they may appear, enantiomorphs cannot be recon- ciled. This dissymmetry is often referred to as a screw asymmetry, and it implies a temporal as well as a spatial irreducibility. Two enantiomorphic forms cannot be brought into alignment except through passage in four dimensions- through, as it were, a turn of the screw. As explained in one of Smithson's books on physics: The left side of a straight line can be interchanged with its right side by rotating the line in a plane, the clockwise direction on a surface can be interchanged with an anticlockwise direction by moving the surface in three- dimensional space (turning over), a left-hand screw with a right-hand screw-or the left hand with the right hand-by "moving" the object in four-dimensional space.59 Thus, the two sides of an enantiomorph cannot be resolved or made identical in a moment of perceptual gestalt; an enantio- morphic reflection harbors within itself an irreducible spatio- temporal gap. The enantiomorphic motif appears throughout Smithson's work. He applied it not only to the reflections of his literal mirror-pieces but also to his ideas about history, memory, cognition, semiosis, and representation, all of which also incorporate motifs of reflection. It marked for him an elemental failure of adequation--"a mirror looking for its reflection but never quite finding it.'"60 Smithson's seizing on the idea of enantiomorphism as his general model of reflec-</page><page sequence="12">ROBERT SMITHSON AND JOHN LLOYD STEPHENS IN YUCATAN 555 tion is, I think, the aspect of his work that most fully approximates poststructuralism. Although Smithson was al- most certainly unaware ofJacques Derrida's work, enantiomor- phism offers a more than passable model of differance (Derri- da's keyword for the difference that evades, precedes, and constitutes all presence-a difference that operates both spatially and temporally, that both differs and defers).61 Enantio- morphism provides a model of resemblance but offers no ground on which a metaphysics of presence can take hold; it constitutes an identity riven by alterity. Indeed, the fault line, central axis, or hinge of the enantiomorphic reflection, called a dislocation in crystallographic terminology, perfectly encap- sulates the empty center of postmodern subjectivity.62 Smithson extended this essential dislocation to the act of vision itself, demonstrated most explicitly in his 1964 piece Enantiomorphic Chambers. In this piece, Smithson synthesizes stereochemistry and crystallography with physiological optics, locating the enantiomorphic dislocation right between the eyes of the seeing subject. The piece was constructed from two wall-hung steel supports holding mirrors set at oblique angles precisely calculated so that when a viewer stood between the two chambers, the mirrored images canceled themselves out and "abolish[ed] the central fused image" (Fig. 13).63 The installation invites the viewer to occupy the point of conver- gence of the two separate images (the point at which one would normally expect to find the consciousness that regu- lates binocular vision), but then evacuates the very space in which that convergence might occur. Smithson worked out the idea for the Chambers by sketching directly on top of a stereoscope diagram in one of his books on physiological optics, planning out a structure that would produce "infinite myopia" rather than vision in depth: "The two separate 'pictures' that are usually placed in a stereoscope have been replaced by two separate mirrors in my Enantiomor- phic Chambers-thus excluding any fixed image."64 Smithson's enantiomorphic stereoscope thwarts, rather than facilitates, three-dimensional perception. In a 1967 essay called "Point- less Vanishing Points," Smithson described the piece, appeal- ing to the essential binarism of human vision in order to propose that there can be no such thing as an eidetic perception: "The binocular focus of our eyes converges on a single object and gives the illusion of oneness, so that we tend to forget the actual stereoscopic structure of our two eyes or what I will call 'enantiomorphic vision'-that is seeing double."'"65 "Oneness" is not the natural state of the visual field; it is an illusion that must be forged by resolving the differential in the viewpoints of the two eyeballs. The Enantio- morphic Chambers makes manifest the disconnection that exists prior to the labor of perspectival illusion. Is this not an uncanny return to strabismus, a correction of Dr. Cabot's corrections, an antisurgery that might restore what Stephens had described as the "crisscross expression" of the indigenous perspective? As Smithson asks in his YucatAn essay, "why not reconstruct one's inability to see?"66 Indeed, at many points Smithson's Yucatin essay recounts this "inability to see," often evoking the physiology of strabismus and other binocular disorders: The eyes, being infected by all kinds of nameless tropisms, couldn't see straight. Vision sagged, caved in, and broke 13 Smithson, Enantiomorphic Chambers, 1964. Location unknown apart. ... Squinting helped somewhat, yet that didn't keep views from tumbling over each other... How could that section of visibility be put together again? Perhaps the eyes should have been screwed up into a sharper focus. But no, the focus was at times cock-eyed, at times myopic, overex- posed, or cracked.67 Smithson describes himself as a blinded traveler, stumbling not through a fully constituted, picturesque landscape but through a split "section of visibility." By inhabiting the overlapping, kaleidoscopic visual field of "lazy" eye, he cancels out Stephens's efforts to impose European perspec- tive on the YucatAn Peninsula. He offers "a type of 'anti- vision' or negative seeing" against Stephens's penetrating vision.68 In much of the existing scholarship, Smithson's career-long penchant for "negative seeing" has emerged as one of his most influential and praiseworthy artistic innovations. Craig Owens showed how Smithson's demystification of vision allowed him to exploit the reciprocity of the visual and the verbal, "transform [ing] the visual field into a textual one" and prefiguring postmodernist concerns with text and dis- course.69 Ann Reynolds has demonstrated how Smithson's deconstruction of binocularism constituted a learned and withering critique of Clement Greenberg's then-hegemonic aesthetics, based as they were on an ideal of disembodied, pure "opticality," which Smithson showed up as a logical and corporeal impossibility.70 Gary Shapiro and Rosalind Krauss have detailed the deeper philosophical implications of this refutation of modernist opticality, equating Smithson's cri- tique of the video with the philosophical project of interrogat- ing the Cartesian cogito.71 Krauss puts it concisely: with Smithson's deconstruction of binocular vision comes "the disappearance of the first person."72 This is certainly borne out in the excerpt above, where Smithson positions him"self" not as a unitary subject but rather as irretrievably bicameral; the subject of his sentences is not "I" but "the eyes." But more attention needs to be paid to the inspirations for, and implications of, Smithson's deployment of "anti-vision."</page><page sequence="13">556 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 2000 VOLUME LXXXII NUMBER 3 Without denying the subversive intentions or the intellectual sophistication of Smithson's models of blindness, it is nonethe- less important to recognize the primitivist underpinnings of his reversion to "lazy eyes," to scrutinize the image (I use the word advisedly) of the Maya and of Mexico that this reversion encourages, and to explore the ways in which this image, deployed as it is in the late 1960s, constitutes a specific political position. Double Vision as Low-Level Perception The Yucatan Mirror Displacements present two pictures simultaneously, a di-vision: a view of the landscape at which the camera points, partially obscured by the mirrors, and another view (usually skyward), partially caught on the mir- rors. Neither view is complete, nor can the two be consoli- dated into a unified spatial whole. The mirrors' reference to ruination (in their scattered, half-buried arrangement) thus extends to their effect on the space around them-they act literally to de-compose or ruin the illusion of Euclidian space. It is important to note that this decomposition is produced bilaterally, enantiomorphically. The mirrors do not aim ran- domly into haphazard corners of space; such a chaotic arrangement would actually act to draw the surrounding space into the installation, and through that implosion would paradoxically serve to affirm the centrality of the mirrors, their function as anchors. What is striking about the mirrors is the care with which Smithson has installed each so that its face parallels the others, as if the array were a single delicate instrument, tuned to receive a specific frequency or to observe a specific quadrant of the heavens (Fig. 10). Thus, the Mirror Displacements, rather than scattering the view into an infinite tangle, produce their decomposition by means of a binary overlap. As in double vision, the unitary visual field of perspective space splits apart, crosses over, and shallows out; the difference between the two points of view (the "retinal rivalry" of binocular vision) fails to be resolved into an illusion of coherent depth. The inherent differential between the two points of view, we might say, fails to produce binocular work. It is as if the two spaces were collapsing around a single hinge, as if space has been infolded. The Mirror Displacements thus cast Smithson's entire expedition-Smithson's encoun- ter with the landscape, with the Mexican Other, with the history of the Maya, and with the memory of Stephens's previous expedition-into enantiomorphic collapse. The en- tire project becomes one of "seeing double." Smithson's double vision suggests the eternal misalignment of the travelers' perception. He muses on this misalignment at length in the Yucatin essay, calling the entire travel narrative tradition-traveling, seeing, representing-into question: Some "enantiomorphic" travel through Villahermosa, Frontera, Ciudad del Carmen, past the Laguna de Termi- nos. Two asymmetrical trails that mirror each other could be called enantiomorphic after those two common enantio- morphs-the right and left hands. Eyes are enantio- morphs. Writing the reflection is supposed to match the physical reality, yet somehow the enantiomorphs don't quite fit together. The right hand is always at variance with the left.73 Considered in the context of the expeditionary tradition, this amounts to a humble (and humbling) statement, one that approaches contemporary postcolonialism in its recognition of the recalcitrance of the colonized Other.74 Yet in another, deeply paradoxical, sense, Smithson uses this misalignment as a tool of access, as a way of allowing, rather than precluding, an understanding of (and immersion in) the landscape and culture he visits. To begin with, although his "enantiomorphic travel" seems to recognize the impossibility of any fusion with the Other, Smithson describes his collapsing, double vision through the sculptural and verbal vocabularies of indolence, thus reproduc- ing for himself the same "indifferent" status that Stephens had originally predicated on the Yucatecans. Smithson joins the Yucatecans in their primordial, indifferent, strabismic condition-their perceptual insouciance. We might say that as Smithson travels his eyes fall out of alignment with each other and into alignment with nature. The eyes are relaxed, the ardor of binocular vision forsworn. Primordial visual perception, unburdened by binocular exertion, simply mirrors the environment around it: "Small bits of sediment dropped away from the sand flats into the river. Small bits of perception dropped away from the edges of eyesight.... Particles of matter slowly crumbled down the slope that held the mirrors. Tinges, stains, tints, and tones crumbled into the eyes."'75 Enantiomorphic vision, according to Smithson, mimics the essence of nature itself; as he put it, he was interested not in any "idealistic notion of perception" but rather in "zeroing in on those aspects of mental experience that somehow coincide with the physical world.''76 And it is precisely because for Smithson this physical world was already riven by enantio- morphic irreducibility and entropic decline that his enantio- morphic vision could be said to "coincide" with it. In a 1969 interview, Smithson described his method of apprehending a site as "a kind of low level scanning, almost unconscious."77 He borrowed the term "low-level scanning" from Anton Ehrenzweig's 1967 book The Hidden Order of Art. Ehrenzweig, whose influence on Smithson's working method would be difficult to overstate, developed a psychology of artistic creativity that advocated the value of "unconscious" modes of vision and attention.78 Ehrenzweig describes low- level vision as syncretic, as a form of vision that can ignore the distinctions between figure and ground by "hold[ing] them in a single unfocused glance"79 and that can apprehend a mass of concrete detail without consciously identifying it. Ehrenzweig included this low-level syncretism within his broader concept of "dedifferentiation," another keyword that Smithson often deployed, and perhaps the closest syn- onym to "indifference" in the sense that Smithson intended. For Ehrenzweig, low-level vision uses low levels of energy; it is a simple "gathering," a purely receptive faculty, indifferently absorbing undifferentiated visual refuse.8o Smithson's enantio- morphic model of vision produces the same effect; without the viewer expending stereographic effort, the eyes remain disconnected receptacles: "The eyes became two wastebaskets filled with diverse colors, variegations, ashy hues, blotches and</page><page sequence="14">ROBERT SMITHSON AND JOHN LLOYD STEPHENS IN YUCATAN 557 sunburned chromatics."81 The eyes remain indifferent to the potential views before them. Leaving Difference Alone A contradiction may seem to be developing here. First I emphasized Smithson's profound sense of difference, now I speak of his indifference. Smithson's Yucatin project actually deploys both conditions in a dialectical relation; this is perhaps best summarized by saying that Smithson's project remains indifferent to difference. Smithson's Mirror Displacements recognize the essential difference at the heart of all cognition, all vision, all memory, but they leave that difference alone, in what we might call its primordial state, without attempting (as did Stephens) to refine, resolve, or process it into an illusion of unified space and continuous historical time. The Displace- ments are relaxations of vision and, thus, of landscape; they permit the landscape, still propped open, perhaps, by the work of modern vision, to fold back in upon itself, back to the indifferent overlap that Stephens had originally troped in his dramatization of indigenous strabismus.82 The Enlighten- ment space that Stephens had cleared and held open with his stereoscopic exertions (Fig. 14) is systematically re-collapsed by the strabismic interfolding of Smithson's Mirror Displace- ments (Fig. 15). Smithson is not simply proposing a new, indifferent perspec- tive on a unified nature, he is proposing a form of vision that permits nature's essential in-difference to be revealed. For example, he repeatedly describes the light itself as if it were indifferent, unwilling to gather itself into purposeful rays, overtaken by the forces of gravity: "The rays are shattered, broken bits of energy, no stronger than moonbeams."" He speaks of the "load" of perception, noting, "In the jungle all light is paralyzed."84 Smithson's use of color in the essay further emphasizes the exhaustion of the natural environment. Smithson describes the region as suffering under an excess of color, which, as he says, "is the diminution of light."85 Color for Smithson is light at a lower energy level, spent light, light wrecked into its prismatic elements and destined, like Humpty Dumpty (one of Smithson's favorite illustrations of entropy) to remain dismembered. Once fallen, once broken into color, it contrib- utes to the general gravity of the area: "an excess of green sunk any upward movement" (Fig. 1);86 "Refracting sparks of sunshine seemed smothered under the weight of clouded mixtures-yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet."87 The collapse of the visual field in Yucatin is attended in Smithson's narrative by the collapse of the historical field. Smithson had long been declaring his opposition to "most notions of time," particularly linear models based on human- ism, progress, evolution, and avant-gardism.88 In a 1966 essay he articulated his preferred sense of temporality: "Its balance is fragile and precarious, and drained of all notions of energy, yet it has a primordial grandeur. It takes one's mind to the very origins of time-to the fundamental memory."89 This passage, with its fascination with "origins" and its evocation of a phenomenon "drained of all notions of energy," shares the same vocabulary that Smithson used to invoke an indifferent, primordial mode of vision. In accordance with this temporal energy drain, Smithson's Mirror Displacements function as models of passive memory as well as passive vision. In a draft of the Yucatin essay, he wrote that "the color of past time is forever passing through the sky," and that "the sky reflected down its 'involuntary memory' in 12" squares of blue ....",90 (Fig. 16). He referred here to Marcel Proust, or rather, to Samuel Beckett's book Proust, which he owned and had annotated heavily. Beckett, in this early piece of criticism, identified involuntary memories (such as the madeleine episode of Swann's Way) as reliant on the field of inattention, of everyday routines and situations, precisely those normally considered boring or unmemorable: the field, as Beckett put it, of "Dullness" and "Habit."91 In acting as receptors for a Proustian species of involuntary memory, Smithson's Mirror Displacements equate memory not with history but with habit, not with energy but with ennui. They suggest a being-reminded-of instead of a compo- sitional re-membering.92 As mnemonic instruments, Smithson's Mirror Displace- ments flirt with their own undoing; memory becomes, oxymo- ronically, lethargic (from the Greek lethe, oblivion or forgetful- ness). Unsupported by mnemonic historical effort, the edifice of time collapses, like the edifice of vision, into an indifferent field of binocular overlap. Thus, in one essay Smithson wrote, "The future criss-crosses the past as an unobtainable pres- ent."93 In another he spoke of " [a] double perspective of past and future that follows a projection that vanishes into a nonexistent present."94 In the YucatAn essay itself he noted that one of his installations "caused a collision in time that left one with a sense of the timeless."95 The Crystallization of Difference: Smithson and IUvi-Strauss What was the ultimate shape of this "sense of the timeless," this indifference to historical difference, in Smithson's Yu- catin project? I have been describing it thus far as a vague interfolding, overlapping, or collapse, but I would now like to suggest that this "collapse" has a structure. Smithson's enantiomorphic deconstructions of Stephens's YucatAn views produce, in the aggregate, a kind of spontaneous construc- tion of their own. This construction might best be described as a crystalline field, a field formed of facets, each facet an ossification of one instant or angle of displacement. Smithson deploys his Yucatin Mirror Displacements as a series ("a series of standstills"). In Smithson's work, seriality involves not pure repetition or reiteration (he is not prone to setting up series of identical objects) but rather accretion, concre- tion, and diminution. Each "incident" in a Smithson series is subject to the altered conditions presented by the last, as in the bins of his Nonsite (Fig. 8), which diminish progressively in size."96 In the case of the Yucatin project, this diminution occurs imaginatively rather than literally; the "foldings" allowed by each displacement become a progressive invagina- tion of the entire landscape or region. Taken as a whole, the project creates a progression of refractions, a series of cleavages that structure the contraction of the landscape. With the obliquity of primordial difference left to itself, the landscape is not so much "viewed" or "pictured" as allowed to crystallize. Although resulting from what might be called a natural process of primordial historicity, although relying on dis-</page><page sequence="15">558 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 2000 VOLUME LXXXII NUMBER 3 14 W. Parrott, lithograph after Catherwood, Idol and Altar at Copdn, 1844, from Catherwood, Views ofAncient Monuments, pl. v. New Haven, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University tance, belation, and separation, the kind of history that might exist in this crystallized landscape nevertheless recuperates, as a whole, a sense of eternity, immersion, and even presence. Difference and distance, in both space and time, are rendered lapidary, congealed, and, most important, stilled. The land- scape is locked into a latticework that, in its equilbrium, homogeneity, and glinting beauty, perversely recuperates a sense of timelessness. From the outset of his career, Smithson had identified the crystal as an instrument for wresting timelessness from time and history. Consider his 1967 article "Ultramoderne," in which he argued that the mirrored, crystalline spaces of Art Deco architecture (partially influ- enced by Maya architecture) trapped time in multifaceted structures, producing a "vertiginous immobility" and "trans- historical consciousness."97 In this sort of structure, history is not really necessary, because the past, through its kaleido- scopic intermixing with the present, is always at hand. To occupy this crystalline time field is to be at one with time and with all times, to be in synchrony with the universe at large. The refractions of distance, difference, and belation are captured in ajewel-like surround. A similar concept of mirrored, crystalline time crops up in one of Smithson's favorite novels: J. G. Ballard's The Crystal World (1966). In his story, Ballard imagines a tropical forest in Africa that freezes into an interlocking, impassable tangle of delicate crystal forms. The forms result from an apocalyptic process in which time abandons its linear flow and locks itself into space, "deliquescing" into mirrored spatial reverbera- tions. As one character marvels, "It's as if a sequence of displaced but identical images of the same object were being produced by refraction through a prism, but with the element of time replacing the role of light.'"98 Ballard's crystalline forest recalls Smithson's Yucatan vitrifications (Fig. 15) both in its intimations of doubling, inertia, and collapse and in the suggestion that the end state of time amounts to a return to a primordial beginning: "This illuminated forest in some way</page><page sequence="16">15 Smithson, Yucatan Mirror Displacement no. 7, 1969 16 Smithson, Yucatan Mirror Displacement no. 4, 1969</page><page sequence="17">560 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 2000 VOLUME LXXXII NUMBER 3 reflects an earlier period of our lives, perhaps an archaic memory we are born with of some ancestral paradise where the unity of time and space is the signature of every leaf and flower."99 Perhaps Smithson's most important source for his concep- tion of "archaic memory" was the work of Claude Levi- Strauss. Levi-Strauss had explained the ahistorical character of "savage" thought by evoking a crystalline, infolded struc- ture. In this passage, which Smithson carefully underlined in his copy of the 1967 Yale French Studies special issue on structuralism, Levi-Strauss compares primordial myth to mu- sic and shows how both are able to convert their inherent diachronism into an essentially synchronic structure. He may as well be describing Smithson's Mirror Displacements: This relationship to time is of a very special nature: everything takes place as though music and mythology needed time only in order to deny its place. Both, in effect, are mechanisms designed to do away with time. ... The act of listening to the musical work has immobilized the passage of time because of the work's internal organiza- tion; like a cloth billowing in the wind, it has caught up and infolded it.100 (underlining Smithson's; italics mine) Elsewhere, Levi-Strauss compares primitive logic to a kalei- doscope,T'0 writing that within the mind of the primitive " [a] multitude of images forms simultaneously, none exactly like any other, so that no single one furnishes more than a partial knowledge ... ."102 Smithson made his connection to Levi- Strauss abundantly clear by using a long quote from The Savage Mind as one of the two epigraphs of "Incidents of Mirror-Travel in the Yucatan": The characteristic feature of the savage mind is its timeless- ness; its object is to grasp the world as both a synchronic and a diachronic totality and the knowledge which it draws therefrom is like that afforded of a room by mirrors fixed on opposite walls, which reflect each other (as well as objects in the intervening space) although without being strictly parallel.103 Primitive temporality becomes a paragon of structuralist synchrony, trapping the flow of time within a crystalline play of mirrors in order to neutralize it and make it static. Levi-Strauss's model of primitive timelessness also related to Smithson's interest in lethargy and indifference. According to LUvi-Strauss, modern, or "hot," societies, in order to maintain their progressive goals and their highly differenti- ated functions, expend energy quickly, whereas primitive, or "cold," societies attempt to maintain their social and eco- nomic structures in a state of equilibrium. Levi-Strauss bases this distinction on a thermodynamic interpretation of society and culture: In short, societies are rather like machines, and it is a well known fact that there are two main types of machine: mechanical machines and thermodynamic machines. The former are those which use the energy with which they were supplied at the outset and which, in theory, could go on operating indefinitely with this energy.... Thermody- namic machines, on the other hand, such as the steam- engine, operate on the basis of a difference in temperature between their component parts, between the boiler and the condenser; they can do a tremendous amount of work, far more than the others, but in the process they use up and destroy their energy.104 This idea that different kinds of societies have fundamentally different relationships to energy had a strong impact on Smithson, not least because of his career-long fascination with entropy. In a casual interview a few months after his trip to the peninsula, he was quite specific in his praise of The Savage Mind as a thermodynamic model of culture, as well as in his preference for the "cold" approach.105 Levi-Strauss argues, moreover, that the thermodynamic status of a given culture not only determines its economic and cultural life but also predicts its attitudes toward history. History is a high-entropy endeavor: whereas cold societies attempt, "by the institutions they give themselves, to annul the possible effects of historical factors on their equilibrium and continuity in a quasi-automatic fashion," hot societies operate by "resolutely internalizing the historical process and making it the moving power of their development."106 In these passages (which Smithson underlined in his copy of The Savage Mind), we find an echo of the distinction I have been making between Stephens's historiographic industry and Smithson's historiographic idleness. Historical indifference is passive, natural, "quasi-automatic," while historicism is liter- ally a form of industriousness. Levi-Strauss argues that history is a form of work that draws its energy from a differential established between past and present. He sees these differentiating exertions as a departure from the crystalline temporal unity with nature that primitives enjoy: "primitives distrust history because they see in it the beginning of the separation, the beginning of the exile of man adrift in the cosmos."107 Primitive societies, then, have never warmed up to historical difference: they remain static, "indifferent," they "function at a temperature of absolute zero--not zero as understood by the physicist, but in the 'historical' sense."108 Exercised as it is in the Maya region, inspired as it is by Levi-Strauss, Smithson's attach- ment to the "cold society" shows how comfortably minimal- ism's "cool" sensibility and conceptual art's "aesthetic of indifference" could be aligned with structural anthropology's primitivist tendency to dehistoricize the cultures under its consideration.1" Of course, Levi-Strauss harbors no illusions of a truly present "presence" of primitive timelessness. He recognizes that the savage mind is caught up in temporality. But he imagines that mind folding temporal difference in against itself, crystallizing difference into an armorial structure that remains inviolable to historical narrative. History is "an- nulled" in a "quasi-automatic" fashion. This is why, in his 1966 essay "Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences," Jacques Derrida argues that Levi-Strauss's method "compels a neutralization of time and history."110 Derrida suggests that despite LUvi-Strauss's profound aware- ness of difference, "one no less perceives in his work a sort of ethic of presence, an ethic of nostalgia for origins, an ethic of archaic and natural innocence .. ."111 One perceives something of the same ethic at work in</page><page sequence="18">ROBERT SMITHSON AND JOHN LLOYD STEPHENS IN YUCATAN 561 Smithson's work. Smithson's "Crystal World" in Yucatin provides a certain inoculation of low-level difference, one that will crystallize and prevent the penetration of politics, histori- cal narrative, and other contentious forms of modern differ- ential behavior. He wrote in his "Ultramoderne" essay about the "invincible idleness" of primitive time: "All the arduous efforts of all the monumental ages are contained in the ultra-instants, the atemporal moments, or the cosmic seconds. This is a return to a primitive inertia or invincible idle- ness.... l112 It remains to be shown how Smithson's embrace of "primitive inertia" relied on not just a generalized 1960s primitivitism but also on specific contemporary attitudes toward Mexico, Central America, and pre-Columbian civiliza- tion. The remainder of this essay will explore this issue. The "Invincible Idleness" of Mexico In the United States in the late 1960s, the prevailing view was that ancient Maya society had been essentially prehistoric. On the first page of Victor W. Von Hagen's World of the Maya (which Smithson carried with him as he drove through the area), we learn that the ancient Maya, despite their "glyph- writ system," were a "preliterate people."'3 Although a historical view of the Maya was beginning to take hold among specialized epigraphers, in 1969 the Maya hieroglyphs were still generally perceived through the entrenched ideas of Eurocentric anthropology, which had assumed all along that the ancient Maya, despite their mathematical prowess, had been a relatively primitive culture without the capacity to develop a true written language or a comprehension of historical time. It was understood that a large percentage of the glyphs on any given Maya monument were dates-dates, moreover, that placed each object within an elaborate and incredibly precise series of calendrical cycles. But these dates were interpreted as part of a complex mythological system of prophecy and mysticism, not as a measurement of mundane human affairs. It was thought that the Maya worshiped time itself, and that their worship constituted a pure, cultic calendricism unsullied by modern notions of history or politics.14 As Octavio Paz stated in 1970, "From the Mexican high plateau to the tropical lands of Central America, for more than two thousand years, various cultures and empires succeeded one another and none of them had historical consciousness. Meso-America did not have history but myths and, above all, rites."115 For this reason, it seemed appropri- ate to Smithson to apply L~vi-Strauss's theories of "savage" cognition to the Maya. The ancient Maya were imagined as a prehistoric, mysterious, ritualistic cult, ineluctably estranged from European historical and philosophical systems. The prevailing conception of Maya temporality as tangled with time but impervious to historical narrative accorded well with Smithson's crystalline field of temporal indifference/ dedifferentiation. In other ways as well, Smithson's Yucatan narrative was commensurate with the broader cultural project of dehistoricizing the ancient Maya. For example, Smithson evokes the Maya exclusively through mythology, perpetuating what Mircea Eliade called "the corrosive action of mythiciza- tion" on history.116 The ancient Maya appear in Smithson's text not as a historical people but as muses; they arise only as gods, eternally haunting the peninsula, appearing unexpect- edly in Smithson's rearview mirror or addressing him through 17 Smithson, Hotel Palenque no. 7, 1969. New York, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum the air conditioner of his rented Dodge Dart.'17 This is not to say that Smithson uses the myths simplistically-Rebecca Butterfield has demonstrated Smithson's savvy in choosing his deities"8--but merely to point out that Smithson's project takes no interest in the Maya as historical actors. One might argue that at least Smithson respects the mythological integrity of the site. Unfortunately, even that point of view is compromised by the fact that most of the gods with speaking parts in the text are Aztec, not Maya. They dispense commentary and advice that often has nothing to do with Maya mythology. For example, Texcatlipoca (Aztec god of the smoking mirror) implores Smithson to "travel at random, like the first Mayans"-advice that derives not from any Maya or even Aztec codex but from the 1961 Michel Butor novel Degrees.9" Among the Mirror Displacements and other illustra- tions in Smithson's article, there is one photograph of a Mesoamerican artifact-but it is Olmec. Smithson's notion of Maya culture tends toward a hodgepodge of Mesoamerican primitivism, and the kaleidoscopic Mesoamerican Otherness it suggests remains fully commensurate with his model of crystalline dedifferentiation. In 1972, Smithson gave a slide lecture for architecture students at the University of Utah about the Hotel Palenque (he had taken the slides during the 1969 expedition but did not include them in his article). In the lecture, he equated the ramshackle contemporary hotel with the ancient ruins nearby (Fig. 17): My feeling is that this hotel is built with the same spirit that the Mayans built their temples. Many of the temples changed their facades continually: there are sort of facades within facades overlapping facades, facades on facades. You know this window is actually looking out over the things that we went there to see but you won't see any of those temples in this lecture; that's something that you</page><page sequence="19">562 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 2000 VOLUME LXXXII NUMBER 3 have to go there to see for yourself, and I hope that you go to the hotel Palenque so that you learn something about how the Mayans are still building. The structure has all of the convolution and terror, in a sense, that you would find in a typical Mayan temple--especially of the Uxmal variety which is ... called Mayan Baroque and made out of serpentine facades loaded with spirals and rocks carved in the shape of woven twigs and things; it's quite nice. So that to me this window, this seemingly useless window really called forth all sorts of truths about the Mexican tempera- ment.120 Advocating a dysfunctional architecture balanced between ruin and renewal, Smithson's Palenque talk deserves a place among the seminal texts of early deconstruction. But what are the "truths about the Mexican temperament" that have inspired this radical revision of modern architectural theory? The truths are certainly not historical; Smithson's image of "facades within facades overlapping facades, facades on facades" proposes, as do his Mirror Displacements, a jewel- like ensnarement of historical facets. What is troublesome about these "truths," in fact, is that Smithson has rendered them eternal; exhibiting a textbook primitivism, the lecture folds all of Yucatecan history and politics into this homogeneous "convolution." Smithson makes no distinction between "the Mexican temperament" and the "Mayan Baroque"; the people he meets in Mexico in 1969, despite centuries of conquest, revolution, and creoliza- tion, remain changeless icons of the mythological Maya. According to Smithson, the Hotel Palenque's (and the entire region's) "complete wreckage situation"121 derives from eter- nal natural laws, not from specific political or historical conditions: "One can't figure out why they put that door there but it seems to belong, it seems to have some incredible sort of Mayan necessity. It just grew up sort of like a tropical growth, a sort of Mexican geologic, man-made wonder."122 Since the neutralization of historical time is perhaps Smith- son's primary concern in the Yucattn project, such eternaliz- ing strategies are hardly surprising. Yet given the political crises consuming the area in 1969, it is important to recognize the obstinacy of Smithson's indifference to history here. He could not have been unaware, for example, of the alarming rise in guerrilla and terrorist violence in Guatemala (over a thousand murders between the summer of 1967 and the summer of 1968),123 or of the growing concerns in the American media about the failure of the United States- sponsored Alliance for Progress.124 Even the primordial junglescapes of the Mirror Displacements must have seemed synonymous with guerrilla warfare to a Vietnam-era artist.'125 Violence occasionally erupts into Smithson's essay, but only inasmuch as it is displaced, like the design logic of the Hotel Palenque, into a mythologized, primordial principle: Through the windshield the road stabbed the horizon, causing it to bleed a sunny incandescence. One couldn't help feeling that this was a ride on a knife covered with solar blood .... Just sitting there brought one into the wound of a terrestrial victim. This peaceful war between the elements is ever present in Mexico-an echo, perhaps, of the Aztec and Mayan human sacrifices.'"26 Thus eternalized and mythologized, the political violence adopts the cloak of inevitability. Smithson's YucatAn becomes host to an enduring, primordial "war of the elements." Notions of political causality, historical change, or progressive activism are rendered both futile and irrelevant in such territory. Smithson's treatment of the horizon theme is telling in this regard; the horizon functions as a symbol not of hope or anticipation but rather of apathy: "Driving away from Merida down Highway 261 one becomes aware of the indiffer- ent horizon. Quite apathetically it rests on the ground devouring everything that looks like something."127 There is no point in attempting progress. The Yucatin landscape will indifferently disperse every effort at visual, historical, and political resolution. Although Smithson's Yucatin project tends to express this political fatalism indirectly, it is not difficult to locate a similar tone in more manifestly political analyses of Central and Latin America at the time. A survey of discussions on the subject in Smithson's library, all of which stress the enormity of the social and political problems facing the region, reveals a palpable undercurrent of hopelessness. Alternating between sympathy and condescension for the populations of the area, much of this literature views the violence, anarchy, and corruption in Central America as endemic and insurmount- able. Peter Nehemkis sees the area's problems in epidemic terms: "For the truth of the matter is that Latin America is a sick society. It is sick politically. It is sick economically. It is sick spiritually. Each sickness feeds upon the others and the malaise is total."'128 Richard Gott writes that "nobody ever realistically opens much of a perspective for Latin America."129 Smithson, essentially, did not have to look far in Latin American political theory to find echoes of his own sense of entropic indifference: Latin American military regimes, ac- cording to Gott, "have a certain blandness," and even the currently peaceful regions could attain only "a depressing air of aimless stability."130 Nancy Holt has attested that Smithson considered the Latin American nations to be models of "entropic" government.131 Smithson himself claims that this futility is naturally embodied in the attitude of the "natives," who acquiesce calmly to "the grand nullity of their own past attainments."'132 Smithson constructs their soporific resigna- tion as a model for his own entropic attitudes. Smithson's fatalism here may echo contemporaneous politi- cal discussions about Latin America, but it also accords with his own broader political philosophy. Informed by entropic theory and finding apparent confirmation in the global political crises of the late 1960s, Smithson was, during this period, interpreting political events as part of the inevitably entropic tendency of all world systems. To the perpetual frustration of his more politically active colleagues, he es- chewed political activism as counterproductive: "I think that if you strive towards some kind of ideal you'll inevitably end up in a terrible mess. And other messes will be developing right along. What I say is that all one can do, unfortunately, is perceive these messes as they take place.'13"" The pervasive passivism of Smithson's Yucatin project can, in fact, be read as a specific rebuttal to the political activism of many of his colleagues. The Art Workers' Coalition held its first open hearing at the School of Visual Arts (attended by three hundred New York artists) on April 10, 1969, just five</page><page sequence="20">ROBERT SMITHSON AND JOHN LLOYD STEPHENS IN YUCATAN 563 days before Smithson left for Yucatan. According to Lucy Lippard, Smithson was no friend of the coalition; she identi- fied Smithson, Richard Serra, and Philip Leider as "notorious sightseers" of the AWC: "as long as they play with themselves in the bar, telling everyone how absurd or mismanaged the AWC is ... they will be the bane and to some extent the downfall of the Coalition."134 Smithson's trip to Yucatan, then, occurred just as his carefully constructed philosophies of indifference were com- ing to loggerheads with the activist awakening of the NewYork art community. His dismissal of his colleagues' activism can be explained (if not excused) by noting that his stance was not exactly apathetic; for him, passivism was a reasoned choice, the only response to contemporary politics consistent with his intellectual background. From Smithson's entropic perspec- tive, struggles against political injustice would only waste energy and aggravate the situation. As he said in 1970, "one keeps dropping into a kind of political centrifugal force that throws the blood of atrocities onto those working for peace."135 His use of the image of the centrifuge here recalls his earlier illustration of the futility of attempting to overcome the forces of entropy: Picture in your mind's eye [a] sand box divided in half with black sand on one side and white sand on the other. We take a child and have him run hundreds of times clockwise in the box until the sand gets mixed and begins to turn grey; after that we have him run anti-clockwise, but the result will not be a restoration of the original division but a greater degree of greyness and an increase of entropy.136 Political action amounts to little more than running around in circles; regardless of the direction, disorder can only be increased. Faced with this situation, Smithson felt that the task of the artist was to cultivate a thoroughgoing acedia: "The artist should be an actor who refuses to act"'137 and "Immobility and inertia are what many of the most gifted artists prefer."'138 In 1970, when asked, "What is your position regarding the kinds of political action that should be taken by artists?" Smithson answered, "My 'position' is one of sinking into an awareness of global squalor and futility."139 The quotes Smithson places around the word "position" are typical of his broader suspicion of linear perspective, of single "points of view." When pressed as to his political positions, at least in his published interviews, Smithson's usual tactic was to attack the notion of "positionality" itself. His "position" was, as he put it, "basically a pointless position.... I think the more points the better, you know, just an endless amount of points of view. "140 Smithson's expedition to Yucatin can be understood as an exploration and performance of precisely this "position." Seeking to sink into a form of dissolution, a low-level, crystallizing perception that cannot gather itself into a single viewpoint, Smithson found a model in the indifferent land- scape of Yucatan. "Incidents of Mirror-Travel in the Yucatan" functions as a primer of indifferent perception and political passivity. The landscape and the population of Yucatan as Smithson and his contemporaries constructed them-- inscrutable, impassive, indifferent-exemplify the "invincible idleness" that Smithson considered to be the only viable political strategy. For all his inversions of Stephens's narrative, Smithson perpetuates, even amplifies, Stephens's belief in Yucatecan amnesia, indifference, and myopia. And although he hopes to inhabit this status instead of performing corrective surgery on it, his work maintains much of Stephens's imperialist vio- lence. Both Smithson and Stephens picture the Yucatdn Peninsula as indifferent in order to extract from it a heritage. For Stephens, the contemporary idleness of the Maya autho- rizes his appropriation of the region's archaeological artifacts. For Smithson, the idleness, now seen as eternal, is itself the artifact. It provides a primordial endorsement for passivism and a heritage, a "fundamental memory," of indifference. Jennifer L. Roberts is the Carole and Alvin I.

Notes This essay is derived from a chapter of my doctoral dissertation ("Mirrored Travels: Robert Smithson and History," Yale University, 2000). An earlier version of the argument was presented at the open session on American art at the College Art Association meeting of February 1998 in Toronto; my thanks to the session chairs William H. Truettner and Doreen Bolger for giving me the opportunity to make an initial presentation of this material. As the text has developed over the past two years, I have been fortunate to have many readers offer insights, suggestions, and debate: Jules D. Prown, Johanna Drucker, Bryan J. Wolf, Thomas Crow, Christopher S. Wood, Alexander Nemerov, Katherine Manthorne, Kristin Schwain, Wendy Bellion, Anne Collins, Rocio Aranda-Alvarado, and the anonymous Art Bulletin readers. I owe particular gratitude to Caroline A. Jones for her especially attentive reading and to Mary Miller and R. Tripp Evans, without whose patient and generous guidance in some of the most basic aspects of pre-Columbian studies I could not have undertaken this foray into an unfamiliar subject. Nancy Holt has been exceedingly helpful throughout, making photographs available and graciously submitting to an interview. My research on this topic has been supported by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the Henry Luce Foundation/American Council of Learned Societies, and the National Museum of American Art/Smithsonian Institution. 1. Writings, 47. 2.

Of all of Smithson's major traveling projects, the Yucatin expedition has received the least scholarly attention to date. The existing discussions of the Yucatin project are generally so brief that they mention Stephens only quickly, if at all, as an uncomplicated object of Smithson's various parodic-allegorical inversions. One welcome exception is a chapter in a recent doctoral disserta- tion (of which I did not become aware until this manuscript had been completed): Rebecca Ann Butterfield, "The Displacement of History: Robert Smithson's Time Travel in the Yucatan," in "Colonizing the Past: Archaic References and the Archaeological Paradigm in Contemporary American Earth Art," Ph.D. diss., University of Pennsylvania, 1998, 14-83. Butterfield's chapter includes several pages of comparative discussion of the two travelers. Butterfield and I have reached some similar conclusions about Smithson's simultaneous rejection and perpetuation of Stephens's precedent, as we have about some of Smithson's ahistorical leanings, but our discussions engage different themes and thus complement each other as sustained examinations of Smithson's YucatAn project. Butterfield's chapter focuses on Smithson's employment of archaeological motifs and strategies (burial, fieldwork, and so on), while mine concentrates on the complex of blindness, amnesia, and indifference that each traveler predicates on the landscape and its inhabitants. Other than Butterfield's chapter, the only text that devotes itself exclusively to Smithson's Yucatin project is Marjorie Perloff, "The Demise of 'And': Reflections on Robert Smithson's Mirrors," Critical Quarterly 32, no. 3 (1990): 81-101. Short discussions of the project in longer works include Gary Shapiro, Earthwards: Robert Smithson and Art after Babel (Berkeley: University of Califor- nia Press, 1996), 98-104; Henry Sayre, Object of Performance: The American Avant-Garde since 1970 (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1989), 222-26; Robert Hobbs, Robert Smithson Sculpture (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1981), 151-65; and Ronald Graziani, "(De)terminating the Political Enframe- ment in the Art by Robert Smithson," Ph.D. diss., University of California, Los Angeles, 1992, 139-43. 5.

The founding texts interpreting Smithson's work as a displacement of modernism were written by Craig Owens in the late 1970s and early 1980s: "Earthwords," 40-51, and "The Allegorical Impulse: Toward a Theory of Postmodernism," 52-87, in Beyond Recognition: Representation, Power, and Culture (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1992). Other key texts in this vein include Shapiro (as in n. 4); Ann M. Reynolds, "Robert Smithson: Learning from NewJersey and Elsewhere," Ph.D. diss., City University of New York, 1993; Caroline A. Jones, "Post-Studio/Postmodern: Robert Smithson and the Technological Sublime," in The Machine in the Studio: Constructing the Postwar American Artist (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996), 268-343; Jessica Prinz, "Words en Abime: Smithson's Labyrinth of Signs," in Art Discourse/Discourse in Art (New Brunswick, N.J.: Rutgers University Press, 1991), 79-123; and Perloff (as in n. 4). Exceptions to this postmodern approach include Ron Graziani, who has explored Smithson's work within the historical context of picturesque aesthetics: "Robert Smithson's Picturable Situation: Blasted Landscapes from the 1960s," Critical Inquiry 20 (Spring 1994): 419-51. Graziani's dissertation (as in n. 4) provides a good analysis of the critical response to Smithson's work since his death in 1973. 8.

Van Wyck Brooks, in his World of Washington Irving (New York: Dutton, 1944), 491-99, discusses Stephens's reputation in New York and his influence among the literati. Melville, in Redburn, wrote about his own boyhood awe of Stephens, and Poe was closely involved with Stephens's work, having published reviews of three of his four travel books. The hieroglyphics that appear on the fictional island of Tsalal in Poe's Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym, for example, were inspired by the glyphs Stephens found at Sinai. Poe's glyphs, in a circular coincidence of which Smithson was probably not aware, then went on to inspire Smithson's work (see Smithson's reference to Tsalal in "A Sedimenta- tion of the Mind: Earth Projects," in Writings, 108). For Poe's reviews of Stephens, see review of Incidents of Travel in Egypt, Arabia Petraea, and the Holy Land, New York Review 1 (Oct. 1837): 351-67; review of Incidents of Travel in Greece, Turkey, Russia and Poland, New York Review 3 (Oct. 1838): 460-63; review of Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas, and Yucatdin, Graham's Magazine 19 (Aug. 1841): 94. 10. The two publications are Stephens, 1841, and Stephens, 1843. During the first expedition (1839-40) Stephens explored sites in the southern and western areas of Maya influence. The second expedition (1841-42) was restricted to the northern part of the peninsula. Since the second trip was conceived as an extension of the first (which had been cut short by malaria), I will be treating them as a single expedition for the purposes of this discussion. 11. Catherwood also published his own folio edition of twenty-five litho- graphs: Views of Ancient Monuments in Central America, Chiapas and Yucatdn (London, 1844). The images and text of Views have been reprinted (if poorly) in Victor Wolfgang Von Hagen, Frederick Catherwood Architect (New York: Oxford University Press, 1950). 12. For a good summary of the issues and personalities involved in "rediscovery" in this period, see Michael Coe, Breaking the Maya Code (New York: Thames and Hudson, 1992), 73-98. 13.

I will make only limited attempts in this article to interrogate the "true" condition of the indigenous figures that Stephens and Smithson represented in their narratives. This is not only because postcolonial scholars have rightly argued that to speak for the Other, even in an attempt to overturn colonialist thought, is to perpetuate colonialist structures of authority. It is also because no single, uncomplicated Other exists to be gleaned from either travelers' narrative. Both Stephens and Smithson comment primarily on an "Indian" or "Maya" population, but the impreci- sion of their labels cannot encompass the spectrum of cultures existing within the category of "Maya," not to mention the broad range of national, religious, and ethnic populations, complicated by centuries of creolization, that each traveler would also have encountered. My goal is not, then, to correct the distortions visited on the landscape and its inhabitants by Stephens and Smithson but merely to analyze the mechanisms and motivations producing those distortions. I do not attempt to determine whether or not the Maya were truly "indifferent" but rather discuss the factors that made Stephens and Smithson perceive "indifference" in them and invest that indifference with meaning. 20. R. Tripp Evans has discussed this detachment more extensively in "Classical Frontiers: New World Antiquities in the American Imagination, 1820-1915," Ph.D. diss., Yale University, 1998, 60-82. See also Curtis Hinsley, "Hemispheric Hegemony in Early American Anthropology, 1841-1851: Reflec- tions on John Lloyd Stephens and Henry Lewis Morgan," Proceedings of the American Ethnological Society, 1985: 28-40. Although Hinsley does not discuss Catherwood's drawings, he focuses on Stephens's "imaginative detachment of the ruins from a population of degraded villages and marauding soldiers" (31) with particular sensitivity to the effects of the Central American civil war that was brewing around Stephens throughout the first expedition. 21. In analyzing the figures in Catherwood's images it is useful to compare them with their equivalents in Giambattista Piranesi's 18th-century views of Roman ruins, which Catherwood had encountered in Sir John Soane's architecture courses at the Royal Academy in the 1820s and which became the strongest influence on his own architectural illustrations; see Von Hagen, 1950 (as in n. 11), 12. Despite Catherwood's stylistic debt to Piranesi, the picturesque lollygagging of his indigenous figures marks a telling departure from the active, curious demeanor of their Roman precedents. 22.

The temporal disjunction thus established, between Stephens's histori- cal time and the Indians' timelessness, has been shown to be typical of anthropological narrative.Johannes Fabian, who calls this strategy the "denial of coevalness," has discussed it at length in his indispensable critique of the uses of time in anthropological discourse, Time and the Other: How Anthropology Makes Its Object (New York: Columbia University Press, 1983). The entire book takes the denial of coevalness as its theme; a concise discussion of the term can be found on 31. Although I am focusing here on Stephens's representation of indigenous culture, it should be noted that Stephens also "denies coevalness" to the Americans of Spanish extraction that he finds in Yucatin. He represents even the highest social castes as stunted dead ends of modern European progress, as if they were preserved specimens of Old Europe, trapped in the amber of Central American ahistory: "The countries in America subject to the Spanish dominion have felt less sensibly, perhaps, than any others in the world, the onward impulse of the last two centuries, and in them many usages and customs derived from Europe, there long since fallen into oblivion, are still in full force"; Stephens, 1843, vol. 1, 111. 27.

Albert, introduction to Three Treatises on Strabismus (Birmingham, Ala.: Gryphon Editions, Classics of Ophthalmology Library, 1987).

Stephens, 1843, vol. 1, 64. Ironically, although Cabot made sure that the eyes of his subjects were physically aligned, his operations alone would not likely have improved the patients' vision. Even today, the surgery must be followed by an extensive program of visual training to ensure that the once "lazy" eye learns to work in concert with the functional eye. Postsurgical care not being among the priorities of their expedition, however, Stephens, Catherwood, and Cabot left town the day after the operations. It does not seem too far-fetched to say that these eye operations were worth more to the establishment of ethnohistorical hierarchies in Stephens's narrative than they were to the visual health of the patients. 32.

For example, Jean Frederic Waldeck, a naturalized French citizen who had visited Uxmal and had lived among the ruins of Palenque, was convinced that the ancient builders were "Hindoos," and went so far as to include elephants in his lithographs of the sculptural reliefs at Palenque.

This doctrine of inevitability allowed Stephens to pursue the cultural conquest of the Maya without disturbing his conscience; it was a strategy similarly employed to gloss over the indignities inflicted on Native Americans during the westward expansion of the United States. 44.

Stephens bemoans the loss of artifacts in Stephens, 1843, vol. 1, 103: "their loss cannot be replaced; for, being first on the ground, and having all at my choice, I of course selected only those objects which were most curious and valuable; and if I were to go over the whole ground again, I could not find others equal to them." 48. The Cole painting in question was Moonlight, 1833-34.

The three had been planning the trip for at least a year previously. A postcard to the Smithsons from Virginia Dwan, postmarked Feb. 20, 1968, from Mexico, reads in part: "Met some people here who had explored Mayan area, so have some ideas for our trip.-should plan it for no later than April (mid.)

By combining the information in Smithson's article with Virginia Dwan's later recollections, it is possible to reconstruct a rough outline of Smithson's travels through the area. On their journey from New York, Smithson, Holt, and Dwan stopped first in Florida, visiting Sanibel Island and then spending a day with Robert Rauschenberg at his home on nearby Captiva Island. They then flew from Florida to Merida, near the north coast of the Yucatdn Peninsula (where Stephens, Catherwood, and Cabot had performed their strabismus surgeries 128 years earlier). From there they drove south past Uxmal, then west to Campeche, then southwest to Palenque. They took a plane east from there to Bonampak, and then another farther east to the Usumacinta River, where they embarked on a downstream dugout trip, returning upstream again after reaching Yaxchilin. Then they looped through Villahermosa, Frontera, Ciudad del Carmen, and the aptly named Laguna de Terminos, where the "Incidents," at least so far as they were recorded in Smithson's article, ended.

The activity of turning over rocks proposes not only the futility but also the aimlessness of archaeological inquiry. Jean- Jacques Rousseau, after all, included this activity in his inventory of indolent exploits: "I love to occupy myself by doing trifles ... following a fly in all its flying about, wanting to uproot a rock to see what is under it ... ."; Rousseau, Confessions, XII, in The Confessions and Correspondence, trans.

Smithson frequently acknowledged Ehrenzweig as an influence on his conception of "primary process"-his "low-level" working method of seeing and experienc- ing the sites to which he traveled. Ehrenzweig's influence is particularly apparent in Smithson's essay "A Sedimentation of the Mind: Earth Projects," in Writings, 100-113. For Smithson's discussions of Ehrenzweig, see esp. 102-3.

In his attempts to apply a philosophy of inaction to his landscape work, Smithson was well aware of the discourse of the pastoral. Although it might be argued that his work is anathema to the pastoral, he adopted many of its traditional aspects, not least its emphasis on passivity. To cite a passage that he underlined in one of his books, "The contemplator looks upon the world and man with the calm eye of one who has no design on them" (in Sebastian de Grazia, Of Time, Work, and Leisure [New York: Twentieth Century Fund, 1962], 17; Smithson's annotated copy, Smithson Papers). But Smithson takes this "calm eye" of contemplation several steps further, from calmness to exhaus- tion. 83. Smithson, 1969a, 133. 84. Ibid., 127, 124. In regard to this heavy or groggy light, the word "incidents" in his title is significant. The English word incident derives from the Latin incidere, "to fall upon," hence, "Falling or striking upon or against; acting upon anything from without" (Oxford English Dictionary, 2d ed., s.v. "incident"). The terms incident light and incident ray refer to light as it falls on a surface, as opposed to light that emanates from or passes through it. Smithson was well aware of this etymology; he pointed out in an interview soon after his YucatAn trip that "incident itself means falling" (Smithson, 1969b, 215). Smithson's incident light is fallen light: "Reflections fall onto the mirrors without logic" (Smithson, 1969a, 124). 85. Smithson, 1969a, 133. 86. Ibid., 127. 87. Ibid., 125. 88.

For Beckett's main discussion of involuntary memory, see 17-21. There are other references to Beckett's book in Smith- son's Yucatin essay (Smithson, 1969a), notably 127, where Smithson's phrases "The Caretaker of Dullness-habit-lurks everywhere" and "the futile and stupefying mazes" are both near-transcriptions of text that Smithson had underlined in Beckett's book. He also refers to "futile and stupefying habits" in his essay "An Aesthetics of Disappointment," in Writings, 334-35, and cites Beckett's book in "Quasi-Infinities" (as in n. 88), 37. 92. This distinction dates back to Aristotle, who had distinguished in his Of Memory and Reminiscence between remembering, which he classified as some- thing that simply besets the lethargic and dull-witted, and recollection or reminiscence, which he privileged as active and productive. See Richard Sorabji, Aristotle on Memory (London: Duckworth, 1972), 47; and David Farrell Krell, Of Memory, Reminiscence, and Writing (Bloomington, Ind.: Indiana University Press, 1990), 13-19. 93.

Writings, 65, 63. The "Ultra" in "Ultramoderne" is a reference to the Ultraists, a group of Spanish and Spanish-American writers (including Jorge Luis Borges) active in the 1920s and 1930s. Although Smithson did not seem to have absorbed the specific sociopolitical overtones of the Ultraists' work, he drew from them a conviction that the accumulation or projection of multiple, conflicting histories would be the best way to displace the hegemonic history of the modernists. Thus, in the "Ultramoderne" essay he writes (63), that "the Ultraist does not reject the archaic multi-cycles of the infinite. He does not 'make' history in order to impress those who believe in one history." 98.J. G. Ballard, The Crystal World (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1966), 73. 99. Ibid., 94-95. 100.
