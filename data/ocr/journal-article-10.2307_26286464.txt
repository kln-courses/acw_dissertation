<plain_text><page sequence="1">La Peste: Infected by the Bacillus of Self-Consciousness Steven G. Kellman THOUGH WHITE IS A BLEND OF ALL COLORS and white noise is an amalgam of every sound, a veritably Bakhtinian em bodiment of the polyvocal, what Roland Barthes dubbed l'écriture blanche is a literature of absence. In this neutral, innocent degré zéro de l'écriture, contends Barthes, "la problématique humaine est découverte et livrée sans couleur.'" Barthes credits L'Etranger with inaugurating this literary achromatism. In Camus's first published novel, he found a definitive transparency, "un style de l'absence qui est presque une absence idéale du style" (ibid., p. 109). Among the irritable appur tenances of style abjured by L'Etranger in Barthes's reading of it are linguistic opacity and narrative self-consciousness. Meursault's story is told with the illusory immediacy that makes us forget the agency of words and the context of storytelling. Barthes was doubtless indulging in heuristics when he seized on L'Etranger as the paradigm of neutral prose. But there is surely a para dox in cataloguing a book whose central actions are a murder and a capital conviction as a prototype of "innocence." The novel's two-part structure as a representation of the hermeneutic experience—in which the reader is first presented with a record of apparently random events and then, during the trial, asked to reorganize and interpret those events pushes Camus's prose several degrees above zero. "The result," declares Brian T. Fitch, "is a text wherein the reader reads the story of his own activity. The experience provided by L'Etranger is paradoxically that of its own reading."2 If so, Le Degré zéro de l'écriture would seem a purer case of innocence than would L'Etranger. Schiller might well have judged Camus—not quite the Algerian primitive that Left Bank intellec tuals thought they were patronizing—more sentimentalisch than naïve. Though Fitch's book The Narcissistic Text provides abundant docu mentation of inter- and intratextuality throughout the Camus canon, the laureate of the limpid light of North Africa is rarely invoked in discus sions of metafiction. His moral earnestness and his sober prose (Is white the antithesis of purple?) make Camus seem as distant from Borges, Calvino, and Joyce as he was uncomfortable in the bookish cénacle of 22 Summer 1991</page><page sequence="2">Kellman Sartre and Beauvoir. Instinctually repelled by artistic flamboyance, Camus championed an aesthetic of literary asceticism in which the author renounces the temptations of embellishment and ego. "La grande règle de l'artiste," he wrote in "L'Intelligence et l'échafaud" in 1943, "est de s'oublier à moitié au profit d'une expression communicable."3 He aspired to an ideal of classicism that eschewed originality; "Etre classique, c'est se répéter," proclaimed the publicist of Sisyphus (ibid., p. 1898). And yet he also recognized that consciousness of the repetition was fundamental to achieving classical lucidity: "Etre classique, c'est en même temps se répéter et savoir se répéter" (ibid.). La Peste, over which Camus struggled for seven years, while he also wrote "L'Intelligence et l'échafaud," is usually discussed thematically, as direct witness to the virtue of resistance and rebellion against a "claustrophobic world of war, prison, concentration camp, and tor ture," in Germaine Brée's phrase.4 In his famous January 11, 1955 letter to Roland Barthes, Camus himself denied that the novel is anti-historical and encouraged critics to read it as a transparent allegory of resistance to the Nazi occupation. Though Fitch, who analyzes La Peste in a chapter he calls "The Autoreferential Text," counts 170 references to texts within the text of Camus's translucent novel (Fitch, p. 15), few other critics have noted how thoroughly metafictional is this fiction about a plague in Oran. La Peste begins with an epigraph from the preface to volume 3 of Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, one that—beyond the general effect of all epigraphs in alerting readers to the kinship of what they are about to read with other works of literature—foregrounds the factitiousness of the words to come: "Il est aussi raisonnable de repré senter une espèce d'emprisonnement par une autre que de représenter n'importe quelle chose qui existe réellement par quelque chose qui n existe pas (1217). The book concludes with the lonely figure of Dr. Bernard Rieux observing and in effect reading the signals sent by the throngs celebrating their victory over the epidemic, "les cris d'allégresse qui montaient de la ville." But he offers an alternative hermeneutics of the situation, one that the crowds would adopt if only they were wiser readers—"Car il savait ce que cette foule en joie ignorait, et qu'on peut lire dans les livres, que le bacille de la peste ne meurt ni ne disparaît jamais. . ." (1474). La Peste is, from its first page to its last, a supremely self-conscious fiction, but what distinguishes it from many of the other metatexts that have metastasized throughout the body of twentieth century literature is its troubled conscience about its own reflexivity. It Vol. XXXI, No. 2 23</page><page sequence="3">L'Esprit Créateur longs for a narrative innocence that is sullied by that very longing. "Certainement, l'activité romanesque suppose une sorte de refus du réel," wrote Camus in L'Homme révolté,6 three years after suppressing the designation roman from La Peste in 1948. The narrator of his plague book is obsessed with convincing us that he has neither invented nor embroidered anything. Rieux insists that he is no romancier, but rather "l'historien des cœurs déchirés et exigeants que la peste fit alors à nos concitoyens" (1326-27) and "un témoin fidèle" (1468). He presents himself as a faithful chronicler with the circumscribed mandate of merely recording events: "Sa tâche est seulement de dire: 'Ceci est arrivé', lorsqu'il sait que ceci est, en effet, arrivé, que ceci a intéressé la vie de tout un peuple, et qu'il y a donc des milliers de témoins qui estimeront dans leur cœur la vérité de ce qu'il dit" (1221). To dispel any suspicion of fabrication, Rieux scrupulously identifies his sources, noting that they fall into three categories: "son témoignage d'abord, celui des autres ensuite, puisque, par son rôle, il fut amené à recueillir les confidences de tous les personnages de cette chronique, et en dernier lieu, les textes qui finirent par tomber entre ses mains" (1222). In his definition of l'écriture blanche, Barthes links it to journalism: "il serait juste de dire que c'est une écriture de journaliste, si précisément le journalisme ne développait en général des formes optatives ou impéra tives (c'est-à-dire pathétiques)" (op. cit., p. 109). La Peste happens to number within its cast a journalist: Raymond Rambert, a Parisian who has been sent to Oran to report on living conditions among the Arabs. But, at least before Rambert renounces his private passions by abandon ing plans to steal back to his lover in Paris and joining the communal effort to combat the plague, Rieux is suspicious of his dedication to the journalistic ideal of self-effacement. When, during their first encounter, Rambert appeals to Rieux for assistance in making his report, the doctor refuses, sensing that the journalist will not write the full truth. "Je n'admets que les témoignages sans réserves," proclaims Rieux, to which Rambert replies: "C'est le langage de Saint-Just" (1226). But it is just that kind of plain language, shorn of any artfulness, that Rieux aspires to in writing his chronicle. It is through contrast to "literature," the odious histrionics of a stage play, that he explains the character of the account he writes: "celui d'une relation faite avec de bons sentiments, c'est-à-dire des sentiments qui ne sont ni ostensiblement mauvais ni exaltants à la vilaine façon d'un spectacle" (1331). Rieux begins his report by noting the ordinariness and banality of Oran, "un lieu neutre pour tout dire" 24 Summer 1991</page><page sequence="4">Kellman (1219), as though the Algerian setting were a geographical analogue of the journalistic zero degree to which he would reduce all discourse. Under the pressures of a plague, anything but the terseness of the tele grams with which Oranians communicate to those outside the quarantine lines seems irresponsibly self-indulgent. As though insignificance and effacement were criteria for heroism, Rieux nominates the modest municipal clerk Joseph Grand as hero of his story, "ce héros insignifiant et effacé" (1331). The drolly named Grand is perhaps the most obvious device by which La Peste foregrounds its own articulate anxiety over eloquence. A portrait of the artist as Flau bertian fanatic, Grand dreams of writing the consummate book that will proclaim his genius and cause an awestruck publisher to exclaim: "Chapeaux bas!" Grand is so obsessed with fashioning le mot juste that he finds it impossible to get beyond a single sentence, filling fifty pages with elaborate variations on: "Par une belle matinée du mois de mai, une élégante amazone parcourait, sur une superbe jument alezane, les allées fleuries du Bois de Boulogne" (1304). Rieux, who disingenuously describes himself as "peu averti des usages de la littérature" (1303), is initially more attracted to Grand's selfless devotion to his task than to his florid prose. However, a near-fatal bout with the plague causes Grand to scrap his sentence and begin again, in an austere style more worthy of Rieux's admiration. The final words ascribed to Grand in Rieux's spare narrative concern the latest version of his sentence: "J'ai supprimé, dit il, tous les adjectifs" (1472). Adjectives are arguably the most idiosyn cratic parts of speech. In moving from a highly ornate, distinctive sen tence that could have come from A l'ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs to an unadorned statement of fact, Grand is suppressing what is most dis tinctive in his style. He has, as Verlaine advises, taken eloquence and wrung its neck. Grand is renouncing personality, which is what Rieux comes to feel is a luxury that can only isolate an individual from the com munity. It has no place during the exigencies of plague. Against the ascetic mission of the witness, aesthetic virtuosity is frivolous and divisive, suggests Camus with sly virtuosity. The official quarantine strands an opera company in Oran. Every Friday, month after month, they mount the same production of Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice. On the evening that Tarrou and Cottard happen to attend the opera, the performance halts in the midst of the climactic duet between Orpheus and Eurydice, on account of the fact that the singer playing Orpheus drops dead of plague on the stage. It is a stunning, and VOL. XXXI, No. 2 25</page><page sequence="5">L'Esprit Créateur artful, demonstration by a novel of the impotence of art. If Orpheus himself, the archetypal artist endowed with a musical gift that can over come even the terrors of Hades, is vulnerable to pestilence, the author as Romantic prodigy is at best an Orphic liar. Plain song is the best song is Camus's cunning refrain. For Jean Tarrou, the diarist who, like the writers Rambert, Grand, and Rieux, foregrounds the textuality of La Peste itself, convoluted, tur bid prose—the antithesis of l'écriture blanche—is an ethical as well as aesthetic affront: "le malheur des hommes venait de ce qu'ils ne tenaient pas un langage clair" (1426), declares the man who, paring away the mystique of the supernatural, aspires to be "un saint sans Dieu" (1427). Tarrou's journal entries are themselves remarkably spare, yet Rieux finds them baffling. He cannot detect any method to the minute but odd observations that fill Tarrou's notebooks: "il s'agit d'une chronique très particulière qui semble obéir à un parti pris d'insignifiance" (1236). He is perplexed by the precise but seemingly random descriptions of two bronze lions in front of city hall, the streetcars of Oran, and the snatches of conversations overheard among strangers in what he terms Tarrou's "écart de langage ou de pensée" (1238). Of all the passages in Camus's writings, Tarrou's diary entries, in their willingness to present, without imposing a system of signification, a universe of contingent objects, come closest in spirit to le nouveau roman of Alain Robbe-Grillet. "A première vue," notes Rieux, "on pourrait croire que Tarrou s'est ingénié à considérer les choses et les êtres par le gros bout de la lorgnette. Dans le désarroi général, il s'appliquait, en somme, à se faire l'historien de ce qui n'a pas d'histoire" (1236). In its refusal to impose human interpreta tion, Tarrou's self-effacing prose comes closest to the non-anthropo centric chosisme that Robbe-Grillet would proclaim a decade after La Peste. It approaches the ideal that Rieux himself suggests for the writer in a time of plague. Referring disdainfully to the Oranians as "human istes: ils ne croyaient pas aux fléaux," Rieux reminds us that: "Le fléau n'est pas à la mesure de l'homme" (1247). The implication seems to be that the only honest writing is that which foregoes the temptations of humanistic interpretation. La Peste, with its aspirations toward allegory, remains a humanistic text. Its concluding caveat—that the plague bacillus is merely dormant, that some day, "pour le malheur et l'enseignement des hommes" (1474) it will spread again—affirms that both la peste and La Peste are designed to be didactic. However, what both the plague and the book about it 26 Summer 1991</page><page sequence="6">Kellman teach us seems to be a degree of humility that approaches the zero degree of writing. This is evident in another set of internal texts that the novel employs to dramatize its own designs. The two sermons that Father Paneloux delivers—strategically and symmetrically positioned in sections II and IV, respectively, of the five-part book—move from the affirma tion of a coherent system of transgression and retribution to a renuncia tion of anthropomorphic language. Paneloux's first sermon confidently posits an intelligible universe in which God employs the plague as an instrument of punishment, education, and salvation: "Ce fléau même qui vous meurtrit, il vous élève et vous montre la voie" (1299). However, the experience of witnessing the excruciating and unmerited death of Othon's young son subverts Paneloux's glib attempt at theodicy. The priest's second sermon abandons any attempt at ascribing moral mean ing to the epidemic. Faced with the suffering of innocents, Paneloux in effect embraces Tertullian's credo quia absurdum est, proclaiming his submission to God's love precisely because it is irreducible to human terms: "II suppose l'abandon total de soi-même et le dédain de sa per sonne. Mais lui seul peut effacer la souffrance et la mort des enfants, lui seul en tout cas la rendre nécessaire, parce qu'il est impossible de la com prendre et qu'on ne peut que la vouloir" (1405). This ideal of self-effacement, endorsed by Paneloux, is enacted by each of the other characters who generate texts within La Peste. How ever, the paragon of renunciation, the figure most admired in Tarrou's diary, is one of the few characters in the novel who is not writing or orat ing anything: Rieux's mother. Summarizing Tarrou's comments about his own mother, the doctor notes: "Tarrou insistait surtout sur l'efface ment de Mme Rieux; sur la façon qu'elle avait de tout exprimer en phrases simples" (1446). In fact, the phrases are so simple that what is most striking about Mme Rieux is her propensity for silence. She tran scends words into a primal innocence that Tarrou identifies with truth and that Grand, Paneloux, and Rambert, as well, prefer to the verbosity that each tries to erase and at least succeeds in reducing. "C'est au moment du malheur," claims Tarrou, "qu'on s'habitue à la vérité, c'est à-dire au silence" (1314). And yet, though truth is mute, it is only through words that he can communicate the superiority of silence. Words are also the intractable medium that Rieux must resort to in his determination to bear witness. The most striking technical feature of his account, which is in fact the novel we read, is its attempt to camou flage the identity of its narrator. It is less than seven pages from the end VOL. XXXI, NO. 2 27</page><page sequence="7">L'Esprit Créateur that Bernard Rieux finally comes forward and identifies himself as the chronicler. He has otherwise been scrupulous in suppressing the idiosyn crasies of the self by presenting an impartial report in which everyone, Rieux included, is referred to in the third person. However, "je" breaks through the mask of "il" in the final, poig nant scene of communal celebration over the lifting of the quarantine. The plague has subsided, and lovers, separated during the many months in which the gates of Oran have been closed, are at last reunited. Early in La Peste, the narrator, who finds particular interest in the plight of Rambert, separated from his lover in Paris, and of Grand, estranged from a wife, Jeanne, who has moved out of Oran, justifies his extensive attention to the situation of separated couples—"qui sont les plus intéres sants et dont le narrateur est peut-être mieux placé pour parler" (1279). They are most interesting at least to the narrator because, as we discover, Rieux is one of them. Shortly before the outbreak of the epidemic, his wife leaves Oran for a sanatorium elsewhere. The quarantine keeps Rieux from seeing her again, and, when it is lifted, it is too late, because she has already died. At the end of La Peste, Rieux is a solitary, woeful figure, standing alone on his balcony and observing the joyful crowds in the streets below. Aware that he will never be reunited with his beloved, Rieux determines to memorialize the collective experience of Oran during the plague by writing an account of it. To read that account, we of course must turn back to the first page of La Peste, which is thus a self-begetting novel, a fiction that not only lays bare its own devices but that recounts the story of its genesis. In a decon struction of the work, Richard-Laurent Barnett contends that: ... in La Peste, textuality is not engendered, nor tacitly proliferated, but rather retracted, devolved, annihilated, sustained by an inveterate, degenerative process of subtraction, a never desisting passage toward nothingness. Language and all that it is ostensibly harnessed to represent tamper with absence, until they are ultimately subsumed by it, at which point the disintegrated text is but vestige, an auto-reflexive allusion to—and meta-commentary upon—its deconstructed, disembodied self.7 In its aspiration toward submerging the discrete "je" in the collective "nous" and toward replacing rhetoric with silence, La Peste is certainly a self-destructing text. However, like the Beckett trilogy, it is a construc tive destruction, and a destructive construction. To overcome the solitude in which he is trapped at the conclusion of the plague, Rieux devises a strategy to reintegrate himself into the com 28 Summer 1991</page><page sequence="8">Kellman munity, to reenact Paneloux's progress from his first sermon, when he plays the part of the self-righteous preacher glaring down at a congrega tion he addresses as "vous," to his second, when he concedes his kinship by using the pronoun "nous." The chronicle that Rieux intends to write as a means of overcoming his isolation will be a triumph of effacement, of the self and of the text. Using the phrase "nos concitoyens" as an obsessive refrain, it will attempt to convince the reader that Rieux is in no way anomalous, that the narrator is justified in including the doctor in the story, "puisque, avec des nuances, sa réaction fut celle de la plupart de nos concitoyens" (1247). Details of Rieux's personal tribulations, contends the hidden chronicler, are synecdoche not swagger—"Et le nar rateur est persuadé qu'il peut écrire ici, au nom de tous, ce que lui-même a éprouvé alors, puisqu'il l'a éprouvé en même temps que beaucoup de nos concitoyens" (1276). However, the more Rieux insists on his inseparability from the communal narrative the more he emphasizes his estrangement. La Peste is a perpetual mise-en-abîme in which, at each successive reading, an isolate "je" extrudes from the "nous." For all the restraints imposed on its style, it never fully whitewashes the iridescence of its écriture. Self-conscious about the banefulness of self and con sciousness, it clamors for silence.
