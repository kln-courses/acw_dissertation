<plain_text> <page sequence="1">      Actions Speak Louder than Words: Close Relationships between Humans and Nonhuman Animals Clinton R. Sanders University of Connecticut Symbolic interactionism and other sociological perspectives traditionally have not attended to a significant form of close relationship—that which exists between people and the companion animals with whom they share their everyday lives. After a brief presentation of a portion of the relevant literature that deals with how humans understand and interact with their animal companions, I present the process by which caretakers come to define the unique identities of their animals and the ways in which the human-animal couple identity shapes public interaction. Since play, mutual gaze, and “speaking for” animals are key elements of friendly human-animal interaction, I discuss these activities as central to the process by which caretakers establish and express intersubjective connections with their ani- mals. Finally, I maintain that attention to human-animal relationships holds promise for advancing an appreciative understanding of how personhood, mind, and culture are constructed in the process of interaction. Of special significance to the broadening of the interactionist perspective is that the understandings and emotional connections that bind people and their ani- mals are created and maintained in the absence of a shared body of lin- guistic symbols. Relationships, which are composed of routine and patterned interactions, are cen- tral to the symbolic interactionist view of social life. Relationships range from those that are instrumental, emotionally uninvolving, and typically of short duration to those that are intrinsically rewarding and long-term and in which participants have considerable emotional stake. Conventionally, interactionists and other analysts of social life have seen the interdependence, commitment, and emotionality of close relationships as existing within, and sustained by, the symbolic exchanges of hu- mans. I maintain that this characterization of close relationships is overly restrictive. It excludes from consideration a class of affiliations that are commonplace,1 imbued Direct all correspondence to Clinton R.

Traditionally, conventional sociologists (e.g., Perrow 2000:473) have ignored or denigrated relationships between people and their companion animals. How- ever, the intense, involving, and routine interactions forming these relations are worthy of serious attention and have the potential of adding significantly to the so- ciology of intimate exchanges. Until fairly recently, sociologists have disregarded human-animal relationships.2 Constrained by what Rollin (1997) calls the “commonsense of science,” sociology routinely has portrayed nonhuman animals as mindless, emotionless, self-less, react- ing rather than acting, apprehending rather than comprehending, and existing only in the immediately situation.3 It has defined people’s associations with them as “fic- tive” or the consequence of anthropomorphic “folk delusions.” This dismissal is based largely on the linguicentric Cartesian assumption that, lacking the ability to use symbols, nonhuman animals are qualitatively distinct from humans. George Herbert Mead (1907, 1962) frequently used examples of non- human animals as a backdrop to his discussion of the (supposedly) unique abilities of humans to construct meaning; to engage in minded behavior; and to create, re- flect on, and present the self. Lacking the basic resource of symbolization, animals could not think or engage in the complex form of social interaction premised on shared symbols. The animal does not think. . . . In order that thought may exist there must be symbols, vocal gestures generally, which arouse in the individual himself the re- sponse which he is calling out in the other, and such that from the point of view of that response he is able to direct his later conduct. (Mead 1962:73) Following Mead’s lead, symbolic interactionists and other sociologists consistently have excluded animals from serious consideration, since, “not being human, [they] can in no way be social or cultural beings as this would be a contradiction in terms” (Noske 1989:82–83). In the following discussion, I reexamine close relationships to move beyond the limiting anthropocentric orthodoxy that presents the bonds and interactions be- tween humans and nonhuman animals as qualitatively different from—and, by im- plication, inferior to—those between humans. Following a brief overview of the key discussions of human-animal relationships that exist, I examine the relevance of this type of social exchange for identity. Here I present the central issue of how people come to ascertain the unique identities of their companion animals while in- teracting with them. I also emphasize how a close relationship with a companion animal shapes the human caretaker’s identity both as an individual and as a member of the human-animal “couple.” Next, I turn to examine the close relationship with a companion animal as a form of friendship. Like human-to-human friendships, those between people and com- panion animals assume intersubjectivity. Play, as I argue, requires participants to evaluate the situation, define the perspective of the other, and—in the context of </page> <page sequence="3">    Actions Speak Louder than Words 407 mutually understood rules—make decisions about how to act in concert. In addi- tion, I discuss gaze and mutual direction of attention as central elements of the inter- subjectivity that supports interspecies friendship. This section on human-animal friendship concludes with a brief presentation of a typical feature of the relation- ship. Caretakers commonly give voice to what they understand to be the thoughts and feelings of their animal companions. This process of “speaking for” demon- strates the practical definition of the (animal) other that arises out of routine rela- tional experience. After discussing central components of human friendships with animals and showing how these relationships are established and sustained, I suggest three is- sues of basic interest that we may conceptualize more broadly and fruitfully explore by directing systematic attention to interspecies relationships. First, I maintain that a sociology of human-animal relationships provides a rich context in which to ex- plore how we construct and assign the designation “person.” Next, I present the is- sue of “mindedness” and argue that the conventional, linguicentric perspective on mind-as-internal-conversation is inadequate and confining. In contrast, I propose an expanded view of mind that, like personhood, we can best understand as arising out of social interaction. In essence, I maintain that people “do mind” as a coopera- tive interpretive process that does not depend on the ability of all parties to express their thoughts lingustically. Finally, I discuss culture as a collection of shared under- standings that arises out of face-to-face interaction. Culture provides the basis for evaluating immediate situations, interpreting the perspective of others, and devising means for achieving goals, and, as such, it establishes the foundation for effective collective action. As caretakers pursue the everyday routines that express and solid- ify their relationships with their animal companions, they cooperatively create a private, interspecies culture that is simple and immediate and acts as an effective practical basis for interaction. Identity, personhood, empathy, love, mindedness, culture, and other key issues are of considerable interest to interactionists and are of central relevance for the so- ciology of close relationships. The central point of this article is that these key issues may be fruitfully explored if we turn serious and appreciative attention to the human- animal bond and the social exchanges that both define and result from this unique form of sociation. This task requires that we move beyond the analytic restraints imposed by the presumption that shared symbols are the sole foundation for “real” intimate relationships and “authentic” interactions. THE LITERATURE ON HUMAN-ANIMAL RELATIONSHIPS Since Bryant (1979) advocated that increased attention should be paid to the “zoo- logical connection,” analysts of social behavior from a variety of disciplines have been heeding his call. Due to early interest in the therapeutic utility of interactions with animals (Levinson 1965), a significant proportion of the extant literature has focused on the positive impact of relationships with animals on the physical and </page> <page sequence="4">    408 Symbolic Interaction Volume 26, Number 3, 2003 psychological well-being of their human partners (e.g., Baun et al. 1984; Beck and Katcher 1996:125–59; Friedmann et al. 1980; Hendy 1984). A related body of work has examined the uniquely intense relationships between people with disabilities and their assistance animals. These works highlight the impact of the human-animal relationship on people’s identities and self-definitions (e.g., Michalko 1999; Sanders 2000), emotional health (e.g., Valentine, Kiddoo, and LaFleur 1993; Zee 1983), and public encounters (e.g., Hart, Hart, and Bergin 1987; Warnath and Seyfarth 1982). Since people’s interactions with companion animals typically occur in the family context, the place of animals in familial relationships has received considerable at- tention. This literature regards household pets as full-fledged participants in the family system (e.g., Cain 1983, 1985; Hickrod and Schmitt 1982) and as playing a significant role in shaping relationships among human family members (e.g., Beck and Katcher 1996:40–62; Smith 1983). Arguably, the richest body of literature dealing with human-animal relationships focuses on how people come to define their animal companions as unique individu- als, comprehend their mental experience, and organize everyday exchanges based on these understandings. Fidler, Light, and Costall (1996), for example, interviewed students about their evaluations of dogs’ thought processes after showing them a series of videotaped sequences. They found that experienced pet caretakers were significantly more likely to define the filmed behavior as having resulted from the dog’s understanding of the situations and responding with deliberate actions. In a similar vein, Rassmussen, Rajecki, and Craft (1993) surveyed students to ascertain their perceptions of animal mentality and, in a later study, used the same research approach to examine the defined differences between the thoughts and feelings of dogs and humans (Rassmussen and Rajecki 1995). In general, the authors found, al- though the students acknowledge that dogs and humans have different cognitive abilities, they hold that the mental processes of dogs and humans are qualitatively similar. Studies employing ethnography, semistructured interviews, and introspective analysis of personal experience with companion animals have added depth to the portrayal of people’s understanding of the mentality and emotions of animals and how they use this understanding to shape interactions and relationships. For ex- ample, Sanders (1993) discussed how dog owners come to regard their nonhuman companions as unique, thoughtful, and emotional participants in social exchanges. In a parallel article, Alger and Alger (1997) examined the similar perceptions and experiences of cat owners. Focusing on human relationships with dogs and horses, respectively, Shapiro (1990) and Wipper (2000) have emphasized the central role played by touch in establishing the human-animal relationship and communicating feelings and intentions in the course of interaction (see also Beck and Katcher 1996:78–95). Although this is not an exhaustive list of the growing literature on human-animal relationships produced by analysts of social relationships and behavior, it pro- vides ample testimony to the increased interest in the topic. As I maintain, this area of </page> <page sequence="5">     Actions Speak Louder than Words 409 interest provides an excellent foundation for examining not only the substantive is- sues listed above but also matters of central relevance to the interactionist study of intimate relationships. Since companion animals typically are regarded as friends and act as partners in everyday interaction,4 attention to people’s associations with them can offer a unique view of how close relationships shape the construction and communication of identity, give rise to routine interactions that express and sustain friendship, and may be effectively grounded in empathetic understandings without the limits imposed by language. IDENTITY AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH COMPANION ANIMALS Identity is a central concept in sociological psychology. Although scholars disagree somewhat about the specific elements of the concept (Cerulo 1997; Strauss 1997; Stryker and Burke 2000), identity is, essentially, a social categorization composed of the characteristics one uses when defining his or her self and those that are employed by others to orient interaction. Identity is both the basis for and consequence of inter- action. As Stone states: [I]dentity establishes what and where the person is in social terms. . . . [W]hen one has an identity, he is situated—that is, cast in the shape of a social object by acknowledgment of his participation or membership in social relations. . . . To have an identity is to join with some and depart from others, to enter and leave social relations at once. . . . To engage meaningfully in some transactions it is enough to know merely “what” the parties are—to know their identities. (1981:188–90) Identities arise and are employed in specific situations and serve as major defini- tional “pegs” (Goffman 1963a:57) by which actors make sense of themselves, co-actors, and the situation that encompasses and constrains their interactions. In turn, identity is connected to actors’ roles, statuses, histories, and group memberships. It establishes a person’s connections to others and demonstrates his or her uniqueness from others. CONSTRUCTING ANIMAL IDENTITY Identity construction in the context of interspecies interaction has some unique fea- tures in that problems involved in the linked processes of altercasting (Weinstein and Deutschberger 1970) and taking the role of the other are reduced when coac- tors share similar experiences, orientations, and symbol systems. Nonhuman ani- mals do not employ conventional symbols and have perspectives markedly differ- ent from those used by their human associates. Thus the mutual understanding and assignment of complementary roles that are the foundation for routine collective action typically are tentative and emergent. Within the person-companion animal relationship the caretaker’s approach to the animal-other presupposes a preexisting identity: the animal is elementally defined as a “species representative.” He or she is assigned the characteristics encompassed </page> <page sequence="6">    410 Symbolic Interaction Volume 26, Number 3, 2003 by culturally shaped definitions such as “cat,” “dog,” “bird,” and so forth. The hu- man actor refines this basic “categorical identity” (Cahill 1998:136) when he or she takes into account the “breed characteristics” of the companion animal. To a certain degree, understandings of species characteristics are an element of the general pop- ular culture (e.g., dogs are friendly and tractable; cats are aloof and resistant to training). Knowledge of breed characteristics is central to the subcultural worlds that revolve around particular species and commonly is incorporated in practical guides intended to aid inexperienced people interested in acquiring a companion animal: Dalmatians are “unpredictable,” terriers are “high strung and energetic,” Arabian horses are “fiery,” quarter horses are “solid,” and so forth (e.g., Hart and Hart 1988; Pugnetti 1980; Rees 1984). Those embarking on relationships with com- panion animals can use this basic categorical identity information to anticipate the problems they might encounter and match their requirements and personalities to the animal they eventually acquire. While the defined attributes contained in species and breed categories form the foundation for a person’s assignment of a basic identity to his or her companion an- imal, the person sees the nonhuman other as much more than a species or breed re- presentative. Typically, the person regards the animal as an individual with an iden- tifiable history, discrete personality, and unique tastes. For example, an experienced dog owner interviewed by Sanders described the characteristics of her dog’s breed and then spoke of her animal companion as a unique individual who did not display these categorical features: She wanted to be Shirley Temple, but was born a dog instead. . . . Malamutes are peculiar dogs. Some people just don’t know how to deal with them. They expect them to be like a Golden or something—“Go over there and sit in the corner!”— and they just do it. You have to be strong with a Malamute. They aren’t that domes- ticated. They are raised to pull sleds and you want them to be able to decide things like if the ice is too thin—to think for themselves. If you aren’t strong with them then they think they are the boss and you are going to have real trouble. She’s not like that. She’s just the sweetest. She is like that in the show ring. She makes eyes at the judges and charms them. She’s sweet with most people. (1999:155) In very different terms the phenomenological psychologist Shapiro describes the centrality of shared historical experience in shaping his relationship with and feel- ing for his dog, Sabaka: History informs the experience of a particular animal whether or not it can tell that history. Events in the life of an animal shape and even constitute him or her. . . . Sabaka is an individual in that he is not constituted through and I do not live toward him as a species-specific behavioral repertoire or developmental se- quence. More positively, he is an individual in that he is both subject to and sub- ject of “true historical particulars.”. . . I can not replace him, nor, ethically, can I “sacrifice” him for he is a unique individual being. (1989:187) The process of assigning names to encountered objects is central to the produc- tion of the namer’s orientation to and action toward that object. As Strauss (1997:20–24) puts it:  </page> <page sequence="7">    Actions Speak Louder than Words 411 To name is to know and the extent of knowing is dependent upon the extent of the naming. . . . The act of naming is central to any human’s cognition of his world. . . . The naming of an object provides a directive for action . . . and arouses a set of expectations toward the object thus classified. A major means, therefore, by which the caretaker solidifies the unique identity of the animal companion is by assigning the animal a name. One indication of the crucial importance of naming as a way to cast the individuality and unique identity of an animal is that conventional ethologists5 strongly discourage the assignment of names. Settings such as factory farms and animal “shelters”6 also strongly discour- age naming. In these settings, workers conventionally regard animals as objects rather than individual beings and believe that affording them individual identities could potentially thwart organizational goals. Phillips (1994), for example, discusses the strong disinclination of laboratory scientists (but not technicians) to individual- ize lab animals by assigning them names. As she points out, naming an animal would transform it from a “piece of scientific equipment” into a “pet.” Such individ- ualization would, in turn, make the use of the animal in painful experiments and his or her eventual “sacrifice” more emotionally problematic.7 A variety of factors shape the choice of the name assigned to a companion ani- mal. Popular culture plays a role, as humans name animals after those in films, newspaper comics, and on television (e.g., Garfield, Tramp). The animal’s individual attributes also shape this choice as he or she is named for special physical features (e.g., Freckles, Fluffy, Brandy) or notable behaviors and interests (e.g., Nibbles, Spinner, Bones). However, the most common convention is to give the companion animal a human name, thereby symbolically casting him or her in the role of virtual person with uniquely individual characteristics (see Cain 1983:75; Harris 1983). As Beck and Katcher (1996:11–12) observe:  The pet’s name goes beyond the individuality provided by breed and the asso- ciation . . . to some word or symbol that links that animal and person. . . . The act of naming implies that these animals are going to be given special treat- ment and that individual attributes or personalities are likely to be claimed for them. The pivotal importance of the companion animal’s name as an identity reference point in human-animal interaction is illustrated in Mitchell and Edmonson’s re- search (1999). In their observations of play exchanges between dogs and their care- takers, they note that the animal’s name was the second most repeated utterance (next to the command “Come”) used during interspecies play. THE IMPACT OF THE HUMAN-ANIMAL RELATIONSHIP ON CARETAKER IDENTITY One of the most significant connections between identity and associations with com- panion animals is seen in the animals’ impact on how caretakers are socially defined. </page> <page sequence="8">    412 Symbolic Interaction Volume 26, Number 3, 2003 Historically, in Western cultures the ownership of expensive and “nonfunctional” animals indicated upper-class status (Ritvo 1987; Serpell 1986:38–47). In contrast, when owned by members of the lower classes, these animals were defined as an “unwarranted indulgence” (Ritvo 1988:27). To some extent, ownership of expensive, pedigreed, or rare animals continues to demonstrate a person’s economic position. More commonly, however, animal com- panions now symbolize important elements of their caretakers’ lifestyles, recre- ational interests, and self-identities (Aylesworth, Chapman, and Doscha 1999). In addition, pet keeping demonstrates the caring and sociable nature of the person. Lockwood (1983), for example, found that undergraduate college students rated people pictured with animals in TAT-style scenes more sociable, happier, and less tense than those who were not. The identity-shaping impact of association with a companion animal is especially apparent when people and animals are together in public. In these circumstances the human and animal assume a “couple identity” (Blumstein 1997:308–9; Felmlee and Sprecher 2000:367–68) as those they encounter treat them as a unit. For good or ill, other people socially link the identities and behaviors of people and their ani- mal companions. The vast majority of extant research demonstrates the positive identity effects of being accompanied in public by an animal. Companion animals act as “social facili- tators” (Robins, Sanders, and Cahill 1991).8 In one of the best-known studies of the sociability effects of being accompanied by a companion animal, Messent (1983, 1984) observed people walking in an urban park. Those with dogs spoke with strangers more frequently during each walk and held significantly longer exchanges than did those without a dog present (see also Rogers, Hart, and Boltz 1993). Studies of persons with disabilities accompanied in public by their assistance ani- mals show a similar pattern. Disabled individuals interviewed by Hart, Hart, and Bergin (1987) reported that they had an average of eight positive encounters with strangers when in the company of their service dogs. In contrast, they only had one positive encounter when alone. In an observational study of wheelchair users both with and without assistance dogs, Eddy, Hart, and Boltz (1988) found that people accompanied by dogs received significantly more social acknowledgment than did those without dogs. In public situations of identity construction and display, therefore, animals serve as social facilitators in that they are sources of “mutual openness” (Goffman 1963a:131– 39). They offer strangers an easy and nonthreatening focus of short-term inter- action. However, for both everyday pet owners and those who depend on service animals, being defined as constituting a “with” (Goffman 1971:19) with an animal is not always an identity-enhancing experience. The visually impaired guide dog users interviewed by Sanders (2000), for example, spoke of their assistance animals as sometimes stigmatizing in that they publicly demonstrated their owners “degraded” identity (Goffman 1963b). In addition, the service dog frequently attracted un- wanted attention; strangers initiated unsolicited and inconvenient interaction with </page> <page sequence="9">  Actions Speak Louder than Words 413 the owner, defining him or her as an “open person” because of the dog (Goffman 1963a:126). For example: The major thing that annoys me the most about having a dog has nothing to do with the dog itself. It’s going into public places like shopping malls and having people kind of invading your personal space. [They want to] pet the dog, talk about the dog, ask about the dog; their kids are going crazy over the dog. It is an invasion of personal space. It’s like when you go to the mall you are a movie star or something. You can’t get anywhere and you can’t get done what you want to do. It is something you get used to, but it does get to you. (Sanders 2000:135; see also Cahill and Eggleston 1994) The linked identity of people and their companion animals has yet another po- tential problematic consequence. As the most “responsible” member of the human- animal couple, everyone expects the person to control the animal. Consequently, when the animal bites, fails to “mind” the caretaker, jumps on strangers, or in other ways breaches the boundaries of “appropriate” public behavior, the caretaker’s identity suffers. He or she becomes the focus of others’ judgmental responses and must engage in “remedial work” (Goffman 1971:95–187) to repair the identity dam- age and reestablish the more or less smooth flow of human-to-human interaction. Based on observations of dog-person couples in public settings and in a “puppy kin- dergarten,” Sanders (1990) details eight “excusing tactics” (placing blame on the im- mediate situation, redefining the impropriety as “cute,” overtly disciplining the of- fending animal, and so forth) employed by caretakers to remedy the negative identity effects precipitated by their dogs’ misbehavior. Use of these remedial moves dem- onstrates that people are aware of a negative “reflection process” (Cialdini and Richardson 1980) relative to their association with their animal companions. They recognize that their social identities are linked to the identity of the human-animal couple in that people and their animals act together to present both collective and individual definitions of self and the situation (Goffman 1959). Identity, then, clearly is central to the relationship between people and compan- ion animals. To the extent that a person is more or less successful in taking the role of the (animal) other, his or her mutual interactions are knowable and predictable, and then the person and his or her animal can effectively engage in collective ac- tion. Further, the person’s association with the animal companion affects his or her identity. The person-animal couple identity shapes human-to-human interactions. In both public and private situations, the human partner must offer excuses, explain the animal’s experience, exercise control, and engage in other forms of “identity work” (Blumstein 1997:308–9) whereby the shared identity of the human-animal couple is displayed, enhanced, or repaired. As with other close relationships, the linkage between the person and the animal companion has a significant impact on the self-identity of the human partner (Blumstein 1997). To the extent that human-animal interactions proceed more or less smoothly and rewardingly, the person incorporates certain positive elements (responsible, knowledgeable, etc.) into his or her self-definition.9 Since, as discussed </page> <page sequence="10">     414 Symbolic Interaction Volume 26, Number 3, 2003 next, a person commonly defines his or her relationship with a companion animal as a form of friendship, routine interactional experiences within this close relationship have special salience for the person’s self-identity and general level of relational satisfaction. THE HUMAN-ANIMAL FRIENDSHIP If you want a friend for life, get a dog. —Harry Truman (quoted in Rubin 1985:15) As a general form of association, close relationships are those in which participants mutually shape and connect their behavior, emotions, and thoughts. This inter- dependence consists of sharing strong and enduring commitments with frequent in- teractions (Clark and Reis 1988; Kelley et al. 1983). In friendship, a special type of close relationship, mutual understanding of the perspectives and routine responses of the parties involved is of key importance (Kenny and Kashy 1994). This under- standing allows friends to construct a stable and durable relationship and provides the foundation for anticipating a mutual future (Blumstein 1997:316; Hays 1989:34). In turn, friendships are emotionally rich because friends share companionship, pro- vide mutual support, act as confidants, and enjoy shared activities. Emotional con- nectedness assumes that friends like each other, see each other as warm and sup- portive, and recognize each other’s unique and appealing personal characteristics (Sprecher 1998). People symbolize and reinforce their friendship relationship by close proximity, physical contact, and mutual gaze (Argyle 1992:56–57; Fehr 2000). People commonly understand their connections to companion animals through defining them as “members of the family” (Cain 1983; Voith 1983). Alternatively, or in conjunction with this familial incorporation, caretakers most commonly define their pets as “special” or “close” friends (Nieburg and Fischer 1982; Stallones et al. 1988). They understand and sustain their friendships with animal companions in much the same way as they do human-to-human friendships. The partners in the re- lationship spend time together and share routine activities. People feed, groom, touch, speak to, and incorporate their pets into holidays and other ritual events (Alger and Alger 1997; Sanders 1993; Smith 1983). Play is a social activity in which players direct their actions toward a mutually de- fined goal, but shared understandings about “appropriate” moves and counter- moves constrain the means of achieving this goal. Play participants recognize that the interaction is supposed to be frivolous or pleasurable (Mitchell 1990:200–204). Mutual play is a central mode of interaction between people and their nonhuman friends.10 In contrast to human-with-human play, in which competition is a central factor, human-animal play does not have winners or losers since keeping the play interaction going is the primary shared goal. In addition, because human and ani- mal players have different levels of mental and physical ability (humans are more deceitful and animals more agile, for example), participants must learn to adjust their efforts in order to sustain the play interaction (Beck and Katcher 1996:31–33). </page> <page sequence="11">  Actions Speak Louder than Words 415 In other words, both person and companion animal must, in a rudimentary way, take the role of the other and adjust their actions on the basis of this orientation. Human-animal play requires that the players communicate the definition of the situation and the “rules” and goals of the game through their actions. Mechling em- phasizes the communicative nature of play in describing interaction with his Labrador, Sunshine: The game of fetch was truly interactive. I was not always in control of the game. Sometimes Sunshine would fetch the ball but stop on the way back to me some ten feet away. He would begin a slow retriever stalk, then drop the ball in front of him and assume the familiar canine “play bow”—forepaws extended flat on the ground, the body sloping upward toward his erect hind-quarters, tail wag- ging. This is the canine invitation to play. In this case, however, we were already engaged in a game, so his message to me was that he, too, could exert some power and control in the game. (1989:313; see also Shapiro 1990:186) As a routine form of friendly interaction, then, human-animal play involves com- municating a mutual definition of the situation and designating certain physical ob- jects as “game pieces.” Playing necessitates that the players recognize and antici- pate each other’s orientations and expectations (Allen and Bekoff 1997:87–114; Mitchell and Thompson 1986). Although ostensibly frivolous, play is a key example of human-animal communication. Within its mutually understood boundaries the players honestly or deviously signal their intentions, adjust and shape their own and the other’s actions, and reinforce the communicative connection at the heart of effective collective action. Shared focus of attention and mutual eye contact are central to all forms of face- to-face interaction (Duncan and Fisk 1977:80–88; Kendon 1977:13–51), but they are of special significance in interactions between friends. Sharing attention demon- strates a measure of shared subjectivity (Myers 1998:95, 98). Sanders, using obser- vations made while interacting with his companion dogs, discusses the importance of mutual gaze and its implications for taking the role of the other: When [the dogs] look at me they usually pay attention to my eyes. I have noticed on walks how important looking is to them. A common way that one will com- municate to the other that she wants to play is by staring. During play they have a variety of ways of signaling “time out.” In addition to stopping and avidly sniff- ing someplace, a player can effectively suspend the game by staring fixedly off into the middle distance. The other dog typically responds to this move by look- ing to see if there is actually anything important to look at. They do the same with me. If on the walk I stop and look in a particular direction, they will stop, glance at me, and gaze off in the direction I am looking. This seems a fairly clear indication of their elemental ability to put themselves into my perspective. In a literal sense they attempt to assume my “point of view.” If I look at something they conclude that it is probably something important. (1999:144) Sustained eye contact signals the close character of the relationship to coactors (Argyle 1992:50) and to those in their presence (Goffman 1971:188–237). The re- search on people’s interactions with their companion animals (e.g., Cain 1985; </page> <page sequence="12">    416 Symbolic Interaction Volume 26, Number 3, 2003 Sanders 1999:143) shows that mutual “face gazing” is an extremely common form of nonverbal interaction. As in close human relationships, sustained eye contact is an el- ement of intimacy that symbolizes and reinforces the human-animal connection, and attention to facial expression provides interactants—both human and animal—with information about the subjective experience of the other. In their observations of the interactions between veterinary clients and their animals in a waiting room, Beck and Katcher (1996:43, 85–89) noted that a person would frequently hold the animal’s head and stare into his or her eyes in much the same way parents make eye contact with their children. The ability to give voice to what another is thinking is a key indicator of intersub- jectivity and an important element of the mutual knowledge of the other shared by intimates. This activity is commonly seen when parents speak for their infant children (what Kaye [1982:182] terms the “he says phenomenon”) and is an important factor in defining the nonlinguistic other as a person (Cahill 1998:139–40; Goffman 1981:86– 87). This display of intersubjectivity is also a common feature of people’s relation- ships with their companion animals. Myers (1998:12), for example, notes how the nursery school children he observed tended to “put words in the mouth” of the ani- mals with whom they interacted. Similarly, Arluke and Sanders (1996:61–81), using observations of human-animal interactions in a veterinary clinic, describe a number of examples of people giving voice to what was “on the [animal’s] mind.” Frequently, speaking for the animal is “primed” when the caretaker asks the animal a question and then voices his or her response. In the veterinary clinic clients would commonly speak for the patient when describing the symptoms that precipitated the visit. In speaking for his or her animal in this way, the person demonstrates special knowledge of the other and cooperatively constructs the mind of the nonhuman friend. All of these friendly routines are sustained within a highly emotionalized rela- tionship. Caretakers regularly speak of the ability of their animals to feel emotion11 and empathically understand the emotions of their human friends (Alger and Alger 1997; Sanders 1993). This understanding of the other’s emotional experience orients the human actor’s behavior toward the animal and acts as a practical basis for suc- cessful and satisfying collective action. Further, the animal’s defined ability to read and respond appropriately to the caretaker’s emotional experience enhances the friendship. An individual interviewed by Sanders touchingly described his golden retriever’s empathetic abilities: He just seems to sense [your mood] somehow. You can be in a different room and be down. Recently when [my daughter] was in her room he just seemed to know where to go . . . he sensed that somewhere in this house—his doghouse— there was something that was not quite right. He sought [her] out and was just there. One day I was sitting on the front porch kind of blue about some things and he just snuggled in there—totally noninvasive. Just “If you want to pet me, pet me. I’m here if you need me.” (1999:21–22) Close relationships, which involve emotional bonds and shared intimate knowl- edge, have negative as well as positive elements. Intense conflicts, fear of loss, concern </page> <page sequence="13">  Actions Speak Louder than Words 417 with overinvolvement, and other painful experiences are part of the “dark side” (Felmlee and Sprecher 2000:371) of friendships. Consequently, friends commonly experience some degree of ambivalence about the quality, consequences, and course of their shared close relationship (Hays 1989; Kurth 1970). In that people perceive them as both objects to be possessed and used and indi- vidual beings to be understood and loved, companion animals have a liminal status that results in a distinctly ambivalent general cultural orientation to them (Arluke and Sanders 1996:167–86; Tuan 1984). This cultural ambivalence, together with the subordinate status of companion animals within the human-animal association, all too frequently leads to abuse, thoughtless disregard, and, ultimately, termination of the relationship. More commonly, however, the emotional connection that binds the typical close relationships between people and their companion animals means that committed owners anticipate and react to the termination of these relationships—through ill- ness, accident, straying, or voluntary euthanasia precipitated by the animals’ age or infirmity—with intense sorrow. For example, a dog owner interviewed by Sanders offered an “acquisition story” in which she described special feelings she had for her dog and her sorrowful anticipation of eventual loss: I just told my parents I wanted a dog. I was living with my parents then. A lady down the street had a litter. I went in and immediately he came right over to me. It was love at first sight—he chose me. I remember it was really snowing that night and we couldn’t get to the grocery store. My mother made him chicken soup. To this day he goes wild when he smells chicken soup. Every time I make it he gets half. Sometimes this annoys my roommate “Hey, I wanted some of that.” But he is more important. He’s not a dog to me. He’s my best friend. He loves me and I love him. When I come home from work he’s happy to see me and I am happy to see him. I try to spend quality time with him every day. . . . He gives me love. He can’t live without me and I can’t live without him. It’s so hard to see him getting old. I just don’t know what I would do without him. (1999:23)12 Like other close relationships, then, those between people and companion ani- mals are characterized by commitment and ambivalence, rewards and problems, connectedness and loss. As seen above, these sociologically “neglected” relation- ships (Felmlee and Sprecher 2000:370) share many of the characteristics found in friendships between humans. However, unique differences between the partici- pants in these common and emotionally involving relationships—specifically, that the interactants are members of different species and the animal partner lacks the ability to use human language—provide a foundation for exploring issues of key interest and expanding the scope of symbolic interactionism. In short, through ex- amining the everyday exchanges between people and animals we can gain an en- riched understanding of the social processes by which the designation “person” is constructed and applied, the phenomenon of “mind” arises within social relation- ships, and culture is interactionally created as a framework for effective collective action. </page> <page sequence="14">     418 Symbolic Interaction Volume 26, Number 3, 2003 PERSONS, MINDS, AND CULTURE The designation “person” is the most elemental social identity. It provides the foun- dation for, and is constructed in the context of, relationships. As a basic categorical identity, personhood may be acquired or lost, given or taken away, solidified or ad- justed within the flow of interaction that comprises relationships. Everyday, face-to- face social exchanges provide the materials used in the “collaborative manufacture” (Cahill 1998:136) of the person as interactants define the immediate situation, act in particular ways, and attend to each other’s responses. To the extent that responses are “appropriate” to the situation and coactors’ understanding of each other, person- identities are enacted and reinforced. Based on a shared history and knowledge of the other’s unique personality, tastes, emotions, and routine responses, caretakers come to regard the compan- ion animals with whom they have relationships as persons and treat them as such. The animal’s personhood is an interactive accomplishment based on his or her definition as it arises in the context of the relationship (Bogdan and Taylor 1989:136). In applying a “person schema” (Howard 1995:93) to shape and under- stand his or her interaction with the animal, the caretaker commonly makes a distinction between “person” and “human.” The animal is a person in the sense that his or her perspective and feelings are knowable; interaction is predictable; and the shared relationship provides an experience of closeness, warmth, and pleasure. In an important way, the distinction between relationships with hu- mans and with animal-persons is central to the special character of the human- animal bond. Because they are not human relationships, those with companion animals are constant rather than contingent. The animal’s response to his or her companion does not depend on the latter’s appearance, age, economic fortunes, abilities, or the other vagaries that, for good or ill, constrain human-to-human relationships. Similarly, mind is an interactional accomplishment. Mead (1962:73) regarded mind as an internal linguistic activity, and, therefore, denied its existence in non- human animals. This Meadian conception of mind-as-self-conversation is, I main- tain, unnecessarily restrictive. As we interact with others, we premise our actions and responses on the presumption that the content of our minds has some basic re- lationship to what and how our coactors are thinking. However, the elemental evi- dence for this presumption is drawn from our interpretations of others’ behavior and the predictive utility of these interpretations. As people interact with infants (Russell 1997), alingual humans (Bogdan and Taylor 1989; Goode 1994), and non- human animals (Alger and Alger 1997, Wieder 1980), they regard the ability to focus attention, manipulate objects, seek or avoid certain experiences, and engage in ac- tion directed at achieving particular ends as persuasive evidence of mind. The greater familiarity with the other—the closer our relationship with him or her—the more confidence we have in our understanding of the content of his or her mind and our ability to gauge his or her intentions (Herzog and Galvin 1997). Casting off the </page> <page sequence="15">  Actions Speak Louder than Words 419 linguicentric and anthropomorphic restraints of conventional views of mind frees us to appreciate an expanded world of social relationships and understand the in- teractions from which they are constructed. On the other hand, denying the reality of “wordless minds” (Terrace 1987) would not allow us to make sense of the follow- ing description offered by an experienced dog owner or draw the reasonable con- clusion at which she arrives. We halfheartedly train the dogs to sit on the floor in a long stay while we eat our meal. I think sharing food is very important; so do they. It becomes, how- ever, too disturbing, and we’ve limited them to table food at the end of the meal. But Toby has problems with waiting when there’s butter on the table. Toby lies down, hops up, drops his head on the table, positions it next to the butter—it is always the butter—sighs over the butter. . . . He must think we are awfully stupid not to understand what he wants. . . . Once, though, the temptation being overwhelming, Toby thought through the problem of how to get the bread and butter. He did not lie down on command but left the room. We heard him rummaging around in the house, up and down the stairs, until he finally appeared with a treasure: a roasted pig ear. . . . Toby is al- lowed to take one out of the box each day. He had obviously hidden this one. He laid it at my feet. Naturally Toby received a piece of bread with slabs of butter. Toby reasoned and came up with the idea of trade. (Lerman 1996:112–13) Culture, like personhood and mindedness, is constructed and shared through interaction. As Becker (1986) observes, the “most minimal definition” of culture is that it is composed of mutual understandings (“conventions”) that interactants use to coordinate their activities (“collective action”). Culture arises as a response to situations and lends predictability to interaction. In the relational context of friendship, interactants commonly create what Fine (1981:267) refers to as a “private culture.” Friends use these “dyadic traditions” to “test whether they are sensitive to the same aspects of the immediate experience and whether they share a common orientation toward this experience, to symbol- ize their intimacy, and to activate a sense of a shared past” (Mechling 1989:312– 13). As is the case in human-with-human friendships, close relationships between people and companion animals give rise to a dyadic culture that encompasses es- tablished routines (what Collins [1989] calls “natural interaction rituals”), mutual knowledge of and feeling for the other, and expectations about the predictable course of interaction. What is unique about the culture shared by humans and ani- mals, and of special significance in advancing an interactionist understanding of human-animal relationships, is that these conventions arise and are effectively communicated despite the fact that the parties in the relationship do not share the ability to employ a common system of linguistic symbols. As with the definition of personhood and the social construction of mind, the creation, communication, and competent use of culture is not dependent on language (see Depre 1990; de Waal 1999:636). </page> <page sequence="16">     420 Symbolic Interaction Volume 26, Number 3, 2003 CONCLUSION The aspects of things that are most important for us are hidden because of their simplicity and familiarity. (One is unable to notice something because it is al- ways before one’s eyes.) —Ludwig Wittgenstein (quoted in Fine 1998:102) I have offered a brief, and admittedly somewhat rhetorical, discussion of a type of close relationship that until fairly recently has been largely unexamined in conven- tional sociology. My primary goal has been to advocate the movement of inter- species interactions and relationships into the repertoire of issues on which interaction- ists focus. This movement requires that we reject (or at least bracket) conventional social scientific and cultural beliefs about the qualitative differences between hu- mans and nonhuman animals. Serious attention to human-animal relationships re- quires that the anthropocentric “commonsense of science” be replaced with the “ordinary commonsense” of everyday social actors derived from their routine expe- riences with their animal companions (Silverman 1997). The primary goal of symbolic interactionism is to make social life intelligible. The central orienting principle guiding the achievement of this goal is that humans act toward things based on the meanings that emerge through social interaction (Blumer 1969). It may be that the “reality” of those who foster close relationships with companion animals, see them as thoughtful and reciprocating, construct their unique identities, and regard them as full-fledged partners in collective action is an anthropomorphic “delusion.” Clearly Mead believed this to be the case: We, of course, tend to endow our domestic animals with personality, but as we get insight into their conditions we see there is no place for this sort of importa- tion of the social process into the conduct of the individual. They do not have the mechanism for it—language. So we say that they have no personality; they are not responsible for the social situation in which they find themselves. . . . We put personalities into the animals, but they do not belong to them. . . . And yet the common attitude is that of giving them just such personalities as our own. We talk to them and in our talking to them we act as if they had the sort of inner world that we have. (1962:182–83) But, to remain true to the interactionist view of human beings as actively in- volved in evaluating situations, defining others, having goals, devising reasonable plans of action, and coordinating their interactions with others, I submit that we must see those who foster close relationships with animals as more than the delu- sional victims of “folk psychology.”13 As active and practical creators of meaning, caretakers base understandings of their animal companions and construct effective relationships with them on routine experience with their “behavior in context” (Mitchell and Hamm 1997). Theories—be they folk or sociological—are best judged by how useful they are rather than by whether they are right or wrong (Bernstein 1990; Feyerabend 1975). Because of the linguicentric constraints imposed by our Meadian heritage we have emphasized the differences that exist between humans and nonhuman animals and </page> <page sequence="17">     Actions Speak Louder than Words 421 have “lost sight of all that we share with them” (Murphy 1995:692). In failing to rec- ognize the fact that we live in an interactional community composed of both human and nonhuman members, we have ignored an area of social life that is common- place, emotionally rich, and of significant analytic interest. Moving nonhuman ani- mals and people’s relationships with them into the realm of “sociological visibility” (Oakley 1974:5) promises to shed light on commonplace worlds of social inter- action to which conventional interactionism has, until recently, turned a blind eye.

NOTES 1. According to recent figures collected by the American Veterinary Medical Association (1997), companion animals live in 58.9 percent of U.S. households. Americans own 59 million cats, 52.9 million dogs, 12.6 million birds, 5.7 million rabbits and ferrets, 4.8 million rodents, 3.5 mil- lion reptiles, and 55.6 million fish. 2. For an early exception, see Bain 1929. 3. For critiques of Mead’s views with regard to the social abilities of nonhuman animals, see Alger and Alger 1997; Myers 1998:120–25; Sanders 1993. 4. Testimony to the centrality of people’s relationships to their pets is seen in a survey conducted by the American Animal Hospital Association (1996) in which close to half of the women questioned said that they relied more on their dogs and cats for affection than they did on their husbands or children. Fifteen percent of the elderly questioned in a Swedish study (Adell-Bath et al. 1978) stated that they considered their pets their “most significant” source of social contact and that this relationship gave their lives meaning. 5. See Speier (1970:209–17) for a discussion of the centrality of personal names in close inter- human relationships. 6. An anonymous reviewer with personal experience in an animal shelter observed that dogs and cats typically were given names by the workers in her facility. An important distinction here is the difference between “kill” and “no-kill” shelters. In the former, the emotional toll of eutha- nizing healthy but unadopted animals is increased when the animals are named and thus indi- vidualized (see Arluke 1994). In no-kill shelters, in contrast, naming is routine since the individ- ualized animals will, at worst, simply remain as residents of the shelter (see Alger and Alger 2003). 7. When she attempted to publish a paper based on her early work with chimpanzees, the prima- tologist Jane Goodall encountered criticism from reviewers because she insisted on naming the animals she observed and referred to them as “he” and “she” rather than “it” (Bekoff 1998:16). 8. Eighty-three percent of pet owners questioned by Adell-Bath and her associates (1979) agreed with the statement “My dog gives me the opportunity of talking with other people.” Thirty-seven percent of the members of pet-owning families studied by Cain (1983) observed that their companion animals helped to increase their social contacts. 9. A study by Kidd and Feldmann (1981) found that elderly pet owners used more positive ad- jectives when describing themselves than did nonowners, and Serpell (1981) reports that women who owned dogs saw themselves as significantly more attractive than did nonowners. </page> <page sequence="18">     422 Symbolic Interaction Volume 26, Number 3, 2003 10. Hart (1995:164–65) cites one study in which dog owners maintained that 44 percent of their interaction with their dogs involved play (36 percent for cat owners). 11.

See Simon 1984 and Stallones 1994 for discussions of the negative features of close relation- ships with companion animals. 13.
