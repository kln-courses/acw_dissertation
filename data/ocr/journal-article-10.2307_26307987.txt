Boone Department of Art, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA 70118, USA Abstract The colossal "Coatlicue" sculpture has usually been interpreted as a representation of the female supernatural Coatlicue (Serpents Her Skirt) who gave birth to the Mexica patron deity Huitzilopochtli, or it has been identified as the cult figure of Cihuacoatl (Woman Serpent) or Tlaltecuhtli (Earth Lord). This paper offers an alternative reading of the monumental statue, one that recognizes the existence of at least three nearly identical "Coatlicues" and thus recontextualizes the monument as one of a larger set. The iconography of these great stone females points to their identity as Tzitzimime, celestial demons who were understood to descend to devour humankind if the sun were to fail. According to the Mexican chroniclers, a cadre of these fearsome monoliths dominated the sculpture progam of the Templo Mayor. The colossal "Coatlicue" (Figures 1 and 2), its andesite form ris ing 2.52 m, is the most profoundly moving work of Aztec sculp ture, considered a unique masterpiece with a central essence that is the epitome of the pre-Columbian Aztec aesthetic. So Justino Fernández conceptualized it in his groundbreaking 1954 mono graph, La Coatlicue. The "Coatlicue" and the Calendar Stone, now joined by the recently unearthed Coyolxauhqui relief, are the best known of all Aztec monuments, but it is the "Coatlicue" that con tinues to evoke the greatest emotional response. A number of Me soamericanist scholars, including myself, first became interested in Aztec culture precisely because they saw, were affected by, and ultimately wanted to understand this powerful sculpture. Although, shortly after its discovery, Antonio León y Gama (1792:37-39) identified the image as Teoyaomique (the personi fied souls of those warriors who died on the battlefield) and the consort of the solar/war god Fluitzilopochtli, the sculpture is usu ally interpreted as the cult image of the female earth-mother de ity. Since the late nineteenth century, the name assigned most prominently to the statue has been "Coatlicue" (Serpents Her Skirt), the mother of Huitzilopochtli (e.g., Chavero 1882:298, 427, 1888:103; Seler 1902-1923:2:788; Fernández 1954; Marquina 1960:112). We remember this maternal Coatlicue as the woman who was impregnated by a ball of eagle down while sweeping in the temple courtyard, according to the legend recorded by Ber nardino de Sahagún (1950—1982:3:1—5). Like the colossal statue, Huitzilopochtli's mother is noted for her skirt of intertwined ser pents. More recently, other scholars have interpreted the sculp ture more broadly as a manifestation of Cihuacoatl, the principal Aztec goddess and the old goddess of the earth, of which Coatli cue is one aspect (Carrera 1979:188; Pasztory 1983:158; Klein 1988:243). In this vein, some scholars have proposed that the statue itself stood within Tlillan, the House of Blackness that was the temple of Cihuacoatl in Tenochtitlan's ritual precinct (Seler 1902-1923:2:794; Alcocer 1935:585-559; Klein 1988:243). Oth ers, leaning away from a Cihuacoatl interpretation, have argued that the colossal statue represents the earth more broadly (Grau lich 1991; Baquedano 1993:160-161). Certainly, the "Coatlicue" sculpture manifests aspects of Coatlicue, CihuacoatI, and Tlalte cuhtli (Earth Lord), but not only these. My intent is not to refute these interpretations, for I agree largely with the arguments that support them. Rather, I want to contribute to the ongoing process of reading the "Coatlicue" by pointing out some of the sculpture's other associations, by noting how those who saw the giant sculpture described it, and by suggesting how the original stone carving may have been physically placed in the ritual precinct. Principally, I want us to reconceptualize the colos sal statue and recognize it not as a single cult image and unique masterpiece but as one example of a larger set of sculptures. The "Coatlicue" is not a singular object or even one of a pair of mon uments, and any interpretation of it must take its multiplicity into account. I argue that the colossal stone female was one of a group of several great sculptures (perhaps as many as six) called "Tzi tzimime" that were placed around the shrines of the Templo Mayor. Instead of one "Coatlicue" housed in the innermost recess of a dark shrine, there was a cadre of these awesome monoliths dom inating the iconographic program of the Templo Mayor. My approach to re-evaluating the "Coatlicues" follows three tracks. First, I consider the purely visual evidence of the "Coatli cues" and related images to obtain the one iconographic reading that dominates, in my mind, the other potential readings. Second, I turn to the prose sources to understand more deeply how the Mex ica conceptualized the supernaturals (Tzitzimime and others) rep resented by these images. Third, I look to the specific physical placement of the sculptures. This culminates in a contextualized reading of the "Coatlicues" as part of the iconographic program of the Templo Mayor. The "Coatlicues," like so many Aztec sculptures, lost their phys ical and social context when they were relocated and broken-up during the Spanish conquest and the aftermath, when Aztec cities were reworked into colonial centers. The few Aztec monuments that have been found fully in situ, such as the great Coyolxauhqui relief, reveal but a part of the rich iconographic program of the 189</page><page sequence="2">'90 Boone Figure!. Front of"Coatlicue"statue [from Brehme 1923:184]. Templo Mayor. By assigning the "Coatlicue" sculptures to their original locations and reinterpreting them in this context, this pa per adds to the ongoing efforts to understand the visual message of Tenochtitlan's ritual precinct: how Mexica power and Mexica dominance were expressed in stone. THE SONOGRAPHIC ASSEMBLAGE The Freestanding Statue The "Coatlicue" depicts a standing female whose hands are raised aggressively but who is decapitated and dismembered. The head and neck have been severed by a cut at the top of the clavicle. From this cut two serpents rise and face each other, so that the profile of each serpent head forms one half of the statue's face. These twin serpent heads visually create fearsome faces on both the front and back. The anthropomorphic body of the "Coatlicue" stands on feet that are the claws of a bird of prey, probably an eagle (Fernández 1954:213). Although the feet have been inter Figure 2.

Boone. preted as jaguar claws (Seler 1902-1923:2:790), their avian rather than feline character is assured by the single talon at the back. Circular eyes, usually associated with death ("death eyes" [Seler 1963:1:27]), animate the feet. The statue has pendant breasts that identify a mature woman who has already given birth, and the joints (namely the shoulders and elbows) are marked by distinctive fanged faces with other "death eyes." The forearms are held upraised from the elbows, and the "hands" are slightly extended in a grasping or attack position. The hands themselves are replaced with the same kind of serpents that rise at the neck. Two other serpents undulate down beneath the skirt and between the legs, one in the front and one in the back, with their heads facing forward and backward between the statue's feet. In sculptural representations, these serpents are unique to the "Coatlicue" statues and to the closely related "Coatlicue del Metro," where a serpent appears as a serpent belt (Heyden 1971). They are banded serpents, not unlike the coral snakes associated with many Aztec goddesses, but unlike the coral snakes, they are covered with a loosely woven web (in a plain, not a net, weave) interspersed regularly with jade or turquoise discs (symbols of preciousness). This jeweled web pattern is similar (but not identical) to the webbed</page><page sequence="3">The "Coatlicues" at the Templo Mayor 191 Figure 3.

Boone. turquoise patterns on the cloaks of Aztec rulers, the dotted-square patterns of skirts worn by Cihuacoatl and some other water/corn/ fertility goddesses, and the scaly markings of the cipactli (croco dile).1 On the "Coatlicue," it probably signals the quality of preciousness, as Fernández (1954:214) suggested. The serpents is sue, like great streams of blood, from the figure's neck and wrists, just as two serpents rise from the neck of a decapitated man in the Tonalamatl Aubin (Figure 3). It is clear that the "Coatlicue" statue represents a decapitated and partially dismembered female. Between the shoulders, on the upper back, is the date 12 Reed, a date I interpret as a year because it is framed by a rectangular cartouche. This year is not noted for its cosmological significance, although a passage in the Anales de Cuauhtitlan suggests that 12 Reed was the first year of the Second Age or Sun, when the sky collapsed at midday and plunged the world into darkness, where upon the people were eaten (Codex Chimalpopoca 1992:25, 26). The cosmogonic association of the year date accords with my read ing of the sculpture, as discussed below. However, we should also recognize that the date may simply indicate the year the sculpture was completed, in this case a.d. 1439 or 1491 (Umberger 1981:77). If the 12 Reed is a day rather than a year, it falls in the eighteenth trecena, governed by the goddess Chantico. The female wears a distinctive costume made of six separate components: a skirt, a belt, a back apron, a necklace, wrist bands, and leg bands. • Skirt: Below the bare chest, she wears a skirt of intertwined rattlesnakes (forming a net of serpents). • Belt: Encircling her waist is a double-headed serpent belt, tied in the front, with the two heads hanging down in front. This serpent is the same type that springs from the neck and wrists. • Back apron: In the back, the belt secures a human skull, from which depends a back apron. This back apron has two hanging tiers of braided leather cords, with long sliced shells attached at the bottom. Sahagún (1950-1982:3:16) called such a skirt or overskirt a citlalcueitl (star skirt) (Seler 1902-1923:2:790; Nicholson 1967:86), although it does not other wise carry diagnostic star imagery. Each tier is also decorated with a pair of large feathers (probably eagle feathers) held by a circular gath ering of feather down. • Necklace: The figure wears a necklace composed of alternating hearts and human hands, with a pendent skull hanging in front. The cord of this necklace, which is tied in a knot at the back, is identified as a rope of blood by the slightly wavy lines and the circular discs on its surface. • Wrist bands: Around the wrists are fringed wrist bands from which hang paper streamers. • Leg bands: Around the shins are leg bands composed of a row of plain discs, a row of feathers, and a row of copper bells hanging down, with longer feathered panels attached to the sides. The Underside Relief Carved in low relief on the underside of the monolith is a frontal, crouching figure (Figure 4). Although Fernández (1966) related the figure to Mictlantecuhtli (Lord of Mictlan, the death god), Nich Figure 4.

For the cipactli, see the Codex Borgia (21, 56).</page><page sequence="4">192 Boone olson (1967:87) has more persuasively identified the image as a Tlalocoid-Tlaltecuhtli, a male manifestation of the earth lord as the rain god, or the rain aspect of the earth lord. Such images and other versions of Tlaltecuhtli were often carved on the under side of large or important sculptures. The figure is in a standard earth-lord crouch, although presented frontally in Figure 4, with a chalchihuitl (jade) element covering the torso, and it has such Tlal tecuhtli features as clawed hands, which grasp skulls, and skulls tied loosely with cords to the arms and legs. The day/year date, 1 Rabbit, above the headdress carries multiple, layered references to the earth, because 1 Rabbit is at once the day name of Tlaltecuhtli (Caso 1959:86; Nicholson 1967:85; Ruiz de Alarcón 1984:128, 220), the year the earth was created (Codex Chimalpopoca 1992:25), and the specific year, in a.d. 1454, of the great famine that devastated highland Central Mexico. The figure's fanged mouth, heavy brow ridge, and round earspools associate it with Tlaloc. THE SET OF "COATL1CUES" Since its discovery in 1790, at the southeast corner of the Zócalo (Mateos Higuera 1979:228-229), and its publication in 1792, the "Coatlicue" has been considered by scholars and the general pub lic alike as a unique masterpiece. This singularity held true until 1933, when a badly battered monolith, now called the "Yolotli cue" (Figure 5), was unearthed at the corner of Seminario and Gua temala, near the west facade of the Templo Mayor (Marquina Figures. The"Yolotlicue." Photo by Elizabeth H. Boone. Figure 6. Fragment of the serpent skirt of another "Coatiicue." Photo by Elizabeth H. Boone. 1960:19, 115; Gurría Lacroix 1978:31). The "Yolotlicue" is iden tical to the "Coatlicue" in every respect except that it has a skirt not of intertwined rattlesnakes but of hearts. Although the upper part of the "Yolotlicue" is largely destroyed, enough detail re mains to show that it, too, had hands and a head formed by the same massive serpents. It was assigned the descriptive name "Yo lotlicue" (Hearts Her Skirt) because it is a female figure with a skirt of hearts.2 The existence of the "Yolotlicue" compelled scholars to recog nize that the "Coatlicue" was one of a pair of great monuments. Jorge Gurría Lacroix (1978) proposed that the sculptures stood as a pair of monoliths on either side of Huitzilopochtli's cult image at the Templo Mayor. Others admitted that a second variant existed but have continued to conceptualize the "Coatlicue" in the singu lar (e.g., Fernández 1954; Graulich 1991). The "Coatlicue" and "Yolotlicue" are more than a pair, how ever; the Museo Nacional de Antropología houses three other "Coatlicue" fragments. One is a piece of the skirt of intertwined serpents, which measures .97 m (Figure 6). The other is a frag ment that includes the sculpture's leg and distinctive leg bands be low the edge of the serpent skirt and beside the back apron, measuring 1.03 m (Figure 7).3 A third fragment is part of an arm with a fanged face on the elbow (Pasztory 1983:158). Their carv ing style is sufficiently similar to indicate they are roughly con temporary with each other and with the two, more complete sculptures. These three fragments either come from the same co 2 The name "Yolotlicue" does not appear in the sixteenth-century sources. 3 In 1973 the fragment of the serpent skirt (MNA no. 11-3386) was located in the lower courtyard below the director's office, and the leg fragment (no visible MNA number) was in the upper garden behind the director's office (both have since been moved to the bodega). They are illustrated together (with measurements) in Mateos Higuera (1979:263, 264, 266 [nos. 24-203 and 24-212]). Katz (1945:135) may have been the first to point out the existence of "Coatlicue" fragments, which he said he saw in the courtyard of the Museo de Antropología when it was lo cated at Calle Moneda 13.</page><page sequence="5">The "Coatlicues" at the Templo Mayor 193 Figure 7. Fragment of the leg, skirt, and back apron of another "Coatlicue." Photo by Elizabeth H. Boone. lossal female (a third in the group) or from two or three individual sculptures.4 One or more Tlalocoid-Tlaltecuhtli relief fragments may also represent the last remains of still other colossal "Coatli cues," for they recall the Tlaltecuhtli images carved on the under sides of the "Coatlicue" and "Yolotlicue" (e.g., Mateos Higuera 1979:260, 266 [no. 24-27]). Although it is difficult to say how many originals are repre sented by these actual and possible fragments, we know with cer tainty that there were at least three "Coatlicue"-like sculptures: two with serpent skirts and one with a heart skirt. RELATED IMAGES Aztec figural art is supremely multivalent. As Alfredo López Aus tin (1983) pointed out, Aztec deities and sacralities glide between precise meanings and firm identifications with the grace of quick silver, so that a supernatural force that is manifest as a sacred im age can be at one time the earth, at another time the sky, and at another time the underworld, the single figure embracing all, yet not remaining solely with one. Justino Fernández (1954) was cor rect when he characterized the monumental "Coatlicue" sculpture as the quintessence of the Aztec aesthetic, for these colossal stat ues are profound exemplars of this ideological and artistic phe nomenon. The "Coatlicue" is a sculpture that has defied efforts to compartmentalize it and define it within precise parameters. One of its great features is the multiplicity of meanings and associa tions that it embraces and brings together. Most of the physical features and costume elements of the co lossal "Coatlicues" are not specific to these sculptures (only the combination is specific to them). Rather, as individual features and elements, they are the attributes of a broad range of supernaturals, including Tlaltecuhtli (Earth Lord), Mictlantecuhtli (Mictlan or Death Lord), and the cluster of fertility/death females that in cludes Coatlicue (Serpents Her Skirt), Cihuacoatl (Woman Ser pent), the Cihuapipiltin (Princesses) or Cihuateteo (Goddesses), Itzpapalotl (Obsidian Butterfly), and the Tzitzimime (Demons). Tlaltecuhtli The most obvious sharing of attributes is with images of Tlalte cuhtli, the sexually ambivalent lord of the earth, whose form was often carved in low relief on the undersides of important sculp tures (Figures 8 and 9). Tlaltecuhtli reliefs appear on the under sides of several cult images and coiled feathered serpents, as well as many pieces of temple furniture such as cuauhxicalli ("eagle vessels" for holding hearts and blood), boxes (i.e., the Hackmack box), and cubes or small altars (i.e., Stone of Death Monsters/ Altar of Death) (e.g., Nicholson and Keber 1983:37, 54, 66). H. B. Nicholson (1955,1967,1972) securely identified these crouching, icon-laden figures as Tlaltecuhtli (Earth Lord), and he distin guished three types: a variety with "gaping teeth-studded jaws fac ing upward" (Figure 8), a human-headed variety with the head thrown back (Figure 9), and a "Tlalocoid" variety characterized by the fanged mouth of the Rain God (Figure 3).5 The first two varieties are always presented in back view, with the head thrown back as if it were wholly or partly severed at the neck (Klein 1988:243, 1994:231). These are the varieties that share the most features with the "Coatlicues." Like the giant "Coatlicues," they have eyed claws instead of hands and feet, and they have fanged faces marking their joints. A serpent belt often secures a skull to the back, below which usually hangs the back apron ("star skirt") of braided leather strips with sliced shells. In addition, these Tlal tecuhtli figures usually wear the same leg bands and occasionally the same wrist bands as do the "Coatlicues." Doris Heyden (1971) identified the "Coatlicue del Metro," discovered in the Metro ex cavations of 1967, as a three-dimensional version of Tlaltecuhtli, 4 The serpent rattles in the middle of the skirt (Figure 6) have four units, whereas the rattle along the skirt's edge (Figure 7) has five units, a relation that is similar to that of the "Coatlicue," where the middle rattles have three units and the hem rattles have four units. Thus, the two frag ments have more units per rattle than does the "Coatlicue," which favors the suggestion that they belong to the same ancient sculpture. 5 See also Baquedano (1993), Gutiérrez Solana (1990), Klein (1988: 242-245), and Matos Moctezuma (1997); Klein interpreted the second va riety (Figure 9) as a manifestation of Cihuacoatl.</page><page sequence="6">194 Boone Figure 8. Tlaltecuhtli relief [underside of Hackmack box; from Seler 1902— 1923:2:735). because it shares so many of these same iconographic elements (Figure 10). The "Coatlicue del Metro" also features a webbed serpent belt and a necklace of alternating hearts and hands (but without the pendant skull).6 Unlike the "Coatlicues," however, the Tlaltecuhtli reliefs and the painted images of the earth lord in the codices are almost al ways pictured crouching. They usually have tousled hair, have skulls tied to their limbs, and wear skirts of skulls and crossed bones; none wears a serpent skirt or a heart skirt. Their back aprons, more over, lack the two large eagle feathers and, instead, often have jag uar pelt markings that tie them more closely with the earth. Mictlantecuhtli Mictlantecuhtli images, especially as these are painted in the Co dex Magliabechiano and Codex Tudela, share many of the icono graphic features of the Tlaltecuhtli reliefs. They, too, have claws (usually eyed claws) for hands and feet and can have fanged faces at the joints. Their skulls are topped by tousled hair punctuated by the rectangular banners that symbolize sacrifice. One image in the Codex Magliabechiano (Figure 11) features a serpent belt, but with out the attached skull or back apron. Fierce Women Supernaturals The same general cluster of iconographic elements also character izes the group of fearsome, creator/destroyer women that includes the old goddesses Coatlicue and Cihuacoatl, the Cihuapipiltin or Cihuateteo (spirits of women who died in childbirth), the warrior goddess Itzpapalotl, and the monstrous Tzitzimime. Painted and sculpted images of these women usually have fleshless jaws and the round "death" eyes of skulls; they usually also have tousled hair often punctuated with the paper banners that symbolize sac rifice. Like the "Coatlicues," the Tlaltecuhtli reliefs, and the painted Mictlantecuhtli images, the fierce women supernaturals often have claws instead of hands, and they can have eyed claws on their joints. These physical features and costume elements form an icono graphic package that characterizes a broad range of supernaturals related to the earth, the underworld, or death. The package in cludes fleshless jaws and skulls, open mouths with teeth bared, tousled hair with or without sacrificial banners, fanged faces at the joints, claws for hands and feet, and distinctive wrist and leg bands. Appearing individually or as a cluster, the elements do not them selves specify the identity of an individual supernatural; rather, they describe and qualify a number of supernaturals who overlap Figure 9. Tlaltecuhtli relief (from Chavero 1888:750]. 6 The serpent heads that peer outward beneath each knee may be the two heads of the double-headed belt.</page><page sequence="7">The "Coatlicues" at the Templo Mayor 195 Figúrelo. The"Coatlicue del Metro"(from Heyden 1971:154], ideologically. Therefore, the presence of some of these icono graphic features on the "Coatlicues" and on the Tlaltecuhtli reliefs does not mean that the colossal statues are manifestations of the earth; rather, their presence indicates that the "Coatlicues" and the Tlaltecuhtli reliefs, like Mictlantecuhtli and the group of fierce women, share some of the same ideological characteristics. SHARED ICONOGRAPHY AND FEMALE CHARACTERISTICS The identity of the colossal "Coatlicue," I feel, lies not with the Tlaltecuhtli reliefs but with the female supernaturals. The "Coatli cue" is blatantly female, with her bare chest and skirt, and the col lapsed, pendent condition of her breasts shows her to be a mature, perhaps old, woman. Like the Coyolxauhqui relief, the "Coatli cue" statue presents a beheaded and dismembered female, a state that allies her with other conquered or killed women (Klein 1994:241-243). Great serpents spring from her wounds to replace visually her head and hands. The colossal "Coatlicues" share specific iconographic features with the female supernaturals. Painted representations of Cihua coatl (Serpent Woman) present the old fertility goddess with either a fleshless jaw or a skull, tousled hair, wrist bands with hanging pa per streamers, and a skirt much like the back apron of the "Coatli cue" and the Tlaltecuhtli reliefs (Figure 12) (Codex Borbonicus 23, Figure II. Mictlantecuhtli, from Codex MagUabechiano 79r [1970]. Figure 12. Cihuacoatl, Codex Borbomcus 23 (from Seler 1963:1:216].</page><page sequence="8">196 Boone Figure 13. Sculpture of one of the Cihuapipiltin. Photo by Elizabeth H. Boone. Codex Magliabechiano 45r).7 Sahagún (1950-1982:3:16) men tioned this "star skirt" as part of the array of Teteo innan (Mother of the Gods), also called Toci (Our Grandmother; Nicholson 1967:86). The related, but minor, goddesses Yxcuina and Chantico wear the same braided leather and shell garment as either a skirt or a back apron. Chantico also wears the distinctive wrist and leg bands of the "Coatlicue" (Codex Telleriano-Remensis 17v,21v; Tonalamatl Aubin 18); in the Tonalamatl Aubin (18), she has a banded serpent issuing out from beneath her throne. Sculpted images of the Cihuapipiltin (Princesses), the souls of women who have died in childbirth, likewise wear this "star skirt" that ends in sea-snail shells—like the Cihuacoatl, they wear it as a skirt rather than a back device—and they have skeletal faces (Fig ure 13).8 Although Cihuapipiltin sculptures usually are kneeling, like the "Coatlicue" they are usually bare breasted and have outstretched clawed hands that seem ready to attack. One finely carved example wears a crown of skulls, a necklace strung with a skull and severed hands, and wrist bands with paper streamers (Figure 13). Figure 14. Coatlicue, the mother of Huitzilopochtli (from Sahagún 1979:3: Folio 3r). The oid goddess Coatlicue (Serpents Her Skirt) assumes a sim ilar pose and aspect when she is shown giving birth to Huitzilo pochtli (Figure 14). At Coatepec, Coatlicue kneels while the serpents of her skirt writhe about her thighs. Although her face is fleshed in this European-style illustration, she still has the wide mouth, tousled hair, and grasping, outstretched hands of the Cihua pipiltin; she also wears down balls (symbols of sacrifice) in her hair. The "Coatlicue" statue from Coxcatlan in Puebla (Figure 15) is a standing manifestation of this being. Bare-breasted and wear ing a skirt of intertwined serpents and a serpent belt, the Coxca tlan "Coatlicue" stands with hands outstretched. Her skeletal face features a wide toothy grimace; strands of curling, tousled hair may once have been attached to the series of holes along the hair line. On her hands and feet, she wears mittens and boots that are the paws of a feline.9 Seler (1902-1923:2:790) saw this statue as an interpretive key to the colossal "Coatlicue" because of their similarities in posture, gesture, and costume. Iconographic correspondences with the "Coatlicues" are also found with the warrior goddess Itzpapalotl (Obsidian Butterfly), 7 Duran (1971:210, Plate 20) described and pictured Cihuacoatl as hav ing "a huge, open mouth and ferocious teeth. The hair on her head was long and bulky. " 8 Several of these sculptures are specifically identified as Cihuapipil tin by having one of five day signs (the days when they descend to earth) carved on the tops of their heads. 9 The day date 8 Cipactli (Crocodile) is carved on the back of her head, where it would have been covered by hair that was attached; its meaning is not understood (see Pasztory 1983:214).</page><page sequence="9">The "Coatlicues" at the Templo Mayor 197 Figure 15.

Itzpapalotl has the skeletal face and outwardly grasping claws associated with the other fierce women. She also has eagle feet, wears the distinctive wrist bands and leg bands of the "Coatlicues," and has the distinctive back apron, topped by a skull. In addition, she wears in her headdress the panache of two large eagle feathers that embellishes the back apron of the "Coatlicue." The particular feather panache is often a feature of the headdresses of warriors, for example, the eagle and jaguar war riors pictured in Codex Borbonicus trecena 13 and carved on the Malinalco drum, as well as some of the men on the Stone of the Warriors. An image of Itzpapalotl carved in relief on the top of a low broad box (Figure 17; Heyden 1974) has the same features as the Codex Borbonicus Itzpapalotl. Its wings, however, are clearly those of a butterfly. They are decorated with a loose web pattern stud ded with discs, the same pattern that distinguishes the serpents of the "Coatlicue." Iconographically, the varied features of these females come to gether in the image of Tzitzimime (demons who threatened to de scend from the heavens to devour humankind).

In addition, the Codex Magliabechiano and Codex Tudela Tzitzimime wear the "star skirt" and have a necklace of human hands and hearts. The Codex Ma gliabechiano image is pictured with a serpent extending down be tween its legs. Of all the images of identifiable supernaturals in the Aztec corpus, it is the Tzitzimitl that shares the most features with the monumental "Coatlicue" sculptures. THE TZITZIMIME Tzitzimime are celestial monsters. Alonso de Molina (1970:153, second pagination) translated Tzitzimitl as nombre de demonio, and other sixteenth-century chroniclers similarly characterized the Tzitzimime as monstrous, demonic beings. Cristóbal del Castillo (1991:150-151) called the Tzitzimime grandes fieras\ Chimalpa hin (1889:139) referred to them as tecuanime, tzitzimime (fierce beasts, tzitzimime). The Spanish friars, searching among the Aztec supernaturals for diabolical equivalents, seemed to have settled on the Tzitzimime as a close equivalent to their understanding of Sa tan and other "devilish" forces. Indeed, as Klein (2000) argued, the chroniclers emphasized the bellicose aspects of the Tzitzi mime and the group of female supernaturals that includes Coatli cue, Cihuacoatl, Cihuapipiltin, and Itzpapalotl. In this vein, Sahagun (1950-1982:1:64, 70) used tzitzimitl interchangeably as demon or devil: diablome, tzitzitzimi, culelti (devils, demons, evil spirits). The annotator of the Codex Magliabechia.no (75v) translated Tzi tzimitl as una saeta, perhaps because, like darts, these creatures descend from the sky to cause harm, or simply because mitl means arrow or dart. The Dominican lay brother Pedro de los Ríos characterized the Tzitzimime from a Christian perspective as celestial beings, spe cifically stars, who had sinned and were expelled from or fell from grace. In the Codex Telleriano-Remensis (4v), he annotated the illustration of the monthly feast of Quecholli, dedicated to Mix coatl, by noting:10 The feast of the descent of Mictlantecuhtli and of Zontemoc and the others; and thus they depict him [Mixcoatl] with the accoutrements of war because he brought it [war] into the world. Properly it should be called the fall of the demons, who they say were stars; and thus there are now stars in the sky that they call [by the] names they had, which are the following: (Yacate cuhtli, Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli, Ce Acatl Quetzalcoatl, Achitu metl, Xacopancalqui, Mixcoatl, Tezcatlipoca, Zontemoc)11 like god. They call them this name before they fell from heaven, and now they call them Tzitzimitl, which means monstrous or frightening thing [Quiñones Keber 1995:255]. In the Codex Ríos, Father de los Ríos, with his Catholic perspec tive evident, specifically associated the Tzitzimime with Mictlan tecuhtli, whom he characterized not as a neutral lord of the underworld but as god of Hell. According to the Codex Ríos: In that place of Hell they believed that there were four gods, or principal demons, also one which was superior, which was called Zitzimitl, that is Miquitlamtecotl, the great lord of hell. Yzpuz teque, the lame devil, that appears at the roads with feet of a rooster. Nestepehua, the spreader of ashes. Contenoque, the same as that which descends with the head lowered, alluding to the etymology that scholars give to the devil, in other words, fall ing, the motion they attribute to the similar lowering of the souls. This name and the second, which is Yzpuzteque, is one who appears in the streets, and is the same as Satan. ... It is said that these four gods, or demons, had women; likewise they say that they obtained these [women] from the sky, each one his own, although not as a wife but as a companion [Codex Ríos 1900:3r; author's translation from the Italian], The gods and their female counterparts are pictured on the facing page (Figure 19): Mictlantecuhtli, at the top, is glossed "Miqui tlan.tecotle, which is to say, Lord of the Inferno. Tzitzimitl, the same as Lucifer." Then follow, in descending order, the pairs of "Yxpuzteque," "Nextepeua," and "Contemoque" (Zon temoc). The males and females all have fierce grimacing facial expressions, outstretched grasping hands (not unlike claws), and 10 Quiñones Keber (1992:126) identified Pedro de los Ríos as the "third" annotator of the Codex Teileriano-Remensis. 11 The names in parentheses were themselves added by another anno tator (Quiñones Keber 1995:265).</page><page sequence="11">The "Coatlicues" at the Templo Mayor 199 Figure 19. Tzitzimime, from the Codex Ríos (Codex Vaticanus A) 2v [1979). wrist bands with paper streamers; the women have tousled hair. Sharing the generalized Tzitzimitl iconography, the Mictlantecuh tli and Zontemoc pairs also wear the braided back apron topped by a skull. The Historia de los mexicanos por sus pinturas (Garibay 1979:69) locates the Tzitzimime in the second level of the heav ens. The text describes them as fleshless, skeletal women who "are called tezauhcihuah and by the other name tzitzime," who would devour humankind at the time the world comes to an end. Thompson (1934:231) described the Tzitzimime as "stars, con stellations or planets in the heavens, who were considered under certain circumstances to be baneful." In this he was following the above descriptions in the Codex Telleriano-Remensis and Codex Ríos and those of the Nahua historian Fernando Alvarado Tezo zomc, who described the Tzitzimime as "angels of the air and sus tained of the sky," as planets, and as "gods of the air" (1878:358, 486,451). But the Tzitzimime were clearly malevolent beings. They would appear and descend on occasions like eclipses when the sky darkened (when stars would be visible), and they were said to de vour humankind (Seler 1963:1:139). Sahagun (1950-1982:7:2) warned that "If the eclipse of the sun is complete, it will be dark forever! The demons of darkness [tzitzitzimi] will come down; they will eat men!" Chimalpahin (1889:139) recorded the appearance of Tzitzimime during a total or near-total eclipse in the year 12 Rabbit (a.d. 1478), and the Codex Aubin (1893:77) recorded their appearance in 13 House (a.d. 1505); the Codex Aubin annalist painted the Tzitzimitl as the frontal face of a horned, hairy mon ster, like a European imp.12 Sahagún (1950-1982:8:2) did not men tion a specific year but noted that, during a mid-day eclipse of the sun in the reign of Ahuitzotl, the people feared that the Tzitzimime would descend to devour them. Tzitzimime also imperiled the world at the time of the New Fire Ceremony. Once all the fires had been extinguished and dark ness had set, the people were filled with dread that the demons might come. Sahagún (1950-1982:7:27) wrote how "it was claimed that if fire could not be drawn, then [the sun] would be destroyed forever; all would be ended; there would evermore be night; Nev ermore would the sun come forth. Night would prevail forever, and the demons of darkness [ tzitzitzimi ] would descend, to eat men." Pregnant women donned masks and were hidden in granaries for fear, if the new fire were not drawn, that they themselves would be changed into these human-eating beasts (Sahagún 1950-1982:7:27). On specific occasions, the Tzitzimime would descend on a par ticular mission. As Klein (1994:232-233,2000) and Quiñones Ke ber (1995:174) pointed out, the Histoyre du Mechique (Garibay 1979:107) preserves the legend of how the virgin goddess Maya huel was abducted by the wind god Ehecatl. Mayahuel's grand mother, who is described as an old goddess named Tzitzimitl, then gathered all the other goddesses who were called Tzitzimime; to gether they descended to earth to find Mayahuel, whereupon they tore her apart. Mayahuel's bones were then collected and buried, and from these bones sprouted the maguey plant. Tzitzimime blended with the Cihuapipiltin (Princesses) or Cihuateteo (Goddesses), the manifest souls of women who had died in childbirth, who, like the Tzitzimime, could descend from the heavens to afflict humankind (Seler 1902-1923:2:840-841). Having fought and lost the brave battle to bring a child into the world, the Cihuapipiltin are the functional equivalent of the souls of the warriors who died on the battlefield or on the sacrificial stone (Seler 1963:1:24-25; Nicholson and Keber 1983:67-68). They accompany the sun from its zenith to its setting in the west, after which, as Sahagún (1950-1982:6:163) explained, they would descend from the heavens to look for spindles, weaving sticks, and reed baskets, the equipment of women. Sahagún noted that "the demon, the devil [in tzitzimitl, in coleletli], deceived in this man ner," appearing like a Mocihuaquetzqui (a woman who has died with a child still in her womb; Sullivan 1966:90-91). The deified women "hate people" and "mock them"; they dwell at the cross roads ready to attack humans who might appear there, particularly children (Sahagún 1950-1982:1:19). On five days (1 Deer, 1 Rain, 1 Monkey, 1 House, 1 Eagle), the Cihuapipiltin were said to come down to earth to harm boys and girls, afflicting them with palsy, physical deformities, and other ailments (Sahagún 1950-1982:4:10, 41, 81, 93, 107; Seler 1992:3:154; Nicholson and Keber 1983:68). So dreaded were the descending Cihuapipiltin that parents kept their children inside and away from the doorways on those days (Sahagún 1950-1982:4:81). The Tzitzimime merged also with the goddess Cihuacoatl (Snake Woman), whom Sahagún (1950-1982:1:11) described as 12 The Codex Aubin (1893:72) also noted the eclipse in 12 Rabbit (a.d. 1478) but did not mention Tzitzimime.</page><page sequence="12">200 Boone "a savage beast and an evil omen. ... By night she walked weep ing, wailing; also was she an omen of war." Moreover, Cihua coatl was a female warrior, whose shield and costume were adorned with eagle feathers. The Song of Cihuacoatl calls her "The eagle, The eagle Quilaztli,. . . Our mother, War woman" (Sahagún 1950 1982:6:236). As Seler (1902-1923:2:1054) noted, Torquemada (1975:1:117) included among Cihuacoatl's names Quilaztli, Qua uhcihuatl (Eagle Woman), Yaocihuatl (Warrior Woman), and Tzi tzimicihuatl (which he translated as Infernal Woman). Durán (1971:210, 217) remarked that more men were slain in honor of Cihuacoatl than for any other, because she was always famished; he described her stone image with tousled hair and a huge open mouth with ferocious teeth. In the more secular realm, cihua coatl was also the title of a high political office, second in rank only to the huetlatoani (great king; Klein 1988). Itzpapalotl, like the supernatural Cihuacoatl, is both a warrior and a mother goddess; like the Cihuapipiltin, she is both a warrior and a celestial being (Heyden 1974). Itzpapalotl is also a Tzitzi mitl. In the Codex Telleriano-Remensis (18v), Pedro de los Ríos described her within the metaphor of the Garden of Eden, saying she was like "Eve after she sinned"; describing her as a child of Citlalicue (Stars Her Skirt) and Citlalatonac (Glowing Star), he saw her as one of the supernaturals (like the Tzitzimime) who ex isted in the paradise of Tamoanchan but, because they had sinned, fell from heaven. The (fifteenth) trecena she governs begins with the day 1 House, when the Cihuapipiltin descended. Seler (1963:1:137) described Itzpapalotl as an ancient Chichi mec earth goddess, the first sacrificial victim, and the first to die in war. She is mentioned at the very beginning of the Anales de Cuauhtitlan, before the year count is established and before the five ages had begun, as a supernatural who speaks to and advises the Chichimecs (Klein 2000). The Anales, the Leyenda de los Soles (Codex Chimalpopoca 1992:23, 27, 152, 212), and Muftoz Ca margo's Historia de Tlaxcala (1947:52) all include parts of a leg end about Itzpapalotl. Although the details differ from manuscript to manuscript, this ancient goddess is said to have eaten the 400 Mixcoa, after which she herself was impaled on a barrel cactus, killed with arrows, and burned by the Mixcoa men named either Mixcoatl or Xiuhnel and Mimich. The Leyenda de los Soles and the Historia de Tlaxcala relate that this happened soon after the Chichimecs left Chicomoztoc. The Song of Teteo Innan, recorded by Sahagún (1950-1982:2:226), also speaks of Itzpapalotl and this ancient story, mentioning "the goddess on the barrel cactus, [who] Is our mother, The obsidian butterfly [Itzpapalotl]," who is sought by Mimich "there on the desert plain." The name "Itzpapalotl" resonates associations of war and sac rifice, for warriors were trained to welcome death by the obsid ian blade or knife, which would transform them into celestial hummingbirds and butterflies. Sahagún (1950-1982:6:14) re corded a prayer used to seek aid in war, whereby the warrior was encouraged to "savor the fragrance, the sweetness of death by the obsidian knife. With his heart may he gladden Necoc tene, the ritual feathering, [the goddess] Itzpapalotl. May he long for the flowery death by the obsidian knife." One of the back de vices worn by Mexica warriors in battle was called ytzpapalotl; it was fashioned like a great obsidian butterfly (Sahagún 1993: RAH ms 87v). Along with these other fierce women, the Tzitzimime were con ceptualized as warriors. Tzitzimitl warrior costumes appear through out the tribute sections of the Matricula de Tributos and Codex Mendoza (Figure 20), where they are included as items paid to Figure 20. Tzitzimitl warrior costume, from the Codex Mendoza 23r (1992:4:51). Moctezuma13; a warrior's helmet fashioned like the head of a Tzi tzimitl is pictured in Sahagún's Primeros Memoriales (1993:RAH 73v; Anawalt in Codex Mendoza 1992:1:116, Appendix F). They have the skeletal head and tousled hair associated with earth, death, and star beings. The full-body costumes in the Matricula and Co dex Mendoza feature a horizontal slit in the chest, out of which hangs a stylized liver (the exposed liver characterizes the Tzitzi mitl in the Codices Magliabechiano [Figure 18] Tudela). Thus, the Tzitzimime ideologically embrace the parts of the realms and some of the attributes of the death gods (Mictlantecuh tli), the earth gods and goddesses (Tlaltecuhtli and the Cihuacoatl manifestations), and such other fierce and potentially harmful women as the Cihuapipiltin and Itzpapalotl. Tzitzimime are already dead warriors, occasionally pictured with their livers hanging out from a slit in their chests or drooping below their exposed ribs. They are earth beings who are associated with and who blend with Cihuacoatl, Teteo inan, and other old goddesses of the earth. They are also celestial beings, especially related to the darkened sky, where they appear like stars when the sun is absent. They embody the threat of the destroyed cosmos, for they are the ones who de voured humankind in an earlier age and who will do so again when the sun of the Fifth Age fails. As such, they are also relics of an earlier age, old supernaturals who were powerful even before the present age began. Klein (2000) argued that these supernaturals could be benevolent as well as malevolent by functioning as cre ator goddesses as well as destroyers. Tzitzimime are also beings that come in multiples. Except for the image painted in the Codex Magliabechiano and the Codex Tudela as an exemplar, the Tzitzimime are consistently mentioned in the plural, which means that they were fundamentally concep tualized this way. Like the monumental "Coatlicue" statues, there was never just one. 13 They are glossed as Tzitzimime costumes in the Matricula (3v, 4r).</page><page sequence="13">The "Coatlicues" at the Templo Mayor 201 TZITZIMIME AT THE TEMPLO MAYOR Important, and presumably large, sculptures of Tzitzimime were placed around the Templo Mayor. The Nahua historian Fernando Alvarado Tezozomoc and the Dominican priest Diego Durán, who were following the lost Crónica X, are our principal sources for this, and Andrés de Tapia contributes collaborative evidence. In Crónica mexicana, Alvarado Tezozomoc discussed several pro grams to renovate the Templo Mayor, notably those of Mocte zuma Ilhuicamina, Tizoc, and Ahuitzotl. The carving and finishing of Tzitzimime statues were apparently a significant part of each effort. In describing Moctezuma's renovation of the Templo Mayor, the chronicler relates: As they were finishing a god of stone, which was called Tzi tzimimec, Ilhuicatzitziquique, angles of air, sustainers of the sky . . .; with this it [the temple] was finished, where[upon] they had a solemn arietta and general dance in the great plaza of the pyramid of Huitzilopochtli [Alvarado Tezozomoc 1878:358], This sculpture was only one of a set, however, for Alvarado Tezo zomoc mentioned others. At this time, the capital city was awash in war prisoners brought back from successful campaigns in Oa xaca and the Coixtlahuaca Valley. Moctezuma desired a great sac rifice of these men to Huitzilopochtli, but his cihuacoatl (chief counselor) Tlacaelel responded: Sir, how can you do that? The bodies of the keepers and sus tainers of the sky, that are six, are not completely carved, nor their altars and bases [sentaderos], that each day 100 stonecut ters tezozonques go to carve; and it will dishonor us, that to this sacrifice all the lords of the towns have to come, and this is a great court and head of the world; let us abandon it until after all is completed, and until the xiuhtecatl [turquoise mirror of Huitzilopochtli] is finished. And with this agreement he ceased the sacrifice [Alvarado Tezozomoc 1878:361]. The slow pace of the renovation and the delay in the sacrifice ap parently bothered Moctezuma, for Alvarado Tezozomoc (1878:362) recorded that Tlacaelel then assured his monarch that he would personally oversee and hurry along the work of "the masons and stonecutters who are working to finish the great temple-pyramid, its hearth and bases of the other gods keepers and sustainers of the sky." Diego Durán, in his Historia, mentioned what must be the same statues when he described Moctezuma's renovation. He did not number them, but he added the detail that those called ilhuica tzitzquique were so numerous and were placed in such a way that they seemed to support the entire room.14 Great statues of Tzitzimime were also part of Tizoc's renova tion of the Templo Mayor. Alvarado Tezozomoc (1878:451) ex plained that: And then he [Tizoc] ordered that the great temple of the idol Huitzilopochtli should be given a coat of lime and he ordered the stonecutters next to finish working on the figures of their saints that were called Tzitzimime, that were, as they used to say, gods of the air that bring the rains, waters, thunderclaps, lightning and lightening bolts, and they had to be placed around Huitzilopochtli. A new sacrificial stone also was added at this time. Tizoc's successor, Ahuitzotl, takes credit for the last major, and probably the greatest, renovation of the Templo Mayor, which was completed in the year 8 Reed, a.d. 1487. Alvarado Tezozomoc wrote how, when the rebuilding was completed, Ahuitzotl's cihuacoatl ordered the new sculptures (and presumably any being reused) raised up to the temple. He summoned the ambassadors to go to Acolhuacan and Tlal huacpan. Tacuba and the other neighboring towns, to bid the Indians to come and raise up to the high temple the gods, signs and planets, that they called Tzitzimime, and they seated them around Huitzilopochtli [Alvarado Tezozomoc 1878:486]. At this time, they placed a resplendent mirror (xiuhtezcatl) in front of Huitzilopochtli. Alvarado Tezozomoc (1878:486) mentioned that they also added a statue of the god's sister Coyolxauhqui and im ages of the ancient ancestors who came from Aztlan. Although Durán (1967:22:333, 1992:328) provided only a few particulars about Ahuitzotl's renovation of a.d. 1487, he specifi cally cited the Tzitzimime sculptures. When he explained how the stonecutters began to carve idols for the Templo Mayor, he men tioned the pointed sacrificial stone, an image of Coyolxauhqui next to it, and two statues on the corners of the pyramid. He then added: "They set up two stone beasts [bestiones] that they called tzitzi mites."15 Figure 21 hints at the placement of these great figural sculptures, for it pictures distorted human faces on the door jambs of the twin temples. Later when Durán (1967:2:344-345, 1992:338-340) described the bloody sacrifices that served to dedicate the Templo Mayor, the accompanying painting (Figure 22) illustrates the cult image in Huitzilopochtli's shrine as a monstrous, horned being, one so large that its feet extend down to the first step below the platform. It has claws and talons for hands and feet, an open and grimacing mouth, a protruding tongue, what looks like a smoking mirror at the temple, writhing serpents about its head, a necklace of what look like hearts, and two long serpents spinning outward from its lower body. The cult image of Tlaloc has claws for hands and feet, faces at the elbows and knees, a serpent tail, and a nearly unread able face whose nose and fanged mouth are formed by curling ser pents. With the exception of Tlaloc*s face, which is characteristic of that deity, most of these elements are features of either the "Coatlicue" sculptures or the broader complex of supernaturals to which the "Coatlicue" statues belong. 14 Duran (1967:2:229) here spoke of both estatuas de piedra and bestiones, which Heyden (Duran 1992:227) translated as "[architectural] support," and his text seems to blend the two. Duran, like Cortés (1986: 105-106), described the interior of the temple as being filled with relief carvings. Heyden (Durán 1992:227), in a footnote, cited me as having "sug gested [in a personal communication] that the Coatlicue and Yolotlicue statues may have been supports of this type." Unfortunately this is incor rect. I do think the great statues are similar to these ilhuicatzitzquique, but not that they are supports. I investigated this latter possibility in 1973 and found that it was not possible, as explained in n. 15. 15 Although, Ramírez (Durán 1867-1880:1:345) noted that bestión is an architectural term meaning "pilaster" or "atlantid,"' a supporting mem ber that takes the form of a human or animal; the term should be read in this context as a grotesque animal figure of significant size and solidity, like the "Coatlicues." The "Coatlicue" was never an atlantid per se be cause its top surface (revealed in photographs kindly taken for me in 1973 by José de los Reyes Medina) is fully carved with the same webbed pat tern, and the area where the upper lips of the two serpents meet is both too shallow and too undamaged to be a structural joint.</page><page sequence="14">202 Boone Figure 21. Templo Mayor, Diego Durán's Historia Folio 126v (photo courtesy Biblioteca Nacional, Madrid]. On the outside of the twin temples, the two hairy imps that float in the air and hold onto the sides of the shrines also have claws instead of hands and feet and what may be serpents around their faces. They are presented as already-sacrificed creatures, with their heart or liver exposed through an open slit in their chest. These cult figures and imps share some features with the "Coatlicue" statues. This is not to say that Durán's artist accurately rendered the Templo Mayor as it was renovated by Ahuitzotl, or even as it ap peared at the time of the conquest. Durán, as a man of his times, was influenced by early colonial analogies between the Aztec gods and the European devil, and his artists must have been influenced by the corresponding visual analogies (Boone 1989:67-71). The artist who painted this illustration of the Templo Mayor (Fig ure 22) surely drew from the European tradition of diabolical imagery—including monstrous faces with grimacing mouths and forked tongues, horns, serpents, tails, and claws—to describe the cult images at the Templo Mayor. After all, this was the illustra tion that introduced Durán's chapter on the sacrifices that marked the temple's dedication in a.d. 1487. However, most of the visual features that characterize these painted images do correspond to elements that characterize the Tzitzimime and other fierce fe males in Aztec iconography. Durán's artist clearly drew from a preexisting, indigenous visual foundation, one that included the memory of "Coatlicue'Mike images at the Templo Mayor. Durán (1992:227) wrote that these statues, having been fixed to the cor ners of the royal palace, were visible (in a.d. 1570) when he was writing. Andrés de Tapia brings us even closer to Huitzilopochtli's shrine and the great statues there at the time of the Spanish invasion. In his Breve relación de la conquista, the conqueror described the Templo Mayor and the images associated with it. He character ized the image of Huitzilopochtli as a figure made of seed dough (this would be a tzoalli image [Boone 1989:46-47]) and noted that it was accompanied by other large stone statues: Outside the hollow wall [apparently the shrine itself] were two idols on large stone bases the height of a measuring rod. The idols were nearly the height of three measuring rods, and the girth of an ox. They were of polished granite covered with mother-of-pearl. . . . Over this they used a glue in the form of a paste to incrust gold ornamentation, and designs of men, ser</page><page sequence="15">The "Coatlicues" at the Templo Mayor 203 O.oo OOOOQ oo o r.ttO O q OQ QQQOQ^ ' Figure 22. Templo Mayor, Diego Durán's Historia Folio 131v [photo courtesy Biblioteca Nacional, Madrid], pents, birds, and other figures made of large and small tur quoises, emeralds, and amethysts, so that all of the mother-of pearl was covered except in some places where they left it to make a design with the stones. These idols wore thick gold ser pents, and for necklaces some ten or twelve human hearts made of gold. For faces they had gold masks with mirror eyes, and at the nape of the neck hung another face like a human head with out flesh [Fuentes 1963:41].16 Jorge Gurria Lacroix (1978) argued that these massive granite idols exist today as the "Coatlicue" and "Yolotlicue," which are roughly the right size, are of andesite, have necklaces of alternating hearts and hands, have a skull attached at the back, and are girded in serpent belts. I previously thought that this identification ulti mately failed because the gold, the jewels, and the other features of Tapia's statues are not found on the "Coatlicues" (Boone 1989:47). I now realize that I was taking Tapia too literally, and that Gurria Lacroix is right. If we step back from a literal inter pretation of Tapia and consider his description in light of the text by Alvarado Tezozomoc and the illustrations and the text of Durán, it is clear that large Tzitzimitl-like statues were placed around the Templo Mayor. Tapia, like Durán, mentioned two, but there must have been others, perhaps on the sides or back. Tapia and Durán's artist, I suggest, conflated a number of Az tec cult images to achieve almost archetypal monsters, ones that were both horrific and tantalizing to the European audience to which their works were directed. Their presentations are founded on the memory of huge anthropomorphic/zoomorphic statues at the Tem plo Mayor; these statues were of stone, had nonhuman faces, and were girded in great serpents, and they were adorned with heart necklaces and pendent skulls. Durán's artist recorded the fanged faces at the joints and recalled more serpent features (Figure 22). The gold, mother-of-pearl, and precious and semiprecious stones that Tapia emphasized may well be embellishments that the con queror invented or mentally borrowed from other images and added 16 Although Tapia's relation was not published until the late nine teenth century, it was available to Francisco López de Gomara (secretary to Cortés), who followed Tapia almost verbatim in describing the cult images at the Templo Mayor. López de Gómara (1943:1:244-245), how ever, gave priority to the two stone images and identified them as Huitzi lopochtli and Tezcatlipoca. His description then became the standard for its time, repeated by Francisco Cervantes de Salazar, Bernal Diaz del Castillo, Antonio de Herrera, Bartolomé de las Casas, and Juan de Torque mada (for discussion, see Boone 1989:47-51).</page><page sequence="16">204 Boone to reinforce the exotic richness of Aztec cult images. Tapia and Durán's artist may have emphasized those features that they con sidered the most important about these statues, that is, the features that qualified the statues as fearsome and unfathomable. Tapia stressed the rare and precious materials, whereas Durán's artist in sisted on a strong analogy with the European devil. HUITZILOPOCHTU AND THE TZITZIMIME Alvarado Tezozomoc and Durán identified the colossal statues that were placed around Huitzilopochtli at the Templo Mayor as Tzi tzimime. As celestial demons and stars, usually conceptualized as females and blending with other fierce earth and heavenly super naturals, the Tzitzimime promised to descend from the heavens to devour humankind if the sun were to fail. We must ask ourselves how these sculptures functioned ideologically within the overall iconographic program at the Templo Mayor. They clearly were sig nificant elements in the program, because their creation was a ma jor concern during several renovations. Unfortunately, the paintings and alphabetic texts that have come down to us from the early Colonial period do not easily and unequivocally tell us why the Tzitzimime were set up at the Templo Mayor. We have no equiv alent to the legend of the birth of Huitzilopochtli, which explains Coyolxauhqui's existence so readily. There are only suggestive hints in the statues' iconography and in the words of the chroniclers. The statues are large and mas sively formed. Because Alvarado Tezozomoc (1878:358) called them "angels of the air and sustainers of the sky" and Durán (1992:227) agreed they are "sustainers of the sky," they may sim ply function as sky bearers, metaphorically supporting the heav ens around Huitzilopochtli as the sun. In this case, there may have been four of them, although Alvarado Tezozomoc (1878:361) re ported on six that were carved for Moctezuma Ilhuicamina's ren ovation. But the "Coatlicues" are too iconographically complex to be merely sky bearers. A key to their identity, I feel, lies in the year date, 12 Reed, carved between the shoulder blades of the "Coatlicue" and "Yo lotlicue." This year is not well known for having strong ideolog ical significance, but a passage in the, Anales de Cuauhtitlan implies that it is the year in which the second Age or Sun began: "The second age is told and related to be the fifth sun, or age. 12 Reed. 13 Flint. 1 House. . . ." Later, the Anales described what happened in this sun: "4 Jaguar is the day sign of the second sun that there was, called Jaguar Sun. It happened that the sky collapsed then, and the sun did not continue. It happened at midday. Then there was darkness, and while it was dark, the people were eaten" (Co dex Chimalpopoca 1992:25, 26). Other texts differ in the order and detail of the suns. The Ley enda de los Soles (Codex Chimalpopoca 1992:142) described this jaguar sun as the first of the series of suns and stated that the people were eaten by "jaguars" and/or "man eaters." The His toyre du Mechique (Garibay 1979:104) assigned this sun, which it called Yohualtonatiuh (Dark or Night Sun), to the third posi tion and stated that humankind was devoured by "fierce beasts, that are called [blank!], that is to say giants." Because of the Leyenda de los Soles text, most scholars (e.g., Caso 1958:15; Nich olson 1971:398-399) have asserted that humankind was de voured by jaguars, but the other two texts make it much more likely that the ancient stories told of people being eaten by Tzi tzimime, who are elsewhere referred to as fierce beasts and man eaters and who appear in times of darkness when the sun fails. The Anales also indicated that this second sun is related concep tually to the Fifth Sun, when humans are destined to be eaten by Tzitzimime. If we can tie the year-date 12 Reed on the back of the colossal "Coatlicues" with this earlier sun, when humankind was de voured by Tzitzimime, the great stone statues become both the ancient man-eaters and those who threaten the present, Fifth Age. This link is supported by the iconography of the monoliths, which relates them to powerful women who existed in earlier times— such as Coatlicue, Itzpapalotl, and the Tzitzimitl grandmother of Mayahuel—and to other potentially dangerous spirits of the present—such as Cihuacoatl and the Cihuapipiltin. A distinguishing and puzzling feature of the "Coatlicues" is that they are beheaded and dismembered. Their heads and hands, those very parts of the anatomy that do the killing and devouring, have been severed. This puts them in the company of conquered women such as Coyolxauhqui, who have been defeated by Huitzilo pochtli. My sense is that the great statues represent Tzitzimime that have been defeated by Huitzilopochtli, the sun, whose appear ance at dawn, after eclipses, and after the New Fire has been drilled for a 52-year cycle, effectively vanquishes the celestial demons of the night. Their placement around the status of Huitzilopochtli at the Templo Mayor demonstrated to the Aztec observer that Huitzi lopochtli has conquered and rendered powerless the forces of de struction, the Tzitzimime, that threaten humankind in the Fifth Age. Like the Coyolxauhqui reliefs, the great "Coatlicue" statues af firm Huitzilopochtli's essential superiority over all other gods and forces. In summary, the colossal sculpture known as the "Coatlicue" is not a single cult image but one of a larger set of statues that were placed around the image of Huitzilopochtli at the Templo Mayor. The iconographic elements that characterize these monumental stone images show them as belonging to the broad category of powerful, potentially dangerous, supernatural women that in cludes Coatlicue, Cihuacoatl, Itzpapalotl, and the Cihuapipiltin. Within this category, the sculptures can be identified as Tzitzi mime, celestial demons belonging to both earlier ages and this Fifth Age, who threaten to descend and devour humankind if the sun fails to reappear after spells of darkness. The Tzitzimime are the very beings that Huitzilopochtli, as the sun god, must forestall and render impotent. The Aztec sculptors carved them as decapitated and dismembered creatures, whose presence at the Templo Mayor signaled Huitzilopochtli's ultimate superiority and victory. RESUMEN La colosal escultura "Coatlicue" ha sido usualmente interpretada como una representación de la supernatural Coatlicue (La de la Falda de Serpientes), quien dio a luz a Huitzilopochtli, el dios patrón de los mexicas. También ha sido identificada como la imagen de culto de Cihuacoatl (Mujer Serpi ente), o de Tlaltecuhtli (Señor de la Tierra). Este trabajo ofrece una lectura alternativa de la monumental estatua, una que reconoce la existencia de</page><page sequence="17">The "Coatlicues" at the Templo Mayor 205 por lo menos tres "Coalicues" casi idénticas, y por lo tanto recontextualiza al monumento como parte de un conjunto más grande. La iconografía de estas tres magníficas mujeres de piedra sugiere que su identidad es Tzitzi mime, demonios celestiales que se pensaba descenderían para devorar a la humanidad si el sol no aparecía. De acuerdo a los cronistas mexicanos, un escuadrón de estos terroríficos monolitos dominaba el programa escultural del Templo Mayor. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This article has its origins in a paper I wrote in 1973 while a graduate student at the University of Texas at Austin, under the guidance of Ter ence Grieder. That paper, "A Re-evaluation of the Coatlicue," drew on research in the Sala Mexica, bodega, and garden of the Museo Nacional de Antropología. I am grateful to the late Ignacio Bernal for allowing me free access to the Museo's bodega and garden, to José de los Reyes Me dina for special photographs, and to Doris Heyden who provided a wel come haven in Mexico for so many U.S. graduate students. That paper was then presented at the Mid American College Art Association meeting in November 1973 and has subsequently circulated among a number of Aztec art historians and anthropologists. Since that original paper has been used and cited in the literature for 25 years, I thought it time to rework it and recontextualize it in the light of recent scholarship. For this present work, I am grateful especially to Cecelia Klein and Dana Leib sohn for valuable suggestions. Klein critiqued the earlier paper also, and her recent article on the Tzitzimime (2000) challenged me to reopen the "Coatlicue" question. My thanks go also to Emily Umberger, Esther Pasz tory, Joanne Pillsbury, and Lisa DeLeonardis for help with research ques tions. For many years Felipe Solís Olguin has shared with me his impressive command of Aztec iconography and has graciously opened the doors of the Museo Nacional de Antropología to me; I appreciate his generosity.
