<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Werner Wolf University of Graz, Austria Aesthetic Illusion as an Effect of Fiction 1. Introduction: Aesthetic Illusion as Reception Phenomenon  and as a Problem for Narratology “THE CORRECTIONS is the whole package . . . You will laugh, wince, groan,  weep [. . .] and be reminded of why you read serious fiction in the first place.”  This is one of the blurb advertisements of Jonathan Franzen’s bestseller The Cor- rections (2001), praise which is basically an elaboration of the frequently-used  publicity formula “a moving fiction.” We are all familiar with both such promises  of “pleasures that [. . .] fiction affords” (cover of The Corrections) and with the  pleasures themselves, indeed so familiar that we rarely enquire into the state of  mind that renders such responses to fiction possible. Such reactions indicate a deep  emotional involvement—usually an empathy with central characters—and, unless  we suffer from a delusion, they presuppose aesthetic illusion: a feeling of being  recentered in a possible world as if it were (a slice of) life, a feeling that prevails  in spite of the fact, and our latent awareness of it, that this impression is triggered  by a “mere” artefact. Aesthetic illusion is an attractive effect of the reading process and a common  reception phenomenon. In contemporary culture it can be encountered as a response  to a plethora of traditional as well as new media, such as the visual arts, the theater,  opera, comics, radio drama, film and computer-created virtual realities (provided  the recipient maintains some distance), and one must not forget fiction, which con- tinues to have an important share in the illusion-creating media. Curiously, while  the cultural presence of aesthetic illusion is quite massive, it has received only  modest attention in recent research. The most influential and best study in English  is still Ernst Gombrich’s Art and Illusion (1960), while the first major collective  volume in English dedicated to literary illusionism consists of the proceedings of  a conference held fifteen years ago (Burwick and Pape). One should also mention  the possible-worlds research of Marie-Laure Ryan (Possible Worlds), who, instead  of “aesthetic illusion,” speaks of “recentering” (21) and “immersion” (22). German  narratology has produced several pioneering studies on aesthetic illusion as an effect  of fiction. Werner Strube’s unpublished dissertation deserves to be mentioned here,  as well as the book publications by Eckhard Lobsien and Manfred Smuda.1 In my  Style: Volume 38, No. 3, Fall 2004 325 </page> <page sequence="2"> 326 Werner Wolf own monograph Ästhetische Illusion I was able to draw upon all of these studies.  This book and the critical response it has elicited, as well as my other studies on  aesthetic illusionism in Shakespeare, lyric poetry, and twentieth-century fiction  form the basis of the present essay. On closer inspection, the hesitation of contemporary literary scholars in engag- ing in a discussion of aesthetic illusion is understandable, for it is a particularly  elusive and hence problematic phenomenon: strictly speaking, it is a reception  phenomenon located in the recipient’s mind, and what goes on there is actually  beyond the scope of philology. Therefore there are serious methodological limitations  to any purely philological theory of aesthetic illusion—including the present one.  Yet this does not mean that literary theorists must have recourse to mere specula- tion. Apart from introspection—which may, of course, be highly flawed, but can at  least provide some clues as to which devices trigger asthetic illusion and to what  degree—the principal means are reception testimonies by others. These include  evidence from aestheticians and their theories from Aristotle’s Poetics onwards,  besides comments on reception experiences by the general recipient, and last, but  not least, clues deducible from the texts themselves. Such clues are particularly  relevant if they play with the expectation of aesthetic illusion and undermine it,  notably through self-reflexive metadevices. Although neither textual clues nor read- ers’ testimonies can yield reliable and detailed information on mental processes,  such evidence can at least indicate the presence or absence of aesthetic illusion in  certain cases; besides, in contrast to the findings of neuropsychology, cognition  research, and empirical literary studies, it can also shed light on the past. Starting from such evidence, statements can be made concerning individual  texts, text groups, periods, and cultural contexts in which aesthetic illusion appears  to be, or have been, experienced with particular intensity or frequency. Such a  survey then permits us to select a corpus of typically illusionist texts, which in turn  enables the theorist to describe the factors and conditions that are involved in the  emergence of aesthetic illusion. This corpus moreover highlights typical features  that recur in illusionist works and furnishes a basis from which to deduce underly- ing principles that contribute to the production of these features. The elucidation  of such general features and principles will be the main focus of what follows. As  a preliminary part of my presentation, I will, however, first describe the nature,  properties, and variants of aesthetic illusion as opposed to various states of delu- sion, and will then proceed to discuss the factors that contribute to the emergence  of aesthetic illusion. After this, four typical features of illusionist works shall be  detailed, followed by an analysis of six basic “principles of illusion-making” that  inform such works and contribute to their illusionist effect. To conclude this essay  I will remark on some of the functions of aesthetic illusion in literary works, and  then turn to discuss aesthetic illusion’s corollary, i.e., the breaking of illusion. I  close with some desiderata for further research. Two caveats apply, though. The first refers to the schematic and theoretical  </page> <page sequence="3"> Aesthetic Illusion as an Effect of Fiction 327 nature of the following remarks: aesthetic illusion is too complex a subject to be  treated here in more than a cursory way. As the history of illusionism will have to be  excluded, and as only very few examples can be given, I will illustrate some points  by referring to just one well-known short short story: Julio Cortázar’s “”Continui- dad de los parques” (1956 [cited in online translation]). This frame tale is actually  a metafictional demonstration of the workings of aesthetic illusion and leads to  an ambivalent result, as it elicits such illusion within the fictional world and, to a  certain extent, also in the real reader, but eventually lays it bare as a problematic,  perhaps even dangerous effect. The second caveat refers to possible extensions of  my theses. I would welcome it if my description of aesthetic illusion were applicable  to genres and media beyond fiction as well as to historical periods other than the  ones focused on in this contribution. However, although other genres and media  are not excluded in principle, I will limit the scope of the present narratological  essay to fiction published in the Western world since the seventeenth century, for  it is from this period onwards that testimonies of the existence of aesthetic illusion  can be observed with some frequency. 2. What is “Aesthetic Illusion”? As a start, the concept of aesthetic illusion should be clarified beyond the  provisional definition given above. So what is aesthetic illusion? Most theoreti- cians and testimonies point to the following constituents—most of which are also  illustrated in the frame of Cortázar’s “Continuity of Parks,” in which a fictitious  reader is shown in the grip of intense aesthetic illusion. A. Aesthetic illusion is a mental state triggered by concrete objects or “artefacts”  such as texts, performances, artworks, etc. (For Cortázar’s diegetic reader, it is a  novel about a man who entertains an adulterous relationship to a married woman  and, supported by her, sets out to kill her husband.) This mental state emerges  during a process of reception but is not always limited to it, as “after-images”  may linger on for a while. (Cortázar’s story relies on such an effect, as its terminal  metalepsis, the paradoxical suggestion that the diegetic reader is killed by the hero  of the hypodiegetic novel the reader is about to finish, is not actually narrated but  exists only in the real recipient’s imagination after he has read the last words of  the story.) Since it depends on external illusionist objects, aesthetic illusion differs  from hallucination, which emerges without such objects. B. On the other hand, aesthetic illusion shares with hallucinations (and also  dreams) a vivid impression that can be described as a feeling of being “recentered”  or “immersed” in an imaginative possible world (cf. Ryan, Possible Worlds 21- 22). This means that one does not just watch this world from a distance but has the  impression of being present in it and, above all, of experiencing it in a way similar  to that in which one experiences life. (Cortázar’s reader feels that he is “witness”  to what is going on in the story.) Aesthetic illusion thus has an essentially expe- riential quality2 and is moreover dependent on the “verisimilitude” or probability  </page> <page sequence="4"> 328 Werner Wolf of the possible world.  C. As opposed to hallucination and other illusionlike states, the experience elic- ited by aesthetic illusion has a characteristic “as-if” quality: the illusion-producing  object creates a feeling of verisimilar lifelikeness, but not of life tout court. In fact,  immersion, in aesthetic illusion, is never total. This is why aesthetic illusion is  fundamentally a bipolar phenomenon: a dominant experiential immersion is always  counterbalanced by a latent, culturally acquired awareness of the fictionality of  the perceived possible world (objects). This ambivalence is also expressed by the  collocation “aesthetic illusion” itself, in which “illusion,” strictly speaking, refers  to immersion, and “aesthetic” to the distance that is essential to approaching works  of art in the Western tradition. This distance is well expressed in Cortázar’s story.  While the diegetic reader “disengag[es] himself line by line from the things around  him,” he yet “at the same time feel[s] his head rest comfortably on the green velvet  of the chair” and thus—at least in the initial stage of reception—remains conscious  of his being (also) centered in a real-life situation. For systematic reasons, and also in the face of repeated criticism of illusion- ist art and illusionism in the media (attacks that usually rest on a confusion of  “aesthetic illusion” with “delusion”), it is crucial to emphasize two things. On the  one hand, aesthetic illusion (“poetic faith”) is a “willing suspension of disbelief”  (Coleridge 169); characteristically, Cortázar’s reader “let[s] himself be absorbed”  (my emphasis). On the other hand, rational distance is a necessary constituent of it.  Thanks to this distance, an “aesthetic illusion” is actually not an “illusion” but an  “experiential pseudo-illusion.” Moreover, the conjunction of distance and willful  immersion distinguishes aesthetic illusion from related states in real life as well as  from some artefact-induced states of mind. Such related states in real life include  “illusions” and “delusions” as misconceptions (cognitive errors) and also several  experiential states: sensory misperceptions, hallucinations, dreams, and the like.  These states differ from aesthetic illusion in that they are entered upon involuntarily  and lack the required distance between the experiencer and the fictional world.  As for related, artefact-induced “delusionary” states that are equally nonaesthetic  because they are involuntary and nondistanced, there is, first, a nonexperiential,  “referential illusion” (or “delusion”) in the sense of an erroneous attribution of a  reality status to something fictional or invented. In the visual arts, such referential  mistakes are sometimes playfully caused by trompe-l’oeil techniques, in literature,  by “fictions of authenticity” or by particularly convincing imitations of factual  texts. A second, artefact-induced delusion frequently occurs parallel to, or as a  consequence of, such referential delusions: namely an experiential delusion without  distance. This state, according to Oliver Grau’s critical analysis, is the ultimate aim  of the development of ever more sophisticated strategies of total immersion, the  most advanced form of which to date is that of computerized virtual realities. Yet,  even simple artefacts can produce similar delusions under certain circumstances,  as Cervantes illustrates in an amusing metafictional scene of Don Quixote (Part  </page> <page sequence="5"> Aesthetic Illusion as an Effect of Fiction 329 2, ch. 26), where Don Quixote is so overwhelmed by an injustice represented in  a puppet show that he smashes the puppets in anger. As this example shows, an  experiential delusion is a condition in which a recipient is so much in the grip of a  possible world that he may even feel compelled to interfere with it and experiences  it not as if it were life but as (a slice of) life.3 When either of these artefact-induced delusions is combined with a latent  distance, it becomes a variant of aesthetic illusion: There is, first, the center of  aesthetic illusion, as already mentioned: “experiential (pseudo-)illusion.” Don  Quixote’s exaggerated reaction is ridiculous because it mimics aesthetic illusion  in its most characteristic component, experiential immersion, but lacks its other  component, aesthetic distance. In this Don Quixote resembles Cortázar’s diegetic  reader, who in the latter part of his reception also increasingly forgets about the  distance he initially felt and apparently applies what he is just reading to himself. The episode from Don Quixote also exemplifies a distorted form of a second,  albeit subsidiary variant of aesthetic illusion: “referential (pseudo-)illusion.” This  is a state in which the recipient indulges in the idea that an artefact may render  reality—without, however, being entirely convinced of it, as Don Quixote unfor- tunately is. The secondary, optional status of this “referential pseudo-illusion” can  be seen in science fiction: SF texts can also create aesthetic illusion, but if they do,  this illusion is of an experiential nature only (since the genre excludes a real-life  reference).4 Unless otherwise stated, the term “aesthetic illusion” or even “illusion”  tout court will therefore be used from now on to designate this main, experiential  variant. The relative position of aesthetic illusion (and its two variants) as opposed  to related phenomena in the realm of real-life as well as artefact-induced “illusions”  and illusionlike states is illustrated in figure 1. D. In the main, the experiential form of aesthetic illusion and the degree to  which its constituents, immersion and distance are realized are not stable but can  vary historically, individually and even during the reception of one and the same  artefact. (The real readers of Cortázar’s story are meant to experience aesthetic  illusion for a while, but also, at least at the end, to disengage themselves from it,  namely when becoming aware of the textual strategy that has led them into the trap  of the suggested metalepsis.) Aesthetic illusion may thus be represented as being  located on a scale between the two poles of immersion and distance, maintaining,  however, a relative proximity to “immersion.” The poles themselves are excluded,  since both total distance and total immersion do not yet, or no longer, qualify as  aesthetic illusion.  E. As in the blurbs for The Corrections quoted above, the quasi-experience  of (a) reality that is typical of aesthetic illusion is frequently described in (mostly  pleasurable) emotional terms (Cortázar’s narrator speaks of a “perverse pleasure,”  which the diegetic reader feels during the reception process). This points to the  fact that the dominant part of this kind of “illusion” is inextricably linked to the  recipient’s emotions. It is thus no coincidence that the first characterization of the  </page> <page sequence="6"> 330 Werner Wolf “Illusion” and “illusion”-like mental states In Real Life Artefact-Induced illusion and illusion as misper- hallucination, artefact-induced artefact- aesthetic illusion delusion as ception dream referential delu- induced experi- misconception sion (mistaking ential delusion  an artefact for (experiencing  reality) an artefact as  reality) referential (pseudo-) illu- experiential sion (perceiving a possible (pseudo-)illusion world as if it were reality) (experiencing a possible  world as if it were [a  slice of] life distance illusion of distance immersion (latent) reality (latent) Fig. 1: Aesthetic illusion and related concepts hypodiegetic novel in Cortázar’s text, “the sordid dilemma of the hero and heroine,”  is an evaluative and emotional one. On account of this quality, aesthetic illusion  differs notably from the reader’s residual awareness of fictionality, which is rational,  but also from a scholarly approach to a work of art in which its structures, themes,  and meanings are analyzed. The rational distance implied in aesthetic illusion is  not, however, totally opposed to immersion, but even supports it to some extent:  for it is mainly responsible for the paradox that during the operation of aesthetic  illusion even unpleasant emotions such as fear and horror can be experienced as  pleasurable. F. As for further specifications of the nature of aesthetic illusion in fiction, the  following can be gathered from most statements of relevant experiences: for an  illusionist entering into the worlds provided by artefacts, these worlds appear to  have a quasi-sensory quality. Owing to the paramount importance of visual per- ception in most human beings, visual “imagination” here seems to predominate.  (Cortázar’s reader testifies to this, when his mental “images [. . .] t[ake] on color  and movement.”) Other sensory experiences, in particular aural “imaginings” of  voices, noises, and music, can also play a role. Summarizing what we have said so far, but in part anticipating the ensuing  </page> <page sequence="7"> Aesthetic Illusion as an Effect of Fiction 331 argument, the following general definition of aesthetic illusion can be given: aes- thetic illusion is a pleasurable mental state that emerges during the reception of an  artefact (or, where applicable, a performance) from the conjunction of factors that,  as will be detailed below, are located in the artefact (performance) itself, in the  recipient, and in certain cultural and historical contexts. This mental state consists  in an impression of variable intensity, of being imaginatively immersed in a pos- sible world that is constituted, or referred to, by the artefact, and of experiencing  this world in a mainly sensory (visual) and emotional way as if it were a slice of  life. In spite of a dominant and willed feeling of experiential immersion, aesthetic  illusion, as opposed to delusion, is characterized by a latent rational distance. This  distance is a consequence of the culturally acquired awareness of the fictional  quality of the artefact (performance) and of the illusionary status of the dominant  effect induced by it. The “narrative illusion” elicited by fiction, which is our focus here,5 is a  special case of aesthetic illusion and must be further specified. The first, obvious  modification is its being induced by a particular medium: mostly, as in the case of  “Continuity of Parks,” by the written text of a fictional narrative, but oral transmis- sion also plays a role. As a rule, both variants of storytelling exclusively use the  symbolic medium of language and to this extent differ from iconic media, such  as the visual arts, dramatic performances, and film. The apparent directness of an  illusion-inducing presence in the iconic media—and a privileging of the model of  dramatic illusion—has led some critics into misconceptions about narrative illusion.  Murray Krieger, for instance, has it that “before we can, through make-believe,  be referred to any possible ‘real world’ out there,” the primary object of narrative  illusion is what he calls a “shadow genre”: “the apparently factual or referential  sort of text that [. . .] the novel is making-believe it is,” such as historiography,  real-life autobiography, etc. (309). This sadly underrates the power of experiential  immersion in fiction and erroneously implies that narrative illusion is necessarily  dependent on referential illusion. While eliciting the latter kind of illusion may  have had some justification in the period of the “rise of the novel,” this “lure” has  lost its importance after the novel had been established as a genre in its own right.6 The second specification of narrative illusion is linked to a second confusion  about its nature. It has recently arisen in German criticism. I have in mind Ansgar  Nünning’s contention that the “primary illusion” of fiction is centered not on the  story, and hence on the (intra)diegetic level, but on the communicational scenario  of the extradiegetic narrator (see “‘Great Wits’” 69-73, and “Mimesis” 19-20).  While I do not deny that there is such a thing as an Erzählillusion (the illusion of  a narratorial presence) in some cases, e.g., in Tristram Shandy, I strongly object to  its alleged centrality or primacy in typically illusionist fiction. Nünning’s proposal  not only testifies to a problematic privileging of the iconic representation of voice  over the symbolic representation of characters and action, it also blatantly con- tradicts most reading experiences. For what we tend to remember, even of stories  </page> <page sequence="8"> 332 Werner Wolf transmitted by an overt, “authorial” or first-person narator, is mostly the story, and  not the narrator—precisely because it was the storyworld that had us in its grip. In  addition, dismissing the storyworld as the principal object of narrative illusion—and  the center of narrativity—would create unnecessary problems about narratives with  covert narrators, as encountered in Cortázar’s story (which would then have to be  seen as eliciting only a weaker, secondary kind of illusion?). Denying the primacy  of the story-centered illusion would also dissociate novels from films and other  narrative media in a problematic way, and would require us to assume a transferal  of the focus of aesthetic illusion in cases of intermedial transpositions, e.g., from  novel to film. There is yet another reason why the narrator cannot be the principal object of  illusion: independently of his or her potential lifelikeness, the narrator is always  a transmitting agency, an element of discourse. The lifelike quality that aesthetic  illusion generally possesses according to all testimonies emerges not only from a  certain correspondence between the “inventory” of illusionist possible worlds and  real-life objects and concepts, but also from a fundamental analogy between the  experience induced by illusionist artefacts and the basic concepts and schemata  that guide the perception and experience of reality (I have called this the illusion- ist “analogy thesis”).7 Among the conditions of real-life experience there is the  “natural” belief that we perceive reality in an unmediated (and, we love to as- sume, undistorted) way—that is, we bracket the actual mediacy of all perception.  Accordingly, aesthetic illusion, whether narrative or not, also implies the feeling  of being present in the possible world in a “natural,” unmediated way. This is  indeed corroborated by the impression that Cortázar’s diegetic reader has of be- ing a “witness” of the storyworld. In fact, during an illusionist reading, the actual  mediation through the level of discourse is mostly disregarded, and we appear to  ‘witness’ the storyworld as if it were located in a realm beyond the text and even,  albeit paradoxically, independently of it,8 hence with a feeling of “immediacy.” The third specification of narrative illusion refers to the narrativity of the  texts under consideration and highlights the importance of a dynamic experience  of time and change. The dynamic quality of fiction-induced aesthetic illusion also  implies a specification of its center. Aesthetic illusion is typically centered on the  following two constituents of histoire: action and characters (that is: characters  in action, whether in “outer” or “inner,” psychological action). In contrast to this,  “descriptive,” static elements such as settings or characters’ looks—although these  also play a role in the creation, and in particular intensification, of narrative illu- sion—are only of secondary importance. 3. Factors Contributing to Aesthetic Illusion As mentioned before, aesthetic illusion—including its narrative variant—is a  phenomenon, or, as Herbert Grabes (cf. 408, 428) has rightly emphasized, a process  that is produced by several factors. These can be described as elements contribut- </page> <page sequence="9"> Aesthetic Illusion as an Effect of Fiction 333 ing to a “guided projection” (Gombrich 169). The projection takes place in the  mind of the recipient, yet in the state of aesthetic illusion this mind’s activity is not  free-floating but “guided” by the illusionist artefact, and both the recipient and the  artefact are influenced in turn by contexts which also contribute to the projection.  The following factors therefore need to be taken into account (all of which are also  present in Cortázar’s story):   a. the recipient (the “projector” of illusion);   b. the artefact (the guiding “script”), and, in some cases—which, however,  do not include the typical reception of fiction—its performance (the mise  en scène of the “script”);    c. cultural and historical contexts and reception conditions (the “room” in  which the script is originally located and where the guided projection  takes place). As for the cultural and historical contexts, we must always assume a plurality  of those (unless a text, its author, and its reader are contemporary and part of the  same culture). This has noteworthy consequences: The effect of aesthetic illusion  may be conceived of, as already mentioned, as produced by a relative correspon- dence or analogy between, on the one hand, the artefact, its content and structure,  and, on the other hand, essential concepts and experiential contents, contextual  elements that influence both the author and the recipient and regulate the operations  of verisimilitude as a prime condition of aesthetic illusionism. Since there is no  “natural,” universally valid perception and experience of reality, let alone worldview,  differences between the contexts of production and reception can substantially affect  the emergence of aesthetic illusion. Hence verisimilitude—and with it aesthetic  illusionism—are to a considerable extent historically and culturally variable. As a  result, the same work or similar techniques of representation can change in their  illusionist valeur according to temporal and spatial parameters. Another, equally  variable contextual factor that influences aesthetic illusion can be located in the set  of frames that rule the production and reception of the arts and media in a given  period. For instance, the question is crucial to what extent aesthetic illusionism  and an aesthetic approach to artworks including aesthetic distance are practiced  or known in a given culture or period (for “Continuity of Parks” this is clearly the  case) or whether a “magical” approach is predominant and certain artefacts are  regarded as numinous realities. Such frames also include generic conventions. The  miniature novel read in Cortázar’s story, for instance, is clearly a criminal love- story, and the existence of this schema permits Cortázar to outline the narrative in  no more than a few words. The dependence of aesthetic illusionism on contextual  factors can be illustrated by texts in which supernatural agencies appear. These will  have different effects, according to the acceptability of such appearances within  the cultural framework relevant to the reader (or which he is willing to grant the  text) and according to generic frames (e.g., the applicability of the conventions of  Gothic fiction to a given text). </page> <page sequence="10"> 334 Werner Wolf Even more variable than the factor “context” is the factor “recipient.” A recipi- ent’s illusionist response is not only subject to external, contextual circumstances  but is also heavily dependent on individual factors such as his or her range of experi- ence, age, gender, interests, cultural background, and ability to “read” works of art  aesthetically. The illusionist response further depends on the reception conditions,  e. g., whether a novel is read for the first time or not, and, last but not least, on the  recipient’s willingness—clearly given in Cortázar’s reader—to become immersed  in an illusionist reception. Due to these variables it is difficult, if not impossible, to decide on the actual  illusionist effect of a given work, text, artistic technique, etc. for all periods and for  all individuals. However, this does not mean that nothing at all can be said about the  factor “artefact” or text—on condition that one accept a  ceteris paribus approach.  Such a procedure is acceptable in particular if one limits the contextual scope to  the past few centuries and to the analysis of works from Western culture (where  the evolution of aesthetic verisimilitude and the responses to illusionist artefacts  are fairly well documented). Moreover, one needs to reduce the variability of in- dividual recipients by means of the theoretical construct of an “average recipient”  who is able and prepared to “willingly suspend [his/her] disbelief” in the reception  process, but is distanced enough not to become the victim of an experiential or  referential delusion. If context, reception conditions, and the recipient are problematic variables,  this does not seem to the same degree to be the case for the artefact, performance  or “work”—provided, of course, that one does not subscribe to the Barthesian  rejection of the notion of the “work” as a readymade construct and agrees that,  where aesthetic illusion occurs, it is to a considerable extent the “work” that guides  the illusionist projection. This at least is a practical assumption (which is also cor- roborated by Cortázar’s story) and enables narratology to contribute to a theory  of aesthetic illusion in the first place: the particular accessibility of the “work”  permits the description of typical features and devices of illusionist texts but also  of the formal principles that inform them, their structure and make-up, and this  procedure also allows the critic to highlight some techniques and devices that are  frequently used in illusionist texts. Such descriptions, which form the backbone of a “text-centered” theory of  literary illusion (as part of a larger theory that still needs to be developed), can be  derived from a huge corpus of primary works which encompass several centuries  of Western history, works that have been, and to some extent still are, read as more  or less illusionist—in contrast to others (such as radically experimental postmod- ernist fictions) which thwart an illusionist access. It is with this illusionist corpus  and its features in mind that one can indeed say something about the illusionist  potential of a given literary text or genre, for no more can be claimed, on account  of the aforementioned variables. In fact, if in the following the terms “features,”  “principles of illusion-making,” and “illusionist devices” are used, it is with the  </page> <page sequence="11"> Aesthetic Illusion as an Effect of Fiction 335 proviso that they are not meant to be textual essences with fixed effects in the  framework of a prescriptive theory. Rather, such entities should be regarded—to  borrow from Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan’s “post-classical” rethinking of structuralist  narratology—as elements of “implied reading potentials informing the interaction  between reader and text, between interpretive communities and text, between a  culture’s encoded ideology and a reader’s compliant or resistant decoding” (145).  With this proviso, the corpus of illusionist fiction moreover permits one to select a  prototype with a particularly high degree of illusionist “reading potential.”  4. Typical Features of Illusionist Fiction and the Principles of  Illusion-Making in Fiction In the history of fiction, the illusionist prototype of the past few centuries ap- pears to be the nineteenth-century realist novel, which has always been accorded a  particularly high potential for eliciting illusionist immersion. Realist novels in fact  manage to draw readers quite easily into their worlds, and they keep the readers  “recentered” there because they successfully maintain a feeling of verisimilitude  and experientiality while minimizing aesthetic distance. On the basis of realist texts  it is therefore possible to isolate illusion-inducing textual features which can then  be linked to principles of fictional illusion-making and specific narrative devices. In narratological terms, typically illusionist novels of realism, such as George  Eliot’s Adam Bede or Hardy’s Tess of the d’Urbervilles, display the following  features:   1. their story level is the central text level, their storyworlds have a certain  extension and complexity, are consistent and lifelike in their inventory  and generally correspond to the reader’s expectations of a narrative;   2. their level of discourse is comparatively inconspicuous, serving mainly to  transmit the storyworlds and to support their consistency and lifelikeness;   3. story and discourse show a remarkable tendency towards seriousness;    4. the texts are predominantly heteroreferential. As not all of these traits are self-explanatory, some comments are in order.  The centrality of the story level, which can also be observed in Cortázar’s text,  correlates with what has been said about the principal object of illusionist immer- sion. The story world is, after all, the realm on which the immersive potential and  the experientiality of illusionist texts tend to be focused. Illusionist worlds typically have a certain extension, because aesthetic illu- sion emerges during a process, the process of transition from normal perception  to aesthetic, illusionist reception. If this process is too short, because the text is  too brief, immersion will not so easily take place. (“Continuity of Parks,” which  extends over only one page and half, is here for once atypical!) The same argument also accounts for the relative complexity of most illusionist  worlds (again a feature that Cortázar’s story, owing to its shortness, does not pos- sess). Although, at first glance, this may be regarded as a special feature of realist  </page> <page sequence="12"> 336 Werner Wolf fiction only, further analysis reveals that complexity is a feature that ties in with  the general quality of aesthetic illusionism, namely that of recentering the recipi- ent in a possible world, whose quality as “world” is enhanced by both extension  and complexity. The consistency and lifelikeness of realistic narrative worlds are actually facets  of a more general quality of illusionist possible worlds, namely their accessibil- ity. Possible worlds can be more or less accessible and provide different types of  accessibility (cf. Ryan, Narrative 32-33). It is clear that an enhanced accessibility  facilitates illusionist immersion, and this is why illusionist works tend to lower  the threshold of access as much as possible and even “lure” their readers into their  worlds. In realism, this tendency shows in the presentation of fictional worlds that  generally seem to be an extension of the recipients’ real world in terms of spatial,  temporal (contemporary), and social settings but also, e.g., in terms of norms, ideals,  and epistemological preconceptions about the “readability” of reality. In “Continu- ity of Parks” this “continuity” between the situation in which the reading process  takes place and (part of) the hypodiegetic story is even emphasized in the title. The basic conformity of illusionist possible worlds to the frame “narrative”  means that these worlds possess not only a spatial but also—and predominantly—a  temporal dimension, as they are organized around a dynamic story which forms  their backbone (as again epitomized by Cortázar’s text). The relative inconspicuousness of the level of discourse can be illustrated  in “Continuity of Parks,” with reference to the embedded story, by the fact that  it is recounted as a straightforward narrative (the summary-like style of the first  part of the text underlines this impression). The unobtrusiveness of the discourse  forms a counterpart to the centrality of the storyworld and is related to the nature  of illusionist immersion, which is to predominate over aesthetic distance. It is  therefore understandable that typically illusionist works—while not suppressing  them entirely—tend to keep distancing elements to a minimum. The scarcity of distancing elements in typically illusionist works can be seen  in their tendency to avoid highlighting the mediacy or fictionality of the artefact  (Cortázar’s story deviates from this feature, owing to its metafictionaliy). The  shunning of distance can moreover be witnessed in a no less typical illusionist  trend, namely the avoidance of comedy (a feature which is again illustrated by the  seriousness of Cortázar’s story, which appears to culminate in a murder). Both facets  can be observed with particular clarity in realist novels: while they do not totally  eschew strategies such as metafictional self-referentiality, they always maintain a  predominant heteroreferentiality; and in spite of a certain humor, for example in  Dickens’s storytelling, comedy in realism never reaches the point of carnivalesque  hilariousness and subversiveness, as it does in Tristram Shandy for example. Car- nivalesque laughter, as described by Mikhail Bakhtin, is in fact to a large extent  antagonistic to illusionist immersion for two reasons. Owing to their tendency to  establish a subversive community without hierarchical differences (“familiariza- </page> <page sequence="13"> Aesthetic Illusion as an Effect of Fiction 337 tion”), carnivalesque topsy-turvy worlds frequently disregard thresholds, includ- ing, in comic texts, the threshold between the real and the fictional world (e.g., in  metalepses or the parabasis of comedy). Such “impossible” blurrings highlight the  fictionality of the comic world and thus create distance from it. Secondly, distance  from comic objects is also implied in the very nature of loud laughter, which re- quires an anesthésie momentanée du coeur (Bergson 4). Aesthetic illusion, on the  contrary, has an affinity with emotional involvement, and this in turn correlates  with seriousness, as can also be seen in drama. Tragedies tend towards aesthetic  illusionism (Aristotle’s “catharsis” in fact presupposes it to a large extent), while  comedies frequently have a propensity towards the breaking of illusion. The predominant heteroreferentiality of realist fiction is actually a consequence  of the more general fact that all illusionist artefacts, even those that ultimately play  with illusion, like Cortázar’s story, are representational9: they evoke or “represent”  a world that is seemingly outside the artefact, which therefore appears to refer to  something other than itself (and thus is “heteroreferential”). As a special, historical  kind of mimesis, the realistic novel is in fact strongly heteroreferential. Yet this does  not mean that mimesis alone guarantees aesthetic illusion. Other features, as will  be noted in the following, also contribute to the triggering of aesthetic illusion. Nor  is it the case that all illusionist texts must be either realistic (they can also be, e.g.,  modernist) or mimetic in the sense of imitating (slices of) reality. (As opposed to  such “imitation,” fantasy fiction can be illusionist, too.) The relationship between  aesthetic illusion, mimesis, and realism is schematically represented in figure 2. The basic features of illusionist fiction can further be linked to some general  principles of illusion-making that give rise to them. It should be noted, though,  that the nature of aesthetic illusion as a gradable effect, which is frequently the  result of a subtle balance between sometimes conflicting textual factors, tolerates  certain deviations from prototypically illusionist model-texts, and that therefore  in individual cases not all of these principles will be traceable to the same degree.  In addition, owing to the other, extratextual factors involved in the emergence of  aesthetic illusionism, these principles should only be regarded as tendencies that  enhance the potential for aesthetic illusion but cannot guarantee its realization.  Nevertheless, the principles to be enumerated below can be illuminating not only  for the description of individual illusionist texts but also historically, for they ap- pear to motivate certain developments in the history of fiction. Up to the beginning  of the twentieth century (including some facets of modernism), this history can  be described in a formula coined by Gombrich for the visual arts: it is a “progress  from rude beginnings to the perfection of illusion” (4). The general direction of  this “progress,” namely the development of ever more persuasive narrative devices,  is perhaps explicable without recourse to these principles, for it was probably mo- tivated by the necessity of supplementing old techniques that may have lost their  original force.10 Yet the details of this development, e.g., concerning the evolution  of narrative perspective, may be accounted for by an ever closer observation of the  </page> <page sequence="14"> 338 Werner Wolf aesthetic illusion realism mimesis Fig. 2: Aesthetic illusion, mimesis, and realism principles introduced below, whose persuasiveness arguably derives from their rela- tion to real-life perception. (This would, however, also mean that for the recipients  of different epochs different degrees in the realization of these principles may have  produced similar illusionist effects.) In what follows I propose six general principles of illusion-making in literary  fiction. The first four of these shape the material of an illusionist possible world,  its coherence and presentation in general; the other two inform the particular,  persuasive “rhetoricity” of illusionist texts. Principle One: The access- and immersion-facilitating construction of the  possible world’s inventory The representationality of illusionist fiction is due to the application of a prin- ciple whose most basic purpose is to offer the recipients some concrete “building  blocks” as material for the possible world in which they can recenter themselves  in their imagination (a mere argument consisting of abstract notions would not  suffice). In Seymour Chatman’s terminology these “building blocks” are “story- existents” (107) and “events” (43), that is, setting and anthropomorphic actants  (i.e., characters), and their experiences. Yet this is not sufficient, as such story material only fulfills elementary condi- tions of narratives, regardless of their illusionist potential. In fact the principle under  discussion does more than merely regulate the existence of some possible-world  elements: it monitors a construction of the inventory of the possible world that  allows an easy accessibility to it and creates a life like impression of “fullness.” One of the effects of this principle is, for instance, the furnishing of possible  worlds with objects (locales, institutions, public persons, contemporary events,  etc.) that are well-known to the reader. (This feature is instantiated to an extreme,  </page> <page sequence="15"> Aesthetic Illusion as an Effect of Fiction 339 perhaps ironic extent by “Continuity of Parks,” as the house into which the hy- podiegetic murderer creeps curiously resembles the very building in which the  diegetic reader lives.) Another of its effects relates to the amount of detail with which the illusionist  universe is equipped. Strongly illusionist narratives typically do not merely sketch  a possible world but, in analogy to the wealth of details perceived in everyday life,  show a tendency towards imitating this wealth, thereby reducing the indeterminacies  that to some extent occur in all representation. This “fleshing out” of the “bones”  of the story is realized by providing “graphic,” usually visual details of objects,  settings, characters, experiences, or events. Such descriptions facilitate readerly  immersion and frequently create memorable “scenes. 11”  Since the eighteenth century  the tendency towards descriptive visualization in illusionist fiction, which is dis- cernible both in the frame and the framed story of Cortázar’s extremely condensed  “Continuity of Parks,” was supported (and even propelled) by an increasingly visual  culture that relied more and more on the empirical, outer appearance of things and  produced a growing mass of pictures. The illusionist principle under discussion thus provides the inventories for  fictional worlds; it does so in an illusion-friendly way that facilitates access to  them. It is due to this principle’s “access- and immersion-facilitating construction  of the possible worlds’ inventories” that the center of illusionist fictions is “visibly”  the level of the “story” rather than the level of the “discourse” and that illusionist  stories are characterized by a predominance of fictional (hetero)referentiality over  self-referentiality. This referentiality can point to possible worlds of outer “reality”  (as in realist fiction and in drama) or of inner, psychological “reality” (as in the  more “subjective” illusion created by modernist interior monologue or stream-of- consciousness fiction). Principle Two: The consistency of the possible world Illusionist narratives enhance the probability of their worlds by linking their  inventories in a particular way. Although possible worlds could theoretically be  constructed on the basis of all sorts of rules, illusionist worlds tend to be informed,  at least in fundamental, logical and epistemological respects, by rules that are com- patible, or identical, with the rules governing real life. Thus the overall tendency is  to ensure a fundamental analogy between the experience of the illusionist world and  the perception of the real world. This means that illusionist worlds are internally  coherent and meet basic expectations of meaningfulness that also apply to real- life experience, e.g., concerning the absence of unresolvable contradictions, the  consistency of time and place, causality, teleology, the difference between reality  and fiction, etc. This internal coherence and external compatibility is regulated  by the “principle of consistency.” With the noteworthy exception of the suggested  metaleptic ending, this principle also applies to “Continuity of Parks.”  One must, however, acknowledge that the principle of consistency is not so  </page> <page sequence="16"> 340 Werner Wolf strict as not to tolerate certain deviations of the rules governing illusionist worlds  from those of the actual one. Consistency operates according to Ryan’s “principle  of minimal departure” (Narrrative 51): it is a default option. Departures are pos- sible, and can even remain compatible with illusion, provided they are marked and  explained or linked, e.g., to generic conventions and thus obtain a secondary kind  of plausibility. Neither does the internal coherence of illusionist worlds rule out  all obscurities—as long as these can be clarified by links between the “deficient”  areas and neighboring more coherent ones (e.g., the seemingly inconsistent behav- ior of a character may be explicable with reference to a certain situation clarified  afterwards). Historically, the principle of consistency can be seen in operation in  the fact that most illusionist works tend to avoid deficiencies in coherence and are  characterized, in terms of narratology, by the “transparency” of their discourse,  since it is this transparency which permits the recipient’s attention to focus, in a  relatively “easy reception,” on the story rather than on the discourse. Of course,  “transparency” does not imply an “absence” of discourse (an impossibility anyway).  The discourse in illusionist works can even be quite elaborate (e.g., in the handling  of discourse-time), as long as it does not foreground this elaborateness, as will be  seen in the following. An important factor in the creation of consistency is the figure  of the narrator, in particular the authorial, “omniscient” narrator. Principle Three: Perspectivity The experientiality and probability of illusionist texts are the result also of  other principles. One of these is the principle of perspectivity. In fact, one of the  most characteristic hallmarks of the history of illusionism (both in painting and  literature) has been the development and perfection of techniques that imitate the  perspectivity of everday experience, that is, the inevitable limitation of perception  according to the point of view and horizon of the perceiver 12.  In Western fiction  this development results in the increasing use of internal focalization since the  eighteenth-century first-person epistolary novels and later in modernist third-person  “figural narration,” where the “subjectivity” of the internal focalizer gradually su- persedes the “objectivity” of an overt narrator and enhances the illusionist effect of  “immediacy.” Immediacy is an efficient trigger of aesthetic illusion. In “Continuity  of Parks,” this effect is admirably exploited by the dominant internal perspective,  which allows both the fictitious reader and ourselves to follow the hypodiegetic  murderer on his way to his victim. On the other hand—and this is an example of  the fact that aesthetic illusion is indeed the result of a balance between textual fac- tors—the near-elimination of an overt narrator can also generate problems with  textual coherence; the principle of perspectivity can thus come into conflict with  the principle of consistency. Principle Four: Respecting and exploiting the potential of the medium and the  genre employed The fact that illusionist narratives (as opposed to, e.g., lyric poetry) typically  </page> <page sequence="17"> Aesthetic Illusion as an Effect of Fiction 341 display a certain extension and possess a relatively inconspicuous discourse, and  that they moreover do not principally consist of descriptions, is the result of a  fourth principle: that of respecting and exploiting the potential of the medium and  the chosen genre. The generic facet of this principle can be explained by the cir- cumstance that surprising departures from generic conventions would foreground  these conventions as such and would therefore shift the reader’s attention from the  possible world as the center of aesthetic illusion to the conditions of its construc- tion. As regards the respecting of the medium, the workings of this principle can  be described as follows. Since literature, in contrast to the visual arts, primarily  unfolds in time, it is conducive to the creation and perpetuation of aesthetic illu- sion to respect this “natural” condition of the medium by taking the time-aspect of  reception into account. This implies that literary texts have to allow for a gradual  building up of illusionist worlds (a fact that is acknowledged by Cortázar’s having  his hero “disengag[e] himself line by line from the things around him”) and for the  maintenance of illusion over a more or less extended period of time and length of  text. The operation of this medium-related principle can also be observed where  both fiction and drama as dynamic, temporal media pay special attention to the  dynamic “story” elements of action and character. A contrary procedure, namely  writing fiction that “goes against the grain of the medium,” e.g., by overemphasiz- ing static, descriptive elements (as does the French nouveau roman), exposes its  limits, makes the recipient aware of the artificiality of the work and therefore fails  to be in agreement with another typical feature of illusionist works: the reduction  of aesthetic distance. Moreover, this signals a departure from another illusionist  principle (see Principle Six). Principle Five: Generating (an emotional) interest in the possible world Illusionist texts and artefacts do not merely offer experiential immersion in  a passive way; they actively appeal to the readers and thereby also contribute to  minimalizing aesthetic distance. Such appeal is regulated by what I call the “prin- ciple of generating interest in the story.” This is a “positive” rhetorical principle  which is reponsible for various devices of persuasio that serve to render the story  attractive and keep the reader “in” it. In their concern with a focus of interest, il- lusionist works imitate a further aspect of real-life perception, which is usually  motivated by certain interests. While the fact that illusionist works induce the  reader’s “immersion” in their worlds appears to be a common feature, the how,  i.e., the means by which the reader’s interest is captivated, are highly variable and  may range from story-elements of “sex and crime” (as in the embedded story in  “Continuity of Parks”) to discursive devices of maintaining suspense (e.g. Dickens’s  “cliff-hanging chapter endings”) and thematic elements (e.g., of topical relevance  to contemporary culture). In accordance with the general importance of emotions  for illusionist immersion, a particular field of activity of this principle are devices  and story contents (such as love interests, tragic deaths etc.) which appeal to the  </page> <page sequence="18"> 342 Werner Wolf reader emotionally. This principle may also be considered to be responsible for the  scarcity, in typically illusionist texts, of elements such as carnivalesque comedy,  since these reduce affective involvement. However, it should be noted once again that generally, the realization of all  illusionist principles is to a certain degree relative and rests on extratextual fac- tors. In the case of the principle under discussion this relativity is particularly  prominent. “Interest” obviously does not only depend on the text itself but also, if  not primarily, on the dispositions of individual readers and on contextual factors.  This relativity has led critics to become particularly wary about this principle (cf.  Nünning, Review 141, 145). Yet, like the category of “tellability” in the theory of  narrativity (cf. Pratt 132-51), this principle (which can in fact be conceived of as  an intensified variant of “tellability”) must be maintained at least as a formal cat- egory with variable contents in order to account for the fact that arousing interest  in the recipients (in particular in an emotional way) is frequently coupled with a  successful creation of aesthetic illusion. Principle Six: Celare artem The tendency of illusionist fiction to minimize aesthetic distance as well as  the conspicuousness of its discourse are regulated by a last principle which, in  accordance with the rhetoric and aesthetics of antiquity, the Renaissance, and the  eighteenth century, may be called the “principle of celare artem” (or of the conceal- ment of artificiality). This formula is used e.g. by Dryden in “An Essay of Dramatick  Poesie” (66). Similarly to the principle of respecting the medium, the principle of  “celare artem” contributes to creating a fictional analogy to the condition of real-life  perception, focusing the fact that we usually disregard the limiting conditions and  the mediacy of our perceptions. Works following this principle tend to conceal their  mediacy and artificiality by a relative avoidance of over-intrusive self-referentiality  and generally of all devices that foreground textuality or fictionality. The principle  of celare artem, in particular, regulates the use of all kinds of metatextuality and, in  the interest of illusionist immersion, can be said to be responsible for the suppres- sion of open manifestations of fictionality as well as—together with the principle  of coherence—for the avoidance of paradoxical devices such as metalepses. (Here  “Continuity of Parks” deviates most conspicuously from typical illusionist texts.) 5. Functions of Aesthetic Illusion Having presented the principles of illusion-making, I now turn to the func- tions of aesthetic illusionism. Aesthetic illusion is alluring—for some (including  the implied author of “Continuity of Parks”) even to a dangerous extent. This at- tractiveness depends on a panoply of reception- and production-centered functions,  only some of which can be mentioned here. Among the reception-centered functions of aesthetic illusionism, pleasurable  entertainment looms large. (Pleasurable relaxation is also the principal motivation  for Cortázar’s diegetic reader, who “taste[s] an almost perverse pleasure” in becom- </page> <page sequence="19"> Aesthetic Illusion as an Effect of Fiction 343 ing “absorbed” in his novel.) Part of this entertainment derives from the simple  exertion of the imagination as an aspect of the human capacity for transcending  empirical reality. (This also includes toying with “impossible” worlds, such as  the one emerging from the suggestion of a metaleptic conclusion in “Continuity  of Parks.”) The pleasure of aesthetic illusion is also inextricably linked with a  second—and often criticized—function: the escape from real-life deficiencies.  (These deficiencies may be of a general emotional, sensory, or experiential kind,  e.g., satisfying the reader’s wishes for adventures.) In addition, aesthetic illusion  also allows the reader to take on, and explore, in a playful way and without the  consequences this could have in real life, personalities and patterns of behavior  that would be impossible or unsuitable in reality. As for production-centered functions, catering to the wishes of readers may  enhance an author’s popularity and make reading his or her texts appear more at- tractive in a competitive market of illusionist artefacts. Where experiential illusion  is moreover coupled with referential illusion, the resulting impression of “imitat- ing reality” can also contribute to the ennobling of fiction under the auspices of a  mimetic aesthetics. (This capacity of convincingly imitating reality was frequently  used as an argument in favor of the novel in the period of its emancipation in the  eighteenth century). At the same time, fictional illusionism can be a means of  persuasion employed to render artefacts suitable vehicles for extraliterary pur- poses. I am here thinking of moral or social didacticism and criticism, but also of  authors’ attempts to reassure or persuade readers with regard to the truth of certain  worldviews. This persuasive function of aesthetic illusionism notably refers to the  general tendendy of artefacts, and in particular of narratives, to present unified,  closed, and meaningful worlds whose meaningfulness (most conspicuously in the  convention of “poetic justice”) could be regarded as “unrealistic” and contrary to  the contingency of life. To present such an “unrealistic” surplus of coherence and  significance in conjunction with strong inducements for aesthetic illusion may  make the reader accept this excess of coherence more easily, disregarding its con- structedness. One could even argue, from a historical point of view, that aesthetic  illusionism in the sense of philosophical persuasion becomes all the more relevant  when the belief in the self-evidence of a meaningful universe declines. Where the  credibility of literary constructions such as poetic justice is no longer supported by  external, philosophical or religious beliefs, possible worlds that (still) propagate  such views must create their own, internal credibility—and this can efficiently be  achieved by aesthetic illusion as a means of suspending not only aesthetic but also  philosophical disbelief. Of course, this works only up to a point. Where a certain  degree of disbelief is exceeded, as in the postmodern era, this often leads to a depar- ture from illusionism altogether; the artefacts then tend to undermine the aesthetic  illusion invoked by the text or performance. An analogy emerges here between the  undermining of “philosophical illusions” and the breaking of aesthetic illusion.  </page> <page sequence="20"> 344 Werner Wolf 6. The Breaking of Aesthetic Illusion The breaking of illusion is a field too vast to be treated in detail in this context,  so a few remarks will have to suffice. Generally, anti-illusionism in fiction and  elsewhere is a derivative phenomenon and always presupposes the existence of  aesthetic illusion, be it in the same work or as a convention in the cultural context.  Historically, anti-illusionism is almost as old as illusionism. In addition to the  cultural context, the individual recipient and the work (and its performance) are  as much factors in the breaking of illusion as in its formation. In its essence the  breaking of illusion can be defined as the realization and “inflation” of the potential  of distance that already exists latently within the aesthetic illusion itself at the pole  opposite to immersion. Works that consistently break aesthetic illusion (again ceteris paribus) dis- play features that, as is to be expected, are opposed to those of illusionist works.  Rather than drawing recipients into their possible worlds and keeping them there,  they deploy distancing devices so that the recipients remain “outside.” Instead of  giving centrality to the level of the story, they tend to devaluate it, and instead of  rendering the level of discourse inconspicuous, they foreground it. Rather than  displaying a tendency towards seriousness, they are frequently comic, and in the  place of a dominant heteroreferentiality they tend to emphasize self-referentiality  and self-reflexivity. This latter feature also characterizes “Continuity of Parks” as  a metatextual allegory of the potentials of aesthetic illusionism and of its dangers.  These dangers appear most clearly if one solves the paradoxical ending by regard- ing it as a depiction of the psychological state of the diegetic reader, whose all too  illusionist reception eventually makes him even feel threatened by a character of  the book he is reading. The real readers, after having been led astray by the text  and the experience of illusion themselves, are meant to go one step further and to  distance themselves from such a degeneration of this illusion into delusion. In this  they are helped by the text’s metafictional theme, some self-reflexive reminders of  fictionality, such as the phrase, “A lustful, panting dialogue raced down the pages,”  and, above all, by the final adumbration of metalepsis. Moreover, the features of anti-illusionistic or illusion-breaking works can  also be linked with the principles of illusion outlined above, the difference being  that illusionist works tend to follow these principles, while anti-illusionist texts do  not. “Continuity of Parks,” for instance, not only violates the principle of celare  artem by its overt self-reflexivity, but also, by suggesting a logically “impossible”  metalepsis, flouts the principle of coherence and hence the credibility of the story.  These relationships are visualized in figure 3, which at the same time provides an  overview of the theoretical notions used in this essay. As regards particular textual devices that can cause the breaking of illusion, I  cannot here provide as much detail as in my earlier remarks on aesthetic illusion,  where at least some devices were mentioned in the context of the principles of  illusion-making. Only a schematic overview of some potentially illusion-breaking  </page> <page sequence="21"> Aesthetic Illusion as an Effect of Fiction 345 techniques can be given here (see figure 4). The techniques are arranged according  to the four general features detectable in illusion-breaking works to which they  principally contribute, although this does not mean that they cannot also influence  other features as well. 7. Conclusion: Desiderata for Further Research The foregoing discussion operates within a “philological,” primarily text- centered framework, and a text-centered theory of illusion is indeed an indispens- able contribution to what may eventually become a larger theory applicable also to  other media and artefacts. However, such a theory would require further research  in areas that could not be treated in the present framework. One of these areas is the systematic search for more historical evidence of  aesthetic illusion and its properties, while another is the gathering of empirical  responses of contemporary readers to certain texts and devices. The latter could  shed a welcome light on the details of the interaction between text features or  textual principles and their effects. A discipline in which research on aesthetic  illusion could be continued with particular profit is cognitive science. Testing the  “analogy thesis,” on which part of my theory is based, would be of special interest.  This applies, above all, to the relations between textual illusionist principles and  real-life perception, notably, the seeming objectivity of perception in spite of its  actual mediacy and its dependence on concepts, frames, interests, and perspectives  of the perceivers. Last but not least, a desideratum for future research is certainly  interdisciplinary cooperation, not only between narratology and cognitive science  but also—and more modestly—between narratology and drama theory, art history,  and film studies.13 Notes 1  Herbert Grabes’s enlightening essay on the aesthetic illusion produced by  fictional characters also counts among these pioneering studies [translated in is- sue 38.2 (eds.)]. 2  “Experientiality” has also been used in narratology to redefine “narrativity”  (Fludernik, esp. ch. 1.2.1). Yet this blurs central generic distinctions in literature,  since “experientiality,” especially if defined as “emotional involvement, evaluative  or empathetic” (Fludernik 318), can occur in fiction, drama, and lyric poetry alike.  I therefore propose to use “experientiality” not as a defining category of narrativity,  but rather as a textual effect that is essential to illusionist reception. 3  In her distinction of four degrees of “immersion” or “absorption” Ryan  qualifies this as “Addiction” and aptly calls it the “Don Quixote syndrome” (Nar- rative 99), which she differentiates from the preceding degree (“Entrancement”),  in which the “reader remains aware in the back of his mind that [. . .] the textual  world is not reality” (98-99).  4  French criticism is therefore misleading where it uses the term “illusion  </page> <page sequence="22"> 346 Werner Wolf illusionist works anti-illusionist works Textual factors a) Principles access- and immersion-facilitating  construction of the possible world’s  inventory consistency nonfulfillment of illusionist perspectivity  respecting and exploiting      principles the potential of the medium generating interest in  the possible world celare artem b) Characteristic centrality of the level of story devaluation of the level of story features      inconspicuousness of the level of foregrounding of the level of  discourse. discourse tendency towards serious contents tendency towards comic content and  and serious representation  comic representation   heteroreferentiality self-referentiality/self-reflexivity  Other factors recipient-centered and contextual (cultural and historical) factors  Effects Formation of aesthetic Breaking of aesthetic illusion Fig. 3: Principal elements of a theory of aesthetic illusion </page> <page sequence="23"> Aesthetic Illusion as an Effect of Fiction 347 CHARACTERISTIC POTENTIALLY ILLUSION-BREAKING TEXTUAL  FEATURESOF ILLUSION- DEVICES BREAKINGWORKS  (compare fig. 3 under b) Devaluation of  the level of story •  improbable overdetermination of meaning and order (e.g.  speaking names; obtrusive repetition of story elements  through mises en abyme) and the obvious determination of  the story by “alien”, artificial factors (e.g. by intertextual  ‘pre-texts’) •  extreme reduction of the story’s eventfulness (“too little  plot”) •  hypertrophical and/or incoherent fabulation (“too much  plot/too many plots”) •  construction of impossible/improbable worlds (e.g.  through metalepses) Foregrounding of the level of •  salient use of the verbal and textual narrative medium  discourse (e.g. agrammatical language; foregrounding of textual  materiality in “typographical devices”) •  overdetermination of discursive meaning (e.g. obtrusive  use of symbols) •  underdetermination of discursive meaning (resulting, e.g.,  in “gaps of meaning,” indeterminacies, ambiguities, lack  of causality and teleology, etc.)  •  improbable or salient use of narrative situation (e.g. in  second-person narration or by over-intrusive narrators),  perspective, tense, and mood  •  the domination of narration by non-narrative discourse  types (e.g. description in the nouveau roman)   •  deviations from probable storyworlds in the obvious  Tendency towards comic contents service of comic effects (e.g. in carnivalesque topsy-turvy  and comic representation worlds) •  overtly satiric or parodistic devices of storytelling •  all forms of explicit metatextuality (metafiction,  Self-referentiality/self-reflexivity metanarration, metalinguistic elements, etc.) •  for implicit metatextuality see above, the devices under  “devaluation of the story level” and “foregrounding of  the discourse level,” most of which can function as covert  forms of metatextuality Fig. 4: Potentially illusion-breaking devices in fiction  </page> <page sequence="24"> 348 Werner Wolf référentielle” (e.g. Ricardou 31) instead of “illusion esthétique”; this must be said  regardless of the fact that fictions of authenticity, and hence the referential variant  of aesthetic illusion, can reinforce the principal, experiential variant.  5  Strictly speaking, “narrative aesthetic illusion induced by fiction” would be  the correct term, yet, for brevity’s sake, I will condense this to “narrative illusion.” 6  Today, such referential illusion only plays a role in special cases, e.g. in  “musicalized” or “filmized” fiction, where a reference to another medium is created  by imitating features or effects of that medium. 7  For this thesis and relevant research cf. Wolf, Ästhetische 69-70; cf. also  Bourdieu 334: “To understand this belief effect itself [aesthetic illusion . . .] one  must observe [...] that it rests on the accord between the presuppositions (or,  more precisely, the schemas of construction) that the narrator and the reader [. .  .] engage in the production and the reception of the work” [Pour comprendre cet  effet de croyance lui-même [...] il faut [...] observer qu’il repose sur l’accord  entre les présupposés ou, plus précisément, les schèmes de construction que le  narrateur et le lecteur [...] engagent dans la production et la réception de l’œvre  [...] (Règles 456)]. 8  Cf. Ryan, Narrative 91: “the text is apprehended as a window on something  that exists outside language and extends in time and space well beyond the window  frame.” It must be stressed that for the purpose of describing aesthetic illusion only  the impression of a world beyond the text is at issue, and this impression arises  independently of philosophical considerations.  9  Nonrepresentational art such as abstract painting and instrumental music  therefore cannot elicit aesthetic illusion. 10  The suspicion that a progressive “inflation” of persuasive devices is neces- sary to maintain a certain level of aesthetic illusion in the course of time—and that  therefore no absolute technical standards can be given—can be corroborated by  comparing the degree of illusionist sophistication that suffices for small children  as opposed to the degree required by adults. Another example would be the history  of film. In the beginning, short, soundless black-and-white films in which studio  settings showed often to an extent that would today be unacceptable seem to have  had similar illusionist effects as later black-and-white sound films, and these in  turn at first seemed no less persuasive than later films produced in technicolor and  using natural locations.  11  This dovetails with the claim made by cognitive psychologists that stories  tend to be imagined as sequences of pictures (see Vellusig 365). 12  Although narrative perspective is primarily cognitive, from the later eigh- teenth century onwards perspective as a pro-illusionist device in fiction has also  often included the imitation of visual perspective. 13  For a preliminary attempt to extend narratological research to other media  see Wolf, “Intermediale .” </page> <page sequence="25"> Aesthetic Illusion as an Effect of Fiction 349 Works Cited Bakhtin, Mikhail.
