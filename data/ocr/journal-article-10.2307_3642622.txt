<plain_text><page sequence="1">HORNED OBJECTS IN ANATOLIA AND THE NEAR EAST AND POSSIBLE CONNEXIONS WITH THE MINOAN " HORNS OF CONSECRATION " By STEVEN DIAMANT and JEREMY RUTTER NUMEROUS INTERPRETATIONS OF the meaning, function, and derivation of the Minoan " horns of consecration " have been put forward since Evans discovered the first object of this kind in his excavations at Knossos.I As yet, not one of the various theories proposed has been universally accepted. Consequently, the authors of this article would prefer not to be so presumptuous as to claim that they have indeed solved the problem of the usage and origins of the Minoan " horns "; on the other hand they believe that excavations in the past twenty years have strongly suggested that the Minoan " horns " have their origins in Anatolia and that the object's function, originally at least, was a pot-support in a hearth.2 In Anatolia, horned objects which we consider served as precursors of the Minoan " horns of consecration" fall into three classes. Examples of the first of these classes have been found in EB II hearths at Beycesultan and at Tarsus.3 Survivals of this type of " horns " are also found in Late Bronze Age [hereafter LB] Kusura C and Beycesultan III-II.4 The second class consists of the pot-stands or andirons connected with Khirbet Kerak ware in the 'Amuq, Palestine, north-east Anatolia, and the Caucasus. These pot-stands belong to the Early Bronze [hereafter EB] period in the Kura-Araxes culture, to 'Amuq H, to EB III in Palestine, and to EB III in Tarsus. Fragmentary examples of this type date from the Copper Age at Alishar, and LB examples are known from Kusura. Finally, the third class comprises a series of objects which have been uncertainly labelled as either loom-stands, pot-supports, or spit-supports. These date from the period of the Eye Temple at Tell Brak, from Level X and the Hurrian Period at Nuzi,6 from Levels XVI-XII at Mersin,' from Levels XII-VI at Tepe Gawra,8 from the EB period at Alishar,9 from Early Helladic III at Asine,10 and from Beycesultan II.11 One unstratified example comes from Tarsus,12 and a possible member of this class comes from a Middle Cycladic tomb on Amorgos.13 Each of these three classes appears to have a distinct geographical distribu- tion. Class I occurs only in Anatolia, and the relatively scanty evidence indicates a western Anatolian origin for the class. Examples of Class II are found on a 1 M. P.

Specimens of Class III occur on an east-west line ranging from Nuzi 14 to Beycesultan. Examples of all three classes have been found in Cilicia, where the north-south and east-west distribution lines of Classes II and III cross. CLASS I The so-called " shrines " of the EB II phase at Beycesultan (Levels XVI-XIV) contained several " altars " which consisted in part of units resembling the Cretan " horns of consecration ".15 Level XVII, the final EB I stratum, may have had an " altar " of the EB II type, but the preservation was such that a positive identification could not be made. Level XVI has two " shrines ", " A " and " B ". In " A ", the " altar " (Fig. i) consists of a low clay curb forming a three-quarter circle, almost in the middle of which is a small pair of" horns " c. 40 cm. wide and only c. 7 cm. high.

Behind the larger pair of " horns " are small rounded pedestals which served to support them. In " B ", only the curb and a small part of a large pair of " horns " are preserved. In Level XV, there are again two shrines, " A " and " B ". In " A ", a small clay curb forming a three-quarter circle runs into a pair of" horns " c. 60o cm. wide, c. 20 cm. thick, and c. 33 cm. wide. The actual horns of this pair are much more pronounced than those of the smaller pair in " shrine " XVI " A ". Set 15 cm. behind the first pair of" horns " is a second measuring I -77 m. wide, 15 cm. thick, and preserved to a maximum height of 70 cm. in the left-hand horn (Fig. 2). Each of the larger " horns " is " supported by a clay pedestal, into which a large pottery storage jar was built, presumably for the deposit of liquid and other offerings." According to the excavators, a second concentric curb running into the larger pair of " horns " may once have existed. " B " had an " altar " of exactly the same type with the exception that here a second clay curb was preserved. The smaller pair of " horns " was smaller in " B " than in " A ", and the general preservation of " B "s " altar " was poor compared to that of " A ". In Level XIV, the two " shrines " " A " and " B " are divided by a series of rooms, whereas they had been separated by only a wall in Levels XVI-XV. " B " is here better preserved than " A ". The layout of" B "s " altar " (Fig. 3) is the same as that of " B " in Level XV. The smaller pair of " horns " measures 8o cm. by 35 cm. by 40 cm. high. The larger pair is 2 -26 m. wide, 15-16 cm. thick, and is preserved to a height of 50 cm. in the right-hand " horn ". Behind the two larger horns are rectangular pedestals hollowed out at the top to form basins 20 cm. deep. " A "s " altar " was to all intents and purposes the same. Although the Beycesultan "altars" become larger from level to level, their basic design does not change. It is difficult to conceive of the clay curbs as containing anything but an open fire, although the excavators do not mention traces of burning in the areas surrounded by the curbs. At Tarsus, a number of domestic hearths belonging to the EB II period show unmistakably the same fundamental design as the EB II " altars " at Beycesultan, although the specific form the Tarsus hearths take is in most cases rather different.16 Basically, the EB II hearth at Tarsus consists of a raised platform at the back of which, on a ledge, two square blocks rise with a space between them. In front of, and blocking the space between, the two blocks, a brick is stood on its side. The raised blocks are equivalent to the larger pair of" horns " at Beycesultan, while the brick on its side matches the smaller pair of " horns ". The platform as a whole is to be equated with the area delineated by the clay curb at Beycesultan. A list of the EB II hearths at Tarsus follows. In EB IIA, Room 98,17 a hearth such as that described above was found. It differed from the canonical form only in that, at the back behind the blocks, there were two projections. Also, at the front, a roughly semicircular segment of the plat- form had been cut out " possibly to serve like the earlier pits to place the cooking pot... ". The projections at the back may correspond to the pedestals serving as supports for the horns at Beycesultan. In EB IIB, Room 98,1s a typical hearth was found with a platform measuring 16 Although Lloyd and Mellaart make no reference to the Tarsus hearths in their discussion of the Beycesultan " altars ", there can be no denying the close connection between the two. 17 H.

In EB IIF, Room 99,20 a hearth very close to the Beycesultan type (Fig. 4) was excavated. Here, two pairs of " horns " do in fact appear in place of the two blocks and the brick on its side. In the subsequent stratum, a hearth of the standard Tarsus type 21 was built over this horned variety. In the same sublevel, Room 98,22 a standard hearth (Fig. 5) appeared. This was succeeded by an identical hearth which, however, had the edges of the platform raised to form a curb-a feature paralleled at Beycesultan. Finally, in the last phase of this room, a simpler hearth of only platform and back ledge occurs. " The older and more complete type of hearth had been eliminated." FIGo. 4. Tarsus. FIG. 5. Tarsus. EB IIF hearth in Room 99. EB IIF hearth in Room 98. In EB IIIC, II, Room 67,"2 a hearth consisting of a semicircular front with a back ledge in the shape of a pair of " horns " occurs. The excavator describes this hearth as " somewhat reminiscent of Early Bronze II hearths," as indeed it is. From this comparison of the Beycesultan " altars " and the Tarsus hearths, it is apparent that the two are identical in design if not exactly the same in shape. The fact that the Tarsus hearths are purely domestic in character would suggest that the Beycesultan fixtures, even if occurring in " shrines ", may have no cultic signifi- cance,24 and may therefore be simple hearths rather than altars. The excavator at Tarsus suggests that the brick on its side in front of the rear ledge of the Tarsus hearths served " for support of the cooking pot." 25 Quite possibly, the smaller pair of " horns " in the Beycesultan hearths served the same purpose. To sum up, the " horns " of Class I are associated with hearths. Survivals of the EB II " horns " of Class I were found by Miss Lamb in a Late Bronze Age level at Kusura.26 In Room VI, I, a large platform (Fig. 6) of sun-dried 19 ibid., 19 and fig. 43- 20 ibid., 26 and figs. 84-5- 21 ibid., fig. 86. 22 ibid., 26-7 and figs. 65-7. 23 ibid., 36 and fig. xo8. 24 The basis for Lloyd's identification of the Beycesultan buildings as " shrines " is the finding of marble figurines and votive pottery in these buildings. The Tarsus parallels to the Beycesultan " altars " suggest, however, that the Beycesultan " altars " may have been derived from domestic hearths. A personal communication from Professor Lloyd inclines the authors to accept his identifica- tion of the fixtures in the Beycesultan EB II " shrines " as altars, but we would still maintain that such a usage for the fixture was derived from a usage as a hearth. 25 H.

At the back of this platform, a terracotta pair of " horns ", 27 one side of which is decorated with stamped circles, stood behind a small platform of sun-dried brick. Behind the " horns " was a semicircular hearth. The " horns " are preserved to a maximum height of 47 cm. In other rooms, horn-shaped fixtures occur (Fig. 7) which are also decorated with concentric circles. " These objects may have been hearths: though the soil near them showed no trace of blackening, it was red and rather hard round the terracotta [of the 'horns ']." Beside the actual fixtures, several fragments of " horns " were found.28 Together with the horned 27 This was mistakenly identified by Lamb at first as a column, but she observes "... it is really a larger version of the horn-shaped objects described on pp. 37, 39-" 28 Lamb, op. cit., (supra n. 4), 39 and fig. 17.</page><page sequence="8">154 ANATOLIAN STUDIES objects of Class I certain other objects of the type included in Class II were also found in Kusura C. Some of the fragments mentioned above probably belong to pot-stands 29 as well as to the horned hearths of Class I. At Kusura, then, we may see not only the survival of an EB tradition in hearth construction, but also the importa- tion of pot-stands of a type associated with Khirbet Kerak ware in the Early Bronze Age far to the east. Before we leave Class I, some examples of a hybrid horn-shaped object should be mentioned. These objects, which are combinations of the " horns " of Class I and the pot-stands of Class II, are hearths found in Tarsus, Ktiltepe, and Bitik Hiiyiik in the Middle Bronze Age and in Beycesultan in the Late Bronze Age. The best example of this combination comes from Kiltepe in the Karum II period (Fig. 8).30 FIG. 8. Kuiltepe. Hearth in Karum, Level II. The hearth consists of a raised platform on which is a large fixed pot-stand of Class II type. Inside this larger unit is a smaller portable version of identical shape. In form the hearth belongs to Class II, but in design it belongs to Class I, in which we have seen raised platforms and units of similar shape but different size placed one before the other. In the Middle Bronze [hereafter MB] A level at Tarsus, the same type of hearth appears,31 but in this case without the smaller portable unit within it. In front of it is a semicircular platform with a raised curb at its edges. As at Kuiltepe, this hearth had three knobs on the interior, one on each side and one on the back, which the excavator interprets as supports for a pot. An example of the same type from Bitik Hiiyiik in the Hittite period is known.32 Finally, LB specimens of the same type were found in houses (called " shrines " by the excavators as in the case of the EB " shrines ") of Beycesultan III-II.33 The excavators' description of the Level III hearth also applies to that of Level II: " The shrine-structure consists of a pair of curiously shaped terracotta horns, projecting from a small detached screen- wall. ... The horns are decorated with stamped ornament in the form of concentric 29 For a reconstructed version of such a pot-stand, see W. Lamb, " Some Early Anatolian Shrines " AS VI (I956), 87-94, fig. i. 30 T. Ozgiiq, " Excavations at Kiiltepe. Level II Finds ", Belleten XIX (1955), 453-61, fig. 4- 31 H.

Mellaart, op. cit., (supra n. 4), io8-io and pls. 24-5, fig. 7. The close resem- blance between these hybrid hearths and the Class I types of Kusura C imply a similar function. By the same token, the resemblance between these late Beycesultan hearths and the example from Bitik Hiiyiik, also in western Anatolia, link the " altars " of Beycesultan to simple domestic hearths (see supra n. I5). For fragments of other hybrid hearths from Beycesultan, see the same authors, AS V. (1955), 44-5-</page><page sequence="9">HORNED OBJECTS IN ANATOLIA AND THE NEAR EAST I55 circles. ... The low platform on which the horns stand projects some distance in front of them to form a hearth ". The combination of the Kusura C arrangement with " horns " derived from Class II pot-stands is clear. The Beycesultan LB " horns " are probably directly influenced by the earlier MB hearths at Ktiltepe, Tarsus, and Bitik Hiiytik. CLASS II T. N. Chubinishvili, the Georgian archaeologist, was the first to realize the spacial and temporal distribution of the type of hearth furniture which we call Class II.34 His collection 35 is limited to the examples widely known as " pot- stands ", " andirons ", or " fenders ".36 We have included instances when this form was fused with another (see above), such as at Kiiltepe, and also possible Late Bronze Age survivals as indicated by Winifred Lamb's reconstruction of an " andiron " from fragments at Kusura C,37 and an example from Tarsus LB I levels. Our map shows the distribution of the Class II pieces. The catalogue is meant to include relevant in- formation on all published fragments of " pot-stands ". However, the inaccessibility of much of the Georgian and Transcaucasian material is one obstacle to complete- ness. Another is the scanty publication of Early Bronze Age material from Palestine. Constant mention is made of the Palestinian " andirons". Yet only the fragments from Beth Shan and Beth Yerah (and a possible " pot-stand " from Tell 'Ay) have actually appeared (see below). From the information in the catalogue, we can easily see what a close-knit group Class II is. All examples are of the same material, and many are from the same type of clay as the Khirbet Kerak pottery contexts in which they are found. With the exception of the fixed hearth at Ktiltepe, there is no significant variation in dimen- sion. Chronologically (with the above-mentioned exception), they fall within the Early Bronze Age. The problems of dating any group of material so widely distri- buted are always great. Here, the Palestinian and Syrian examples have a relatively firm basis, as do the central and western Anatolian ones. However, the chronologies of eastern Anatolia and the Caucasus are, for the most part, terra incognita. To attempt to date Class II " horns " any more exactly than the scheme in the catalogue would be meaningless. Even so, one can detect a general chronological priority of the northern examples, which indicates a north-south movement of some sort. Most significant for our purposes is the fact that all the examples predate the Middle Minoan-" 2000 horizon", perhaps by as much as 300 years (the Palestinian EB III period is generally dated c. 2600-2300 B.C.).38 It remains to comment upon the contexts within which some of our examples are found. There are remarkable parallels even here. Geographically, the material falls into three general areas: Transcaucasia and Eastern Anatolia, Central and Western Anatolia, and Northern Syria and Palestine. The overall problem of the so-called " Khirbet Kerak Culture " and its distribution is not a direct concern of this paper. 34 T. N. Chubinishvili, " The Interconnections Between the Caucasian (" Kura Araxes ") and the Near East Cultures in the Third Millennium," Contributions to the Archaeology of the Soviet Union..., The Russian Translation Series of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard University, vol.

Albright in Chronologies in Old World Archaeology (Chicago, 1965), 57.</page><page sequence="10">156 ANATOLIAN STUDIES It has been discussed elsewhere.39 However, the implications of the distribution of the Class II " horns " on some of the various arguments will be mentioned. Chubinishvili has proposed the term " Kura-Araxes Culture " 40 for the body of material from Transcaucasia that used to be termed, by B. A. Kuftin and others, simply " eneolithic ".41 The fertile crescent of the Kura-Araxes basin apparently contains a large number of such settlements, spaced at regular 2-4 km. intervals.42 One outstanding cultural characteristic of this culture is " the hand-made black pottery, sometimes so highly burnished as to impart metallic glimmer to the surface, with a peculiar pink lining ".43 There are also characteristically decorated, with pendant spirals moulded in relief, grooved and incised design, or a combination of both.44 It seems that there is a sufficiently high cultural uniformity to allow recogni- tion of even unstratified material as belonging to this culture, purely on typological comparisons. The horseshoe-shaped hearth stands of our Class II are also a standard cultural trait. In Transcaucasia, they vary widely in decoration, although in measurement and material they are quite similar. At Amiranis Gora, all the centre- piece fragments have anthropomorphic decoration. In his article on the Kura- Araxes culture in general, Chubinishvili includes a drawing of a whole stand, which does not appear in the site report.45 The fragments published from the site (Fig. 9) were found in a room, possibly a burial chamber,46 associated with the highly burnished black pottery, some decorated with the pendant spirals.47 The excavator speculates that the stands with anthropomorphic centrepieces may personify idols with libation jars on their heads.4s The end fragments of the stands do not seem to be sculpted at Gora, as they are elsewhere. A fragment from Fig. 9a is remarkably similar to a fragment of a Class II piece from Alishar I, as we shall see. Earlier work by B. A. Kuftin on Mt. Ararat yielded Kura-Araxes material below what seems to be Urartian levels.49 Among the material from the former were fragments of horseshoe hearth pieces (Fig. o). The complete example has a handle at the rear, which is a common feature of this class, but no well-defined centrepiece. Kuftin published other examples from what are assumed to be Kura-Araxes sites: Nakhichevan, Karakurt, Armavir, and Shengavit (Fig. 46). The two anthropomor- phic examples from Shengavit he assumes to be women, perhaps representations of a mother-goddess type, with the legs of the horseshoe representing the embracing arms.50 It is interesting speculation, but there seems little other evidence for such an 39 Partial bibliography of the Khirbet Kerak problem: see S.

The example from Karakurt is compared to pieces from Early Bronze Age Alishar,5' which we consider to be of our third category (see below). There is a similarity in profile, but the " horns " from Alishar are essentially two-dimensional, and thus seem more fitted to serve as " loom-stands " or some like function. Kuftin devotes several pages to making a connection between his hearth pieces and the Minoan " horns of consecration ".52 We believe that the tradition of hearth furniture is related, but that more specific parallels are with our Class I, than with Class II. In his general chronology of Georgia, D. M. Lang equates the " eneolithic culture of Transcaucasia " of Piotrovsky, Burney's " east Anatolian Early Bronze Age culture ", Gimbutas' " Transcaucasian Copper Age Culture " with Chubinish- vili's Kura-Araxes culture.53 The proposed dating for the period is c. 3000-2200 B.C., corroborated by the two C14 dates available for the area: 4880 ? 90 and 4760 o 90 B.P. for the Chalcolithic levels at Ktiltepe and Kvats Kheleki respectively.54 A variant on this type of Class II hearth stand is found in examples from Karaz Hiiytik, near Erzerum (Fig. i1). These are from Early Bronze Age levels. None have anthropomorphic representations. Four of them seem closest in form to several pieces from the Tiflis museum published by Kuftin.55 However, the poor quality of the photograph of the latter prevents any detailed comparison whatsoever. Fig. I Ia actually may be closest to a " pot-stand " from the LB I level at Tarsus (Fig. I Ig). The latter, however, is supposed to have had three projecting " horns " from the centre 56 and two legs, features which the Karaz " andiron " does not have. At Tarsus there is a fragment of a handle from the rear of a " pot-stand " (Fig. I If). Khirbet Kerak ware in the 'Amuq is contemporary with the EB II period at Tarsus. This fragment is from the EB III level, so in this sense is an anomaly, as we shall presently see. Although the published examples are very few, many fragments of Class II " horns " are reported in the Syro-Palestinian area. Here, as in the Kura-Araxes culture, they are tied closely to a highly burnished, handmade red and black pottery with a peculiar set of decoration and ornamentation-Khirbet Kerak ware. As noted above, the distribution of this pottery has been interpreted variously. Most writers on the subject agree that it can be tied to a particular ethnic group of people, but the exact place of origin, as well as the precise manner in which it was spread, is not agreed upon. One should note that Burney finds its source in eastern Anatolia,57 while Chubinishvili derives it from the Kura-Araxes basin.58 Lang's interpretation 59 seems to best fit the evidence provided by our catalogue. Ruth Amiran discusses eight characteristics ofthe Khirbet Kerak culture which she finds pertinent to the material from the Palestinian third Early Bronze Age period.60 The eighth is the hearth stands. Direct parallels for some of the other traits, such as the pot lids with knobs, are easily found among the Kura-Araxes material.6' It is also 51 ibid., 8I and P1. 17, I and 5. 52 ibid., 81-3- 53 D.

Pottery from Kusura is compared with examples from Affula,63 although no Early Bronze Age " andirons " come from the former. In Palestine, as in Transcaucasia, the use of a handmade, non-painted ceramic in contrast to a tradition ofwheelmade painted pottery is unusual.64 There is little doubt that the burnished pottery and associated andirons are an intrusion of some kind upon local traditions. ."~c ~ B q'l _ /1 (a) (b) (C) .: (e) (d) / ' 6?

Although he found a number of what he assumed were " cooking holes ",65 none of the " pot-stands " which he conjectures to have been set over them were actually found in such a position.

However, he reports finding " hundreds " of similar fragments. Their average measurements are: width across front, 150 mm; height of front feet, I Io mm.; height of centrepieces, I Io mm. This conforms well with measurements of other Class II examples. Many examples are smoke-blackened, but Braidwood thinks this is as likely to occur in manufacture as in use." In Palestine itself, material is much more scanty. From the EB III period at Tell 'Ay there is one example of an atypical " fender " (Fig. I4a), in that it seems to have no anthropomorphic features. The smallness of scale prevents much else being said about it. At Beth Yerah (Khirbet Kerak itself) and Beth Shan only four fragments have been published (Fig. 15). However, both fragments from Beth Shan are from a single " andiron ". A reconstruction has been made, which is presently at the University Museum, Philadelphia, awaiting publication. Its dimensions are in the catalogue. If the reconstruction is correct, the " andirons " were of a somewhat fragile nature. The lowness would prevent much of a fire beneath the pot, unless the fire were in a pit or depression over which the " andiron " was set. No context of any of the " andirons " of this class provides definite evidence for either a " secular " or a 66 M.

As we shall see, such a distinction is probably not a meaningful one. Turning to Anatolia, we find in the Karum II level at Kiiltepe a large, fixed hearth " andiron " enclosing a smaller " portable " one (Fig. 8). The relation of its spacial configuration to the Class I examples has already been described. There is little doubt of the portable " andiron's " resemblance to the smaller Class II type. One would also expect a hybrid formation to be later chronologically, as indeed it is. Miss Amiran long ago noted the similarities between several fragments of" spit- supports " from Alishar I (Fig. 16) and the Khirbet Kerak stands.70 An even closer comparison can be made between Fig. I6a and a fragment from Gora (Fig. 9a). The Copper Age at Alishar (level I4-I3T) is assigned by Miss Mellink to her Troy I period, beginning c. 2700.71 Again we see a chronological priority for the Kura- Araxes material. I "I (a) (reconstructed) (b) FIG. 17. Kusura. Finally, we have some fragments from Kusura C (Fig. I 7a) from which a hearth stand is reconstructed, roughly similar to the Class II type (Fig. I7b).72 The existence of a Late Bronze Age survival at Kusura, where fine examples of Class I examples co-exist, not only strengthen an argument for Anatolian origins for the Minoan hearth furniture, but for our classification of the material as well. CLASS III The canonical shape of the horned objects of Class III is a simple pair of " horns " which tilt forward. Some examples have handles or holes which indicate that they were intended to be portable objects. Some have a base or a stand, and 70 R. Amiran, op. cit. (supra n. 36), 99-ioo. The Alishar fragments appear in H. H. von der Osten, op. cit. (supra n. 9), fig. ioo (e 1732), fig. 183 (d 1683), and fig. 205 (e 607, e 858, e I283a). 71 M. J.

Despite these differences, these objects form a homogeneous class and were almost certainly all used for the same purpose. When compared to the examples of Class I, the " horns " of Class III have a far wider range in both time and space. The earliest specimens date from the Middle and Late Chalcolithic of Mersin. In Level XVI, Room 166, an example (Fig. 18) was found in connection with a domed oven.73 The two horns rise from the back of a rectangular base, and a single vertical handle running from the saddle between the horns to the front of the base makes the piece portable. A fragment from Level XIV, Room 165,74 has no horn preserved (Fig. 19). In this case, the horns rise and point forward from an elliptical base. No handle appears to have been attached. A second fragment, from Level XIII, Room 163,'7 has no horn preserved (Fig. 20), and its identification as a horned object by Garstang is questionable. The fragment consists only of a handle from which a second handle projects. Finally, in Level XIIB, Room I 12,76 an example of the canonical Class III type was found (Fig. 21). It measures c. 20 cm. wide, c. 15 cm. high, and c. I I cm. thick at the base. The horns project forward and a vertical handle is restored at the back towards the base. The excavator concludes about these objects: " It seems probable that they were used as supports for cooking pots, and that the space between the horns was designed to permit the flame of the fire to circulate freely." A hearth (Fig. 22) from Level XVIII 77 is in the shape of an open semicircle. The height at the opening is c. 40 cm. and from there the rim of the hearth slopes down to a level of c. 35 cm. at the back. From the front this hearth would appear horn-shaped and so it is included in this discussion; however, it is unlikely that it has any connection with our three classes of " horns ". The " horns " found in the Ubaid and Gawra levels at Tepe Gawra are best described by the excavators. From Levels XII-IX (Fig. 23), Tobler remarks: The double-horned clay objects have flat bases, nearly circular in plan, with one side flattened. The horns are always set, not in the centre, but above the straight edge of the base. . . . These objects are usually pierced diagonally in three places, with double piercings below the horns on both sides of the object, and a group of three piercings in front. One of the Stratum XII horned objects, however, had horizontal rather than diagonal holes, which extend only 50 mm. inside the object. Moreover, it possessed only two pairs of holes, one pair in each side.78 Six of these objects were found in the above levels. Tobler does not suggest a specific usage for them, except to say that they were probably cult objects. However, if their use was the same at Gawra as at Mersin, they were more likely domestic than ritualistic. Regarding the seven " horns " from Gawra Levels VIII-VI (Fig. 24), Speiser remarks about one: " Most significant perhaps is the specimen unearthed in the course of our first campaign. It came up in R. 802, just in front of the entrance leading to R. 8o 01, and its occurrence in the Eastern Temple is thus an indication of the ritual character of this type of object ".79 The illustrated example of the type occurring in the upper levels at Gawra differs from Tobler's description of the earlier 73J.

Here (Fig. 24), the two horns branch off from a thicker stem or stand, the base of which is not preserved. The evidence for the object's " ritual character " is, needless to say, not overpoweringly strong. In Nuzi, horned objects were found not only in the " Prehistoric " Level X, but also in the Hurrian levels. Of the earliest piece (Fig. 25), Starr observes: " The second type of clay object is a large block, slightly hardened by fire, and having two projections or horns on the upper surface. ... Only one was found, made of partly purified clay, blackened by use; it is from Level X ".80 He goes on to note that there was no evidence for a ritualistic use of the object, and suggests, on the basis of modern parallels, that the object served as a loom-stand. However, the very fact that he stresses in his description of the object that it was " slightly hardened by fire " and " blackened by use " would indicate that the object was connected with a hearth. The two illustrated Nuzian examples from the Hurrian period (Figs. 26-27) 81 are somewhat different in form. From a rather tall, thick base, two slender horns project forward. Impressed holes on the sides of one example (Fig. 26) make the object easily portable. A single pair of " horns " was " found in debris from the South end of the Eye Temple platform " 82 at Tell Brak (Fig. 28). The object is quite small: base 7 -7 cm. height 9 cm. It is, however, almost identical with the Level XIIB " horns " from Mersin, except that it has no handle. In the Early Bronze levels at Alishar, several examples of" horns " were found (Fig. 29). They were particularly common in Level 6M.83 These are again of the canonical type with horns projecting forward and a vertical handle at the back. An unstratified pair of " horns " from Tarsus (Fig. 30) is also of the standard type except that it lacks a handle and has a hole bored in front.84 It probably is to be assigned to the Early Bronze period because of its resemblance to the specimens from Alishar, Tell Brak, and Mersin. The excavator identifies it as a loomstand purely on the basis of the Nuzi examples. Pairs of " horns " were found on gypsum pavements in the LB Level II at Beycesultan.8s These are of the standard type (Fig. 31) without handle, but with an impressed hole in front of, and just below, the saddle between the " horns ". They are referred to as " spit-holders " by the excavators, but are more probably to be interpreted, following Garstang, as pot supports for a hearth. This identification is proven beyond question by a later report of excavations in Beycesultan Level II.8 Here, in connexion with a hybrid hearth of Classes I-II, a pair of Class III " horns " was found used as a pot support. Describing the right-hand " shrine " of Level II with its horned hearth, the excavators note: ... The terracotta horns had been broken off short in antiquity. ... A new feature here was a recess on the right-hand side of the horns [i.e. Class I-II hearth], containing the fragments of a large cooking pot, which had been standing poised upon a small fixed column of baked clay maintained in place by the broken half of a terracotta " andiron " [i.e. Class III " horns "] of a type found elsewhere in this level, usually associated with domestic shrines . . . Beneath it were the ashes of a fire containing some animal bones... 80 R. F. S. Starr, op. cit. (supra n. 6), 363 and P1. 39, Z 1-2. 81 ibid., 443 and P1. I 18, A 1-2 and B 1-2. 82 M. E. L.

This class of" horns ", then, survives in much the same way as did the Early Bronze hearths of Tarsus and Beycesultan. Two horned objects from the Aegean outside Crete should be mentioned in conjunction with Class III. The first is a coarse pottery pair of " horns " (Fig. 32) similar in general shape to the later Gawra " horns ". It was found in a bothros in association with EH III pottery at Asine,87 and is identified by the excavators as a brazier. The second is a strange piece (Fig. 33) from Amorgos,88 apparently FIG. 32. Asine, EH III. FIG. 33. Amorgos. Middle Cycladic. FIG. 34. Tepe Hissar. Level IIA. Scale I : 2. belonging to the Middle Cycladic period and found in a cist grave. The hollow object is decorated on the front with two eye-shaped holes and an added clay strip with impressed decoration. In the saddle between the " horns " is a hole, as if the object served as a vessel. Finally, the plan of the object is semicircular with two projecting flanges at the back. Whether the " horns" tilt forward or not is not clear from the drawing. This pair of " horns " may have served as a brazier, but a certain identification without comparable material is difficult. It is unlikely to have been a pot-support, and is mentioned here solely because its shape is comparable to Class III " horns ". The evidence for domestic, rather than ritualistic, use of the " horns " of Class III is almost overwhelming. Only at Tepe Gawra and Beycesultan are cultic usages suggested for these objects, and at neither site is real proof of this hypothesis present. We may definitely conclude that Class III " horns " are associated with hearths and are to be identified as pot-supports rather than loom-stands. Class III seems to have originated in eastern Anatolia and northwestern Mesopotamia, and spread to the west where it was in use in Late Bronze Age western Anatolia. 87 0. Fr6din and A. W.

Sealings from Levels XII and XIA at Tepe Gawra (Fig. 35) portray what is quite reasonably interpreted by Tobler as a horned altar.90 The altars are square with three vertical triangular projections on top. The front of one of these altars appears to be ribbed or grooved. A similar type of horned object is known from Cretan sealings,91 but no objects resembling the glyptic representations were found at Gawra. It is possible that these horned projections represent pot-stands of Class II seen from head on. FIG. 35. Tepe Gawra. Level XII (left), Level XIA (right). Scale I : I. Finally, Iron Age pot-stands have been mentioned to the authors by R. S. Young as appearing in Phrygian Gordion; and Middle Bronze age examples by R. H. Dyson at Dinkha Tepe. The latter have theriomorphic decoration, similar to the example from Shengavit (supra). CRETAN " HORNS OF CONSECRATION " The following discussion of Minoan " horns " will be limited to actual " horns " which have been found on Crete, and will not include all the representations of " horns " which appear increasingly frequently on Minoan seals, reliefs, frescoes, and vases in the Late Minoan period, except in so far as the latter may offer some clue as to the function of Minoan " horns ". By far the earliest Minoan " horns " known is the clay pair from Mochlos (Fig. 36) dating to the Early Minoan I period.92 The plan of the " horns " is crescentic, and hence the object cannot be identified as a boat. Because of the cultic significance of later " horns " this early specimen has been termed a votive offering. However, Persson has justly criticized this view: " .. . The Mochlos horns belong to a collection of objects which is certainly interpreted as a votive deposit-surely chiefly on account of the horns-but which also contains coarse vases, spoons, etc., more fit for simple, ordinary use ".93 The crescentic plan would parallel the plans of Class III " horns " (i.e. those from Alishar and Tarsus, for example), but the horns themselves on the Mochlos object are quite different from those of Class III.

Except for the Mochlos pair, all other securely datable " horns " found on Crete belong to the late Middle Minoan III or Late Minoan periods. These vary in size from the colossal limestone " horns " (Fig. 37) found near the south entrance to the Palace of Knossos,94 to the series of miniature " horns " from Roussolakkos near 4 A. J. Evans, The Palace of Minos at Knossos, II (London, I928), fig. 81.</page><page sequence="27">HORNED OBJECTS IN ANATOLIA AND THE NEAR EAST 173 Palaikastro (Fig. 38).95 The " horns " are made of stucco-faced clay, terracotta, or stone (limestone or poros). All of the " horns " come from the north or east of Crete, none having been discovered at Phaistos, Hagia Triada, or elsewhere in the Mesara (although artistic representations of " horns " have been found at Hagia Triada).96 Most of the actual " horns " found are of a standard type adequately illustrated by Fig. 37. There are, however, a couple of" horns " which have some peculiarities. For example, the pairs of " horns " from the Shrine of the Double Axes at Knossos have sockets in the saddle between the horns,97 a feature which we have observed in the Beycesultan and Tarsus " horns " of Class III. Whether these holes served as sockets for double axes, as Evans claimed, or a as finger-hole to ensure portability, or as socket for a shaft which would serve as a third support for a pot sitting between the horns, is uncertain. A pair of " horns " from the Idaean Cave (Fig. 39) is peculiar in that it has raised knob between the horns and is decorated anthropomorphically. 98 This peculiarity is paralleled closely in the treatment of the Class II pot-stands. At least two functions of the Minoan " horns of consecration " can be deter- mined from the " horns " which have actually been found. The first of these is clearly its use as a cult object. This function cannot be denied in the face of the evidence from both the Shrine of the Double Axes already referred to and the House of the Fetish Shrine.99 However, this usage may be fairly late, since both of the shrines in which this function is attested date from late in the LM period. The second usage of the " horns " is as an architectural member. A fragment of a pair of " horns " was found on the pavement of the Central Court at Knossos where it had apparently fallen from the parapet of the terrace above.100 A terracotta pair of "horns " was found in the angle between two stairways at Gournia, its position indicating that it had fallen from above.'0' This function of the " horns " as an architectural member is amply corroborated from artistic representations of the " horns " on frescoes, steatite relief vases, etc. The findspot of the large " horns " from Nirou Khani, namely built into a recess in the wall of the paved courtyard in front of the building, does not allow a precise identification of its function.'02 Two further functions of the Minoan " horns " are indicated by artistic representations of the object. A steatite pyxis fragment (Fig. 40) from Knossos 103 shows a brick-built base upon which rests a pair of" horns ". A miniature gold-foil replica of an altar found in Grave Circle A at Mycenae 104 shows a pair of " horns " on an altar decorated with the familiar two half-rosettes. Two seals, one from the Idaean Cave (Fig. 41) 105 and one from the Vaphio Tholos (Fig. 42) 106 show "horns " resting on bases which are generally identified as altars. On each seal branches are shown growing out of the saddle between the horns. This usage of the " horns " has been noted in the Gawra sealings. 95 R. C.

The evidence for this function comes entirely from seals and con- sequently is not as extensive as that for other usages. Nevertheless, there is evidence, and its implication for the origin of the Minoan " horns " is most important. A clay seal impression from Knossos (Fig. 43) 107 shows a seated figure pouring the contents of a vase into a large amphora which rests on the saddle between the projections of a pair of " horns ". A Minoan lentoid seal (Fig. 44)108 shows a beaked ewer of the type frequently portrayed on talismanic bead-seals resting again between the pro- jections of a pair of " horns ". Finally, there are several talismanic bead-seals on which, besides the standard ewer and floral ornament, there are schematized " horns of consecration " (Fig. 45), although on these particular seals the ewers are not placed between the " horns ". CONCLUSIONS Of the three classes into which the Anatolian and Near Eastern horned objects have been divided, Class I is at present limited to Beycesultan and Tarsus, at least in the Early Bronze Age.

Distribution of Class II. almost invariably associated with Khirbet Kerak ware, is distributed along a north- south line from Transcaucasia into Palestine with the earliest examples apparently coming from the north of this line. Class III is not as homogeneous as the first two 107 ibid., fig. 376b. 108 ibid., fig. 375a.</page><page sequence="30">176 ANATOLIAN STUDIES classes, and consequently generalizations about its distribution and origins are somewhat out of place. We may, however, note that up to and including the Early Bronze Age it is not found west of Central Anatolia (with the exception of the Asine example), but that by the Late Bronze Age it has spread to the west where several examples were found at Beycesultan. The identification of all three classes as articles of hearth furniture seems fairly certain. Undoubtedly, the examples of Class II served as pot-stands, while the LB Class III example from Beycesultan clearly served the same purpose. Class I " horns " from Tarsus were certainly hearth units, and possibly included a pot- support function. The context of the Beycesultan units demonstrates an elaboration of the ritual function which does not seem present at Tarsus. Such an elaboration does not, however, deny their derivation from a previous or contemporary secular usage. It may perhaps indicate that the distinction between ritual and secular func- tion was not, then, so distinctly drawn. Our final suggestion that the Minoan " horns of consecration " are connected in some way with one of our three classes (probably Class I) is just that-a suggestion. The evidence to prove such a hypothesis is at present lacking. Nevertheless, the hypothesis is not without foundation. To believe that the Minoan " horns " was a purely Minoan invention is, we feel, too parochial. Its constant identification as an object of religious ritual has led some to identify " horns " found in Anatolia as religious artifacts. It is in an effort to combat this misleading trend that we have suggested a possible alternative-that the Minoan " horns " were in fact derived from a domestic object found frequently outside of Crete. 109 CATALOGUE Dimensions Site in metres Material Level/Context Date GORA Fragments of anthro- Ht., o0088 Baked clay Kura Araxes cultural 3000-2700 pomorphic centre- material in room with piece highly burnished black pots with pink interiors, some deco- rated with pendant spirals. 5 fragments of anthro- No scale Baked clay ,, ,, 3000-2700 pomorphic centre- piece 2 fragments of heads No scale Baked clay ,, ,, 3000-2700 3 fragments of legs No scale Baked clay ,, ,, 3000-2700 I complete stand No scale Baked clay ,, ,, 3000-2700 TIFLIS 2 non-anthropomor- No scale phic stands in the Museum ARMAVIR I non-anthropomor- Ht., c. o 1I8 Clay " Eneolithic " phic centrepiece fragment I leg fragment Ht., c. 0o 2 Clay " Eneolithic " KARAKURT I complete non-an- Ht., o* 19, Clay " Eneolithic " thropomorphic W., 0o31 stand with handle 109 We specially thank Miss Machteld Mellink and Dr. George Bass for advice and encourage- ment, Miss Sally Herndon for the drawings, and Miss Cynthia Jones for topography.</page><page sequence="31">HORNED OBJECTS IN ANATOLIA AND THE NEAR EAST 177 ARARAT 6 non-anthropomor- - Clay " Eneolithic " phic leg fragments I stand with handle Ht., o 18 Clay " Eneolithic " W., 0 - 31 SHENGAVIT 2 partial " anthropo- No scale Clay " Eneolithic " morphic women " stands I fragment of bulls- No scale Clay " Eneolithic " head leg NAKHICHEVAN 2 end fragments with Ht., o'21 knobs KARAZ HUjYOK 5 complete stands of Ht. 0o07 Early Bronze Age ? varying forms Ht. 0- 22 Ht. o*18 TABARA i partial andiron No scale Baked clay Level III 2600-2400 I centrepiece and I Ht., 0o 13 Baked clay Pit 14, trench B 2600-2400 leg fragment with handle 'AMuQ 3 partial anthropo- Ht., o0 14 Same clay as Period H 2700-2500 morphic stands with Ht., o0 15 Khirbet Kerak handles Ht., o* 15 ware, with fire blackening 9 fragments of anthro- Ht., o 10o pomorphic centre- piece legs (I com- plete) BETH YERAH x Anthropomorphic Baked clay EB III ? end fragment I non-anthropomor- Ht., o0 19 phic end fragment BETH SHAN I reconstructed stand Ht., (face) 0 12 Baked reddish Level XII 2400-2300 W., 0-27 clay with fire L., o 23 blackening TELL 'AY I leg fragment Ht., 0o05 Clay EB III 2600-2400 L., o0o8 KOLTEPE I fixed stand with in- W. 1-5 Baked Clay Karum II 1900oo-800oo interior portable insert TARSUS I partial non-anthro- Ht., o0 12 Baked clay L Bronze I pomorphic stand W., 0o24 I fragment of centre- Ht., 0oog09 Baked clay EB III piece with handle ALISHAR 3 fragments ofanthro- W., 0o0o8 Baked clay Stratum I 2700-2500 pomorphic centre- pieces 3 fragments of legs - - with knobs KUSURA 6 possible end frag- - Baked clay Level C Late ments of stands Bronze Age P</page></plain_text>
