<plain_text><page sequence="1">Heroic Hype, New Style: Hollywood Pitted Against Homer * PETER GREEN Xew things are more potentially embarrassing than the obstinate survival of archaic beliefs?whether so cial, religious, or mythical?into an era of middle-class ur ban morality. We tend to assume that our own age of heightened political consciousness (feminist, post-colonial, you name it) has a monopoly on this kind of confrontation. Far from it. The disruption of supposed eternal verities by the advance of human social evolution has been going on, in one way and another, since the dawn of civilization. One of the most remarkable examples known to me is the way Homer, Hesiod, and their successors?from thinkers like Xenophanes of Kolophon through the Greek tragedians to the allegorists of the Hellenistic age?dealt with the heroic yet appalling legacy of their own Mycenaean past. Here was a society in which women were treated as chattels, with a slight mark-up, in terms of usefulness, from cattle. Warfare, between a number of small and limited fiefdoms, was the chief occupation and source of prestige; its object was booty, with women, cattle, precious metals (worked or raw), and expensive fabrics high on the list. Competitive warlords maintained relationships by exchanging these, along with mutual hospitality, as guest-gifts. Piracy was a legitimate oc cupation; working for others was not.

It was not unheard of to use poisoned arrows, or even to scoop out and eat the brains of your dead enemy. On the other hand (think of Glaukos and Sarpedon) blood-relationships could sometimes override military allegiances. Watching over this cut-throat raiders' world was a divine pantheon the solipsistic nihilism of which outdid anything on earth. The Olympian gods were a clear wish-fulfilment of the patriarchal society that had created them: deathless and trouble-free, self-indulgent to a degree, spitefully competi tive: the female deities sly and jealous mischief-makers, the males polyphiloprogenitive studs. At the same time their power over mankind was absolute, and they exercised upon mortals the same arbitrary and amoral whims that marked their dealings with one another. Justice reposed in the fiat of Zeus, which had about as much to do with principle as a lot tery. You made offerings to the gods in the hope of placating them, and tried to tiptoe about without bumping into them, as though they were high-power cables. The notion of virtu ous living as a road to divine favor never entered anyone's head?would, indeed, in this archaic Bronze Age world, have been laughed out of court. The gods were the unassail able easy-livers, but also prone to bouts of terrifying and un predictable fury. Their general indifference to human concerns was matched only by their ruthless treatment of mortals who, most often accidentally, got in their way or otherwise offended them. When they so chose, their control over human motives and actions was absolute. Gloucester's grim apophthegm in King Lear says it all: "As flies to wan ton boys, are we to the gods:/ They kill us for their sport." Now by Homer's day, four or five hundred years later, var ious aspects of this bleak world-view were already coming under fire. As Gilbert Murray pointed out, in The Rise of the Greek Epic, there are certain unpleasant details, like those poisoned arrows, cannibalism on the battlefield, or (with one exception) human sacrifice, that Homer prefers to omit, yet which still leave tell-tale traces behind. Something sub</page><page sequence="3">Peter Green 173 versive, too, is stirring faintly in the archaic social pot: Ther sites alone would suffice to prove that. The concept of women as chattels (still unchanged in Hesiod) has to strug gle, in Homeric narrative, with a new concept of love and companionship in marriage: Laertes avoids sleeping with Eurycleia to avoid offending his wife; Odysseus favors the starry-eyed Nausika? with a tribute to the marital state that can still move even cynics today (experto cr?dite), and he might well have had Hektor and Andromache in mind when he delivered it. Even Helen, a shuttlecock of divine caprice if ever there was one, jibs (in book 3 of the Iliad) at Aphro dite's abrupt order to go service Paris in bed, after the god dess has unceremoniously whisked him away by magic from a losing duel with Menelaos (more of that in a moment). The post-Mycenaean Dark Age was over, trade and travel were picking up in the Aegean, polis society had begun the long climb towards a new kind of self-definition, moral and religious no less than social; and this, inevitably, meant a dif ficult conflict with many of the old landmark traditions and shibboleths. The polis, of course, especially as early as the eighth cen tury BCE, was very far from carrying through, or even con templating, a complete and radical revision of its past. There was far too much traditional narrative locked firmly into place, to begin with: the basic outlines of the Theban cycle, the Argonautic expedition, and, above all, the Trojan War, together with its antecedents and aftermath, were well es tablished. Incidental variations abounded, and increased with time, but the overall pattern was set. Attempts to change it?most notoriously, the claim, by Stesichoros and others, that only an eidolon of Helen ever went to Troy? were clumsy and unconvincing (how does one have sex, or even dinner, with an eidolon}), and significant chiefly as an index of growing moral outrage at the idea of the casus belli not only escaping punishment after so many heroes had died because of her, but ending up (so Homer, wittily, in Odyssey book 4) back in Sparta with Menelaos, entertaining guests</page><page sequence="4">174 HEROIC HYPE, NEW STYLE such as Telemachos with wicked-old-me stories of her wartime activities. Stesichoros lived in the first half of the sixth century, and it was now, especially with the appearance of the early Ionian thinkers, that this new moralizing trend really got under way. Its most notable exponent, Xenophanes of Kolophon, went straight to the heart of the matter by attacking, not the Home ric heroes, but the Homeric gods. He skewered their anthro pomorphism (if pushed, they even go for each other on the battlefield) with an early version of the man-makes-gods-in his-own-image argument; more important, he accused both Homer and Hesiod of attributing to the Greek pantheon such unlovely habits as adultery, theft, and mutual deceit?every thing, he notes, that men regard as blameworthy and repre hensible, ?&lt;kxx 7cap'?v9pciffl;oiGiv ?v??8?a Kai \|/?yoc ?oT?v. This remarkable use of purely human and social criteria to attack enshrined (and by implication eternal) divine entitlement is also slily disingenuous. As Xenophanes must have been well aware, these attributes were not the invention of the poets, but the hallowed tradition they had inherited, and from which they felt they could not diverge. Furthermore, what Xeno phanes, perhaps wisely, left untouched was the overriding, and often brutal, divine control that in the Iliad in particular dictates the entire course of the action. Homer clearly was bothered, as well he might have been, by the role of the gods in precipitating the Trojan War: he makes only one oblique reference, and that in the very last book of the Iliad, to the famous Judgment of Paris. But by awarding the beauty-prize to Aphrodite, Paris not only got Helen (who had no say in the matter) from the grateful god dess as a quid pro quo, but made mortal enemies of her ri vals, Hera and Athena, who frequently refer, in Homer's narrative, to their hatred for Troy, their determination to see the city destroyed, but without explaining why. Poseidon, too, nurses a resentment against the Trojans, but in his case it's because he was defrauded of his hire by the hubristic Laomedon after building Troy's walls for him. Much more</page><page sequence="5">Peter Green 175 detail emerges, about the Judgment of Paris and other mat ters, from the Kypria of Stasinos, where Zeus, too, is given an oddly modern motive for starting this war (and that of Thebes): as a way of dealing with out-of-control over-popu lation. The Kypria is generally less shy than Homer of em phasizing the traditional role of the gods: Aphrodite not only makes Helen incapable of resisting Paris, but briskly sends Paris off on his voyage to Sparta in the first place. Not that Homer is backward in positing divine interven tion at crucial points (even though he plays with anthropo morphism enough to let a mortal, Diomedes, wound a couple of gods, including Ares). When Achilles is on the point of killing Agamemnon during the original quarrel over Chryseis, it is Athena who pulls him by the hair and quietens him down. (This doesn't stop him telling his mother Thetis to petition Zeus for Trojan victories till Agamemnon apolo gizes: Zeus duly obliges.) As Menelaos is dragging off the hapless Paris by his helmet, it is Aphrodite who breaks the strap and wafts her favorite away into his bedchamber, sharply instructing Helen to follow him there. Athena, dis guised, induces Pandaros to shoot the arrow that wounds Menelaos and breaks a hard-won truce. Worse, Apollo, in visible, attacks Patroklos from behind, knocks off his hel met, leaves him dazed and helpless, an easy victim for Hektor's spear. Poseidon mists Achilles' vision while he van ishes Aineias, to preserve Dardanos' royal line. During the final duel between Achilles and Hektor, Athena not only, dis guised as Deiphobos, eggs Hektor on to cast his one spear (having first made Achilles' shield impervious to it), but re turns Achilles' own spear him after his first, unsuccessful, cast, thus sealing Hektor's fate. Even Priam, on his famous visit to Achilles to ransom his son's corpse, is duly magicked in and out of the Greek lines, unobserved, by an obliging Hermes, in the guise of a Myrmidon. Throughout the epic the parti pris squabbling of the gods as they support now the Greek, now the Trojan cause, most often for purely personal motives, makes the human conflict</page><page sequence="6">176 HEROIC HYPE, NEW STYLE look honorable and dignified by comparison. I don't think this was accidental. Homer may have been at the beginning of the struggle to make the Bronze Age legacy acceptable to a new world based on the polis, and thus, as a Big House minstrel, forced to move very cautiously (everyone laughs when Odysseus beats up Thersites), but he was well aware of the huge problems involved. Perhaps one of the cleverest devices he exploited was the revolutionary notion that Fate, whether general or personal (aisa, moira, k?r, whatever), could, in some circumstances, override the otherwise uncon trollable arbitrary whims of these all-too-anthropomorphic Olympians. When it comes to determining Hektor's fate, Zeus weighs the Trojan's k?r against that of Achilles in the scales, thus avoiding a challenge to his own omnipotence. We still have far to go before the Aeschylean search for sov ereign principle, let alone the Hellenistic obsession with T?xn; but emancipation from that awful dominance by a primitive and dysfunctional family of rich, spoiled, blue-blooded im mortals has at least begun. Two and A half millennia later, these problems have not gone away. In many ways, indeed, they have intensified. The Olympian pantheon, despite a last-ditch effort at resus citation by Julian the Apostate, are no longer taken seri ously, let alone regarded as any kind of moving force in human affairs. The divine competition that ousted them in evitably overlaid the Homeric moral climate with new as sumptions of its own. Post-Augustan romanticism has been succeeded by post-Freudian nihilism and post-colonial anti Westernism. Worse, any director, however serious, seeking to reinterpret the Trojan War in cinematic terms is stuck with a movie tradition even more crippling than anything Homer and his successors had to face. As Anthony West re cently remarked in The New Yorker, apropos another big summer movie, "blockbusters are not made to raise aware</page><page sequence="7">Peter Green 177 ness. They are made to raise (a) pulses and (b) cash." With a reported budget of $168,000,000, Wolfgang Petersen, the brilliant and subtle director of Das Boot, who, if anyone, understands the harsh stresses of combat, can never have been allowed to forget the bottom line for long when mak ing Troy. This, among other things, severely hampered his take on the visual realities of Mycenae, Sparta, and Troy itself. It is less appreciated than it should be just how rigidly conven tional the cinematic vision of the ancient world has become: an amalgam based on Victorian art (Leighton, Alma Tadema, the Pre-Raphaelites), the grand opera tradition rep resented by Aida, and, above all, a powerful Egyptianizing trend in the representation of buildings and statuary. The re sult, set in place by early moviemakers from D.W. Griffith to Cecil B. DeMille, was an overwrought never-never land of luxurious, and largely meaningless, public architecture: no dirt, no commerce, no stores, no daily life. I can think of no film-set representing an ancient city that even remotely sug gests a place where people go about their business and con nect with the world outside: they are all simply a conventional background for fighting, feasting, and public emotional grandstanding. Despite all the computerised facil ities for the creation of virtual reality at his disposal?in cluding a faithful, and highly realistic, reconstruction of Troy made for the archaeologist Manfred Korffmann's Troia Projekt?Petersen's Troy follows the same old formula, if on a lavish scale. He gets the external batter walls right (though he makes them over twice their real height), but inside we have the familiar mish-mash of vaguely Egyptian-looking temples, anachronistic art-work (Hittite, Egyptian New Kingdom, Greek archaic, fifth century Athenian, etc.), un der-furnished public courts and a superfluity of empty plat forms. Why, since archaeologists have given us a very good idea of how Troy, and many other cities, actually looked, not to mention what their daily life would involve?something any</page><page sequence="8">178 HEROIC HYPE, NEW STYLE research department could easily find out?do movie-mak ers persist in ignoring them? One answer is suggested by a famous theatrical anecdote. When the Victorian actor-man ager Sir Henry Irving complained to his props manager about the storm-effects being produced during a rehearsal of King Lear in the Lyceum theater, he was told "But Sir Henry, that's a real storm outside." To which he replied, crushingly: "The Almighty's thunder is not necessarily good enough for the Lyceum." As one historian of film has acutely observed,1 The epics' art direction does not take risks . . . Hollywood's coordi nated conception of epic backgrounds was clearly a function of fi nance, because the studio heads believed that big budget films could not risk challenging popular notions of ancient life with revi sionist (or even accurate) visual depictions of the ancient world as foreign, or perilous, or savage, or even dirty. Experienced moviego ers knew what Rome, or Persia, or Greece, or Egypt was supposed to look like, and any film that seriously challenged these traditional preconceptions was not likely to gain popular acceptance or do well at the box office. Hence, I suspect, not only Troy, but a Mycenae temple that resembles nothing so much as the crypt of a mediaeval cathedral, Menelaos's art-deco beer-cellar of a Spartan ban queting-hall, the weird varieties of wraparound dress sported by male characters when they're not in full armor, and perhaps even the totally meaningless, and partly ruined, pseudo-building out in the country, nothing but pillars and architraves, used by Achilles and Patroklos in Troy as a catch-me-if-you-can setting for practice sword-play. The effect of all this, inevitably, is to diminish the serious ness of what the characters are doing and saying. Even Homer's poetry would suffer in this context, and a chewed over populist script doesn't stand a chance. Stanley Kauff mann, in a by no means unsympathetic assessment, for The New Republic, of Brad Pitt's performance as Achilles, re marked slily that "the depth of his acting is at least equal to</page><page sequence="9">Peter Green 179 the depth of the writing." Fear of going beyond the pro jected viewer's mental range, while still striving for some kind of epic grandeur, has left David Benioff's screenplay, for the most part, a string of platitudes, with the characters re minding us and each other, rather too often, that this war and its protagonists would be remembered ever after: a fact we knew already, but one to which Troy's script lends an un expected quality of survival against overwhelming odds. Since the producers and director, probably for the first time in history, had both the budget and the technical resources to achieve whatever effects they wanted in mounting their version of the Trojan War, we have to assume that all the choices they made were deliberate, rather than being forced upon them by the limitations of the medium. So, what does Troy set out to do, how does it utilize Homer and other lit erary sources, not to mention modern archaeology, and to what extent, if at all, does it succeed in recreating this an cient epic myth for a contemporary audience? The most prominent feature of the Iliad, certainly that which takes up the largest proportion of its total text, is the business of hand-to-hand combat, described by Homer with graphic relish, anatomical accuracy, and a vivid blood-and guts expertise about exactly what effect spear-wounds in particular can have (e.g. the still-beating heart of a dead man shaking the butt-end of the spear transfixing him). Just as someone once described the Odyssey as the "eatingest epic", so the Iliad is the fightingest. Here, in a generic sense, Troy scores heavily. David Denby in The New Yorker described it as "easily the best battle film since Saving Private Ryan." The writhing, clanging, claustrophobic close-ups of Greeks and Trojans lunging and hacking at each other like de mented butchers in some nightmare slaughterhouse are cer tainly calculated to raise both pulses and cash, and indeed come pretty close in spots to Homer's narrative. Since this is by a long way the nearest any element in Troy gets to the Il iad, the fact is worth stressing. Petersen seems to have taken to heart that wonderful passage in book 2 likening to flights</page><page sequence="10">i8o HEROIC HYPE, NEW STYLE of geese or cranes or swans by the Kaystrios river the Greeks' tribal contingents as they "streamed out out from their ships and huts onto Skamandros' plain, and the earth rang terribly under the tramp of men and horses." The di rector of photography, Roger Pratt, uses the wide screen, a huge open beach, innumerable extras and computerized spe cial effects to make these armies roll towards one another like vast tidal waves. We're also treated to a panoramic view of what looks to be all 1,186 vessels listed in the Catalogue of Ships approaching en masse over a calm sea. It's only when we start examining these elements in detail that a cavalier indifference to historical Realien, which per vades the entire movie, becomes apparent. Massed cavalry charges are wildly anachronistic (Hektor may have been tamer of horses, but not that many). The rank and file of these armies are far too well drilled and armed, some carry ing shields that look suspiciously Roman. The ships are eighth century pentekonters: fine for Homer, but not for his characters. Equipping Trojans with Hittite armor is reason able, but Corinthian helmets for the Greeks give one pause. The topography is disconcertingly fluid: sometimes there's a ridge between Troy and the sea, sometimes a level sandy plain, a discrepancy clearly dictated by the dramatic needs of the moment. Most revealing of all is the absence of any dis cernible roads leading to or from the city: Petersen's Troy ex ists in solipsistic isolation. This, then, is a scene unconnected to the outside world, and the firmly choreographed mass conflicts that use it as a backdrop have equally little relevance to the fighting in the Iliad. What Homer emphasizes is the precise opposite of these vast engagements in Troy: his concern is rather with the individualism of the aristeia, with battles between he roes, alone or in groups, the ill-armed rabble appealed to by Thersites remaining largely in the background. The result of Troy's large-scale warfare is that even Achilles and Hektor tend to get lost in the ongoing egalitarian melee: which is a pity, because perhaps Brad Pitt's most convincing quality as</page><page sequence="11">Peter Green 181 Achilles is his sheer speed (rc?Sac ?k?c indeed), artistry, and quicksilver play with sword and spear both. We don't have to be told that this is the greatest warrior in the Greek army, a hugely athletic and lightning-swift killing-machine; we can see it for ourselves. Unfortunately, Petersen's delight in his computers' magical ability to present conflict en masse swamps our sense of individual tragic conflict with its mind numbing multitudes, thus destroying one of the Iliad's most powerful motifs. There is, however, one splendid exception, made even more striking by its rarity, and that is Petersen's version of the climactic duel between Hektor and Achilles. The crowds vanish, the plain beneath the great walls is bare, and the embodiments of national honor and individual pride meet in an explosive confrontation as inevitable as it is, practically speaking, insane. If Aristotle was right, and the essence of tragedy can be seen as katharsis through pity and fear, this scene triumphantly vindicated his apophthegm. But it stands alone. We hear a lot about honor, but see little of it: here Troy compares unfavorably with an epic like El Cid, which understood honor well and showed a refreshingly adult approach to it. Unfortunately, Petersen's overall take on the Trojan War, combined with the script's relentless infusion of modern Western (in both senses) moral clich?s, reduces most of this close on three-hour epic to mildly pretentious melodrama, spiced up with an intermittent anti-war message (presum ably to let blood-sport spectators have their cake and eat it) and moments of improbable heterosexual romance. As for Homer's biggest problem, Troy has a lot of talk about the gods, just as it does about eternal fame, but carefully keeps them right out of the action (no Hephaistos, no new armor for Achilles), and, with one disastrous exception, off the screen. The exception is Achilles' mother Thetis, portrayed by Julie Christie (who really deserved something better) as a society matron in the ancient equivalent of a twin-set, re minding us of her marine associations by conducting a con versation with her son while paddling in a seaside rock-pool.</page><page sequence="12">182 HEROIC HYPE, NEW STYLE What is more, there are strong (and again, wildly anachro nistic) suggestions in the dialogue that the leaders of the younger generation?as opposed to oldies, priests, common folk, and other such nerds?know perfectly well that the Olympian religion is a load of codswallop. "How many bat talions has the Sun God?" Hektor asks his father Priam with Stalinist prescience, while Achilles contemptuously (with one stroke of a bronze sword, yet) slashes off the metal head of a crouching statue of Apollo as archer (a premature rip-off, incidentally, of the fifth century Herakles on the east pedi ment of the Aphaia temple on Aigina). This may be a sop to Christian fundamentalists, but it eviscerates the motivation of the Iliad by reducing the expedition to a neocon exercise in secular land-grabbing. And who ever knew, till Troy re vealed it, that Apollo's wrath with the Greeks was due, not to any mistreatment of Chryses (about which we hear noth ing) but, guess what, to the desecration of the god's temple by Achilles and his Myrmidons? Petersen accepts the two-week time-frame of the Iliad, but then proceeds to cram into it the entire ten-year expedition, from Helen's flight from Sparta with Paris to the episode of the Trojan horse and the fall of Troy. (No room here for Penthesilea, and when you think what he could have done with her, be thankful for small mercies.) He paints his his tory with the broadest of brushes and gets most of it wrong. The expedition is treated as part of a great Aegean land grabbing venture by the insatiably ambitious Agamemnon (played with suitable panache by Brian Cox as an over weight, self-indulgent, silky-voiced conquistador). There is much talk of Greece as an entity, something not even dreamed of (despite the Olympic Games) till the Persian wars, and which casts a false light on the coalition of fiercely independent states (even more shaky than the one cobbled together for the recovery of Kuwait) that set out to recover Helen. In particular, it makes Achilles' behavior in rejecting the authority of Agamemnon look a good deal more wilfully eccentric than in fact it was. The compression of time loses</page><page sequence="13">Peter Green 183 altogether the weariness and bad morale produced by a seemingly interminable siege: thus we don't get Agamem non's way of testing the troops by suggesting that the time's come to go home, when instead of giving him an endorse ment for further warfare, they make a concerted rush for the ships. The realistic wide-screen panorama of ships converted into huts suggests that Petersen originally aimed for a lengthier sequence; but Homer's stampede scene (stretched out military service has its modern parallels) would have made any movie mogul as uncomfortable as the Iliad's care ful avoidance of taking sides, the lack of cowboy-style good ies and baddies, black hats versus white. It shouldn't be surprising, then, that Troy revamps Homer's narrative in simpliste, and flatly modern, moral terms, or that this decision was directly responsible for most of the really startling changes to the traditional story-line that caught the attention of even the most blas? and classi cally indifferent reviewers. Like Stesichoros and others, Pe tersen had to deal with the question of Helen's morality; and since he'd discarded the gods as psychological puppet-mas ters, he decided, inevitably, to explain her actions in terms of contemporary secular romanticism. He couldn't play the ei dolon card, so did the next best thing by casting a statuesque blonde German model, Diane Kruger, in the role. Ms Kruger not only had to struggle with some of the script's dumbest lines, but put me in mind of that other actress whom Dorothy Parker credited with running the whole gamut of emotions from A to B. Petersen also set out to make her a sympathetic character to modern feminists by presenting Menelaos (Brendon Gleeson) as a coarse muscle-bound lout twice her age, quite capable of necking with a dancing-girl in her presence, and whose reaction on hearing of her elope ment was a fervent wish to kill her with his own hands. This, of course, gets round the embarrassing tradition that when she and Paris levanted, they took a big haul of rich goodies with them, and that the real casus belli was theft of valuable property, Helen included. You don't kill your tro</page><page sequence="14">184 HEROIC HYPE, NEW STYLE phies when you get them back, you keep them on display. Hence Homer's wonderful sequel in the Odyssey, with Menelaos and Helen, comfortably middle-aged, entertaining visitors in Sparta with reminiscences of Troy?including He len's trick of imitating the voices of various Achaian war riors' wives, to see if they were in fact lurking in the Wooden Horse, and could be tricked into betraying themselves. Not even High Noon could get away with that scenario: so what does Petersen do? He can't kill Helen off: romantics (if not old-guard moralists) would have a fit. Instead, he puts Homer's post-war scene out of court by having Hektor run Menelaos through after the latter's duel with Paris. Baddies must get their comeuppance, so Agamemnon, too, dies, dur ing the sack of Troy, stabbed by Bris?is as he grabs her with a view to a little sexual harassment (to the victor the spoils, etc.). Indeed, I began to wonder, when Petersen had Hektor also kill Ajax (Tyler Mane), whether he didn't perhaps nurse a determination to obliterate all Greek tragedy: there went Aeschylus' Oresteia and one of Sophokles' best plays. Come to think of it, neither Klytemnestra nor Hekabe put in an ap pearance in Troy either. But Petersen compensates to some extent by doing all he can with Hektor (sensitively and sub tly played by Eric Bana, an Australian actor I hope to see more of): the married family man torn between his loyalties to wife and child, renegade brother, and city is a moral proposition that even Hollywood can understand, and Bana, helped by a few Homeric echoes in the script, exploits it for all it's worth. Andromache, incidentally (Saffron Burrows), is tall and dark: someone, at some point, must have read Dictys Cretensis. And one reason for getting in the fall of Troy, apart from spectacle, was, I suspect, to make sure that Achilles, too, didn't escape scot-free after dragging dead Hektor at his chariot-tail. Not quite what John Wayne would have done, that, though I don't doubt that defenders, then as now, would talk about the stress of war or even "let ting off steam": boys will be boys, and in this movie men will, too.</page><page sequence="15">Peter Green 185 The real trouble with Troy, though, is the seemingly end less sequence of anachronisms, improbabilities, irritating factual errors, and what I suppose could be called, politely, basses vulgarisations that permeate its entire fabric, from be ginning to end, making our old friend the suspension of dis belief a more than usually tough business. The Aegean sea laps up just down the steps from the fortress of Mycenae. Agamemnon is called a "sack of wine" by Achilles, an odd locution which suggested to me something incurably leaky (who keeps wine in sacks anyway?). A notice announces THE PORT OF SPARTA, and is followed by a shot of towering vertical cliffs that don't look like any kind of har bor, least of all Gytheion, and incidentally why not name it? Difficulty in pronunciation? Could that be why Achilles' Ph thia is misspelled Phtia? There are the usual eccentricities in the pronunciation of names (Preeam, Pelly-us, etc.), par for the course among people on whose lips such names don't, in the normal course of events, ever figure. During the evening's drinking chez Menelaos in Sparta, Paris and Helen, quite incredibly, slip away upstairs and strip off for an ener getic bonk, unnoticed by anyone except Hektor. Paris next day smuggles Helen into the hold of his ship: this time not even Hektor notices, and where's the send-off required by the Homeric regard for guests? Some of the problems are due to Petersen trying to com bine incidental stabs at symbolism with an otherwise relent lessly realistic movie (his one successful shot here was having the Wooden Horse built out of Greek ships' timbers, a de lightful touch). He wants to make us feel that the spirit of Troy will survive the sack: to do this he introduces the Sword of Troy, a sub-Arthurian and decidedly schmaltzy ob ject nearly lost by Paris when fighting Menelaos, and duly handed over during the looting to Aineias (since Petersen re duces Priam's sons to two, Hektor and Paris, he has to have Paris ask Aineias who he is, even though Aineias is his own kin and belongs to the cadet branch of the royal family). Pe tersen also, perhaps recalling the powerful opening sequence</page><page sequence="16">186 HEROIC HYPE, NEW STYLE of Manciewicz's 1963 Cleopatra, wants to emphasize the dramatic impact of the cremation of dead warriors. Unfor tunately he does this by putting them on elevated biers with hardly enough wood underneath even to crisp them. We're also shown corpses having coins put on their eyes for the Ferryman, even though coins weren't invented for another five hundred years or more. Someone, too, seems to have got very antsy about the tradition of an erotic relationship be tween Achilles and Patroklos: far from Patroklos (Garrett Hedlund) being an older man than Achilles, as Homer knew, Troy turns him into Achilles' teen-age cousin [!], and has Achilles himself endlessly hopping in and out of bed with bimbos, priestesses, etc., like the modern rock stars whom in ways he so resembles. Indeed, he actually develops a gritty passion for Bris?is (Rose Byrne, a determined actress who has to work remark ably hard, in addition to getting repeatedly beaten up, through being saddled with a good deal of business belong ing more properly to Chryseis and Kassandra). The passion culminates as Troy burns (you thought Achilles was killed earlier? shame on you), with Achilles, whacked by Paris the archer not only in the heel but two or three times through the torso, bidding an agonized farewell to Bris?is, the only reason he's still in Troy, for all the world like the dying Jean Gabin seeing off Michelle Morgan in Quai des Brumes ("Embrasse-moi, vite, on est press?"). Meanwhile the Greeks are busily burning the city, not only before they loot it, but while they're still in it, a no-no for any self-respecting sacker. The only other thing they find time to do, even more im probably, as though they were a bunch of Orthodox icono clasts, is to tie ropes round all those anachronistic statues and pull them down. I noted, with wry amusement, that the statues were in fact plaster-of-Paris fakes, and thus crumbled into bits the moment they hit the floor. There's a nice piece of movie symbolism here, but I doubt it was something the director intended. Even Priam's climactic visit to Achilles to ransom his son's body, one of the great scenes in world liter</page><page sequence="17">Peter Green 187 ature that I'd have thought proof against any dumb tinker ing, comes out flat, platitudinous, and slightly melodramatic: this can partly be attributed to the script, but Peter O'Toole as Priam?looking and behaving like a blue-eyed baby boomer who's suddenly come awake to find himself white bearded without ever having bothered to grow up?has to bear some of the blame too. Once again, as so often with movies of Homer, and the ancient world generally (as not with those of Shakespeare, Jane Austen, or Henry James) we've been treated, qua viewers, as semiliterate conventional romantics, this time with a vicarious taste for blood and guts. I still hope to see an adult version of the Matter of Troy one day; but then I always was an incurable optimist. NOTE 1.
