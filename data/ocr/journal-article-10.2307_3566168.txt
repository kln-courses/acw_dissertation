Geogr. Ann. 85 A (3-4): 229-245. ABSTRACT. An ethnoecological study was carried out in the Purhepecha community of San Francisco Pichitaro, west central Mexico, with the purpose of investigating how land degradation, in terms of soil erosion and fertility depletion, was (and still is) handled by indigenous farmers so that traditional agriculture could remain sustainable over centuries. After briefly reviewing opposite views on the land degradation issue in the regional con- text of the Patzcuaro lake basin, the paper focuses on land man- agement at local level. The indigenous concept of land is dis- cussed as an integrated whole, including water cycle, climate, re- lief and soils. Indigenous people venerate land as the mother of all living beings, including humans. Therefore, people's health and survival require good land care and management. Local knowledge on land management is organized around four basic principles: land position, land behaviour, land resilience and land quality. Farmers recognize land as a dynamic subject, a con- cept reflected in the expression 'land moves and behaves'. Soil erosion and fertility depletion are perceived as 'normal' proc- esses the farmers control by means of integrated management practices. Farmers recognize several land classes, primarily con- trolled by landscape position, which require different land care. The example of San Francisco Pichataro demonstrates that tra- ditional agriculture does not necessarily lead to land degrada- tion. But the collective knowledge, or social theory, on land management is increasingly exposed to be fragmented as the community undergoes structural changes and loses its social co- hesion under the pressure of externalities such as off-farm ac- tivities, out-migrations and governmental intervention, among others. Key words: ethnopedology, indigenous people, local attitudes to- wards soil health, local land use systems, mountain landscapes, Mexico Introduction Land degradation in Latin-American highlands is often perceived as resulting from inadequate land management practices implemented by local farmers living in fragile landscapes and exploiting marginal soils under strong climatic variability. In contrast, recent ethnoecological studies show that indigenous land management systems have been sustainable over long periods of time, thanks to (1) their adaptability to political, economic and environmental uncertainties; (2) their flexibility to change, allowing for partial adoption of inno- vations; and (3) the development of strategies that maximize land use in space and time via diversi- fication of crops and practices, while minimizing the use of external inputs (Denniston 1995; Berkes 1999; Denevan 2001). However, indige- nous production systems are increasingly vulner- able to the effects of globalization and are there- fore at the crossroads of sustainability, because the introduction of new farming practices often causes land degradation to increase (Zimmerer 1996; Posey 1999; Assies, et al. 2000; Zoomers 2001). We have carried out an ethnoecological study in the Purhdpecha community of San Francisco Pich~taro, PRtzcuaro lake basin, Michoacin state, in west central Mexico (Fig. 1), with the purpose of investigating how land degradation, in terms of soil erosion and fertility depletion, was (and still is) handled by indigenous farmers so that tradition- al agriculture could remain sustainable over cen- turies thanks to co-evolution of eco- and socio-sys- tems. This paper is derived from a case study in- cluding a semi-detailed geopedological inventory, an analysis of farmers' soil-land knowledge using an ethnographic approach and participatory work- shops, and data integration in a GIS (Barrera- Bassols 2003).

The land degradation issue In the regional context: the Pdtzcuaro lake basin For about 4000 years, farmers of the Pitzcuaro ba- sin (952 km2) have used the traditional multi-crop- ping milpa system, based on the association of maize, beans and squash, and have adapted it to cope with micro-environmental variations in high- lands (West 1947; Watts and Bradbury 1982; Nav- arrete 1990). The Piatzcuaro basin was the centre of the Purh6pecha State from AD 1200 to the Spanish conquest in 1523 and, as such, it was densely pop- ulated already by that time (Gorenstein and Pollard 1983). Population at the beginning of the 16th cen- tury is estimated at 100000 inhabitants. It has been argued that the introduction of agri- culture has caused accelerated soil erosion in the highlands surrounding the PRitzcuaro lake, espe- cially during the period preceding the Spanish con- quest. Lake sediment records show an increase of sediment influx during three periods, which have been correlated with pulsations of anthropogenic soil erosion in the basin (O'Hara 1991; O'Hara et al. 1993, 1994). 1. A first period of soil erosion is recorded between 3600 and 3000 yr BP (1600-1000 BC), coinciding with the appearance of maize in the pollen record and revealing sedentary agriculture in the Pitzcuaro basin by that time (Bradbury 2000). An amount of 2.3 million tons (Mt) of sediments was deposited in the lake during these 600 years. Climate was moist and warm, favouring agricul- tural activities but also triggering soil erosion. Presumably, humans settled in small isolated villages on the lakeshores and islands, although archaeological evidence is scarce (Pollard 1996). 2. During the second period, between 2500 and 1200 yr BP (500 BC-AD 800), soil erosion was more severe than during the first one. A total of 13.4 Mt of sediments accumulated in the lake, at an average rate of 10300 t yr-1. Small agrarian communities consolidated in the lacustrine plains. Moist climate and population increase may have stimulated agricultural activities in the watershed highlands. 3. A third soil erosion period took place between 230 Geografiska Annaler - 85 A (2003) - 3-4</page><page sequence="3">SUSTAINABLE LAND MANAGEMENT IN MEXICO 850 yr BP and the present (AD 1150-2000). Dur- ing the last 850 years, a total of 24.6 Mt of sed- iments accumulated in the lake, at an average of 29000 t yr-'. This reveals increasing land deg- radation, associated with the flourishing of the Purh6pecha State, when the Patzcuaro basin became the political, administrative and cere- monial centre of a vast empire extending over some 75000 km2 (Arnauld et al. 1994). There are no data allowing assessment of changes in soil erosion intensity after the Spanish con- quest until the second half of the 20th century, when soil erosion clearly increased (G6mez- Tagle 1994). In contrast, other studies suggest that the land- scapes in the Pitzcuaro basin remained relatively stable during the thousand years preceding the Spanish conquest, while severe soil erosion took place during the first years of the colonial period, because of sudden population decimation and sub- sequent abandonment of the farming activities. Ar- chaeological landscape research in the southern portion of the Paitzcuaro basin has identified five anthropogenic soil erosion periods (Fisher et al. 1999; Fisher 2000). 1. A first period of soil erosion is recorded between AD 300 and 775, that follows a long period of landscape stability and high lake stage charac- terized by marshy sediments. Prior to this, no ev- idence of accelerated soil erosion was found, contrary to what is suggested by O'Hara et al. (1993, 1994). Settlements remained small and restricted to islands or lakeshores. Evidence of intensive wetland agriculture was found, includ- ing canal features. Population was scarce. Initial settlement and landscape manipulation caused the most severe disturbance seen in the pre-His- panic record, but degradation was limited in ex- tent, mainly around the settlements. 2. A second period of reduced soil erosion is re- corded between AD 775 and 900. The sediment record indicates lake regression and continued but reduced soil erosion, suggesting rather sta- ble landscape conditions. This is a period of set- tlement expansion on the lakeshores, but popu- lation remained relatively low. 3. A third period of limited soil erosion is recorded between AD 900 and 1325. Settlements greatly expanded along the lakeshores. The sediment record remains similar to that of the previous pe- riod, with a low lake stage. Soil erosion was site- specific rather than landscape-wide, indicating landscape stability. 4. A fourth period of reduced soil erosion is record- ed between AD 1325 and 1520. During these 200 years, settlements were further expanded, form- ing the most intensive pre-Hispanic occupation of the basin and coinciding with the Purh6pecha State consolidation. Nevertheless, colluviation remained low and soil erosion was site-specific rather than landscape-wide, thus suggesting sta- ble landscape conditions. 5. A fifth soil erosion period occurred by the end of the early Hispanic phase (AD 1520-1580). The first 60 years after the Spanish conquest show abrupt changes in landscape conditions. The sediment record reveals landscape-wide collu- viation, the highest in the whole period of anal- ysis, suggesting widespread soil erosion in the Pitzcuaro basin. Accelerated soil erosion coin- cided with a massive population decline, result- ing in agricultural landscape abandonment and triggering land degradation in the whole basin because soil conservation structures were no longer maintained and soil care was neglected. There is consensus that soil erosion accelerated from the end of the 18th century until today (G6mez-Tagle 1994; O'Hara et al. 1994; Enfield 1997, 1998; Enfield and O'Hara 1997, 1999b). Re- cently, land degradation dramatically increased be- cause of (1) large deforestation of the middle and upper parts of the watershed, (2) opening of new agricultural fields on unsuitable soils, (3) inappro- priate use of agro-chemicals, and (4) excessive in- tensification of farming under social and economic pressure (Barrera-Bassols 1987, 1992; Toledo et al. 1992). The current volume of terrestrial sediments entering the lake is estimated at 60-140 Mm3 per year (Chac6n 1993). Nowadays, about 10000 small farmers continue producing maize in the traditional way on 45% of the regional agricultural area, with an average yield of 1.5 t ha-' (Tizcarefio-L6pez et al. 1999). In the local context: the Pichdtaro community territory San Francisco Pichaitaro is located in the southwest of the Pitzcuaro lake basin, in the middle of a com- munity territory which extends between 2000 and 3200 m a.s.1, along a bio-climatic gradient shifting from temperate subhumid to cold humid as eleva- tion increases (T=16-12?C; P=1000-1500 mm).

ZINCK The configuration of the relief is controlled by a set of Plio-Quaternary basalt cones covered by pyro- clasts and separated by small fluvio-volcanic val- leys. Soils include (1) Pachic Melanudands on the summits of the highest volcanoes, (2) Typic Hap- lustands on young volcano slopes, (3) Typic Hap- lustalfs on older volcano slopes, (4) Humic Haplu- stands in the higher valleys, and (5) Typic Haplus- tults in the lower valleys. Haplustands formed from volcanic ash and cinders are supposedly more sus- ceptible to erosion than the other soils, but do not show significant land degradation features, al- though systematic land occupation in this area started as early as 2000 years ago (Schindube 1987). According to archaeological evidence, an important population development took place dur- ing the Classical Period (AD 300-900) and reached a peak during the Post-Classical Period (AD 1200- 1523), with 2000-3000 people living in the sur- roundings, mainly farmers (Gorenstein and Pollard 1983). The presence of fertile volcanic soils and permanent springs at the foot of the volcanoes and lava flows contributed to making Pichditaro an early centre of maize production. Pichaitaro has certainly been affected by envi- ronmental changes after early human occupation took place, since some of the volcanoes have been active until recently according to radiocarbon dat- ing of buried ash layers in valley soils (Barrera- Bassols 2003). Saporito (1975) found 15 tephra layers in lake sediment cores. Radiocarbon dating shows that 10 of these tephra layers were deposited within the last 10000 years, thus throughout the Holocene, and seven of them dated between 3500 and 2500 BP, showing that volcanic activity affect- ed erosion and sedimentation rates in the Pitzcuaro Lake, when the basin was already inhabited. But there are no conspicuous soil erosion features vis- ible on the landscape or recorded in historical doc- uments. A short reference dated 1775 mentions that Pichaitaro had fertile soils and large forest areas (Enfield and O'Hara 1999a). Another source from the 18th century refers to wood extraction and the production of irrigated maize, oranges and wheat in large family plots, together with the traditional milpa system (Toledo and Barrera-Bassols 1984). This strategy of multiple land use continued during the 19th and 20th centuries (West 1947; Toledo 1992). Nowadays, Pichataro is a community of 4500 in- habitants that maintains indigenous structures and traditions, including local socio-political institu- tions, vivid Meso-American cultural elements in daily life, syncretic religious practices, communal land ownership, and multiple land use strategy. About 55% of the land is used for farming, together with some cow and lamb livestock; the rest is cov- ered by pine and oak forest. The indigenous concept of land For indigenous people, land has a symbolic mean- ing based on Mesoamerican beliefs blended with practices from popular Catholicism. In this context, land is perceived as a resource, which behaves as a living being, and as a life support system for hu- mans. Land, plants and humans are bound by re- ciprocal relations, which allow perpetuation of life on earth. Land is venerated as the mother of all liv- ing beings. Cropping and crop harvesting are seen as basic activities securing people's health and sur- vival, and thus require good land care and manage- ment. These ethical values support all local produc- tion activities. However, people consider and ac- cept that this belief system is exposed to and can be altered by economic and environmental uncertain- ties, which means that land's behaviour cannot be totally controlled by people living on it or working it. Thus, humans are bound to land and have to con- jure its benevolence through respect, compromise and tolerance. This is reflected in the relationships between climatic cycle, production cycle and ritual calendar (Fig. 2). The relationships might tran- scend the strict community sphere and take into ac- count externalities, which affect the internal rela- tionships between generations and between indi- viduals, such as temporary out-migrations and off- farm incomes. Therefore, land care, sustainable productivity and conservation are inherent parts of the symbolic land concept. This is then reflected in the way land is managed to meet human needs, without damaging the resource potential and thus the life support system provided by land. In a fash- ion very similar to the modem land concept (FAO 1976; Zonneveld 1995), land is viewed as an inte- gral whole, including water cycle, climate, relief and soils. Water cycle Pichitaro's farmers have acquired from experience good knowledge of the water cycle, because agri- culture is fully rain-dependent, weather is highly variable in space and time, and crops are exposed to unpredictable occurrence of frost and hail (Fig. 3).

Climatic, agricultural and religious calendars. tensity of winds, the moon cycle and the position of Venus are used as meteorological indicators with influence on plants, animals and humans, as in oth- er mountain communities of the region (Motte- Florac 1997). Particular importance is given to the moon cycle, which controls the rhythm of farming activities, forest exploitation, and gathering of fruits and mushrooms (Fig. 4). It is commonly be- lieved that the moon controls the amount, quality and flow of water in the land, plants and animals. It also regulates rainfall and diseases associated with frost and land (Barrera-Bassols 2003). Full moon (Nana kutsi huiniri uiripiti) is considered an appro- priate time to harvest maize and extract wood, which are dry by then. In contrast, planting fruit trees and castrating animals take place during new moon (Sapichu kutsi huiniri), because the body of living organisms is well provided with water at that time. Sowing is discouraged during increasing moon (Andarani shatia) because of excessive moisture, which favours pests and diseases. Climate Farmers distinguish four temperature periods, coupled with three rainfall periods during the year. Special attention is given to periods and meteoro- logical events critical to cropping, such as timing and intensity of the first rains, summer drought, hailstorms, frost and snowfalls, in a fashion simi- lar to the one used by African small-farmers (Ovu- ka and Lindqvist 2000). They also recognize, and take into account for land use planning and farm- ing, three bio-climatic elevation zones, including (1) very cold and very humid, (2) cold and humid, and (3) temperate sub-humid. Local combinations of elevation, aspect and vegetation are used to identify micro-climatic niches and areas prone to environmental risks, including flooding, hail, frost, snow and whirlwind. This practical knowl- edge is embodied in farmers' mental maps repre- senting the micro-climatic fragmentation of the landscape.

Because the territory of the Pichaitaro community lies mainly above 2400 m elevation, the most feared climatic risk is late frost. White frost (lauaka urapiti) on the surface of the soil is less damaging than black frost (lauaka tu- ripiti), which penetrates the soil and affects crop roots. Farmers use a counting system, common among Mesoamerican people, to forecast climatic condi- tions over a full year from the weather conditions in the first 24 days of the month of January in the ongoing year (Katz 1997). The weather observed during the first 12 days of January is used to predict the basic climatic regime of the 12 months of the year, amended in opposite sequence on the basis of the observed weather during the following 12 days. Further improvements are introduced from the direct observation of meteorological phenom- ena, as well as from the behaviour of plants and an- imals. Climatic conditions assessed by farmers co- incide fairly well with the meteorological data re- corded by the station closest to Pichaitaro (Fig. 5). Farmers are used to reacting to small rainfall var- iations during critical periods of the plant devel- opment cycle, using local variations in elevation, topography and aspect, together with soil type and crop variety. Relief Farmers usually segment the relief in 'up' (high), 'intermediate' (middle) and 'down' (low) accord- ing to topographic position. This allows them to recognize the spatial distribution of erosion and sedimentation by water during the rainy season and by wind during the dry season.

Additional attributes are imple- mented to describe the shape of the topography (flat, concave, narrow, etc.) and the degree of dis- section. The relief is described like a toposequence or catena, in its structural and dynamic content, for practical purposes of slope management (Bocco and Pulido 2001). Each relief unit or slope segment is given a local name, which summarizes the envi- ronmental conditions and the farming practices re- quired (Fig. 7). Farmers clearly appreciate the im- provement of soil fertility resulting from influx of volcanic ash during the Paricutin eruption between 1943 and 1952 (West 1947). 236 Geografiska Annaler - 85 A (2003) - 3-4</page><page sequence="9">SUSTAINABLE LAND MANAGEMENT IN MEXICO KIUMlIRHIl JIRIKKUTA'I SOIL MIXED BY IOLE ACTIVITY \MOI.E 11011OS EClHERI KUMUERI KIIARISHI E('HER!

Soil morphological components according to Purh6pecha perception. Soils The word 'echeri', used by Purh6pecha people to designate the soil cover, is in fact polysemic and re- fers at the same time to soil, land, landscape, terrain and bio-climatic zone. Thus local people perceive soil-land as a multidimensional component of the landscape sensu lato. When referring to soil types and properties, the farmer conceives soil as a tri-di- mensional body, similar to the technical concept of soil (Fig. 8). When concerned with farming prac- tices, the farmer uses 'echeri' to designate a bi-di- mensional land surface, with variable management requirements according to local bio-climatic con- ditions. Beyond this practical relationship between farmer and soil-land as a resource, there is a sym- bolic relationship by means of which farmer's land care is rewarded by the land providing him with goods and services, including food, materials for construction and ceramics, as well as medical, rit- ual and magic uses. Local farmers recognize five major soil types: (1) dusty soils (echeri tupuri), (2) clayey soils (echeri charanda), (3) sandy soils (echeri kutzari), (4) gravelly soils (echeri tzacapendini), and (5) hard soapy soils (echeri querekua). Soils are fur- ther subdivided in 15 subtypes and eight varieties on the basis of textural and colour differences in the upper 45 cm (Fig. 9). Additionally, farmers distin- guish composite soils at plot level as textural or col- our intergrades, e.g. dusty-clayey soils (echeri tu- puri-charandani) or dusty black-yellow soils (echeri tupuri turipiti-spambiti). Intergrades are re- lated to their position on the landscape, the adja- cency to neighbouring landscape units, the intensi- ty of sediment transit and the volume of debris ac- cumulation. Land management Management principles Four principles organize the local knowledge on land management: land location, land behaviour, land resilience, and land quality. Land location. Land characteristics and suitability vary according to the position on the landscape. Five main landscape types are recognized, includ- ing summit and shoulder areas, mid-slope posi- tions, footslope positions, valleys, and lava-flow plateaus (Fig. 10 and Table 1). 1. Land in summit areas (teronstakua) and on steep slopes (sanish unanagaristi) is called 'rotting' land because of the decomposed litter covering the soil. Soils are shallow, dark, silty or powdery, loose, always moist and resistant to erosion un- der forest cover.

These soils are called echeri tupuri ter- endani (Pachic Melanudands). The land is good for forest use but not for agriculture. It is neither 'cold' nor 'warm'. 2. Land in mid-slope positions is referred to as hill- breast land (terongarikua). Farmers recognize that soils in backslope areas are exposed to run- off and vary at short distance from shallow and single-layered to deep and multi-layered. The first ones are considered 'cold' and the second ones 'warm'. Together, they are called echeri tu- puri spambiti ka echeri tupuri turipiti-spambiti (Typic and Humic Haplustands). In farmers' opinion, this type of land has low 'strength', dries up very fast, requires special care and long fallow periods, but is nevertheless suitable for agriculture. 3. Land in footslope positions (juatarhujanikutini nirani) is recognized as being heterogeneous be- cause of the strong intermingling of eroded soils and depositional soils. Eroded and washed soils are shallow, yellowish or reddish, dust-clayey, gravelly, hard when dry, sticky when wet, with pumice stones, and drying up fast. Depositional soils are deep, dark, dusty, moist, with good Geografiska Annaler - 85 A (2003) - 3-4 239</page><page sequence="12">N. BARRERA-BASSOLS AND A. ZINCK 'strength' and thus suitable for agricultural uses. The association of eroded and depositional soils is called echeri tupuri spambiti-charapiti ka echeri charanda charapiti (Typic Haplustands and Typic Haplustalfs). Locally, there are dark red soils, very hard when dry, very sticky when wet, and nutrient-depleted; they are called echeri charanda charapiti-turipiti (Typic Hap- lustults). In general, footslope land is considered 'cold'. 4. The valley landscape (tpakua) includes several land types. Soils have formed from alluvial de- posits, are deep and multi-layered, and benefit from permanent influx of nutrients coming from the neighbouring mountain slopes (echeri it- sirhuky or 'juice'). In general, valley soils are fertile. In the upper valley stretches, soils are dark or yellowish dark, and dusty. These soils are called echeri tupuri turipiti terendani (Hum- ic Haplustands). In valley bottoms at lower ele- vation, soils are deep, reddish, clayey and sticky when wet. They are named echeri charanda charapiti (Typic Haplustalfs). In the margin of the valleys, soils are shallow and gravelly. They dry up very fast and, after drying, they become hard and form clods. They are named echeri querekua (Typic Haplustepts). In general, valley soils are considered 'warm'. 5. Soils on lava-flow plateaus (tzacapurhu or jat- sikurini) are shallow, dusty (echeri tupuri) or sandy, with a lot of gravel. A surficial horizon of decomposed oak leaves forms under forest cov- er. Although soils tend to dry up easily, porous pumice stones retain heat and moisture. These soils are called echeri tupuri zacapendini ter- endani (Lithic Humic Haplustands). They are considered 'cold'. Soils on lava cliffs (keren- darhu) are stony, shallow, black or yellowish black (echeri spambiti-turipiti), with a surficial horizon of decomposed oak leaves. They are named echeri zacapendini juskua karihiran (Lithic Humic Haplustands). Land movement and behaviour. Farmers recognize, accept and work with the fact that land is not an im- mutable but a dynamic 'subject'. This concept is re- flected in the expression: 'land moves and behaves' (Fig. 10). Land behaviour changes throughout the year according to seasonal rhythm, climatic varia- bility, rainfall occurrence, and management prac- tices. Similarly, land movement is according to its position on the landscape. The local discourse on land behaviour and movement is similar to that on other biological organisms. Although not explicitly stated, the farmer considers soil as a living organ- ism. Like other living beings, soil-land can be tired, thirsty, hungry, sick or getting old. However, because soil can grow up again, be rejuvenated, re- covered or rehabilitated, it is also considered fun- damentally different from other living organisms, which are ineluctably condemned to perish. The lixiviation of substances through the soil, leading to fertility depletion, and the remotion, transfer and deposition of debris at the terrain sur- face, are perceived as 'normal' processes affecting the land as a living being. The strategy adopted by the farmer to deal with these processes is to benefit from them rather than strictly control them or heav- ily counteract. The word 'erosion' does not exist in Purh6pecha language, although farmers clearly identify the process of remotion and assess its se- verity. Soil erosion is recognized as a natural phe- nomenon, the severity of which might overrun the farmer's control capability, but is not perceived as a negative phenomenon leading to land degrada- tion. It is considered as a periodical process, which depends on land management but is also an integral part of it. Soil debris eroded upslope benefits agri- cultural fields downslope through enrichment in mineral nutrients and organic matter. In this sense, farmers establish a difference between temporary and definitive improvement. Fields on backslopes and footslopes can only be temporarily improved, because overland-flow materials (tsuruani) are in transit and land requires a fallow period to fully re- cover from use. Instead, the constant accumulation of debris (iorhejpiti) on toeslopes and valley bot- toms promotes permanent improvement, which al- lows continuous and intensive land use. Land resilience and restoration. Farmers apply practices on a regular basis to improve land quality, but they may also implement exceptional measures to rehabilitate or restore more depleted soils. The way of compromising with nature, by accepting upslope erosion and taking advantage of downs- lope deposition, is coupled with active sloping land management by means of measures such as sedi- ment trapping, bunds, living fences, deviation of intermittent waterways, terrain levelling and inten- sive manuring. A common practice consists in leav- ing the maize stalks standing on the field after har- vest, as a multiple-effect measure which slows down the remotion of topsoil material, adds organic residues to the soil, and provides fodder to brows- ing livestock, which in return manures the fields. 240 Geografiska Annaler - 85 A (2003) . 3-4</page><page sequence="13">SUSTAINABLE LAND MANAGEMENT IN MEXICO These management practices, carried out through a variety of small local measures, often impercepti- ble at landscape level, are commonly implemented on sloping fields of temporary use to diminish fal- low length. Land quality. Land quality reflects a combination of the former three principles, referring to the land potential and constraints that result from the posi- tion on the landscape, the intensity and periodicity of erosion and deposition of materials, and the management practices applied. Land quality is as- sessed on the basis of a set of criteria, including landscape position, micro-climatic conditions, se- lected soil properties, and soil fertility (soil 'strength'). The concept of 'cold-warm' is fre- quently used to refer to variable combinations of these criteria. For instance, cold soils (echeri tshirdpiti) are on slopes, while warm soils (echeri jorhdpiti) are on valley bottoms. But the same at- tributes of cold and warm may be used in a com- pletely different manner when referring to texture: silty and sandy soils are considered cold, while clayey soils are considered warm, regardless of their topographic position. Fertile soils, enriched by the deposition of mineral and organic debris, are qualified as warm; instead, eroded soils on slopes are qualified as cold. Practically, the antonyms 'warm' and 'cold' are used when assessing the re- quirement for chemical fertilizers, in particular the need for ammonium sulphate - higher in cold soils and lower in warm soils. Integrated land management practices On the basis of these four management principles, farmers recognize three main land classes, prima- rily controlled by landscape position and requiring different land care: land on steep slopes, land on valley bottoms, and land in special conditions. Land on steep slopes: 1. Qualities and limitations: - shallow, simple soils, with only a few layers. - erodible soils. - soils unable to retain moisture, which dry up quickly. - stony or gravelly soils. - weak soils, which get tired quickly. - soils less productive than the average. - soils exposed to sediment transit, which al- lows temporary recuperation during fallow period. - some of these soils require more fallow than work. - north-facing sloping land is prone to frost and therefore risky to cultivate. 2. Care required. - Areas with trees on steep topography are pre- served to counteract erosion and favour litter accumulation to increase soil organic matter. - Plooughing is perpendicular to slope to con- trol and deviate overland flow for crop mois- tening. - After harvest, maize stalks are left standing on the field to counteract wind erosion during the dry season. - Livestock pastures on crop residues and ma- nures fallow land when browsing. - Bunds are constructed at the foot of the cul- tivated fields to retain eroded mineral and or- ganic debris, using stones or planting fruit trees. The latter are particularly recommend- ed because they provide food to birds, badg- ers and squirrels, and prevent them from feed- ing on maize, while at the same time protect- ing crops from wind effect. Land at valley bottoms 1. Qualities and limitations: - Deep soils with several layers. - Loose soils, always moist and enriched with erosion debris coming downhill. - 'Strong' and 'warm' soils. - Soils usually free of stones and gravel. - Soils that do not get quickly 'tired'. - Soils that can produce a lot, depending on care intensity. - Soils exposed to flood, wind, hail and frost. - Soils prone to pests and diseases. 2. Care required. - Crop rotation is practised to compensate for soil deficiencies. - Sowing and planting must be timely to pre- vent crops from being affected by drought or rainstorms. - Fruit trees are planted around the cultivated fields to control wind, hail and pests. - Combination of organic and chemical ferti- lizers is required to compensate for soil fer- tility depletion. Land in special positions. Land that is very site- specific, such as land occurring on rocky ground Geografiska Annaler - 85 A (2003) - 3-4 241</page><page sequence="14">N. BARRERA-BASSOLS AND A. ZINCK (lava flows), in piedmont areas, or in homegardens and backyards, receives special care. 1. Soils on lava flows and in piedmonts. - Soils are stony, simple or composite, and of variable depth. Their strength varies accord- ing to their location and the intensity of sed- iment influx. - Litter accumulating under forest cover coun- teracts soil susceptibility to erosion. - Soils have variable combinations of proper- ties because of their transitional situation. - Soils are too cold and require to be sown using a digging stick, but the heat and moisture of the stones provide strength. Crop adaptability is carefully assessed on individual basis. - Fields are often surrounded by oak trees pro- viding litter to decompose into soil organic matter. - This special land is considered a security land, the use of which depends on the house- hold needs. It is not permanently used be- cause it requires a lot of attention. - Soil production is low but sustained. 2. Soils in homegardens and backyards. - These are the most fertile and deepest soils; they are free of stones and have several layers. - Soils are not ploughed and crops are planted using a hoe. - Soil fertility is maintained only with organic amendments (oak-leaf litter, ash and ma- nure). - Soil care is crop-specific and is done by wom- en. - The cropping system includes perennial, bi- annual and annual species. Discussion The example of San Francisco Pichaitaro demon- strates that traditional agriculture does not neces- sarily lead to land degradation. Farmers clearly un- derstand that land under intensive use is exposed to erosion, structural deterioration and fertility deple- tion, and they are well prepared to identify the causes, assess the severity and apply remedies. Soil erosion is not an issue the farmer deals with when it has become severe enough to make him worried about it. Soil erosion, as well as fertility depletion, is controlled and monitored year-around and year after year to take timely the appropriate corrective measures. Assessment, control and monitoring of land degradation are integral parts of land management to secure sustainable land use. Understanding land degradation and the practical experience to handle it are embodied in the knowl- edge corpus of local farmers. This indigenous knowledge is: - shared by all members of the community, with minor variations according to age, gender and level of experience; - transferred from generation to generation via practical demonstrations, informal conversa- tions and participatory meetings; - explained symbolically and/or logically by rec- ognizing cause-effect relationships; - conceptualized by formalizing practical experi- ence into knowledge rules. Farmers' knowledge body (Corpus) on land degra- dation and sustainable land management is derived from the symbolic meaning attached to land (Kos- mos) and a longstanding farming experience (Prax- is) (Barrera-Bassols and Zinck 2003). Altogether, it represents the social theory of land management the community has developed via centuries of co- evolution. This centuries-old collective knowledge on land management is increasingly exposed to fragmenta- tion as the community undergoes structural chang- es and loses its social cohesion under the impact of internal and external factors. - Between 1976 and 1996, the number of farmers decreased by 62%, as the official maize price dropped, fertilizer and manpower costs in- creased, and governmental subsidy, credit and other assistance programmes were cancelled, af- fecting especially small farmers. This has result- ed in the abandonment of agricultural land, mainly in the less productive and more fragile areas, leading to land degradation. - As a consequence of the former, a significant number of farmers have converted to wood handicraft and furniture production, which has caused a 14% decrease in the forest cover in a short period of time (1986-1992). - Starting in the early 1980s, agriculture was in- tensified in the framework of a green-revolution programme, with massive application of pesti- cides, use of high-yielding maize varieties, and fencing of the agricultural plots to protect them from browsing livestock. This has caused the loss of local maize landraces, although they 242 Geografiska Annaler - 85 A (2003) - 3-4</page><page sequence="15">SUSTAINABLE LAND MANAGEMENT IN MEXICO were well adapted to the topographic and bio- climatic heterogeneity of the community terri- tory, and contributed to the depletion of soil fer- tility following the segregation of agriculture and livestock. - Agricultural diversity continued decreasing in the 1990s with the NAFTA agreement, promot- ing maize imports from the USA and causing the contamination of local varieties with transgenic maize. As a consequence, local farmers had to give up their decision-making autonomy and proven strategies for seed selection, agro-eco- logical management, erosion control and fertil- ity maintenance, among others. - The drastic transformations affecting agricultur- al production have motivated younger people to migrate to regional cities or even to the USA. Nowadays, about 40% of the population lives temporarily outside the community for off-farm incomes. Out-migrations have induced social, economic and cultural changes. - The gradual replacement of the Purh6pecha lan- guage by the Spanish tongue, actively promoted by the government for the sake of cultural inte- gration, has undermined the role of the linguistic vector in the preservation of the local knowledge on land management and its transfer to the younger generation. - All the former has led to weakening the commu- nity institutions, with increasing conflicts be- tween the different sectors of the population and opinion divergences about how to manage the natural resources and control their use. Individ- ual interests start prevailing over collective re- sponsibility and perception. This strongly chal- lenges the sustainability of the traditional ap- proach to land management. Conclusion Starting from the standpoint that local soil-land perception, knowledge and management are essen- tial to successful agricultural improvement or de- velopment, we have conducted ethnoecological re- search in the indigenous community of San Fran- cisco Pichitaro, located in the highlands southwest of lake Paitzcuaro. An integrated research approach was applied, combining a semi-detailed geopedo- logical survey and an ethnographic study with the active participation of local people, including par- ticipatory mapping, transect reading, free listing of soil terms, sorting of soil groupings, problem rank- ing, structuring seasonal calendars, reconstitution of village history, discussion with groups and key- informants, household survey and individual open interviews, according to a method proposed by Barrera-Bassols (2003). Fieldwork activities were carried out during 18 consecutive months (1996- 1998). The research reached the following conclu- sions: (1) human-induced erosion is not an alarm- ing issue at local level; (2) the community as a whole handles a complex soil-land knowledge, in- cluding symbolic, ecological and practical values and attributes; (3) farmers assess land suitability for multiple uses according to the specific climatic, topographic and soil conditions of a variety of local agro-habitats; (4) land fertility decline is perceived and identified through yield decrease and the spread of pests and crop diseases; (5) farmers have adopted and adapted exogenous crops and farming practices via agronomic and cultural hybridization; (6) the symbolic perception of land and the rituals related to the land fertility cycle are fundamental elements of local peoples' cosmovision; (7) farm- ers share a common wisdom about planning the ag- ricultural use of the community territory, which constitutes a social theory on the suitability and management of the soil-land resources; (8) local people have the feeling that official institutions and non-governmental organizations do not address their real problems and needs; (9) the fate and sus- tainability of the community are challenged by the loss of internal cohesion and the impact of exter- nalities; (10) the research framework of this study can be implemented elsewhere to facilitate the di- alogue between the various actors involved in rural development.
