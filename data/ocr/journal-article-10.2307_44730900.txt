ABSTRACT Rollover crash and accident studies identify significant roof-to-ground impacts adjacent to the vehicle occupant as a potential cause of severe injuries. It is not possible with existing dynamic rollover test methods to specifically repeat or recreate a particular roof-to-ground impact in a controlled fashion. Variations associated with tire-to- dolly, tire/wheel-to-ground, and vehicle-to-ground interactions early in current rollover test methods tend to produce unpredictable and unrepeatable roof-to-ground impacts later in the test. A new test device now enables researchers to bypass the uncertainty of these first ground interactions by beginning each test with the desired roof-to-ground impact conditions as a test input. The new rollover test method releases a rotating vehicle onto the ground from the back of a moving semi-trailer. The roll, pitch and yaw angles, translational and vertical velocities, and roll velocity of the vehicle for the first roof-to-ground interaction is repeatable from test to test. However, the subsequent vehicle dynamics are not repeatable as the vehicle rolls to rest. In addition to the onboard and off- board vehicle documentation, unique, close camera coverage is provided from the rear of the trailer. INTRODUCTION Numerous rollover crash tests (1,2,3) and field studies (4,5) have identified potentionally injurious circum- stances, occurring to contained and/or partially ejected occupants, resulting from significant roof-to-ground impacts adjacent to where that occupant is seated. Many rollover test films and data are available that document when dummies experience their most significant loadings, and these loadings can be compared to those known to be injurious to humans. Often these test data also provide information on dummy kinematics, as well as vehicle translational velocity, roll rate, and point of impact with the ground. The problem to date has been that despite understanding the vehicle motions and occupant kinematics likely to cause potentially severe injuries, there has not been a method to replicate those impact conditions through controlled dynamic rollover testing. The test device described here offers a repeatable dynamic rollover methodology that can duplicate a wide range of vehicle-to-ground impact configurations and hopefully advance the analysis of rollover accident occupant protection. Difficulties associated with vehicle rollover testing are well documented in the literature (6,7,8). Various methods have been used to simulate rollover conditions, including pushing vehicles off hillsides (6), attempted dirt tripping (7), curb tripping (9), curved rail and ramp tripping (SAE J857), the Daimler-Benz proposed lateral dolly method (10), which was incorporated into FMVSS 208 (11), and a modified dolly with pneumatic launch pistons (12). A recent paper from Volvo in September 1999 states, "There is a great need for further test method development" to evaluate real life rollover situations (13). The FMVSS 208 dolly is currently the most widely used rollover test device, because it is a reliable method of inducing a lateral rollover, which is the most typical type of rollover observed in the field (14). FMVSS 208 rollover tests have been extensively documented as having large variations in the vehicle rolling motions, despite controlled test conditions. For example, Wilson (6) reported that in four identical rollover tests the 441</page><page sequence="2">vehicles rolled anywhere from 2-1/2 to 3-3/4 times. Orłowski (1) and Bahling (2) tested eight rollcaged and eight production cars, finding results that ranged from two rolls to four rolls. The common conclusion of these and other researchers using the FMVSS 208 dolly method is that it is a useful tool but that it "lacks repeatability," meaning that identical vehicles roll differently from test to test. The significance of this is that, to date, in comparing rollover performance, there has been no way to subject two vehicles to identical rollover impacts. For example, Orłowski (1) showed a vehicle in one FMVSS 208 dolly rollover test rolling hard onto its roof, resulting in massive crush, whereas a second vehicle, with identical roof structure tested under identical conditions, never struck hard on its roof and consequently had only minor roof crush. TEST DEVICE &amp; METHODOLOGY The new rollover test device suspends a rotating vehicle above the ground in a drop fixture mounted on the back of a moving semi-trailer. The test consists of dropping the spinning vehicle onto its roof from the desired height, at the prescribed yaw, pitch, and roll angles, and at the desired roll rate and translational velocity. After the dropped vehicle lands on its roof, it is allowed to continue to roll to its point of rest. The system can be configured to provide either translation and drop or can be configured to provide translation, rotation and drop of the test vehicle. The system is also compatible with industry-standard instrumentation packages for both vehicle and anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs). Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the fixture configured in two test modes. Figure 1 shows a test vehicle in the translation and drop mode without rotation. Figure 2 shows a test vehicle configured for translation, rotation, and drop. The rotating system supports a test vehicle on bearings at its front and rear ends. It will accommodate vehicles ranging in size from a Ford Aspire subcompact car to a Ford Econoline multi-passenger van. The vehicle is suspended from the rear of the semi-trailer at a defined pitch angle, yaw angle, and drop height prior to the test. The fixture accommodates pitch angles of 0 to +/-15 degrees and yaw angles of 0 to +/-15 degrees for all vehicle sizes. The suspended vehicle rolls about the pivots at the desired angular velocity, propelled by a 5-hp motor. The mass and stiffness of the trailer system are tuned to minimize jounce or roll oscillations that could affect the accuracy and repeatability of the impact. The test is conducted by driving the tractor at a specified speed (translational velocity measured with a trailer- mounted fifth wheel), with the test vehicle prepositioned at the prescribed pitch angle, yaw angle, and drop height, and rotating at the pre-drop roll velocity. With the tractor stopped, the vehicle roll velocity is brought up to the specified impact rotational velocity (at any roll rate up to one revolution per second). The tractor is then gradually accelerated to the desired translational velocity, and the vehicle is released just prior to reaching the targeted landing zone. The distance the vehicle travels as it drops is taken into account in the timing of the release. Knowledge of the drop height and roll velocity allows a precise determination of the roll angle at the roof-to-ground impact. The controlled rotational drive system accommodates vehicle roll rates of up to one revolution per second and can be controlled to within +1-2 deg/sec. A repeatable drop of the vehicle requires precisely synchronized release of the two ends of the vehicle. The rollover fixture utilizes exploding bolts to achieve a synchronized release. The ATDs are held in position by harnesses until the translational and roll velocities are attained. The pre-drop ATD position is monitored remotely, in real-time, with an onboard video camera to insure correct dummy position prior to drop. Once the vehicle velocities are stabilized prior to the test, the harness is pneumatically released so that the ATD is restrained only by the vehicle restraints during the test. Figure 1. Test vehicle and fixture configured for translation and drop. Figure 2. Test vehicle and fixture configured for translation, roll rate and drop. 442</page><page sequence="3">Because the precise location of the roof-to-ground impact is defined prior to each test, cameras can be positioned to capture details that are not normally available in other rollover test methods. Close-up, high- speed, exterior views of dummy motion and the first roof- to-ground impact are recorded through the use of fixture- mounted cameras positioned horizontally and vertically to capture the event at initial ground impact. As illustrated in Figure 3, high-speed cameras are suspended from the rear of the drop fixture. Figures 4 and 5 illustrate the views from these fixture-mounted cameras, which clearly show the vehicle and dummy positions at impact. Onboard cameras capture close-up views of ATD interactions inside the vehicle. Figure 3. Four fixture-mounted cameras. Figure 4. View at roof-to-ground impact from fixture- mounted camera during a test. Figure 5. Fixture-mounted camera showing roof impacting reference grid on asphalt during a test. Tests may be conducted on any surface (asphalt, dirt, sod, ice, etc.) that the tractor/trailer can traverse. However, the surface cannot have large irregularities that initiate jounce or roll of the trailer. DYNAMIC BALANCING DEVICE Prior to the rollover crash test it is necessary to dynamically balance the test vehicle. Figures 6 and 7 illustrate the laboratory mounted balancing fixture. Due to the roll rate capability of the rollover test device, it is essential that the test vehicle not only be statically balanced, but also dynamically balanced. In order to generate repeatable and predictable impact angles, the vehicle must be released and dropped without precession. This requirement is achieved by aligning the principal roll axis of the vehicle with the axis of rotation. Locating the correct positions to mount the roll pins is difficult due to the wide variety of vehicles and possible test configurations. This is done prior to mounting the vehicle to the trailer using the balancing fixture where roll pin bearing loads are recorded and analyzed. Adjustable axles are mounted to the front and rear of the vehicle and are supported by bearings. Precise adjustment of the roll axis is accomplished on the stationary dynamic balancing fixture. Balance adjustments are made by moving the axles on slider bars that are attached at both ends of the vehicle; the slider bars also allow angular alignment of the axles. All components needed during the drop stage of the test must be mounted to the vehicle prior to dynamically balancing the system. Depending on the vehicle suspension design, it may be necessary to restrict suspension travel during run-up. The test vehicle is then spun at specific vehicle pitch and yaw angles to determine the correct attitude required for balancing the particular system. During the drop stage of the test, part 443</page><page sequence="4">of the axle adjustment system is not released with the vehicle. To ensure the released vehicle, not the entire system, is dynamically balanced, counterweights are added to the adjuster components that are not dropped with the vehicle. Figure 6. Balancing fixture with axle alignment and pitched vehicle. Once the vehicle is dynamically balanced, it can be spun at any roll velocity up to one revolution per second. ATD motion and position during this fixture-mounted rotation can be studied using onboard video cameras. The kinematics of belted occupants in rollover collisions have been studied through static hang tests, inverted vertical drops (17), and with rotating seat inversion fixtures to simulate the airborne phase of a rollover (18,19). The effect of seat belt geometry and tension on the head excursion of human volunteers, a Hybrid III ATD and a cadaver using a rotating fixture, which swung through approximately 270 degrees, was explored by Moffatt, E.A., et. al. (19). The new laboratory based rotating fixture illustrated in Figure 7 provides a new tool to study occupant kinematics during a rollover. The advantage of rotating a full vehicle as compared to a simulated seat and belt fixture is that it provides more realistic restraint and interactions with the vehicle interior. Further, because this new fixture can be rotated continuously it can better simulate the progressive movement of an ATD through multiple rolls for the study of head excursion. Figure 7. Balanced vehicle ready to be transferred to the drop fixture. DEVELOPMENTAL TEST RESULTS The developmental testing program investigated tractor/trailer speed, drop location and repeatability, onboard and off-board camera placement, and controllability of yaw, pitch, and roll angles and roll velocity at ground impact. Five developmental tests were conducted to establish the following performance parameters. The tractor/ trailer translational speed can be controlled to within 1 km/h. Vertical oscillations of the drop fixture are no larger than +/-25 mm. The roll velocity on the spin axles is controlled to +1-2 deg/sec, and does not change significantly when the vehicle is dropped. Assuming a typical 0.3 meter drop height at a roll rate of 360 deg/sec and considering the variations associated with trailer oscillations and the pre-drop roll velocity, the expected variation in roll angle at ground impact is +1-4 degrees and the greatest deviation in the vertical impact velocity is 0.3 km/h. The pitch and yaw are less sensitive to these variations. The placement of the high-speed cameras, with ground reference, provided detailed coverage of the roof-to- ground impact, which is very difficult in current dynamic rollover testing. Because the precise location of the roof- to-ground impact was defined prior to each test, cameras could be positioned to capture details that are not normally available in conventional rollover testing. The photo sequence illustrated in Figure 8 depicts the vehicle during the first roof-to-ground impact, as captured by one of the fixture-mounted high-speed cameras. Cameras mounted onboard the test vehicle capture close-up views of ATD kinematics. 444</page><page sequence="5">Figure 8. Sequence illustrating vehicle impact from a fixture-mounted camera. Figure 9. Sequence of motion in the drop-zone grid starting at roof-to-ground contact. RESULTS FROM A SPECIFIC TEST A test was conducted on a rollcaged passenger car with a Hybrid III driver position ATD restrained with the production lap and shoulder belt. The goal of the test was for the driver side roof to impact the ground at a roll angle of 190 degrees, a translational velocity of 24.6 km/h, a vertical drop height of 0.46 meter and a roll rate of 360 deg/sec. Figure 9 contains a sequence of photographs illustrating the drop of the vehicle and its subsequent rolling motion. The vehicle rolled two times before coming to rest on its roof. 445</page><page sequence="6">The success of the test is determined by the accuracy of the vehicle orientation and velocities at the first roof-to- ground impact. The translational velocity was 25.3 km/h while the target was 24.6 km/h. There was no significant vertical motion to the drop trailer. Therefore, the drop height of 0.46 meter was achieved. The roll velocity of the test vehicle at drop was 361 .8 deg/sec (target 360 deg/sec). Figure 10 illustrates the roll angle at touch down. The roll angle at impact was measured photographically using the fixture-mounted camera. A reference was placed across the top of the windshield and compared to the grid placed in the predetermined drop zone. The roll angle of the vehicle at initial roof-to-ground impact was 190.6 degrees (target 190 degrees). Figure 10. Fixture-mounted camera view of the drop- zone grid and the vehicle reference lines. The pitch and yaw were preset at -5 degrees and 0 degrees, respectively, when the vehicle was positioned on the drop fixture. The vehicle was released at those angles with no significant change as the exploding bolts fired within 3.5 ms of each other. The ATD assumed the desired position with the head inside the roof rail. The pneumatically controlled restraining straps were released once the vehicle was rotating at the desired roll rate, prior to dropping the vehicle. The onboard camera documented the dummy position. DISCUSSION The ability to conduct repeated dynamic rollover tests with the same initial roof-to-ground impacts provides opportunities for analysis that were not previously possible without running a significant number of tests. Detailed high-speed film sequences from cameras that are moving with the fixture provide close-up views with ground reference that are not possible in other rollover test methods. These cameras not only capture the initial impact, but also continue to provide useful details of the vehicle motion, particularly if the semi-trailer is decelerated at approximately the same speed as the rolling vehicle. A tight ground-based photo grid located at the first roof-to-ground impact provides a scale for photographic analysis. The predictability of the first roof-to-ground impact also provides unique opportunities for instrumentation placement that are not practical with traditional rollover test methods. Typically, with FMVSS 208 dolly rollovers, it is difficult to predict which part of the roof will strike the ground. Often instrumentation at specific vehicle locations is out of position because the location of the roof-to-ground impact is unpredictable. With this new fixture, opportunities for roof rail accelerometers, pressure sensitive foils, and roof displacement measuring devices can provide an enhanced understanding of roof/dummy/ground interaction. Improved scientific investigation of the performance of rollover safety devices is facilitated by the various features and repeatable nature of this test method. Because rotating a vehicle at one revolution per second about its center of gravity is a reasonable simulation of a typical airborne phase of a rollover (2), the fixture serves as a useful test device, even without the use of its translational motion and drop features. The occupant containment and excursion characteristics attributable to various injury countermeasures, such as seat belts and side air bags, can be explored without ground impact. However, since potential safety devices such as side window nets, air curtains, or ejection resistant glazing can be subjected to direct impacts, their crash performance can be further analyzed by incorporating the translation and drop/impact features. In contrast to a stationary inverted drop test, this method replicates the time duration involved in a roof-to-ground impact that occurs in a dynamic rollover. The contribution of vehicle structure and geometry to occupant injury can also be investigated with the fixture. The effects of roof strength on roof crush and safety in realistic rollover conditions can be further analyzed because comparable vehicles with and without added roof strength, i.e. installed roll cages, can now be subjected to repeatable, realistic rollover roof-to-ground impacts. For example, field data shows a seemingly contradictory finding that added roof strength does not necessarily result in less roof crush in actual rollovers (15). It has been suggested that it is not roof strength, but rather the duration of the roof-to-ground impact that dictates the amount of crush (16). Continued research with this fixture will lead to a better understanding of the effects of roof strength and roof-to-ground contact duration on roof crush and rollover injury mechanics. 446</page><page sequence="7">FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS Replicating the dynamics of a single, repeatable, impact during a rollover event, without additional rollover test damage, will also be possible with this test fixture. If the rolling vehicle can be caught or have its rolling on the ground arrested after the first impact, then subsequent damage can be minimized. Preliminary tests have shown that single roof impacts can be accomplished with static outriggers mounted to the undercarriage of the test vehicle that prevent vehicle roll after the first event. These outriggers may be modified so they deploy after the first roof-to-ground impact, thereby allowing the vehicle to roll while attached to the test fixture. CONCLUSION This new rollover test device offers a reliable method to impact the roof of a rolling vehicle into the ground at specific vehicle orientations and velocities, which can be controlled to simulate realistic rollover impacts. The first impact is repeatable from test to test, although the motion of the vehicle after the first impact is not repeatable. Unique, close photographic coverage is facilitated by cameras mounted on the moving drop fixture located meters from the first roof-to-ground impact.
