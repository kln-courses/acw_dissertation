<plain_text><page sequence="1">PETER M. DALY AND MARY V. SILCOX William Marshall's Emblems (1650) Rediscovered E 11 -Ą _ 11 -Ą nglish emblems consist of a small group in comparison with the more extensive production of vernacular emblems on the Conti- nent. But they are more numerous and significant than many students of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century English literature and culture realize. This is because the only book-length study and bibliography of English emblems, by Rosemary Freeman,1 and the recently pub- lished An Index of Icons in English Emblem Books 1300-1700 (Norman, Okla., 1986) by Huston Diehl underestimate both the number and importance of books of emblems and impresas in English. According to our estimates, which are being continually revised upwards, at least 55 books appeared in over 130 editions by 1700. New editions and even new emblem books are being discovered and reported regularly. The latest addition in this process of rediscovery is the subject of this brief essay. The set of six emblems reproduced here is, as far as we know, unique and hitherto unknown. It was discovered in the Folger Shake- speare Library at the end of a collection of emblems bound together and simply entitled Emblems [ca. 1650 ].2 The collection is described by the library as "Various emblems, some numbered, some pasted in, without title-page, pagination, and signatures. Title taken from the back of binding. Smedley copy." The volume has a nineteenth- century binding with the label "Ex libris W. T. Smedley" and is a collection of emblem engravings from at least two different sources. The first group of engravings in this collection consists of 41 em- blems - each containing a pietura and a Latin single-line subscriptio - and five allegorical figures. They are presented one per page, recto only, except for five sets of two per page. The names of four of the I. Rosemary Freeman, English Emblem Books (1948; rpt. London, 1967). 2.

Silcox 347 five figures were added by hand in ink - Moderatio, Voluntas, Hu- militas, and Amor. We tentatively identify the remaining figure as Religio. These plates appear to constitute a sequence, and each bears a number that was evidently intended as a page number, not an emblem number.3 Some leaves are missing, and many are bound out of nu- merical sequence.4 The subjects are varied and include moral state- ments, religious themes, and Catholic subjects. Our chief concern is with the final group of engravings bound in this volume, the six Marshall emblems. Unlike the preceding plates, these have been pasted in and are not numbered.5 It is obviously a set of emblem engravings. Each has the same circular shape and scrolled border at the top and bottom containing a Latin motto, an English epigram, quotations, and references, usually biblical. The English quotations are from the Geneva Bible. The information "I:P: Inven- tor" and "W: Marshall Sculp &amp; Excudit. 1650" appears at the bottom of the first emblem page. There are no references to these emblems in the standard reference works either on emblems (e.g., Mario Praz, Studies in Seventeenth-Century Imagery , or Freeman) or on English engraving (e.g., Hind; see note 7). They are apparently unknown. We have identified them as the "Six Emblems, W. Marshal Sculpt." which were included in the 1662 broadside advertisement published by the printseller Peter Stent, and by his successor John Overton. In his recent book on Stent, Alexander Globe lists this set as unlocated.6 No biographical information is available on William Marshall; not even the dates of his birth and death are known. His work appeared between around 1617 and around 1650. He was a busy engraver, turning out portraits as well as book illustrations and series of prints such as "The foure Complexions," and "The Four Elements."7 Mar- 3. Plate 66 has two emblems but only one number. It is preceded by a leaf numbered 65 and followed by a leaf numbered 67. 4. The order of their appearance is as follows: 42-43, $0, 62-67, 7I-73&gt; 46-47, 51, 54~59, 38?, 35-40, 23-24, 27-32, 22, 33 (Moderatio), 48 (Voluntas), 82 (Humilitas), 60 [Religio?], 68 (Amor). Possibly the nineteenth-century collector reorganized the plates according to his own thematic interests, bringing together the group of allegorical figures at the end. None of the plates is signed. 5. Someone has inscribed a square in pencil to frame each circular engraving, and then cut around the square to produce the emblem for pasting into the volume. 6.

As for the "inventor" I. P., we have so far not been able to identify him unequivocally. The initials I. P. were used by the engraver John Payne, appearing, for example, on the engravings he did for The Hierarchie of the Blessed Angelis. It is certainly possible that I. P. was John Payne. He and Marshall worked together on at least one occa- sion, and both worked extensively with the publisher Peter Stent. Marshall is also known to have copied Payne's engraved portraits at least twice.8 Payne died, however, around 1640, ten years before the date on Emblem One. Furthermore, evidence leads Corbett and Nor- ton to conclude that he was not trained in free drawing: his skill lay in copying other artists' work.9 If I. P. is Payne, it is unlikely that either he or Marshall, both strictly engravers, wrote the verses for these emblems, but there is no indication of the author's identity. Since the printseller Peter Stent advertised the set as Marshall's, we have retained the ascription. All we can know of the author comes from the emblems themselves, and we must assume that he is responsible for both the references and the verse. He was an educated man, with an easy knowledge of the classics, the Bible, theological writings, and current debates, and imaginative enough to adapt these materials to his own uses. His verse is competent if unassuming. And, finally, he was a royalist and probably an Anglican. Before reproducing and discussing the individual emblem engrav- ings, it might be useful to present some general findings. As far as the physical structure is concerned, Marshall employed a circular form, which was unusual in native English emblems. The only other exam- ple is Wither 's collection of 1635, which in any case utilized Rollen- hagen's plates. 10 The absence of letter-press is noteworthy, suggesting 8.

Silcox 349 but not proving that Marshall's collection was perhaps not intended for publication in book form but as a set of engravings.11 In terms of emblem structure, these emblems employ the charac- teristically tripartite structure. At the top of the page stands a Latin motto, written slightly larger to highlight its importance; this is followed immediately by the epigram, which is divided into two parts and written in the scroll above and below the pietura. The representational and interpretational functions of the epigram are clearly divided, with the lines above the pietura being descriptive and the section beneath interpretative. Quotations and references, usually biblical, complete the emblem at the bottom (except for Emblem Two, in which the quotation follows the motto). The subjects or themes of the emblems are moral, religious, and covertly political. We have no way of knowing precisely when the verses were writ- ten nor the pieturae designed. The tone of the emblems on political themes seems to point to a completion after Charles' surrender in 1646 and prior to the full consolidation of Cromwell's power at the end of 1648 and the execution of Charles I on January 30, 1649, but this dating must remain in the realm of speculation. Circumstantial evi- dence does suggest that the publication of the set was delayed. Al- though the first plate is dated 1650, the set appeared neither in Stent's first general advertisement of his stock, a broadside which appeared in 1653, nor in any of the smaller catalogues (1658, 1659, 1660) printed before its appearance in the 1662 broadside. Other works by Marshall do appear, however, in the 1653 advertisement. The political implica- tions of Emblems Three, Five, and Six, discussed below, may well explain this omission. These emblems can be read as criticism of the Puritans and of the violent overthrow of the monarchy by Parliament and Cromwell. Peter Stent was clearly sensitive to these political changes. He altered his printer's sign from the crown to the apolitical white horse around 1646-1650. Alexander Globe concludes that "the absence of the sign of the Crown on prints published after 1646 shows Stent's hesitancy to appear a Royalist in a city whose sympathies were increasingly Parliamentarian."12 Given the political criticism in Mar- shall's emblems, it is understandable that the publisher might delay their publication until 1662, that is, after the Restoration. 1 1 . There were English emblem books made up of engraved pictures and engraved texts - e.g., Philip Ayres' Emblemata Amatoria (1683) - but they belong to the later seventeenth century. Cf. Wenceslaus Hollar's Emblemata Nova, which also has no letterpress. 12. Globe, Appendix B, p. 189.</page><page sequence="5">3 5° English Literary Renaissance We shall first reproduce and describe each plate before attempting an interpretation. Since the level of reduction required for reproduc- tion makes it difficult to read some of the texts, we provide these in printed form. Translations of all Latin texts are supplied. Emblem One Motto Diu fluctuans tandem mergitur. [Tossed up and down for a long time, he is at length drowned.] Picture A wide, wave-tossed river, opening into the sea in the distance, with a bank on either side. The left bank has farm buildings and cattle on it. A fishing boat is inrthe distance. In the foreground, a boat has cap- sized, and an oar, a hat, and a swimming man are being swept downstream. The man is saying, "Eheu quam ripam" [Alas, which shore?]. Epigram He swims ith' stream but swims more in his braine Doubting of two shores whither He should gaine Thus of his Landing unresolv'd He thinks Till tyme and breath be spent &amp; then he sinks Such is his state but that his Danger's more Whose Faith's to choose when Death knock's at his Dore Quotation How long halt yow betweene two opinions if the Lord be God etc. i Kings 18.21. In reading the picture in conjunction with the epigram it becomes evident that the central motif of this emblem is the shipwrecked traveler who does not know which shore to make for. Unable to resolve the dilemma, he drowns. The image of the shipwrecked traveler is, of course, a frequent metaphor for the imperiled soul tossed on the sea of life. This emblem is open to two interpretations - the choice the drowning man has to make could be between faith and</page><page sequence="6">Peter M. Daly and Mary V. Silcox 351 Emblem 1 disbelief or between rival churches. The latter interpretation recom- mends itself when we consider the pressures of the religious squabbles of the time, the phrasing of "Whose Faith's to choose," and the religious biases revealed in the rest of the emblems. If one reads the interplay of the entire emblem - motto, picture, epigram, and quotation - more closely, however, the former inter- pretation seems more likely. Looking only at the picture and the first two lines of the epigram, one focuses simply on the man's choice between the two shores - possibly two churches. But the conclusion to the descriptive section of the epigram and even more the inter- pretative section reveal that the important choice between the two shores - one inviting and the other barren - is driven by urgency. To delay that decision is, as the motto declares, to guarantee death. The S 0/ V1* ^ ï" refold '¿J</page><page sequence="7">352 English Literary Renaissance emphasis is no longer on choosing the correct shore, but on acting before it is too late and one's strength is gone. The quotation from I Kings 1 8 provides the context for interpreting both the choice and its urgency. In I Kings 18, Elijah persuades the Israelites to worship the Lord rather than Baal - to choose faith in the one true God over a false god. In these terms the emblem joins in the seventeenth-century de- bate concerning the efficacy of deathbed repentance and conversion. Throughout the Elizabethan age books on how to die well were produced, "but it is in the first half of the seventeenth century that the significance of the lesson impressed itself upon public consciousness and made itself heard in sermon and book with some of the vigor of two hundred years before."13 This renewed awareness, as Mary Catharine O'Connor points out, was a result of the prevalence of the plague in the seventeenth century, as it was in the fifteenth century. "A list of the most Vendible' books of 1658 includes many on death."14 These seventeenth-century tracts, essays, meditations, and sermons emphasize the need to prepare for dying and go into great detail on how to die well, one's final Christian duty. Without going into the intricacies of the argument, we can gen- eralize by saying that the strict Roman Catholic position, represented by Robert Parsons' The First Booke of the Christian Exercise (adapted for Protestant readers by Edmund Bunny and commonly known as Bunny's Resolution) was that last-minute repentance and therefore choice of faith over despair was ineffectual. Because of the Calvinistic doctrines of predestination and salvation by faith alone, Puritans could embrace the concept of deathbed salvation, but in reality their position seems to have differed little from that of Anglican writers, who admit the possibility of deathbed repentance and salvation but consider it extremely unlikely. The position of the majority of writers of all persuasions in the first half of the seventeenth century is that repentance is the gift of God and cannot be undertaken whenever one pleases, particularly when one's will and mind are weakened by the approach of death. Last-minute repentance, they feel, comes not from the true faith of turning to God but from despair at the fear of death, and it is therefore invalid.15 13.

See O Connor, pp. 19211., for some of the seventeenth-century books on death.</page><page sequence="8">Peter M. Dały and Mary V. Silcox 353 According to Jeremy Taylors two-part sermon "The Invalidity of a Late, or Death-bed Repentance, " the salvation of a man who waits until the last minute to repent is "little lesse then absolutely impossi- ble, " and all he can do is "pray, and groan, and call to God, and resolve to live well when he is dying; but this is but just as the Nobles of Xerxes, when in a storm they were to lighten the ship to preserve their Kings life, they . . . leaped into the sea: so (I fear) do these men, pray and mourn, and worship and so leap overboard into an ocean of eternal and intolerable calamity."16 Or, as this emblem puts it, the man who waits until Death is at his door to affirm his faith is in far greater danger than a drowning man. Emblem Two Motto Aliis Deus sibi bellua. [To others a god, to himself a beast.] Picture The interior of a church or temple with six square columns support- ing a central dome with a railed skylight. Under the dome in the center stands a bull with the inscription "apis egipt" [Apis Aegip- tiorum]. On the left is a tonsured monk or priest, with bent knee and hands folded in prayer. Beside the monk and lying before the bull are a papal tiara and a crozier. Epigram Their Bull's their God in their Preists custodye Turne him but loose, hee'l shew Bulls chastity. He whom the world calls God as free, from evill Oft proov's him selfe a Man a Beast a Devili. 16. Jeremy Taylor, XXVIII Sermons Preached at Golden Grove (1651), pp. 65 and 79. In books created for the sick to read while they actually were dying the writers do emphasize the rare possibility of success. During the last quarter of the seventeenth and the eighteenth centuries the position on deathbed repentance was softened; see Robert G. Walker's "Rochester and the Issue of Deathbed Repentance in Restoration and Eighteenth-Century England," South Atlantic Review, 47 (1982), 21-37.</page><page sequence="9">354 English Literary Renaissance Emblem 2 References Apim Bovem adoratis et pascitis et paulo post de viro in Deorum albo scripto.

Daly and Mary V. Silcox 355 a monk, papal tiara, and crozier pictured within a church of Italianate design makes it clear that Catholicism is the false religion.17 The picture is stridently anti-Catholic and anti-papal, and in this respect reminiscent of Thomas Jenner 's emblems. A monk is shown revering a bull, thereby imputing idolatry to the Roman church. The picture inscription and quotation allude to Apis, the sacred bull of Memphis that was worshiped by the ancient Egyptians as the incarnation of Osiris, a fertility god. The representative bull was chosen with great care by the priests of the cult and honored as divine. The quotation deserves special attention. It is unusual for this set in that it is not from the Bible. It is identified by the emblematist as deriving from the eighth book of Arnobius' Adversus gentes or Ad- versus nationes [The Case Against the Pagans ], an attack on contempo- rary pagan cults during the reign of Diocletian around A.D. 300. Ar- nobius himself does discuss the worship of Apis, but this quotation is actually an adaptation from the Octavius of Minucius Felix (xxviii. 8- xxix.4), which was appended to Arnobius' work and was thought to be its eighth book.18 The quotation from Minucius Felix extends the criticism of the Roman church beyond what is depicted in the emblem. As it appears in the Octavius, the quotation attacks the religious practices of the Egyptians. Here, however, those references have been removed in or- der to apply the criticism to the Catholics. They then become by im- plication the pagans, choosing to worship a creature which is even less than human (the Pope), and killing victims for him (i.e., persecuting Protestants). Even the criticism of the "Bulls chastity" in the epigram is an echo from the section of Minucius enclosed by the quotation, in which the pagans are accused of using shameful sexual practices as sacred rites. The sexual immorality of the papacy and Catholic priests in general was a common target for anti-Catholic writers. 17. Alexander Globe has kindly pointed out that the Italian architectural design of the church in this emblem would have been unknown in England in 1650 except through illustrations of one kind or another. He notes that Payne often worked from Continental designs, but this does not necessarily mean the entire emblem was copied from a Continental source. What it does mean is that such a design, rather than that familiar from English churches, would be associated with Continental Catholicism. 18. For a translation of Arnobius' The Case Against the Pagans see George E. McCracken's two- volume annotated edition (Westminster, Md., 1949). There are two translations of the Octavius. The Loeb translation appears in a volume with Tertullian and is translated by Gerald H. Rendali (London, 193 1). A more recent translation is The Octavius of Marcus Minucius Felix, translated and annotated by G. W. Clarke (New York, 1974).</page><page sequence="11">356 English Literary Renaissance The epigram is an attack both on the Pope and on Roman Catho- lics' alleged superstitious reverence for and near deification of the Pope ("he whom the world calls God"). To Catholics he is infallible ("free from evil"), whereas in fact he is only a man at best and a devil at worst ("a Man a Beast a Devili").19 The anti-Catholic sentiment of this emblem, dating from around 1650, must be seen both in the context of Stent's publication program and as a reflection of the changing currents in religious and political affairs in seventeenth-century England. Stent's publications often "graphically reinforced or criticized the religious and moral values of his day. Plates of the Ten Commandments, biblical figures, and re- ligious views of death or meditation inculcated Protestant beliefs directly, while Roman Catholics were ruthlessly satirized."20 Anti-Catholic propaganda came in waves in response both to reli- gious concerns and political developments. No single event seems to have elicited this particular emblem, but from the evidence of both secondary and primary sources,21 it is clear that anti-Catholic feeling was running high in the 1640s in response to circumstances such as the pro-Spanish policy which Charles I continued after James I's death, the favor shown to papists by Charles I's wife Henrietta Maria, the failure of the early Stuarts to support Continental Protestanism, the massacre of Protestants during the Irish rebellion (1641), the sus- pected popery of high churchmen such as Archbishop Laud (executed 1645), and the general apprehensiveness during the Civil War. It still remains to be seen to what extent emblem books, and emblematically embellished broadsides and tracts, reflect the cycle of propaganda. But there is no doubt that beginning with Andrew Willett in the 1590S, through Thomas Jenner 's stridently anti-papal emblems of the 19. Papal infallibility was formally declared a dogma of the church only at the Vatican Council in 1870. It was, however, a teaching of the church for centuries before that, defended for example by Cardinal Bellarmine at the beginning of the seventeenth century and criticized by Protestant polemicists. The teaching was so widely accepted that even a popular pamphleteer such as William Prynne attacks Roman Catholics for their belief in the Pope's infallibility in his A pleasant purge, for a Roman Catholike, to evacuate his evill humours (1642): "On the Popes Non erring whilst he sits in Peters Chaire," "On the Popes not Erring," "On the Popes not sinning and Erring as Popes, but as Men," "On the Popes not Erring, and on falling from Grace" (p. 74). John Manning has pointed out to us that even a moderate clergyman such as Jeremy Taylor criticized the notion of papal infallibility in The Liberty of Prophesying (1647), p. 125. 20. Globe, pp. 2-3. 21. For example, William Prynne's pamphlets Hidden workes ofdarkenes brought to publike light (164$) and A pleasant purge, for a Roman Catholike, to evacuate his evill humours (1642).</page><page sequence="12">Peter M.

Emblem Three Motto Elati ad ignominiam suam. [They have been exalted to their own dishonor. ] Picture An astronomer holding a cross-staff looks at a night sky with a sextant. Several stars shine, as well as a comet. Epigram A blazing Starr's no Starre but to our thinking His matter's from the earth base slime and stinking His rise is suddaine suddaine is his ending His Luster is the fire of him-selfe spending Alt[h]o me think's since thow art made a Starr Thy folly's more advanc'd more noted are Who list to know may take thy elevation And finde th'art nought but blazing exhalation Pride and Ignorance make thy fortunes sadder The one bids thee clime t'other turns the Ladder References To Fooles dishonour tho they be exalted. Prov.3.35. This emblem focuses on the comet or "blazing star" as the phe- nomenon was known at the time. At one level, the comet signifies the moral criticism of misplaced self-importance, perhaps of prideful advancement. Pride and Ignorance control the ladder on which the</page><page sequence="13">358 English Literary Renaissance Emblem 3 foolish man advances only to be brought low when the ladder turns, a variation on the wheel of fortune, which could be political or moral in its application. This emblem can also be read as a not so veiled commentary on the political situation at the time of the Civil War. This political interpretation depends upon an understanding of the place of comets in Renaissance theories of the geocentric universe. The traditional view, centuries old and supported by the authority of Aristotle, Plutarch, Seneca, Ptolemy, and a host of other philoso- phers, was that comets were dry, dense exhalations from the earth rising to the upper air and refined by the action of "superiors" or the influence of heavenly bodies. Since the heavens were the place of the fixed stars, and changes should not or rather could not take place</page><page sequence="14">Peter M. Daly and Mary V. Silcox 359 there, comets had to be sublunar, terrestrial rather than celestial, and classed with other phenomena of the upper atmosphere. Their blazing light is produced through their own destruction as they are con- sumed. Since they "signifie corruption of the ayre"22 they are natu- rally signs of pestilence, bloodshed, and upheaval of every kind, particularly the fall of kings and great men.23 This emblem applies both the contemporary interest in astronomi- cal phenomena such as comets and the traditional interpretation of comets to create a royalist, conservative image of the rise of Crom- well to power. Engaged since 1642 in a war against his own Parlia- ment, by 1646 King Charles had been forced to surrender his power and had been imprisoned, to be executed in 1649. In the place of royal rule by divine right had come rule by commoners, chief among whom was Cromwell, whose comet-like rise was - in the eyes of royalists and many Anglicans - expected to be short-lived. The new star in England's firmament was, unlike the divinely appointed king, a commoner "from the earth," and like the comet he is composed of "base slime and stinking." As the motto suggests, Cromwell is "ele- vated to his own dishonour," and like the comet's, his "Luster" is merely the "fire of him-selfe spending" in a position unsuited to him. By the standards of the scientific community in 1650, the view of comets which underpins this emblem was definitely conservative. The entire geocentric structure, including this view of comets, did not satisfy everyone, and from the comet of 1577 onward astron- omers such as Tycho Brahe were arguing vociferously over the nature of comets and the universe in general. However, artists, writers, and ordinary people were reluctant to give up the Ptolemaic universe with its familiar and rich symbolism, and seventeenth-century literature is full of examples of its continued evocative powers. Fittingly, this traditional astronomical doctrine is used to attack those who would change the traditional pattern of social and political life. All three were linked in Renaissance thought and all three were threatened in the mid-seventeenth century. 22. Leonard Digges, Prognostication Euerlastinge, 2nd ed. (1576), fol. 6. 23.

The nucleus of this emblem is the story of the Spartan boy and the fox as told by Plutarch in his Lives (Ly sargus) and his Mor alia (Ap- ophthegmata Laconica 234A-B:35): When the time had arrived during which it was the custom for the free boys to steal whatever they could, and it was a disgrace not to escape being found out, when the boys with him had stolen a young fox alive, and given it to him to keep, and those who had lost the fox came in search for it, the boy happened to have slipped the fox under his garment. The beast, however, became savage and ate through his side to the vitals; but the boy did not</page><page sequence="16">Peter M. Daly and Mary V. Silcox 361 Emblem 4 move or cry out, so as to avoid being exposed, and later, when they had departed, the boys saw what had happened, and blamed him, saying that it would have been better to let the fox be seen than to hide it even unto death; but the boy said, "Not so, but better to die without yielding to the pain than through being detected because of weakness of spirit to gain a life to be lived in disgrace."24 To the ancients the story taught stoicism and self-discipline, but it apparently did not find favor among Christian thinkers and educa- tors. Although Sparta and Plutarch's Lives and Mor alia were admired by the Renaissance, especially for their ideas on education and ancient virtues, Elizabeth Rawson in her study of the Spartan tradition can 24.

ConTcienti* &amp;ctą the - tnncjiji ~</page><page sequence="17">362 English Literary Renaissance provide no examples of the use of this particular story during the Middle Ages or the Renaissance. Spartan ideas on exercise and priva- tion were recommended, but theft could hardly be reconciled with Christian virtue or social responsibility.25 The story is not found in medieval bestiaries, and Kenneth Varty 's book on the fox in the Middle Ages does not mention this legend.26 Renaissance writers did not ignore other Spartan tales from Plutarch, and some were even adapted to emblem books, such as Corrozeťs emblem on the mother who kills her cowardly son (Hecatomgraphie , 1540), or the story of Lycurgus training the two dogs (Van Veen's Emblemata Horatiana, 1607). As far as we have been able to ascertain, this emblem is the only adaptation of this particular Spartan legend between Plutarch and the eighteenth century.27 In Marshall's emblem the moral of the story of the boy and the fox has been completely reversed from its significance for the ancients. The concealment of the fox is no longer an admirable act, since the fox is now a symbol of the guilty conscience that will eat away at the sinner even while he hides his crime. The issue is moral and spiritual. He who perseveres in his crime, hidden though it may be from the world, will end in "perdition," whereas confession will bring mercy. Sixteenth-century Puritan writers such as William Turner used the image of the fox, together with that of the wolf, to describe their religious opponents. The wolf represented an openly committed member of the Roman Catholic Church, while the fox was a secret Roman Catholic hiding within the Church of England (for example, in Turner's The Hunting of the Romish Wolf[c a. 1554]). Anthea Hume states that this "image of the 'Foxe' was evidently now a serviceable part of the vocabulary of Elizabethan Puritans . . . , a distinctly Pu- ritan idiom."28 Literary examples appear in the July and September 25.

Certainly the hidden nature of the fox is similarly exploited; in each case the situation is most dangerous because the fox's presence is not acknowl- edged. But whether the earlier tradition directly influenced this em- blem is not known, nor is there any indication within the emblem that we are to interpret the hidden conscience as cloaking secret Romish leanings in an individual or in the Church of England.

Pro v. 20.3. Emblem Five embodies a conservative moral and political com- ment that is both general and precise in its application. A solar eclipse had a meaning beyond that of a natural phenomenon. Not only was it a sign of catastrophe; it was regarded in hierarchical and moral terms as the interference of the moon, the "lesser Planet made to rule the night" with the rule of a greater heavenly body, the sun. This "Usurp- ing" of power also has the effect of blackening out the light of the moon and the earth itself, which "Is at a loss in blacke obscuritye." The motto enunciates the positive, if conservative, maxim: "Let ' mcâdUnJ * » oĄ 'Z ^&lt;5^- times</page><page sequence="20">Peter M. Daly and Mary V Silcox 365 anyone shine, but in his own sphere," indicating that excellence is possible in each and every social stratum, role, or function. But the sphere is ordained, and the epigram condemns movement beyond that sphere as presumption. He who "presumes to shine beyond his Spheare" is a "disturber," and this "meddling with their betters" can prove a "disgrace" or end in a prison sentence ("Jayle and Fetters"). But toward whom is this warning directed? To what extent is this a social, or a political comment? With the marriage of new wealth and old aristocracy a frequent occurrence, and with the rise of an in- creasingly powerful merchant and professional class already well ad- vanced at the time, this emblem is either hopelessly out of date, or more likely, has an application that Peter Stent's middle class clients would understand and approve of. Indeed, the prison sentence with which the "disturber" is threatened is a rather heavy punishment for such social climbing. A political interpretation seems much more credible. The quotations from Aquinas and the Bible strengthen the sym- bolic associations of the eclipse to the point where one must seriously doubt whether the emblem is merely a general social comment about men keeping to their proper stations. That from Aquinas is a para- phrase from Summa Theologica, Part I, question 117, article 4: "Motor inferioris caeli non posset movere caelum superius" [the mover of the lower heaven cannot move the higher heaven].30 Angels not only belonged to a strict order of nine ascending ranks, but were also associated with the hierarchically arranged planets. Angels had influ- ence, but it was limited; they enjoyed no upward mobility. The association of angels in their spheres with the sun; the interpretation of the moon and eclipse as presumption, disturbance, and meddling; and the telling metaphor of usurpation, all suggest a theme of political power rather than social hierarchy. The biblical quotation corroborates the political nature of the em- blem even further. The entire text of Proverbs 20.3 reads, "It is an honour for a man to cease from strife: but every fool will be med- dling." This sounds like good royalist advice during a revolution, but the verse preceding it is even more directly related to contemporary events: "The fear of a king is as the roaring of a lion: whoso provoketh 30.

It is perhaps significant of the emblematist's attempt to keep his criticism in the realm of allusion and image that he quoted 20.3 rather than 20.2. The mere choice of the image of the sun lends credence to a political interpretation for this emblem. It is so strongly associated with the ruler in a hierarchical society that to use it to represent a lesser station would in itself be a kind of usurpation. The image of the king as sun is of course very familiar and powerful in such works of English Renais- sance literature as Shakespeare's Richard II. An example contempo- rary with Marshall's engravings is found in Richard Lovelace's "To Lucasta From Prison, an Epode," written during the Civil War. Love- lace not only refers to the King as the sun, but even uses the image of the solar eclipse to describe Parliament's usurpation of Charles' power: He [the King] who, being the whole ball Of day on earth, lends it to all; When seeking to eclipse his right, Blinded, we stand in our own light. The image, complete with solar eclipse, also appears in, the Eikon Basilike, purportedly Charles' own meditations on the last few trou- bled years of his reign. Marshall engraved the emblematic frontispiece for this widely read book, which was first published just after the King's execution in 1649: For, although I can be content to Eclypse My owne beames, to satisfie their feares; who think they must needs be scorched or blinded, if I should shine in the full lustre of Kingly Power, wherewith God and the Lawes have invested Me: yet I will never consent to put out the Sun of Soveraignty to all Posterity, and succeeding Kings. . . . Happily where men have tried the horrours and malignant influence which will certainly follow My enforced darknesse and Eclypse, (occasioned by the interposition and shadow of that body, which as the Moone receiveth its chiefest light from Me) they will at length more esteeme and welcome the restored glory and blessing of the Suns light, (ch. 10) The details of the image in Eikon Basilike and this emblem are strik- ingly similar.31 3 1 . The image seems to have been in widespread use for the description of Charles and his usurpation. A poem ascribed to John Cleveland, "The General Eclipse," develops the image of royalty as the sun and the Civil War as an eclipse ( The Poems of John Cleveland, ed.

Silcox 367 The image of the solar eclipse in Lovelaces poem, Charles' medita- tion, and Marshall's emblem holds out the hope that the eclipse will pass and the sun shine as before. The royal prerogative is tied to the natural order, and its usurpation to the eclipse as a portent of catastro- phe. As in Emblem Three, the social and political order is seen as de- riving from the same source as the natural. Cromwell had "usurped" the rule of the King, the sun of the nation's world, and that eclipse would last until the death of Cromwell in 1658 and the restoration of the monarchy in 1660. However, in 1650, when the engravings were executed, it would have been unwise, even dangerous, to criticize openly those who had usurped the monarch's power and were in control of Parliament and country.

The emblem roundly condemns the practice of usury which "breaks a good mans backe." The biblical quotation reinforces the belief that usury is unjust and shameful. Together with inflation, usury was one of the most vexing socioeconomic problems of Renais- sance England, as it was on the Continent. A great number of tracts were written and sermons were preached on the subject, and it was discussed by Parliament. Elizabethan and Jacobean literature is almost unanimous in condemning usury and usurers.32 The religious pro- hibition in Deuteronomy 23.20-21 was open to interpretation, the more conservative (and this included most Anglican divines) reading it as a prohibition against any charging of interest, while Calvin argued that a low interest was permissible. To us, now, the debate may seem simply quibbling over an abstruse religious point, but it was far more than that. The whole question was intimately tied to commercial development and the growing position of those who traded in money, often associated with Puritans. The usurer was regarded as "at once parasitic upon the traditional structure of a well- ordered commonwealth and indifferent to its social obligations."33 By 1650 most people seriously involved in the debate had agreed that some interest was necessary, and the question then became how much and how it should be regulated. According to Celeste Turner Wright, however, neither popular writings nor the literature of 1540-1640 reflect the changing attitudes of economic and legal circles toward the taking of interest: "The enormous changes in business life and in economic thought made no perceptible dent in this stubborn tradi- tional doctrine" that usury was not only wrong, but enormously dangerous to the social and moral structure.34 This emblem, like the previous political emblems, reveals the con- servative bias of its author.

The pietura and motto in particular criticize not just the effect of the usurer's actions on an individual, but the shift in attitude which set the accumulation of private wealth above the good of the community, an attitude that characterizes the capitalist spirit. Mar- shall's emblem is perhaps representative of the later stages of the debate in that it voices an ethical concern rather than a religious objection to the threat posed by commercial individualism to the commonweal.35 Although we have as yet found no other examples linking the owl with usurers in the literature of the usury controversy,36 this emblem does so by gathering together several strands of folklore and imagery concerning the owl. Being night hunters, owls were often considered to be evil birds or ill omens, especially if seen during the day. Small birds, such as those depicted in the emblem, apparently attack owls if they venture out in daylight. This piece of natural history was not only documented by writers such as Pliny (x. 19) and Conrad Gesner (De Avium Natura, 1 585, p. 622), but was a common motif in medieval carvings and paintings. In Centuries of Owls in Art and the Written Word (Norwalk, Conn., 1967), Faith Medlin reproduces pictures and lists carvings of this motif extant in a number of English churches. Fowl- ers, having observed this behavior, employed owls as decoys to bring small birds into reach. The De Lisle or Arundel Psalter (ca. 13 10, English) illustrates such a scene.37 Both the attacks and the use as a decoy are referred to in the Middle English The Owl and the Night- ingale (11. 1625-69), 38 and the owl's role as a decoy appears in Rollen- hagen's emblem, 1,51 (Wither, II, 1). Furthermore, since the owl prefers darkness to daylight, its major moral significance in the besti- aries was as a symbol of the Jews who rejected Christ.39 The owl 35. Tawney, p. 171. 36. John Blaxton has a chapter (5) in his The English Usurer (1634) which collects "similitudes to which usurers, and usury are resembled," although the image of the birds that Marshall uses is not included. Wright also reviews the common images associated with usurers (in "The Usurer's Sins"), and the owl is not among them. 37.

Kathryn Hume claims that "the Jew/sinner simile relating to the Owl . . . was very widely known."40 Marshall's Emblem Six draws on these traditions, as well as on the folklore tradition pairing the owl with its antagonist or in this case victim, the nightingale.41 Although the owl is not identified as a Jew in the emblem, the association of Jews with usurers was very strong, and adds a resonance to the scene and the hatred.42 The use of medi- eval owl lore seems to be another instance of this emblematisťs harkening back to older values; in most seventeenth-century litera- ture featuring anthropomorphic owls, the owl has already become the wise bird more familiar to modern readers - for example, in Michael Drayton's very popular The Owle (1604), William Goddard's Owles Araygnement (161 6), and Thomas Dekker's The Owles Almanacke (1618). This emblem is quite possibly an attack on the Puritans. In his article "Shylock the Puritan," Paul N. Siegel argues that Shakespeare was "depending on his audience to associate Judaism, Puritanism and usury."43 Jews were not at the time a threat to English society, having been expelled years earlier and not legally readmitted until 1664, but Shylock the Jewish usurer possesses the characteristics criticized in literature as belonging to the Puritans: hypocrisy, intolerance, self- righteousness, and miserliness. That same complicity is to be found in this emblem through the image of the owl and its associations with Jews and thus with usurers. Usurers in England were not Jews, and the usurer was strongly associated with the Puritan as early as Thomas Wilson's Discourse Upon Usury (1572), in which the reader is warned against the "dissemblinge gospeller" who "useth covertelie all deceypte that maye bee, and for pryvate gayne undoeth the com- mon welfare of man. And touching thys sinne of usurie, none doe more openly offende in thys behalfe than do these counterfeite pro- fessours of thys pure religion" (p. 178).

Hypocritical Puritans are accused of cruel usury in Ben Jonson's The Alchemist (III. ii. 72-73): they "take the start of bonds broke but one day, / And say they were forfeited by Providence." And in 1641 John Harris repeats the same accusation: Puritans "are men which respect their profits above their consciences, . . . make try all of their love, and then in verity you shall find them inwardly Jewes, though outwardly Saints" ( The Pu- ritans Impuritie, p. 5). Once again, the emblematist's metaphoric crit- icism of the opponents of the royalists may well have proved too dan- gerous by the 1650s for Stent to risk selling the engravings openly. These emblems are interesting from several perspectives. Because of the relatively late arrival of the form in England and the practical problems of reproducing pictures in England, most English emblem books derive from Continental sources. Even on the Continent the same images were constantly reused and adapted by succeeding em- blematists. It is possible that sources may be found for Marshall's picturae , but so far the images, themes, and subjects of these emblems appear to be unusually original. With the recent recognition of literary texts as systems of signs has come a new ability to appreciate emblems, built on a similar, if much older recognition. Emblems benefit in a number of ways from the new theoretical emphases. An understanding of context, for example, is essential for emblems; and emblems, in particular those we have been looking at, strongly depend on the reader to interact and create meaning. Much work that is now being done has led critics to see texts as socially and politically generated and contingent in their meaning. Emblems benefit greatly from such ways of regarding literature, because the language and conceptual patterns of synchronicity - puns, dislocation, structural disjunction, metaphysical imagery - are the patterns of emblem literature. Marshall's emblems participate in the life, both political and social, of their time. They articulate the clash of ideologies surrounding the author in the seventeenth century. In the case of these emblems, the hidden, witty, puzzling nature of the emblem genre is a perfect disguise for the author's occasion- ally dangerous political and social commentary. Or perhaps it was thought to be sufficient disguise to produce the emblems until Crom-</page><page sequence="28">Peter M. Daly and Mary V. Silcox 373 well's forces took over completely. Given the dangerous political situation, it is no wonder these emblems were perhaps censored and not openly advertised for sale until after the restoration of the mon- archy. These emblems reflect the issues of their time and the concerns of the middle-class clientele that patronized Stent's print shop: "Like all publishers, Stent catered to a specific clientele - not the handful of connoisseurs or the intelligentsia whose interests form the usual sub- ject of academic art history, but the rising urban lower and middle classes. ... In this milieu, the publisher called the tune, hoping to cover his costs and even make a profit by attracting a large number of purchasers."44 They exhibit a populist conservatism aimed at such a clientele. They also serve as a reminder, if one is necessary, that it was not just the upper classes who supported the King and the established order, but also the middle classes, who were often conservative and traditional in their views. Marshall himself was employed by the royalists for a number of years (although not exclusively) and associ- ated with Quarles and his circle, staunch royalists.45 Most importantly, perhaps, these engravings reflect the evolution of the emblem genre. They could not be mistaken for earlier work because of their tone and their topicality. This emblematist makes sophisticated use of the emblem's allusive and symbolic possibilities to create satire and to comment on the politics and controversies of the moment. Since the prints are so topical, they and the publishing history we have postulated for them mirror the shifting contempo- rary concerns during the Civil War and early Restoration. As Alex- ander Globe has observed: "Stent's advertisements suggest a new approach to studying the prints, not as engravings to be evaluated strictly from an aesthetic perspective, but as documents of social history reflecting the spirit in which the prints were originally con- ceived."46 This observation applies with particular force to Marshall's six emblems. Rather than giving generalized advice on mores and morals as the earlier emblem books tend to do, Marshall's emblems, 44. Globe, p. 3.
