<plain_text><page sequence="1">A response to David Cockburn ANN LONG In his paper 'Human Beings and Giant Squids', recently published in Philosophy,' David Cockburn raises two issues which prompt me to respond to him. He raises the first by using interchangeably two concepts which I would argue are in no way interchangeable. He raises the second by quoting Jane Goodall on the behaviour of some young chimps after the death of their mother, but failing to draw attention to what I would regard as by far the most interesting aspect of the description she gives. First, the two concepts. On occasions too numerous to detail but a few, Cockburn uses 'pain' and 'suffering' as if they were interchangeable, when surely they are not even commensurate. He suggests that Singer argues for an animal's capacity to suffer by asking not 'can it suffer?' but 'can it feel pain?' (p. 135; again p. 136), and offers no challenge to such an illegitimate slither from the one idea to the other. He writes of 'ascribing pain' and 'relieving suffering' (p. 138) as if the ascription and the relief were of one and the same thing. He writes of dogs 'capable of suffering' and 'a dog in pain' (p. 138) again as if the one translated unproblematically into the other. But pain and suffering are surely very different. Cockburn himself refers to pain as 'a state of consciousness'. But isn't suffering, by con- trast, a state of self-consciousness? Don't we need to be able to attri- bute meaning to pain in order to be said to suffer from it? Surely there are meanings that human beings can give to their pain which result in them not suffering from it but positively rejoicing in it; as there are meanings that human beings can give to their painlessness which result in them not rejoicing in it but positively suffering from it? Pain research is a notoriously difficult area, and all the major theo- ries-pattern theory2; gate control theory3, specificity theory4 are rec- ognized as deficient, not least by their proponents.

But at least in this latter area, research has produced some consensus. Of the many factors shown to influence pain tolerance-degree of injury, culture, personality type, for examples-all illustrate the importance of subjective perception. On degree of injury, for just one small example, Beecher5 compared American soldiers injured in battle with civilians recovering from major surgery. Controlling for shock, trauma-induced analgesia and levels of tissue damage, he found that 80% of the civilians requested morphine as com- pared with 33% of the soldiers. His suggestion was that the mean- ing attributed to the pain ensured that it would be experienced dif- ferently by the two groups. Put simply, soldiers were saying 'hooray, I'm alive', feeling positive, 'rejoicing'; civilians were say- ing 'hell, I'll maybe die', feeling negative, 'suffering'. At an anec- dotal level, this is, for example, about the different reports of dif- ferent women in childbirth. At a philosophical level, it is crucially about how we should use the concept 'suffering'. Suffering is not consciousness of pain-witness the fairly every- day fact that humans can be conscious of pain and not suffer: can suffer when not in pain-but consciousness of a self, and not nec- essarily even one's own self, experiencing that which is in some way grievous. Brecht shows us a Galileo, for example, avoiding the pain of torture by recanting what he knew to be true only to expe- rience instead the suffering which is self-contempt. And to use, if only metaphorically, perhaps the most potent pain and suffering imagery of all: on the cross, Jesus' pain was one thing; his suffer- ing quite another. And had he let that 'cup' be taken from him, had he 'saved' himself his pain, then to the suffering because of what others could do would have been added the infinitely worse suffering because of what he had done himself. I would suggest that all this means that in philosophical debate-as of course elsewhere-it is inappropriate because mis- leading to blur the distinction between pain and suffering. And that with the possible exception of the higher apes, especially chimps, where self-consciousness seems to begin to glimmer,6 suf- fering, being a 'self' phenomenon, is basically a human phenome- non. And so second, those chimps. 5 H. K. Beecher, Measurement of subjective responses: quantitative effects of drugs (Oxford University Press 1959) 6 G. G.

On 1 October 1972 The Sunday Times printed her obituary. She was an adult female chimp at Gombe National Park, Tanzania, and Jane Goodall had been studying her for 11 years. The obituary, perhaps the only one ever written for a non-human animal, stressed first her contribution to science. But then, know- ing perhaps the likely anthropomorphism of its readership, it changed tack: It is true that her life was worthwhile because it enriched human understanding. But even if no one had studied the chimpanzees at Gombe, Flo's life, rich and full of vigour and love, would still have had a meaning and a significance in the pattern of things. A meaning and a significance in the pattern of things? A life full of love? When Flo died, her young male offspring Flint seemed to grieve, just as Pom, Prof and especially Pax seemed to grieve for Passion. He avoided social contact, stopped eating, sat hunched and rocking for many hours a day. Within a week he too was dead. As we human beings read about Flo and Passion, about Flint, Pom, Prof and Pax, we are 'moved'-to use Cockburn's word. We see another at-least-incipient self apparently suffering, and we are 'moved'. But what of other chimps? What of Pom and Prof for Pax? What of any other chimp for Flint? In all that 'suffering', no fellow chimp offered consolation. No chimp has ever been report- ed to have consoled another. If they do have mental states, and grieve at the loss of significant others, they do not seem to recog- nize the same mental states in their fellows. The answer to the question 'can I see another's woe, and not be in sorrow too?' would seem to be 'no' for humans, but 'yes' for chimps. And the reason? Perhaps because for chimps the 'I' of 'can I see?' is inappropriate. With no 'I' there is no self-consciousness, therefore no 'other' or 'thou' consciousness, therefore no recogni- tion of, because no experience of, 'suffering'.
