<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Michelle Scalise Sugiyama University of Oregon From Theory to Practice: Foundations of An Evolutionary  Literary Curriculum The Need for a Prehistory of Literature A pivotal moment in my graduate career occurred when a colleague confided that he  saw literary study as the study of human behavior, and all study of human behavior  as the study of human biology. Thus, he continued, literary study ought properly  to be a sub‐field of the biological sciences (Constable, personal communication).  From this view, English programs would be housed in Biology Departments — as  would programs in Psychology, Anthropology, Linguistics, History, Economics,  Political Science, and so on. To date, of course, this has not happened and is  unlikely to do so. But what if literary study was taught as the study of human  behavior? What if English Departments were suddenly faced with the prospect of  designing an emphasis or program in biology‐based literary study? What would  such a curriculum look like? Anyone who teaches specific literary texts or authors  from an evolutionary perspective must eventually confront these questions because,  even for a one‐semester course, he/she must determine what students need to know  in order to understand and apply this approach. Moreover, evolutionary literary  scholars must show students why it is useful to examine storytelling in broad,  biological perspective: they must demonstrate what this critical approach offers  that others do not.  One major advantage of evolution‐based literary study is that it enables us to  frame out the prehistory of literature and the cognitive architecture that scaffolds  narrative. This, in turn, lends great insight into the possible functions of storytelling.  Reconstructing the conditions under which storytelling first emerged enables us to  generate hypotheses regarding the role(s) it played in ancestral human environments,  as well as those it plays in modern life. Identifying the cognitive structures involved  in narrative processing enables us to generate hypotheses regarding the selection  pressures that led (directly or indirectly) to its emergence. These are not trivial  questions. The study of literature is required at all levels of education, from grammar  school to college, presumably because such study has been deemed important  Style: Volume 46, Nos. 3 &amp; 4, Fall/Winter 2012 317 </page> <page sequence="2"> 318 Michelle Scalise Sugiyama or useful by persons endowed with the authority to make such judgments. Thus,  literary scholars ought to be able to provide an intelligible, sensible answer to the  question: Why is the study of literature important? Understanding why humans tell  stories is critical to answering this question. In turn, understanding the ecological  and cognitive wellsprings of literature is critical to understanding why humans  tell stories.  A comprehensive view of the conditions under which storytelling emerged  demands an understanding of our species’ ecological niche, known as the foraging  niche. This in turn requires a basic understanding of evolutionary theory, hominid  evolution, hunter‐gatherer studies, and human life history. A comprehensive view  of the cognitive structures that scaffold storytelling behavior demands a basic  understanding of the evolved design of the human mind, which requires forays into  the realms of developmental psychology, cognitive psychology, and comparative  ethology. Incorporating this material into a literature class with room to spare for  reading and discussion of literary texts is a daunting task. Yet a working familiarity  with this research is critical to understanding specific periods, genres, authors, and/ or texts from an evolutionary perspective. One possible solution to this problem is to cover this material in an introductory  course, as a prerequisite to more advanced evolution‐based literature courses. English  departments often offer a general‐education, introductory‐level literature course  of some sort, intended to present an overview of the subject matter and its first  principles. Such courses provide ready‐made vehicles for teaching the fundamentals  of evolutionary literary study. For example, the UCSB English Department used  to offer a course called The Art of Narrative, which the instructor was entrusted to  teach as he or she saw fit. In 2006, I decided to design my own introductory literature  course at the University of Oregon, entitled Origins of Literature. This course covers  concepts, theory, and research critical to a biology‐based understanding of what  literature is, how the mind generates it, and how humans use it. As such, it offers  a means of giving students a comprehensive grounding in the theory and research  upon which evolutionary literary study is based.  Origins of Literature also fills a major gap in the discipline. Whereas the study  of art history typically begins with an examination of the earliest human aesthetic  artifacts and their generative context (e.g. the cave paintings and female statuettes of  Upper Paleolithic Europe), literary study does not. Yet, as with painting and sculpture,  understanding when humans began telling stories is critical to understanding why  humans tell stories. Advances in evolutionary biology, psychology, neuroscience,  paleo‐anthropology, and linguistics are steadily increasing our depth of field with  </page> <page sequence="3"> Foundations of An Evolutionary Literary Curriculum 319 regard to the human literary past. It is no longer necessary or acceptable for a  student of literature to be unfamiliar with literary prehistory. The remainder of this essay summarizes the content and organization of Origins  of Literature, and explains the rationale for the topics it covers. This aim of this  exercise is twofold: (1) to prompt a conversational gear shift among evolutionary  literary scholars from the question of why to the question of how to teach literature  from an evolutionary perspective; and (2) to demonstrate the value of including  literary prehistory in programs of literary study. If this essay sparks a dialogue among  evolutionary literary scholars regarding how to incorporate evolutionary psychology  and anthropology into the teaching of literary texts, it will have served its purpose. First Principles An introductory literature course ought to answer at least three questions:  (1) What is literature?  (2) Why should we study it?  (3) How should we study it? The questions must be addressed in this order, because one can’t argue that it  is important to study x or make claims about how best to study x without first  establishing what x is. Biology is the study of living organisms, anthropology is  the study of humankind, psychology is the study of the mind, literature is the study  of  . . . what? I’ve never taken an English class that addressed this question (and  with a BA, MA, and PhD in English, that’s saying something). No wonder so many  students find literary study confusing and unsatisfying: they are not told from the  outset what this field of study seeks to explain. The task of definition has special  import for advocates of biology‐based literary study, as the scientific method demands  first and foremost that one observe and describe the phenomenon being studied.  Accordingly, Origins of Literature begins by defining literature. Although,  broadly construed, the term literature encompasses all verbal art forms, the bulk  of literary output is narrative in structure. The critical components of narrative —  character, action, sequence, setting, conflict, resolution — suggest that narrative is  a means of representing or simulating human experience — that is, human minds,  behaviors, and goals, and the set of constraints in which these unfold (Scalise  Sugiyama, “Reverse‐Engineering”). Thus, narrative is a representational format  — a means of organizing, storing, and retrieving experiential information in the  mind. In contrast, storytelling is a behavior, which involves the transmission of  narratives among humans. These definitions beg the overarching question of the  course: what, if any, is the benefit of exchanging simulations of human experience?  </page> <page sequence="4"> 320 Michelle Scalise Sugiyama This brings us to the question of why we should bother to study literature.  When properly equipped with a working definition of the subject, students can  answer this question themselves. They see how pervasive storytelling is in human  life. They see that narrative and storytelling are common to humans across all  cultures. In short, they see that storytelling is a distinguishing characteristic of  our species that cries out for explanation. The answer is clear: we should study  literature because understanding why humans tell stories and what they tell stories  about helps us understand what it means to be human. And that, ultimately, is the  goal of the humanities.  At this point, the answer to the third question — how to study literature —  becomes self‐evident. Narrative originates in the mind, and storytelling originated  in a specific ecological context. Thus, if we want to learn why humans exchange  simulations of experience and why this behavior is so compelling and pervasive,  we need to understand the design of the mind along with the conditions that  produced it. This requires a basic understanding of the ecological niche to which  our species is adapted and the cognitive capacities that scaffold our successful  occupation of it. The first part of Origins of Literature is largely dedicated to this  task — to delineating the set of conditions, constraints and capacities that made  the emergence of storytelling possible.  Origins of Literature A comprehensive course on the origins of literature ought to address the what,  where, when, why and how of this behavior. The most logical place to begin is the  “what,” which involves defining the behavior in question (see above), as well as  identifying and describing patterns in this behavior (see below). We are left with  the following topics: the approximate age of this behavior (“when”); the social and  ecological conditions under which it emerged (“where”); the psychological capacities  requisite to its production (“how”); and a causal explanation of its occurrence  (“why”). The following is an overview of the main topics covered in Origins of  Literature and their contribution to a holistic understanding of the foundations of  narrative and storytelling. The Antiquity of Storytelling. Delineating the conditions under which storytelling  emerged requires that we first determine when storytelling emerged. Those of us  who love literature may share Joyce Carol Oates’ gut feeling that “storytelling is  as old as mankind, at least as old as spoken language” (8), but this claim merely  poses further questions: what is “mankind” and how old is it? How old is spoken  language and how do we know that storytelling emerged with language rather than  before or after it? The field of literary study seems content to accept the antiquity of  </page> <page sequence="5"> Foundations of An Evolutionary Literary Curriculum 321 storytelling as a probable but unverifiable truth that is therefore not worth examining.  Instead, scholars interested in “ancient” literature concentrate on the earliest written  texts. This is a mistake on two counts. Firstly, the antiquity of storytelling can be  estimated and bears examination. Various lines of evidence suggest that storytelling  emerged tens of thousands of years ago — at a point in time when all humans still  lived as hunter‐gatherers (Scalise Sugiyama, “Food”). Although contemporary  and historically documented foraging peoples are not a facsimile of our hunter‐ gatherer ancestors (Kelly), the social and ecological conditions under which they  conduct their lives are similar in key respects to those that obtained in ancestral  environments: they depend largely on foraging for their subsistence, live in small  natural‐fertility populations, and lack motorized transport, telecommunication,  and western medicine (Marlowe). Thus, studies of contemporary foragers enable  us to reconstruct the conditions under which storytelling first emerged. Secondly,  the fact that storytelling emerged in a hunting‐and‐gathering context tells us that  storytelling emerged in a world without writing. In other words, literature emerged  as an oral art form. Thus, to begin the study of literature with the earliest written  texts is to begin in medias res — that is, from a possibly faulty set of assumptions  about precipitating events and conditions and, hence, about the nature of the matter  before us. The Context of Storytelling. Once the antiquity of storytelling has been  established, the next step is to acquaint students with our species’ ecological niche.  A species’ niche is the way it makes its living; thus, an ecological niche is a set of  adaptive problems, and a species is a set of adaptations dedicated to addressing  those problems. Our species’ niche is the foraging niche, which is characterized by  the exploitation of nutrient‐dense resources (e.g. meat, tubers, nuts, seeds) using  complex extraction techniques. The term complex extraction techniques includes  but is not limited to the use of tools and tactics to obtain food: it encompasses all  technologies and strategies used to manipulate the physical and social aspects of  the human environment. Manipulation of the physical environment includes such  diverse activities as medicinal use of plants, weapon manufacture, and controlled  burning. Manipulation of the social environment also comprises a wide range of  behaviors, including cooperation, mate acquisition, and child rearing. The use  of complex extraction techniques demands a wide range of skill and knowledge  sets, including: distribution and seasonal availability of resources across a broad  geographic range; tool, fire, and shelter construction; wayfinding; avoidance of/ defense against animate and inanimate hazards; social norms; health care; and  childcare. In a foraging context these include (but are not limited to): distribution  </page> <page sequence="6"> 322 Michelle Scalise Sugiyama and seasonal availability of resources across a broad geographic range; tool, fire,  and shelter construction; wayfinding; avoidance of/defense against animate and  inanimate hazards; social norms; health care; and childcare. We turn next to life history theory, which examines the timing of major life  events, such as the length of a species’ lifespan and the point in the lifespan at  which it begins to reproduce. Human life history reflects the skill and knowledge  demands imposed by entry into the foraging niche. Compared with other animals,  humans are characterized by (1) large brain size relative to body size and (2) an  extended period of post‐weaning juvenile dependence and delayed reproduction  (a.k.a. childhood), which is supported by (3) parental and allo‐parental provisioning  of juveniles. This is a risky life history strategy, because the longer an individual  postpones reproduction, the greater the odds it will die before reproducing. Thus, the  benefit of delaying reproduction must outweigh this risk. The same logic applies to  our disproportionately large brains: brain tissue is energetically expensive to grow  and maintain; thus, the benefit of growing a large brain must outweigh the cost.  The driving force behind these developments is the foraging niche itself. The use  of complex extraction techniques is skill‐ and knowledge‐intensive. Acquisition  of these skill and knowledge sets demands advanced cognitive capacities, which  in turn demand extensive neural infrastructure — in effect, a larger brain. Thus,  occupation of the foraging niche requires a long developmental period for brain  growth and skill/knowledge acquisition.  As noted above, one of the complex extraction techniques humans use is  cooperation, defined as the often tacit agreement between two individuals to provide  mutual support. Individuals typically maintain several exchange relationships,  creating a support network that can be called upon for a variety of needs. In  foraging societies, support often takes the form of food sharing, which is used to  buffer day‐to‐day variance in individual foraging returns: if I come home empty‐ handed, I can ask one of my exchange partners for some food. The resources  exchanged between partners are not limited to food and need not be of the same  kind: humans also exchange labor, support in disputes, and information. Because  success in the foraging niche is so heavily dependent upon cooperation, individuals  must note which of their group members are generous, hard‐working, dependable,  trustworthy, kind, and/or good‐natured, and which are not. They must also  monitor the trajectories of friendships, sexual relationships, political alliances, and  enmities. And because cooperating with others depends upon being part of a group,  individuals must also learn the rules of membership — i.e., cultural prescriptions  and proscriptions — to avoid expulsion. Furthermore, all of this knowledge must  </page> <page sequence="7"> Foundations of An Evolutionary Literary Curriculum 323 be updated as new developments occur. This is in addition to all the non‐social  knowledge sets individuals must build and maintain. It can be just as important to  know that a recent landslide wiped out the one route to winter camp that avoids  crossing enemy territory or that the caribou have shifted their migration route to  a different river drainage, as it is to know that one’s mate was recently seen in  the berry patch flagrantly flirting with someone else. Death due to enemy attack  or resource failure promptly terminates an individual’s reproductive output, and  jeopardizes the survival of existing offspring.  In sum, one of the resources humans complexly extract from their environment  is information (Boyer; Tooby and Cosmides, “The Past”). However, acquiring  information at first hand can be slow, unpredictable (information might not be  encountered by the time it is needed), energetically costly, and/or dangerous (Kaplan  and Hill). For example, I learned the hard way that female elk will charge if you get  too close to their newborn offspring, which are difficult to detect in the tall grass. A  few hours later, I was given this same information by a park ranger. This incident  neatly illustrates the complex solution humans have evolved in response to the  costs and risks associated with firsthand information acquisition: social learning.  Social learning is supported by a suite of adaptations that motivate and enable us to  share information with and acquire information from other humans, including joint  attention (e.g. Carpenter et al.; Scaife and Bruner), shared intentionality (Tomasello  et al.), and language (Dunbar). Social learning is equally useful for acquiring social  and non‐social information, as well as information that is consistently true (e.g.  cedar and willow are good for making fire; acorns are toxic; bears can kill you)  and contingently true (e.g. coho salmon used to run in this river; the recent spell  of warm weather might have melted the snow on the pass; if Marc doesn’t stop his  possessive behavior, Jennifer will leave him). At this point, we have a description of the generative context of storytelling  (the “where”) that we can bring to bear on our definition of storytelling (the  “what”). Storytelling, the reader will recall, is the exchange of representations of  human experience. The conditions under which this behavior emerged were (1)  entry into an ecological niche dependent on a broad skill and knowledge base; (2)  a life history characterized by an extended period of growth and learning; and (3)  cooperation‐based group living that includes extensive information sharing. Under  these conditions, storytelling offers at least one important advantage: acquiring  knowledge through simulated experience avoids the problems inherent in acquiring  knowledge through actual experience. In other words, storytelling offers the same  advantage that social learning does.  </page> <page sequence="8"> 324 Michelle Scalise Sugiyama Cognitive Foundations of Narrative. We turn next to the “how” of storytelling.  The generation of narrative is dependent on numerous cognitive capacities (e.g.  language, cause‐and‐effect reasoning, temporal ordering of experienced events), but  it is highly unlikely that these evolved for narrative processing per se. Rather, because  narrative is a format for representing human experience, many of the capacities that  scaffold the processing of real‐world events scaffold narrative processing as well.  Theory of mind is a case in point. This system consists of a suite of capacities that  enable us to understand that other human beings have mental states (e.g. beliefs,  feelings, desires), to interpret others’ mental states, and to make predictions about  others’ behavior based on their mental states (or vice versa). Theory of mind can be  thought of as social cause‐and‐effect reasoning: when reasoning about the physical  environment, we explain action in terms of physical forces such as gravity; when  reasoning about the social environment, we explain action in terms of mental states,  such as wanting, imagining, or forgetting. In other words, theory of mind enables  us to think about how others might respond to our actions. For example, if I try  to steal my best friend’s boyfriend, my theory of others minds tells me that she  will probably get angry with me and want to dissolve our friendship. Thus, theory  of mind is integral to interacting and cooperating with others, which — as noted  above — is critical to survival in the foraging niche.  Because story characters are almost always representations of humans or  anthropomorphized agents, theory of mind is also integral to narrative processing  (Scalise Sugiyama, “Reverse‐Engineering”; Zunshine). As we follow a story,  we continually generate hypotheses regarding the characters’ mental states (e.g.  “Othello is suspicious and jealous”), make predictions regarding their actions  based on those mental states (e.g. “Othello’s jealousy might drive him to harm  Desdemona”), and interpret their actions in terms of mental states (e.g. “Othello’s  jealousy and misplaced trust caused him to destroy a good marriage”). Theory of  mind is also integral to storytelling. At the very least, the storyteller must be able  to attribute the mental state comprehension to the audience. Skilled storytellers go  far beyond this, monitoring, predicting, and/or manipulating the audience’s belief  and emotion states in order to sustain their interest and influence their behavior  (Scalise Sugiyama, “Origins”).  Another important cognitive component of narrative is pretense. Although not  all narratives are fictions, many are. Fiction is an odd phenomenon: all normally‐ developing humans are capable of imagining persons, events, and places that  are not real. Why might precious neural tissue be dedicated to such a seemingly  useless ability? The answer is that pretense is merely one manifestation of a larger,  </page> <page sequence="9"> Foundations of An Evolutionary Literary Curriculum 325 extremely valuable capacity: the ability to represent contingently true information  (Cosmides and Tooby, “Consider”). The ability to reason contingently enables us  to engage in “mental time travel” (Tulving) — to visualize past scenarios (i.e.,  remember past actions/events) and imagine possible future scenarios (i.e., plan  future actions/events). The ability to hold in mind events that are not happening  now — events that happened in the past, have not happened yet, and/or might  never happen — provides us with the raw material for imagination. It enables us  to visualize possible series of actions (past, present, or future) which, coupled with  our understanding of causal relations and our ability to make inferences based on  this knowledge, enable us to invent, manufacture, and use tools; track animals;  find our way through the environment; and predict human behavior (Cosmides and  Tooby, “Consider”). The advantage of counterfactual reasoning is that it enables us  to innovate. Humans need not wait for natural selection to produce adaptations in  response to the plethora of problems continually presented by people, prey, predators,  and parasites (Cosmides and Tooby, “Consider”). Counterfactual reasoning enables  us to improvise a solution on the fly — to envision possible series of events and  possible outcomes of those events, and choose the one that best solves the problem  at hand (Tooby and DeVore).  Tooby and Cosmides (“Does Beauty”) argue convincingly that one of the  functions of pretense is to provide information inputs to cognitive mechanisms in  order to facilitate their assembly and/or calibration. In other words, participating  in imaginary worlds is a means of acquiring knowledge. When I pretend that I am  stalking a deer, or imagine someone stalking a deer, I acquire information and/ or skills that are useful for actually stalking a deer. Thus, engaging in imaginary  worlds may be one of the means by which humans acquire the extensive skill and  knowledge sets demanded by occupation of the foraging niche. This in turn offers a  possible explanation for the strange phenomenon of sharing narratives with others.  At this point our focus shifts from narrative (representational format) to storytelling  (behavior), and several additional cognitive capacities come into play: language,  cooperation, episodic memory, social learning, and manipulation.  Language almost certainly predates the emergence of storytelling, because  before humans evolved the ability to communicate in a rich and subtle manner, it  would have been virtually impossible for them to share representations of experience  with one another (fictional or otherwise). Non‐verbal media are highly inefficient  and imprecise narrative devices (Scalise Sugiyama, “Reverse‐Engineering”). Any  doubters need only imagine themselves listening to Prokofiev’s Peter and the Wolf  without the accompanying narration or any foreknowledge of the story the music  </page> <page sequence="10"> 326 Michelle Scalise Sugiyama “tells.” Where is the story set, and when? Who are the principal characters? What  are their beliefs, values, and intentions? What actions do they perform? What  events befall them? What is the central conflict in the story, and how is it resolved? Because storytelling involves the sharing of simulations of experience, another  cognitive capacity key to understanding this behavior is cooperation. The benefit of  being the recipient (i.e., audience) of a story is that acquiring knowledge through  simulated experience tends to be less costly than acquiring it through first‐hand  experience. Thus, storytelling is a form of social exchange in which the good  provided is information. On this view, an important benefit of storytelling is that it  can expand an individual’s knowledge base exponentially by giving him/her access  to the experiences of other individuals, both living and deceased. Because narrative  simulates human experience, listening to stories enables us to “observe” events and  behavior much as we do in real life (Scalise Sugiyama, “Reverse‐Engineering”).  And because story structure “mimics the format in which experienced events are  mentally represented and stored in memory” (Tooby and Cosmides, “Does Beauty”  24), the “experience” we gain by listening to stories can be input into episodic  memory (Scalise Sugiyama, “Forager Oral Tradition”). Episodic memory, in turn,  is believed to be essential to planning, or the simulation of possible future events:  plans are assembled from events culled from episodic memory (Schacter et al.;  Tulving). Thus, it is possible that listening to stories amplifies an individual’s  ability to generate plans (Scalise Sugiyama, “Forager Oral Tradition”): the more  experiences an individual has to draw on, the greater the range of possible future  scenarios he/she can assemble. Listening to stories also serves to increase an  individual’s sample size of events/actions and consequences/reactions, which may  provide emotional (Tooby and Cosmides, “Past,” “Does Beauty”) and frequency  (Scalise Sugiyama, in preparation) inputs useful for the calibration of relevant  decision‐making mechanisms.  Given the “I’ll‐help‐you‐if‐you‐help‐me” logic of social exchange, we cannot  limit our examination of storytelling to the receiving end of this transaction: the  storyteller must benefit in some way from sharing information with others. The  evolutionary logic of sharing stories is the same as that of social learning. The  benefits of social learning to the donor are consistent with the benefits of kin  selection and social exchange: when you help kin, you help copies of your own  genes, and when you help others, others will be inclined to help you. Similarly,  telling stories to close kin may increase their chances of survival and/or reproduction,  thereby helping copies of the storyteller’s own genes. Telling stories to non‐kin may  </page> <page sequence="11"> Foundations of An Evolutionary Literary Curriculum 327 motivate reciprocal generosity toward the storyteller, in the form of information  or other valuable resources.  Another benefit that sharing stories potentially offers the storyteller is  manipulation. Although group living has its advantages, it also presents a formidable  challenge: the interests of group members often come into conflict. For example,  a parent’s goal (e.g. marry daughter to headman) might conflict with a child’s  goal (e.g. marry the man of her choice). Or a young man’s goal (e.g. raid enemy  camp to steal horses) might conflict with those of his elders (e.g. do not provoke  the enemy at this moment). Thus, there are times when an individual can benefit  from persuading others to modify their goals and behavior such that they serve  his/her interests. Like gossip, stories are a highly effective means of disseminating  information strategically — both the timing and the content of the message can be  manipulated for the purpose of influencing the beliefs and actions of others. For  example, storytelling can be used to model cultural norms: a story may illustrate  the rewards of engaging in prescribed behaviors and/or the pitfalls of engaging in  proscribed behaviors, thereby motivating group members to adhere to the former and  avoid the latter. Stories may also be used to enforce cultural norms by serving as a  subtle, proactive form of social sanctioning. In forager societies, where there are no  police, legal systems, or prisons, peace is maintained largely through various forms  of social sanctioning, including criticism (e.g. Boehm, “Egalitarian,” “Hierarchy”;  Lee; Marshall). This tactic is highly effective in small‐scale societies, where survival  is dependent on cooperation, and cooperation is dependent on maintaining the good  will of one’s fellows. Storytelling offers a means of criticizing antisocial behavior:  a character’s behavior can be openly condemned by other characters in the story  and, implicitly or explicitly, by the narrator as well. This sends a message to the  audience that persons engaging in such behavior will incur the wrath of the group  (Scalise Sugiyama, “Social Mapping,” “Forager Oral Tradition”). Variations on  this tactic include the use of monster stories to frighten children into obedience:  in these stories, group disapproval is replaced by a terrifying monster that carries  off children who misbehave (Scalise Sugiyama, “Forager Oral Tradition”; Scalise  Sugiyama &amp; Sugiyama, “Once”).  Why Humans Tell Stories. By now it should be obvious that, when one takes  as one’s starting point the ecological and cognitive foundations of storytelling,  hypotheses regarding its function(s) arise as a matter of course. The fact that  stories are shared leads inescapably to the hypothesis that storytelling is a form of  cooperation. This, in turn, suggests that stories contain a valuable resource. The  observations that narrative is a format for representing experience, that the human  </page> <page sequence="12"> 328 Michelle Scalise Sugiyama ecological niche is knowledge‐intensive, and that humans have evolved the ability to  learn from the experience of others suggest that the valuable resource shared through  storytelling is experience — that is, knowledge. And the use of recalled experience  (episodic memory) to construct possible future scenarios (plans) suggests that the  benefit of participating in simulated experience (storytelling) is the expansion of  episodic memory and planning ability.  Any hypothesis regarding the function of storytelling will be falsified if it is  inconsistent with the ecological and cognitive foundations of storytelling outlined  herein. Thus, a solid grounding in the prehistory of literature provides students  with an intellectual toolkit for evaluating not only evolution‐based explanations  of storytelling behavior but non‐evolutionary hypotheses as well, such as those  advanced by postmodern literary theory. Indeed, one of the advantages of taking a  biology‐based approach to literary study is that hypotheses regarding the function  of literature can be tested both in the field and against existing psychological and  anthropological evidence.  Relevant Texts: Forager Oral Tradition The last critical element of literary prehistory that remains to be examined is stories  themselves. For this task, it is important to use an ecologically valid sample. As we  now know, storytelling emerged in a hunting‐and‐gathering context as an oral art  form. Ideally, then, a course on the origins of literature should be grounded in the  study of oral tales from ancestral foraging societies. Unfortunately, these stories are  not available to us, but fortunately, a proxy is at hand — namely, the oral traditions of  modern foraging peoples. Although, as far as we know, the tales of modern foragers  are not part of an unbroken tradition reaching far back into the Paleolithic, they are  the product of similar social and ecological conditions. Thus, the oral traditions of  historically documented foraging peoples are the best approximation we have of  what stories and storytelling were like in ancestral communities.  Examining stories from forager oral tradition returns us to the “what” of  storytelling: we began by defining this behavior; we now turn to describing the  patterns it exhibits in content. Because this course examines storytelling as a  universal human behavior, it examines patterns in this behavior that are exhibited  cross‐culturally. Cross‐cultural patterns in forager story content point to issues  that, among foraging peoples, universally command attention and excite interest.  If storytelling serves as a means of transmitting knowledge, we can predict that  there will be a correlation between recurrent patterns in forager story content and  recurrent challenges and constraints of life in the foraging niche.  </page> <page sequence="13"> Foundations of An Evolutionary Literary Curriculum 329 Cross‐cultural patterns in story content are manifest as universal motifs, themes,  characters, and genres. From the very beginnings of what might be called the study  of comparative oral tradition, one finds a slender but resilient thread of research  dedicated to identifying, categorizing, and/or explaining universal patterns in story  content (e.g. Boas; Campbell; Cox; Fox, “Sexual Conflict”; Frye; Gottschall; Jung;  Kluckhohn; Propp). These patterns have been parsed in numerous ways, with some  focusing on a specific theme or genre (e.g. Fox, “Male Bonding,” “Incest”; Whissell),  and others attempting to anatomize an entire corpus (e.g. Hogan; Thompson).  Origins of Literature parses these patterns in terms of key challenges of the foraging  niche, which are divided into two main categories: the social environment and the  physical environment. In this part of the course, story texts are examined in tandem  with scientific research that describes specific adaptive problems. For each adaptive  problem, a cross‐cultural sample of stories dealing with that problem is examined  in terms of the instrumental information it contains.  One of the most widespread themes in forager oral tradition (and world folklore  in general) is failure to cooperate and the traits that lead to it: free‐riding, laziness,  stinginess, greediness, pride, and self‐centered impulsive behavior that harms the  group. Indeed, an entire genre — the trickster — is dedicated to this subject. The  prevalence of this theme is not surprising, given the importance of cooperation  to buffering foraging and health risk, defending against human and non‐human  predators, acquiring mates, mitigating the costs of rearing offspring, and acquiring  information. The fact that non‐cooperators are universally condemned in forager  oral tradition suggests that storytelling plays a role in maintaining cooperation.  Accordingly, the second half of the course begins by identifying key behavioral traits  of the trickster, which are examined vis‐à‐vis of the logic of the free rider problem  and the use of social sanctioning to prevent/repair breakdowns in cooperation.  The course then examines a specific cooperative relationship, mating, which  is another widespread theme in forager oral tradition. A cross‐cultural sample  of related sub‐themes are examined, including courtship, dissatisfaction with  mate choice, adultery, loss of mate, conflict between co‐wives, conflict between  parents and children regarding mate choice, conflict with in‐laws, and incest, all  of which reflect mating challenges posed by the foraging niche. These sub‐themes  are discussed in terms of the evolutionary roots of mating conflict: mate selection  criteria, long‐term and short‐term mating strategies, paternity uncertainty, and sex  differences in parental investment. The result of successful mating — reproduction  — presents an additional set of challenges, many of which are reflected in cross‐ cultural themes having to do with childhood threats. Monsters are a case in point:  </page> <page sequence="14"> 330 Michelle Scalise Sugiyama a widespread motif in forager oral tradition, many monsters preferentially target  disobedient children, especially those who engage in activities that jeopardize their  lives or the lives of their families (Scalise Sugiyama and Sugiyama, “Once”). This  motif thus references a key problem that prolonged juvenility poses to parents:  protecting children from the dangers to which their incomplete cognitive and  physical development make them highly vulnerable. A related problem commonly  addressed in forager oral tradition is the diminution or loss of parental care due to  the introduction of a stepparent or the death of both biological parents. Examination  of the social environment concludes with the problem of warfare, which is also a  prevalent theme in forager oral tradition (Scalise Sugiyama, “War Stories”). This  theme is examined vis‐à‐vis the imbalance of power hypothesis (Wrangham) and  the instrumental information stories present with regard to this constraint.  Discussion then moves to the challenges posed by the physical environment  — that is, resource extraction and its associated tasks and hazards. Because  information acquisition is critical to acquisition of all other resources, these tasks  and hazards are examined in terms of the skill and knowledge sets they demand.  These include knowledge about distribution of resources across a large territory;  seasonal and long‐term variation in availability of resources; travel routes;  behavior and characteristics of prey animals; coping with resource failure (e.g.  famine, drought); and environmental hazards (e.g. natural disasters, inclement  weather, dangerous topography, animal threats). As with challenges presented by  the social environment, there is a correspondence between challenges presented  by the physical environment and cross‐culturally pervasive themes in forager oral  tradition. Animals are a popular topic: the most common genres being etiological  tales (e.g. how the birds got their colors/markings; habitat and foraging patterns  of the tapir), hunting stories, and encounters with dangerous animals (Scalise  Sugiyama, “Lions”). Famine, too, is a recurrent theme (Sobel and Bettles; Scalise  Sugiyama and Sugiyama, “Frugal”), as are natural disasters and the creation of  landforms (Scalise Sugiyama and Sugiyama, “How”). Although most humans no  longer make their living by hunting and gathering, many of these themes (e.g.,  natural disasters, predators) are also a staple of modern storytelling, and the use  of complex extraction techniques is an integral component of many modern story  genres, such as the spy novel, crime fiction, medical dramas, historical fiction, war  chronicles, and science fiction. This is because resource extraction and many of  its concomitant tasks and hazards are still an integral part of human life, the main  difference being that modern extraction technologies are typically more complex  than those deployed by foragers (e.g. centralized heating instead of fire, surveillance  </page> <page sequence="15"> Foundations of An Evolutionary Literary Curriculum 331 drones instead of war scouts), and are typically produced and executed by specialists  (e.g. electricians, engineers, EMTs).  In forager oral tradition, information about extraction tasks and techniques  is inevitably intertwined with social information. This is due to the structure of  narrative, which is largely organized around human agency (character + goal +  conflict + solution). As noted above, this structure is likely rooted in adaptations for  organizing experiential information: who did what; when, how, why, and to/with  whom they did it; and how others responded. On this view, storytelling behavior  pirates our evolved interest in tracking the social world and the capacities that evolved  to perform this task. Small wonder humans universally find stories interesting and  memorable! Narrative structure provides a highly effective mnemonic device onto  which a wide array of non‐social information can be glommed. As Biesele puts it,  “Folklore and other forms of narrative . . . provide a kind of scaffolding upon which  explicit information about resources can be vividly and memorably hung” (42; see  also Blurton Jones and Konner, 345). The Dreamtime is a case in point. These stories  relate the creation of numerous topographic features (e.g. waterholes, campsites)  by anthropomorphic ancestral beings in the course of their daily subsistence and  social activities. In so doing, these stories familiarize the audience with specific sites,  their relative locations, and the resources associated with them, thereby providing  valuable wayfinding and resource information (Tonkinson). Because the origins of  these features are explained in terms of human actions, the stories may also provide  information about the social world (e.g. cultural norms, gender roles, kinship). Origins of Literature concludes with an examination of the hero genre. The  hero is typically a person (often a young male) who excels in overcoming the  most formidable obstacles to survival and/or reproduction in forager life: fiercely  aggressive animals, domineering or threatening human agents, treacherous  topography, natural disasters, inclement weather, or personifications of these  phenomena (Scalise Sugiyama, “Heroes and Villains”). The hero’s actions frequently  benefit others: typically, the hero neutralizes a danger that threatens and overwhelms  the whole group. In meeting and quelling danger, the hero exhibits many traits that  are highly valued in forager society: helpfulness, fortitude, perseverance, and an  ability to tolerate pain, exhaustion, and privation without complaint. In so doing,  the hero serves as a model of culturally prescribed behaviors — the very opposite  of the trickster. Indeed, the hero and the trickster are complementary genres that  together embody two inextricably linked impulses that drive the dynamics of  human sociality: competition and cooperation. This insight would be lost without  </page> <page sequence="16"> 332 Michelle Scalise Sugiyama an understanding of the key challenges presented by entry into the foraging niche  — that is, without an understanding of literary prehistory.  Discussion Although it focuses on our foraging past, the body of knowledge outlined here  provides an interpretive framework for all literature. It provides students with the  psychological and anthropological background needed to frame questions about  universally recurrent themes, genres, and formal elements, such as male bonding  (Fox, “Male Bonding”), romance (Kruger et al. 2003; Nesse; Salmon and Symons  2004; Whissel), the trickster (Scalise Sugiyama, “Social Mapping”), the agonistic  structure of narrative (Carroll et al.), mimesis (Storey), and even the size of social  networks portrayed in stage plays (Stiller et al.). An understanding of the ecological  and cognitive foundations of literature also prepares students to evaluate a wide  array of evolution‐based hypotheses regarding the functions and/or universal appeal  of literature, such as: advertising fitness to prospective mates (Miller); evaluation  of alternative courses of action (Pinker; Scalise Sugiyama, “Food”); assembly and  calibration of certain cognitive structures (Tooby and Cosmides, “Does Beauty”);  broadcasting and enforcement of social norms (Scalise Sugiyama, “Social Mapping,”  “Forager Oral Tradition”); rehearsal of theory‐of‐mind capacities (Zunshine); and  manipulation of the beliefs and behavior of others (Scalise Sugiyama, “Origins”). It  also enables students to assess the viability of alternative theoretical models — e.g.  Marxism, feminism, psychoanalysis — by comparing their assumptions regarding  human motivational systems with recent advances in the understanding of cognitive  function and design (e.g. Gottschall; Scalise Sugiyama, “New Science”).  Many of the ideas presented in Origins of Literature are consistent with the  tenets of both an older literary tradition (e.g. art imitates life) and a newer one  (e.g. art perpetuates/subverts hegemonic ideology). An evolutionary approach does  not supercede these traditions; it strengthens them. The advantage of a biology‐ based approach is that it provides a means of testing and supporting foundational  assumptions of literary study. If we make assertions about the nature and function  of literature without providing evidence to back them up, we deprive our students  of the tools needed for critical evaluation. Mimesis is a case in point. To evaluate  the claim that literature imitates life, we can look at current research in cognitive  psychology and cognitive neuroscience on mental design and function. This  research overwhelmingly supports the conclusion that the mind is designed to  organize and respond to information inputs from the environment in ways that  tended to promote fitness over evolutionary time‐spans: an individual possessed  of a mind that produced unreliable representations of environmental stimuli would  </page> <page sequence="17"> Foundations of An Evolutionary Literary Curriculum 333 not survive for long. Narrative appears to be a representational format dedicated to  the organization of experience. If our representations of experience did not reliably  correspond to (“mirror”) regularities in the human physical and social environment,  there would be no point in sharing them with others because there would be no  reason for anyone to listen. Similarly, if we assert but do not demonstrate that  literature is an ancient and integral part of human life, there is no reason for anyone  to listen — let alone believe us.
