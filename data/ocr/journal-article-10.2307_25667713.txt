Keyser ABSTRACT The DesRosier rockshelter is located in the Smith River drainage in central Montana, just east of the Continental Divide. Although the deep, stratified, culture-bearing deposit in the shelter has been test excavated and the recovered artifacts described, pictographs in the shelter and in an associated rock structure have never been discussed. My analysis of these pictographs demonstrates that they are repre sentative of the Columbia Plateau rock art style, and in conjunction with the rock structure, were used as part of a vision quest ceremony. INTRODUCTION The DesRosier site, 24ME1002, is a small rockshelter in the Smith River Drainage of central Montana (Fig. 1), approximately 50 km northwest of White Sulphur Springs. The deep, culture-bearing deposit in the rock shelter was test-excavated in 1972 and 1973 by the landowner, Fred DesRosier, and members of the Milk River Archaeological Society under the direction of John Brumley (Brumley 1974). Although the recovered artifacts were analyzed and reported shortly thereafter, only passing mention was made of the fact that pictographs also occur in the rockshelter (Brumley 1974:1), and no mention was made of a small rock structure located just to the east of the cave. During the summer of 1977, while recording rock art sites elsewhere in the Smith River drainage, the author visited the DesRosier site and noted significant differences between the picto graphs there and those of the Central Montana abstract style found at nearby sites (Keyser 1977a; Shumate 1960). The Des Rosier site pictographs are reported here to document the areal extent of the Columbia Plateau pictograph style and to enable a better understanding of the function of the DesRosier site. THE SITE DesRosier rockshelter is situated on the south side of a high, steep "hogback" ridge of Madison limestone (Fig. 2) in the drainage of Antelope creek, a second-order tributary of the Smith River. The small rockshelter is approximately 8 m wide at the mouth, 4 m deep, and presently about 3 m high at the mouth. The roof slopes sharply downward to an average height of just over 1 m at the back wall. The present floor is the top of a 2 m thick deposit composed of aeolian sediments and roof spalls (Brumley 1974:5-6). The southeast facing rockshelter overlooks the upper Smith River valley and provides a panoramic view of the valley floor and the Dry Range?an extensive pine parkland upland to the east between the site and the Smith River.

Note Big Belt Mountains in distance. hogback, is a low, single-course rock struc ture composed of three small, contiguous, ovoid rock walls (Fig. 3). The structure is formed of 109 limestone blocks ranging from 15 to 65 cm in maximum dimension. The component stones are approximately one third buried in the shallow soil atop the rocky ridgecrest. Three small living limber pines of undetermined age interrupt the wall on the west side of the structure. The displacement of the wall stones adjacent to the trees indicates that they have grown significantly since the structure was built, but it is not possible to determine if the structure was originally constructed around them. Vegetation in the site area is predominantly open sagebrush-bunchgrass prairie with scat tered pines on the uplands, including the Dry Range and the crest and sheltered north slope of the hogback on which the rockshelter is located. Just west of the site lie the Big Belt Mountains, the east slopes of which are covered by a moderately dense coniferous forest. THE PICTOGRAPHS The pictographs at the DesRosier Rock shelter are faded red figures that have suffered some leaching and fading due to the seepage of water across the porous lime stone. The red pigment used to paint the pictographs has hot been chemically an alyzed, but it appears to be derived from iron oxide. Iron oxides have been identified as the pigment used to paint similar pictographs in this region (Keyser and Knight 1976:7; Elrod 1908:6), and iron oxide sources are common in this area of central Montana. Because of the "blocky" configuration of the rockshelter walls (Fig. 3), the pictographs are painted as single motifs, or small groups, on smooth surfaces scattered across the rear wall of the shelter. One group of tally marks is painted on the smooth face of a projecting block near the rockshelter mouth. There are 12 distinct motifs and four small paint smears in DesRosier rockshelter. The recognizable motifs are painted in a flat red pigment and composed of finger-width lines, indicating that the figures were finger painted. Motifs include a stick-figure anthro pomorph, a sunburst, a chevron, a pair of ribbed figures, and eight groups of tally marks. The anthropomorph (Figs. 4, 5a) is a simple front view, stick-figure human nearly 10 cm tall, with arms and legs indicated by shallow inverted Vs. The head is a small dot, and the dependent phallus identifies the figure as male. Hands and feet are not depicted. The sunburst (Fig. 5b) is a small, open circle 7 cm in diameter, with seven short projecting rays, all 1-2 cm long. The chevron (Fig. 5d) is composed of two rows of five diagonally oriented, upward pointing lines, 4-7 cm in length. The 10 lines are somewhat irregularly spaced, but they appear to have been intended as five pairs. The ribbed figures (Fig. 5e) consist of a central vertical line with shallow, inverted, V-shaped crossbars. The longest measures 15 Fig. 3. Rock structure at DesRosier site.

The other is 10 cm long with three crossbars. The tally marks (Fig. 5c) are groups of short, evenly spaced, vertically oriented lines. Although the marks vary slightly in length, thickness, and spacing, all of them in any particular series are relatively consistent in these attributes, and the paint is applied evenly along the full length of the line. Tally marks range from one single mark to groups of six. Two groups have horizontal lines connecting the tops of the individual marks to form "rake" figures (Fig. 5c). The paint smears are amorphous, faded patches of unevenly applied, smeared pig ment. Their overall form suggests that they are not faded motifs, hence, they are probably areas where paint was mixed or applicators cleaned. COMPARISONS AND INTERPRETATIONS The pictographs at the DesRosier site appear to represent the Columbia Plateau rock art style, examples of which are widespread in western Montana, Idaho, northeastern Washington, and British Colum bia (Grant 1967:92-99; Keyser and Knight 1976; Erwin 1930; Corner 1968) and, infre quently, at a few sites along the east flanks of the Rocky Mountains (Keyser 1978, 1979). The DesRosier site pictographs are apparently not related to the Central Montana abstract style rock art found at numerous nearby central Montana sites (Shumate 1960; Keyser 1977a, 1979). All motifs at the DesRosier site are representative of Columbia Plateau style rock art. The phallic stick-figure anthropomorph is nearly identical to numerous examples at sites in western Montana (Keyser and Knight 1976:4, Fig. 2c) and British Columbia (Corner 1968:60-69, 75). Stick-figure anthropomorphs also occur in Central Montana abstract style rock art (Keyser 1979:156-157), but they are notably uncommon in Northwestern Plains rock art (Keyser 1977b:28; Conner and Conner 1971:18-21; Conner 1962:6). Sunbursts, similar to that at the DesRosier site, are also a common component of Columbia Plateau rock art (Keyser and Knight 1976:3, 6-7; Keyser 1979:166; Corner 1968:57, 75, 92, 111); however, they occur infrequently in the Northwestern Plains and Central Montana abstract rock art styles (Keyser and Knight 1976:8; Keyser 1977b:49, 1979:163, 166). The ribbed figures and chevron design are repeated numerous times in Columbia Plateau rock art (Keyser and Knight 1976:6-8; Corner 1968:44, 47, 64), but on the Northern Plains they occur only at a few sites as part of the Central Montana abstract art style (Shumate 1960:21). The tally marks at the site are probably the best indicator that these pictographs are part of the Columbia Plateau art style. Tally marks are the most common component of Colum bia Plateau pictography (Keyser and Knight 1976:8) and, as at the DesRosier rockshelter, they are often the predominant motif at a site.

In summary, the types of motifs found at the DesRosier site are only occasionally encountered in Central Montana abstract art and Northwestern Plains rock art?the two art styles that predominate in this area of the plains. Just as importantly, however, motifs characteristic of Northern Plains art (e.g., horsemen, guns, shield bearing warriors, and V-necked anthropomorphs) and of the Central Montana art style (e.g., handprints, geo metric mazes) are absent at the DesRosier site. These data serve to further distinguish the art at DesRosier rockshelter from that found at most other sites in the region. Several lines of ethnographic and archae ological evidence indicate that the DesRosier site pictographs and the nearby stone structure functioned as part of a ritualized vision quest ceremony central to the religion of the Columbia Plateau Salishan tribes. The pictographs and stone structures are located on a high, isolated ridge in the foothills of the Big Belt Mountains, and the site commands a panoramic view of the upper Smith River valley to the south and southeast (Brumley 1974:3). Such isolated foothills locations were specifically chosen as vision quest sites by members of Salishan tribes (Malouf, personal communication 1975 and unpublished field notes cited in Taylor 1973:69). Additionally, accumulated ethnographic evidence indicates that rock structures were constructed as part of the Salishan vision quest. Among the Columbia Plateau tribes, a person seeking supernatural power would retire to a secluded place to contact a guardian spirit, and while there he would construct a low stone structure (Turney-High 1937:27; Teit 1930: 282), in which to sit or lie during his fast. Lasso Stasso, a member of the Flathead Lake Kutenai band, recalled his use of such a site: ... I went up on top of Chief Rock, near Day ton, just above Black Lake. Up there is a little circle of rocks where we would lay. All kinds of spirits dwell up there, like birds, animals, rocks, everything. Coyote spoke to me up there one night (Malouf and White 1952:3). A structure similar to that located near the DesRosier rockshelter and possibly associated with a nearby pictograph panel was found along the Kutenai River in northwestern Montana (Taylor 1973:67-72). Rock art also played a part in Columbia Plateau vision questing. Ethnographers (Teit 1930:194, 283; Malouf 1961) document the use of pictographs to commemorate a successful vision. Baptiste Mathias, an elderly Kutenai, described the function of such paintings: . . . Indians . . . went to these places to seek nipika (supernatural powers possessed by guardian spirits). They . . . (painted) their names down there (at 24LA1026 on Flathead Lake in western Montana) and how many days they were there (Malouf and White 1953:31). In addition to the ethnographic evidence, archaeological research elsewhere in the Columbia Plateau has shown that pictographs nearly identical to those at DesRosier rock shelter are associated with the vision quest (Keyser and Knight 1976:9-11; Malouf 1961:9; Corner 1968:4). At these sites, the vision quest pictographs depict humans, animals, and various super natural objects and paraphernalia (Keyser and Knight 1976; Corner 1968). The motifs at the DesRosier site apparently also depict things of a supernatural nature, since the simple stick-figure human is loosely associated with a sunburst, a chevron, and two ribbed figures. In Salishan religion celestial objects were thought to possess supernatural power and the sun was regarded as an exceptionally powerful guardian (Ray 1939:82). In addition, the chevron design and ribbed figures at the site may represent fir or cedar branches. Similar designs at British Columbia pictograph sites have been ethnographically identified as fir and cedar branches (Corner 1968:29) used in conjunction with puberty rites and religious purification ceremonies, both of which are associated with vision questing (Corner 1968:27). The DesRosier site pictographs cannot be reliably dated, but the absence of historic objects suggests a prehistoric period age. Rock paintings of this type weather very slowly, and evidence from other sites in Montana and British Columbia indicates that pictographs like these could be as much as several hundred years old (Keyser and Knight 1976:10; Corner 1968:13-15). The super imposition of Columbia Plateau style picto graphs over Central Montana abstract style 274</page><page sequence="5">motifs at 24CA102 in the Smith River drainage (Keyser 1979:166) suggests that Columbia Plateau rock art is the latest art style in this region, supporting the inference that the DesRosier site pictographs were painted during the last few hundred years. The DesRosier pictographs are probably of Pend d'Oreille or Flathead (Salish) origin. Similar Columbia Plateau style pictographs in Western Montana and British Columbia have been attributed to the Salish and Pend d'Oreille (Keyser and Knight 1976:11; Malouf 1961:6; Corner 1968), and early ethnog raphers found members of several interior Salishan-speaking tribes still familiar with the meaning and function of paintings like these (Teit 1930; Corner 1968). Although the site is located on the periphery of the Northwestern Plains, further east than the classic, better-known examples of Columbia Plateau style pictographs (e.g., Keyser and Knight 1976; Corner 1968), there are a few similar pictographs along the eastern flank of the Rocky Mountains that have been identified as Columbia Plateau art (Malouf 1961:5-6; Keyser 1978, 1979:166). Support for the affiliation of these paintings with the Pend d'Oreille or Flathead is provided by the extensive ethnohistoric evidence documenting that the Smith River and adjacent Missouri River headwaters region was inhabited by both of these groups during the period from approximately A.D. 1400 1800 (Malouf 1967:3-6, 14-15; Teit 1930). CONCLUSIONS DesRosier rockshelter is a small limestone overhang in the Smith River drainage of central Montana that has a few red Columbia Plateau style pictographs on.the rear wall and ceiling. Just east of, but associated with, the shelter is a low rock structure composed of three small contiguous, ovoid, single-course walls. Although the site is located on the western periphery of the Northern Plains, the pictographs are part of the Columbia Plateau rock art style more commonly found to the west throughout western Montana and British Columbia. Analysis of the motifs and compar ison to known sites indicate that the paintings and rock structure are the result of a vision quest ritual such as those practiced by the Flathead or Pend d'Oreille Tribes. Similar pictographs and vision questing structures are common in the western Montana mountain valley homelands of these tribes. Limited evidence suggests that the pictographs are 200-400 years old, an inference that is supported by the ethnohistoric documenta tion that this region was inhabited by the Flathead and Pend d'Oreille between A.D. 1400-1800.
