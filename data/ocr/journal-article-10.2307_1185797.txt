<plain_text><page sequence="1">DANCING GODS: ERNA FERGUSSON'S TRAVELS TOWARD EXOTICISM Robert F. Gish AS WITH ANY SUBJECT OF COMPLEXITY and tradition, there are many starting points when considering the Southwest and exoticism. One obvious beginning is with the travel book or travelog, for it is this genre which most explicitly attempts to account for the intru- sions of light-skinned peoples in dark-skinned worlds. The twentieth- century travel writer, Erna Fergusson, and her first southwestern travel book, Dancing Gods (1931), is a case in point in that both its theme and method place it squarely within the tradition of literary and historical exoticism. Although Fergusson aspired to write fiction and worked for a time on short stories and on a novel about Malinche, the mistress of Cortez, it was as an "exotic" travel writer in the first half of the twen- tieth century that Fergusson made her most significant contribu- tions. Her most lasting work, ironically, is a book on southwestern cooking, Mexican Cookbook (1934), which after several editions is still in print and today is regarded as a classic.1 As a New Mexico writer of the 1930s Fergusson was a part of what literary historians of the Southwest generally term the Southwestern Renaissance, that period in the twenties and thirties centered around the artist colonies of Taos and Santa Fe and boast- ing a membership which included Witter Bynner, Haniel Long, Willard "Spud" Johnson, Oliver La Farge, Paul Horgan, Mary Austin, Mabel Dodge Luhan, and, for a time, D.H. Lawrence. It was Lawrence, among moderns, who, in New Mexico and Mexico, most dramatically rekindled the exoticism of much earlier travel writers such as Gaspar Perez Villagra; and it was Lawrence who most dramatically pointed the way for writers like Fergusson. Lawrence's essays about the Southwest were especially signifi- cant in transporting and transvaluating some of the assumptions of Anglo-European and, particularly, British writers-and their exoti- cism of Empire-to the modern American Southwest. As an English- man and as a modern tourist, Lawrence saw southwestern locales and, particularly, Native Americans in a new, more empathetic way- Robert F. Gish is Director of Ethnic Studies at California Polytechnic University in San Luis Obispo. 361</page><page sequence="2">362 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, SUMMER 1992 a way which set the stage for revisionist American perspectives of the twenties and thirties such as those of William Carlos Williams, Witter Bynner, Erna Fergusson, and, later in the century, Frank Waters, John Nichols, Edward Abbey, Tony Hillerman, and others. In his southwestern writings Lawrence was characteristically involved in a process of transvaluation, of taking something generally disparaging or just commonplace and holding it up to the iconoclas- tic set of values by which he lived. And this flip-flop is precisely why the Southwest and its native peoples were important to him. As a place and as an experience the Southwest would not allow itself to be taken for granted. It woke him up. It served as a source of insight and inspiration-just as it did for Fergusson. The contemporary Chicano novelist, Rudolfo A. Anaya, similarly describes his life in the South- west as an "epiphany in landscape."2 Lawrence was always enthusiastic about epiphany in landscape, about spirit of place-as was Fergusson. Here is a portion of Lawrence's familiar but still provocative commentary about what New Mexico, for example, meant to him-and could mean to others if they were ready for its epiphanies, its inspirations, its revelations: The know-it-all state of mind is just the result of being outside the mucous-paper wrapping of civilization. Underneath is everything we don't know and are afraid of knowing. I realized this with shattering force when I went to New Mexico. New Mexico, one of the United Sates, part of the U.S.A. New Mexico, the picturesque reservation and playground of the eastern states, very romantic, old Spanish, Red Indian, desert mesas, pueb- los, cowboys, penitentes, all of the film-stuff. Very nice, the great Southwest, put on a sombrero and knot a red kerchief round your neck, to go out in the great free spaces! That was New Mexico wrapped in the absolutely hygienic and shiny mucous-paper of our trite civilization. That is the New Mexico known to most of the Americans who know it at all. But break through the shiny sterilized wrapping, and actually touch the coun- try, and you will never be the same again.3 Lawrence came to the Southwest as a world traveler, an exile in exotic places: Ceylon, Sicily, Australia, California, New Mexico. His reaction to the exoticism and epiphany of the Southwest? He states it this way: "The moment I saw the brilliant, proud morning shine high up over the deserts of Santa Fe, something stood still in my soul, and I started to attend.... In the magnificent fierce morning of New Mexico one sprang awake, a new part of the soul woke up suddenly, and the old world gave way to a new" ("New Mexico," p. 142). Stanley Walker, of another, less effusive and less exotic mind and mood, took it upon himself in a New Yorker piece to complain about</page><page sequence="3">DANCING GODS 363 Lawrence and his brand of exoticism, his lyricism, a style he equated with "babbling," and which he said was shared by Erna Fergusson and others of the same tradition-all victims of what might be called the "Southwestness" of the country and thus a resultant style which Walker satirically called "New Mexico baroque": One either thinks 'New Mexico baroque' is great or one doesn't. An odd thing happens to writers who live in the high country, especial- ly in the mystical stretches along the Rio Grande above El Paso. It happened to poor old D. H. Lawrence, to Mabel Dodge Luhan, and to many others-to a lesser degree to such a sound citizen as Miss Erna Fergusson. They see the mountains, the sand, the stars, the cactus, the wrinkled Indians, and they begin to babble about 'time' and 'space.' At best, and in moderate doses, this can be fetching lit- erature; at its worst it can be baffling-like something by Dylan Thomas out of Sitting Bull.4 Never really the baroque babbler Walker claims, Lawrence sim- ply said, "for greatness of beauty I have never experienced anything like New Mexico" (p. 142). A large part of that experience was the Native Americans which Lawrence encountered in the Southwest. They influenced him greatly-as they did Fergusson. And that influ- ence was essentially exotic. Lawrence's English colleague, W. Somer- set Maugham, defined exoticism this way-albeit in relation to the tradition of the English short story: "[The exotic story] is the story, the scene of which is set in some country little known to the majority of readers, and which deals with the reactions upon the white man in an alien land and the effect which contact with peoples of another race has upon him."5 For Lawrence the American Indian was religious in the oldest and deepest sense of the word, "a remnant of the most deeply reli- gious race still living" (p. 144). It is such a sense of religion, of "God as red," which permeated the New World spirit of place which Lawrence found in New Mexico. Thus his description of various Pueblo dances at Taos, at San Geronimo, and at San Filipi function as the dramatic climax of his New Mexico essay. For five lyrical para- graphs, nearly two full pages of text, Lawrence tells of his memories of the dances: "Never shall I forget," he says. "Never shall I forget"- five times he repeats the phrase in balanced sequence, echoing the rhythms of the drums and chants and the dance steps as he tells of what strange sights he saw and what they meant to him as a prophet of "blood consciousness." William Carlos Williams, in In the Ameri- can Grain (1925), and especially in his account of the discovery of Kentucky, picked up and perpetuated something of the same empa- thetic identification with Native Americans, by focusing on Daniel Boone's "primal lust," and regenerative passion for the New World- a lust and passion which Williams saw as Indian-like; an elan</page><page sequence="4">364 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, SUMMER 1992 unknown (in Williams's assessment) to Puritan and many Spanish perceptions of North America. In her writings about the American Indian tours which she took and often guided, and which resulted in her books about the Southwest, Fergusson was trying to explain a similar sense of won- derment, fascination, and "exoticism" that writers like Lawrence and Williams felt. Fergusson does not quite reach the same level of lyri- cism that Lawrence and Williams do. She is not a tourist like Lawrence-rather she is a guide, someone born to a familiar but nev- ertheless exotic place: the Southwest. As an Anglo and as a woman, she tells of brave and beautiful things, just as other travelers had done before her, in the far-off places of the world wherever colonialism or other forms of "tourism" occurred. Lawrence and Williams were trying to express essentials, not surfaces. And so was Fergusson. Her brother, southwestern novel- ist and historian Harvey Fergusson, attempted to account for his epiphany of landscape, his sense of the exotic, in Rio Grande (1931), his collection of a dozen historical essays published first serially and later as a book. As he saw it, the ostensibly strange and remote, the quaint, the picturesque so familiar in tourism publications had little to do with the real Southwest, its essence. The rich and living back- ground which even casual observers could sense in the Southwest as "exotic" in the negative, ethnocentric Anglo-European sense of the word, was, in transvaluated truth, at the heart of the American expe- rience-of America as a new world and of the Southwest as its Native American essence.6 Dancing Gods represents Fergusson's best account of the Native American presence in the Southwest-her travels into exoticism. Her other travel books after Dancing Gods seem only to replicate it, although she wrote for the larger end of defining an entire region in Our Southwest, and for the more focused purpose of describing her home-New Mexico. She wrote repeatedly about her travels through the Southwest and South America, but it is Dancing Gods which best captures the kind of travel book she was suited to write, the kind of book which in a special way allowed her the opportunity for her own kind of exotic "dancing." No less a critic than the late Edmund Wilson, identifying himself as an Easterner and as a journalist rather than an anthropologist or a Santa Fe aesthete, attributes his traveling to Zuni Pueblo in 1947, to see the Shalako ceremony, to the influence of Dancing Gods.7 Wilson's own account of his trip to this famous pueblo-in its own right an exemplary piece of travel writing-offers good evidence as to just what kind of audience Fergusson had in mind when explaining the exotic ritual and ceremony of southwestern Native American dances: someone appreciative of powers of description, a person of</page><page sequence="5">DANCING GODS 365 intelligence, of respectful sensitivity and curiosity, and one desirous of making the journey into the dark-skinned, primal world of south- western Indians. Just as Fergusson relies on numerous scholarly resources, so too does Wilson rely on Fergusson's book as his primary resource and guide. That he relies on Fergusson as more than mere motive in his seeking the exotic wonders of the Shalako is obvious enough because he quotes extensively from Dancing Gods in an attempt to explain and understand the ceremony. One can only assume that Fergusson appreciated Wilson's com- mentary and the mutually shared sense of what Wilson calls the "spectacular," the difficulties which he describes in getting to Zuni, and in finally seeing such an exotic phenomenon as the Shalako cere- mony before it could disappear. In his words, "The journalist like myself, who has reported many hateful and destructive events, wants to get a good look at the Shalako birds, bringers of happy abundance, before they shall have ceased to come, and before the bad liquor of the white man and the worship, perhaps, of some white Fuhrer shall, even for the Zunis, have taken their place" (p. 68). That such destructive forces were at work not just in the Europe of world war but nearby is apparent in Wilson's description of his jumping-off place, Gallup: "The town of Gallup in northwestern New Mexico is one of the most forbidding stops on the Santa Fe railroad. It is a trading post and coal-mining town of the dismal and grimy kind, and the place to which the Indians resort to buy the liquor they are not supposed to have. They get drunk, have their wallets stolen, and come to in the morning in jail" (pp. 8-9). Wilson shares Fergusson's sense that in traveling to Pueblo country, in contrast to the squalor of Gallup where, under white governance, things have generally run amok, they are experiencing something wondrous and worth recording from their Anglo perspectives (Easterner and Westerner, respectively)-for other Anglo readers to be sure, and maybe, given Wilson's picture of Gallup's aberrations, for certain lost Native American souls numbed to the "happy abundance of the Shalako birds." Although Fergusson romanticizes the Shalako ceremony consid- erably more than does Wilson, both of their Zuni travel accounts reflect a certain tough-mindedness and satire, a kinship which must have contributed to Fergusson's book influencing Wilson. As Wilson's essay on Zuni suggests, Fergusson was, in her written tour of Zuni, on the road to something significant for culture generally, for a larger white civilization in need of something as exotically redemptive as the Shalako birds. This urgency of need is stated in her purpose for writing Dancing Gods and in the research and travel behind it: This book attempts to give a description of the principal southwest- ern Indian dances, based upon observation, and an account of their</page><page sequence="6">366 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, SUMMER 1992 significance, based upon all available sources of information. It is not an exhaustive study, for several reasons, the most important of which is that the material available is not exhaustive. A few scien- tists have made detailed studies of a few of the southwestern Indian dances. I have consulted those authorities, I have seen most of the dances which are open to the outsider, I have talked with many people, both whites and Indians, and I have concluded that nobody knows all about Indian dances, not even Indians. [p. xv] Fergusson explicitly identifies herself as an outsider. She appreci- ates the paradox that although born in the Southwest, she is an out- sider by race and by culture. But she is reflective and resourceful, an empathetic "outsider." She knows that she is something of a trailblaz- er, a guide, a personal observer in pursuit of something combining social science with art, scholarly consensus of the time with individu- al subjectivity, history with story, science with art. She does not pre- sume that she knows more than the Indians about their own dances and ceremonies, but she suggests that she knows something special about the dances-at least as much as she is able to discover in her own non-Indian way of knowing. Her implicit premise is that she knows and recognizes the dances as "exotic." Dancing for the gods and with them is one thing. Describing and explaining in writing what she sees is something else again. As stranger in a strange culture she seeks to keep these realizations in the forefront. As Fergusson stipulates in her initial definition of terms, "An Indian dance . . . is a ceremonial, a symbolic representation, a prayer" (pp. xv-xvi). Drawing attention to religious dramas through- out history-from Hebraic to Greek to early Christian to medieval and modern ceremonies-she is insistent on her emphasis that the Zuni dance is both dramatic and religious. Reflecting much of the lib- eral attitudes of her era in relation to benefiting Native Americans, particularly the lobbying efforts of Santa Fe and Taos artists and writ- ers and of theorists and policy makers like John Collier and Edgar Hewett, Fergusson suggests that part of her role as traveler/writer is to help preserve the Native American dances as an art form in the midst of the separation she sees taking place between the religious aspect of the ceremonies and the artistic: "In time, as Indians are weaned from their ancient faiths, it is likely that all their ceremonies will lose meaning ... and it is important that interested white people should help them to preserve their dances as an art form when they no longer serve as a religious form" (p. xxiii). Apparently, Native American ceremonials had little if any person- al religious significance for Fergusson-unlike Lawrence, who osten- sibly saw a much stronger vitalistic kinship, and one not assuming eventual assimilation. The significance of Native American cere- monials to her personally was, it is assumed, primarily aesthetic. And</page><page sequence="7">DANCING GODS 367 the assumptions behind her dichotomy of functions are decidedly eth- nocentric. Whether or not American Indians would want to maintain an organically religious ceremony only as "art" was problematic in Fergusson's era and even more so now. In the worst light, to assert that Indian ceremonials be continued for their artistic aspects also suggests performance for Anglo entertainment. Nevertheless, it is a premise on which much of Dancing Gods is based and which to some degree explains the motivation behind Fergusson's descriptions and interpre- tations of what she sees as "exotic." She organizes Dancing Gods around the dances-seasonal in their purpose and occasions-of the Pueblos, the Hopis, the Navajos, and the Apaches. After a few background pages dealing with the history and the religion of these cultures, she describes thirty or so major dances which non-Indian tourists are allowed to see. Her intent is to re- create as closely as possible the sensations of such an experience to the audiences of the dances and the book itself. She is aided in this attempt by the various photographs of paintings by sixteen prominent New Mexico artists. Of the dozen or so various seasonal Pueblo dances she painstakingly details, the Zuni dances-as Edmund Wilson testifies- are the most meaningful and, to Fergusson, the finest and most exotic. Just why she regards the Zuni dances as superb is in part due to the Zuni allowing visitors to their masked dances which she so admires: "The distinctive feature of Zuni dances is the masks, which are more elaborate, more varied, and in every way more highly devel- oped than any made by other American Indians" (p. 71). And she regards the Zunis as the world's best artists in the making of masks. (The Zunis, in the spring of 1990, finally declared the Shalako dances closed to the public-to tourists who had ignored the guidelines of common courtesy established by the Pueblo elders.) Much of what makes her descriptions so believable is her staging of the scene in quite personal, diary-like terms. The reader soon is con- vinced that the author is no ordinary, gaping tourist; rather, she is a determined, persistent artist in her own right, waiting to stay the extra day or awaken before dawn to experience all the preparations from the best possible vantage point. For example, preparing herself, she also prepares her reader, a silent but enthralled traveling companion, for the fifth day of the Sword-Swallower's dance: Wishing to see the very beginning of the big day, we got up before dawn and went to the sacred plaza. Crossing the village was an eerie walk. It was cold. Lights in only a few houses. No sound at all. Occasionally a blanketed figure slipped from a door and melted into the shadows, not seeing us. We made ourselves as comfortable as we could with many blankets in a corner of the deserted plaza and waited. [p. 79]</page><page sequence="8">368 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, SUMMER 1992 The short sentences with their fragmented effect give the obvious impression of the actual walk, the silence, and the cold. The anticipa- tion is heightened by a certain kind of reverence combined with curiosity. But descriptions of the Sword Swallower's dance, effective as they are, fall short of the report and commentary of the even more exotic Shalako ceremony. Fergusson notes that the Shalako ceremony does not have a defi- nite date but always takes place between late November and late December. And she gives a comprehensive explanation of the prelimi- naries, the ceremony itself, and its aftermath-making clear that all of the stages are related and that as the greatest of all Zuni festivals it marks the culmination of the ceremonial year and functions as a prayer for continued blessings of fertility and harvest. Commemorative of the winter solstice, preparations for the extravaganza continue throughout each year. Forty-nine days before the ceremony, prepara- tions begin with persons designated to represent Sayatasha, a rain god, and the leader of the Mudheads (katchina in the role of clowns), each responsible for counting down the days until the Shalako come. Fergusson is deliberate in not immediately identifying and defining the Shalako dancers, their giant bird-like costumes, their clacking beaks, and the meaning of the term "Shalako." Rather, she builds-small detail by small detail, ritualized step by ritualized step-a composite picture of these special "dancing gods," the atmosphere in which they come, and the overall meaning of their appearance insofar as it can be expressed in words. M. Wright Gill's magnificent painting of the Shalako figure appears strategically in the center of the narrative, serv- ing to subliminally coincide with the arrival of the six Shalako and Fergusson's attempt to describe them and explain their actions. In preparation for the gods' arrival, special Shalako hosts and houses are chosen with special rooms, at a minimum of sixty feet long, and are made ready to greet the Shalako and entertain them. Focusing her descriptions on the last day and the great event itself, Fergusson heightens the sense of exotic wonderment by the use of such words and phrases of inexpressibility as "women do unmention- able things to their insides" (referring to the insides of sacrificial sheep), and "Odors of fresh bread and freshly killed meat and cedar fires and close rooms are indescribable" (p. 94). Precisely because these descriptions are "unmentionable" and "indescribable" the point is made and the effect achieved: the ceremony is inexpressible in words-ultimately beyond the potential of exposition. Adding to the suspense and the spectacle of it all, Fergusson adeptly describes the audience gathered on the "great day": During the last day everything is finished.... Everything has been swept, food is ready, and people begin to appear in their best</page><page sequence="9">DANCING GODS 369 clothes. All day visitors drift in-long-legged Navajos on ponies, the women sitting astride in their voluminous skirts, the men wearing beaver-skin caps; Indians from the Rio Grande pueblos with turquoise to trade; Hopis with ceremonial garments; and a com- plete assortment of white-man types, from families of Mormons from the near-by towns to the Greenwich Village aesthete and Eastern tourists in stiff city clothes. [p. 96] As author and "guide," Fergusson herself is both among and above such visitors. In this instance of Shalako as book she knows more, not all, but more than the other visitors, at least the eastern tourists. Both the reader and the visitors are less informed. But in the universal scheme of things, the reader as actual rather than vicarious visitor will become more nearly initiated as a result of book travel, of reading Dancing Gods. Fifty years after the recording of such a partic- ular yet idealized ceremony, the Shalako as one Anglo-American trav- eler recorded it still lives, print becoming its own reality. The actual entry of the council of gods who prepare the houses for the visit of the Shalako are all that Fergusson's suspense (the visi- tors' and the reader's anticipation merging) has made us hope for. What Wayne Franklin might call the traveler's confrontation with inexpressibility, or F. Scott Fitzgerald our "capacity for wonder," is addressed directly by Fergusson's use of anecdote in relation to the meaning of the word "gods." Fergusson cites anthropologist Matilda Stevenson's adoption of the term "gods" for the Shalako in 1879; and then the author recounts the insistence of a Zuni woman that they are not "gods" at all but something entirely, lexically different: 'They are not gods,' said she; that word is wrong. The Zunis have no gods; they are Ko-Ko.' 'Just so,' said I, expectant pencil poised, 'and what is the English word for Ko-Ko?' 'There is no English word for Ko-Ko. I do not know. It is something different. I cannot tell you how it is to the Zuni, but they are not gods.' [p. 98] Through such a dialogue and in her continued explanations, Fer- gusson succeeds in throwing into ironic relief her own ethos as an "authority," and the title of her book, Dancing Gods. What she is describing are not "gods" at all. To speak of dancing "gods" is to speak of the wrong thing; something too exotic, too inscrutable, be it "Ko-Ko" or "gods" or something else, some other word. Here is how Fergusson faces up to such bafflement: So there it is, as inexplicable as everything Indian must always be to the white man. They are not gods; they are Ko-Ko, and for Ko-Ko there is no English word, and presumably no English idea. It seems likely, from many similar conversations and a sincere effort to get</page><page sequence="10">370 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, SUMMER 1992 the Indian point of view, that the Indian has no anthropomorphic gods. Yet such creatures as these of the Zunis impersonate some- thing divine: possibly merely an aspect of the great hidden spirit, which in one manifestation is so brilliant that the sun is a shield to hide it. [p. 98] Only after such a mystery of word and ritual is confronted by Fer- gusson the traveler and recounted for the reader, is the spectacular entrance of the Shalako described. In such pacing and arrangement is a masterful instance of exposition and narration, one which brings the Shalako episode to a beautiful climax. Nothing in Dancing Gods, or for that matter in all of Fergusson's Southwest travel writing, is as startling and dramatic as her pages on the Shalako ceremony-most notably the actual appearance of the Shalako on one special evening: In a breathless moment of the swift winter dusk the Shalako appear. They come into sight round the shoulder of a hill, looming, as it were on the far side of that deep impassable gulf which forever separates the mind of the Indian from the mind of the white. The six magnificent figures tower above their attendants; the eagle- feathers of their fantastic head-dresses raying like the sun, their flat turquoise faces and upper bodies swaying, their feet looking incred- ibly tiny under the hoop skirts of the double Hopi kirtles. They are about nine feet high, the tallest masks recorded .... The turquoise face is matched by a breast piece, and the white and blue are accen- tuated by a ruff of shining raven's feathers and by long, black hair. The mask is carried on a long pole hidden under the draperies and steadied by a man who also manipulates strings which roll the great bulging eyes and clack the wooden beak as the figure moves. [p. 100] After what Fergusson describes as much precarious swooping and dipping of these giants, and after they cross the causeway con- structed across the river to their sacred resting place, she follows them into the houses which have been fashioned for them, to await their reemergence at midnight when sustained dancing begins. Fergusson's description of the close quarters in the Koyemshi house is presumably intended to provide a kind of "comic" relief to the majesty of the Shalako's entrance. Although the ways of the Shalako and the ways of men are successfully contrasted, the means are too harsh. She portrays the Navajo guests as "unwashed," and greedily hungry. Trying, perhaps, to dramatize the incongruity involved in this meeting of two worlds-Native American and Anglo-Fergusson describes the effect of the Navajos on the non-Indians in these terms: Nowadays only the most intrepid white, or one well protected by smelling-salts, can bear it long. Generally white visitors drift in and out; in when the cold without seems unbearable, out when the thickness of the indoor air forces them to face the cold again.... But aside from this movement near the doors, the audience sits all</page><page sequence="11">DANCING GODS 371 night, quiet and attentive. By midnight many of the restless whites have left and deterioration has begun to attack those who remain. Ladies' city hats are riding at queer angles, figures which started alert and trim have settled awkwardly among the aborigines, men in proper clothes and spats are huddled into the welcome warmth of borrowed blankets. [p. 103] Satirical perhaps. But not really funny. Here, as in other portions of her travel writings, the limitations of Fergusson's ethnocentricity are baldly apparent. The "deterioration" in dress and demeanor which "attacks" the remaining see-it-to-the-end whites who remain, suggests the contagiousness of primitivism as somehow inevitable after prolonged experience "among the aborigines." For today's read- ers, such passages-although effective in personalizing the event- reveal the strain of seemingly subconscious, deep-seated condescen- sion toward Native Americans, especially the Navajo, to which an "Indian" partisan like Fergusson was somehow ironically oblivious. Such moments are few in Fergusson's remaining summation of the Shalako ceremony as it extends over five more days of festivity and the offering of mounds of food and clothing and trinkets given to the Koyemshi for their part in the ceremony. The visitors leave and are long since gone into history. But the motive and method of the Shalako ceremony continue-in the now-secret yearly rituals of the Zuni, and in Erna Fergusson's amazing travels toward exoticism in Dancing Gods. NOTES 1.

Remley finds Fergusson a difficult writer to place and says, "Her work is not a part of a literary tradition, but essentially an isolated phenomenon in the Southwest (she wrote fifty years later than the first great popularizer, Charles F. Lummis, and her work is very different from that of Mary Austin and Paul Horgan). She wrote little fic- tion and no poetry. Hence, she cannot be treated with the usual devices of literary crit- icism" (p. 36). In this essay the attempt is to see Fergusson in the tradition of "exotic" travel writer--an overlooked tradition to be sure. It is, ironically, one of the most fun- damental forms used in expressing, describing, and imagining the Southwest, its Native American and Mexican American cultures, and their interactions with Anglo- American cultures across land, time, space, and climate. Remley, in the best commen- tary on Fergusson to date, does pinpoint three literary techniques used by her: inter- view, informal prose, and exaggeration, characteristic of American humor (pp. 10-11). 2.
