<plain_text><page sequence="1">TYPOLOGY AND THE CENTO OF PROBA Sigrid Schottenius Abstract This article deals with the poetic reuse of Virgil in the Christian cento composed by the fourth century poet Faltonia Betitia Proba focusing on the possibilities and the validity of applying the term 'typology' to the correspondence between Virgil's texts and the biblical narratives. The word cento, meaning "a piece of patchwork" is also the term for a poem where sentences and phrases are extracted from one text and then put together in order to form a new text with a different meaning. The cento composed by the fourth century poet Faltonia Betitia Proba stands out as the earliest Virgilian cento with a Christian theme,1 and with its 694 verses extracted from Virgil's Eclogues, Georgics and Aeneid it is also the longest specimen written in Latin preserved from antiquity Proba's poem retells a selection of key-episodes mainly from Genesis and the Gospels; however, we can be sure that this sort of composition did not meet with uni versal favour among ecclesiastical authorities. Jerome condemned Christian centowriting in a famous letter to Paulinus of Nola (ep. 53, 7) and towards the end of the fifth century we find a "cento about Christ composed out of verses from Virgil" (Centonem de Christo virgilianis conpaginatum versibus) list ed twice among apocryphal texts in the Decretum Gelasianum. On the other hand, her poem seems to have excited some interest among Christian au thors, since we know of at least three Christian Virgilian centos composed shortly after hers,2 and the dedicatory preface to the East Roman Emperor Arcadius and his child found in certain manuscripts indicate that it was not altogether unpopular in its own time. In this paper I want to explore a few problems that arise when trying to approach a text consisting entirely in quotations. For instance, trying to de fine stylistic and narrative idiosyncrasies and the use of figurative language 1 For Proba's text I use C.

Established theories of allusion and intertextuality also proves com plicated,1 since analysis of how one text enters into dialogue with another generally focuses on the part played by brief allusions and occasional man ifestations of intertertextuality in the new literary context. Since each and every verse of the cento will refer to one predetermined sourcetext (in our case Virgil), a modified approach is necessary. One of the most extensive discussions on centonic allusivity is found in the monograph Virgil Recomposed, where Scott McGill studies the secular centos of Late Antiquity. McGill interprets the quotations of the centos in what he calls a "semantic space" between the source-text, the cento itself and sometimes also a model- or target text. The idea is that the distance be tween these texts determines whether the individual quotations actually are alluding to a certain person or event in the source-text or not.2 According to McGill, many verse-units in the centos are used only for their "semantic apt ness". These quotations cannot be interpreted as allusions since they are "too unrelated to the Virgilian contexts from which they derive to generate allusive meaning".3 But, for instance, in the second-century Virgilian cento Medea by Hosidius Geta, the character Medea is largely described with vers es which belong to queen Dido in their original context. McGill thus con cludes that Hosidius Geta in this case does not merely extract linguistic building blocks from Virgil at random, but actually achieves an allusion to the character of Dido.4 In a secular cento this entails that the author establishes a dialogue be tween one Greco-Roman mythological person or event with another, such as Dido with Medea. However in the Christian centos, this will inevitably lead to a dialogue between Judeo-Christian and pagan narratives. Up until recently, this characteristic has been regarded as a weakness rendering the paraphrase inapt.5 Yet, this double referentiality does not necessarily have to 1 Cf. G. Polara, centoni', in G.

The fusion of pa gan and Christian culture is after all the principal aim of Proba's cento, at least if we are to trust what is stated in its introduction. This is the only sec tion of the poem that contains not only verses from Virgil but also a few verses of the poet's own hand. But the whole passage is nonetheless full of typical pagan imagery of poetic inspiration, albeit in the form of a recusatio: the poet no longer needs to "bring the Muses from the Aonian mountain top" (nec libet Aonio de vertice ducere Musas, 14), since she has found a better source of inspiration. The introduction culminates in an invocation to God to be present (praesens, deus) and to raise the poet's mind (enge mentem, 22) for she, vatis Proba, is going to relate "that Virgil sang of the holy gifts of Christ" (Vergilium cecinisse loquarpia mu?era Christi, 23). Over the years this unusual literary method has met with different theo retical approaches, some of which have proven to be particularly fruitful.1 One feature which certainly merits further study is the poet's use of so called 'typology' in order to hold the source and model text together. For in stance, Elizabeth Clark and Diana Hatch have called attention to established biblical typologies being highlighted in the cento, an example being the par allels achieved between Moses and Jesus. In the cento the Virgin Mary is de scribed as raising her baby "in secret", which Clark and Hatch found "rem iniscent of Moses' mother's attempt to conceal her son". From this and other examples these scholars concluded that Proba mainly reproduced the typologies found expressed in the Gospel of Matthew. The impulse for this analysis was Jean Dani?lou's description of typology as strictly biblical exegetical figure denoting a relationship between various biblical events,2 but others have suggested that its use should not be confined to denote on ly biblical correspondences. Frances Margaret Young for instance, describes typology as a general literary device, created through "mimetic symbols, parallel narratives, corresponding characterisations, exemplary patterns, or intertextual resonances",3 and the term "typology" is for example often 1 Cf. e.g. M.

Here, it will serve as a basis for a discussion on how Virgilian characters and events form an 'undersense' or 'sub-text' in Proba's biblical paraphrase. This is illustrated in the passage where the forbidden tree is described by God to Adam and Eve (w. 148-152): est in conspectu ramis felicibus arbos, quam ?eque fas igni cuiquam nec sternere ferro, religione sacra numquam concessa moveri. hac quicumque sacros decerpserit arbore fetus, morte luet merita: nec me sententia vertit. There is a tree in full view with fruitful branches; divine law forbids you to level with fire or iron, by holy religious scruple it is never allowed to be disturbed. And whoever steals the holy fruit from this tree, will pay the penalty of death de servedly; no argument has changed my mind.3 The "tree with fruitful branches", ramis felicibus arbos (148) is a hemistich from the second song of the Georgics (2, 81), forming part of instructions to the farmer. The 'allusive weight'4 is here, at least to my mind, not very im portant and one could argue that this half-verse was incorporated into the cento primarily for its 'semantic aptness'. However, a little further down in verse 151 we find the words of warning to whomever "steals the holy fruit from this tree", hac quicumque sacros decerpserit arbore fetus. Here Proba in corporates a Virgilian half-line referring to the tree and the famous golden bough (sacros ...fetus) in the sixth book of the Aeneid (6, 141). Since in this case there are certain structural similarities between the model-text (God warning Adam and Eve not to eat fruit from the tree of knowledge) and the source-text (the Sibyl instructing Aeneas on how to get down into the realm 1 .

We encounter yet another significant Virgilian tree when the serpent is tempting Eve to eat the fruit. Iamque dies infanda aderat: per florea rura ecce inimicus atrox inmensis orbibus anguis septem ingens gyros, septena volumina versans nec visu facilis nec dictu affabilis ulli 175 obliqua invidia ramo filondente pependit, vipeream spir?ns animam, cui tristia bella ir aeque insidiaeque et crimina noxia cordi. odit et ipse pater: tot sese vertit in ora arrectisque horret squamis, et, ne quid inausum 180 aut intemptatum scelerisve dolive relinquat sic prior adgreditur dictis seque obtulit ultro: "die" ait "o, virgo - luc?s habitamus opacis riparumque toros et prata recentia rivis incolimus -, quae tanta animis ignavia venit? 185 strata iacent passim sua quaeque sub arbore poma, pocula sunt fontes liquidi: caelestia dona adtractare nefas: id rebus defuit unum. quid prohibet causas penitus temptare latentes? uan? superstitio. rerum pars altera adempta est. 190 quo vitam dedit aeternam? cur mortis adempta est condicio? mea si non inrita dieta putaris, auctor ego audendi sacrata resolvere iura. tu coniunx, tibi fas animum temptare precando. dux ego vester ero: tua si mihi certa voluntas, 195 extruimusque toros dapibusque epulamur opimis". And now the unspeakable day was at hand; through the fields of flowers, look, a snake, abominable, hostile, with immeasurable circles, seven huge coils, twisting with seven rolls not easily seen nor courteous in speech to anyone, it hung with hid den hatred from sprouting branch breathing a viper's breath, in its heart sad wars and anger and treachery and harmful crimes. The Father himself hated it; it changed itself so many times in its face and it bristled with its steep scales and, so as not to leave neither wickedness nor trickery undared nor untried, first it ap proached like this with words and showed itself of its own accord. It said, "Tell me, maiden -1 live in the dark woods and river banks and dwell in meadows refreshed by streams - what great cowardice has come upon your courage? Fruits lie scattered everywhere, each beneath its own tree the cups are springs of water. It is wicked to touch the heavenly gifts. That one thing the world lacks. What prevents you test ing reasons hidden far away? It is empty superstition. The other part of the world has been withdrawn. Why did he give eternal life? Why have the arrangements for death been withdrawn? If you think that what I said was not futile, I the author of what should be dared annul the sacred laws. You are his wife, it is right for you to</page><page sequence="6">48 SIGRID SCHOTTENIUS test his soul by pleading. I shall be your leader. If your choice of me is sure, we will heap up the couches and feast on sumptuous banquets". In this enlargement of the biblical story of the temptation of Eve, Proba's very anthropomorphic snake entices Eve to explore the "mysteries" or "hidden causes", causas penitus temptare latentes (189). In the original Vir gilian context this refers to when Aeneas insists on trying to pluck a twig from a tree to cover his altar when sacrificing during his stop in Thrace (3, 32). But the tree bleeds human blood and soon Aeneas finds out that the Trojan hero Polydorus is trapped inside. This tree, and especially the "pli ant twig", lentum vimen (3, 31) that Aeneas tries to pluck corresponds to the tree and the golden bough in book six latet arbore opaca aureus etfoliis et lento vimine ramus (6, 137). Note especially that there is really no need to have the serpent utter this rather awkward phrase, and therefore, it might not be employed primarily for its 'semantic aptness', but rather for its al lusive value. When the serpent is first introduced in the Garden of Eden, Proba tells us that God hates the snake, that it constantly changes its appearance odit et ipse pater: tot sese vertit in ora (179). In the Aen?d, these two hemistichs (from the consecutive lines 7,327-328) serve to describe Pluto's feelings towards his daughter, the fury Allecto, who constantly changes her savage appearance, her hair covered with snakes. Again, it is worth noting that in Genesis, the snake is not primarily known for its ability to change its shape. So, this par ticular line from Virgil might perhaps not principally be used for its 'se mantic aptness' in relation to the biblical model-text, but rather for its allu sive value, as Proba achieves a connection between the pagan gods of the underworld with Satan. The satanic character of the snake is further enriched later on in the cen to. Proba relates the temptation of Christ, as presented in the synoptic gospels. But instead of an anonymous diabolus, it is the snake that comes back: Tempore non alio - magnum et memorabile nomen - serpentis furiale malum meminisse necesse est. 430 ausus quin etiam - fama est obscurior annis - conpellare virum et veniendi poseer? causas. hunc ubi tendentem adversum per gramina vidit, substitit infremuitque ferox dominumque potentem saucius ac serpens adfatur voce superba: 435 "verane te facies, verus mihi nuntius adfers? qui genus? unde domo, qui nostra ad Umina tendis? fare age, quid venias: nam te dare iura loquuntur. aut quis te, iuvenum confidentissime, nostras iussit adire domus pacique inponere morem? 440</page><page sequence="7">TYPOLOGY AND THE CENTO OF PROBA 49 non equidem invideo, miror magis: accipe porro, quid dubitem et quae nunc animo sententia surgat. est domus alta: voca zephyros et labere pinnis ardua tecta petens, ausus te credere caelo, si modo quem memoras pater est, cui sidera parent". 445 olii subridens sedato pectore fatur haut vatum ignarus venturique inscius aevi: "dissimulare etiam sperasti, perfide serpens? ne dubita; nam vera vides, opta ardua pinnis astra sequi clausumque cava te condere terra. 450 quo periture ruis maioraque viribus audes? cede deo, toto proiectus corpore terrae". At this time - a great and memorable story - it is necessary to remember the fear ful evil of the snake. Indeed the snake even dared - the story is rather obscured by time - to address the man and ask the reasons for his corning. When it saw him making for him through the grass the stricken snake stayed and fiercly growled and with proud speech addressed the powerful lord: "Is your appearance true? Do you bring news to me as a true messenger? What is your birth? What home do you come from, you who make your way to our threshold? Come on now, tell me why you come. For they say you give laws. Or who, most presumptuous young man, told you to come to our home and impose the custom of peace? Of course, I do not envy, I am all the more amazed. In turn, hear what doubt and what thought now rises in my mind. There is a high home. Call the west winds and glide with wings and seek the steep roof, daring to trust yourself to heaven, if whom you recall is really your Father, whom the stars obey". Siniling with heart calm he spoke to him not unaware of the prophets and knowing of the age to come: "Did you expect to deceive me, treacherous snake? Do not doubt. For you will see the truth. Choose to follow the high stars with wings and hide yourself shut in the hollow earth. Where do you fall, doomed creature, and do you dare things greater than your strength? Yield to God, after you have thrown your whole body to the earth". Having resisted all temptation, Christ punishes the snake for his unreliabil ity: "Yield to God, after you have thrown your whole body to the earth", cede deo y toto proiectus corpore terrae (452). Karla Pollmann has called this scene a "typological correspondence within the poem": Eve can be considered a 'type' corresponding to the 'antitype'Jesus who undoes her crime by resist ing the temptation of the serpent.1 Furthermore, as noted by Clark and Hatch, Christ's verdict of the snake in the cento corresponds to God's verdict of the serpent in Genesis 3,14. And so, in this way Proba intertwines the serpent of the Old Testament with the devil of the Gospels, and a new character - based on a typological interpretation between Genesis and the 1 Pollmann, cit. 89.</page><page sequence="8">50 SIGRID SCHOTTENIUS Gospels - takes form. Through both biblical and non-biblical typological double-exposures of this sort, the character of Satan is elaborated and the biblical narrative amplified. Keeping this example in mind we now return to the Virgilian trees in the cento, and specifically to Proba's infamous retelling of the Crucifixion.1 tollitur in caelum clamor cunctique repente corripuere sacram effigiem manibusque cruentis 615 ingentem quercum decisis undique ramis constituunt spirisque ligant ingentibus ipsum, tendebantque manus pedibus per mutua nexis - triste ministerium -, sequitur quos cetera pubes, ausi omnes inmane nefas ausoque potiti. 620 The shouting rose to heaven and suddenly they all seized the holy image and with blood-stained hands they positioned a huge oak after cutting off its branches on all sides and tied him up with huge twisted bands, and they stretched out his hands and pressed his feet together, one on the other - a sad service - those whom the other young men followed, all dared a savage sin and mastered what they dared. Here the crowd seizes Christ, touching his sacred image (sacram effigiem) and with their bloody hands, they raise an enormous oak tree with its branches cut off on each side, ingentem quercum decisis undique ramis (616). Similarly to the character of the snake, at this point the symbolic attributes of the tree have been accumulating for some time throughout the cento. The Poly dorus tree and the tree with the golden bough have been alluded to and es tablished in a non-biblical typology where they correspond to the tree of knowledge in Paradise. Here Christ is crucified on a tree, thus connecting the original act of sin of human kind in Eden with the New Testament sacri fice and redemption. To add to this there are further interesting details in this scene: Jesus is tied to the oak tree with enormous coils (spirisque ligant ingentibus ipsum, 617). This phrase comes from the description of the serpents that attack Lao coon and his sons in the second book of the Aeneid (2, 217). Again, 'seman tic aptness' is not enough to justify the use of this verse here; rather it makes the reader reflect upon the crucifixion in the light of Laocoon's tragic faith and gruesome death (2, 201-224). But with the serpent's occurrence here, Proba also achieves a fulfilment of the biblical imagery of the temptation in paradise. The combination of tree and snake in the crucifixion activates a rich spectrum of biblical as well as non-biblical typology, gradually established and built upon throughout the cento. This could be regarded an element that essentially lies at the heart 1 I. Opelt, 'Der z?rnende Christus im Cento der Proba', Jahrb. Ant.
