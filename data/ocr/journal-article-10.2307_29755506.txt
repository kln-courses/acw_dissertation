<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Possible Identification of a Significant Sculpture at Isurumuniya Temple, Anuradhapura A Man and a Horse's Head It thus happened to be a mere coincidence that two papers taken up for discussion at the deliberations of the Second International Conference-Seminar on Asian Archaeology (SICSA), held in Colombo in August 1969, were directed towards eliminating a singular problem, the problem of identifying a unique but marvellous piece of sculpture of the ancient Sinhalese, ? the Isurumuniya Man and Horse's Head ?. One was our thesis which is being discussed in the following pages. The other was the scholarly paper read by Prof. J. E. van Lohuizen-de Leeuw of Netherlands. * &amp; iV Isurumuniya temple is situated about a mile to the south of the ancient city of Anuradhapura. Till recently, Isurumuniya temple premises were considered as being just adjoining the ancient Vessagiri Vih?ra. The Vessagiri and Issarasamana Vih?ras were rec? orded in the Mah?vamsa, from the time of the arrival of Thera Mahinda in the 3rd cent. B.C., as two separate shrines (Mhv, xix, 61 f.; xx, 17). The discovery of an inscription, within the precincts of (modern) Vessagiri, wherein is found the old Sinhalese form of the name of Issarasamana temple as ? Isiramana &gt;&gt;, helps to determine that the boundaries of the ancient Issarasamana Vih?ra extended into the modern Vessagiri Vih?ra (a). The discov? ery of a Br?hmi inscription from the modern Dambulla temple (Jambukolalena of the an? cient times), enables to locate the ancient Vessagiri Vih?ra at Dambulla without much dif? ficulty (2). It can now be conclusively considered that the ancient Isuramenu temple (3) of the early inscriptions and the modern Isurumuniya are the same as the Issarasamana Vih?ra (*) This is a revised version of the paper read by the author at the Second International Con? ference-Seminar on Asian Archaeology, held in Colombo in August 1969.

The sculpture of a man and a horse's head is found on the rock boulder of the modern Isurumuniya temple, below the bund of Tissa va'va (fig. 4). Along with this one, other sculptural representations are found in the living rock as well as on separate stone slabs, well blocked-out and placed into the plinth of a building adjoining the boulder. These include the elephant friezes; figures of a man and woman (mithuna; fig. 5); a likely court (celestial) scene with several attendant figures around a central figure; some pot-bellied figures looking as if holding the weight of the building above them; several other groups, so far unidentified, like the one of a pot-bellied figure of a happy genie, holding a lotus-like object in the right hand and a fruit (pomegranate) in the left (fig. 6), reminiscent of P?ncika Kuvera figures of Gandh?ra (this figure is depicted swinging on a garland borne by two bahiravas or ganas on either side); seated figures in the pose of ? royal ease ? (mah?r?jali? l?sana) wearing ornaments inside arches in shape of horse-shoe, probably formed of the mythical makara, although identification is difficult, due to the badly weathered condition of the stone (5). These seated figures (fig. 7), in miniature, resembling the larger figure in the mah?r?jalil?sana posture, remind us of an ancient device in oriental sculpture, i.e. the repetition in miniature of the appearance of the primary object (6). We quote these small replicas in mah?r?jalil?sana as examples, to show that they are part and parcel of the shrine in which the famous sculpture under review is found and not haphazard deposits at a sub? sequent period, and as such without any relation whatsoever to the main shrine (7). This will enable one to believe that all the carvings at Isurumuniya, both on separate blocks in the plinth and the living rock as well, are intended to serve a single purpose and could not be separated in a study of the identification of the sculptures found within the premises of the shrine. Until each carving is treated separately in a subsequent study let us hope that these minor observations would suffice to identify a uniformity in the treatment of the sculptures at Isurumuniya. The sculpture of the seated figure we have taken here for discussion, less than life-size, (4) The location of Isurumuniya has also been corroborated by the account given in the Rasa v?hirii, as situated in close proximity to the dam of Tiss?v?va (Rasavahini, ed. Saranatissathera, Colombo, 1901, 1899, ii, 8832). In the account of shrines built by king Dev?nampiyatissa given in the Mah?vamsa, the vih?ra Issarasamana is mentioned as the sixth in the order of description and the Vessagiri as the ninth. If the two vih?ras were situated just adjoining each other, surely they would have been listed one immediately after the other by the author of the Mah?vamsa {Mhv, xx, 17 f.). In the earlier account the two monasteries were mentioned simultaneously, as it was necessary &amp;&gt; do so in describing the pabbajj? of nobles and vaisyas (Mhv, xx, 14 f.). (5) See also S.

IVi inches from the waist to the crown of the head, lies inside a shallow, arched, unfinished cavity, the chest being almost a continuation of the vertical plane of the rock. The incomplete nature of the sculpture does not permit one to identify any ?sana (seat or throne), on which the figure is seated (this is also the case with several other seated figures at Isurumuniya, which prove the fact that the sculptures have not reached their final perfection by the hand of the sculptor (8). Hence it looks as if the figure were seated on the flattened ground of the cavity. The left leg is placed on the ground and is stretched out, but it is curved and returned at the knee, so that the left foot touches the right thigh. The left arm stretches vertically down like a pillar from the rounded shoulder and the hand is placed palm downwards on the floor. The right leg bent at the knee, is raised, the outstretched right arm resting on it. The trunk is erect but not stiff. The expression of the face, as Vincent Smith has remarked, is that of a calm and abstracted but not uncon? scious dignity. It looks as if the upper part of the body were left bare, but there appears a faint trace of an upavita (the brahmanical chord) and one or more necklaces. The folds of a thin cloth, which drapes the lower half of the body, are shown at the waist and the hem of this garment is indicated by a faint line below the knee of the raised right leg and at the ankle of the left leg placed on the ground (?). On the upper right arm is worn a bracelet (angada). The head-dress too is unfinished. But it looks as if the man were wearing a helmet on the head, which, if so, appears to be made out of metal (9). Dr S. Paranavitana on the alternative suggests that the hair may be taken as being treated in the style called jat?bh?ra, in South Indian iconography (1?). The hair or the whole headgear, as in the case of the entire sculpture, is left unfinished. Above the left shoulder is shown the back of a seat against which the figure is resting; on the right side this feature, like the hands, is lost in the background of the rock (or left unfinished). The head of the horse is seen emerging out of the rock behind the right arm of the seated figure. The snout of the animal has been damaged and has been recently restored in cement (n). The man and horse at Isurumuniya have been identified by several scholars on several occasions, each time a different opinion being advanced. Ananda Coomaraswamy thought the sculpture to be the representation of Kapila Muni of Indian Epic fame, on the grounds of the affinity of its physicial features with those famous sculptural remains at the early Pallava capital, Mah?mallapuram, in South India, where on a similar rock boulder is depicted the descent of the Ganges (12).

Attempts have been made to identify the sculpture as ? Alexander and Bucephalus ? and also as the Hindu love-god Ananga-K?ma and his horse v?hana (Devendra, op. cit., p. 30; L. T. P. Manjusri, Ceylon Observer Magazine Edition, May 4th, 1968). 124</page><page sequence="4">This view has been dismissed by several scholars. The first attempt to study the Isurumuniya sculptures of the ? Man and Horse's head ? on a more thorough scholarly manner, was made by Prof. Senerat Paranavitana. In an elaborate analysis of the sculptures and material pertaining to the subject, Prof. Paranavitana has found a case for the repre? sentation of the Vedic gods Agni and Parjanya in these two figures. Although this view has now been generally accepted, still one could see several doubtful points in Paranavi tana's thesis. It is our intention to bring to light these questionable points of argument. At the same time, it is intended to prove that the figures in the sculpture could not be identified with those of Agni and Parjanya, as Paranavitana believes, but with some other personalities. One point of importance in Paranavitana's study is that he has entirely ignored the other sculptural remains at the site, excepting the elephant reliefs. Apparently, he has not taken the other sculptures into consideration as they do not make any significant contribu? tion to the identification of the man and horse's head with Agni and Parjanya. One there? fore wonders how the remaining sculptural pieces at Isurumuniya, among which we find some gems of ancient sculptors' art of Anur?dhapura, came to be there. According to Para? navitana, some of these are purely secular themes (13). If it is so, this could be perhaps the only place in the world where Buddhist religious and secular themes and non-Buddhist (Vedic) religious themes were mingled together in the sculptors' art, possibly of the same period. History speaks of religious intolerance whenever an opposing minority is emerging amidst the more powerful majority. The Mah?vih?ra (at Anur?dhapura), never tolerated its sister institutions Abhayagiriya and Jetavana Vih?ras for welcoming unorthodox Ma h?y?na beliefs. Abhayagiriya was built upon a former Nighantha (Jaina) monastery and no vestiges of Jaina worship were found there. In India almost the greater part of the early Buddhist shrines were later appropriated by Hindus and Jainas who converted them into their own religious edifices (14). There were several occasions on which the Mah?vih?rins or the Therav?dins (in Ceylon), took the severest measures to crush the unorthodox Mah?y?na, by destroying all that was valuable to the opponents. But here at Isurumuniya (the ancient Issarasamana or Isiramana; see above), we find traces of Vedic cult worship alongside with attempts by sculptors to depict purely secular themes, as found in royal courts. It is not pertinent here to dwell at length on the other sculptural representations at Isurumuniya. Suffice it to say that the entire group of sculp? tures was meant to serve a purpose, and that they are not haphazard deposits by later (13) S. Paranavitana, ?A Bas-Relief at "Isurumunr Anuradhapura?, AAs, XIX, 1956, pp. 335-41. (14) J. Fergusson, J. Burgess, Cave Temples of India, London, 1880. 125</page><page sequence="5">renovators, as some do believe. We may subsequently see what this purpose was, that the sculptor at Isurumuniya meant to serve. Another questionable point in Paranavitana's argument is that he has relied on the authority of a tenth-century inscription of king Kassapa V (ca. 908-918 A.D.), found at Abhayagiriya at the north end of Anuradhapura (Isurumuniya is at the south end) where the phrase podon-avulu-pulund?vuluyen is found (15). Although the earlier epigraphist Wickramasingha too has given a doubtful meaning to this particular line, Paranavitana takes it to mean an invocation to the Vedic gods Par j any a and Agni on a hypothetical phonological rendering. He compares pulund? with the Sanskrit root plus of which plostr is a derivative, and which is represented in Sinhalese words like pulussana and pulutu. Para? navitana's skill in etymological analysis is here well expressed, but we cannot understand why the Vedic Plostr was invoked by a tenth-century king in Ceylon when the more common fire-god's name Agni (Sinhalese, gini or ginna; Pali, aggi) was still prevailing. Even in the Vedic tradition Plostr is an obscure god compared to Agni. On the other hand, if the sculpture under review is that of Parjanya and Agni, and if the tradition of invoking Vedic Parjanya and Plostr was maintained without any break even up to the 10th cent., those invocations could have easily been inscribed, not miles apart (at Abhayagiriya) from the famous ? Parjanya and Agni ? at Isurumuniya, but on the very rock boulder on which they were manifested or were just emerging (16). The total absence of such an invocation being engraved at Isurumuniya seems as if the invokers of Parjanya and Agni in the tenth-century Ceylon (or even earlier) were hesitant to inscribe on the rock at Isurumuniya a prayer to their favourite divinities. However if the cult of Parjanya and Agni was so prevalent in Ceylon as is assumed by Paranavitana, as to be continued from the early centuries of the Isurumuniya carvings and, at least, up to the time of king Kassapa V, in the 10th cent., by the Sinhalese royalty, surely there should have been some other references to this Vedic couple in the literary or religious records of the Sinhalese or in their sculptural representations. The attempt by Paranavitana to derive pulund? from plostr is also open to question, as he does not prove clearly that a derivative from the Vedic plostr developed as a proper noun in Sinhalese. The reader would have been grateful if a more elaborate explanation had been supplied in dem? onstrating the derivative of early Sinhalese pod on from Vedic parjanya, as an identification of pod on with p?dum is also scarcely possible. Another assumption of Paranavitana's to prove that the sculpture is that of Parjanya and Agni is the unfinished form of the figures (17). To quote him, ? the anthropomorphism of Parjanya was also less developed than that of the most Indian gods, and the word often means the rain cloud itself. The god, therefore was the spirit of the cloud and hardly had any existence outside it. The artist had deliberately attempted to emphasise this fact in (15) EZ, I, pp. 41-57; AAs, XVI, cit., p. 179. (16) AAs, XVI, cit., p. 187. (17) AAs, XVI, cit., p. 186. 126</page><page sequence="6">the manner he has carved the figure of the man ? being seated on the rock itself, the back of the throne being slightly indicated behind the left shoulder, the two hands and the left foot being left unfinished, merging into the rock, and the entire figure being in a recess and not standing out of the rock. The impression that the artist has striven to create is that the figure of the man growing out of the rock, had manifested itself in human form but has not fully divested himself of the element in which he has his being ?. ? The manner in which the horse has been shown in the sculpture is quite in keeping with the relation of Agni to Parjanya, as we gather from Indian religious literature. Pa? rjanya being rain cloud represents water, and in the Vedic and Epic literature, it is in the water that Agni (fire), particularly that form of Agni representing lightning was believed to originate. Agni Vaisv?nara conceived as a horse, was regarded as the vehicle not only of Parjanya but also of Indra. Agni being the embryo of the waters (Garbham ap?m), the horse symbolysing Agni must be in the interior of the cloud-rock and not visible. The artist therefore has shown, the horse as coming out from the bowels of the rock, the head alone having emerged. The god has manifested just enough of his form for his votaries to recognise him ? (18). Strangely enough, nowhere else in the history of art, as far as we know, sculptures were left unfinished in their crude from, as in the case of the Isurumuniya man and horse, in order to have the sculptor's idea more emphatically expressed. The earliest analogy with such a sculptural motif is the birth of LaksmI (the later Gaja Laksmi motif of Indian art), where the goddess is shown being born. If the artists of the ancient world were following a device which the sculptor at Isurumuniya seems to have adopted according to the above observations, the birth of LaksmI motif could not have been depicted in such a complete form. Again, in the representation of Aruna, the divine chari? oteer of the Sun-god (S?rya), in medieval Indian sculpture, the figure is shown as half grown, but here too not in a crude unfinished form. In the case of S?rya's charioteer, the artist was following an Indian iconographic convention (19). Incidentally, Paranavitana has completely ignored his interpretation of the ? Parjanya '? Plostr ? worship as found in the tenth-century inscription of Kassapa V. Plostr (? the consumer ?) was never considered as the embryo of the waters (garbham ap?m). To bring further weight to his view, Paranavitana says that the right side of the human figure is left unfinished. If so, how could the bracelet in the left arm be missing, since it is very usual to depict bracelets on both arms, even more on the left (it was so especially for the one having close resemblance to the figure under review; see fig. 7). It is more important here to observe that not only the man and the horse, but even the majority of the sculptures at Isurumuniya, were left unfinished for some reasons which we have to find out. ^18j AAs, XVI, cit., pp. 185 f. H. Zimmer, The Art of Indian Asia, New York, 1955, p. 53, pi. 373. 127</page><page sequence="7">In discussing other sculptural remains at Isurumuniya, Paranavitana does not mention that these too are not in their definite finished state. In the bas-relief depicting a group of figures (20), even the arched niche is left uncompleted. The throne on which the main figure is seated is not well defined, and it looks as if the figure were seated on the ground, were it not for the slightly elevated position of the unfinished seat. The hands and feet, the dress etc., of the mithuna figures (fig. 5) too, seem to have been kept without giving them a final touch. The figure sculptures found on the other blocks of stone at Isurumuniya also speak of a similar story (21). One may argue that these sculptures are all weather-worn. If so, the same argument could be applied to the sculpture of the man and horse's head. Sculptures of the same style, probably of the same period, are not wanting from other parts of Ceylon. We may cite, for example, the Buduruvagala group of colossi near Wel lav?ya (22). Here too the sculptures are not fully completed and are likely to have been abandoned before they reached final completion. (Stylistically, also the Kusthar?jagala near Weligama could be of the same repertoire). It is our view that all the reliefs at Isurumuniya belonged to a single group, and could not be treated separately, in the way that Paranavitana does. This has already been men? tioned and will also be discussed later, in our study. Paranavitana's rendering of Meghagiri from ? Meygiri ? or ? Metgiri ? may be a pos? sibility, and the shrine at Isurumuniya could have been referred to by one of these terms at a certain period in the history of Anuradhapura (23). But it does not permit us to accept what Paranavitana says in giving the ? cloud-rock ? the meaning to signify that the shrine was the site where Megha, the rain-god symbolized in the rock (giri) was invoked. It is quite common in the Anuradhapura period to associate all important Buddhist shrines with a rock (giri); this may be primarily due to the possibility of providing rock-hewn chambers for the satngha, or else to see that the shrine is placed on an elevated position. The early religious sanctuaries in India too were built in close proximity to rock-boul? ders, with rock-hewn chambers for the monks, e.g. the Udayagiri group of caves, meant for ?jivakas, in Orissa; the rock-cut monasteries in Western India, e.g. Kondane, Bedsa, Junn?r, Pitalkhora etc., near Poona, and Jun?g?rh caves at Girinagara (Girnar) in the Gujerat province. All these Indian rock-cut sanctuaries date from the very early centuries of this era, if not earlier. In South India, we may mention the Bojjanakonda caves near Sankaram, N?garjunakonda (konda means ? rock ? or ? hill ?) in the Krsn? valley. Even in the Buddha's time, Gay?sisa (the hillock at Gay?), Gijjhak?ta (one of the five rocks at R?jagaha) were famous religious sanctuaries. We may also quote several early examples from Ceylon, e.g. Vessagiri, Rangiri (Dam? bulla), Meygiri, Uttarameghagiri, Metgiri, Udumbaragiri (Dimbul?gala), S?giri, Cetiyagiri (20) AAs, XIX, cit., pp. 335 f., fig. 1. (21) Devendra, op. cit., figs. 59-67. (22) Ibid., figs. 77-82. (23) AAs, XVI, cit., pp. 181-86. 128</page><page sequence="8">(Mihintale), Sigiri, Kasubgiri (Isurumuniya), Girihanduvehera, Dakkhinagiri (in South Ceylon) (24). If we were to admit Paranavitana's theory of Meghagiri signifying the Aryan cult of the rain-god personified as a rock, we will not be in a position to determine the purport of these early shrines associated with rocks and with the name-ending giri. It is common sense to see that all these ancient sites were selected for the specific purpose of erecting a religious monument on a rock. The temple Isiramana likewise would have obtained the name ? Meghagiri ? or ? Metgiri ? (eponymous) by its association with a rock-boulder. If our observations are convincing, the identification of the Isurumuniya sculpture of a man and a horse's head with Parjanya and Agni is open to doubt. What does it then signify? The Therav?da Buddhism introduced by Mahinda Thera in the 3rd cent. B.C. had been suffused with unorthodox Mah?y?na beliefs, from the time of king Voh?rikatissa (ca. 214-236 A.D.), or even earlier. These Mah?y?na doctrines were however suppressed by the orthodox Mah?vih?rins. The growing tide of Mah?y?na in India, after the 1st and 2nd cent, of the present era, had shown its influence in Ceylon too in the centuries that fol? lowed. But Mah?y?na never had a continuous period of successful existence in the days of the Anur?dhapura kingdom. Whenever the Mah?y?nists managed to rise above the Thera v?dins, they were all the more severely crushed (25). However, there appeared several Mah?y?na Buddhist monuments in the precincts of the city of Anur?dhapura, erected when the kings' patronage was extended, the biggest being the Jetavana temple complex (26). The Isurumuniya shrine too could have been a Mah?y?na monument appropriated by the Mah?y?nists from the Therav?dins when royal patronage shifted from Therav?da to Mah?y?na in one of those struggles between the two factions recorded in the Mah?vamsa and other literary sources. A sudden shifting of royal patronage or similar disaster which put the Therav?dins on the upper scale, brought the attempts of the Mah?y?nists at construction to a standstill. It is in this half-constructed, abandoned or destroyed state that we find most of the Mah?y?na monuments in Ceylon, e.g. the Buduruvagala shrine, the N?land? Shrine etc. We have the most glaring example of the desertion of a work begun on a large scale, one to which nobody has referred, in Mihintale, to the left of the onlooker facing Ambastale. (Mihintale, (24) The practice of erecting shrines on hill? tops was prevailing even among the prehistoric tribes in South-East Asia and India (G. Coedes, The Making of South East Asia, London, 1962, p. 26). (25) C. W. Nicholas, S.

Only a few isolated spots remained untouched (e.g. Kusthar?jagala, near Weligama). This would account for the half developed nature of the Isurumuniya shrine. The sculpture of the man and horse's head seems to have been abandoned before it was given perfection. This view could be applied to all the friezes at Isurumuniya and the theory that only the man and horse's head were carved likewise to depict a Vedic symbolism seems very doubtful. As an analogy with the Isurumuniya man-and-horse relief, Paranavitana cites a much weathered sculpture of a man standing in front of a supposed horse, from Si Tep, Siam (27). The Siamese sculpture, however, could easily be identified as that of Siva and his bull-v?hana Nandi, since the animal's left horn is still visible. The figure of the man in the Siamese sculpture has no affinity at all to the Isurumuniya man (28). Whom did the sculptor of Isurumuniya represent in the relief of a man and a horse's head. We believe it was an early attempt to represent the great Mah?y?na Bodhisattva Avalokites'vara on the mount Pot?laka, his usual abode. The Mah?vamsa records how Mah?y?na and its offshoots were introduced to Ceylon from time to time since the days of king Voh?rikatissa in the 3rd cent. A.D. With the growing tide of Mah?y?nism in India and other countries like China, Cambodia-Siam and Malaysia, it was natural for Ceylon too to be touched by its waves. Several records were discovered of the visits of Mah?y?na scholars from other distant lands, to Ceylon (29). Recent researches by scholars have established that Mah?y?na cult worship was scat? tered over a wide area in ancient Ceylon and some of the supposed Therav?da centres were actually Mah?y?na appropriations. The inscription of Mahinda IV at Mihintale enu? merating different shrines on this sacred rock mentions the shrine of Nayindu (N?tha or Avalokitesvara) and that of the goddess Manin? (T?r?) (30). Several statues of Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, just the resemblance of the Isurumuniya carving, are available from other Mah?y?na countries. Two images of Kuan-yin, the Chi? nese representation of Avalokitesvara could be cited as the best examples (figs. 9, 10). These Chinese images of the Kuan-yin form of Avalokitesvara so closely resemble the Isurumu? niya sculpture that one may wonder whether they were products of the same hand. The serene look, the upright torso, the bare chest but for the necklace ornaments, the left hand kept straight on the seat, the right hand on the slightly bent-up right knee, the (27) AAs, XVI, cit., p. 175.

Representations of Avalokitesvara in the same pose are also found among Indian ex? amples (31). Although we have cited examples from outside Ceylon, analogies are not wanting in Ceylon itself. In his study of early Mah?y?na bronzes of Ceylon, A. K. Cooma raswamy has listed several representations of the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara (32). Several of these bronze images bear very striking resemblances to the Isurumuniya sculpture (figs. 11, 12). The dignified pose of royal ease, the lack of heavy ornamentation, the high head? gear (jat?mukuta), the avalokana (looking-down attitude from Pot?laka mountain), all lead one to believe that the bronze images were small replicas of the Isurumuniya unfinished carving. Coomaraswamy says: ? the meaning of Avalokitesvara the lord that looketh down has perhaps some connection with the association of Avalokitesvara with a mountain. Hiouan Tsang speaks of mount Pot?laka in southern Dekkan as the special abode of Avaloki? tesvara ? (33). Alice Getty observes that the figure of Avalokitesvara was generally placed on a hill top, which may account for his being called ? the Lord that looks down ? (34). In his earliest form he is represented with one head and two arms, and either sitting or standing. In the earliest representations of Avalokitesvara the hair is drawn up in a high usriisa (35). We reproduce here an early representation of Simhan?da Avalokitesvara, from South India, now in the Madras Museum (fig. 1) (36), belonging probably to the 8th-9th cent. A.D. In this figure from Amar?vati, in the Guntur district, one could see several conspicuous features having very close similarity to those of the figure of Isurumuniya. Apart from the mah?r?jaUl?sana pose, the head-dress with no Dhy?ni-Buddha, the lack of heavy ornamenta? tion, the knot of the waist-band, the faint trace of an armlet on the right only, it shares some other characteristics with the sculpture under review. The emblem of a supposed weapon (vajra?), has taken the place of the horse's head in the Isurumuniya sculpture. In its un? finished state, the horse's head has a very strange resemblance to the supposed vajra emblem of the South Indian figure (note that a part of the snout of the horse's head is a later addition in cement, probably from the present century). On the left side of the Simhan?da figure are two lotus buds with a full-blown lotus flower. One may even see (31) Encyclopaedia of Buddhism, II 3, pis. XXXII, XXXIII, XXXV; G. Tucci, ?

Government Museum, Madras (Sketch by the author). the traces of some features in the shape of lotus-buds which probably testify to an attempt to depict the padma (? lotus ?) above the right shoulder of the Isurumuniya figure (37). Bhattacharyya says the Simhan?da form of Avalokitesvara has no ornament but in the r?jatil?sana attitude (38). The Vajraparvata as an abode of Bodhisattvas in Mah?y?na again explains how the rock was associated with the figure of Avalokitesvara (39). A very important clue to our study is provided by Hocart, who in the early decades of this century had discovered a close parallel to the Isurumuniya man, in an unfinished sculpture at ?ndiy?gala (fig. 8). According to Hocart's observations, ? The style of an unfinished figure in a cave at ?ndiy?gala thirty miles south-west of Anur?dhapura can only be identified by the high Pallava crown as the figure is only blocked out. It represents a man in the same attitude as the man and horse at Isurumuniya ? (40). (37) J. E. van Lohuizen-de Leeuw, in her thesis discussed at the SICSA, has tried to identify these faint traces with those of feather tipped arrows. (38) B. Bhattacharyya, The Indian Buddhist Iconography, Calcutta, 1958, pp. 127 f. (39) See the Avatamsaka Sutta in the Taisho Tripitaka, X, p. 241 b. Avalokitesvara performs the varada-mudr? with his right hand when he is represented in the ?k?sagarbha {?womb of ether ?) attitude (Bhattacharyya, op. cit., p. 399). This may be kept in mind in defining the pose of the right hand in the Isurumuniya figure. Cf. also the Avalokitesvara bronzes from Ceylon and the Kuan-yin figures from China (Coomaraswamy, op. cit.). (40) CJS, II 2, 1930, pp. 77 f., pi. XLVII b. 132</page><page sequence="12">The high Pallava crown named by Hocart is actually the jat?mukuta, the attitude is mah?r?jalil?sana. The ?ndiy?gala sculpture provides the link between Isurumuniya and other sites like Buduruvagala, Kusthar?jagala etc. (as well as the early bronze images of Ava? lokitesvara from Ceylon). All these sites are rock-hewn and meant for Mah?y?na cult images. The ?ndiy?gala shrine too is unfinished, probably owing to the same fate that had befallen most Mah?y?na monuments in Ceylon, but not a sculptural device to sym? bolize a vedic concept (sic) (41). All this would suffice to explain the possible identification of the Isurumuniya figure with that of Avalokitesvara on the mount Pot?laka. This identification would however be insufficient if the horse's head is left unexplained. It is the horse's head that had baffled several scholars in their attempts to identify the Isurumuniya sculpture. The horse is not an uncommon theme in Buddhist iconography. In the early Bh?rhut and S?ncI bas-reliefs we get the horse-headed Yaksi (Assamukhl). Later when the Buddha story came to be depicted in sculptural art, the horse as Prince Siddhartha's stallion was very often depicted in sculpture. In the Asoka pillar sculptures, in the early bas-reliefs of the Cakravartin motif, in the ancient moon-stone carvings (from Ceylon), it is not hard to find the figure of the horse. But here at Isurumuniya, it is not the horse, but the horse's head, that is carved out of the living rock. True, the sculpture is not in its finished state, but still its physical features make it clear that it is a horse's head. Avalokitesvara himself is at times identified as a divine horse (42), in Mah?y?na leg? ends (43). The C?luvamsa records the erection of a beautiful statue of a horse by king Mog gall?na I (ca. 495-512 A.D.; Mhv, 39, vv. 52 f.), in whose reign the Mah?y?na cult of Dipan kara as well as the Hair-relic worship were introduced into Ceylon, at the instigation of the king's sword-bearer Sil?k?la. Although no such image of a horse is traceable now, it is noteworthy that the pre-eminent place was given to an image of a horse by a Sinhala king in whose reign Mah?y?na gradually gained ground until it was firmly established in the succeeding reign of Sil?k?la (ca. 522-535 A.D.). It was in the reign of Sil?k?la, that the Mah?y?na text Dhammadhatu was introduced to Ceylon and diplomatic ties with the Chi? nese Empire (a region where Mah?y?na Buddhism was widespread), were maintained (44). It is also significant to note that the probable date of the Isurumuniya sculpture as well as the early lithic and bronze representations of Avalokitesvara from Ceylon, fall very close to the period of Sil?k?la. It may be surmised that the centuries immediately preced (41) Among early forms of Avalokitesvara, prominence was given to a special form from Ceylon, known as Sinhaladvipe ?rogyas?l?-Lokan? tha (A. Foucher, L'iconographie bouddhique de Finde, Paris, 1900-1905, catalogue, I, 20). Probably, this form of Avalokitesvara has been taken as an ideal by the Mah?y?nists of other countries. (42) S. Beal, Chinese Accounts of India, Indian ed., IV, Calcutta, 1958, p. 439, note 14; p. 441. (43) See also E. Chavannes, Cinq cents contes et apologues ex traits du Tripitaka chinois, I, Paris, 1910, pp. 224-26. (44) Nicholas, Paranavitana, op. cit., pp. 130 ?.; University History of Ceylon, cit., I 1, pp. 380 f. 133</page><page sequence="13">ing and following Sil?k?la's reign saw the emergence of Mah?y?na in Ceylon over orthodox Mah?vih?ra. The image of a horse erected by Sil?k?la could never have been that of Avalokitesvara, as the Bodhisattva is found represented in human form in Ceylon bronzes and stone images. But we can imagine that the position par excellence, enjoyed by the horse in Mah?y?na, as Avalokitesvara's constant companion, could possibly have resulted in the rendering of the horse in the sculpture of Mah?y?nists. This is the famous Hayagriva, the horse-headed divinity that always keeps in close proximity to the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara (we may even identify the supposed image of a horse erected by Moggall?na I, as that of Hayagriva). It is also tempting to point out the hesitant remark by W. Geiger on the variant reading in another recension of the Mah?vamsa, which gives ? Dlpankarassa N? thassa ? instead of ? Dipahkarassa Nagarassa ? (45). Dipankara Buddha was always repre? sented along with his two acolytes, a Bodhisattva on either side (46). If this variant read? ing is accepted as correct, we may conjecture that this passage of the Mah?vamsa could be taken as a reference to a representation of the image of Dipankara Buddha with the accom? panying Bodhisattva N?tha (Avalokitesvara, the Nayindu of ancient Ceylon; see above). If our conjecture is not untenable, we may further suggest that the shrine where these images of Dipankara Buddha and his acolytes (the Bodhisattva N?tha and the image of the horse) were installed, could possibly be sited at the present Isurumuniya temple, thus making more avenue for the possible identification of the Isurumuniya man and horse with Avalokitesvara and his acolyte Hayagriva. R. H. van Gulik says: ? Hayagriva seems to have been invoked for numerous purposes, such as causing rain, vanquishing enemies, driving away devils, kindling love between two people, curing diseases and so on. Hayagriva, the horse in Northern Buddhism plays a great part on account of its connection with Avalokitesvara ? (47). It is not impossible to believe that the cult of Hayagriva too had prevailed among the early Mah?y?nists of Ceylon alongside with the cult of Avalokitesvara. The sculptor at Isurumuniya could not have hesitated to symbolize this great divine companion of Avalo? kitesvara in his very natural form, that is, with a horse's head. Hayagriva may generally mean ? a horse's neck ?. But no one can distinguish a neck of a horse in sculpture unless the entire head is shown. Thus Hayagriva came to be depicted as the divinity with the head of a horse in Mah?y?na sculpture (48). We may conclude our identification of the Isurumuniya man and horse as an attempt to depict the great Mah?y?na Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara and his satellite Hayagriva (49).

E. van Lohuizen-de Leeuw, Indian Sculptures in the von der Heydt Collection, Z?rich, 1964, p. 54. (49) One may still argue that the S?dhanam?l? or similar Mah?y?na texts on iconography do not permit to represent Hayagriva on the right side of Avalokitesvara. To such arguments, we have to say that these texts were not composed before the sculptures, but after studying very often the sculptures, as they existed in the time of the authors of these treatises. Hence, we cannot cite 134</page><page sequence="14">Furthermore, our view on the Isurumuniya shrine as an early centre of Mah?y?na worship in Ceylon is further corroborated by the identification of another bas-relief at Isurumuniya by a reputed scholar, P. C. Sestieri. Sestieri believes that the so-called lovers (fig. 5), the mithuna couple, at Isurumuniya represents Sthiracakra and his Sakti (50). Hopes of arriving at a closer possibility by our attempt to identify this remarkable piece of sculpture, were for a moment made futile by the researches of Prof. J.E. van Lohuizen de Leeuw. She has found a very close similarity to the Isurumuniya sculpture under review, in a South Indian sculpture discovered at a ruined site at Alampur on the Tungabhadra river in the Raichur district in Southern Deccan. To quote her, ? it is obvious that it represents the same personage as our so-called 'Kapila". Both legs are folded in precisely the same distinctive manner, the left lying flat on the ground, the right drawn up while it supports the right extended arm, exactly as in the "Isurumuni" relief. The curly hair is blown out in locks and over the left shoulder a horse is peering, which has the same peculiar elongated triangle near the eye. The only difference between both sculptures is the fact that the horse's head is depicted to the right of the seated male figure instead of to the left (51) ?. The Alampur figure of a man and horse has generally been referred to as that of God Aiyan?r or S?ttan (52). Whatever the case may be our gratefulness is due to Prof. Lohuizen, whose penetrat? ing eye has seen a very close resemblance to the Isurumuniya man and horse in the South Indian friezes of Aiyan?r. Apparently this resemblance and a possible relationship with the Aiyan?r cult prevailing in Ceylon up to the modern times, make the arguments of the learned Professor more tenable and the identification more feasible. But a deeper study into the cult of Aiyan?r both in India and Ceylon will help to glean some historical facts that would further strengthen our thesis in identifying the Isurumuniya sculpture as that of the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara and Hayagriva. To strengthen her case for the identification of the Isurumuniya sculpture with Aiyan?r, van Lohuizen has sought the help of several other sculptural representations of the Dravidian god Aiyan?r from various South Indian sites. These other sculptures too have certain characteristic similarities but are not so identical with the sculpture at Alam? pur. These are of a relatively later date, probably after the period of the Cola dynastic rule. The other sites are Ecalam in South Arcot district, Tiruppat?r, Kannapuram, K?ncipuram, Tirukkutunkuli, D?r?suram and a late eighteenth-century bronze figure from Trivandum. Aiyan?r was a divinity of the lower castes, S?dras, until a very late date (and that too texts like the S?danam?l?, etc., of very late date, in determining the purport of sculptures that had preceded these texts by several centuries. (50) P. C. Sestieri, ?The "Lovers" of Issurumuniya and Their Possible Identification ?, EW, X, 1959, pp. 94-96. (51) Text of Prof, van Lohuizen-de Leeuw'^ paper covering foot-notes 51 and 52.

According to the suggestions by van Lohuizen, we have to admit that Tamil influence obtained through political activities in the Anur?dhapura period led to the introduction of the Aiyan?r cult in Ceylon (54). This will make one to believe that none of the powerful Tamil principalities in South India, that caused to influence Ceylon politics and in turn religion etc., were penetrated with the normal devotion to the more popular Hindu gods, but were rather observers of a proto-Dravidian village cult, alien to the orthodox Hinduism. Again we have to wonder whether a majority of those Tamils who influenced Ceylon were S?dras and the like, who worshipped a gr?madevat?. On the other hand, if at all Tamil influence was predominant in Ceylon, religiously or otherwise, it had come naturally from the ruling classes in South India, with whom the Anur?dhapura kingdom had had relations, both cordial and hostile; therefore the possibility of a gr?madevat? (Aiyan?r) being introduced to Ceylon and worshipped by the population of the Anur?dhapura kingdom, is very unlikely. More so that the Anur?dhapura kingdom was powerful enough to check the tides of South Indian influences. If not for stray and sudden raids by upstarts none of the so called powerful dynasties in South India (except the Colas) had dared to clash with the Sinhalese kingdom of Anur?dhapura. Even the powerful Colas came initially not to invade Ceylon but to negotiate to obtain the lost regalia of the Pandyan king and a court intrigue at Anur?dhapura had helped them to gain initial success. On the ground of the above historical facts, it is somewhat difficult to admit that a South Indian village-folk cult contrary to the widespread religious beliefs of the masses, was accepted and kept unchallanged, as in the case of the supposed cult of Aiyan?r (55). On the part of religion, as we have pointed out earlier, the Buddhist rulers of Anu? r?dhapura never tolerated any sort of infiltration that would have disturbed the accepted orthodoxy. Even Mah?y?na, an off-shot of Therav?da Buddhism, was severely crushed on several occasions. Had Aiyan?r been given such a significant position as to be sculptured on the embankment near the great reservoir Tiss?v?va, for the specific purpose of estab? lishing a cult worship, that alone would indicate the outstanding position given to the (53) Ibid., text covering foot-notes 75 and 76. (54) Ibid., text covering foot-notes 89-91. If Tamil influence had resulted in a gr?madevat? (Aiyan?r) being given a prominent place among the early Sinhala people, the more important gods like Siva and Visnu would have gained a place far more superior, on the same analogy. But the absence of such a popular acceptance of Hinduism among the early Sinhalese, makes van Lohuizen's possible identification of the Isurumuniya figure with Aiyan?r very untenable. (55) The recent researches into certain interlinear inscriptions (discovered in Ceylon), that are being carried out by Prof. Senerat Paranavitana, have shown that the sources of political and religious influences on early Ceylon are to be found in a different field, that is South-East Asia (and especially Malaysia). Once completed, Prof. Paranavitana's researches, will lead us to fully evaluate the so-called extraneous influences, especially religious and cultural, on Ceylon's history on a completely different line (see S. Paranavitana, Ceylon and Malaysia, Colombo, 1966; Id., ? Newly Discovered Historical Documents Relating to Ceylon, India and South East Asia?, Buddhist Yearly, Halle, 1967, pp. 26-58). 136</page><page sequence="16">divinity. If so, he would have been given the same position in other principalities of the country. But for the introduction of the so-called ? Aiyn?yaka ? cult in the late centuries after the mediaeval period, we do not come across any reference to the cult of Aiyan?r (as prevailing in Ceylon), in any source, literary or otherwise. Aiyan?r was not a Hindu god originally. This was pointed out by van Lohuizen-de Leeuw, too. An analysis of the development of the Aiyan?r cult in South India, would reveal that it has been, possibly, appropriated by the later Hindus into their fold from an outside source. Divinities taken later into the Hindu pantheon from popular cults (or proto-Dravidian cults) in India were never regarded as lesser beings by the Hindu worshipper. This is ex? plicit in the cult of Krsna-V?sudeva, Murugan-K?rtikeya and several other divinities supposed to have been borrowed from local, village, popular cults. The cult of Aiyan?r was however absorbed by later Hinduism, but never given a position equivalent to a god of the normal Hindu pantheon. This seems to be a strange phenomenon unless logical reasoning is found to explain the strange behaviour of Hindus towards Aiyan?r. We would like to suggest that Aiyan?r was a Buddhist divinity worshipped in South India as a different personality before he was absorbed into the Hindu pantheon; never? theless, the antipathy against Buddhist cults was continued further, even after the absorp? tion of these cults into official Hinduism. Buddhism was prevailing in South India, and one could believe that it was a prominent religious factor at certain stages in the early centuries of South Indian history (56). Various early sites like Uraiyur and N?gapattinam, bear evidence of the existence of Buddhism in the southernmost part of India from a very early period, say about the early centuries of the Christian era (57). The great S?tav?hana-?ndhra dynasty which was the deciding factor of political, cul? tural and religious activities in the whole of South India (south of Deccan) during the first few centuries of the Christian era, had been a Buddhist power right throughout. ?ndhras were the source of inspiration to most, if not all, of the later rulers of South India. Ceylon too had relationships with South Indian Buddhist centres. The Mah?vamsa speaks of Thera Sanghamitta, from K?veripattinam in the Cola country (in South India), who had made a lasting influence on Mah?y?na Buddhism in Ceylon {Mhv, xxxvi, vv. 12 f.; xxxvii, vv. 1-30). Thus we see that South India and Ceylon had common grounds of cul (56) Although no large scale research is done in regard to the history of Buddhism in South India, the available data suggest that Buddhism was prevailing in the Tamil country at a very early date, and it would have possibly been introduced even before the arrival of official Hinduism. The gnomic and didactic material in several so-called Sangam period works, indicates that Buddhism had been a deciding factor in regard to the philosophy of the early Tamil poets. (57) P. R. Srinivasan, Bronzes of South India {Bulletin of the Madras Government Museum), Madras, 1963, pp. 350 f.; p. 107, fig. 58; p. 165, fig. 101; pp. 166-69, figs. 102-3; p. 233; p. 83, fig. 49; C.

From this point of view, it is not difficult to see religious art being liberally exchanged and absorbed by the two regions that are separated by only a narrow stretch of water (but the fact that the history of South Indian art centres does not have such a distant origin as that of Anur?dhapura, has also to be maintained here). The supposed figure of Aiyan?r (from Ecalam), which was the prototype of later cult images of Aiyan?r in South India, could thus be considered as none other than the sculp? ture of a Buddhist divinity, that has been sculptured in that period when Buddhism was a faith of the people of South India amongst other religious beliefs. The probable date (by about the 7th or the 8th cent., at the latest) that could be given to the two sculptures from Anur?dhapura and Ecalam, suggests thai the provenance of this particular religious theme is Ceylon, as Ceylon was the source of Buddhism to most of the South Asiatic coun? tries in those periods. We would however like to suggest that the Ecalam figure was a later attempt by a South Indian sculptor to depict a divinity (either Buddhist or non-Buddhist), under the influence of the great centre of religious art that was Anur?dhapura, which had an un? broken tradition of Buddhist art from the pre-Christian centuries up to the 9th, 10th cent. A.D. Several sculptural pieces of Cola art produced after the dynasty's imperial expansion, show clear signs of Sinhalese influence. This was quite possible since, after their successful conquest of Ceylon, Colas could also taken the artists from Ceylon along with the other booty and at the same time it is also possible that, with the fall of the Sinhalese royal Fig. 2 - Siva and Nandi. From South India. 10th-llth cent. A.D. (Sketch by the author). 138</page><page sequence="18">house, the artists of Ceylon had sought both refuge and patronage in the court of their new imperial master in South India, as did the Achaemenid artists in the court of the Imperial Mauryas (58). Fortunately we have discovered a later Cola attempt to depict their great divine being, the Mahesvara-Siva with his bu\i~v?hana Nandi, in a pose very much akin to the Isurumuniya sculpture of a man and horse. Although lacking both the elegance and refinedness of the Isurumuniya sculpture, still we see here (fig. 2), an attempt by the Saivite sculptor to borrow and transmute an ideal for the icon of his great divine being. The depiction of their great (or greatest) divine-being in this peculiar manner, with the vahana shown above the right shoulder, however, does not seem to have appealed much to the Saivite Hindus of South India. Hence the absence of such a depiction of Siva-Nandl else? where in the whole of India (59). The date of this sculpture could easily be fixed in or after the 10th-11th cent, on the ground of the analogy of other sculptures, having similar fea? tures, of lesser divinities from the Cola country (?0). Our argument for the case of a Buddhist divinity from Ecalam, could further be streng? thened by the observations of the reputed Indian scholar T. A. Gopinatha Rao, who had analysed several South Indian figures of Aiyan?r and the cult relating to this divinity. Gopinatha Rao too believes that Aiyan?r could possibly have been originally a Buddhist divinity. To quote Rao, ? That this is a deity peculiarly Dravidian and has been taken into the fold of the Aryan pantheon at a later period goes without contradiction. At present Hariharaputra is treated in the Tamil country as a village deity and is mostly worshipped by the lower classes and the p?j? in the temple of Hariharaputra or Ayyan?r (or Ayyan?rap pan) is performed by a S?dra ? (61). He further says: ? This deity is called S?sta because he is able to control and rule over the whole world; etymologically therefore, the word means a ruler of a country, and is sometimes applied to teachers and fathers. The Ama rak?sa applies the name to Buddha also. The Tamil Nighantus call him by the additional names S?tav?hana, the rider of the white elephant, K?ri, the wielder of the weapon known as sendu, the consort of P?ran? and Pushkal?, the protector of Dharma and Yogi; they also state that the vehicle of S?sta is the elephant and the crest of his banner a cock. The names, rider of the white elephant, Yogi, the protector of Dharma coupled with the signi? ficance of Buddha applied to S?sta in the Amarak?sa incline one to conclude that Buddha as conceived and worshipped in the Tamil country was ultimately included in the Hindu pantheon and a Pur?nic story invented for his origin at a later period of the history of Hindu Iconology. The name S?tav?hana is also very noteworthy as it has been assumed by a dynasty of powerful kings of the earlier centuries of the Christian era ? (62).

These appellations of Aiyan?r, namely, S?sta, Dharma, Yogi, S?tav?hana could not be lightly taken, as they too do signify a certain phenomenon in the historical development of the personality of this supposed gr?madevat? of the Dravidians. S?sta, as pointed out by Rao too, is very much equal to the epithet of the Buddha as Satth? (Pali; Sanskrit, S?st?; cf. Digha-Nik?ya, 1. 49, 163; Suttanip?ta, 153, 343); Dharma has its equivalent in another epithet of the Buddha, that is Dharmar?ja (? ruler of the norm ?). Even the very name Aiyan?r seems to have a non-Dravidian phonetic origin. We have elsewhere stated that Avalokitesvara in Ceylon was referred to by the name Nayindu (N?thendra). ?rya is also a term often used to qualify names of Mah?y?na Bodhisattvas and more so that of Avalokitesvara (63). The possibility of a derivation from the com? posite term ? ?rya-^N?tha ?, could be suggested in order to explain the origin of this non Tamil name Aiyan?r. If our surmise is acceptable, ? Aiyanar ? could well be taken as a Dravidian phonetic formation of ? ?rya-N? ? which is equivalent to ?ryan?tha, ?ryan? thesvara, or ?ry?valokitesvara. The other epithet, S?tav?hana (? he whose mount is an elephant ?), also refers to a derivative from the throne name of the famous ?ndhra-S?tav?hana Buddhist dynasty, who were more frequently referred to as S?tav?hanas (S?liv?hanas) (64). Our study could further (63) Mudiyanse, op. cit., pp. 28, 51, 58 f.; Getty, op. cit., pp. 64-66.

This would not be strange, if we take this piece of bas-relief from Amar?vati as the prototype of the later Bodhisattva figures of the Mah?y?nists.

Among these the icons of the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara are the more common (65). Other minor items referred to by Prof, van Lohuizen are, the flat seat of Aiyan?r and the hotst-v?hana. The stylized lotus seat (padm?sana) of Avalokitesvara was preceded, as seen in several cases, by an earlier flat seat. This is found in the icons of the Bodhisattva made of both stone and metal (fig. 12) (66). In most of the images quoted by van Lohuizen, the identification with the Isurumuniya figure is made possible through the supposed similarity of the hair-style, referred to by her as jat?bh?ra and made familiar by such oft-quoted phrases as, for example, ? Once more his wild-hair arranged in a peak is noticeable ?, ? The wild hair [...] is particularly notice? able ?, ? The wild hair is again noticeable ?. We would like to suggest that this peculiar hair-style, made familiar to us by van Lohuizen as ? wild hair ?, could probably be a later development in South Indian Aiyan?r icons, since the absorption of Aiyan?r into the Hindu pantheon as a gr?madevat?. A close study of the Isurumuniya figures however shows that the hair-style of the Sinhalese sculpture is quite different from the ? wild hair ?. Even in its unfinished state, the head-gear of the Isurumuniya figure shows an attempt to depict not wild hair, but a well combed, elegantly arranged hair-style. Van Lohuizen has not specifically dwelt on the hotst-v?hana of Aiyan?r other than by referring to innumerable icons of horses in temple premises supposed to have been dedic? ated to Aiyan?r. The earlier texts refer to Aiyan?r's v?hana as an elephant and it is on this vehicle that the god is very often depicted by later sculptors (67). The prevalence of the cult of Aiyan?yaka in Ceylon, especially in the North-Central Province and the Hill-Country, would however be a strong factor for the case of the Hindu Aiyan?r cult in Ceylon. The god Aiyan?yaka in Ceylon has almost all the characteristics of the so-called Hindu Aiyan?r. But it has no such antiquity in Ceylon as in South India, as far as we know. The worship of this god is also widespread among the Tamil plantation community in Ceylon, who are the descendants of the low-caste South Indian labourers brought down to Ceylon in the middle of the last century. The same process that took place in South India in introducing an original Buddhist god (or Bodhisattva) concept ? ?rya, S?sta, S?tav?hana ? into the Hindu pantheon, had ton, J. Irwin, B. Gray, The Art of India and Pakistan, London, 1950, pi. 16, fig. 69; J. Fer? gus son, Tree and Serpent Worship, 2nd ed., London, 1873, pi. LIX; J.

This clearly appears from the analysis of the characteristics of Buddhist syncretic gods of Ceylon (68), in the post-mediaeval cen? turies: Aiyan?yaka is also one of them. In conclusion we may say that the South Indian Aiyan?r cult was a development (through assimilation) of a very early Buddhist cult, probably that of Avaloki tesvara. The so-called Ecalam sculpture (69) of a man and a horse could thus be an attempt to reproduce the cult image of this powerful Bodhisattva, as it was represented in Ceylon and India, both in stone and metal carvings. The gradual decay of Mah?y?na Bodhisattva worship in these parts of the Buddhist world, due to the vigilant checks of Therav?dins in Ceylon and the advent of Hinduism in South India, paved the way for later popular syncretic cults like that of Aiyan?r in South India (among the Hindus), and the god Saman and other later Buddhist god concepts in Ceylon. We may rest assured for the time being that our study had proved helpful to bridge the gap between the Buddhist Avalokitesvara and the Hindu Aiyan?r, and that the possible identification of the Isurumuniya man and horse carving with the Bodhisattva Avaloki? tesvara and his companion Hayagriva may still be kept as valid. It is not possible for us to discuss all the sculptural remains at Isurumuniya in this paper, still we could surmise, that they all belonged to a single individual shrine of Mah?y?na Buddhists, which had come to be known by the name of ? Isuramenu - Bo - Upulvan - Kasubgiri - Radmahavehera ? (70). This shrine complex had come into existence (68) Some characteristics of the Hlnduized Aiyan?r are very glaringly seen in the God Saman of Ceylon. Saman is a syncretic Buddhist divinity whose origin could be easily found in the concept of the N?tha-Avalokitesvara cult in Ceylon (S. Parana Vitana, The God of Adam's Peak, Ascona, 1958, frontispiece, shows God Saman with his elephant-v?hana; the ? wild hair? too is not absent. He carries the weapons, bow and arrow. See also ibid., 41, fig. 4; the same god with his elephant- v?hana). (69) The Ecalam figure agrees well with the rules of iconology, in depicting the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara and his satellite Hayagriva, as recommended in such later texts as the S?dhanam?l?. (70) In the term ?Bo-Upulvan? a faint reference to the Bodhisattva Uppalavanna might be seen (the god Upulvan who appeared in the Vijaya legend of the Mah?vamsa: see Mhv, transl. Geiger, vii, v. 5, note 2). Geiger believes that Upulvan is Visnu, since he is endowed with the colour of the blue lotus. But upul (? lotus ?) is not always blue; there are red and white lotuses too. Hence we cannot deduce that Upulvan is Visnu by the possible identification of Visnu's colour with the blue lotus. We would like to identify Upulvan with Padmap?ni, a form of the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara (Getty, op. cit., pp. 58 ff.). ? Upulvan? need not necessarily be taken as the colour of a lotus. S. Paranavitana. however, interprets the term as ? Utpala-Varuna ? an aspec; of the Vedic god Varuna ( Paranavitana, The God of Adam's Peak, cit., pp. 24 ff.; Id., The Shri? ne of Upulvan, cit.). By the time of compilation of the Mahavamsa, that is, in the 5th cent. A. D., Mah?y?nism was well established both in Ceylon and India and the usage of various epithets of Mah?y?na Bodhisattvas in Ceylon is not at all impossible. Hence we would like to suggest that ? Upulvan ? might also be a reference to the god bearing a lotus flower, Padmap?ni, as -van could also give the meaning of ? one who is possessing ?. Hence ?Upulvan? could give ? one who is bearing a lotus ?, that is, Padmap?ni (Avalo? kitesvara). If our surmise is acceptable, the term ?Bo-Upulvan? in the above context could be taken as a reference to the shrine orginally named Isuramenu, and later referred to with other qualifications like ? Kasubgiri ? and ? Bo-Upulvan ?. But the Therav?da bias of the Mahavamsa author, had led him to give a new twist to the meaning of Bo-Upulvan. This factor would strengthen 142</page><page sequence="24">in a more favourable period of Mah?y?nism in Ceylon, and flourished until it was aban? doned or left unfinished owing to an unexpected shift of royal patronage. The lack of suf? ficient documentation does not yet warrant an attempt to describe in full all the various aspects of Mah?y?na cult worship in Ceylon, but this paper, we believe, might at least provide an avenue for future research on the circumstances in which unorthodox cult worship of the Mah?y?nists arose, developed and declined at certain individual sites like Isurumuniya. A.D.T.E. Perera (although the argument can hardly be anything other than speculative) the location of a shrine dedicated to the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara, who is also referred to as Padmap?ni (Upulvan), within the premises of the Isuramenu temple. The shrine Bo-Upulvan - Kasubgiri, within the premises of the ancient Issarasamana Vih?ra, was accepted by the bhikkhus of the thera (orthodox) school with initial reluctance, but the vih?ra of the same name at Sigiriya, donated by the same parricide king Kassapa I, was accepted without any ado by the bhikkhus of the Dhammaruci fraternity (see Mhv, 39, vv. 10-15). This would indicate that the shrine by the name of Bo-Upulvan - Kasubgiri was appealing to the Mah?y?nists bhikkhus more than to the orthodox Therav?dins, and the stigma of being a parricide, borne by its builder, was not an issue for the Mah?y?nists. Here too one could see a contrivance by the Mah?vamsa author to conceal a fact that proved to be unpalatable for the Therav?dins of the Mah?vih?ra ? the fact of being a Mahay ana monument. 143</page></plain_text>
