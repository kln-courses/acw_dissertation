These have entered the arboreal pan- theon due not only to Peattie's lyrical prose and learned and wide-ranging discussions but also to Paul Landacre's (1893- 1963) elegant etchings. The two originals compris- ing 1390 pages have now been combined into a 511-page con- densation: A natural history of North American trees (2007). Gardening editor Frances Tenenbaum remarked (p. xix). "I am thrilled to present a com- bination of the two volumes. Some of the more unwieldy descriptions and minor trees have been trimmed, leaving only the gems of Peattie's best observations .... Peattie's writing remains largely untouched; the original language has not been corrected or updated. . . . We have also retained from the original books the stunning illustrations by Paul Landacre. These fine etchings were made using a technique know as scratchboard ..." These rather benign comments belie the severe expurgation of the esteemed originals. Ronald M. Lanner nailed it in his 27 May 2008 review in Amazon: 1* out of 5*: "Bits and pieces of a classic does not equal a classic": Donald Culross Peattie's two volumes on the natural his- tory of American trees have been rightfully regarded as classic books on their subject for the half-century since they appeared. Peattie's sparkling prose, combined with his scientific under- standing and Paul Landacre's elegant woodcuts, remain un- equaled in popular American nature writing. This great work deserves to be available to the public. But what do we get? We get crumbs. Instead of the origi- nal 1357 pages of the combined works, this little summary gives us 512 pages, or 38%. Species in droves are arbitrarily thrown out - as one example, instead of the original 32 pines this skimpy screed allows just 9. Nine pines to represent the great North American pinetum! Dendrological disaster. Much better for the tree-obsessed reader to seek out the original volumes in used-book stores rather than settle for this insult to the author and the trees he loved so well. According to Wikipedia, the 2007 reissue "contains 1 12 of the original 257 essays [44%] and 135 of the original 365 illustrations [37%]. It won the National Outdoor Book Award (Outdoor Classics, 2007)." The 112 essays include 35 on gymnosperms, 2 on mono-, and 75 on dicotyledons. Lanner and I are partial to conifers, but it is worth noting that other groups got worse culling. The salicologist will lament the reduction of 14 western and 7 eastern-central species of Salix to just two in the latter region: S. nigra and S. discolor. I noticed the wind taken out of the willows because for some unfathomable reason they are plunked in the midst of the conifers, being sandwiched between 1146</page><page sequence="2">TAXON 61 (5) • October 2012: 1143-1156 Schmid • Reviews and notices the sequoias-pines-spruces (2-9-5 species) and the firs-junipers- larches-hemlocks (6-4-2-2). One would think the axing of the co- nifers now finished (pp. 1-158 except the salicine pp. 102-106), but some five dozen pages later there is betwixt the oaks (6) and elms (3) a compensatory but equally incomprehensible plunk (pp. 222-245) of the cedars (4 species) and the discordant Monterey cypress (Cu- pressus macrocarpa, now Hesperocyparis macrocarpa). I love oaks nearly as much as conifers; hence I sadly note the chopping of Quercus from 18 western and 18 eastern-central species to just six (the western Chrysolepis, née Castanopsis, and Notholithocarpus, née Lithocarpus, are totally ignored). This sequencing of tree groups is certainly weird, but Tenen- baum's strange arboretum (I resist the obvious pun) continues, to wit: poplars (4 species), desert palm (1), hawthorns (2 only, down from 18, thank goodness), joshua tree (1), and cherry (1). The two xerophytic monocotyledons are well separated from their desert dicotyledonous mates, which, however, are interdigitated with me- sic groups. This cockeyed sequencing of taxonomie groups is Tenen- baum's, because Peattie had the traditional and logical sequence of conifers, monocotyledons (in the West only), and dicotyledons. For the of gymnospermous completeness, and to reveal further Te- nenbaum's blundering and plundering I provide sequential statistics from Peattie's treatments of conifers (N/N+N = numbers of spe- cies in 2007/1953+1950 works): sequoias (2/2+0), pines (9/23+9), larches (2/3+1), spruces (5/6+3), hemlocks (2/2+2), Douglas firs (1/2+0), firs (5/8+2), cedars (2/2+ 1), true cypresses (1/10+0), false cypresses (2/2+ 1), junipers (4/8+2), yews (0/1 +0), torreyas (0/1 +0) = total 35/70+21 conifers [also palms (1/1+0), yuccas (1/1+0) = total (2/2 + 0) monocotyledons ]. Also axed from the originals are the color endpaper maps, the useful generic descriptions preceding the species accounts, and the keys to species and genera. The update has new footnotes by the editor ("Editor's note:"). I counted 38, 35 for nomenclatural updates: Some are necessary, as Sequoiadendron giganteum for the former Sequoia gigantea or Pseudotsuga menziesii for the erstwhile P. taxifolia, but those involving just authorities are superfluous, as "Formerly Sequoia sempervirens (Lambert) Endlicher" for "Se- quoia sempervirens (Lambert ex D. Don) Endlicher." Only three footnotes are non-nomenclatural: one for the Save-the-Redwoods League (p. 25), one helpfully explaining a pejorative lumbermen's term (p. 115), and one noting that Maclura is not monotypic (p. 385). This condensation can not be recommended due to its shortage and other shortcomings. The book is a good example of the prob- lems that can arise when a horticulturist rather than a knowledge- able dendrologist, forester, botanist, or taxonomist edits a reissue of a floristic work. An additional insult with this reissue is that Paul Landacre's striking B&amp;W illustrations are poorly reproduced; many appear overly dark with blocked highlights. The illustrations in the original edition are much superior, probably because they are reproduced on finer textured paper. This reissue naturally has some value. There is not only a new four-page biographical foreword by Peattie's son, noted historian Mark R. Peattie (born 1930) but also a new four-page introduction by writer Verlyn Klinkenberg. The former describes his father's field outfit (p. xi): "a dark green Stetson on his head, a coat and Donald Culross Peattie (1898-1964) tie - he never went anywhere outside without them" (see photo). Moreover, the examples of nature writing selected are superb. For instance, page 1 begins: The kingdom of the plants has a king, the Giant Sequoia or California Bigtree. It is, as a race, the oldest and mightiest of living things. Not even in past geologic times, apparently, were there greater trees than Sequoiadendron giganteum. Only the Bigtree's closest of kin, the Redwood of the California coast, approaches it in longevity and girth. In grace and height, indeed, the Coast Redwood, Sequoia sempervirens. is a queen among trees, a fit mate for the craggier grandeur of the Bigtree of the Sierra Nevada. [This editor's note: Pinus longaeva - banished from the reissue - has greater longevity.] Admittedly this type of poetic and anthropomorphic nature writing may have limited appeal nowadays. Finally, Lanner's and my snarkiness about the vanishing of so much of Peattie's prose and other problems would have been greatly tempered had A natural history of North American trees been given a nomenclatural update and appropriately subtitled, perhaps as Selections from the nature writings of Donald Culross Peattie (1898-1964).</page></plain_text>
