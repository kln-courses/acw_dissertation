This body is anatomically and physiologically very uniform and the manner in which human beings name and categorize its various aspects demon- strates the inherent and observable unities and discontinuities it possesses. For these reasons ethnoanatomical systems promise to be an attractive domain for cross-cultural comparison.2 In addition, the centrality and importance of this domain to the study of native theories of health, disease, and medicine cannot be over- emphasized. At times, the human body, along with the perceived culturally varying relation- ships of its identified parts, has been used as a metaphor for society as a whole, as Douglas (1966) suggests, and as ethnologists in several West African societies have noted.3 Systematic study of native anatomical sys- tems, however, has been rare.4 This is unfor- tunate because this domain, in addition to its universality, is much larger than the more traditional color and kin terminological domains, and thus provides an expanded field for formu- * Present address: U.S.A. l.

Ethnoanatomy also brings into focus certain lexical/semantic problems and relationships largely bypassed in the current flush of articles appearing on folk biological classification.5 Ethnoanatomical studies which have been especially thorough are those of Werner and Begishe (1972), Lucier, VanStone, and Keats (1971), Marsh and Loughlin (1956), and Swan- son (1976) who list over 500, 400, 300, and 320 terms respectively. Most of these terms are descriptive compound lexemes and, as Marsh and Loughlin note for Aleut, special terms can be, and are, created as they are needed. This is true for Hopi and Gourma6 (and very likely most languages), and illustrates that languages in general, and naming systems in particular, are creative and open systems in the sense that virtually anything can be spoken of or named (in some fashion) if the occasion demands. There is no clear boundary between so called "ad hoc lexical compounds" and more "stable" ones. For comparative purposes we are interested in the unitary simple lexemes (cf. Conklin, 1962) which form the core and building units of any naming system.7 It is these terms which are used most frequently and which are most often extended to other domains. As will be noted later, semi-specialized and specialized knowledge aside, the number of unitary lexemes in ethno- I Cf.

Cross- cultural comparison of substantive lexical/ semantic domains has been hardly touched on. How, if, and in what ways such comparison can be made are largely unknown when we have understood that indeed "There are no exact correspondences between related words in dif- ferent languages, . . . (that) all communica- tion is one of degree" (Nida, 1975: p. 5). Ethno- anatomical studies are sparse and this renders our comparative results highly tentative. De- spite this, we are hopeful that even these pre- liminary results will stimulate more interest in and descriptive study of ethnoanatomical sys- tems. HOPI ETHNOANATOMY Hopi is a Uto-Aztecan language with about 6,000 speakers in northeastern Arizona. Their villages are located mainly on three successive mesas separated at about ten-mile intervals. Phonologically (Voegelin, 1956) and semantically (Schepers, 1969) these mesas form distinctive and surprisingly variable dialect groupings. A tradition of village autonomy and non-coopera- tion as an ethnic entity has presumably fostered this variability and at the same time retarded leveling tendencies. Because of such variability, we have con- centrated on the New Oraibi dialect of third mesa, while yet taking into account data from other mesas.9 An attempt has been made to eliminate elements that are peculiar to Oraibi Hopi without introducing peculiarities from other mesas. We have tried to approximate a semantic competence model for Hopi ethno- anatomical naming which excludes both dialect peculiarities and highly contextualized per- formance variability while yet permitting sensi- tivity to actual language performance. A further form of terminological variability 8 Specialized knowledge, by definition, respresents verbal behavior of only a small minority of any population. When the purpose for holding such knowledge is removed, lack of use leads to its ultimate disappearance in conscious memory. I In doing this, materials by Schepers, 1969, and Voege- lin, 1956, were of much help. Jeremy Exstrom, a Wycliff Bible translator among the Hopi, also made available to us some helpful data. in Hopi is that contributed by the existence of cultural specialists such as "bone doctors" and "massagers." Again this sort of variability is interesting but not relevant here as we are not taking the omniscient speaker/hearer point of view. Such a point of view, while valid, does not represent the competence system of the non-specialist Hopi and is therefore eschewed here. Table 1 below presents the seventy-one unitary simple body-part lexemes in Hopi.'0 It is significant to note that, despite dialect variations, these unitary lexemes are shared among the mesa groups. The nature in which these data are presented (i.e. a list) represents a position we wish to take concerning the lexical/ semantic organization of this domain. Ethno- linguistic concepts of human body parts have most often been presented in the literature by attractive charts showing the supposed lexical structure of the domain. One might consider Franklin's statement, for instance, that "All body parts in Kewa may be thought of as occurring on levels with contrasting parts on each level and each descending level subordinate to the level above it" (Franklin, 1963: p. 55). A more esoteric and recent illustration is given by Brown in which "human body partonomies" are analyzed into his "depth principle" that "Human anatomical partonomies rarely exceed five hierarchical levels in depth and never exceed six . . . levels" (Brown, 1976: p. 404). We feel that such presentations of anatomical 10 In this study, we shall be concerned primarily with the unitary simple lexemes which appear in the languages under discussion. Because it is occasionally extremely difficult to know whether a term is indeed semantically unitary or not, we have found the need to set down guide- lines. The great majority of unitary lexemes are recog- nizable as "expressions which can be said to be semantically unitary and linguistically distinct" (Berlin as quoted by Werner and Begishe, 1970: p. 248). A binomial lexeme is defined as "A naming unit that refers to or applies to an entity." This naming ulnit contains the name of a super- ordinate node which is a unitary lexeme and an addendum. The addendum may be a modifier or it may be modified by the unitary lexeme" (ibid., p. 248). We would add two further distinguishing aspects for a unitary lexeme. A unitary lexeme when compound in form (a) must have either drawn both (two or more) of its constituent parts from outside the anatomical domain, thus forming a new meaning through its combined parts, or (b) the semantic load of the term must not be the simple adding of the constituent parts. In English, for example, a term such as Adam's apple would be unitary because of (a) above whereas forearm, backbone, armpit, eyelash would not be because of (b).</page><page sequence="3">322 R. A.

This is not to state that the part-whole relation may not be a subconscious or non-verbalized reality in the anatomical domains of various languages. In the following discussions and study, we shall be interested in (1) what aspects of the human body are named, (2) the manner in which they are named and perceptually or- ganized, and (3) how in fact one communicates ethnoanatomical concepts. We believe that inalienable possession is the most important relation of this domain. If the terms of table 1 are to be put into any kind of structure, it will have to be two-leveled (fig. 1). PART-WHOLE VS. INCLUSION One problem in investigating part-whole domains as opposed to inclusion (kind of) domains is that the former relationship is less salient than the latter. Within inclusion domains, abstract terms such as "animal" are usually taught by definition. As a child one learns the names of animals and then is told that a horse is (a kind of) an animal, an elephant is an animal, or that a northern (pike) is a particular kind of fish. In teaching inclusion terms, the inclusion relationship itself is invoked.

Part-whole relationships present a different situation. Such relationships, for external or (made) visible areas at least, are generally physically obvious, or become so under pressure of some cultural/environmental stimulation. Here the development of cultural specializations may promote the extension of one or more of the physical senses (e.g., technological develop- ment and the microscope, telescope, radar, etc). All culturally differentiated totalities (e.g., human body, tree, dog, hammer, rock), which themselves may be parts of larger systems or composed of smaller ones, may be said to "possess" that of which they are perceived to be made up of. There is observable continuity among such parts with their whole. There is little or no need for discussing such relationships overtly. In English for instance, if the general referents of "fingers" and "hand" are known, then it is clear that the fingers are part of the hand (in the sense that if my hand is cut off I have lost five fingers as well). In learning by way of exemplification, one through use learns little by little the "focus" of the terms employed by speakers. Common agreement of reference is highest where objec- tive limitations of the referent in physical reality are present. Landar and Casagrande appropriately point out that "in the anatomical domain it is wise to avoid the begging of referential questions" (Landar and Casagrande, 1962: p. 370). Literates around the world learn semi- specialized and specialized (anatomical) terms through the educational system. This system must employ, either orally or by means of written word, the relation of part-whole. In a text on human anatomy one expects to read such information as "The part of the mouth cavity lying between the lips and the gums and teeth is known as the 'vestibule,' and that part behind the teeth as the 'mouth cavity proper' " (Best &amp; Taylor, 1963: p. 340). We conclude, therefore, that, apart from formal teaching of specialized knowledge, the part-whole relationship is seldom if ever invoked in learning part-whole concepts. It may not always be semantically realized in a language's surface structure. Schepers (1969) spent a summer among the Hopi trying to discover a sentence expressing this relationship. He even- tually succeeded in constructing a sentence with his informants which seemed to meet his need. Our similarly ambitious attempts produced the same results. With an informant's help, we were eventually able to come up with the frame " -at_ _ -at awiota" ( is connected to ) as in "M6avat tok6at awiota" (The arm/hand is connected to the body). Informants under- stood the sentence with some varying degrees of reluctance." The sentences were grammati- cally and semantically acceptable to the Hopi. They were, however, simply formal constructs of informants under pressure to "come up with something." The relation of part to whole is not elicitable in Hopi. These people simply do not talk about the body in that way. This idiom can often be obviated by using spatial references (e.g., "your chin is right below your mouth" rather than "your chin is part of your head or part of your face" or whatever'2). Spatial indicators such as "below," "between," "be- hind," "right," "left," "inside" are similar in nature to the so-called "connectedness relation" we came up with in Hopi. Even more to the point, of course, would be to say while pointing (or touching in the case of a blind person), 11 In conducting research among the Gourma of Upper Volta a year after the Hopi study, Swanson met the same situation. The relation of part to whole cannot be elicited among them. Yet under pressure, informants would eventually come up with a verb, such as "to join," ex- pressing the connective relation. Brown also notes the use of "connection" in the conceptual linking of anatomical parts (Brown, 1976: p. 407). He even goes so far as to make of it a principle of human anatomical partoilomy. "If a concept, /hand/ or /foot/, labeled or not, exists, it is most appropriately regarded as "connected to" rather than as 'part of' the native 'arm' or 'leg' respectively" (ibid., p. 420). Unfortunately this does not hold up in actual language performance. Neither are very important in the anatomical domain-at least as this concerns communication. 12 In dictionaries, however, we are given both possi- bilities. W'ebster's New World Dictionary (1964) defines it as "the part of the face below the lower lip" while a 1932 edition of Le Petit Larousse has it as (translated) "part of the face, below the mouth."</page><page sequence="5">324 R. A. SWANSON AND S. WITKOWSKI [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. "this is your chin," "this is your hand," and "these are your fingers," "this one is called the thumb," "this one. . . ." Even when the parts are not directly observable, there is a strong tendency to locate them relative to an observable part or felt sensation. As one Hopi told us: "your heart is in here right under your left breast. " Most existing studies of ethnoanatomy do not bother to give eliciting frames and their meaning. One cannot help but wonder whether Stark's (1969: pp. 1, 12) two Quechua frames are of the same order as those we came up with. Our experience with the verbally inappropriate "connective relationship" suggests that recent interest given to it may be misplaced (cf. Brown, 1976: pp. 407, 408, 420). Our informants were far more comfortable using inalienable possession as a vehicle for speaking about the body--their body. It seems possible that some writers in the literature have been too eager in placing the anatomical domain into neat, cut and dried, structures with the appropriate (and perhaps culturally and universally obvious) branchings and nicely labeled levels. Perhaps uncon- sciously, there has been the attempt to prove some kind of unilineal development for language. With possession as a basic relationship one avoids the messy and largely arbitrary problem of which lexemes are the appropriate ones to contrast at a given level.13 This makes cross- cultural comparisons of such structures almost impossible. Perplexing situations arise, for example, in which we are told that "uya" (face) contrasts with "uma" (non-face) at a given level (with "'uma"y meaning head on the level above), or that it is necessary to separate "caki" (knee- to-toe) and "caki" (foot) into two levels below "'aka" (leg) (Stark, 1969: pp. 1, 11, 12) (see fig. 2). Brown speaks of this when he states that "Frequently, when /hand/ or /foot/ is reported as labeled, it is described as named by the same unanalyzable primary (unitary) lexeme 13 It seems that many folk biologists are greatly over- simplifying their domains of study by largely ignoring the complete lexical/semantic distribution of the units dealt with. By being too precccupied with the classification of referents (e.g., kinds of birds), the multiple meanings of such lexemes are overlooked. In the same way, a systematic ethnoanatomical study must be done within the domain delimitations of the people concerned. Such a study among the Gourma became a study of human being, essentially an ethno-anthropology (Swanson, 1976). kjrpu (body) ............................ ...... a (leg) .. . ......... ... .. ... .. .. caki -to-toe) muqu (knee) caka (thigh) caki (foot) ................................................................

From Stark, 1969: p. 4. labeling/arm (and hand)/ or /leg (and foot)/ respectively" (Brown, 1976: p. 406).14 The notion of levels brings up Nida's (1975: p. 8) and Conklin's (1962: p. 132) theories which imply, according to Franklin, that "by noting which lexical hierarchies have the most divisions we know what is probably most important in the culture" (Franklin, 1963: p. 57). At least as it applies to human anatomy this seems to be simplistic. Nor do Nida and Conklin necessarily imply this.15 Following his line of thinking concerning Kewa anatomical naming, Franklin points out that the members subordinate to "loo" or stomach area seem especially significant on this basis. However, if such people have had the opportunity to butcher animals (as they apparently have), they would obviously have noted the objective and discrete entities to be found in the abdominal area. Any region of the body which tends to be named as discrete and which is itself made up of many discrete unities and discontinuities can be expected to have "more divisions." Certainly the head is a prime example of this. It does not follow that suclh divisions necessarily have any relation to "most important areas in a culture." Such divisions can be well seen in folk biology and undoubtedly do indicate areas of special cultural interest or relevance (cf. Berlin et al., 1974; Berlin, 1966; Hunn, 1975; Rosaldo, 1972), but the major principle at work here is the taxonomic one. 14 Brown when writing his article had access to an earlier version of our study of Hopi ethnoanatomy, to which he referred several times. Some concepts have been mcre thoroughly developed there (e.g., principles of human anatomical partonomy and some ideas as to the nature of growth of partonomic nomenclature) (Brown, 1976). 11 What Nida actually says, for instance, is that "The vocabulary relating to the focus of the culture is propor- tionately more exhaustive than that which refers to non- focal features. . . . Subcultures have proportionately more extensive vocabularies in the area of their distinctive- ness" (Nida, 1975: p. 8).</page><page sequence="6">VOL. 121, NO. 4, 1977] HOPI ETHNOANATOMY 325 INALIENABLE POSSESSION We have claimed that the inalienable posses- sion of anatomical terms is the principle or basic semantic relation of this domain and the part- whole relation is secondary at most. The possessor in this context is the human being- not the body. Each term in table 1 neatly and naturally fits into a frame expressing this relation. Part to whole and possession are comple- mentary aspects of the same phenomenon. Possession works from the general (whole) to the more specific (part) whereas part to whole, as implied, works from the more specific (part) to the more general (whole). The former is most often encountered in communicative inter- actions. Thus, "my leg" or "his head" are much more appropriate and elicitable expres- sions in Hopi (or any language) than the reverse relation of "the leg is part of my body" or "the head is part of his body"-which even in English is grammatically and semantically acceptable but somelhow does not sound right.'8 LEXICAL/SEMANTIC RICHNESS The number of unitary lexemes in ethno- anatomical systems seems to range from about 60 to 85 terms and is thus fairly constant cross- culturally.'7 This is interesting and seems to be an illustration of the proposal by Polani (1958: p. 78) that there are strong constraints on the overall richness of naming systems and that the meanings of words are formed and manifested by their repeated usage. There must always be fewer terms for objects than objects that could be named, simply because 18 It is interesting to note that to a certain extent this same principle holds true in taxonomic relations in that it is usually easier to elicit terms "down" the taxonomic tree than it is to elicit "up." To quote Werner and Begishe in their study of the Navaho "foot," "Folk-classifications are not necessarily shallow. Shallowness may be the result of the ease with which folk genera are elicitable and the fact that eliciting downward . . . is easy but working upward to more general terms is exceedingly difficult. There are, in fact, no adequate eliciting questions for working upwards" (1970: p. 250). We feel the posses- sion/part-whole system of relations has in this sense much in common with the problem of taxonomic elicitation. 17 This statement is based on only six of the seven languages surveyed in the etic grid (Quechua lacked data). It must be remembered that these languages represent numerous others so that Gourma, for example, is repre- sentative of scores of Africaii languages. It should also be recalled that specialized anatomical vocabulary is excluded. "having as many words as objects would be as cumbersome as a 1 :1 scale map (Werner, 1971: p. 48). The result, as Polani points out, is that one must have a fixed vocabulary of sufficient poverty to make it useful. There must be poverty to make it useful. There must be some basic consistency in reference or focus as well. Specialists and laymen will draw the line at different places. Since added increments of richness are less and less useful and more and more burdensome to a culture or subculture, lexical stabilization presumably occurs at the point where the added costs of richness cancel out the decreasing bene- fits of richness. Thus Polani's principle of the diminishing returns of richness of naming would account for the relatively constant number of ethnoanatomical unitary lexemes cross-socie- tally, under the assumption that the benefits and burdens of richness for this domain are generally similar. For domains such as fauna and flora and other physical environmental domains where, unlike ethnoanatomy, phe- nomenal variation is great, the assumption of equal benefits and burdens for richness of naming would not hold. This would lead us to predict extensive variation in the size of such domains, as, for instance, ethnobotanies. In the anatomical domain, the unitary simple lexemes serve as the building blocks with which, using various spatial modifiers or added ana- tomical nominal stems, virtually every spot or region of the body may be named. An in- vestigator with much patience and persistence may elicit many hundreds of terms (cf. Werner and Begishe, 1972; Marsh and Laughlin, 1956). The domain is an open and flexible one so far as non-unitary lexemes are concerned. Further- more, it seems evident that creative naming follows generally the same pattern in all lan- guages, given the varying syntactic differences and given the basic corpus of unitary lexemes. ANCILLARY TERMS'8 There are a number of established forms which non-unitary anatomical designations may take 18 The reader may refer to the appendix for the terms we were able to elicit of this nature. Included in this appendix are common synonyms for the unitary lexemes; unitary and compound lexemes that are peculiar to single mesas; and terms for body products and for occasional body features such as warts, moles, etc. This is not an exhaustive list nor do we claim complete accuracy in the transcription of all terms.</page><page sequence="7">326 R. A. SWANSON AND S. WITKOWSKI [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. in Hopi.-9 Perhaps most common are various naming patterns in which an anatomical stem is given preceded by an anatomical nominal stem indicating location. Following are a few of the elicited possibilities. In speaking of bones, a Hopi may state "I hapi pi'al6qa" (This is my hipbone); "I hapi h6:tdqa" (This is my back- bone). Hair found specifically on the thigh or shin may be called "qa:sho:mi" (lit. thigh hair) or "nam6ho:mi" (lit. shin hair) although the unitary lexeme "ho:mi" (hair) is generally acceptable when unspecified. The unitary lexeme "tahui" may designate any tough fibrous substance such as a ligament, gristle, nerve fiber, or tendon. Thus one may hear expressions such as "p6stahii" (lit. eye fiber) for optic nerve, or "kiu'ktahui" for foot tendon. "P616" (or with morphophonemic changes "volo") meaning humped or rounded up, may be constructed with various lexemes resulting in such legitimate combinations as "mAcp6lC" for arm muscle (may refer to muscle in general), "qaspolo" for thigh muscle, and "h6tv6lo" for back muscle. The spatial modi- fier "qolo" signifying depression on the other hand may appear in such binomials as "kukq61" (sole of foot) or "mapqolo" (palm). Other spatial and adjectival terms may be combined with various unitary lexemes for other purposes.20 Thus speaking of one's lower teeth one could refer to "atkyTk tama" (lit. lower teeth). The modifier "wuiko" (lit. big) may be used among a large number of ana- tomical sites. When used of teeth, "wtik6tama" will refer to the large teeth or molars. When used of the fingers, "wtik6malaci" specifies the thumb. Knowing that in English we dif- ferentiate the large and small intestines, one informant has begun using "wUk6si :hui" to designate large intestines, while unitary "si :hui" has for him continued to refer to intestines in general and could be, in some cases, small intestines. People with pointed heads are said to possess "cukuiqt6" (lit. sharp-pointed head). "Ciuku`- tama" would thus refer to sharp-pointed teeth, 19 Our Hopi transcription follows more or less the form proposed by Voegelin. The glottal stop? is the first sound of every Hopi word which begins with a vowel and is therefore in such cases deleted. Hopi vowels are a, e, i, u, 6, and o. We have seen u written as I in some orthographies. 20 See Werner and Begishe, 1970, for a thorough dis- cussion of such modification in terms of the foot in Navaho. in some cases used for the canine. "Putsq6t6" (lit. flat head) refers to a head whose back part is flat, usually as a result of the effect of the traditional cradle board on the heads of Hopi infants. "Puitskoho" (lit. flat, hard) may refer to the lower jaw bone (also the boomerang). If the need should arise to speak of the "tips" of anything, one could say "leIicki" for tip of the tongue, "malAcki" (lit. arm/hand tip) for the tip of the finger, and "yaqacki" for tip of the nose. Various body spaces may be referred to in similar ways. "Hovakni" designates the space between the buttocks. "KUkvosacava?a" is the space between the toes; "ma: ?acava ?a" the space between the arm and the body; and "qa :sacava ?a" the space between the thighs. "Vawi" referring to tubes or vessels is generally used in such lexemes as "iiijvawi" (blood vessels). The large vessels connected to the heart are designated as "unaijvawi," whereas specific vessels in various parts of the body may be referred to as, for example, "hokya iiijvawi" (lit. lower leg blood vessels). As such construc- tions are hardly, if ever, used in normal dis- cussion, they simply lie within the realm of possibility. It is evident that Hopi can and does produce such combinations as the need arises. Some variations become, for one reason or another, more common in discourse, while others are only there to be used if needed. It is for this reason that one often meets a variety of "ac- ceptable" ways of saying basically the same thing. Repeated usage standardizes forms. Often recurring statements from informants were: "Well, we can say that if we need to"; or "That's the way they (non-Hopi English speakers) say it, we say it this way. We know what they mean," or "So and so and I will put our words together (in looking for a term for a previously unnamed referent)." The way such words are "put together" is culturally determined by ready patterns in the language. The consistent use of such patterns renders new or occasional patterns understandable and ac- ceptable. The importance of knowing the extent and nature of such naming is obvious in its proven usefulness in such areas as cross-cultural com- munication between medical personnel and patients. Interesting conceptual differences of- ten arise in the construction of binomials and</page><page sequence="8">VOL. 121, NO. 4, 1977] HOPI ETHNOANATOMY 327 trinomials (cf. footnote 7) when such terms are compared cross-culturally. However, cross-cul- tural comparison of such vocabulary running into hundreds of terms becomes unwieldy and will be left here as an area for separate discussion. It is those basic unitary lexemes, those ana- tomical building blocks-which carry the burden of reference in this domain and which deserve our further attention. COMPARATIVE ETHNOANATOMY Three separate but interrelated issues present themselves in this discussion of comparative ethnoanatomy. First there is the problem of devising an analytic or reference language for describing the unitary lexemes of body-part systems. This language would be comparable in function to the genealogical notations used in kinship studies. As Goodenough (1970) points out, such analytic languages (or grids) can only be devised by examining a wide variety of specific language systems. Our development here of a partial reference language for describing body-part systems is necessarily tentative be- cause only seven different language systems are employed. In addition, we eschew the use of esoteric symbols in favor of common English glosses. Any other language could have ful- filled the requirements. A second area of interest is that of common reference or perhaps more precisely stated, the extension of human body-part terms to other domains. Especially interesting are set extensions which involve the partial but sys- tematic extension of terms and taxonomic hierarchy from one domain to another (cf. Basso, 1967). For this the semantic mapping of lexemes is of concern. Thirdly the nature of lexical/semantic di- versity and constraints in language and the search for semantic universals is briefly dis- cussed. We shall commence with this last issue. We take it for granted that, even as in the physical universe, both diversity and similarity exist in native semantic systems. We lay important stress on the relative proportions and exact delineation of this similarity and diversity. To this end, three levels of cross- cultuiral comparison are evident. POSSIBLE VS. IMPOSSIBLE SEMANTIC DIVERSITY The first level distinguishes possible from impossible semantic diversity. Impossible di- versity which is logically or theoretically pos- sible, but in fact never occurs. Impossible diversity is one evidence for universal naming constraints. Discontinuous categorizing of body parts, for example, does not occur. This is true of mirror-image naming as well. Thus at the unitary lexemic naming level, left ear is never distinguished from right ear, or left leg from right leg, or left breast from right breast, or right side of the body from the left side, and so on. The human body is largely symmetrical anatomically and it is seen and named ac- cordingly. Lest this example seem trivial, it should be stressed that this sort of naming could occur, and if there were not severe constraints on the richness of semantic diversity, we would expect it to occur. Thus the huge amount of semantic diversity which could exist but which in fact never does is evidence for universal naming constraints. It should be possible to devise a theory on the contraints upon naming.2" POSSIBLE SEMANTIC DIVERSITY Within the realm of possible (i.e. actually existing) semantic diversity, different language systems make varying combinations of dis- tinctions, based on the unitary lexemes, and due perhaps to some extent on the particular theory of the human body the language users possess (Green, 1974; Swanson, 1972, 1976). To measure this, an index could conceivably be developed which would assess the relative proportions of similarity and diversity in native anatomical systems. The proportions for indi- vidual systems could be averaged thus giving an overall picture of diversity and similarity for the domain as a whole. It would be ex- pected that different naming domains would vary greatly in their similarity-diversity ratios. UNIVERSAL SEMANTIC CONCEPTS Underlying the realm of actually occurring semantic diversity is a hypothesized third, deeper level. Such a level, were the evidence more complete, would probably consist of a number of semantically universal concepts which, when combined with certain, as yet 21 Brown (1976) has made some initial progress in this direction. See also footnote 14.</page><page sequence="9">328 R. A. SWANSON AND S. WITKOWSKI [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. unknown, rules of expansion may generate a grid of culturally possible diversity. Though the analytic grid in table 2 generates some relevant data in this direction, detailed formulation of this level must await the gathering of more native anatomical data. Some of the results we might expect to obtain when such data are available would be: separable dimen- sions of semantic variability, a host of implica- tional and perhaps a few absolute universals, and probably some universal semantic primes. ANALYTIC LANGUAGE A completely adequate reference language for the unitary lexemes of anatomical domains can only be devised after examining a wide variety of language systems. Essentially an analytic language should contain enough dis- tinctions so that it will be inclusive of all specific language systems. Because there are objective unities and discontinuities in nature which are reflected in naming systems and because there are constraints on the overall richness of such systems, these analytic distinctions are not potentially infinite. An analytic language can not therefore contain distinctions which are never found in specific language systems.22 A properly constructed analytic grid, in addition to its descriptive purposes, becomes a theory defining the limits of language diversity- in this particular case of unitary lexemic di- versity in the anatomical domain. To illustrate the possible nature of such grids, we present in table 2 the preliminary results for human body extremities using data from Hopi, Gourma, English, Quechua, Navaho, French, and Aleut.23 22 Let us point out that, because of the flexibility of language in describing what needs to be spoken of and because of the existence of accepted forms of binomials and trinomials, any emic blank spot on this grid can in some fashion be filled. A few such "Lerms" may be grammatically and conceptually "understood" by the language users even though perhaps not consistent with their actual perception of the human body and actual use in communicative situations 23 Hopi data come from the author's research among the Hopi during the summer of 1972; Quechua data are from Stark (1969); Gourma data from Swanson (1976); Navaho data come from Werner and Begishe (1972); French from Swanson's research in French Switzerland (Neuchatel); and Aleut data are drawn from Marsh and Loughlin (1956). As will become apparent, there were several gaps in the data of these sources. The Aleutian material may include a little error as the data were difficult at times to interpret in terms of the semantic components of the various lexical units given. NATURE OF SEMANTIC DIVERSITY AND SIMILARITY As will be seen by examining the table of unitary lexemes, there appears to be a good deal of semantic diversity among these lan- guages. This diversity is, in fact, a good deal higher than perhaps might be expected. Still, existing semantic similarity is sub- stantial. Such similarity provides the bedrock upon which successful translation and inter- cultural communication is made possible. With- out it, many cultures would form little islands forever separate from each other. Intercultural communication depends on the fact that there is a substantial amount of semantic similarity or overlap. The potential for miscomrnunica- tion can be attributed to existing semantic diversity.24 Interestingly, there seem to be certain types of semantic diversity which are so extreme that it is unlikely that any society would sub- scribe to them. Such impossible diversity was alluded to when we noted that an analytic grid provided at least an implicit theory of the limits of semantic diversity among languages. The very structure of the grid tells something about the way we see the domain ordered. It seems unlikely, for example, that any society would unite the foot and the upper leg into a category opposed to the lower leg. This would violate the objective, connective ordering present as a physical fact. For the seven languages ex- amined here, such "discontinuous" naming is never the case, and it can be reasonably asserted that such categorizing will never be the case for 24 Such diversity and similarity are influenced both by the lexical/semantic structure of the language in question as well as the perception of real objects and events in the cultural environment. Of language structure Nida states that "An analysis of deep structures of different languages shows rather startling similarities. In fact, the deeper the analysis, the more alike, or even identical, the structure appears to be. It would seem that ultimately the deepest structural level involves simply a pool of semantic uni- versals-what any language can say" (Nida, 1975: p. 84). The Sapir-Whorfian hypothesis of linguistic relativity could be summarized by saying that the linguistic structure of a particular community "constraints" its cognitive organization. We would have to say that this pessimistic orientation towards the possibility of human intercom- munication does not take into account what Bulmer has called the objective unities and discontinuities in nature" which are reflected in semantic systems. This, along with the facts of shared humanity and basic similarities among language deep structures, offers more optimistic cause for faith in the feasibility of inteihuman communication. Only in this way can "translational equivalence across languages and cultures" be possible (Nida, 1975).</page><page sequence="10">VOL. 121, NO. 4, 19771 HOPI ETHNOANATOMY 329 TABLE 2 ANALYTIC GRID Etic Terms Hopi Gourma English Quechua Navaho French Aleut Human being simo nilo person runa din6 personne ?

Such a limitation on semantic diversity would constitute a universal principle of human naming. Modern sciences, in fact, are themselves based upon a similarily reliable linking principle (i.e. cause and effect), the assurance without which they would cease to exist. We have stated that there appears to be a good deal of semantic diversity. The chart tells us, for example, that there is no unitary lexeme in Hopi, Gourma, or Quechua for what English refers to as "the hand." The Hopi unitary lexeme "ma :?a" is inclusive of both English terms "arm" and "hand." Nor do these languages have a unitary lexeme resembling the English term "toe." Our grid consists only of unitary lexemes.25 25 A word needs to be said about the growth of unitary terms in a language. Such growth seems largely to take place in the context of specialized knowledge which, in this case, does perhaps show a cultural focus or interest. Our Western interest in medicine and disease has certainly led to an extensive specialized and semi-specialized ana- tomical lexicon-with numerous unitary lexemes involved. Marsh and Laughlin state for the Aleut: "The corpus of specific non-descriptive terms can be extended only through foreign borrowing, since in Aleut, as in most languages, words do not seem to be made out of whole cloth" (1956: p. 51).</page><page sequence="11">330 R. A. SWANSON AND S. WITKOWSKI [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. One might be led to ask whether or not the starred spaces (*) are not also named in some fashion-be it with a binomial, trinomial, or whatever lexeme. Most of these spaces are named or are potentially namable. Numerous terms exist which do not even appear in the analytic language (i.e. top of foot, spaces be- tween toes, whorls on toes, kneecap, little fingernail, etc.). In Hopi more than half of these are trinomials, quadrinomials, or composite in structure, while less than half are binomials.26 A few of the conceptual differences which arise in non-unitary naming might be high- lighted. In English we rarely use the terms "sole" or "arch" apart from further descriptive information such as "of the foot," or "of my shoe"-unless context has been defined earlier in discourse. A homonym such as "soul" may take explicitness necessary (e.g. *He hurt his soul.). The Hopi binomial "kiikqolo" (sole of foot) literally means "foot depression" while the Navaho trinomial "hakt&amp;?aa?" for the sole of the foot literally refers to "person's foot surface facing downward" (note the use of inalienable possession) (Werner, personal com- munication). Gourmas speak of "onukpan- dunli" (elbow) literally meaning "hand-spear- knee." From their unitary lexeme "lidunli" (knee) they construct the term for elbow- there having been some perceived symmetry here for them. Such symmetry is evidenced again in the French expression "les doigts" (the fingers). Thus the toes become "les doigts du pied," literally "the fingers of the foot." 27 This kind of naming is common in anatomical vocabulary and deserves proper consideration in a cross-cultural comparison. This, however, is outside the scope of the present study. Certain starred spots in the grid for any particular language, however, are not named in any fashion because they are included in a higher order unitary lexeme of which they are but a part-in such cases carrying the name of that more general term. This is a point which we feel requires further comment. 26 In Gourma, intensive study revealed 81 unitary lexemes, 151 binomials, 57 trinomials, and 24 quadri- nomials in the anatomical domain (Swanson, 1976). Nor was this exhaustive, for non-unitary lexemes for mirror- image naming were not included (e.g., right arm, left arm, right little toe, left little toe, etc.). 27 In discourse, when context has been established as being with the "foot," the toes may simply be called "les doigts." THE DUCK-DRAKE PROBLEM "Ma: ?a" we have noted includes the total arm and hand as designated in English. If a Hopi is asked the term employed for his hand he'll give this term "ma:?a" as he will for both his upper arm and lower arm. If the Hopi had perceived the arm/hand to be composed of two or more discrete sections we would know of it through established terms-whether unitary or otherwise. Ask a Navaho (pointing) to name "finger" and he will give the term "h6la?" as he will likewise do if you point at his "hand." The same is true for "hakee?" (foot), as the "toes" themselves are called "hakee?". It seems evident to us that a language will either name a perceived body part without bothering about giving further specifics to sub-parts there- of, or, for one reason or another, the sub-parts will come to be given terms-the former term either becoming more narrowed in its meaning or retaining its inclusive character. Although logically (by perception and inclusion) perhaps "saha" (calf) and "nAmo" (shin) are parts of "hokya" (lower leg minus foot), this is not a relation that is readily talked about in Hopi. Approached from this angle, it would seem that we could avoid the situation presented by Louisa Stark (see p. 11) in which "caka" (thigh) is contrasted on a different level from "caka" (leg) or "caki" (knee-to-toe) on a different level from "caki" (foot). The part has simply been given the same term as the whole since no differ- entiation has been provided in the language. There is no conceptual differentiation. They are not homonyms nor do we believe this is a case of polysemy. We see here the investigator's sense for the need of differentiation. The fact that we "feel" the need for a separate term for hand and finger shows our own conceptual bias. When a particular lexical discrimination needs to be made, this will be done by the language users.28 This concept is valid for many similar con- currences in other domains of language. One might think of the duck-drake or fox-vixen differentiations in the animal domains in which 28 Lexical differentiation can reveal something concerning the semantic structure of a language, and, as Nida points out, "Since the structural relationships of semantic units (1) reflect a classification of experience and (2) are subject to change as beliefs and attitudes towards the symbols and the corresponding referents change, one should reckon with the semantic structure as providing significant clues to a people's orientation toward life" (1975: p. 69).</page><page sequence="12">VOL. 121, NO. 4, 1977] HOPI ETHNOANATOMY 331 special distinctions are made. If these were to be diagrammed, they should be done as shown in figure 3 (here possession and inclusion being demonstrated). Among the ducks, the drake, or male is given the special distinction, while the female is not so distinguished and therefore is simply called a "duck." Among foxes the same is true except that the sex is reversed. BOUNDARIES Landar and Casagrande, previously quoted, indicated that the problem as to degree of agreement on the reference of anatomical terms is a real one. Boundaries between the referents are not clearly focused. One would not, in fact, expect otherwise. Such discrete boundaries do not exist in objective, physical reality. Where in fact is the precise boundary between the arm and the hand in English? We might define this general area in terms of the wrist. Where, however, is the boundary between the sole of the foot and the heel and how would one name it? It is worth noting that among the seven languages of the analytic grid, it is what we might call the "dividers" or "general markers of boundaries" that most closely approach what we might refer to as named semantic universal con- cepts or primes. Shoulder, elbow, hip, and knee are almost universal for these seven languages. Of the possible twenty-eight such terms on the grid, twenty-five are named, semantically similar unitary lexemes. Of the remaining three, two are Gourma and named (e.g., the trinomial "linukpandunli" already reviewed), while the third, a Quechua space, seems to have no term according to Stark's data. Interestingly enough, wrist and ankle do not seem to be widely named -even on a binomial or trinomial level. Out- side our analytic grid we might think of "neck" as a boundary of sorts and it too is almost uni- versally named as discrete. u(body) toko (body) fox If~~ I gm 'Saki ua:'a (lg/foot) (knee) (kee-to-to.)

ANATOMICAL EXTENSION Extension can be either "egressive" (the extension of terms from the body-part domain to other domains) or "ingressive" (the extension from other domains into the body-part domain) (Stark, 1969). Extension can also be casual or systematic. Whereas casual extension seems to be more sporadic as to the objects it wishes to treat, set extension will employ many ana- tomical terms (suggesting perhaps a stronger organismic tendency) giving one the major features of an anthropomorphic figure. Sys- tematic or set extension is illustrated in Basso (1967) where he discusses the extension of a whole group of anatomical terms in Western Apache to describe the anatomy of the auto- mobile. In English (and perhaps all languages) we certainly anthropomorphize supernatural figures as well as animals through set extension. In discussing extension, one is tempted to ignore the problem of directionality. Speaking of kinship, Hocart (1936) pointed out that most of the usages referred to as extensions are mis- leading because in most cases we do not know the directionality of such extension. Because of the centrality of anatomical extended naming units to the lexical/semantic system of the human body, we do not feel the directionality of extension to be as serious an issue in this domain. In fact, not having evidence to the contrary, we would hypothesize that unitary anatomical naming terms used in other contexts from the human body have been extended into such contexts. This may be done by means of metaphor or simile. There is much casual extension in language. For English we have such usages as the "head of state," the "strong arm of the law," the "heel of bread" (but not the head, leg, or hand of the bread), "what a heel," the "shoulder of a mountain," the "mouth of the cave," the "heart of the matter," "soft-hearted," and so on and on. Determining what the units of cross-cultural comparison should be becomes a looming prob- lem. Do we look for namable parts all people have in common? Not all people have kayaks (cf. Marsh and Loughlin, 1956) and even auto- mobiles are not yet universal. There are at least two areas that are universal and these are the domains of plant parts and animal parts. The use of human body-part terms for describing animal parts is very widespread and interesting study here may involve the relative strength</page><page sequence="13">332 R. A. SWANSON AND S. WITKOWSKI [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. of such extended use and some calculus of similarity. The use of human body-part terms for describing plant parts is not unknown either. It would seem to us, however, that the benefits to cultural understanding in searching for such extension or lack of extension to certain limited namable "objects" in the external environment would be unnecessarily limiting, even unproductive. Of more interest would be simply an inventory from culture to culture of those named or perceived "objects" in man's experience of his world which carry anatomical labels. When and to what is egressive extension permitted? What is the semantic distribution of anatomical lexemes? Does this tell us some- thing about the people or the particular referents involved ? The emphasis we wish to make here, however, is the importance of the basic unitary lexemes in both casual and systematic extension. With rare exceptions, such lexemes are the only kinds so extended.29 A brief survey will serve to show just how true this is as well as to point out the cultural importance played by such terms. Nineteen anatomical terms are employed by Western Apache in their extended usage to the automobile. All are unitary. They consist of: shoulder (front fender) mouth (opening of pipe hand/arm (front leading to gas tank) wheel, tire) eye (headlights) chin/jaw (front bumper) vein (electrical foot (rear wheel, tire) wiring) face (area extending entrails (all machinery from tip of wind- under hood) shield to bumper) liver (battery) forehead (front portion stomach (gas tank) of cab or automobile heart (distributor) top) lung (radiator) nose (hood) intestines (radiator back (bed of truck) hose) fat (grease) (Basso, 1967: p. 472) Among the Navaho, "The proper order for the description of the human body in prayers and justified in mythology as the proper order of the creation of the human body by the Holy 29 This observation corresponds to the fact that "the different meanings of single lexical units are far more separate in semantic space (i.e., they are far more different from each other) than the related meanings of different terms" (Nida, 1975: p. 103). Different meanings may have risen from extension. Semantic distancing of differ- ent meanings of the same term (e.g., use in different con- texts) lessens communicative misunderstandings. People is: foot, leg, hip, trunk, shoulder, arm, hand, neck, and the head" (Werner and Begishe, 1970: p. 247). Every one of these is a unitary simple lexeme. One may catalog pages and pages on every culture's use of the various internal organs for the descriptive and often believed seat of psychological characteristics (cf. Swanson, 1972). "The Habbes of the French Sudan speak of sorrow as having a sick liver. The Bambaras . . say that sorrow is having a black eye. The Mossi people . . . (and the Gourma) insist that sorrow is having a rotten heart, while the Uduks in the Sudan describe sorrow as having a rotten stomach" (Nida, 1975: p. 10). The senti- ment of love may be in the liver (Karre, Africa), abdomen (Conob, Guatemala), throat (Marshal- lese, South Pacific), heart (English) or gall bladder (Gourma, Mossi, Upper Volta) (ibid., p. 67). The anatomical morphemes of these usually binomial or trinomial lexemes are always, to our knowledge, unitary lexemes. Many West African people use the human body and its parts in extension/projection to their perceived universe. The Bambara, for instance, project the human body to all life, so that, for example, The head of a man corresponds to the tops of the trees and bushes, the trunk to the trunk of a tree and the branches of a bush to arms and the feet to the roots. Bark corresponds to the human skin, flowers to the genitals and in particular the menstrual blood . . . Therefore, when having some form of head disease, parts of the "heads" of things in nature will be used (Swanson, 1972: p. 83). This fits with Rosaldo's remarks concerning the Ilongots of the Philippines. Anatomical concepts provide certain distinctions which are often needed in different contexts of life. "Ilon- gots explain," says Rosaldo, "that different species are used in magic because of the sig- nificance of their names" (Rosaldo, 1972: p. 87). Different species of orchids are named thighs, fingernails, braids, thumbs, fingers, elbows, knees, calves, whiskers. The anatomical parts are for various reasons identified with features in orchids. "A speciman which one man calls 'their fingers'-explaining that each leaf is a finger-may at another time be called 'their thighs' because the leaves are curved or 'their thumbs' because they are squat. In any one context, Ilongots insist that the name they are giving is the name for the orchid in question" (ibid., p. 90). In each of these cases, we have</page><page sequence="14">VOL. 121, NO. 4, 19771 HOPI ETHNOANATOMY 333 been discussing anatomical features which have been given unitary lexemic designations. Watson and Nelson (1967) have suggested the orifices of the body "as the foci of major material transactions with the environment. These orifices are the mouth, nostrils, eyes, ears, genitalia, anus, and initially the navel." The female breasts are included provisionally. It was suggested that such orifices offer a standard model for cross-cultural analysis. An argument which Watson and Nelson could have used in justification of their choice of anatomical parts could have been that these terms indicate dis- crete, objective named areas of the body from culture to culture. They are, with few excep- tions, among the named semantic universal concepts of the human body (and therefore unitary simple lexemic in form). It is evident therefore that the role of ana- tomical unitary lexemes in extension is an important one and that further study needs to be made as to wlhiclh terms are extended in a particular language. We need to attempt to understand wlhy this is so and why certain terms are not so extended. Only in so doing can we come to understand the semantic structure of this domain from one culture to another and thereby perceive the extent to which indeed the human body "serves man as a basis for all other spatial specifications. One he has formed a distinct representation of his own body, once he has apprehended it as a self-enclosed and intrinsically articulated organism, it becomes as it were, a model according to which he con- stitutes the world as a whole" (Cassirer, 1953: p. 206). CONCLUSION The continuities and discontinuities revealed semantically through language are often ob- jectively "out there" and are not solely the possession of the language itself. Language is not totally autonomous. It is not wholly independent of the way our universe is ordered any more than it is independent of the concrete experiences and subjective feelings of mnan in that universe. MNTan must conform to the order and patterns which exist both in the lexical/semantic structure of language and his world if lhe is to exist effectively and communicate in the universe. This order itself makes com- munication possible. Through study of Hopi ethnoanatomy we have attempted to demonstrate the severe constraints which operate to set close limits on semantic diversity. A possible approach to the semantic organization and structure of this domain lhas been discussed. The central role played by anatomical unitary lexemes (1) as the building blocks of any anatomical system; (2) as the prime units used in egressive extension; and (3) as providing the foundation by means of whiclh a comiprehensive, systematic, informa- tive, and successful cross-cultural comparison can be effected, has been underlined. Neither the physical universe nor the mninds of men include everything imaginable. That semantic diversity is much more constrained than we have been traditionally willing to allow argues for a fundamental underlying uniformity not only in human cognitive and perceptual behavior, but in the objective and drastic limitations of physical possibilities in nature as well. We hope that the preliminary results obtained in this paper will stimulate further research in ethnoanatomy cross-culturally.
