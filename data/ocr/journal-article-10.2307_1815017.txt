<plain_text><page sequence="1">PROBLEM OF ACHIEVING AND MAINTAINING FULL EMPLOYMENT SOME QUESTIONS EMERGING UNDER THE EMPLOYMENT ACT By EDWIN G. NOURSE Joint Council on Economic Education I There is a striking disparity between the grand national purposes de- clared in the Employment Act of 1946 and the paralyzing squabbles that have erupted in the steel industry and that impend for the automobile and railway industries in 1960. As setting for an analysis of causes of this disappointing development and for promising means of combating or, if possible, reversing it, I submit several all-too-categorical proposi- tions. The Keynesian dialectic for a high-production economy sustained by the grace of compensating fiscal policy and stabilizing monetary policy has proved inadequate for dealing successfully with the postwar problems of our economy. We have been confronted with many opera- tional dilemmas in trying to adapt particular pricing and income- determining institutions and practices to the higher price level which had been, in a very irregular pattern, induced by the tumultuous war- time developments and improvisations. Alvin Hansen admirably pre- viewed the complex nature of the Employment Act problem in his Economic Policy and Full Employment (1947). Referring to inflation as "the immediate danger," he said: "In our modern, highly compli- cated economic order we are continually in danger. It is not easy to keep the system in balance. That involves not only fiscal and monetary controls, but also, among other things, a balanced wage-and-price policy, control of monopoly, promotion of high productivity, technical progress and, above all, social unity and cohesiveness. [Italics added.] Stability, maximum production, and full employment are not easily achieved goals. We are perhaps out of the kindergarten, but we still have a long way to go." (Page vii.) Unfortunately, neither Hansen nor any great number of our fad- following profession felt moved to explore the private market prereq- uisites for full employment symmetrically with their explorations of the public control aspects. But thirteen years of experience, during which conditions have been very favorable and performance of the 130</page><page sequence="2">PROBLEM OF FULL EMPLOYMENT 131 economy on the whole quite gratifying, have shown that, under the in- stitutions and the mores of our enterprise economy, "opening the money spigot" wide enough to get full employment results in dangerous infla- tion and "reversing the money pump" drastically enough to prevent inflation produces intolerable unemployment. The continued rise in industrial prices and service rates during the 1957-58 recession while un- employment persisted or even mounted has now caused attention to shift to this field. This has given us the catch phrase "cost-push" inflation. I myself have been moved to label the phenomenon "institutionalized" in- flation; that is, an inflationary trend built into the market process through the institutions of the large corporation, the big union, and big government sensitive to the political pressures of special-interest groups. This institutionalized inflation embraces not only the conditioning struc- tures of business, labor, and government but also personal attitudes and group practices-the mores or ideologies of the elite groups which, as corporation executives, union leaders, Administration and Congressional officials, constitute our effective cadre of policy-makers. To grasp the complex realities of institutionalized inflation and gauge the possibilities of achieving sustained high production without periodic disruption of price-and-income alignments, our American "mixed" eco- nomic system may be visualized as a global process comprising a hemi- sphere of private business administration and a complementary hemi- sphere of public economic administration. This public hemisphere is divided into quarter-spheres of credit administration and spending- taxing administration. The private hemisphere is similarly divided into quarter-spheres of capital administration or price-investment policy and labor resource administration and wage negotiation. These four quarter- spheres of the economy, though separable for many purposes of analy- sis, are intricately intermeshed in actual operation. Thus, there cannot be an effective demand-pull that is independent of the cost-pushes of speculative business enterprise and resource-owners' opportunism. Nor can there be an effective cost-push that gets very far in defiance of the power of appropriation committees and credit agencies to "advise and consent." Fiscal policy is a powerful initiating and guiding force as it injects funds here and drains them off there. But also it is strongly conditioned by the price or cost situations brought about by the specula- tive and innovating activities of management and by the offensive and defensive strategies of organized labor.1 For example, cost of govern- 1 While recognizing the withering of the Invisible Hand and moving to repeal Say's Law, we should take some care not to throw out realism's baby with the theoretical bath water. Labor's wage advances and management's markups are income generating, and pro tanto demand creating or fortifying-so long as the Fed and/or the fisc continue to put up the chips-and productive capacity is not allowed to breach the dam of price maintenance.</page><page sequence="3">132 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION ment payroll and procurement and the yield of any tax structure are markedly affected by the level and structure of prices and of incomes brought about by the administrative policies of management and of organized labor and their articulations through collective bargaining. To a very important extent, therefore, both fiscal policy and monetary policy are the captives of market policy or, stated more precisely, cap- tive to market behavior, with its decisive administrative component. To recognize this fact of our economic life today is to realize the sterility of the aggregate demand formula in the unique causative, explanatory, and correctional sense in which it has been so freely used in recent years. The tough questions ultimately raised by the Employment Act are not primarily or dominantly those of public action to compensate for failure of the private economy to effect sustained high production. They are basically questions of how to forestall such failure by improv- ing the institutions of the market-for goods, for services, and for funds -and how to raise the mores of individual and administrative respon- sibility2 to a level compatible with the character of modern industry and trade. While permitting and indeed facilitating such concentrations of private economic power as are needed for efficiency in handling our fast-advancing technology, we need also to effect disciplines (i.e., group behaviors) in a domain that we have debouched into but by no means mastered. Our objective should be to preserve that "free competitive enterprise" premised in the Employment Act, not as a mere abstract ideal, but to make that freedom and the competition among larger op- erating units that results therefrom achieve the high economic goal of maximum consumer real purchasing power better than atomistic comn- petition ever served the much less ambitious objectives of Smith's, Ricardo's, and Malthus' time. Big-unit competition must find an opti- mum blend of internal constraint, that achieves discipline in its own ranks, and such co-operation among special interests as will promote a constellation of private prosperities as integrated parts of maximum national prosperity. II Concentrations of private economic power are a perfectly normal manifestation of the economics of enterprise. Under our traditional principle of free private enterprise we have permitted the ambition, the ingenuity, and the daring of business leaders to develop the indus- trial and the commercial corporation to the point where a single firm may hold assets, develop money flows, and control personnel to an ex- tent that exceeds the economic power of any one of perhaps a quarter of our sovereign states or of many a foreign country. The right of both 2I do not say social responsibility because I believe that the economist qua economist should keep his analysis on the operative or technological rather than the moralistic plane.</page><page sequence="4">PROBLEM OF FULL EMPLOYMENT 133 horizontal and vertical integration permitted under the law (despite occasional curbs) has contributed powerfully to the stimulating of pro- duction, the enlargement of employment opportunities, and marked rise in the real purchasing power of consumers. Its impact on national stability has been more equivocal. Paralleling the development of the giant corporation, we have, under our traditional principle of free private enterprise, permitted the am- bitions, the ingenuity, and the daring of labor leaders to build up unions of size and power in many regards approaching and in some regards surpassing those of the largest corporations. Much as the "in- fant industry" argument in the manufacturing area in time became an absurdity, so the "underdog" justification for public policy furtlher en- larging the rights allowed to, and the benefits conferred upon, organized labor has become obsolete. The workability of a system of free competitive private enterprise under modern conditions pivots on the institution of collective bargain- ing, and it had seemed an almost axiomatic proposition that all that was necessary to give bargaining between units of unlimited size the same beneficence as that traditionally ascribed to atomistic bargaining was for private action to promote and public authority to! permit structures that would achieve "equality of bargaining power." It would be hard, how- ever, to concoct a phrase more elusive in interpretation and more un- toward in its application than this one-unless it be "bargaining in good faith." Instead of promoting market equilibrium through rational juxta- position of supply realities against demand realities, each side sought to maximize its fire power to force a decision which would be to its financial advantage. The consequences of this line of development seem nlow to lhave brought us to the distressing alternatives of inflation or return to the cold war of the class struggle. Ratl-ier than countervailing against each other to achieve high pro- duction and price stability, great concentrations of economic power be- come a prime initiating and aggravating force of inflation. Instead of an apparatus of wholesome adjustment, we get a continuing race for more power on both sides and impasse when the summit is reached. Neither party is willing to admit that collective bargaining fulfills its role as balance wheel through "equality of bargaining power" if it has to accept contract terms below the level of its demands. Paraphrasing George Orwell's brilliantly satirical phrase in Animal Farm: Both pigs must be equal, but each pig must be more equal than the other. Success of the industrial union tactic of striking that oligopolistic employer who appeared at the moment to be in the most vulnerable position or to have a recognized position of policy leadership moved the steel companies this year to confront the solidarity of the United</page><page sequence="5">134 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION Steel Workers union with the matching solidarity of the twelve major steel producing companies. But this strong riposte in the game of bar- gaining power promptly engendered a countermove toward a still larger solidarity among unions as a whole. Several of them passed resolutions to support the United Steel Workers in their strike, and the AFL-CIO and several individual unions not only gave unequivocal moral support but also voted substantial cash subsidies to increase the defensive power of the United Steel Workers. Do we not here see the race for countervailing power generating a trend toward cartelization of industry by the back door that we have persistently turned back at the front door under our antitrust prin- ciple? Whether or not the Department of Justice will challenge this development remains to be seen. Thus far the monolithic labor suze- rainty has been able to maintain substantial immunity from the anti- trust laws. Something radical or at least showing sparks of inventive- ness now needs to be done to check the erosion of that competitive flexi- bility that is essential for an enterprise economy to deal with real op- erative situations. Our traditional theories of competition were developed long before these modern complexities had emerged. Edward Chamberlin's pioneer study of monopolistic competition took a long stride forward into the realities of today's commercial and industrial life. But the focus was on maximization of the profits of the business firm. There needs to be --and to some extent there has been-an enlargement or elevation of this type of theory to encompass maximization of the productivity and distributive dynamism of the whole economy. Public inquiries and pri- vate studies are now vigorously under way (notably those sponsored by the Joint Economic Committee and the Senate Subcommittee on Antitrust and Monopoly) to see if we can arrive at some actionable consensus as to what concentrations of economic power now permitted by law and administrative rulings are inimical to the intentions ex- pressed in the Employment Act, and what steps we should take to vali- date those intentions. Never before has the practicing economist been vouchsafed so adequate and competent a body of analytical and em- pirical material for his professional synthesis. We should now be near a break-through on both the juristic and the educational front. III Both the analyses of economists and the attitudes of the business world and general public divide rather clearly into two broad schools of thought as to the market phase of our current national economic problem. On the one hand are the radicals or pessimists, who despair of getting really full employment and avoiding inflation without super-</page><page sequence="6">PROBLEM OF FULL EMPLOYMENT 135 seding the free market or substantially limiting the present scope of freedom in the product, labor, and money markets. They would re- sort to extensive price, wage, and interest rate controls. This defeatist position seems to me premature, though it follows not unnaturally on the heels of disenchantment with the oversimplified belief that the pur- poses of the Employment Act were to be achieved through the wonder drugs of fiscal and monetary policy alone. It reflects an impatience with the slow and difficult process of progressively improving our market institutions in the light of larger experience and changing conditions and of progressively improving the performance of private administra- tive agencies in those markets in the light of research and a broadening viewpoint. The proponents of price and wage controls look for quick and decisive results from resort to centralized decision making. But such short cuts lead seductively to a fully authoritarian system. Experience with OPA, OPS, AAA, and indeed even much of public utility regulation seems to me to furnish ample evidence of both the theoretical shortcomings and the administrative difficulties of govern- ment control in the market process. No comprehensive rule book of price setting can be devised in advance by even the most competent team of market experts and economic professionals. However well con- ceived are the prices initially set at strategic spots, they impose unfore- seen disturbances on major and minor commercial relationships. These immediately clamor for compensating adjustments. Control of the price structure creates demand for control of the processes of production and distribution. (See the rake's progress of agricultural "adjustment" acts.) Hope that market controls can be rationalized under a few broad principles or limited to a few strategic points proves illusory, and the system rapidly bogs down in a morass of detailed regulations, excep- tions, grievances, and evasions. As for a stand-by apparatus, it is sure to grow costly during periods of inaction and be found obsolete when need for action arises. The milder proposal that intended new prices or rates be posted and then held in abeyance while the public scrutinizes their justification and impact nominally substitutes the intellectual approach for the power approach to economic adjustment. But those whose critical judgment would be competent in the appraisal of proposed action cannot in any real and important instances become adequately informed as to the complex factors involved. The mere form of the price or wage proposal and the conditions of compliance present insuperable practical diffi- culties. If the steel companies were to make such an advance declara- tion of intention, it would not be sufficient for them to state a single price on basic steel because there are many grades and types of steel and specifications as to "extras" fabrications, terms of sale and de-</page><page sequence="7">136 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION livery, and the like. These could not all be set out in the price proposal, and whatever base price was finally set by the company in the light of public reaction could be materially modified in application through skillful manipulation of these escape possibilities. Similarly in the case of automobiles, is it conceivable that the companies could, months in advance of the introduction of a new model, ilnform the amateur public and enlighten their professional rivals as to the precise character of vehicle to which any specific price was to apply? The companies them- selves are, up to the last moment of announcing the new models, un- certain as to what prices they can, must, or will name. The labor aspect of the notice-and-waiting proposal is in some ways simpler than the price aspect. But witlh all the skill differentials, senior- ity rights, fringe benefits, and grievance procedures by which the basic hourly rate is intertwined, the practical use of this approach to wag,es (and work rules) seems slight. Nor does recent experience in the steel impasse encourage the hope that either management or labor would be responsive to public opinion even if it could be captured, measured, and weighed as to its internal variations. But there is a more fundamental theoretical reason for eschewing the idea of a change of venue from the market to the governmenlt regu- latory agency. The underlying premise on which the proponents of gov- ernment intervention must rely is that the official price-maker possesses a magic touchstone for the performance of this task, whereas such prescience is not available to private price setters or price negotiators. The first of these premises, in my judgment, constitutes an overesti- mate, the latter an underestimate. The plea for radical government regulation was presented vigorously before this Association a year ago by Ben Lewis. Burlesquing the eco- nomic sophistication required, and in considerable measure attained, by some executives of big business units, as "corporate conscience ... marinated in goodness . .. as benevolent individuals construe goodness," he laid down the dictum that such managerial policy making "has nothing to do with economizing"; i.e., getting good allocation of pro- ductive resources: It is neither the privilege nor the responsibility of any individual, however conscientious or statesmanlike, voluntarily to render economizing decisions in the name of society. Economizing is society's job. . . . Economic decisions must be right as society measures right. . . . An economy is a mechanism designed to pick up and discharge the wishes of society in the management of its resources. Sometimes we seek through government to make the market itself operate more effectively as an economizing instrument; sometimes we move positively into the market with our sleeves rolled up and force the economic verdicts which, collectively, we want. . .. Through government we supplement the market; we also supplant the market. . . . The years ahead will see a great ilncrease in conscious, collective, governmental controls and of governmental enterprise. . .. The conviction that great power over the economy must reside only in a government of the people will be acted on relentlessly, bluntly, and with force.</page><page sequence="8">PROBLEM OF FULL EMPLOYMENT 137 Passing over Lewis' fast semantic shuffle between "society," "the economy," and "government" and the socialist implication of his pre- diction, I find myself in considerable disagreement with his dichotomy between big business purblind to what the public wants by way of al- location of resources and big government suffused with full under- standing of these wants, full wisdom in resolving conflicts among them, and an adequate apparatus for implementing its "right" answers. The anthropomorphic idea that either society or government can know, discover, or formulate "the public interest" is a figment of the imagina- tion since "society" does not and cannot have an official spokesman, and the officials of government bring their own limited empirical knowl- edge and very considerable personal biases and special-interest affilia- tions into their vocation as policy makers. Congressional action is not based merely on honest debate among informed statesmen; it also re- flects ruthless pressures of interest groups and sordid trades among "practical" politicians. This voice of the people is in only the most Pickwickian sense the voice of God. Though it is the only workable alternative to authoritarianism that democracy has found for the shap- ing of fiscal policy and the institutional framework of the market, it is thoroughly unacceptable as a substitute for profit-seeking, responsi- ble, ad hoc decision making of and within business firms and labor unions. IV If, then, we reject the deceptively simple device of cutting the Gordian knot of our full employment versus inflation dilemma by the use of direct government price and wage controls, what positive pro- gram can we adopt? My answer to this challenge begins with a caveat. Zeal in attacking the problem of linking maximum production with dollar stability should be tempered with careful discrimination. "As prudent men we should not take hasty steps to alter an institutional system so deeply grounded in our traditions and so successful in meet- ing immediate postwar demands and opportunities. At the same time we should not be tardy in taking well considered steps toward correct- ing such deep-lying or slowly developed shortcomings as time has re- vealed in our modern system of free but highly organized industrial- ism."3 Within such an interpretation of the needful role of the federal gov- ernment in the private market, our positive program should be a vig- orous implementation of the policy explicitly stated in the Employment Act; namely, "to foster and promote free competitive enterprise." This clause was not a mere political gesture toward threadbare tradition, but Excerpted from the writer's testimony before the Senate Subcommittee on Antitrust and Monopoly Hearings on Administered Prices, Pt. I, p. 13, July 9, 1957.</page><page sequence="9">138 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION rather was a correct reflection of a basic principle of American and Western European economic science-that free competition among the complex thrusts of supply forces and the diverse pulls of demand forces furnishes the optimum condition for attaining maximum productive use of the economy's resources and maximum consumer satisfactions. Four ingredients of a free enterprise program seem to me to be indicated: (1) integration of our sprawling and confused antitrust statutes under a basic policy law or Joint Resolution that declares a comprehensive principle of free competitive enterprise; (2) pressure for vigorous and consistent enforcement of this principle both through the Department of Justice and also the ancillary agencies of the Federal Trade Com- mission, the National Labor Relations Board, the Secretary of Agri- culture (Capper-Volstead and Marketing Agreements Acts), and sev- eral independent commissions; (3) realistic studies by the economics profession of the fundamental theory of large-scale competition, and the use of this enlarged understanding for the guidance of courts in applying general statutes to particular situations; of Congress and of administrative agencies in perfecting our competitive institutions and current practice under them; and (4) systematic but nonpropaganda campaigns of general education of the various functionaries and the general public in the operative requirement of a free competitive eco- nomic system. The integration of a consistent and comprehensive procompetition legal structure should begin with a clear-cut declaration that all parties and interest groups shall stand equal before the law of the land, that no segment of the economy-industrial, commercial, agricultural, labor, or financial-shall be immune from safeguards set up to prevent the abuse of concentrated economic power. This unification of our institu- tions of big-unit competition would then require careful re-examination of our many special regulatory laws to see that their provisions are in strict conformity with the general declaration of policy as well as rec- ognizing the operative needs and peculiarities of the several business areas. Even so, the definitions and rules embodied in these special statutes can hardly be more than a skeleton of generalized statements of principle and intent which must have flesh put on its bones by en- forcement authorities-who must exercise a considerable margin of discretion in interpreting a given state of facts in a complex and chang- ing economy and in aligning regulatory action with declared policy. To say this emphasizes the close interrelationship among all four of the ingredients I have proposed. For the selection of cases to be ex- amined and acted upon by the Department of Justice or the independ- ent commissions and the findings made by them must be guided by economic analysis as much as by legal technicalities or by ease of han- dling or prospect of a successful outcome. It is cause for congratulation</page><page sequence="10">PROBLEM OF FULL EMPLOYMENT 139 that there are today a considerable number of professionally competent economists in the staffs of these several agencies, that they draw upon the skills of brother economists in academic and business connections, and that the variegated wisdom of all three groups is made available to our lawmakers and amenders through the intellectualized apparatus that has been introduced into our Congressional system-and that is still growing. This is all the more important because so many vital questions of both corporation and labor practice are still in so am- biguous and indeterrninate a state. We do not have any economic pope who is in a position to give us an infallible answer, for instance, as to the competitive or noncompetitive impact of conglomerate mergers or the lush proliferation of big com- panies into lines related only remotely if at all to the company's original business. Similarly on the labor side, it appears that outlawing the na- tional wage contract would be found highly disadvantageous by some employers and a statutory "right to work" inequitable by many workers. Until we have something more closely approaching scientific demonstration in numerous cloudy areas, we will do well to limit the law to statements of principle and purpose and rely on judicial or quasi-judicial procedures to articulate declared policy with ad hoc puzzlement. In discharging this vital role, some courts now avail them- selves of economic counsel in balance with their use of legal counsel; others prefer, in the bright blue yonder of the economic stratosphere, to "fly by the seat of their juridical pants." While my emphasis on the usefulness of the economist as expert wit- ness in litigation and as staff member or consultant in the legislative area may seem to be in the nature of a commercial for our craft, in fact it is a sober challenge to us to foreswear a good deal of academic boon-doggling in the name of research and come up with some illumi- nating answers or at least well-grounded and stimulating hypotheses as to the nature and potentialities for both good and harm of price and non-price competition between large economic units and some inventive proposals for capturing the benefits and avoiding the abuses of such massing of private power.4 'But even under the institutions we now have and with the understandings we have already gained, we should be able to recognize and act upon a few extreme situations where concentrations of economic power are so massive-and still growing-that govern- ment should proceed actively, not merely to check, but to reverse them. On the corporate side, I would nominate the General Motors Corporation; on the labor side, the Teamsters Union (quite outside the issues of shady practices now under attack). Exemplary action in each of these extreme cases would not only serve as a warning to others who have not yet stretched so far the tolerances of our free enterprise doctrine. And, even more signifi- cantly, the size and importance of these cases would assure such thorough discovery proceedings and such appeal to economic analysis by outstanding experts by both prosecu- tion and defense as would define national policy over the whole area and for a considera- ble time into the future. The logic of action in the two cases is not identical, but it is equally compelling-though it is not possible to elaborate it here.</page><page sequence="11">140 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION V In thus seeking to devise a model of privately administered price- making and wage negotiation compatible with the purposes of the Em- ployment Act, can we discover any hard core of theory as to the basic lnature of our problem which might furnish theoretical keys to its solu- tion? I venture to suggest two hypotheses. First, I am persuaded that a basic reason why an irresistible force of union cravings meets an immovable body of managerial prerogative is that the scope of decision making on wages and work rules has become too wide and its situs too far removed from the core issues that need to be resolved. This proposition, however, must not be mistaken as the preinise for a sweeping proposal for corporation-busting or union-bust- ing; it simply points to a discriminating realignment of functions. The issue as to centralization versus decentralization in the private hemi- sphere of our economy runs closely in parallel with the same issue in the public hemisphere. While certain functions such as defense, inter- national relations, and fiscal policy must be and remain the functions of government, in the great body of operational matters, both civil and criminal, we find it better to let local autonomy decide upon patterns of life which free citizens find best adapted to their peculiar circum- stances and values. They may invent, experiment, learn by doing, and profit by the experience of other autonomous groups. Similarly, certain financial and related investment and technological policies of the modern corporation can most efficiently be centrally determined. Wage bar- gains and detailed work rules seem to me to fall in a distinguishably different category and to call for serious effort by all parties to dis- cover principles and shape practices of local autonomy that would pro- mote serviceable reconcilement of conflicting alternatives on both sides rather than creating a widespread, even national, impasse by trying to extend a single formula to quite unlike situations. Instead of the sort of centralization marked by the intrusion of AFL-CIO and its Indus- trial Union Department and by the industry-wide coalescence of major companies in the national wage bargaining which tied up the steel in- dustry and the economy, we need more flexible differentiation of local situations and variety of accommodation through initiative, experimen- tation, and natural selection. Of course any such suggestion will be greeted by the union hierarchy as a proposal to "weaken the unions" and evoke the real, and in its time, legitimate dread of the "company union." But note that I am not proposing the abolition of the national union or the multi-union federa- tion-simply a restoration of powers of choice lost to the operational groups through the growth of union hierarchies. The national union will</page><page sequence="12">PROBLEM OF FULL EMPLOYMENT 141 still have a centralized role of general policy making, promotion, and enterprise leadership-including legitimate lobbying. It may formulate general policies as to work rules (as it now does) and propose wage levels and differentials, but with these tailored by the local to its own peculiar (environmental) conditions, and state of the employing com- pany (as textile workers have done). The main point is that any strike vote shall be taken independently for itself by each union without constraint by others. This would not be a departure from practices which now obtain sporadically within the union movement, but would regularize and generalize the principle and would allow "the show to go on," recognize difference in operational requirements, assure self- determined values, and raise the dignity of local leadership. It would not have to rubber stamp central policy or seek promotion to the na- tional hierarchy via such subservience. Union members who have felt they had to support the national leaders even in an "unpopular" strike might ponder whether their own interests would not be served better by contributing to the making of differentiated adjustments than by accepting authoritarian decisions. Note, too, that my proposal includes a similar restitution of powers of decision making by the centralized corporation to its component operating units. This diagnosis is not based on the negative proposition that bigness must always suffer from bureaucratization, but on the positive concept of economic statesmanship and promotion of the common good, about which there is such ambiguity. Much as officials of the national govern- ment should and, to a not always recognized extent, do have a national or statesmanlike outlook even amidst the practical necessities of re- flecting local and interest-group pressures, so top executives of national corporations and top officers of national unions have a similar oppor- tunity (and duty) to learn of the national process within which their management must function and of practicing two-way statesmanship: backward for the enlightenment of their constituent parts and forward to the enlightenment of government agencies as to the needs and re- sponse of their "factor" group and its underlying parts. A second impediment in the path of fundamentally workable adjust- ments is the refusal of management almost universally to admit that the price of product (in its relation to volume of sales, number of jobs, and rate of profits) should be considered as an integral part of the wage problem. If management were to admit the functional inseparability of these issues, it should expect labor similarly to treat wages in their relation to volume of employment, productivity, and actual rather than formulated living costs. This issue goes to the very heart of the pro- posals currently being made in various forms for dealing with labor-</page><page sequence="13">142 AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION management deadlocks by means of "fact-finding" committees, com- pulsory arbitration, Presidential pressure for some "recommended" terms of settlement, or legislation providing for "a third chair [the public's] at the bargaining table." The simple fact is that corporation orthodoxy clings to the huckstering philosophy of early proprietary capitalism even in our new day of trustee capitalism. The progress of science and engineering has, in the area of technology, eroded the prov- ince of "trade secrets" almost to the vanishing point, and industrial ex- ecutives have found that patent licensing is a practicable way of com- petitive life. We now need a counterpart development under which ra- tional determination of critical cases within the price-income process could be approached by arraying the pertinent factual material and applying to it the best of professional expertise (with such fruitful variants of interpretation as economists would offer-even as scientists and engineers do). In a word, our society is now laboring under a serious cultural lag, and will continue to do so until we can bring ourselves to substitute scientific method for "muscle" in the conduct of big-unit industrialism. VI In the fourteen years since the war we have demonstrated only a very precarious kind of control over the built-in or institutionalized inflation that has evolved and only dubious and adventitious capability for full and sustained use of our national resources for produLction. We are now, very properly, probing into a variety of local and more or less discrete manifestations of this unsatisfactory performance, in the hope of im- proving economic structures and elevating economic practice. Along with these activities, and as a guide to them, we should also ponder deeply what are the over-all implications of the maximum production policy or doctrine to which we give lip service. Both Sir William Bever- idge as the British prophet Isaiah of the full employment gospel and Alvin Hansen as its American John the Baptist stated the postulates in quite explicit terms.5 These prerequisites were: widespread economic sophistication and a pervasive spirit of social cohesiveness or national unity. Reverting to Hansen's comment that, in terms of economic sophisti- cation and social unity, we were, in 1947, "out of the kindergarten but still have a long way to go," what can be said of progress made since 'Beveridge stipulated "a coordinated attempt, not a blind groping and pressing by numerous groups each of which sees only its own sectional interest and tries to exploit its particular strategic advantage"; voluntary arbitration of wage disputes; and both prices and wages "determined by reason, in the light of all the facts [employers opening their books to public scrutiny] and with some regard to general equities." Hansen gave us the admirable generalizations already quoted: "a balanced wage-and-price policy and, above all, social unity and cohesiveness."</page><page sequence="14">PROBLEM OF FULL EMPLOYMENT 143 then? The record seems to me to be seriously disquieting. The most charitable estimate is that we have moved on to the stage of teenage turmoil, with its undisciplined aggressiveness, adolescent frustrations, and intellectual confusions. There was a flash of economic insight in the steel companies' statement of the need to get the cost-price mechan- isin under control if we are to attain a competitive stance in world mar- kets and competitive dynamism amonag domestic industries. But there was egregious economic stupidity (and even business stupidity) in their bland assumption that price and profit factors should be imnmune from any part in the readjustment process, while wages and volume of em- ployment took the full brunt. There was a flash of economic perspicacity -even precociousness-in the argument of the vice-president of AFL- CIO that our basic problem is that of "learning how to distribute abun- dance" and in his reasoning that wages cannot be adequately analyzed -and adjusted-in isolation from price and profit information and analysis. But I do not find equal or even minimal grasp of the global economic process in his supposition that money wages can be advanced by larger and larger amounts on each contract renewal date, that those with the highest rates should get the largest new gains, and that each of the leaders get more than any of the other front runners. I have already stressed the responsibility of our profession to provide clearer analyses of the complex problems of this real world and more cogent and practical proposals for positive devices for meeting them. But a means of selling as well as producing such intellectual merchan- dise is needed. This over-all factor or condition necessary to the success- ful practice of economic democracy is referred to by its proponents as the educational approach or "intellectualism on the economic front." It is tagged by its detractors as the hortatory approach, admonition, or the "jawbone attack." Only at our peril do we sneer at "creeping ad- monitionism" and declare that "statesmanship is for the statesmen" and thus that private statesmanship; is "for the birds"-even in the day of multi-billion-dollar corporations and multi-million-member unions and the still more powerful solidarities of both. It should be remembered that admonition is an art widely practiced by many who ridicule it when practiced by the professor or by the President.
