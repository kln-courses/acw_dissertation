Author for correspondence (meyersst@science.oregonstate.edu) Communicating Editor: Daniel Potter Abstract - In an effort to further resolve relationships within the genus Limnanthes and the family Limnanthaceae a phylogenetic study was conducted using one nuclear (nrlTS) and two chloroplast (trnL intron and trnS-trnG intergenic spacer) genes. In addition to surveying all cur- rently accepted taxa within Limnanthaceae, an anomalous population of 4-petalous plants from Half Moon Bay, San Mateo County, California, was also included. Further, a series of crossing experiments were performed between Half Moon Bay plants and two closely related species (Limnanthes bakeri and L. macounii). The results of this study confirm the monophyly of two sections within Limnanthes and also suggest that Limnanthaceae may contain as few as four species of Limnanthes and the monotypic genus Floerkea proserpinacoides. Additionally, the molecular phylogenetic results and crossing experiments do not support taxonomic recognition of the Half Moon Bay population, rather it is part of a highly polymorphic Limnanthes douglasii sensu lato. Keywords - Floerkea, Half Moon Bay, Limnanthes. Limnanthaceae is a small family of annual herbs and the only vascular plant family endemic to temperate North America. The phylogenetic position of the family has long been debated, but it is now confidently placed in the order Brassicales (Rodman et al. 1998). Taxonomists currently rec- ognize two genera. Floerkea Willd. is a monotypic genus of 3-petalous plants that inhabits seasonally wet, often for- ested microsites in eastern North America, the Great Basin- Intermountain region, and the Pacific Northwest. The second genus, Limnanthes R. Br., is considered to comprise eight species, three of which are further divided into 4-5 sub- species. With the exception of the 4-petaled and Vancouver Island, British Columbia species L. macounii, all recognized Limnanthes species are 5-petalous and found within the California Floristic Province, where they occur in vernal pool habitats, or occasionally in seasonally wet grasslands (Fig. 1). During years of favorable weather, large populations of some white-flowered Limnanthes species give the appearance of meadows covered with "foam," thus the common name of the genus, meadowfoam. Of the 20 currently recognized taxa within Limnanthaceae, eight are of interest due to conservation concerns. Limnanthes vinculans, L. fioccosa ssp. californica and L. fioccosa ssp. grandi- flora are listed as endangered by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service; ssp. grandiflora is also listed by the state of Oregon. Although not federally listed, L. douglasii ssp. sulphurea and L. alba ssp. parishii are considered endangered and L. bakeri as rare by the state of California. In addition, in the state of Oregon, both L.floccosa ssp. bellingeriana and L. alba ssp. graci- lis are currently candidate species for listing under state law. All members of Limnanthes are of particular interest due to the usefulness of the oil produced from their seeds. Unlike most plants, meadowfoam species produce a long chain seed oil with novel physical and chemical characteristics, making it extremely stable at high temperatures and pressures (Miller et al.1964; Isbell 1997). A few Limnanthes alba cultivars are currently grown on a limited scale in the United States, mainly in the state of Oregon, where they have potential as a rotation crop in tandem with grass seed production. Only bee- pollinated L. alba cultivars are grown because the seed yield and seed oil concentration is highest in this species, as opposed to self-pollinating Limnanthes species, which have low seed yield and oil concentration. Growth of the meadowfoam oil industry has been impeded because L. alba often exhibits low and erratic seed yields due to its dependence on insect pollination. While Limnanthes pollination can be disturbed by cool, wet, windy weather (Ricker 2005), the largest and most recent impediment to suc- cessful bee pollination is Colony Collapse Disorder. This dis- ease, of unknown cause, has affected approximately 30% of bee colonies in the United States (Watanabe 2008) and greatly increased the maintenance costs of those beehives not affected (Oldroyd 2007). Considering the problems associated with seed crop pro- duction based on obligate outcrossing, the development of self-pollinating Limnanthes cultivars with oil-rich seeds is an obvious priority. Initial attempts to accomplish this have involved controlled crosses between L. alba and the autoga- mous taxon L. fioccosa ssp. grandiflora. While this cross did result in a fertile hybrid, the cultivar still required bee pollina- tion (Dole and Sun 1992; Knapp and Crane 1999). Future attempts to breed a viable, selfing Limnanthes cul- tivar, with a high seed oil content, may benefit from a more thorough understanding of the biological and phylogenetic relationships within Limnanthaceae. Additionally, conserva- tion efforts may be aided by a more thorough understanding of relationships within and among the taxa of this family. Several systematic studies of Limnanthaceae and Limnan- thes have been completed by previous authors. However, these authors have disagreed as to the placement of many taxa within the family. When Limnanthaceae was described in 1833 by Brown he separated Floerkea from Limnanthes. He did so with some reluctance, noting that apart from the 3-petalous morphology of Floerkea (versus the 5-petalous morphology of all but one Limnanthes species) the two gen- era are very similar. Later in the 19th and early 20th centuries some workers (Bâillon 1871; Greene 1891; Gray 1897) merged the two genera, while others (Macoun 1886; Howell 1897; Rydberg 1907) followed Brown's original treatment. A comprehensive biosystematic study of Limnanthaceae was conducted by Mason (1952) using plant morphol- ogy, chromosome morphology, meiotic configurations, and crossing studies. Based on morphology Mason separated Limnanthes from the genus Floerkea. Mason also subdivided Limnanthes into two sections: Reflexae and Inflexae, based on petal position during the maturation of the nutlets.

Additionally, Mason concluded that L. gracilis var. parishii, formerly named a variety of L. versicolor (currently L. ß/frfl ssp. versicolor) by Jepson (1936), should be considered a variety of L. gracilis. Mason also suggested that L. gracilis var. gracilis, L. gracilis var. parishii, and L. montana may have a close relationship. Lastly, although Mason observed that most L. a/fro var. versicolor populations exhibited some L. alba var. ß/frfl characteristics, he chose to recognize the two varieties as distinct taxa. Two subsequent studies, using phenetic analysis of floral characters (Ornduff and Cro vello 1968) and crossing experiments (Ornduff 1971), respectively, found concordance with the classification of Mason (1952). It should be noted that according to current nomenclatural priority rules, established by International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (McNeill et al. 2006), section Reflexae should be referred to as section Limnanthes. In 1973 Arroyo, using numerical taxonomy, studied the infraspecific phenetic relationships within L. fioccosa. She elevated the varieties within L. fioccosa to subspecies and described an additional subspecies, i.e. L. /. ssp. grandiflora. The author also concluded that L. /. ssp. californica is a recent derivative of L. alba and all other subspecies of L. fioccosa rep- resent a progressive evolution from L.fi ssp. californica. Arroyo also postulated that L. /. ssp. bellingeriana is most likely poly- phyletic, having been derived from L. /. ssp. fioccosa on mul- tiple and separate occasions. Next, Parker and Böhm (1979) conducted a study to clarify relationships within Limnanthaceae using petal and whole- plant flavonoids and plant morphological characters. While the petal flavonoids supported Mason's 1952 classification, the whole-plant flavonoids indicated differently. Citing their whole-plant flavonoid results and plant morphological char- acters, the authors concluded that Limnanthes and Floerkea should be combined into one genus. The authors offered no other conclusions or suggestions about any other relation- ships within Limnanthaceae or Limnanthes. Using allozyme variation, McNeill and Jain (1983) con- ducted a study of Limnanthes section Inflexae. They agreed</page><page sequence="3">554 SYSTEMATIC BOTANY [Volume 35 with Arroyo (1973) that L.f. ssp. bellingeriana is likely derived from L.f. ssp. fioccosa, but disagreed with her conclusion that L /. ssp. californica is derived from L. alba, and likewise dis- puted that the other subspecies of L. fioccosa are derived from L.f ssp. californica. According to this study's results, L. fioccosa is not closely related to L. alba, nor to any other Limnanthes species in section Inflexae. McNeill and Jain hypothesized that L. fioccosa may have originated from an unknown taxon or diverged very rapidly. In addition, the authors concluded that both L. alba subspecies and the two L. gracilis subspecies are closely related, while L. montana is only distantly related. Again using allozyme data, Kesseli and Jain (1984) assessed the phylogeny of section Limnanthes. These authors found that specimens of subspecies within L. douglasii, as well as specimens analyzed within L. striata, formed clusters based on geographic distribution rather than taxonomy. Plotkin (1998) conducted the first molecular phyloge- netic study using DNA sequence data, specifically one nuclear (nrlTS) and one chloroplast locus (trnL intron). He sampled one specimen each from all described taxa within Limnanthaceae with the exception of L. gracilis ssp. parishii. Plotkin concluded that Floerkea and Limnanthes should be maintained as distinct taxa. Additionally, his data suggested that L. gracilis ssp. gracilis and L. striata might be treated as subspecies of L. alba and L. douglasii, respectively. Based on this, Morin (2007) subsequently merged the two L. gracilis subspecies within L. alba and demoted L. striata to a subspe- cies within L. douglasii. Unfortunately, Plotkin's work is only available as an unpublished thesis and his sequences are not deposited in GenBank. Lastly, Donnelly et al. (2008) evaluated 62 Limnanthes acces- sions, representing seven species, using 15 simple sequence repeat markers. While the results of their parsimony analysis separated the accessions into the two sections proposed by Mason (1952), there was little resolution within either of the groups. In an effort to further resolve systematic relationships within Limnanthes, and build upon previous studies, we have reconstructed a molecular phylogeny using one nuclear gene (nrlTS) and two chloroplast loci (the trnL intron and trnS- trnG intergenic spacer). In addition to sampling all currently accepted taxa of Limnanthaceae, we included in our analysis an anomalous population of 4-petalous plants, discovered in 1998 (Buxton and Ornduff 1999), which is known only from a cultivated Brussels sprout field in Half Moon Bay, San Mateo County, California. We will refer to this population as "Half Moon Bay". As noted above, the only 4-petalous species of Limnanthes is L. macounii, generally considered an endemic of Vancouver Island, British Columbia. However, 4-petalous individuals have been rarely observed in both Floerkea and other Limnanthes species (Bâillon 1871, 1878). Recently, representatives of the California Native Plant Society and the California Natural Diversity Database, the latter a program affiliated with the California Department of Fish and Game, have proposed official recognition of the Half Moon Bay population (Jensen and Bittman, unpub- lished report). The proposal suggests that the population should be recognized as L. macounii or an undescribed taxon. Furthermore, unless additional studies conclude this popu- lation is normative to California, it should be placed on the CNPS 1B.1 list and the CNDDB G2/S1 list. The 1B.1 sta- tus would designate the population as "rare throughout its range" and "seriously threatened in California". The G2/S1 status would indicate that population is "critically imperiled, at very high risk of extinction due to extreme rarity (often 5 or fewer populations), very steep declines, or other factors" (CDFG 2009). In addition to its inclusion in the molecular phylogenetic analysis, we also performed a series of crosses between "Half Moon Bay" individuals and individuals of L. macounii and L. bakeri, grown from seed, in a greenhouse study. The latter species was chosen as a representative of section Limnanthes. Resulting seeds were germinated and Fl individuals were grown to maturity. The morphology and flowering phenol- ogy of the latter were contrasted with the parental species. The results of this study confirm the monophyly of the two sections within Limnanthes and also suggest that Limnan- thaceae may contain only four species of Limnanthes and the monotypic genus Floerkea proserpinacoides. Furthermore, the molecular phylogenetic and crossing experiments do not sup- port taxonomic recognition of the "Half Moon Bay" population. Materials and Methods With the exception of rare taxa that inhabit a small geographic range (L alba ssp. parishii, L. bakeri, L. douglasii ssp. sulphurea, L. macounii, L vin- culans and the "Half Moon Bay" population) and L. montana, all taxa were sampled at least twice from locations geographically distant from one another. To estimate a phylogeny, we used 1,863 base pair (bp) of DNA (nrlTS, 679 bp; trnL intron 413 bp; trnS-trnG, 771 bp) sequenced from 31 speci- mens. DNA was obtained from fresh plant material and dried herbar- ium specimens (Appendix 1). The sequence alignment is deposited in TreeBASE (study number S2570). Germplasm accessions obtained from the Arid Land Plant Genetic Resources Unit were germinated following Toy and Willingham (1966). Seedlings were grown in a greenhouse until maturity and keyed using Ornduff (1993) to confirm their taxonomic identity. Vouchers were placed in the Oregon State University Herbarium (OSC). Approximately 50 mg of plant material was used to extract DNA using a DNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, California). All primers were obtained from and amplified following the proto- cols of Shaw et al. (2005), Taberlet et al. (1991), and Liston et al. (1996). Following PCR, all products were purified using QIAquick PCR purifi- cation kits (Qiagen). Sequencing was performed by Northwoods DNA (Solway, Minnesota). Sequences were aligned "by eye" and analyzed using BioEdit for Windows 95/98 (Hall 1999). Gaps were scored as miss- ing data. To test whether individual chloroplast and nrlTS trees should be combined, and whether topologies amongst the trees were significantly different, Kishino-Hasegawa and Shimodaira-Hasegawa tests (Kishino and Hasegawa 1989; Shimodaira and Hasegawa 1999) using PAUP* were employed. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using PAUP* version 4blO (Swofford 2002), RAxML (Stamatakis et al. 2008) and MrBayes version 3.1.2 (Ronquist and Huelsenbeck 2003). For individual and combined sequences, most parsimonious trees were found using branch and bound maximum parsimony (MP) searches within PAUP*, employing the furthest addition sequence setting and MulTrees on. Gaps were scored as missing data. Branch support was assessed using 1,000 bootstrap replicates. Modeltest 3.7 (Posada and Crandall 1998) was used to select the evolutionary model that best fit each dataset. A general-time-reversible model incorporating a gamma (GTR + gamma) distribution of among site rate variation was selected for the nrlTS and trnS-trnG dataseis and an F81 model for the trnL dataset. These models were set for all Bayesian searches, while a GTR + gamma model was set for the RAxML search. Bayesian searches were conducted in one run using one cold and three heated Markov Chains, over two million generations, sampling every 100 generations. All trees generated within the burn-in period (2,000) were discarded and posterior probability confidence values were based only on trees found in the stationary phase. Stationery was measured using a comparison of log-likelihood values. Initially, Arabidopsis thaliana served as the outgroup taxon for all phy- logenetic analyses using sequences obtained from GenBank (AP000423; X52320). However, within the order Brassicales, Limnanthaceae is only distantly related to other families, including Brassicaceae (Rodman et al.</page><page sequence="4">2010] MEYERS ET AL.: PHYLOGENY OF LIMNANTHACEAE 555 1998). As a result, A. thaliana was not a suitable outgroup taxon. In sub- sequent phylogenetic analyses, Floerkea proserpinacoides was used as the outgroup taxon. Twenty individuals of "Half Moon Bay" plants were each crossed with twenty individuals each of L. bakeri and L. macounii. In one half of the crosses the "Half Moon Bay" plants served as the maternal parent, with the remaining plants paternal. Maternal plants were emasculated prior to hand pollination, in an effort to prevent self pollination. All resulting nutlets were dried at room temperature for a period of 12 wk before they were germinated as described above. Flowering phenology was measured as days from germination to initial anthesis. Results The Kishino-Hasegawa and Shimodaira-Hasegawa tests found no conflict between the separate chloroplast and nrlTS dataseis (p = 0.32-1.0). Additionally, the combined MP strict consensus, RAxML (neither shown) and Bayesian majority rule consensus (Fig. 2) trees shared identical topology. Both taxonomic sections Inflexae and Limnanthes comprise well-supported clades, with posterior probabilities of 1.0. Within section Inflexae, the accessions of L. alba form a well- supported monophyletic group, as do those of L. fioccosa. Within each of these species, however, specimens of the same subspecies are either not sister or fall within a polytomy. Within section Limnanthes, phylogenetic resolution is poor among the four recognized species. Furthermore, the poly- morphic L. douglasii is not monophyletic and its subspecies are intermingled with the sampled individuals of L. vincu- lans and L. macounii. There is no sequence divergence among four samples of two subspecies (L. douglasii ssp. nivea and ssp. rosea), while neither of two other subspecies (L. douglasii ssp. douglasii and ssp. striata) is resolved as monophyletic. Although morphologically similar, "Half Moon Bay" and L. macounii are not sister to one another: the former appears more closely related to some specimens of L. douglasii, while the position of the latter is not resolved. Of the 20 crosses between "Half Moon Bay" and L. bakeri, 15 resulted in successful seed set. Morphologically, the Fl prog- eny were nearly identical to L. bakeri, although many plants produced 4-petalous flowers morphologically intermediate to L. bakeri and "Half Moon Bay." Among the 20 crosses between "Half Moon Bay" and L. macounii, 11 resulted in successful seed set. These Fl progeny were morphologically identical to L. macounii, but flowered, on average, in 31 d (s. d. = 2.1). This is nearly identical to the flowering time of "Half Moon Bay" individuals (mean = 29 d, s. d. = 2.2) but two weeks before L. macounii plants (mean = 44 d, s. d. = 2.6). Discussion Phylogenetic Analysis - Based on the distant relationship of Floerkea to Limnanthes, revealed in our phylogenetic analy- sis (see comments above), we agree with previous workers Fig. 2.

As a result of the positions of L. fioccosa and L. alba, we agree with McNeill and Jain (1983) that L. fioc- cosa is not directly derived from L. alba, but our work does not exclude the possibility that their common ancestor may have exhibited L. alba morphology. Our findings also agree with McNeill and Jain that L. montana is distinct from L. alba ssp. gracilis and L. alba ssp. parishii (formerly subspecies of L. graci- lis), contrary to the hypothesis proposed by Mason (1952). Based on the position of L. alba ssp. gracilis and L. alba ssp. parishii within the clade that contains the two other L. alba subspecies, we also agree with the nomenclatural changes proposed by Morin (2007) in which she merges L. gracilis with L. alba. Additionally, the individuals of L. alba ssp. alba and L. alba ssp. versicolor sampled are nonmonophyletic. This provides support for the view that these two taxa should be merged, based on morphology, as suggested by Mason (1952). Unfortunately, due to low resolution within the L. fioccosa clade, we are unable to make any inferences concerning the evolutionary history of the L. fioccosa subspecies. However, we are currently seeking to resolve these questions using fur- ther hybridization experiments, nuclear microsatellite mark- ers, and whole chloroplast sequencing data. Within section Limnanthes, low support essentially places all species within a sectional-level polytomy. This differs slightly with findings of Plotkin (1998) who concluded that L. bakeri and L. vinculans were distinct taxa. Additionally, the L. douglasii subspecies sampled are either non-monophyletic (subspecies striata and douglasii) or placed within a polytomy (subspecies nivea and rosea). Although the two individuals of L. douglasii ssp. striata we sampled are in two separate clades, each of these clades con- tains other L. douglasii subspecies. Conservatively, however, we agree with Morin (2007), that unless and until further data are presented, providing greater resolution within the sec- tion Limnanthes, L. striata should be treated as a subspecies of L. douglasii. The lack of resolution among most Limnanthes species and subspecies may be the result of two factors: 1. The divergence of extant taxa within Limnanthes may have been a recent and rapid event. The ease with which plants of "Half Moon Bay" were successfully crossed with L. bakeri and L. macounii in this study, as well as successful intersectional crosses done by other workers (Mason 1952, Ornduff 1971), supports this hypothesis. If true, too few mutations have accu- mulated in the genes we have sampled or allelic coalescence has not yet occurred. These scenarios have been proposed as a source of potential molecular phylogenetic error for two decades (Pamilo and Nei 1988; Maddison 1997; Nichols 2001; Rosenberg 2002). 2. The current taxonomy of Limnanthes may be a poor reflection of the true evolutionary history of the genus. It is plausible, particularly within section Limnanthes, that one or all of the characters currently used to distinguish the various taxa (leaf shape, petal length, petal number and petal color) are merely polymorphic characters still segregating within a single species. We hypothesize that there may be only four species of Limnanthes (L. alba, L. fioccosa, L. montana, and L. douglasii), three of which (all except L. montana) are mor- phologically polymorphic. Although numerous subspecies are currently recognized, many of these are either nonmono- phyletic or undifferentiated from other subspecies, based on the current molecular sampling. However, any taxonomic changes are premature pending the sampling of complete chloroplast genomes (Cronn et al. 2008) and nuclear loci that will provide additional sequence data to test this hypothesis. Conservation Status of Limnanthes Taxa - As a result of anthropomorphic activities an estimated 60% of vernal pool habitats have been destroyed in Oregon, while in California estimates range as high as 90%. Of those pools remaining, less than 20% are considered intact. Additionally, growing human population numbers and climate change are expected to increase habitat loss in the future (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2004). Because of the current and likely future lim- its on the range and habitats available for Limnanthes species, any future work involving the merging of currently accepted Limnanthes taxa should not result in alterations of their conser- vation status. As a benefit to conservation work, the potential merging of Limnanthes taxa may result in a greater amount of genetic diversity available for restoration and assisted migra- tion efforts within more broadly circumscribed taxa. "Half Moon Bay" Population - Morphologically, the pop- ulation of Limnanthes found in Half Moon Bay closely resem- bles L. macounii. It was, therefore, a surprising result that the sample of this population does not have a sister relationship to the L. macounii sample used in our phylogenetic analysis. As described above, it may be part of a highly polymorphic L. douglasii sensu lato. Our finding of fertile crosses with L. bakeri and L. macounii (potentially part of L. douglasii sensu lato) is consistent with this conclusion, as intraspecific crosses in Limnanthes generally result in fertile progeny, while inter- specific crosses generally fail or result in sterile Fis (Mason 1952; Ornduff 1971). It is curious that a population of 4-petalous plants has been found only within one cultivated Brussels sprout field and nowhere else in California. Furthermore, the town of Half Moon Bay is located in a well botanized area less than 50 km from San Francisco, leading to previous speculation that the plants are a recent introduction of L. macounii (Buxton and Ornduff 1999). The closest documented L. douglasii ssp. doug- lasii populations occur 20 km to the east and 55 km to the north, respectively, and are separated by unsuitable habitat for Limnanthes. Thus this population could be the result of recent dispersal, but from L. douglasii and not L. macounii. Considering its close phylogenetic relationship with L. doug- lasii s. 1., we suggest that the Half Moon Bay population be treated as an ecologically interesting and morphologically diver- gent population of this polymorphic species.
