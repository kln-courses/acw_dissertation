<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews Gittinnen, Gotter und Gottessymbole: Neue Erkenntnisse zur Religionsgeschichte Kanaans und Israels aufgrund bislang unerschlossener ikonographischer Quellen, by Othmar Keel and Christoph Uehlinger. QD 134. Freiburg/Basel/Vienna: Herder, 1992. Pp. xiv + 526. DM 58. Apart from the recent two-volume history of the religion of Israel by Rainer Albertz, this packed study of iconographic and inscriptional remains from second- and first- millennium BCE Palestine is the most important contribution in a number of years to the study of the religion of Israel and its Canaanite or, more neutrally, Palestinian antecedents. The significance of Keel's work in collecting the visual remains from the ancient Near East at the Biblische Institut of the University of Fribourg and bringing them to bear on biblical texts and their interpretation has been well demonstrated through a spate of publications that he, together with colleagues and students, has put forth in the last two decades. The most comprehensive and far-reaching study to date is found in this volume. The argumentative main weight of the study is borne by over 600 figures or draw- ings of deities or deity symbols found on various artifacts, many published here for the first time. At the Biblische Institut, Keel and colleagues have assembled about 8,500 stamp seals of various sorts from Palestine, but the evidence presented here reaches far beyond that collection. The argument draws upon many more representations than those appearing in the book as the authors cite the archaeological literature exten- sively. The bibliography itself opens up a world of study. Significant for their method and for one's evaluation of it is that, unlike most of the studies of the deities of Palestine, the discussion here is based entirely upon artifacts that were found in Palestine itself. Further, the authors have sought to give careful attention to regional differences and diachronic modifications. The result is a highly nuanced and detailed presentation of the changing forms and manifestations of deities and their veneration in the two millennia BCE. The authors see their study as having to do with issues of concern to feminist theology, biblical research generally, and more specifically the study of the religion of Israel. The first of these has coincided with the discoveries at Kuntillet 'Ajrud to raise the question of whether the God of Israel had a consort and more indirectly the place of women in the cult of preexilic Israel as well as the general valuing of the ex- perience and existence of women in the notions of God in the Judaeo-Christian tradi- tion. The Kuntillet 'Ajrud discoveries have also forced upon us a greater attention to the origins and significance of monotheism. The more recent German scholarship in this area, as represented, for example, by B. Lang, E. A. Knauf, and M. Weippert, has tended to argue for a long-lasting polytheistic ethos in preexilic Israel, a part of which included a consort for Yahweh. Keel and Uehlinger are critical of this trend because of its generally theoretical and textual grounding without sufficient consideration of the material remains. Where that has been attempted, as, for example, by J. S. Holladay, insufficient attention has been given to seals, amulets, ivories, and the like. The study under review takes its primary cue from the work ofJ. Tigay (You Shall Have No Other Gods: Israelite Religion in the Light of Hebrew Inscriptions), which places the common opinion about a polytheistic Israel in serious question. Keel and Uehlinger argue that the visual depictions of deity often present a more complex picture of the veneration of deity than the purely textual approach. The book is arranged chronologically beginning with the Middle Bronze II B period 503</page><page sequence="2">Journal of Biblical Literature (1750-1550) where the data show a kind of balance of the sexes in the depiction of gods and goddesses. The "nude goddess,' who is goddess of plant and animal life, is prominent. In general, goddesses dominate, with a strong emphasis on their sex. But they interact with the storm god, who is more a fertility and vegetation figure in this era than a warrior deity, according to the authors, though some of the figures, e.g. No. 32, may reflect a warrior stance (contra Keel and Uehlinger). One important conclusion of this chapter is that the religious symbol system that consisted of standing stones, sacred trees, and sexually marked deities and rituals, which many see as typical of "the" Canaanite religion between 1500 and 500, may have been prominent and sig- nificant only in this MB IIB period, while existing only strongly modified or on the periphery in the following periods. In the Late Bronze Age, under heavy Egyptian influence -seen in this volume to be greater in general than often recognized - the storm god is seen more as warrior than bringer of fertility. The goddess appears primarily in the form of a tree, often flanked by animals, sometimes with military elements. She has a lesser status, as reflected in the exclusive use of terracotta for the goddess figurines while the male deity appears in metal forms. The goddess is also present more in the sphere of "private" family piety. The transition period of Iron I (1250/1150-1000) is marked by deities who are depicted in images of military domination and rule, the goddess, however, being represented almost entirely by the substitution symbol of the tree. In Iron II, which appropriately receives considerable attention, the authors see the recrudescence of some of the themes of Late Bronze Age iconography as well as new developments. The famed Taanach cult stand probably comes from a house cult venerating the god- dess Asherah. There is no Yahweh symbol on it. In general, anthropomorphic represen- tations of the deity take a back seat in this period and are found outside of Israel and Judah or on the periphery. The great new thing, particularly in Iron IIB (ca. 925-720/ 700), is the dominance of solar elements on seals and ivories. Solar determination seems to be more important than gender or male-female opposition. As others have recently argued, Keel and Uehlinger see this solar dimension as also strongly represented in the symbol system associated with Yahweh of Israel. With regard to the much-discussed and debated Kuntillet 'Ajrud and Khirbet el-Qom inscriptions, the authors see only Yahweh as the personal dispenser of bless- ing and protection. Where there is reference to "his asherah,' we have to do not with an anthropomorphically and personally conceived deity but with a cult symbol mediat- ing blessing in the form of the stylized tree. In other words, we do not have here an independently operating female deity or Yahweh consort but a symbolic reality sub- ordinated to Yahweh. With regard to these inscriptions as a whole, Keel and Uehlinger do not see any arguments there against the widespread monolatrous worship of Yahweh in Iron IIB, but do regard them as providing arguments against the assumption of a female consort at that time. The iconographic remains and the onomastica suggest that the goddess had no very great significance in the symbol system of Iron IIB. The analysis of these texts, and especially of the iconography on the pithoi from Kuntillet 'Ajrud, is extensive and fundamental to any future discussion. Their conclusions are surely on the right track and should have an impact upon future discussion about a presumed consort of Yahweh. The Iron IIC period, the century before the exile, sees the astralizing of the divine powers and also the return of Asherah in anthropomorphic form. She is represented 504</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews in the pillar figurines and seems to have played some part in family piety or house cults in Judah. There is also an indication of the rise of orthodoxy, reflected, for ex- ample, in the disappearance of images from the name seals. Iron III (587-450) is marked by a regionalizing of religious developments that is best seen in comparing the evidence from Judah and from Edom. In Judah, there is no place for a goddess alongside Yahweh, as there was a goddess alongside Qaus in Edom. The material in this book is far richer and more detailed than a review can sug- gest. The interpretive task is large enough with written remains and even more so with iconographic. But Keel and Uehlinger would argue that the mass of data collected here or alluded to speaks volumes to those who would listen and work to understand. Investigators of the religious developments, not only in Israel, but in Palestine in general will find in this volume an unrivaled handbook. The interpretations offered here are careful and judicious. This reviewer found himself more often in agreement than not and always learning new things. Patrick D.

Pp. xii + 256. $29.95/$19.95 ($19.95/$14.95 member). In order to say something new and valuable about the much-studied goddess Anat- especially in the absence of significant new data-one needs an original approach and a good dose of common sense. This study (diss., Johns Hopkins University, 1991, under P. Kyle McCarter) has both. To laud the latter first, it suffices to say that Walls avoids the excesses encountered too often in the study of Ugaritic mythology and thereby wins instant sympathy, if not total adhesion. It is particularly noteworthy that he generally avoids retrojecting modern social views into the ancient text: he recognizes the "andro- centric" basis of that society and sets about attempting to discover the place that a goddess such as Anat would have held in literature produced by such a society. The new approach is that of comparative mythology, not so much along Levi- Straussian lines of mythic themes as along lines of character typology, i.e., what are the main types of female goddesses in world mythology and to which type does Anat belong? Walls is not, however, hide-bound to a particular set of types, for he allows for an important degree of elasticity. For example, he is not particularly concerned whether Anat be sexually active or not, or whether she be Baal's paramour or not (pp. 134, 143-44, 154-59): more important are her age, character, and social status. After a brief introduction (pp. 1-11) and a long chapter on "Comparative Perspec- tives" (pp. 13-75), in which the picture of young female goddesses in world mythologies is built up and where some comparisons with Anat are already made, the center of the book is devoted to two chapters dealing with the Ugaritic texts. Here the charac- teristics of the goddess are studied successively under the two primary rubrics of "The Maiden Goddess" (pp. 77-159) and "Violence and Passion" (pp. 161-215). The first of these two chapters deals with questions of age, gender, kinship, and sexual activity; the second with Anat's destructive side (the "passion" in question is not sexual but that of impetuosity). The two rubrics are united in the chapter of conclusions, entitled "Violence and the Maiden" (pp. 217-24). There is a bibliography of works cited (pp. 225-56) but no indices. 505</page></plain_text>
