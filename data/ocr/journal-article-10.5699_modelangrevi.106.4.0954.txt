<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> THE SCENE OF MEDITATION IN WORDSWORTH [. . .] Beside the brook ere is a straggling heap of unhewn stones! And to that place a story appertains. In this fragment from ‘Michael’ one can recognize a distinctive gesture that reappears in a number of Wordsworth’s narrative poems. e discourse halts at the description of an isolated, unremarkable, even dismal object. e de- scription is in the present tense, oen near the beginning of the poem, and serves as a point of departure for a narrative which recounts the history asso- ciated with the object. In ‘Michael’ the ‘straggling heap of unhewn stones’ is all that remains of a sheepfold which the shepherd Michael had been planning to build at the moment at which his son had to be sent away to aid the family’s failing fortunes. On their last day together, he has his son lay the cornerstone of the structure, and proposes that the memory of this moment should be the youth’s ‘anchor’ and his ‘shield’ against the temptations that he might encounter in the city. But before too long, the son gives way to what the poem refers to as ‘evil courses’, presumably gambling, and emigrates to escape disgrace (ll. –). e aged shepherd bears up to this loss as well as he can, but never does finish the sheepfold. When he and his wife die, the farm is sold, and so passes out of the family’s hands aer all. e abandoned heap of stones appears to the speaker of the poem as a poignant record of the family and its history. e concern here is not with this particular poem per se, but with the characteristic type of image or scene in Wordsworth to which the passage cited belongs. Many of Wordsworth’s poems take their point of departure from a tomb, a grave, or an object that, like this heap of stones, comes to serve as a memorial: and these memorial objects tend to have a certain family resemblance, as well as a similar function in the poems, serving to inscribe the past into the landscape, and thus give a spatial fixture to the narrative. One finds similarities to this structure in texts that are quite diverse in their lyric mode. ‘eorn’, for example, a ballad with suggestions of the supernatural, recounting the tale of a young mother who is abandoned by her lover, and who drowns her child in a pond, begins with a very detailed description of a decrepit thorn in the vicinity of the pond: It stands erect this aged thorn; No leaves it has, no thorny points; It is a mass of knotted joints,  ‘Michael’, ll. –.

It stands erect, and like a stone With lichens it is overgrown. (ll. –) e thorn has the same pronounced unimpressiveness (‘A wretched thing for- lorn’) as the heap of stones in ‘Michael’, and serves in the same way to mark the space on which the narrative and the thought of the poem are centred.e major example for this structure is, of course, ‘e Ruined Cottage’. e poet tells how, aer making his way with difficulty across a common, he comes upon the ruin of a house: And thither come at length, beneath a shade Of clustering elms that sprang from the same root I found a ruined house, four naked walls at stared upon each other [. . .] (ll. –) e poet does not at first comment on the house; he merely records its presence. Meeting an older friend, Armytage, in the vicinity, he learns of its former inhabitant, Margaret, whose husband joined the army aer ‘a blighting season’ undermined their livelihood, and who thereaer eked out an increas- ingly lonely and desperate existence awaiting his return. Armytage begins his narrative with a reflection on a disused well belonging to the property, and in the process offers something like an explanation for the peculiar affective charge of such sites: e Poets in their elegies and songs Lamenting the departed call the groves, ey call upon the hills and streams to mourn, And senseless rocks, nor idly; for they speak In these their invocations with a voice Obedient to the strong creative power Of human passion. Sympathies there are More tranquil, yet perhaps of kindred birth, at steal upon the meditative mind And grow with thought. Beside yon spring I stood And eyed its waters till we seemed to feel One sadness, they and I. For them a bond Of brotherhood is broken: time has been When every day the touch of human hand Disturbed their stillness, and they ministered To human comfort. When I stooped to drink A spider’s web hung to the water’s edge, And on the wet and slimy foot-stone lay e useless fragment of a wooden bowl; It moved my very heart. (ll. –) </page> <page sequence="3">  e Scene of Meditation in Wordsworth e analogy between the evocative power that the scene exerts upon the ‘meditative mind’ and the elegiac convention by which the natural world joins in the poet’s mourning is considered for illustrative purposes, but seems ultimately to be abandoned. e spring is a traditional nature-spirit, and lends itself to an anthropomorphic treatment (sharing ‘One sadness’ with the narrator). e same could hardly be said of ‘the slimy foot-stone’, or ‘the useless fragment of a wooden bowl’. In a critical edition of the poem Jonathan Wordsworth, referring to the original manuscripts, shows that the latter passage began as an allusion to Ecclesiastes . , where ‘the pitcher broken at the fountain’ is one of a series of emblems of old age and mortality. Accordingly, he suggests that the fragment of the bowl should be understood, like the broken pitcher, as an ‘archetypal image of life stopped at its source’. is interpretation could readily be extended to all the images. What they most strikingly have in common is their dereliction and disrepair, and by this characteristic they signify visibly the passing of the time, the belonging to the past of the entire narrative with which they are associated. Mary Jacobus writes that in ‘e Ruined Cottage’ ‘e suffering of a single, ordinary wo- man is invested with the tragic significance of mortality itself. e symbolic method by which the decay of the cottage is identified with Margaret’s own decline serves as a general metaphor for human transience’. While this metaphorical suggestion is undoubtedly part of the effect of such images, it does not entirely capture what is most distinctive and unusual about them. In the first place, what this type of image makes present to the reader is not the person or the history associated with the site, nor is it certain meanings provoked by the recollection (e.g. mortality, transience): rather, it is the scene of contemplation itself. e derelict site marks an interruption: it arrests the poet in the course of his travels, fixes and detains the free move- ment of the gaze upon the natural world. Such images, I shall suggest, signal the onset of the specific kind of reflection from which the poem emerges and which it seeks to communicate. In order to propose this reading, I shall draw upon one of Wordsworth’s major texts on poetics, the ‘Essays on Epitaphs’, which argues that poetry (or at least the poetry of memory) is linked to a specific kind of thought and feeling, a certain form of ‘meditation’. e ‘Essays’ will help us to clarify the sense that this word has in Wordsworth’s usage—in the verses cited above, for example, where the poet speaks of ‘Sym-  ‘e Ruined Cottage’; ‘e Brothers’; ‘Michael’, ed. by Jonathan Wordsworth (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, ), p. .  Mary Jacobus, Tradition and Experiment in Wordsworth’s ‘Lyrical Ballads’ () (Oxford: Clarendon Press, ), p. . Jacobus argues that in this respect the poem marks a shi in the concerns of Wordsworth’s poetry: starting from the period in which the first versions of ‘e Ruined Cottage’ are composed (–), ‘his vision is directed beyond topical issues to the permanent themes of loss, change, and mortality’ (p. ).

Chandler, Wordsworth’s Second Nature (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, ), pp. –. </page> <page sequence="4">    pathies [. . .] | [. . .] | at steal upon the meditative mind | And grow with thought’. e ‘Essays on Epitaphs’ were written in , aer Wordsworth had trans- lated six epitaphs by Cabrisi from the Italian, and draw upon and debate with an existing normative discourse on the conventions and procedures of epitaphic commemoration. My concern here will be primarily with the first of the three essays, where, prior to dealing with the style and the representa- tion proper to epitaphs, Wordsworth addresses more fundamental questions as to why there should be epitaphs at all, and what this more or less uni- versal practice signifies about humanity. What is said in response to these questions is of such generality that it seems legitimate to take it in a more extended sense, as a statement on poetry in general. Wordsworth argues that the primary ‘meaning’ of epitaphs—the consciousness from which they arise and to which they bear witness—is not the consciousness of death, but the sense of immortality, since it is only the latter that could give the motivation for memorial practices: it is to me inconceivable that the sympathies of love towards each other that grow with our growth could ever attain to any new strength or even preserve the old aer we had received from the outward senses the impression of death and were in the habit of having that impression daily renewed and its accompanying feeling brought home to ourselves and to those we love; if the same were not counteracted by those communications with our internal being which are anterior to all these experiences. I confess, with me the conviction is absolute, that, if the impression and the sense of death were not thus counterbalanced, such a hollowness would pervade the system of things, such a want of correspondence and consistency, a disproportion so astounding betwixt means and end, that there could be no repose, no joy. Were we to grow up unfostered by this genial warmth, a frost would chill the spirit, so penetrating and powerful, that there could be no motions of the life of love; and infinitely less could we have any wish to be remembered aer we had passed away from a world in which each man had moved about like a shadow. Wordsworth’s thought here bears some resemblance to an argument of Kant’s, in the Critique of Practical Reason (. . ), according to which the possibility of moral action requires the postulate of immortality in order to assure, in  On the relation of this text to the epitaphic tradition (and its waning) see Joshua Scodel, e English Poetic Epitaph: Commemoration and Conflict from Jonson to Wordsworth (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, ). Scodel argues that the ‘Essays’ represent the last moment at which the epitaph appears as the site for determining the public significance of the dead. On the cultural and conceptual situation of Wordsworth’s thought of death and mourning more generally, see Alan Bewell, Wordsworth and the Enlightenment: Nature, Man and Society in the Experimental Poetry (New Haven: Yale University Press, ), Chapter ; Esther Schor, Bearing the Dead: e British Culture of Mourning from the Enlightenment to Victoria (Princeton: Princeton University Press, ); and Kurt Fosso, Buried Communities: Wordsworth and the Bonds of Mourning (Albany, NY: SUNY Press, ).  Citations from the ‘Essays’ are from the Selected Prose, ed. by John O.

In this text, however, immortality is rather more than a ‘postulate’, justified by the interests of moral rationality. e belief in immortality is necessary, not just for the sake of morality, but in order that feeling and life in general be at all sustainable. If it were not for the compensatory resource provided by the sense of immortality, it seems, the recognition of the universality of death would suffice to put an end to moral and affective life. e assertion of the sense of immortality is, for the most part at least, maintained here independently of its doctrinal context in Christian thought. Questions of the validity of this conviction and of the nature of aerlife are le in abeyance, and instead the interest goes towards the belief itself, as an essential movement of mind, distinct from the faculty of reason and the outward sense. e ‘sense of immortality’ is not natural, nor is it derived from any specific religious teaching, but is entirely identified with the discourse of the self with itself from which it emerges—with what Wordsworth calls ‘com- munications with our internal being’ (p. , cited above). e movement of this meditation is illustrated by two key metaphorical passages. In the first of these a child stands before a river, asking aer the origin and the end point of the ‘running stream’. e answer can be supplied with a ‘word’ or ‘an image drawn from the map’, but the questioning of the child has already carried it much further: And the spirit of the answer must have been, though the word might be sea or ocean, accompanied perhaps with an image gathered from a map, or from the real object in nature—these might have been the letter, but the spirit of the answer must have been as inevitably—a receptacle without bounds or dimensions;—nothing less than infinity. (Selected Prose, pp. –) ese reflections revisit the themes and the language of the ‘Immortality’ ode: as there, the child is not a figure of spontaneous or instilled belief, but of a certain kind of philosophical insight.e child is able to perceive the word or the image on the map, and by implication, knowledge of our death as merely outer evidence, as the letter of the ‘spiritual’ meaning, namely, the truth of immortality.e transformation that takes place here is illustrated by a second metaphor, comparing the movement of such thought to the circumnavigation of the globe. e reflection on mortality, Wordsworth suggests, is circular: As, in sailing upon the orb of this planet, a voyage toward the regions where the sun sets, conducts gradually to the quarter where we have been accustomed to behold it  On the foundation of the community in the confrontation with mortality in Wordsworth see Fosso, Buried Communities.  In the ‘Ode’ the child is apostrophized as ‘ou best philosopher, who dost yet keep | y heritage, thou Eye among the blind | at, deaf and silent, read’st the eternal deep | Haunted for ever by the eternal mind’ (ll. –). </page> <page sequence="6">    come forth at its rising; and, in like manner, a voyage toward the east, the birthplace in our imagination of the morning, leads finally to the quarter where the sun is last seen when he departs from our eyes; so the contemplative Soul, travelling in the direction of the country of mortality, advances to the country of everlasting life; and, in like manner, may she continue to explore those cheerful tracts, till she is brought back, for her advantage and benefit, to the land of transitory things—of sorrow and of tears. (Selected Prose, pp. –) With this complex analogy, Wordsworth describes the specific meditative structure from which the epitaph comes. For this reason, it can be taken also to describe the structure of thought underlying poems such as ‘Michael’ and ‘e Ruined Cottage’, which, if not epitaphic, are certainly retrospective and memorial in character. In entering into the ‘country of mortality’—that is to say, in sustaining the meditation on mortality—the fact of death, given in the evidence of the outward senses, is transformed into the assurance of immor- tality. is transformation takes place by a circular movement, comparable to that by which, in travelling towards the night, one is ultimately led into the orient, the source of the morning. As in the ‘Immortality’ ode, Wordsworth’s conception of immortality is much closer to Plato than to Christianity: the conception strongly resembles the passage from the Phaedo ( – ) in which Socrates seeks to justify the conviction of the immortality of the soul by reference to the more general principle that all things are generated out of their opposites. e day, for example, is generated out of the night, and conversely, and just as death is only possible as a result of a prior stage of life, so too life can only be generated out of death. e soul, Socrates concludes, must be preserved aer the destruction of the body, so that it can be reborn into a new life. Wordsworth retains the circular structure of Plato’s argument for immortality, but replaces its substantive cosmological claims with the description of a movement of mind. e transformation that takes place is no longer that of the soul as it moves through different orders of being, but rather that of the fact of death as it assumes different aspects in the course of a prolonged reflection. e possibility of such transformations can only lie with the time of the contemplation, as the element in which they take place. is condition is not clearly stated in these terms, but one sees it subtly registered in the language, as if it were the not fully conscious basis of Wordsworth’s conviction. Con- templation is like navigation because it only ‘gradually’ and ‘finally’ leads to the reversal of darkness and light, life and death: the movement of the voyage around the earth is an image of the day and night of sustained reflection. In the preceding passage the ability of the child to arrive at ‘the spirit of the  Wordsworth writes of ‘the subtle progress by which, both in the natural and the moral world, qualities pass insensibly into their contraries, and things revolve upon each other’ (Selected Prose, p. ). </page> <page sequence="7">  e Scene of Meditation in Wordsworth answer’ (i.e. immortality) is traced back to ‘the early, obstinate, and unappeas- able inquisitiveness of children’ (p. ). e phrasing is markedly similar to a passage in the ‘Immortality’ ode, in which the child is invoked as the ‘best Philosopher’, an ‘eye among the Blind’, able to read ‘the eternal deep’, because of its ‘obstinate questionings | Of sense and outward things’ (‘Ode’, ll. –). e ‘obstinacy’ associated with the particular insight of this phi- losophical child, like the night of contemplation, suggests that the sense of immortality, the resource that permits life and feeling to extend beyond the cognition of death, is itself based in prolonged reflection. In other words, the sense of immortality corresponds to an experience of time that is essentially different from the cognition of transience and mortality. A passage from the ‘Boy of Winander’ is particularly relevant here since it stages precisely this kind of prolonged reflection in a context that is close to the distinctive kind of scenes of contemplation with which we began. Having described the childhood of the boy, the poem concludes: —Fair are the woods, and beauteous is the spot, e Vale where he was born; the Churchyard hangs Upon a Slope above the Village School, And there, along that bank, when I have passed At evening, I believe that oentimes A full half-hour together I have stood Mute—looking at the Grave in which he lies. (e Prelude, . –) Commenting on the ‘curiously precise’ ‘full half-hour’ during which the poet stares at the grave, Paul de Man writes that this ‘half-hour [. . .] introduces a long, extended period of continuous duration that exists outside of the ordinary time of daily activity’. De Man goes on to argue in some detail that the structure of Wordsworth’s poem is designed precisely to constitute such a duration, and even that this ‘half-hour’ prefigures the time in which one reads and reflects on the poem. Such an analysis suggests the conclusion that time is present in Wordsworth’s poetry, not only as a theme, but as the very element of the thought and the language. All thought unfolds in time, no doubt, but in practical and cognitive thought, time is merely occupied and used up, and  ‘Time and History in Wordsworth’, in Romanticism and Contemporary Criticism: e Gauss Seminar and Other Papers, ed. by E. S. Burt and others (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, ), pp. – (pp. –). Interestingly, the same expression recurs in a slightly different context in ‘e Brothers’, another poem based on the encounter with the memorial. Here, Leonard, a sailor returned to his familial home aer a long absence at sea, stands before an unidentified grave for ‘a full half hour’, debating with himself whether it had been there before he le (and thus, whether it could be the grave of his brother James): ‘He had found | Another grave, near which a full half hour | He had remained, but, as he gazed, there grew | Such a confusion in his memory, | at he began to doubt [. . .]’ (ll. –). </page> <page sequence="8">    does not have any constitutive role. In a calculation, for example, or any exercise of the rational intelligence, the time that the mental operation requires is nothing but delay, and is not expressed or implied in the result. Since one would like to acquire as much intelligence of the world as possible, the time that it takes to acquire such knowledge is experienced as pure finite time, the time that is always running away from us. e thought that Wordsworth’s poetry seeks to produce, by contrast, depends on time as duration: it is only possible inasmuch as time can be inhabited as a certain kind of space, in which contrasts such as life and death or past and present are held together in juxtaposition, and can come to pass into each other. Although this condition is not developed in quite these terms by Wordsworth, once it is recognized, many statements begin to take on a new resonance. Consider, for example, the passage in ‘e Ruined Cottage’ in which Margaret’s story is said to be ‘a tale of silent suffering, hardly clothed | In bodily form, and to the grosser sense | But ill adapted, scarcely palpable | To him who does not think’ (ll. –). JonathanWordsworth, in general rather favourable to Wordsworth, hears in these lines ‘priggishness and condescen- sion’. ese are certainly harsh words, and yet understandable if the lines should be taken to signify that the readership can be classed as thinking or non-thinking, depending on their appreciation of Wordsworth’s poems. One finds a similar claim in the  ‘Preface’ to the Lyrical Ballads. Defending himself against the charge of ‘triviality and meanness’ in his subjects (and in this context, one has to think of the very ‘lowly’ character of the images with which we began) Wordsworth argues that ‘descriptions of such objects’ are given purpose by his ‘habits of meditation’. And he adds that ‘Poems to which any value can be attached were never produced on any variety of subjects but by a man who, being possessed of more than usual organic sensibility, had also thought long and deeply’ (Selected Prose, p. ). Such claims appear in a rather different light if ‘thinking’ can be understood as a name for a specific practice of reflection, linked to poetic language, and characterized not so much by its subject-matter or by its content as by the time in which it unfolds. At the conclusion of ‘e Ruined Cottage’, having narrated Margaret’s life, Armytage enjoins the poet (and the reader): Be wise and chearful, and no longer read e forms of things with an unworthy eye. She sleeps in the calm earth, and peace is here. I well remember that those very plumes ose weeds, and the high spear grass on that wall, By mist and silent rain-drops silvered o’er As once I passed did to my heart convey  Jonathan Wordsworth, e Music of Humanity: A Critical Study of ‘e Ruined Cottage’, Incorporating Texts from a Manuscript of – (New York: Harper and Row, ), p. . </page> <page sequence="9">  e Scene of Meditation in Wordsworth So still an image of tranquillity, So calm and still, and looked so beautiful Amid the uneasy thoughts which filled my mind, at what we feel of sorrow and despair From ruin and from change, and all the grief e passing shews of being leave behind, Appeared an idle dream that could not live Where meditation was. [. . .] (ll. –) It does not seem at all necessary to understand the consolation expressed at the end here in terms of immortality, in the literal sense. e movement of thought, however, is clearly very close to that described in the metaphorical passages we have studied in the ‘Essays on Epitaphs’: there is the same sense that, in the course of a sustained ‘meditation’, death and mortality become mere outer signs, ‘passing shows of being’ that have to cede, at least in the priority they have as factual cognitions, before the poetic experience of time. Terms such as ‘thinking’ or ‘meditation’, then, have a somewhat more spe- cific sense in Wordsworth than a general attitude of seriousness or gravity, in opposition to superficiality or foolishness: they designate a particular dispo- sition of mind, even a particular arc of thought, that sustains the poem, and that the poem, in turn, seeks to communicate to the reader. e constitution of such an attitude is also at issue in the ‘Essays on Epitaphs’, when it comes to the prescription of the rhetoric proper to epitaphic composition. It is worth noting, however, that in these passages, where the relationship between time and language is formulated more explicitly, it takes a somewhat different form from that which we have been seeking to uncover. e epitaph, Wordsworth proposes, should aim for a ‘due proportion of the common or universal feeling of humanity to sensations excited by a distinct and clear conception, conveyed to the reader’s mind, of the individual’ (p. ). In order to produce this ‘com- mon or universal feeling’, the epitaph should strive for impersonality of voice and for economy in representation, and the attention given to the individual should not extend to detailed portraiture or analysis. e character of the deceased is only to be seen ‘as a tree through a tender haze or a luminous mist, that spiritualizes and beautifies it’ (ibid.). e poetic attitude is here conceived in contrast with the kind of perception and evaluation that exists in living interaction, conditioned as it is by contin- gent and specific social relations. e intervention of death creates a distance that allows one to see (in retrospect) the individual as a figure of humanity in general, a perception which is clearly conceived as tending to idealization (i.e. to spiritualization and beautification). is conception is significant, since it anticipates a whole orientation in the reading of Wordsworth’s narrative and memorial poems; Michael or Margaret become archetypal figures, represen- </page> <page sequence="10">    tatives of an essential humanity that can only be perceived as such by way of a privileged poetic vantage-point, one that no longer shares in the ordinary conditions of human interaction. To formulate it like this is, of course, to recall the arguments of vari- ous strands of political criticism, which have sought to demonstrate the ideological function of Romantic poetics. e supposedly ‘higher’ poetic understanding, with its sense for the permanent things that come to light in tranquil recollection, can then appear as a sublimation of the historical and the political relations which, as such criticism has recalled, also have a significant presence in the details of Wordsworth’s poems. e debates these arguments have occasioned cannot, of course, be considered in detail here. But the analysis of the specific area of Wordsworth’s production at issue here does allow us to see that the epitaphic or memorial perception can be conceived in a quite different way. In the idealizing model that supports the prescrip- tive rhetoric, the poem is able to reveal the ‘truth’ of its subject, beyond the distortions of empirical perception, because the retrospective mode situates the speaker outside of time, or at least outside of the time of his subject, who now definitively belongs to the past. In contrast, throughout our reading, we have seen the poetic mode of thinking associated, not with distance in time, but with the experience of duration—an experience that is located entirely within time, to the point where the understanding it proposes need not even be considered to have any objective validity, beyond the time of the poem. It is at this point that we can begin to see the dismal scenes from which we took our point of departure in a new light. In their eloquent disrepair, the ‘straggling heap of unhewn stones’, the ‘fragment of a wooden bowl’, and the ‘wet and slimy foot-stone’ have the effect of concentrating the reflection upon what is still present—the persistence of a habitation, a project, a memorial— no less than what has passed away. What is suggested by the diction of such passages—‘straggling’, ‘knotted’, ‘rough’, ‘unhewn’, ‘useless’, ‘fragment’—is the resistance these things propose or, one could say, their obstinacy, in the sense of a resistance where rationality or necessity lies on the side of the antagonistic tendency, on the side of that which is being obstinately resisted. e thorn, for example, in the poem of that name, has been shaped by its resistance to a powerful movement to erode it, on the part of ‘heavy tus of moss’ that appear to be ‘bent | With plain and manifest intent | To drag it to the ground | All joined in one endeavor | To bury this poor thorn for ever’ (ll. –). e emphasis that the poems give to these objects tends to reflect  For some quite different approaches to this critique see Alan Liu, Wordsworth: e Sense of History (Stanford: Standford University Press, ); Forest Pyle, e Ideology of Imagination: Subject and Society in the Discourse of Romanticism (Stanford: Stanford University Press, ); omas Pfau, Wordsworth’s Profession: Form, Class and the Logic of Early Romantic Production (Stanford: Stanford University Press, ). </page> <page sequence="11">  e Scene of Meditation in Wordsworth this resistance through a subtle double equivalence. e fact that the poem is spoken with these ruins or memorials in view tends to suggest an analogy between the resistance to time on the part of these things, and the resistance of the characters to the shocks dealt to them in the course of time. More import- antly, if also more implicitly, it suggests an analogy between this resistance to time as the force that carries away and destroys, and the resistance the thing and the story pose to the assimilation of the understanding—between the perseverance of the object of thought and the pause that it gives to thought. In this way the duration in which the poem unfolds is pre-scribed in the scene of ‘meditation’, discovered already in the object from which the narra- tive departs. Although the significance of the scene is not elucidated in the poem itself, the repetition of similar elements through a number of poems and the strangeness of the language (i.e. its strikingly ‘unpoetic’ quality) consis- tently draw attention to this moment, investing it with a significance beyond what is apparent, and implying that it initiates a break with everyday affairs and everyday modes of thought. I would like to corroborate the analysis by looking at one final poem in which some of the elements discussed appear, and in which the complex of thought here outlined seems to come more directly to expression. e poem is ‘A narrow girdle of rough stones and crags’, the fourth of the ‘Poems on the Naming of Places’, written in . e poet is with two friends (Coleridge and Mary Wordsworth), walking along a coastal path: A narrow girdle of rough stones and crags, A rude and natural causeway, interposed Between the water and a winding slope Of copse and thicket, leaves the eastern shore Of Grasmere safe in its own privacy. And there, myself and two beloved Friends One calm September morning, ere the mist Had altogether yielded to the sun, Sauntered on this retired and difficult way. —Ill suits the road with one in haste, but we Played with our time [. . .]. (ll. –) e ‘narrow girdle of rough stones’ of the opening line is a natural rock forma- tion (‘A rude and natural causeway’), and does not have the connection with a local history that we have seen in the other poems. But the similarity with the verbal phrase in ‘Michael’ (which speaks of ‘a straggling heap of unhewn stones’) suggests the presence of a kind of poetic perception similar to the set of images with which we have been concerned. Another poem written in the same year, ‘Lines: Written with a Slate-Pencil upon a Stone’ begins: ‘Stranger! is hillock of misshapen stones | Is not a ruin of the ancient time, | [. . .] | [. . .] </page> <page sequence="12">    tis nothing more | an the rude embryo of a little dome | Or pleasure-house [. . .]’ (ll. –). e fact that Wordsworth should write three poems in one year that begin with or are centred on the depiction of an unremarkable hill of stones seems to suggest that one can see something more in these images than their immediate representational validity. e ‘narrow girdle of rough stones and crags’ is first characterized in terms of the resistance it poses to movement. It makes for a ‘retired and difficult way’: ‘Ill suits the road with one in haste’. e speaker, however, fails to perceive this resistance—precisely because he is not in haste, but is, rather, idling: [. . .] but we Played with our time: and, as we strolled along, It was our occupation to observe Such objects as the waves had tossed ashore, Feather, or leaf, or weed, or withered bough Each on the other heaped along the line Of the dry wreck. [. . .] (ll. –) e implications of a movement of wastage and indifferent time are stated and yet pointedly not remarked by the three friends. Hence, perhaps, the muted note of censure, the implication of thoughtlessness, that hangs over the report of their walk. ‘In our vacant mood | Not seldom did we stop to watch some tu | Or dandelion seed or thistle’s beard [. . .]’ (ll. –): ‘And oen trifling with a privilege | Alike indulged to all, we paused, one now, | And now the other, to point out, perchance | To pluck, some flower or waterweed [. . .]’ (ll. –). e reproof implied in ‘vacant mood’ or in ‘trifling’ seems out of place when applied to the conduct of an innocent morning walk; but in the context of the poem as a whole it prefigures the aberration recounted in the brief episode that makes up the second part of the poem: [. . .] suddenly rough a thin veil of glittering haze, we saw Before us on a point of jutting land e tall and upright figure of a Man. (ll. –) Confronted with this ‘figure of a Man’, who is fishing at a time when the  One can compare this passage to the lines from ‘e Old Cumberland Beggar’ describing the ground that holds the steady, though vacant, attention of the old beggar: ‘us, from day to day, | Bowbent, his eyes for ever on the ground, | He plies his weary journey, seeing still | And never knowing that he sees, some straw | Some scattered leaf, or marks which, in one track | e nails of cart or chariot wheel have le | Impressed on the white road, in the same line’ (ll. –). On the basis of manuscript study, Jacobus identifies these lines as the original sketch out of which both this poem and ‘Old Man Travelling’ emerge (Tradition and Experiment in Wordsworth’s ‘Lyrical Ballads’ (), p. ). Despite their paucity of historical and narrative content, then, one can seek in them an intuition to which the poem attempts to respond. </page> <page sequence="13">  e Scene of Meditation in Wordsworth rest of the community is busy with the harvest, the friends give way to ‘ready comments’, in censure of his idleness when he could be providing for himself for the winter ahead. ey are brought up short, however, when he turns to greet them: us talking of that Peasant we approached Close to the spot where with his rod and line He stood alone; whereat he turn’d his head To greet us—and we saw a man worn down By sickness, gaunt and lean, with sunken cheeks And wasted limbs, his legs so long and lean at for my single self I looked at them, Forgetful of the body they sustained.— Too weak to labour in the harvest field, e man was using his best skill to gain A pittance from the dead unfeeling lake at knew not of his wants. I will not say What thoughts immediately were ours, nor how e happy idleness of that sweet morn With all its lovely images, was changed To serious musing and to self reproach. Nor did we fail to see within ourselves What need there is to be reserved in speech, And temper all our thoughts with charity. —erefore, unwilling to forget that day, My Friend, Myself and She who then received e same admonishment, have called the place By a memorial name, uncouth indeed As e’er by Mariner was giv’n to Bay Or Foreland on a new-discovered coast, And, POINT RASH-JUDGMENT is the Name it bears. (ll. –) Certainly, at a first level of meaning the poem is perilously close to moral- ization, a danger that Wordsworth, along with many of his commentators, does not always succeed in avoiding. But surely the poetic interest of this text does not lie in the ‘admonishment’ to consider matters carefully before condemning others. is ‘moral’ serves rather to give rhetorical unity to a poem which has at its centre the dramatization of a sharp transition between two dispositions of mind, a sudden shi from frivolous enjoyment to ‘serious musing and to self reproach’. e initial disposition is oriented towards the surface of things, as is emblematically indicated by the friends’ absorption in what is taking place on the surface of the lake. is state is pleasant, and by no means has to be seen as culpable—a number ofWordsworth’s poems celebrate idleness and a festive pleasure in nature’s appearances (e.g. ‘Expostulation and Reply’, ‘e Tables Turned’).

As with terms such as ‘meditation’ and ‘thinking’, what is important in this ‘musing’ is not so much the content that occupies it, but the fact that it is emphatically not ‘rash’—that is to say, that it disposes over time in order to hold together the contrasts of truth and error, health and age, perhaps even leisure and labour. e condition of such a thought is announced in occulted form in the ‘narrow girdle of rough stones and crags’, whose resistance, both to the forces of nature and to human access, prefigures the resistance to understanding and judgement which this poem, like each of the texts we have studied, locates as its own beginning.
