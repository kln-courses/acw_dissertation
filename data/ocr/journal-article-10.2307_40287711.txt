<plain_text><page sequence="1">Habitation and land use patterns in the Upper Mangrove Creek catchment, New South Wales central coast, Australia Val Attenbrow Abstract Explanations for dramatic late Holocene changes in numbers of habitation sites and artefacts in Australia include changes in demography, technology, subsistence strategies, risk minimisation strategies, levels of mobility and land use patterns. Archaeological fieldwork in the Upper Mangrove Creek catchment, New South Wales central coast hinterland, revealed evidence of increasing numbers of habitation sites over the past 1 1 ,000 years, with dramatic increases in the 2nd and 1st millennia BP. However, the timing and direction of changes in artefact accumulation rates in individual habitations and the catchment as a whole did not coincide with trends in the habitation sites. Dramatic increases occurred in the 3rd millennium BP and substantial decreases in the 1st millennium BP. This paper explores ways of interpreting the late Holocene trends in the habitation indices for the Upper Mangrove Creek catchment in terms of changing habitation, mobility and land use patterns. Introduction During the 1970s and 1980s various explanations were proposed for perceived dramatic increases in numbers of habitation sites and artefacts in late Holocene Australia. These included population increase at a continental level as well as inter- or intra-regional shifts in population (e.g. Lampert and Hughes 1974; Flood 1976:32, 1980:281-82, 1995:248^9; Luebbers 1978, 1981; Ross 1981, 1985; Hughes and Lampert 1982; Beaton 1983, 1985; Morwood 1984:369; Flood et al. 1987:23). Decreases in site or artefact numbers and population decline were less frequently acknowledged (but see Stockton and Holland 1974:55-56; Hiscock 1986:40). Increases in site and artefact numbers were also part of the archaeological evidence Lourandos (1980, 1983, 1985a, 1985b) used to support an hypothesis of late Holocene intensification and increasing social complexity. Natural processes such as site destruction or burial were also proffered for the greater numbers of recent sites (Hughes and Lampert 1982:24-26). Changes in artefact (or implement) accumulation rates at individual sites were interpreted as changes in 'the intensity of site use' (e.g. Lampert and Hughes 1974; Moore 1981; Hughes and Lampert 1982; Smith 1982; Morwood 1986:96, 98; Flood et al. 1987) as well as a shift to greater use of open camps and lesser use of rockshelters (Stockton and Holland 1974:48, 56, 58; Stockton 1981:13). Other explanations involved modifications to subsistence techniques (Attenbrow 1982b:76-77), technology/ knapping techniques (Hiscock 1981, 1982:43; Ross 1985:83), raw material use (Mulvaney 1960:74; Ross 1985:83), intra-site discard behaviour (Johnson 1979:92-93, 106; Smith 1982:114), and introduction of the Small Tool Tradition (Hughes and Lampert 1982:24-25; Smith 1982:114). Variations in mobility patterns and risk minimisation strategies were also advanced to explain dramatic changes in habitation site and artefact numbers (Stockton and Holland 1974:48; Attenbrow 1982b:76, 1987:368-77,384; Rowland 1983:73), but only recently have these themes been used increasingly in regional models and hypotheses, often in association with climatic and/or environmental shifts (e.g. McNiven 1992; Hiscock 1994, 1996, 2002; Morwood and L'Oste-Brown 1995). Increases and decreases in habitation site and artefact numbers for the Upper Mangrove Creek catchment are expressed as four indices: rates of habitation establishment, numbers of habitations used/millennium; artefact accumul- ation rates for individual habitations, and local accumulation rates for the catchment as a whole. Ways of interpreting dramatic late Holocene changes in the habitation indices for the catchment are explored below by examining the distribution patterns and likely function of habitations in the catchment, and mobility models. Background Between 1979 and 1982 I undertook site survey and excavations in the Upper Mangrove Creek catchment for my PhD research (Attenbrow 1982b, 1987, forthcoming). This fieldwork overlapped in time and space with a salvage program for Aboriginal sites to be impacted by the Mangrove Creek Dam (Furey 1978; Vinnicombe 1980; Attenbrow 1981, 1982a). The salvage program, undertaken between 1977 and 1982, was restricted principally to the storage area, whereas the PhD fieldwork encompassed the entire dam catchment. The 101 km2 dam catchment is about 30 km from the coast, slightly northwest of Wyong on the New South Wales central coast (Fig. 1), and has a temperate climate. Mangrove Creek flows south and joins the Hawkesbury River about 28 km from the dam wall. The lower reaches of Mangrove Creek are estuarine. The catchment is part of the heavily dissected Hornsby Plateau; the ridgetops and upper ridgesides are of Hawkesbury sandstone which is underlain by Narrabeen Group sandstones into which the creek and its tributaries have cut in the lower elevations. Apart from several cleared areas along the main section of Mangrove Creek and on the periphery ridgetops, the catchment is forested. For the site survey, a 10% stratified random sample, the total dam catchment was stratified into six topographic zones: main valley bottom, main valley ridgesides, subsidiary valley bottoms, subsidiary valley ridgesides, periphery ridgetops, peninsula ridgetops (Attenbrow 1982b:70, Map 3, 1987:92-92, Table 4.1). Fifty-nine Aboriginal sites were recorded in the random sampling units (Fig. 2). These sites have 80 archaeological traits in rockshelters and open locations: 35 archaeological deposits (rockshelters - 30; open locations - 5), 22 images Anthropology, Australian Museum, 6 College Street, Sydney, NSW 2010, Australia.

(rockshelters - 20; open rock platforms - 2), 22 grinding areas (rockshelters - 2; open rock platforms - 20), and one burial (rocksheiter). Twenty-seven archaeological deposits were excavated, three (Loggers Shelter, Black Hands Shelter and Geebung shelter) as part of the salvage program (Attenbrow 1981). Three shelters with very shallow sediment, a deposit identified after field work was completed, and four disturbed open deposits were not excavated. Data Thirty archaeological deposits, all in rockshelters, are included in the analyses. The five open deposits, each with less than twelve artefacts, were excluded. Radiocarbon ages were obtained for 15 archaeological deposits (Table 1). These ages range from ca 350 years to ca 1 1 ,000 years BP. Age estimates for the remaining 15 deposits were based on artefact types, relative frequency of principal stone materials, and the depth/nature of the deposit (Attenbrow 1987: 11 8-20, Table 7.2). The size and richness of stone artefact and faunal assemblages in the excavated deposits vary widely. Numbers of stone artefacts retrieved from each deposit range from one to 7397 (Table 2). Three shelters were identified as having archaeological deposit on the basis of faunal remains (Two Moths), the presence of worked bone (Bird Tracks) and modified wood (Firestick). Faunal remains were found in 22 deposits (Attenbrow 1987:Table 5.7). Only Loggers had a relatively substantial faunal assemblage, though it was restricted to deposits dating to the last 3000 years. During analyses, archaeological deposits have been called (perhaps incorrectly in hindsight) 'habitations', although it was not assumed they represented only campsites. To examine how use of the catchment changed Figure 2 Upper Mangrove Creek catchment: Aboriginal sites in the random sampling units.

With one exception, habitations first used more than 1000 years ago, were used continually - though not necessarily continuously - in each millennium until contact. Two indices were calculated for numbers of artefacts: the artefact accumulation rates for each individual deposit/habitation, and the local artefact accumulation rates (Fig. 3c) for which data from all habitations were amalgamated to create rates for the whole catchment. All indices were calculated as number per millennium. These indices show increases in the number of habitations established and used over time, with dramatic increases in the 2nd and 1st millennia BP (Figs 3a and 3b). Artefact accumulation rates for individual habitations varied, with substantial and quite dramatic increases occurring in different millennia but usually in the last 3000 years, and with decreased rates in the upper levels of many deposits. Trends in the local artefact accumulation rates contrast in timing and direction with those for the habitation indices, with a dramatic increase in the 3rd millennium BP and a substantial decline in the 1st millennium BP (Fig. 3c). Analysis of the habitation and artefact data according to topographic zones indicates that habitations were established first in the main valley bottom, then on the periphery ridgetop and then in areas between (Fig. 4). This patterning suggests that over time, and particularly in the last 2000 years, as well as increasing numbers of habitations in the catchment, the number of topographic zones in which new habitations were established increased; there was a greater dispersal of activities within the catchment over time. Discussion In interpreting the long-term trends in the catchment's habitation and artefact indices, demographic changes at a continental scale cannot be discounted as having played a role. However, the catchment's trends would not necessarily have followed those for the continent as a 22 Australian Archaeology, Number 57, 2003</page><page sequence="4">Attenbrow Total no.

Inter- or intra-regional shifts in population also may have occurred in different periods of time, due to changes in seasonal subsistence patterns and/or in territorial/ range/domain boundaries, or redistribution of populations in response to long-term global climatic/environmental changes. However, no archaeological evidence for such movements has yet been identified in the catchment or elsewhere on the New South Wales central coast. Changes in habitation distribution patterns and the way subsistence activities were organised within the catchment, possibly including shifts in mobility patterns, are also likely reasons for changes in both the numbers of habitations, and the numbers of artefacts within individual habitations and the catchment as a whole. Variations in 'intensity of site use' also cannot be discounted, but other reasons could account for increasing or decreasing artefact accumulation rates in individual habitations (Attenbrow 1987) and these need to be addressed before accepting it as an explanation. Changing trends in both habitation and artefact indices reflect the way people operated within only one part of their country - the Upper Mangrove Creek catchment. This area was probably only part of a clan territory and part of the range of a band or bands who, at contact, belonged to a language group known as the Darginung. In 1788 (and for an unknown time beforehand) the Darginung belonged to a yet larger 'culture-area' (Lampert 1971:70), which extended east of the Great Dividing Range from Port Macquarie to the New South Wales/Victorian border (Fraser 1892[1893]:32, map, Appendix X:92; Attenbrow 2002:33). Trends in the catchment's habitation and artefact indices thus cannot be interpreted without reference to what its inhabitants may have been doing in other parts of their country or their neighbour's country. Dramatic changes in the artefact accumulation rates of the catchment and other eastern Australian regions were not correlated in time with the appearance of new implement types, or changes in technology or raw materials (Attenbrow 1987:Chapters 3, 9 and 10). In southeastern Australia these changes were part of a Australian Archaeology, Number 57, 2003 23</page><page sequence="5">Habitation and land use patterns Figure 4 Upper Mangrove Creek catchment: number and distribution of habitations used in each millennium. geographically wide-spread, long-term sequence of stone artefact assemblages which McCarthy (1964:201-2) named the Eastern Regional Sequence. Broad-scale behavioural changes reflected in the stone artefact assemblages across the culture-area would have been a 'background' to the habitation patterns and subsistence strategies used in catchment which, in turn, would have been related to the catchment's specific environmental characteristics and the part the catchment played in its inhabitants' lives. Several other explanations or interpretations for dramatic changes in habitation and artefact indices have been shown to be not applicable to the catchment. For example, the impacts of geomorphological processes (e.g. burial, erosion and deflation) (Attenbrow 1987:Chapter 5). Some of the foregoing explanations cannot be fully addressed without further fieldwork or analyses of excavated assemblages and/or data relating to other archaeological traits. The following discussions focus on changing trends in only the catchment's habitation indices (Figs 3A and 3B). In calculating these indices all habitations were considered functionally equal, but, given the variation in artefact numbers in each habitation (Table 2), the same activities may not have been carried out in each (Attenbrow 1987:96). The likely function of the catchment's habitations is thus explored as a start to investigating habitation, subsistence and mobility patterns that operated within the catchment. Base camps, transit camps and activity locations Ethnographically based forager-collector models (e.g. Binford 1980, 1982, 1983; Foley 1981a, 1981b, 1981c) have been important in identifying past habitation, subsistence and land use patterns from archaeological site distribution patterns. In these models, the principal contexts for discard or abandonment of cultural remains, and thus places which can be identified archaeologically, are 'residential (home) bases' and 'locations'. Binford (1980:9-10) defined residential bases as '... the hub of subsistence activities, the locus out of which foraging parties originate and where most processing, manufacturing, and maintenance activities take place'. Locations were defined as ... a place where extractive tasks are exclusively carried out ... only limited quantities [of food and raw materials] are procured there during any one episode and therefore the site is occupied for only a very short period of time. ... abandonment of tools is at a very low rate. In fact, few if any tools may be expected to remain at such a site. Binford (1980:10) defined three other places associated with the 'collector end' of the forager-collector continuum: 'field camps' (overnight camps while away from the residential base), 'stations' (e.g. ambush locations or hunting stands) and 'caches', though he considered foragers rarely used such locations. However, other researchers include a much wider range of places as 'activity locations' within forager subsistence strategies - hunting hides, viewing/look-out points, artefact preparation sites, manufacturing localities, tree-felling areas, water holes, ceremonial locales, burial areas, shade areas, as well as food (e.g. kill and butchery sites, and plant procurement areas), firewood and raw material sources (Foley 1981b:164; 1981c:ll, 107, Table 2.1; Bettinger 1991:66; Veth 1993:83, 90). In her work with the Anbarra of northern Australia, as well as home bases and overnight camps, Meehan (1988:179-80) observed the use of 'dinner-time camps', at some of which, shellfish were processed and the meat taken back to the home base to eat. For the Upper Mangrove Creek catchment, there are no historical or ethnographic descriptions of subsistence strategies and land use practices for the early colonial period. Historical sources for adjacent areas (e.g. Threlkeld 1826; Brayshaw 1986; Vinnicombe 1980; Attenbrow 2002) suggest that groups moved frequently and those inhabiting the hinterland of the New South Wales central coast would have employed strategies closer to those of foragers rather than collectors. It is thus proposed that the catchment's inhabitants were relatively mobile hunter-gatherers who moved between many short-term base camps within their country, with group size varying according to weather, season and locality. While in the catchment, family groups stayed at base camps for several nights undertaking a range of domestic tasks, some members going out daily to obtain food and raw materials. Activities undertaken at locations away from base camps may have included: (a) hunting, butchering, fishing [including eels] and shellfishing [freshwater mussel], plant and honey collecting; (b) raw 24 Australian Archaeology, Number 57, 2003</page><page sequence="6">Attenbrow material procurement - such as stone, wood, plant fibre and In both series, there are large gaps between the clusters resin; and, (c) religious or ritual responsibilities. During at the higher end of the figures, but at the lower end, there these daily forays, to places either inside or outside the is no obvious break between 'small' assemblages and catchment, damaged tools and implements would have been 'large' assemblages. There is thus no clear indication of mended and food prepared and/or eaten at locations away what can be assigned as activity locations/transit camps or from the base camp.

The number of artefacts in each 'habitation' varied widely and the small size of the some Table 3 Upper Mangrove Creek catchment: millennial assemblages (even when extrapolated to estimated total assemblages grouped according to K-means numbers) suggests not all were base camps. Even the six analysis, long-term habitations (i.e., those used for more than 3000 years) with the most abundant and richest assemblages were unlikely to have been base camps throughout their history Clearly, in testing the proposed habitation and land use of use; their first use may have been as activity locations or model, one avenue to investigate will be whether the transit camps (cf. Morwood and L'Oste-Brown 1 995: 1 6 1 ).

Therefore, to explore used base camps could overlap in size with frequently used this idea further, I used the breakdown into 'millennial activity locations. Assemblage/artefact attributes chosen for assemblages', which was used in calculating the local analysis need to be those that will identify whether artefact accumulation rates (Table 2; Attenbrow assemblages are derived from domestic activities at base 1987:Appendix 5).

What activities are represented by the assemblages? What do use-wear and residue analyses tell us about tool functions? What reduction stages are represented in the stone artefacts -stone implement manufacture or only implement maintenance? What particular skeletal parts of animals are present? What other cultural features are present, e.g. hearths or heat-treatment pits? Issues relating to measuring 'intensity of site use' could be addressed by analysing deposition rates for more than one set of evidence, e.g. faunal as well as stone artefact assemblages, charcoal and sediments (cf. Smith 1982; Hiscock 1984:134; Morwood 1986). Site location analysis may also identify whether any category is associated with specific environmental or topographic contexts and habitat/resource zones (Foley 1981a:4-7). Using the above basis for assigning assemblages as base camps or activity locations, only one of the seven long-term 'habitations' appears to have been a base camp throughout it history of use - Emu Tracks, 2 first established in the 4th millennium BP (Table 2). The function (or principal function) of the other long-term 'habitations' changed over time from activity location to base camp. Loggers was initially used as an activity location in the 12th millennium BP (i.e. &lt;2350 artefacts accumulated in that millennium), and it was not until the following millennium that a base camp was established there, which was then used until contact. Four long-term 'habitations' were not used as base camps until the 3rd and 2nd millennia BP. Only one 'habitation' was first used and established as a base camp in the 1st millennium BP (Mangrove Mansions). Of the 22 'habitations' used solely as activity locations, only one was initially used before 3000 BP - Kangaroo &amp; Echidna. This was established by at least 6700 BP, based on a I4C age at 28 cm depth. Extrapolation of this date to the base of the cultural deposit at 43 cm using a depth/age curve would place initial establishment at about 9800 BP, but here a maximum age of about 7000 BP is assumed. Most activity locations were first used in the last two thousand years - seven in the 2nd millennium BP and 1 3 in the 1 st millennium BP. Some may have been used only once, whereas others Figure 5 Upper Mangrove Creek catchment: number of base camps (solid boxes) and activity locations/ transit camps (blank boxes) used in each millennium. were used on numerous occasions over centuries or millennia. Even once established as a base camp, 'habitations' would have been used occasionally or frequently as an activity location on daily forays, or as a transit camp on long-distance trips for trade, ceremonial or other social purposes. Variations in the number of base camps and activity locations/transit camps in different periods (Table 4, Fig. 5) support the proposition that habitation patterns and subsistence organisation in the catchment altered substantially over the last 1 1 ,000 years, and that change of an unprecedented scale and nature occurred in the 3rd millennium BP. In this period a substantial increase in base camps occurred which contrasts with the lower number of locations used solely as activity locations/transit camps. The timing of this change, based on the size of the assemblages within 'habitations', differed from that of the dramatic increase in the habitation indices, which occurred in the 2nd millennium BP.

Most grinding groove sites (74%) are on Hawkesbury sandstone and are principally within periphery ridgetop zones (Fig. 2). Chronological assignment of these activities is based on the presence of ground implements and fragments in archaeological deposits dated to the last 4000 years, and increasingly in the last 2000 years when there is also a greater amount of igneous material in the assemblages (Figs 6 and 7). The distribution pattern of grinding grooves reinforces the proposition that activities were increasingly dispersed across the catchment in the last few thousand years. Unfortunately, the creation of pigment and engraved images cannot be incorporated into this chronology. Half of the images are on ridgesides above subsidiary creeks; the rest are relatively even distributed in each of the other zones except peninsula ridgetops. The only evidence indicating an age for pigment images in the catchment is outside the random survey units, in Dingo and Horned Anthropomorph, a shelter where red ochre, of similar colour to images on the shelter walls, was found in an excavated context dated to ca 580 BP (Macintosh 1965:85, 96-97). It is thus proposed that the number of activity locations/transit camps used in the catchment gradually increased until 3000 BP and then, after 2000 BP, there was a dramatic increase in number associated with the use of topographic zones not previously used or only infrequently used. Base camps were first established in the 11th millennium BP, but the number did not increase until the 4th millennium BP, with the greatest increase occurring in the 3rd millennium BP. Mobility In his forager-collector model, Binford (1980, 1982) described residential mobility and logistical mobility as organisational alternatives that could be employed in varying mixes in different settings. Logistical mobility was a strategy adopted by collectors in which residential bases were inhabited for relatively long periods, and task groups went out overnight or longer using field camps, stations and caches, and then brought resources back to base camps. Residential mobility related to the movement of people between base camps. It was a strategy used by foragers, Figure 7 Upper Mangrove Creek catchment: number and percentage frequency of igneous artefacts in each millennium. who had high residential mobility, in which people moved so that they camped near the resources they were exploiting. Residentially mobile groups operated within a foraging range around each base camp in which they used a number of activity locations, including hunting blinds and other special use sites (Binford 1982:7, 11, Fig 2). Field camps, stations and caches used by logistically mobile groups were beyond their foraging range, i.e., within a logistical range. Highly mobile foragers did not develop a logistical range, although occasional logistical trips were undertaken. Binford states 'with any condition that restricts residential mobility of either foragers or collectors, we can expect (among other things) a responsive increase in the degree of logistically organised production' ( 1980: 17; see also Nelson 1991:85). The several residential bases, with their associated foraging and logistical ranges used over the course of a year, were within an 'annual range' (Binford 1982:7). 'Long-term mobility' involved circulation through a series of annual ranges, perhaps every decade, and the country encompassing several annual ranges of a community formed an 'extended range' (Binford 1983:382-83). Binford's model, however, is not without problems and has often been applied too simplistically (Bamforth 1991; Bettinger 1991:71-73; Odell 1996:52-53; Lourandos 1997:19-20). Kelly (1992: 44-45, 50, 60) points out many different dimensions to mobility - individual mobility, group residential mobility, territorial shifts and migrations - each of which can vary independently of the others. He considers that it is not useful to speak of a continuum between mobile and sedentary systems, since mobility is not merely variable but multi-dimensional. The concept of residential mobility involves not just the movement between base camps but also the frequency of movements and distance (km) between them, as well as the duration of visits at base camps (or length of time between each move). It also involves the total distance covered in residential moves each year (Kelly 1983:278-79; Shott 1986:26; Andrefsky 1998:212), as well as the distance travelled from base camps in daily forays, which can vary in length according to circumstances. For example, the longer people stayed at a base camps, the further they had to travel each day to gain resources (Kelly 1992:46-47). Bettinger Australian Archaeology, Number 57, 2003 27</page><page sequence="9">Habitation and land use patterns (1991:72) queried Binford's claim that increasing population pressure would lead to an increase in logistical mobility (and a decrease in residential mobility), as surrounding populations would have restricted group movements. However, Australian ethnographic studies (e.g. Maddock 1982:42-47) show that controlled territorial boundaries are often countered by social mechanisms based on kinship and exogamous marriage rules which facilitate subsistence movements across boundaries. Binford's model also does not include a term for groups part-way along the continuum, e.g. those who are residentially mobile but undertake occasional logistical forays; the terminology in effect imposes a binary view of hunter-gatherer strategies: they are either foragers or collectors. As well, the foregoing models are based on ethnographic studies of communities inhabiting different environments to that of the Upper Mangrove Creek catchment and who are removed in time for most of the period over which the catchment was used. The subsistence organisation of groups using the catchment was probably quite different to that of the communities on which the models were based. Although the catchment 'habitations' have been provisionally assigned as base camps or activity locations/transit camps on the basis of assemblage size, it is more difficult to identify the degree of mobility or the mobility strategy/strategies under which they were formed. Part of the difficulty arises because the catchment is of a size (12 km by 10 km) that it would have been only part of the daily, annual or extended range over which groups operated (Higgs and Vita Finzi 1972:30-33; Foley 1981a:4-9; Binford 1982:7). However, intensive archaeological programs have not been undertaken in adjacent regions, and the location of base camps in these areas throughout the Holocene is not known. The closest excavated shelters to the catchment are Mogo Creek Shelter ca 7 km to the west in the Macdonald River catchment (Kohen 1995), and Upside-Down Man ca 18 km to the south in the Mangrove Creek catchment (McDonald 1994: Appendix 3). Both might have been within the daily or annual range of the groups using the Upper Mangrove Creek catchment. Mogo Creek Shelter was first used at least 2340 years ago (Kohen 1995:15). Its upper layer has a very large and diverse faunal assemblage but very few stone artefacts. Unfortunately, the upper deposits were highly disturbed. Upside-Down Man was first used about 4000 BP, but only after 1500 BP are total estimated numbers of artefacts (based on McDonald 1994 Appendix 3:264-66, Tables A3. 13 and A3 .24, Figure A3. 14) high enough to suggest it was a base camp at that time. People using the Upper Mangrove Creek catchment would have been relatively mobile hunter-gatherers - certainly in the recent past based on early colonial descriptions for the New South Wales central coast (e.g. Threlkeld 1826; Brayshaw 1986; Vinnicombe 1980; Attenbrow 2002) and probably also throughout the Holocene. Any variation in mobility patterns would have been closer to the 'forager' end of the spectrum than 'collector'. However, many details are not known for any period of time, even the historical period: (a) how long groups stayed at particular base camps or activity locations; (b) how many base camps people used each year; (c) how often groups returned to particular camps or activity locations; (d) how often people moved throughout a year from one base camp to another; (e) what distance they moved between base camps; or, (f) the size of the group/s (band/s) that visited the catchment. Groups may have varied in size and composition when in different parts of their range, according to resource abundance and social/ceremonial occasions. It is also not known how far they ventured out from base camps on daily foraging trips (their daily range); how often they undertook subsistence trips requiring overnight camps away from their base camps (logistical trips); or the size of their annual subsistence range. Oral histories indicate movements from Singleton in the Hunter Valley (ca 60 km to the north) via the catchment's eastern periphery ridgetop to Brisbane Waters (ca 28 km to the southeast), but we do not know the frequency of special purpose trips (e.g. to obtain raw materials or attend rituals/ceremonial functions) or whether people travelled yet greater distances. Each variable listed above would not have been constant, but may have varied over the course of a year, seasonally, in different environmental zones, and over the 11,000 years of catchment use. Many details will never be known. The nature of the changes in the distribution patterns of base camps and activity locations/transit camps in the catchment and whether they involved variations in residential mobility patterns as well as in the length of subsistence trips, cannot be established on presently available archaeological evidence. Rowland (1983:73) proposed that more short-stay briefly occupied sites may result after a change from reasonably stable and semi- sedentary activities to those based on greater mobility and more geographically or seasonally separated resources. However, for most of the 11,000 years, the location and nature of base camps outside the catchment is unknown and, therefore, the level of residential mobility of the group/s using the catchment, and the nature of any logistical trips undertaken, is uncertain. The evidence does suggest, however, that land-use patterns changed many times throughout the Holocene, as people re-organised their habitation, subsistence and manufacturing activities within the catchment. Conclusions and future research The provisional assignment of individual 'habitations' as either base camps or activity locations/transit camps, and their spatial distribution within the catchment in different periods suggest that changing land use patterns, involving shifts in subsistence and mobility patterns, may explain the dramatic late Holocene increases in the habitation indices. Very few base camps were established during the early Holocene, and it appears that it was not until the 4th millennium BP that more base camps began to be established in the catchment, at a time when ground-edged implements first appear. Nevertheless, the 3rd millennium BP stands out as a period when something different occurred, with a substantial increase in base camps and a reversal in the ratio of base camps to locations used only as activity locations or transit camps. The dramatic increases in 'habitations' in the last 2000 years appear to be almost totally due to increases in activity locations or transit camps, and not to increasing numbers of base camps. However, activity locations are not assumed to be associated only with logistical movements, and are thus not taken as indicators of logistical mobility and the transformation of foragers into collectors. The inhabitants of the Upper Mangrove Creek catchment continued to be 2g Australian Archaeology, Number 57, 2003</page><page sequence="10">Attenbrow relatively mobile hunter-gatherers throughout the Holocene. Even so, the continually changing 'habitation' distribution pattern indicates a re-organisation of mobility patterns (in the broadest meanings of the term) relating to camp life and subsistence activities took place in the catchment at frequent intervals and even more frequently and dynamically within the last four thousand years. The proposed model is only the beginning to understanding and interpreting the catchment's archaeological record, and writing the catchment's prehistory as it relates to habitation, subsistence and land use patterns. Further research is required on other data sets and in other theoretical contexts to establish its strength. As well as the habitation indices and habitation distribution patterns, the artefact assemblages and artefact indices need to be taken into account, no matter whether explanations involving demographic or behavioural change are being explored. Ideally, and eventually, it will be more fruitful to look at the various strands of the catchment's archaeological record together (cf. Nelson 1991: 57-58, 89-90): all archaeological traits and their assemblages, all materials and manufacturing processes and the tool -kit as a whole. Ultimately, they are all related - just as the behaviours and processes that created them were interrelated, as for example, the interconnectedness of mobility and risk, whereby the degree of risk involved in acquiring a certain resource may influence adoption of particular mobility patterns (Myers 1989:84, 90-91; Odell 1996:53; Torrence 1989:61-62, 2001:88). In the context of risk assessment, the influence of environmental change on the catchment's inhabitants and their likely technological responses to such changes must also be examined (cf. Hiscock 2002). Climatically associated environmental changes occurred throughout the Holocene, and included the final stages of the sea-level rise beginning ca 18,000 years ago. Such changes would have influenced the availability and abundance of food resources (plants and animals) not only within the catchment but also in the surrounding country and along the adjacent coastal shorelines. Thus, over time levels of risk in resource procurement would have changed regionally as well as within the catchment, and interpretations of the habitation and artefact indices need to incorporate the probability of regional populations redistributing themselves at such times. Before the foregoing can be examined, individual studies of different aspects of the assemblages (fauna as well as stone) are required in the context of behaviours with which they may have been associated. The assigning of individual habitations as base camp or activity location, presently based on the size of stone artefact assemblage alone, still needs to be validated. This will necessitate examination of assemblages in the habitations to identify activities undertaken in each. A more technologically- oriented analysis of the stone artefact assemblages may shed light on whether the variability and dramatic changes in artefact accumulation rates in individual habitations are due to changes in particular behaviours/activities or to 'intensity of site use' and ultimately to changes in the 'intensity of catchment use'. Subsistence tools and equipment would have been modified in response to changes in mobility strategies, levels of risk and access to or availability of raw materials (cf. Odell 1996:53). These behaviours may be reflected in the stone artefact assemblages and, as a consequence, the artefact accumulation rates in individual 'habitations' as well as local artefact accumulation rates. Habitation patterns by themselves, therefore, cannot be taken as the only indication of changes in mobility, irrespective of the area over which habitation patterns have been recorded.
