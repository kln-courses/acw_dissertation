<plain_text><page sequence="1">Gaia: Gender and Scientific Representations of the Earth MARCIA BJORNERUD Lawrence University Introduction Few ideas have provoked more rancorous debate within the modern scientific community than the Gaia hypothesis-the proposal that the Earth can be viewed as a superorganism with the capacity to regulate its "body" chemistry and temperature. Although the concept of the Earth as a living being is centuries old, the formal scientific development of that idea began in the 1960s when James Lovelock (an atmospheric chemist), Dian Hitchcock (a philosopher), and later Lynn Margulis (a molecular biologist) sought to account for the anomalous composition of Earth's atmosphere relative to those of neighboring Mars and Venus.' The pecu- liar mix of gases that envelops Earth and supports life on the planet, they argue, is the very signature of Life-created and maintained by the bio- sphere for its own use. The composition of the atmosphere, in turn, profoundly affects Earth's climate, which has remained favorable for life for at least 3.5 billion years. In other words, life on Earth has not merely adapted to a hostile environment, it has continuously modified that environment. The essence of the Gaia hypothesis, then, is that organisms have acted collectively (if unwittingly) throughout the history of the planet to make the global environment favorable for the biosphere as a whole. In the three decades since "Gaia" was first posited, the idea has evoked polarized reactions from mainstream scientists. Attacked with polemical opposition by the majority, it is acclaimed as a new geological paradigm by a growing minority. Gaia has also found its way into popular culture, where it has been embraced by environmentalists, ecofeminists and woman-centered spiritual groups. Why is Gaia so bitterly opposed by much of the scientific establish- ment? Is the concept a testable scientific hypothesis or little more than a metaphor? If merely metaphorical, does it still have a role in scientific discourse? Is science ever anything more than metaphor? How much has the male culture of science limited the range of acceptable metaphors for the natural world, and what effect has this had on our understanding of the Earth? To what extent is Gaia an affirmation of "female" values of com- munity and cooperation (vs. "male" values of individualism and compe-</page><page sequence="2">90 MARCIA BJORNERUD tition)? Is Gaia a reversion to medieval views equating women with nature (the very basis for the exclusion of women from Western science)? The purpose of this essay is to consider the Gaia hypothesis as a lens through which to view not only the Earth and the biosphere but also the roles of gender and culture in the evolution of scientific thought. Origins of Gaia In the 1960s, James Lovelock and Dian Hitchcock were consultants to NASA, charged with designing an instrument or method to detect whether there might be life on planet Mars. Lovelock and Hitchcock soon realized that such an instrument was unnecessary. Earth-based instru- ments had already shown that Mars has a "volcano breath" atmosphere, strongly dominated by carbon dioxide, with no sign of modification by life processes.2 Its thin atmosphere is "dead"; the mix of chemicals in it is exactly what one would expect if the exhalations of its extinct volcanoes had been allowed to evolve toward equilibrium. In their search for Mar- tian life, Lovelock and Hitchcock found themselves looking back at Earth. In striking contrast to that of Mars, Earth's atmosphere is not only wholly unlike volcanic emissions but also in a state of profound chemical dis- equilibrium, with easily oxidized compounds like methane and ammonia coexisting with abundant oxygen. Such a condition can be maintained only by continuous replenishment, and Earth's peculiar mix of gases bears the signature of replenishment by life processes: transpiration, respira- tion, digestion. Earth's atmosphere is not something whose existence is independent of the biosphere and merely exploited by it. Instead, the atmosphere is created by Life, like "a cat's fur, a bird's feathers, or the paper of a wasp's nest" not living but "a biological construction . .. an extension of a living system" (Lovelock and Hitchcock, qtd. in Barlow 1991, 1). In recent writings, Lovelock and Margulis have summarized Gaia in terms of the ways in which the concept changes our view of Earth and life (see e.g., Lovelock 1992; Margulis and Sagan 1995). In particular: (1) Gaia illustrates that life is a planetary-scale phenomenon that cannot exist sparsely (because organisms must be abundant enough to be able to regulate their environment); and (2) Gaia suggests that Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection should be enlarged to acknowledge (a) that organisms actively modify their surroundings rather than merely adapt to them and (b) that symbiosis (mutually beneficial cooperation between individuals of different species), not just competition, has shaped the course of evolution. Proposed more than a decade before the rise of "chaos" theory, the Gaia hypothesis was prescient in its notions of emergent properties of complex</page><page sequence="3">GAIA 91 systems-the idea that a whole (here, the global biosphere) can be much more than the sum of its parts (individual organisms). It also resonates with ancient views of Earth in its emphasis on the interconnectedness of life-forms and of the organic with the inorganic. In acknowledgment of this, Lovelock (at the suggestion of his neighbor, the novelist William Golding) chose to name the concept after the Greek goddess of Earth. Lovelock (1990) now admits that the selection of a female from ancient myth as the embodiment of the hypothesis has not hastened its accep- tance by the scientific mainstream. The Gaia concept was presented formally to scientific audiences, to little notice, in a short 1972 paper by Lovelock and two longer ones by Lovelock and Margulis and Margulis and Lovelock in 1974. A 1979 book by Lovelock, Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth, brought the Gaia hypothesis into the view of nonscientists and evoked sharp reproofs from scientific critics for its perceived poetic excesses. Lovelock tempered his language in a sequel called The Ages of Gaia: A Biography of Our Living Planet, but by this time "Gaia" had been classified as pseudoscience by prominent journals, including Science and Nature.3 A controversial 1988 conference sponsored by the American Geophysical Union4 was one of the first to examine Gaia from the perspectives of the scientific disciplines it touches: biology, geology, climatology, atmospheric chemistry, and plan- etary science. Since the conference, Gaian concepts have begun to enter models of regional and global biogeochemical systems but direct refer- ence to Gaia remains taboo. Papers that invoke Gaia-like biologically mediated feedback mechanisms rarely mention the hypothesis by name (e.g., Cappallen and Ingall 1996). Clearly, something about Gaia unnerves the scientific community. What is it? Objections to the Gaia hypothesis by the scientific community are of two types: (1) explicit critiques published in major scientific journals, attacking the hypothesis on the basis of conventional scientific criteria, and (2) tacit, perhaps even unconscious, rejection of the subversive sym- bolism of Gaia. The latter variety is, of course, harder to document but is ultimately more revealing of the pervasiveness of gender and culture politics in the scientific enterprise. What Science Says about Gaia Published critiques of the Gaia have appeared only relatively recently (beginning in the late 1980s, about the time of the American Geophysical Union conference), as the hypothesis began to be taken seriously by a small number of Earth and atmospheric scientists. Prior to this, the idea was not even part of scientific discourse. A summary of the principal scientific objections follows.</page><page sequence="4">92 MARCIA BJORNERUD 1. Gaia is teleological. It implies that the biosphere was designed with a purpose and is administered by some sort of omniscient entity. It is incompatible with evolution by natural selection. Lovelock, with An- drew Watson, countered this argument with "Daisyworld," a quantita- tive model that showed how individual organisms, carrying on their life processes independently, can have the collective effect of maintaining global homeostasis (a state in which environmental conditions remain nearly constant in spite of externally imposed changes to the system5) (see Watson and Lovelock 1983; Lovelock 198, 35-64). Daisyworld is an alter ego of Earth-like Earth in size and in proximity to a Sun-like star. This sun, like ours, is gradually increasing in luminosity. But unlike Earth, Daisyworld is populated only by daisies of different shades, from dark to white, with the capacity collectively to influence climate by absorbing heat (dark daisies) or reflecting it (light daisies). Early in the history of the planet, when the young Sun was still relatively cool, dark daisies would be the fittest species, because clusters of them would create local warm spots that would favor the growth of more daisies. Soon the planet would be covered by dark daisies, and their collective effect would be to increase the global temperature above what it would have been in the absence of life. Once the dark daisies had established a comfortable temperature, lighter daisies, arising spontaneously through genetic mutations, would have a chance to survive. As the Sun's output continued to increase, light- colored daisies would gradually become the fittest species because clus- ters of them would create cool spots that would favor the growth of more daisies. Ultimately, the Sun's heat would grow too great to be moderated by the daisies and the entire population would become extinct. Nonethe- less, the point is that the daisies acted collectively (but unconsciously), through differential reflectivity, to maintain planetary surface tempera- ture within tolerable limits for longer periods of time than would be the case if there were no biological feedback mechanisms. Lovelock subse- quently elaborated upon Daisyworld, introducing a continuous spectrum of daisy colors as well as daisy-eating rabbits, rabbit-eating foxes and periodic epidemics (1988, 52-62). The models show how, in theory at least, biological ecosystems governed by natural selection could alter the global environment. Critics argued, however, that Daisyworld was an absurdly idealized model and challenged Lovelock to find Gaian feedback mechanisms on Earth. One possible Earthly example is dimethylsulfide (DMS) production by phytoplankton in the oceans (see Charlson et al. 1987; Malin 1997). Studies in the North Atlantic have shown that DMS becomes oxidized in the atmosphere to create sulfate and particles that act as cloud condensa- tion nuclei. The latter increase cloudiness, the former cloud reflectivity, with the end result that areas of the ocean where these phytoplankton occur are cloudier and cooler than elsewhere, conditions that favor growth</page><page sequence="5">GAIA 93 of more phytoplankton. In a sense, the phytoplankton are making an "umbrella" for themselves. Because they are at the base of the oceanic food chain, this has profound global implications. Another, more familiar, example of a biologically mediated system is the rain forest. The climatic conditions that allow the rain forest to thrive are, in large part, a product of the forest itself. Leaf litter and other organic material from the plants and animals in the forest decay to produce a rich soil that provides nutrients and stores moisture to sustain the forest. Respiration by the lush vegetation creates a moist aura over the forest that assures its continued survival. Removal of the vegetation radically changes the chemical and hydrologic budgets: soil fertility, soil moisture, and atmospheric water vapor decrease, while surface runoff and erosion in- crease. Land use plans based on the assumption that these variables exist independent of the forest come to grief when the biological system that maintained those conditions is destroyed. Daisyworld, dimethylsulfide-producing plankton, and the rain forest are all examples of ecosystems in which biological mediation of environ- mental conditions occurs as a "by-product" of evolution by natural selec- tion. While some Gaia opponents still press the charge that the hypothesis is teleological (e.g., Williams 1992), most critics of Gaia now focus on questions about the degree and scale of biological regulation of geochemi- cal systems and whether it is even possible to gather data that would unambiguously affirm or deny the validity of the Gaia concept. This second generation of opposition includes the indictments that the Gaia hypothesis is "ill-defined, unparsimonious, and unfalsifiable" (Kirchner 1989, 223). Each of these will be considered in turn. 2. Gaia is an ill-defined hypothesis. James Kirchner, the most vocal critic of Gaia at the 1988 American Geophysical Union conference, ar- gued (see Kirchner 1992) that Gaia is not a single hypothesis but instead a collection of hypotheses ranging from "weak Gaia" (the idea that organ- isms influence their environments) to "strong Gaia" (hypothesis of global homeostasis maintained by and for the biosphere). In Kirchner's view, none of these hypotheses is useful scientifically. Weak Gaia, he argues, is unproductive because it is obvious: we have always known that organ- isms influence their surroundings. Strong Gaia, on the other hand, has limited scientific value because it lacks predictive power; in Kirchner's words, it can be "reinterpreted to explain almost anything" (1989, 223). Kirchner maintains that the various Gaia hypotheses are either "daring or viable, but not both" (ibid.). In other words, the viable versions (weak Gaia) explain nothing new while the daring versions (strong Gaia) do not qualify as scientific hypotheses. This leads naturally to the question of what criteria a scientific hypothesis must meet and brings us closer to the real issues underlying the Gaia debate.</page><page sequence="6">94 MARCIA BJORNERUD 3. Gaia is unparsimonious. Parsimony (simplicity) is one attribute, or "virtue," commonly required of hypotheses in Westem science (see, e.g., Kuhn 1977). Occam's Razor-the rule that scientific inferences should be as simple as the observations allow-itself seems a simple, easily prac- ticed principle. But what is simple to one investigator is complex to another. Interestingly, both Kirchner and Lovelock invoke parsimony in defending their views of Gaia. Kirchner asserts that Lovelock's vision of the coevolution of organisms and the environment introduces unneces- sary complications into Darwinian theory (1989, 233). Lovelock, in con- trast, sees Gaia as a liberating, simplifying worldview that "joyfully accepts the nonlinearity of nature without being overwhelmed by the limitations imposed by the chaos of complex dynamics" (1992, 10). Clearly, parsimony is neither a simple nor a sufficient identifier of scientific hypotheses. This and other scientific "virtues" are examined further later in this essay. 4. Gaia is not a scientific hypothesis because it can't be falsified. Sir Karl Popper's definition of a scientific hypothesis as one that can be falsified is probably the most widely accepted criterion among both prac- titioners and philosophers of modern science.6 As a result, charges of unfalsifiability have been taken seriously by Lovelock and other propo- nents of Gaia. Lovelock addressed the issue directly in a 1990 commen- tary, published in Nature, in which he listed six falsiflable predictions of Gaia (102). Two of these potentially falsiflable predictions, Lovelock argued, had already been shown to be true: the prediction of the absence of life on Mars and the hypothesis about the role of biogenic dimethyl- sulfide in regulating sea surface temperatures. The others-including the "post-dictions" that the Earth's early atmosphere was dominated by methane and that atmospheric oxygen levels have remained between 16 and 26 percent for 200 million years-are still being studied. The 1990 paper also marked an important turning point for the hypothesis. Its very appearance in Nature suggested at least partial acceptance into the scien- tific mainstream. Had Gaia adapted to its environment? Or had Gaia begun to change its environment? Perhaps both, but for the moment the environment remains quite inhospitable. Why Science Fears Gaia The published discourse on the Gaia hypothesis offers only occasional glimpses into the deeper misgivings that science has about Gaia. It is not surprising that Gaia evokes unease among Western scientists, because the idea challenges assumptions at the very foundations of the scientific edifice.</page><page sequence="7">GAIA 95 Exposing the Metaphor of the Machine First, Gaia calls into question the ubiquitous and therefore invisible assumption that all of nature can be explicated in terms of mechanical models. Beginning at about the time of Newton, scientific explanations became synonymous with mechanistic explanations.7 The hermetic tra- dition of "natural magic," which celebrated the power and complexity intrinsic to the material world, and which had thrived during the Middle Ages, became increasingly threatening to the Church. By 1600, hermeti- cism was equated with witchcraft and was punishable by death. Yet before this, science and hermeticism coexisted peacefully. Patriarchs of astronomy Nikolaus Copernicus and Johannes Kepler had embraced her- metic methods (Abram 1992, 67). Even Francis Bacon, usually identified as the founder of experimental science, was sympathetic to hermeticism. Newton himself was a lifelong student of the hermetic practice of al- chemy, though he publicly denied it. By the middle of the seventeenth century, the denunciation of hermeticism by the Church, together with the success of mechanics in both the heavenly realm (accounting for the motions of planets) and on Earth (liberating humans from hard physical labor), led to the ascension of the machine as the reigning metaphor in Western science. Women, seen as embodiments of the organic (the antith- esis of the mechanical), were systematically excluded from the new sci- ence.8 As the practice of medicine became increasingly mechanistic, the knowledge and skills of traditional midwives and healers-though de- rived from generations of empirical data-were rejected as superstitious and unscientific. Over the past three centuries, the "metaphor of the machine" (Abram 1992, 66) has rooted itself so deeply in the culture of science that few scientists ever question whether it is appropriate to attempt to characterize cells, bodies, brains, or planets as machines of one kind or another. The danger of the mechanical metaphor lies in its invisibility to scien- tists and even to those who reflect on the process of science. In a 1987 lecture, biologist and historian of science Stephen Jay Gould criticized Gaia by asserting that "the hypothesis says nothing new-it offers no new mechanisms. It just changes the metaphor, but metaphor is not mecha- nism!" (qtd. in Abram 1992, 66). Clearly, Gould fails to recognize that mechanism itself is metaphor. Gaia challenges the capacity of the me- chanical metaphor fully to characterize the complexity of the natural world and offers instead an alternative, organic metaphor for describing the Earth. Significantly, recent signs of tentative acceptance of the Gaia hypoth- esis by the scientific mainstream (e.g., Kump 1996) coincide with a shift in Lovelock's characterization of the hypothesis toward more mechanis- tic terms. He and other Gaia sympathizers, in what is probably a savvy</page><page sequence="8">96 MARCIA BJORNERUD survival tactic, now prefer to use the term "geophysiology" rather than "Gaia" to describe the scientific hypothesis (Lovelock 1992, 3) as a way of distinguishing it from the spiritual versions of Gaia).9 Physiology is a mechanistic portrayal of the human body, so although the term initially appears to depict the Earth in organic terms, "geophysiology" carries connotations of familiar biological control mechanisms and is thus more palatable to mainstream science. Questioning Fundamental Definitions Besides calling into question the reigning metaphor in modern science, Gaia challenges the accuracy of some of the most basic scientific defini- tions, raising doubts about whether defining certain concepts is even useful or meaningful. Science has long struggled to find a robust, universal definition for Life, but there are exceptions to almost every criterion that is put forth. 10 For example, the capacity to reproduce seems a fundamental characteristic of all living things-except that this would exclude sterile but indisputably living creatures like mules or worker bees. Another commonly invoked criterion is the potential to evolve through natural selection, but this definition would embrace viruses and even some dis- ease-causing proteins,"I entities that most biologists do not consider to be living organisms because they cannot exist in the absence of a living substrate and thus violate a third criterion-the capacity to be self-sus- taining. (Gaia itself poses a challenge to this last criterion by emphasizing that no organism is strictly independent of all others.) In spite of the difficulty of articulating exactly what is meant by Life, many biologists-including some who otherwise accept the Gaia hypoth- esis-continue to object strenuously to the notion that the Earth is in some sense alive. Gaia is typically weighed against the various criteria by which biologists recognize living organisms and is found to fail one or more of these tests.'2 Even Lynn Margulis, cofounder of the Gaia hypoth- esis and an iconoclast who has spent her career demonstrating the impor- tance of symbiosis in evolution, publicly rejects the idea that the Earth is alive "because no single living organism cycles its waste."'13 The failure of Gaia to meet such criteria seems tautological. Why would a global organ- ism be expected to match criteria constructed from the observation of individual species? Such an assumption ignores a priori the possibility that the global system could have emergent properties not present in its constituent parts.'4 Like the metaphor of the machine, the preoccupation with staking out absolute boundaries around concepts such as Life is deeply rooted in Western science (see Keller 1985, chapters 5 and 6). Erecting such bound- aries often creates artificial conundrums. For example, there is actually a logical contradiction in seeking an unambiguous scientific distinction</page><page sequence="9">GAIA 97 between life and nonlife, because if one accepts the scientific premise that life is "merely" a physico-chemical phenomenon, there should be no definite boundary between nonliving physico-chemical systems and liv- ing ones (see, e.g., Chyba and McDonald 1995). But setting up sharply demarcated dichotomies (e.g., life/nonlife) is essential to achieving the objectivism'5 so highly valued in the male culture of science. If such boundaries cannot be established, then the observer has too much latitude for subjective judgment-too much, at least, in a system that declines to acknowledge that the observer is always making judgments in the scien- tific process. In raising questions about the validity of fundamental definitions, the Gaia hypothesis meets several of the criteria proposed by Helen Longino as alternative, feminist "theoretical virtues"' 6 by which scientific theo- ries and hypotheses can be judged. Longino argues that some of the criteria traditionally invoked by scientists to decide "objectively" from among competing scientific theories are implicitly gendered and exclude a priori certain types of explanations. These criteria, used almost unconsciously by practicing scientists, have been enumerated and raised to orthodoxy by Thomas Kuhn, Karl Popper, and other philosophers of science. Most lists of theoretical virtues include (1) accuracy, or empirical adequacy; (2) internal consistency; (3) external consistency (i.e., consonance with the larger, existing belief system); (4) breadth of scope (range of explanatory potential); and (5) simplicity, or parsimony, which was mentioned briefly above (see Longino 1996, 42-43). Longino accepts the first two criteria as necessary to the scientific enterprise but she questions the validity of the last three, detecting the influence of gender values in both their application and, more signifi- cantly, in the assumptions that underlie them. The requirement of exter- nal consistency, for example, while superficially desirable, has a strong inertial effect on science and acts to discourage innovation in methods of inquiry. Since the existing lattice of scientific belief has been built by almost exclusively by male investigators, feminist theories will always face disproportionate rates of rejection under the criterion of external consistency. The criterion of breadth of scope is based on the reductionist belief in the existence of a few, simple universal Laws that will ultimately explain everything. But is such universality an intrinsic property of Na- ture or merely a culturally determined intellectual and aesthetic hope? Parsimony, as we have seen above, is notoriously difficult to measure, and its application often cloaks deeper, unproven assumptions about the relationships among natural entities. For example, models that involve power hierarchies and make sharp distinctions between passive versus active agents tend to be favored as "simpler," and therefore more scien- tifically sound, than models invoking feedback mechanisms or mutualis- tic relationships. Longino's alternative list of feminist criteria for the</page><page sequence="10">98 MARCIA BJORNERUD evaluation of scientific hypotheses includes (1) novelty; (2) ontological heterogeneity; (3) complexity of relationship/mutuality of interaction; (4) diffusion of power; and (5) applicability to current human needs (see Longino 1996, 45-49). Each of these will be considered in the context of the Gaia hypothesis. By suggesting that the boundary between life and nonlife is diffuse, fluid, and possibly scale-dependent, Gaia meets Longino's criteria of nov- elty and ontological heterogeneity. Indeed, Gaia's novelty-that is, its partial violation of the traditional criterion of consistency with external theory-is the very basis for its chilly reception by much of the scientific community. The concept of ontological heterogeneity is more subtle. In Longino's words, a theory that embraces ontological heterogeneity "grants parity to different kinds of entities . . . [rather than] treating different entities as versions of a standard or paradigmatic member of the domain" (1996, 46). Gaia suggests that it is fruitful to embrace a broader vision of what is meant by Life; that to force life into a single, standard procrustean definition is to sever it from its most essential qualities: subtlety, diversity, and connectivity. An even more subversive aspect of Gaia, threatening because it chal- lenges the mechanical paradigm, is the way in which the hypothesis blurs the meanings of cause and effect. As in other systems characterized by sensitive feedback mechanisms, dependent and independent variables cannot be disentangled in Gaia. Dimethylsulfide-producing phytoplank- ton thrive because of the cooling cloud cover above them and the clouds exist because bf the phytoplankton. "Driving force" and "control mecha- nism" -metaphors central to Western science (see Keller 1985)-cease to have meaning in such systems. Instead, simultaneity, mutuality, and coevolution emerge as defining characteristics. This aspect of Gaia is consonant with the theoretical virtue Longino calls "complexity of rela- tionship" or "mutuality of interaction." Citing the scientific work of Barbara McClintock, Ruth Bleier, and Anne Fausto-Sterling, Longino identifies a common approach that rejects "single factor models for mod- els that incorporate dynamic interaction, models in which no factor can be described as dominant or controlling and that describe processes in which all factors influence the others" (1996, 47). Inverting Power Structures Another heretical aspect of Gaia lies in how it reapportions power in scientific models of the Earth, in a manner consistent with Longino's criterion of "diffusion of power. " Traditional gender-laden notions of rank and hierarchy are turned upside down. First, Gaia liberates the biosphere from the passive, adaptive role to which it has been relegated since at least the time of Darwin and assigns organisms active roles in influencing the</page><page sequence="11">GAIA 99 global environment. In Gaia, life does not merely cling to an inhospitable rock but rather has shaped that rock into a commodious home through billions of years of assiduous global gardening and housekeeping. The evolution of the planet cannot be disengaged from the evolution of its life- forms. A second way in which Gaia redistributes power is by deposing organ- isms high in the food chain-lions, tigers, bears, dinosaurs, and humans- as kings of the beasts, for they play only bit parts in the great biogeochemi- cal cycles that maintain planetary homeostasis. Instead, microorganisms, as mediators of atmospheric and oceanic chemistry, are given leading roles. Size, strength, toothiness, and other conventional measures of rank are shown to be irrelevant on the global stage. Third, and most revolutionary, is the power that Gaia accords to coop- eration and symbiosis as forces in evolution. Darwin's vision of nature as "red in tooth and claw" is revealed to be inadequate for complete under- standing of either the plot or the characters in the 3.5-billion-year history of life on Earth. Lynn Margulis's most significant contribution to the biological canon has been to demonstrate that some of the critical stages in the early evolution of life on Earth involved symbiotic mergers between organisms. For example, the oxygen-processing mitochondria in our cells, essential to respiration, represent symbiont guests that moved into our ancient one-celled ancestors and stayed (Margulis 1981). Gaia posits that symbiosis-between species and also in a broader sense, between organisms and their environment-operates on a global scale, at and across all levels in the biological hierarchy, and has been as powerful a force in natural selection as ruthless competition. Indeed, symbiosis has recently been invoked as the resolution to the enduring mystery of the origin of the immune system in vertebrates. Biological and paleontological evidence suggests that the immune system common to modern chordates appeared, rather suddenly (in a geological sense), in early sharks more than 400 million years ago. In species that evolved before sharks, the signatures of vertebrate immune functions-antibodies and specialized proteins-are absent but in all lineages evolved from sharks, these entities are present. After three decades of struggling to understand how the immune system could emerge full-fledged in a mul- ticellular organism, immunologists John Marchalonis and Sam Schluter of the University of Arizona have recently proposed that gene swapping with symbiont species such as yeast or bacteria may be the answer.'7 The idea that symbiosis has shaped the evolution of "advanced" organisms remains an anathema to many biologists, however. If two species can merge to form a single functional unit, how are they to be classified? The distinction between self and not-self, central to Darwinian theory, be- comes blurred. Symbiosis, however, poses less of a problem to strict Darwinists than</page><page sequence="12">100 MARCIA BJORNERUD does evidence for cooperative behavior in animals. If natural selection is believed to operate only at the level of the individual, as mainstream biologists assert, then one is led to puzzle about what selective advantage there is for an individual to behave unselfishly. Altruistic behavior in humans and other animals becomes an aberration in need of explanation. Why, for example, do parasites often curb their virulence and spare their hosts? The "problem" of altruism evaporates when a Gaian view is adopted, because boundaries between individuals are less sharply drawn and natural selection is allowed to operate at the level of groups of organisms and species. The debate about whether or not group selection influences the evolution of biological systems remains one of the most contentious in modern biology.'8 (Indeed, the vision of competition and rugged individualism as the norm in the natural world bears startling resemblance to the cutthroat climate of biological research.) For advo- cates of group selection, the challenge lies in detecting empirical evidence for a phenomenon using research methods developed on the assumption that the phenomenon does not occur. Political and Social Implications of Gaia Another of Longino's feminist criteria for scientific theories is "appli- cability to current human needs" (1996, 48)-that is, relevance beyond the pages of academic journals. The extent to which Gaia is embraced outside the scientific realm indicates that the hypothesis fulfills human spiritual yearnings for a sense of connectedness with the planet and the deep past. In fact, James Lovelock has commented that he has been invited to speak as often from the pulpit as from the lectern. But Gaia also points the way toward new political and social strategies for bettering the human condition. Some of these have been discussed at length elsewhere (see, e.g., Thompson 1987); those that seem most relevant to the feminist agenda are considered briefly below. Culturally influenced depictions of Nature have long been used, reflex- ively, to justify political policies from laissez faire economics to institu- tionalized racism. The Darwinian paradigm of the solitary struggle for survival permeates almost every institution in Western society. Belief that ruthless competition is the rule in nature makes the same behavior in human society seem inevitable because it is "natural." Gaia provides an alternative to this despairing stance by offering a fuller palette of natural behaviors with which to compare the many shades of human interactions. Gaia carries economic implications in its emphasis on global bio- geochemical cycles. From the perspective of Gaia, the single characteris- tic that distinguishes human beings from the rest of the biosphere is that</page><page sequence="13">GAIA 101 we produce wastes that are not part of any global recycling system. Gaia makes a case for "green accounting"-economic acknowledgment of the full environmental costs of the production, use, and disposal of goods. If the global economy is to attain homeostasis, manufacturing must either incorporate these previously invisible costs into the price of commodities or leam to "close the loop" by cycling wastes back into production streams.19 Gaia reminds us that the root of both "economy" and "ecol- ogy" is the Greek word for "household" (oikos). Just as household budgets must balance, the global household account cannot be indefinitely over- drawn. Gaian concepts of mutuality, symbiosis, and dynamic feedback among organisms and the environment also have application in agriculture and medicine. The practice of "integrated pest management," in which natu- ral insect predators and repellents are used in lieu of pesticides, is begin- ning to be taken seriously even in mainstream agriculture (see Gardner 1996). It is finally becoming obvious that there is no prospect of human victory in the accelerating arms race between chemical pesticides and the pests that evolve apace with them. The paradigm of nature "red in tooth and claw" has backfired; in trying to vanquish our insect foes, we have created superior versions of them, while also poisoning our own food, water, and soils. A Gaian paradigm suggests that it is possible to live peaceably with pests, keeping them in homeostatic check by understand- ing the complexity of their interactions with other organisms and the environment. In medicine, similarly, applying a Gaian view to the "eco- system" of the human body makes it obvious that interventions based on the foe-vanquishing paradigm are inherently unsustainable. Continued use of antibiotics at current rates will lead only to increasingly virulent strains of bacteria by imposing stronger selective pressures on disease- causing microorganisms than nature would.20 New approaches must be sought in which equilibrium is maintained by balancing the effects of multiple agents rather than attempting to drive any one of them to extinction. One is tempted to speculate that this paradigm shift-toward acceptance of biodiversity in a wheat field and multiple approaches to treating disease-might have occurred earlier if the scientific community itself had been more diverse. The agricultural ideal of a pest-free monoc- ulture and the medical strategy of antibiotic blitzkrieg are reflections of the character and values of the scientific community that conceived them. Gaia offers a redemptive vision of how tolerance of diversity may be incorporated into the applied sciences. There is some irony in the idea that Gaia, a modern reincarnation of mother earth, represents the birth of a new kind of science that challenges conventional wisdom about power and priority; the same equation of nature and female was invoked at the time of the scientific revolution to justify exclusion of women from the scientific enterprise (see, e.g., Keller</page><page sequence="14">102 MARCIA BJORNERUD 1985, chapter 2). Women, being part of nature, belonged to the realm of the irrational. And Nature, being female, was to be dominated by men of science who would wrest her secrets from her, violently if necessary. Is there any danger in returning, even poetically, to the old metaphors?21 Are they permanently tainted by the misogynous ends for which they were appropriated? Modem science, though rooted in anthropomorphic (or more accurately gynomorphic) images of nature, now recoils from them- and in some sense has become impoverished as a result. Perhaps these rich, ancient images can at last be reclaimed as icons of empowerment without conjuring up the old meanings. Conclusion Is Gaia science? For the present, Gaia violates too many deeply rooted scientific taboos for the hypothesis to be embraced by conventional sci- ence. Nonetheless, a growing number of scientists are recognizing the power of its alternative worldview and following fruitful Gaia-inspired lines of inquiry. Is Gaia then "merely" a metaphor? Probably, but the same can be said for the pallid mechanical depictions of nature rendered up by traditional science. Is Gaia a feminist theory? In its celebration of diversity, its iconoclastic appropriation of power, and its central meta- phor of female dominion, the Gaia hypothesis seems rightfully claimed by feminists. Yet Lynn Margulis herself adamantly denies being a feminist (see Horgan 1996, 130) and James Lovelock has suggested that the attribu- tion of political significance to Gaia has eroded the meaning of the hy- pothesis (1990, 102). There is also the irony that characterization of nature as a mysterious, fecund female entity was part of the basis for the exclu- sion of women from science over the last three centuries. Thus Gaia, true to character, defies ready classification. But perhaps in this incarnation, she will ultimately find a room of her own in the halls of science.

For an account of the history of the Gaia hypothesis, see chapter 1 in Lovelock 1988. 2. Recently, indirect evidence for ancient microorganisms has been detected within a 1.3-billion-year-old meteorite believed to be of Martian origin (Mc- Kay et al. 1996). Many scientists remain skeptical of this interpretation,</page><page sequence="15">GAIA 103 however (e.g. Harvey and McSween 1996). Even those who support the pro- posal that the meteorite contains fossils from Mars concur that today the planet is barren of life. 3. See, for example, the portrayal of Lynn Margulis in Mann 1991. See also Margulis's letter to the editor of Science, published on 5 February 1993, describing the journal's repeated rejection of a paper emphasizing Gaian regulation of atmospheric and ocean chemistry by microbial metabolic pro- cesses. 4. The conference was organized by Stephen Schneider of the National Center for Atmospheric Research. An account of the difficulties encountered in gaining official sanction for the meeting is given in the preface to the confer- ence proceeding, published in the book Scientists on Gaia edited by Schneider and Penelope Boston (1992). See also Schneider 1990. 5. The term "homeostasis" is used in physiology to describe the ability of an organism to minimize fluctuations in internal factors like body temperature and blood chemistry, in spite of large fluctuations in external conditions (air temperature, food availability, etc.). 6. The criterion of falsifiability is discussed throughout Popper 1962. 7. This period has been discussed in detail by many feminist scholars. See, for example, Merchant 1980. 8. Again, see Merchant 1980; also Keller 1985, chapter 2: "Baconian Science: The Arts of Mastery and Obedience." 9. See, for example, http://gnv.fdt.net/-mother/gaia_index.html on the Intemet. 10. A thoughtful discussion of the elusiveness of such a definition can be found in Chyba and Macdonald 1995. 11. Proteins called prions have been identified as the agents causing bovine spongiform encephalopathy ("mad cow" disease). 12. See Barlow and Volk 1992 for examples. 13. Margulis, in a 1994 interview with science journalist John Horgan. Quoted in Horgan 1996. 14. For a good introduction to the concept of emergent properties in complex systems, see Capra 1996. 15. Keller's term, used to distinguish the self-denying objectivity of conventional science from the self-aware "dynamic objectivity" Keller advocates for a feminist science.</page><page sequence="16">104 MARCIA BJORNERUD 16. Ironically, "virtue" comes from a Greek word meaning "manly." 17. For a relatively nontechnical account of this work, see science writer Rosie Mestel's 1996 article "Sharks' Healing Powers." Interestingly, a November 1996 Scientific American paper that covers much the same ground as Mestel's but is written by a practicing immunologist makes no mention of the symbi- otic hypothesis of Marchalonis and Schluter. 18. For a recent update on the status of group selection theory see Morell 1996. 19. For a discussion of Gaia-inspired design in industrial and agricultural sys- tems, see Todd 1987. 20. For a lively discussion of this and other "revenge effects" see Tenner 1996. 21. Unfortunately, the old metaphors are still occasionally found in circulation. Here are the words of David Goodstein, Vice-Provost and Professor of Physics at CalTech, speaking last year at a Washington roundtable discussion on science and public policy sponsored by the George C. Marshall Institute and reprinted in the "Quotable" column of the Chronicle of Higher Education, 2 August 1996: "In the past, science was a competition against nature: Could we be clever enough to overcome nature, to find out her secrets by doing success- ful science? That is no longer the case, science today is a competition for resources, which makes it an economic, rather than intellectual competition" Works Cited Abram, David. 1992.
