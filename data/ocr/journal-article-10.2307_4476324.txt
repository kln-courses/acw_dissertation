<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME THEMES FROM GIGANTOMACHY IN THE 'AENEID'* I. The theme of the struggle of the gods for supremacy against monstrous divine or demonic opponents, as manifested in the stories of the Titans, the Giants, and Typhoeus, is one of the most popular in Greek mythology, and a recurrent subject for writers or artists seeking a topic suitable for the expression of grandeur or sublimity'. Its simple outline, the opposition between forces of order and disorder, or of good and evil, also made it eminently apt as an image for real or imagined struggles on a non- mythological plane, and it is found from early times with a transferred function, either in the form of a simple comparison, or of a more fully- developed allegory. In literature and art the most persistent (as it was also the most accessible) strand in the allegorical application of this group of myths was in the area of political ideology and panegyric2. This type of interpretation is of some antiquity, seen to splendid effect, for example, in Pindar's first 'Pythian'. By what may be an accident of survival Greek evidence is more plentiful for the visual arts than for literature, with the result that in many cases our conclusions as to possible allusions to historical events must remain speculative. This imbalance is particularly striking for the Hellenistic period: in the sculpture of the time there is a strong iconographic tradition which suggests that the successors of Alexander naturally turned to Gigantomachy as an image for their own victories (particularly those over barbarian races); but the loss of almost all the contemporary epic has removed an important control on our interpretation of the artistic remains3. In what follows I wish to examine a writer strongly influenced by Hellenistic ideas, Virgil, and to argue that themes from Gigantomachy are present at important points of the 'Aeneid', through an evaluation of both internal and external evidence. I * I am very grateful to Professor R. G. M. NISBET and Mr. J. C. BRAMBLE for comments and suggestions made on an earlier draft of this paper. In what follows I sometimes use 'Gigantomachy' as a shorthand way of referring to 'the myths of the battles against the gods of the Titans, the Giants, and Typhoeus', in contexts where ancient indifference to the distinctions is plain. 1 On the myths: M.

HARDIE restrict myself chiefly to two key passages in the first and eighth books, though the argument could be extended to include evidence from other passages4. II. The evidence for Virgil should be seen against the background of the use of Gigantomachy by his contemporaries. In literature allusions are frequent, particularly in the recusatio5; the reasons for this frequency might be more apparent if more Hellenistic literature were preserved6. But, whatever the immediate motivation for the selection of this particular topic of resounding epic in the earlier instances of recusatio, it is clear that in some of the later examples the theme becomes associated allegorically with the exploits of Augustus, and that this association helped to maintain its presence in the predominantly political recusatio7. The allegorical use of Gigantomachy to allude to Augustan supremacy is seen most clearly and directly in Horace's fourth Roman Ode. Ovid, true to his intention of flouting the rules of Roman Alexandrianism, includes a direct narrative of Gigantomachy in book one of the 'Metamorpho- ses' 8. It has been argued that behind the mythical account of the creation of the world and of the early Olympian victories Ovid intends us to understand the parallel creation of order and victory over evil by Augustus9. The Augustan historical epics are lost, but it is possible that they too may on occasion have used the image of the Gigantomachy ?. A subsidiary argument bearing on what is now lost may be drawn from the practice of later writers of 4 Most notably the Hercules and Cacus episode in Aen. 8; see V. BUCHHEIT, Vergil tiber die Sendung Roms (1963), esp. pp. 128 ff.; G. K. GALINSKY, The Hercules-Cacus Episode in Aeneid VIII, AJP 87 (1966), 18-51. s E.g. Prop. 2,1,19f., 39f.; 3,9,47f.; Hor.

INNES, Gigantomachy and Natural Philosophy, CQ N. S. 29 (1979), 165 - 171. 6 NISBET-HUBBARD, ii. 189, consider the attractive idea that the Gigantomachy motif in the recusatio may derive from a lost Hellenistic, possibly Callimachean, original; but note that Callimachus himself is not averse to drawing on Gigantomachy: e.g. Hy. 4,171 ff.; 5,7f. 7 Cf. S. G. OWEN, Tristium Liber Secundus (1924), ch. 4; V. BUCHHEIT, Mythos und Geschichte in Ovids Metamorphosen 1, Hermes 94 (1966), 80ff., esp. lOOf. 8 151 - 162; Gigantomachy also occurs at 5,319ff. 9 V. BUCHHEIT, art. cit. For the combination of universal history with political themes elsewhere in Ovid see the beginning of the 'Fasti', where Janus is shown presiding over the beginning of the Roman year, and hence associated with the world-rule of Rome (1,65ff.); immediately following this Janus delivers a philosophical account of creation, in which he himself plays a key-role, and which in turn is followed by the statement that he, Janus, has custody of the world (117ff.). See also P. 4,8,57ff, for a movement from the creation out of Chaos, through Gigantomachy and the triumphs of Bacchus and Hercules, to the achievements of Augustus. 10 See S. G. OWEN, Op. cit., p. 76.</page><page sequence="3">Some Themes from Gigantomachy in the 'Aeneid' 313 historical epic, Lucan, Silius, Claudian, in whom motifs of Gigantomachy become cliched, a method of emphasizing either the impiety of the enemies of Rome or the vast scale of the struggles involved. The evidence for Gigantomachy in the Augustan visual arts is less impressive'1. If this is a true reflection of the original density of visual representations, it may point to an interesting division between the stylistic canons of Augustan literature and Augustan art (at least of the sort intended for public edification); the baroque energy of Hellenistic ideology is admissible in verse, but has no place in the still solemnity of a work like the Ara Pacis. Speaking generally, it might be surprising if Virgil did not make a significant use of Gigantomachic themes; at least, in that case, he would appear to be something of an anomaly, to judge by the evidence assembled above. There are a few overt references to Titans and Giants in the 'Georgics' and the 'Aeneid', but taken on their own they are hardly more than incidental 12. A more productive method is to look not for specific names and incidents from the myths, but rather for thematic patterns and motifs. Virgil does not, typically, present his allegories in a clear-cut, independent form; instead he fuses together the immediate events of the narrative with the myths or stories that thus constitute, as it were, an internalized allegory of those events. ILL. The Storm in 'Aeneid' I. The description of Aeolus and the Cave of the Winds at 'Aeneid' 1,51 ff. has as its original model the Homeric description of the island of Aeolus in 'Odyssey' 5,1 ff. Virgil's divergences from Homer have often been pointed out, in particular the transformation of the dwelling-place of the winds, which appears to be largely a new creation in the Virgilian account13. 11 NISBET-HUBBARD ii. 190f. 12 Georg. 1,278ff. (incidental to an account of lucky and unlucky days); Aen. 4,178ff. (Fama a sister of Coeus and Enceladus); 6,580ff. (punishment of the Titans and Aloades); 8,298f. (Hercules and Typhoeus); 10,565ff. (Aeneas compared to the Hundred-hander Aegaeon). Cf. also the Britanni woven into the aulaea at Georg. 3,25, who would certainly be of gigantic proportions, as the British themselves were reputed to be of abnormal stature (Strabo 4,200): 'Gigantic' enemies of Rome? 13 On Virgil's innovation and manipulation of earlier material in this passage see esp. V. BUCHHEIT, Op. cit. pp. 59ff. W. H ROSCHER, Hermes der Windgott (1878), p. 20, attempts to reduce Virgil's description to a combination of the Homeric island of Aeolus and the belief that winds dwell on or inside mountains; but none of his references to caves approaches the conception of Virgil. Virgil may also be remembering the theory that earthquakes are caused by winds pent up inside the earth.</page><page sequence="4">314 P. R. HARDIE As BUCHHEIT observes, Virgil's picture of the imprisonment of the winds bears a resemblance to the imprisonment of the Titans in Hesiod's 'Theogony' (729 ff.): tvOa foi TITfiV&amp; ent6 V 6pq 0 F p6?vrt xExp3pwaTal Jiouxfjot Aot6 vpeXiiqpErTao XCDPCP ?V E6PWcSVTt, nlX(Pb1pf ?axaTa yatT14.

The similarities are more than casual: Virgil too stresses the providence of Jupiter in arranging the imprisonment of the winds (Aen. 1,60f.), although the architectural features of the Hesiodic prison are replaced by the more monumental mountain-masses, which were traditionally placed over the defeated Giants. The Hesiodic Titans are guarded by gaolers appointed by Zeus, as Aeolus is the warder of the winds (a far more authoritarian functionary than the Homeric Aeolus, described as tai.dli; dvtg.ov (Od. 10,21). In his description of the winds fretting in their subterranean confinement (Aen. 1,55 f.) Virgil may also have had in mind the Hesiodic description of the discontent of the Hundred-handers (Theog. 621 -623): eVO' ot Y' 61yE' tXOVTsg 6n6 XOOVi VcuFTadovT'c E1T(I' Fx' taXartl, DuaRn ;v nF' Fyi paat yating, 68Oat pad' dtxvV?voI, xpai8ii pt*ya it?vOog 9ovtr,. The actual words that Virgil here uses are of course based very closely on a passage in Lucretius (6,197ff.), and indeed the whole description of the Cave of the Winds is largely constructed out of Lucretian materials. But the ways in which Virgil diverges from his model are as significant as the similarities between the two poets. In the passage cited Lucretius is presenting a scientific, but highly-imaged, account of the winds enclosed in mountainous cloud- formations. The winds are compared to snarling beasts shut up in cages. Virgil is, deliberately, unspecific about the precise physical forms of his winds, but they are anthropomorphic rather than bestial (Neptune can use rational speech to them)14 14 The impression that the Virgilian winds are creatures inhabiting a moral world is strengthened by the clear echoes of their imprisonment and irritation in the description of Furor at Aen. 1,293 - 296.</page><page sequence="5">Some Themes from Gigantomachy in the 'Aeneid' 315 Lucretius is concerned with observed physical phenomena; Virgil with a mythical picture of Providence and the balance of cosmic order. This order is expressed by the image of Aeolus enthroned above and mollifying the chained winds (Aen. 1,58f.): ni faciat, maria ac terras caelumque profundum quippe ferant rapidi secum verrantque per auras. These lines also have a close Lucretian model (1,278 f.): (venti corpora caeca) quae mare, quae terras, quae denique nubila caeli/verrunt ac subito vexantia turbine raptant. Again observe the differences between the two poets: note in Virgil the hypothetical conditional construction; the substitution of caelum profundum for nubila caeli; and the addition of the words per auras, which changes the image of plundering from the several divisions of the universe to that of bodily carrying off the parts themselves of the universe. Lucretius describes actual violence in the physical world; Virgil imagines potential cosmic catastrophe. Intimations of cosmic disaster are found also at the end of the storm scene, where Virgil again draws on existing linguistic resources but gives them a new force. Caeli ruina at line 129 suggests the final disaster, and gains point if we remember that caelum ruere was a proverbial expression for an impossibility'5; here it threatens to become a literal possibility. A proverbial expression is also used by Neptune in his rebuke to the winds (133 f.) 16: iam caelum terramque meo sine numine, venti, miscere ... audetis ... Here again the effect of the unexpected use of proverbial language is to shock us into a realization that Virgil is not simply indulging in hyperbole. The identification of the Titans and Giants as elemental forces of nature, whose uprising threatens not only the hegemony of the Olympian gods, but also the structure of the physical cosmos itself, is encouraged by the Hesiodic Is Otto, Sprichwbrter s. v. caelum 7. The similar phrase ruit arduus aether at Georg. 1,324 also occurs in a storm treated with studied hyperbole; Lucan (2,290) borrows the phrase for a literal collapse of the sky.Caelum ruere occurs at Livy 40,58 with a more than figurative force in the reaction of the Bastarnae to a storm believed to be divinely instigated. On the primitive fear of the collapse of the sky see A. B. COOK, Zeus ii. (1925), pp. 54ff. 16 Otto, s. v. caelum 1. At Lucr. 3,842 the proverbial expression is also used in a shockingly literal way (see KENNEY ad loc.). The storm of Aen. 1 is remembered by Venus in her complaint to Neptune, 5,790: maria omnia caelo miscuit. Similar expressions are found in later Greek epic: e. g. Dionysius 'Gigantias' fr. 71,16 (LIVREA), sioeyaro 8`' pt 16vro4, and see LIVREA, P. 15, for later parallels.</page><page sequence="6">316 P. R. HARDIE accounts of the wars of the gods with the Titans and with Typhoeus. All the divisions of the universe are disturbed by the clash of the opposing forces (see especially 'Theogony' 693 ff.; 842 ff.). But the confrontations are imagined, at least partially, in anthropomorphic terms: the ranks of the Titans are described as (padayyag (676). Typhoeus is a more monstrous creature, but even his aim is lordship over men and gods (837), rather than cosmic destruction. The peculiar feature of Virgil's account of the winds is the presence of allusion to scientific explanation of the physical facts within a dominating mythical construction of vast forces controlled (or not controlled) by a superior providence. This kind of mix is also found in the allegorizing rationalizations of myth by the ancient philosophers and grammarians; the several mythological accounts of theomachy were particularly vulnerable to this cosmic reinterpretation, frequently in the direction of a physical exegesis.The evidence is chiefly preserved in late sources, but much of it is likely to derive from an earlier period. The older Stoa, in particular, is a prime candidate. The Byzantine commentators on the 'Theogony' preserve a tradition of meteorological interpretation in which the battles against the Titans and Typhoeus are taken to symbolize seasonally recurring struggles between cold and warm exhalations, in the course of which all parts of the world suffer disturbance. There is a strong sense of the precariousness of the balance of the cosmic order, an equilibrium maintained only by divine providence'7. I present a few passages from the Hesiodic commentators, whose relevance to the above discussion will be immediately obvious. Hesiod ascribes a personal motive to Uranos for the imprisonment of the Hundred- handers (Theog. 617 ff.); Triclinius interprets the Hundred-handers as the 17 The Byzantine commentators are collected in J. FLACH, Glossen und Scholien zur hesiodeischen Theogonie (1876). The divine battles are sometimes called gtXi t&amp;v cotoXi.ov (FLACH pp. 268, 271); welcome confirmation that this represents an old tradition is provided by a papyrus of the second century A. D. (P. Heid. SIEGMANN 194), a fragment of a treatise or commentary discussing (probably Stoic) allegorizations of myths (although the subject is here Gigantomachy rather than Titanomachy): gtot 8Olxo1ji TfCIV OTOCXEiCOV Oplo- AI?v Tfv gtXd1v, ol; Toi)c g5o6u4 dvKa&gt;a)XciTTsctv 900;, xOv rtydv- Trcv Tjv rtavd[otaotv (ex. gr.

The Hesiodic battles are interpreted as descriptions of the storms which accompany the seasonal opposition of elements, and storms on the grandest scale. A later poet, Nonnus, can also be seen incorporating the allegories of the commentators in his own reworking of the Hesiodic material. In the extended account of the rebellion of Typhoeus in book two of the 'Dionysiaca' we find a combination of the Hesiodic figure of the monster, with the meteorological interpretations of the scholia, as also the conceit that the struggle threatens the cohesion of the universe 18. References to Titanomachy in Nonnus present that battle too in terms of a storm19 IV. The Shield of Aeneas. The passage describing the Shield of Aeneas (Aen. 8,625 -731) is at once the most detailed presentation of episodes from Roman history in the poem and also one of the passages most highly charged with symbolic reference and allusion. Far more than simply a catalogue of 'res Italas Romanorumque triumphos' (626), it delivers a persuasive account of the rise of Rome virtually ex nihilo to a position of world-empire. One way of 18 See R. KEYDELL, Mythendeutung in den Dionysiaka des Nonnos, Gedenkschrift G. Rohde (1961), pp. 105 - 114. 19 The above discussion has concentrated on the contamination of a Homeric model for the storm with elements of a Hesiodic Gigantomachy. G. N. KNAUER, Die Aeneis und Homer (1964), pp. 174 f., points out that Virgil's storm also includes elements from the Laestrygonian episode in the 'Odyssey', in particular the verbal echo at Aen. 1,87 ('insequitur clamorque virum stridorque rudentum') of Od. 10,122f. (&amp;pap t xwax6c x6veoo xatc vrfct 6pwpei/ &amp;v8pdv 6kXufvov vr1xv 0'6g5a &amp;yvug4Eva0)v). Immediately preceding this in the Homeric passage is the description of the attack by the Laestrygonians, o6x dv8pccotv otx6Ota4, diXt ]Fyaolv 10, 120). The allusion is too indirect for the reader to pick up a Homeric Gigantomachy here, but may be taken as evidence of associations present in the mind of the author, Virgil. See further Knauer's speculations on the significance for Virgil of the phrase Cyclopia saxa (Aen. 1,201), ibid. p. 176, n. 2.</page><page sequence="8">318 P. R. HARDIE elevating Roman military history was to associate its triumphs with mythical or legendary battles: in the two sections that follow I examine from this point of view two of the most important scenes on the Shield. a) The Gauls on the Capitol aurea caesaries ollis atque aurea vestis, virgatis lucent sagulis, tum lactea colla auro innectuntur, duo quisque Alpina coruscant gaesa manu, scutis protecti corpora longis (Aen. 8,659- 662). The scene depicting the attack of the Gauls on the Capitol in 390 B.C. is the longest before the scene describing the battle of Actium, and it is also curiously elaborate. The effect of the profusion of colour-terms is to render it static, to lift it out of the continuous web of historical actuality; this in itself suggests that the scene has especial significance in the overall structure of the Shield. S. REINACH suggested20 that Virgil was here inspired by a prominent and recent artistic representation of Gauls, that on one of the doors of the Palatine temple of Apollo dedicated in 28 B.C. (Prop. 2,31,12- 14): . .. valvae, Libyci nobile dentis opus; altera deiectos Parnasi vertice Gallos, altera maerebat funera Tantalidos. REINACH'S suggestion can be developed further. We may presume that the relief was very familiar to the contemporary reader; we may also note that it is, in a sense, present on the Shield of Aeneas itself, to be visualized in the picture of Augustus sitting at the door of the temple (720): ipse sedens niveo candentis limine Phoebi. In the several scenes of the Shield Virgil alternates between a naturalistic use of colour-terms and a use which matches the colour of the object depicted to that of the medium in which it is depicted; in the scene of the Gauls there is a strong impression that he is visualizing everything in terms of a work of art, an impression produced chiefly by the heaping-up of words for gold. If this is so, then we should look for a material appropriate for lactea colla (660). It is true that the white skin of the Gauls is a feature remarked upon in ethnographical descriptions21; however, had Virgil wished to note this fact while restricting himself to the metals of the Shield, silver would have been a 20 Rev. Arch. 13 (1889), 351 f. 21 E.g. Diod. Sic. 5,28,1. Cf. Petron. 102.</page><page sequence="9">Some Themes from Gigantomachy in the 'Aeneid' 319 possibility for the assimilation of medium to object. Lacteus is quite inappropriate to any metal, but is frequently associated with ivory, as at 'Aeneid' 10,137f.: (quale) ... lucet ebur; fusos cervix cui lactea crinis / accipit et molli subnectens circulus auro22. This last passage also appeals to the visual effect of the juxtaposition of ivory and gold. There is no direct evidence for a closer reconstruction of the ivory reliefs of the Palatine temple but in respect to materials it is quite probable that so important a work would have been further adorned with gold, rather in the manner of chryselephantine statues in the round23: the distribution of materials in this technique was ivory for the skin and gold for the hair and clothing of the figures, just the distribution that we find in Virgil's description of the Gauls. Finally, it is precisely this combination that Virgil had himself projected for the doors of his temple of poetry at the beginning of the third 'Georgic' (26 f.)24: in foribus pugnam ex auro solidoque elephanto Gangaridum faciam victorisque arma Quirini. If the allusion to the ivory relief on the doors of the temple of Apollo was present in Virgil's mind, then we may take a step further and suggest that the significance of the scene of the Gauls on the Capitol is enhanced by the association of the repulse of the Galatians at Delphi with Gigantomachy, so that the implications of the preservation of Rome in 390 B.C. are widened beyond the assurance of the continuity of the city itself to a suggestion of a more far-reaching victory of the gods over their enemies. Little survives directly of the iconography which was developed around the miraculous preservation of Delphi in 279 B.C., but the evidence of Callimachus is sufficient to prove the currency of the Gigantomachic image (h. 4,172- 175)25: 22 These two passages appear to be the first uses of lacteus of flesh (T. L. L. s. v. lacteus, VII, 852,53). 23 On the use of gold and ivory see S. REINACH, art. cit., p. 351. For the ancients the contrast of the colours of gold and ivory, as of lilies and roses, is a common one: see Nisbet-Hubbard on Hor. C. 1,31,6; and, e. g., Lucr. 2,28; (Tib.) 3,4,37 ff. For an example of the combination of gold and ivory on temple doors: Cic. Verr. 4,124. 24 The proem to Georg. 3 in all probability alludes to the Palatine temple of Apollo which must have been nearly complete at the time of writing. See D. L. DREW, Virgil's Marble Temple: Georgics 111. 10 - 39, CQ 18 (1924), 195 - 201; L. P. WILKINSON, The Georgics of Virgil (1969), pp. 169f. 25 See also PFEIFFER on fr. 592. Possible sculptural groups celebrating the event: S. REINACH, art. cit., pp. 317 ff. A related image is found on a dedicatory relief from Cyzicus, dated to 277/6 B.

The visual evidence for such a mythologization of the Galatians is more plentiful for the Attalid victories of the later third century B.C., most magnificently in the remains of the Great Altar at Pergamum, like the Palatine temple of Apollo a grandiose celebration of the victory of a dynasty over the enemy outside. More explicit in its theme was the dedication of Attalus I on the Athenian acropolis. This took up and expanded earlier Athenian symbolism, with its representations of the legendary battles of the gods against the Giants and the Athenians against the Amazons, and the historical victories of the Athenians over the Persians and the Pergamenes over the Galatians26 Given the close links of Rome with Pergamum, first as allies and then as rulers, it is likely that this conglomeration of symbolism was well-known to the Romans from an early date27; it would be an easy step to see the miraculous preservation of the Capitol from the Gauls as an analogue to the miraculous overthrow of the Galatians who tried to scale Parnassus. The comparison might be encouraged by, if it was not originally responsible for, the identity of the name, Brennus, traditionally borne by the Gallic chieftain in command on both occasions28. b) Actium. The final scene on the Shield expands on the immediate occasion of the triple triumph of Octavian in 29 B.C. to give a grandiose (if unhistorical) picture of Roman empire under the Pax Augusta, its continuance guaranteed by the divine patronage of the city. It is therefore Galatian. In view of future developments it is relevant that we have evidence from precisely this time for Pergamene aid to the Cyzicenes in their defence against the Galatians: C. PICARD, Le Guerrier blesse de l'Agora des Italiens a Delos, BCH 56 (1932), 513ff. 26 Paus. 1,25,2. 27 A. TRENDELENBURG, BPW 18 (1898), 891 ff., 999, argues, with the help of an emendation, that Horace had seen the Great Altar, and that he describes one of its scenes at C. 2,19,21 ff. An early example of borrowing of Pergamene-type symbolism might be seen in a denarius of Cn. Cornelius L. f. Sisenna, of 102- 100 B. C., depicting Jupiter hurling a thunderbolt against Typhon (F. VIAN, Repertoire, no. 13); V. BUCHHEIT, art. cit. pp. 98 f., argues that this commemorates the victory of L. Cornelius Scipio over Antiochus, a war in which the Romans were allied with Eumenes II, the builder of the Great Altar at Pergamum. C. PICARD, art. cit., argues that the statue of a wounded warrior found in the agora of the Italians on Delos was part of a group showing the defeat of a barbarian by a goddess, erected in honour of Marius' victory over the Cimbri, and drawing on the Hellenistic iconography of theomachy as used to celebrate victories over barbarians. 28 See R.

The supernatural aspect of the battle is most obvious in the central description of the gods at war (Aen. 8,698 - 705). It is true that for this there is a Homeric model, the Theomachy in 'Iliad' 20, but the parallel is more remote than in many Virgilian adaptations of Homer. In the 'Iliad' the Olympian gods arrange themselves on two opposing sides, but their direct conflict is soon broken off, and they retire to watch the human battle. The Virgilian battle is between two quite separate races of gods, the Roman Olympians and the alien Egyptian divinities, monstrous and non-anthropomorphic (698): omnigenumque deum monstra et latrator Anubis. Further, it is reasonable to assume that the celestial struggle concerns not merely the future dominance of Roman or barbarian, but also the balance of power in heaven itself; the defeat of the Egyptians relegates the Egyptian pantheon to obscurity. In these respects an alternative model to Homeric Theomachy may be sought in Hesiodic Titanomachy or Typhonomachy, where the struggle is also between two different types of opponent, and where the prize is also government of the universe. In the later versions of Gigantomachy the opponents of the gods take on an increasingly bestial aspect (notably, for example, in some of the scenes of the Great Altar at Pergamum). Comparison of our passage with the explicit Gigantomachy of Horace's fourth Roman Ode is revealing (C. 3,4,49 - 64). There too the emphasis is not on the actual progress of the battle, but on the contrast between the two armies, the monstrous and undisciplined Giants and the Olympian representatives of controlled power, likewise with a special place for Apollo29. If we bear these considerations in mind, the resolution of the battle of Actium by Apollo, so far from being a frigid detraction from the achievement of Octavian, is seen as the almost inevitable conclusion; it is appropriate that this battle of universal proportions should be decided by a shot from one of the greatest of divine weapons, the bow of Apollo, which here assumes a function analogous to the thunderbolt of Jupiter in the defeat of the Giants or Typhoeus. Thoughts of moralized Gigantomachy may also be relevant to the presence of Minerva among the gods fighting at Actium. Minerva and Apollo are the two gods common to the Virgilian naumachy and the Horatian Giganto- machy. It is tempting, in both places, to see in Minerva a representative of 29 H. P. SYNDIKUS, Die Lyrik des Horaz ii., p. 67, stresses the ease with which the forces of unreason are defeated; one can compare the ease with which Apollo routs the enemy in Virgil: it is their own unreasoning terror which defeats the barbarians.</page><page sequence="12">322 P. R. HARDIE reason or wisdom, fighting on the side of the legitimate champion of Rome30. There is also a particular aptness in the presence of the goddess in a theomachy depicted on a shield. Perhaps the most famous shield in ancient art was that of the Pheidian statue of Athene Parthenos in the Parthenon. Its exterior carried a relief of Amazonomachy, while its interior was adorned with a painting of Gigantomachy, visible above the coils of the sculpted snake which nestled within the shield. This painting was frequently copied, both on representations of shields and on other objects, and was doubtless known to Virgil. Is it possible that in the broad planning of the themes of his Roman shield Virgil was influenced by the great sacred monument in which the Athenians had expressed their ideal of rational empire3'? The superhuman quality of the Virgilian description of Actium is also suggested in the image used of the two navies as they move into battle (Aen. 8,691 f.): alta petunt; pelago credas innare revulsas Cycladas aut montis concurrere montibus altos. As a parallel for this striking hyperbole commentators normally adduce the description of the battle in Dio: (50,33,8)32: cMxao v dv t'C, i6V Tta ytyv6gteva, ?S uXPa ?aXoI; O6gIotboaL, TsiXE,IV ntO v ij xai v11aot; noxIotig xai nxvalc tx eaX,aoyng ro0topxo0p)cVat oi3t oi 0 v 7ttoIfVvai T? tOWV CWXWp6V 6301tp i'irsipou xa'i tpujiat6g TtVO; AnMp5VTO. It is true that one of the factors determining Dio's comparision was the great size of Antony's ships (though even this is played down); but the real point he is making concerns the tactics of the battle, which approximated to those of 30 On this aspect of Athene-Minerva, and for an attempt to apply it to the fourth Roman Ode: W.

The Gigantomachic shield had possibly naturalized itself in Roman literature at an early date: E. FRAENKEL, JRS 44 (1954), 14ff., suggests that Naevius Bell. Poen. fr. 19 (MOREL), a description of images of Titans and Giants, refers to a Gigantomachy, and one possibly depicted on a shield of Aeneas. 32 The idea that the battle bore a greater resemblance to a land-engagement than to naumachy is found also in Plutarch, Antony 66,2: i1v ou'v n7,0opiaiq npoop(Jp?pS 6 dy&amp;v r6 &amp;X0vrlo pov Ei7retv, -retxoaxia.

Virgil, in the lines which follow, keeps to the duties of a war- correspondent in the description of the turreted ships and the flaming projectiles, but the image of the uprooted Cyclades and the clashing mountains has nothing to do with siege-warfare, and is indeed far removed from any ancient practice in battle, whether on land or sea. This is a conflict not of human forces, but of raw chunks of nature. It is in Gigantomachy that we find the closest parallels for the deployment of weapons of this character. One thinks of the piling-up of mountains by the Aloades, an incident which in later accounts becomes merged into a generalized narrative of Gigantomachy, or of the mountains imposed on the defeated Giants by the victorious gods. More immediately relevant are those Gigantomachic encounters in which, in the course of the battle, a Giant or god tears up an island or mountain to hurl at his or her opponent33; for example the incident in which Poseidon tore off and hurled at the Giant Polybotes a portion of Cos (which became the island Nisyros), a favourite subject in early Greek vase-painting34. Apollodorus provides a typical selection of examples of mountains and islands used as projectiles, as in the description of the battle of Typhon against Zeus [Bibl. 1,431: xaot gaX6[trvo; tl?pi r6v A'ijov 61a ICapXsv 6prl. Later examples are to be found in Claudian, whose fragmentary Greek and Latin Gigantomachies are the only survivors of a poetic genre which enjoyed popularity throughout antiquity. In the Latin poem there is a catalogue of the mountains torn up by the Giants as weapons (66 f.). Later on the islands fall victim: Mimas tears up Lemnos, and Porphyrion attempts to break off Delos (114ff.): ecce autem medium spiris delapsus in aequor Porphyrion trepidam conatur rumpere Delon, scilicet ad superos ut torqueat improbus axes. I dwell on this last passage because its implications provide a commentary on one of the details in the Virgilian comparison. Claudian proceeds to describe the horrified reaction of the places and divinities most nearly affected by this threat to Delos; the fragment breaks off at the point at which the island Delos herself appeals to Apollo to save the island which once received his pregnant mother. Part of her prayer is an implied appeal to a previous 33 Virgil also remembers Lucr. 4,138ff: nam saepe Gigantum / ora volare videntur et umbram ducere late, / interdum magni montes avulsaque saxa / montibus anteire et solem succedere praeter. The juxtaposition of Giants and flying mountains may be coincidence: or is Lucretius suggesting that it is cloud-simulacra such as these that are responsible for the details of the myth of Gigantomachy? 34 F.

HARDIE occasion on which Apollo gave her security (128): en iterum convulsaferor. This is a reference to the legend that Delos was a floating island prior to her reception of Latona35. Delos was the centre of the Cyclades, and the circle which they formed around this centre might be seen as a reflection of a harmonious, and more specifically Apolline, order. The disarrangement of Aegean geography described in revulsas Cycladas is thus an attack on Apollo himself, and in Virgil it is Apollo who later intervenes to turn the battle and restore order on the human and divine levels36. In Virgil the Gigantomachic image has a function greater than that of simple hyperbole, and hints at the idea that the security of nature itself is threatened by the scale of the conflict at Actium, with the further implication that the natural order requires the combined victory of Octavian and Apollo for its maintenance. The tendency to universalize the import of Actium is an extension of the exaggeration seen previously in the suggestion that the forces opposed to Octavian by Antony are those of the entire eastern half of the oikumene, an extension from the human to the physical level37. V. Thus far I have considered in isolation passages in which themes from Gigantomachy are to be detected. It is time to consider the implication of these themes for the wider structure and significance of the 'Aeneid'. The use of such themes in the Storm of the first book may be seen as complementary to other strands of symbolism which have been detected in this scene (chiefly, the opposition of the divine and the demonic, and the political overtones, as highlighted in the statesman simile of lines 148 ff.). We have already seen how the Gigantomachic allegory may operate at a number of levels: the political, the moral, the religious. Virgil here adds the cosmological level, for which he had good precedents in the Stoic tradition of allegorization. It is impossible to judge whether this level of allusion was present in Hellenistic uses of Giganto- 35 For other accounts of the legend see Aen. 3,75 ff., and R. D. WILLIAMS ad loc. 36 For this geographical orderliness see Callim. Hy. 4,300f.: 'Aotepiil Ou6cooa, ot ptv ntepi l'dg(pi rt viViot / xtxkv inotIjoavTo xai i;) Xop6v dtgpsoXdovTo. Further support for this interpretation is provided by Prop. 4,6,27 f. (a poem heavily indebted to Aen. 8): cum Phoebus linquens stantem se vindice Delon / (nam tulit iratas mobilis una Notos), where the incident is linked to a series of Apolline victories over evil. Propertius also uses the image of wild rock- throwers (v. 49): Centaurica saxa minantis; see NISBET-HUBBARD ii. 188. It is perhaps significant that Statius in his adaptation of the Virgilian passage replaces the Cyclades with Delos itself (Theb. 5,338 f.): abruptam credas radicibus ire / Ortygiam autfractum pelago decurrere montem. 37 See P. JAL, La Guerre civile A Rome (1963), for a collection and discusssion of material on the civil wars as a conflict involving most or all of the inhabited world (pp. 275ff.), and as threatening disruption of the physical cosmos (pp. 282ff.). An idea of a sympathy between human and natural orders is strongly present in the list of omens at Georg. 1,466ff.; it reaches an extreme development in Lucan's application of images of cosmic order and disorder to themes of civil war.</page><page sequence="15">Some Themes from Gigantomachy in the 'Aeneid' 325 machy, but a general consideration perhaps inclines us to the view that Virgil is here original, namely the emphasis in Augustan ideology on the universal supremacy of Roman empire, so that the cosmological and the political orders become interchangeable. Alexander was the only Hellenistic monarch in a position to make such claims; it is less easy to imagine such in, say, a Pergamene context. How does this interaction of the cosmological and the political work in the case of the Storm? At this early stage in the poem chiefly in a negative way. Virgil here introduces an idea of cosmic order and of the forces which threaten it. Aeneas (and by implication the destiny of Rome) is shown as exposed to these mighty forces, but as yet powerless to act towards the preservation of order. The chaos of the storm is checked by the intervention of Neptune, and his concern is only for the etiquette of the divine division of powers, not for the safeguarding of Rome's chances in the future development of history (Aen. 1,132ff.). It is a Gigantomachy in which Rome can take no decisive action, although the elemental equilibrium of the universe is seen to affect her most closely. This is all in contrast to the events depicted on the Shield of Aeneas, where the Roman hero is very much in control of the monstrous forces that threaten to disrupt the order of the world, and where the intervention of the gods is intended precisely to guarantee the political order for which Rome stands: it is here possible to talk of a 'Roman Gigantomachy' as that phrase might be used of Horace's fourth Roman Ode. It is no accident that Gigantomachic themes are concentrated in books one and eight, marking as they do the two limits of the historical development of Rome: on the one hand the near extinction of the individual Aeneas in the Storm, and on the other the expansion of Augustan power to fill the oikumene. This polar opposition is marked also in the two descriptions of the caves of Aeolus and of the Cyclopes, which are both presented as centres of immense elemental power, with the essential difference that in the first that power is combined with irresponsibility, whereas in the second it is the instrument of a divine providence. The similarities between the two passages on a closer level are striking. Both Aeolus and Vulcan are lords of mountain islands, beneath which their charges are active in caves (antrum: Aen. 1,52; 8,419,424). The monstrous wind-demons create unholy uproar in their mountain prison; the Cyclopes fill the spaces under Vulcan's island and Etna with the din of the forges as they go about their (divinely-sanctioned) business. The two islands are even adjacent in space, a point which Virgil emphasizes (8,416f: insula... iuxta ... Aeoliam ... /... Liparen) 38. Virgil 38 On Virgil's choice of Vulcano for the forge of the Cyclopes see EDEN on Aen. 8,416f.; ROSCHER i, 2073. Valerius Flaccus also stresses the fact that the two islands and their inhabitants are neighbours (1,579ff.): aequore Trinacrio refugique a parte Pelori / stat rupes horrendafretis, 22*</page><page sequence="16">326 MARGARETHE BILLERBECK also connects the productions of the Cyclopes with the forces of the storm; note the meteorological description of the parts of the thunderbolt: (Aen. 8,429 f.) 39: tris imbris torti radios, tris nubis aquosae addiderant, rutuli tris ignis et alitis Austri. In book one the storm-forces conspire to destroy Aeneas; in book eight the elemental forces, operating properly under divine control, are directed to the protection of Aeneas and to the creation of a symbol of Rome's greatness. This adds another dimension to the more obvious fact that the Shield of Aeneas (and of Rome) is created in the same workshop as the weapons by which the Olympians maintain control over the universe (and whose manufacture is temporarily put aside for the Shield of Aeneas).
