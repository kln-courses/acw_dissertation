<plain_text><page sequence="1">Privacy, Visibility, Transparency, and Exposure Julie E. Cohen't INTRODUCTION This essay considers the relationship between privacy and visibil ity in the networked information age. Visibility is an important deter minant of harm to privacy, but a persistent tendency to conceptualize privacy harms and expectations in terms of visibility has created two problems. First, focusing on visibility diminishes the salience and ob scures the operation of nonvisual mechanisms designed to render in dividual identity, behavior, and preferences transparent to third par ties. The metaphoric mapping to visibility suggests that surveillance is simply passive observation rather than the active production of cate gories, narratives, and norms. Part I explores this problem and identi fies some of the reasons that US privacy jurisprudence has been par ticularly susceptible to it. Second, even a broader conception of privacy harms as a function of informational transparency is incomplete. Privacy has a spatial di mension as well as an informational dimension. The spatial dimension of the privacy interest, which I characterize as an interest in avoiding or selectively limiting exposure, concerns the structure of experienced space. It is not negated by the fact that people in public spaces expect to be visible to others present in those spaces, and it encompasses both the arrangement of physical spaces and the design of networked communications technologies. US privacy law and theory currently do not recognize this interest at all. Part II argues that they should. Part III argues that the spatial dimension of the privacy interest extends to online conduct and considers some implications of that view for cur rent debates about expectations of privacy online. Part IV offers some preliminary thoughts on how the privacy interest against exposure might affect thinking about privacy self-defense. t Professor of Law, Georgetown University Law Center.

VISIBILITY AND TRANSPARENCY Within US legal culture, debates about privacy traditionally have reflected a relatively great concern with visibility and visual privacy issues. Over the last decade, the principal contribution of what has been dubbed the "information privacy law project"1 has been to refo cus both scholarly and popular attention on the other ways in which contemporary practices of surveillance operate to render individuals and their behaviors accessible in the networked information age. Yet the information privacy law project remains more closely tied to visi bility than this description would suggest; its principal concern has been with data trails made visible to others. And to the extent that the information privacy law project conceptualizes privacy interests as interests against informational accessibility, its grasp of the workings and effects of surveillance is incomplete. Surveillance is only partly about the gathering and dissemination of fixed, preexisting information about identified individuals. Designations like "at risk," "no-fly," "soccer moms," "business elite," and "shotguns and pickups" are not preexisting facts. Surveillance also depends importantly on other, information creating activities that lie outside the frame of visibility altogether. An implicit linkage between privacy and visibility is deeply em bedded in privacy doctrine. Within the common law of privacy, harms to visual privacy and harms to information privacy are subject to dif ferent requirements of proof. Of the four privacy torts, two are pri marily visual and two primarily informational. The visual torts, intru sion upon seclusion and unauthorized appropriation of name or like ness, require only a showing that the conduct (the intrusion or appro priation) violated generally accepted standards for appropriate behav ior.2 The informational torts, unauthorized publication and false light, are far more stringently limited (to "embarrassing" private facts and to falsity).3 To make out a more general claim to information privacy, some have tried to characterize collections of personally identified data visually, likening them to "portraits" or "images," but courts have resisted the conflation of facts with faces.4 The body of constitutional privacy doctrine that defines unlawful "searches" regulates tools that enable law enforcement to "see" activities as they are taking place 1 Neil M.

Information privacy skeptics have argued that the in formation conveyed by most individual items of personal data is too banal to trigger privacy interests. They have asserted, further, that pri vacy interests cannot attach to information voluntarily made "visible" as part of an otherwise consensual transaction. Under the influence of the information privacy law project, pri vacy discourse has changed. Many new legal and philosophical theo ries of privacy are organized explicitly around problems of informa tion privacy and "privacy in public." Some scholars assert a "constitu tive" relationship between flows of personal information and self development.6 Helen Nissenbaum argues that the collection and ag gregation of personal information disrupts expectations of "contextual integrity" by allowing presence, appearance, and behavior in different contexts to be juxtaposed.7 Drawing upon pragmatist philosophy and phenomenology, Daniel Solove argues that "digital dossiers" threaten a varied but related set of interests that are grounded in the logic of everyday experience.8 These theories suggest that the persistent theme of visibility in privacy discourse is a distraction from the more fundamental problem of informational accessibility. Although the theories differ from each other in important respects, an implicit premise of all of them is that databases and personal profiles can communicate as much or more than images. To the extent that privacy is conceived as encompassing a more general interest against accessibility, the adage that "a picture is worth a thousand words" requires rethinking. Visibility is an impor tant determinant of accessibility, but threats to privacy from visual surveillance become most acute when visual surveillance and data based surveillance are integrated, enabling both real-time identifica 5 See, for example, Kyllo v United States, 533 US 27, 29 (2001); California v Greenwood, 486 US 35,40-41 (1988).

And, for the most part, in formational accessibility does not result from a conscious decision to target particular individuals. Rather, accessibility is embedded in the design of social and technical institutions.9 Even as information privacy theorists have sought to shift the fo cus of the discussion about privacy interests, however, the terms of both academic and public debate continue to return inexorably to visibility, and more particularly to an understanding of surveillance as direct visual observation by centralized authority figures. Within popu lar privacy discourse, this metaphoric mapping tends to be organized around the anthropomorphic figure of Big Brother. Academic privacy theorists have tended to favor the motif of the Panopticon, a model prison proposed by Jeremy Bentham that consists of cells concentri cally arranged around a central guard tower, from which the prison authority might see but not be seen.10 Historically and also etymologi cally, the Panopticon suggests that direct visual observation by a cen tralized authority is both the most effective means and the best exem plar of surveillance for social control. It is not particularly surprising that the paradigm cases of privacy invasion should be conceptualized in terms of sight. The cultural im portance of visibility extends well beyond privacy law, and well be yond law more generally. Within Western culture, vision is linked metaphorically with both knowledge and power. The eye has served throughout history as a symbol of both secular and religious authority. The Judeo-Christian God is described as all-seeing, and worldly lead ers as exercising "oversight" or "supervision."H Cartesian philosophy of mind posits that objects and ideas exist in the "unclouded" mind, where truth is revealed by the "light of reason."12 In the language of 9 See, for example, Daniel J.

See, for example, Genesis 16:13. The all-seeing God figures prominently in the religious iconography of the Renaissance, and the linkages between vision, power, and knowledge con tinue in the subsequent secular iconography of the Enlightenment.

Claims of privacy invasion are claims about unwanted subjection to the knowledge or power of oth ers. Within this metaphoric framework, it makes sense for such claims to be conceptualized in terms of seeing and being seen. Yet this way of understanding privacy carries significant intellec tual and political costs. If it makes sense to conceptualize privacy problems in terms of visibility, it also makes sense to conclude that problems that cannot be so conceptualized are not privacy problems. As Solove observes, identifying privacy problems becomes analytically more difficult when there is no single Big Brother at which to point.13 Privacy doubters, meanwhile, often cannot get past the ways in which the practices that privacy advocates seek to challenge fail to align with the dominant metaphors. But knowledge, power, and sight are not the same. If "privacy" really is meant to denote an effective barrier to knowledge or the exercise of power by others, equating privacy inva sion with visibility assumes what ought to be carefully considered. Work within the emerging field of surveillance studies calls into question the implicit linkages between surveillance, visual observation, and centralization that the conventional metaphors for privacy inva sion have tended to reinforce. Scholars in this field have brought a variety of allied disciplines?including sociology, urban geography, communications theory, and cultural studies?to bear on the institu tions and subjects of surveillance. This work enables a richer under standing of how surveillance functions, and of what "privacy" interests might include. Much work in surveillance studies builds upon Michel Foucault's landmark study of the prison and its role in the emergence of modern techniques of social discipline.4 US privacy theorists have drawn on this work primarily for its discussion of Bentham's Panopticon, but have tended not to notice that Foucault offered the Panopticon as a metaphor for a different and more comprehensive sort of discipline that is concerned more fundamentally with classification and normali zation.15 One of his central insights was that in modern societies social discipline is accomplished by statistical methods.

It does not simply render personal information accessible but rather seeks to render individual behaviors and prefer ences transparent by conforming them to preexisting frameworks. And in seeking to mold the future, surveillance also shapes the past: by cre ating fixed records of presence, appearance, and behavior, surveillance constitutes institutional and social memory.9 Some surveillance theorists argue that surveillance in postindus trial, digitally networked societies is even more radically decentralized and resilient than Foucault's work suggests. Building on Gilles Deleuze and F?lix Guattari's work on systems of social control,20 Kevin Haggerty and Richard Ericson argue that the prevailing modal ity of surveillance is the "surveillant assemblage": a heterogeneous, loosely coupled set of institutions that seek to harness the raw power of information by fixing flows of information cognitively and spa tially.21 Surveillant assemblages grow rhizomatically, "across a series of interconnected roots which throw up shoots in different locations," and for this reason they are extraordinarily resistant to localized dis ruption.22 Of critical importance, the surveillant assemblage operates 16 Foucault, Discipline and Punish at 223 (cited in note 10). 17 Id at 207-17,222-27. 18 See David Lyon, Surveillance Society: Monitoring Everyday Life 33-35, 114-18 (Open University 2001); Oscar H.

In return, the surveillant assemblage demands full enrollment. An alternative approach to surveillance studies uses performance theory to interrogate the effects of networked databases on the per formance of identity. Performance theory melds the methodologies of speech act theory, which emphasizes the performative force of utter ances; cultural anthropology, which describes culture as arising through performance; and deconstruction, which regards language as encoding multiple texts rather than universal truths.24 Performance theorists argue that "identity" is neither fixed nor unitary, but rather is constituted by performances that are directed at different audiences.25 From this perspective, the problem with surveillance is that it seeks to constitute individuals as fixed texts upon which invariant meanings can be imposed.26 The struggle for privacy is recast as the individual's effort to assert multiplicity and resist "norming." This account empha sizes agency to a far greater degree than the Foucauldian and Deleu zian accounts. It too is concerned with normalization and transpar ency, but it argues that human nature is much more impervious to normalization and transparency than those literatures suggest, and that the subjects of surveillance are knowing and only partially com pliant participants in their own seduction. Unlike their European and Canadian counterparts, US privacy theorists generally have resisted making these connections between transparency, normalization, seduction, and fixity of meaning. Some US privacy theorists have argued that the collection and aggregation of personal information is harmful because it creates the potential for 23 Id at 615-16. 24 Canonical works in these fields include XL.

Antidiscrimination theorists have focused on the ways in which profiling intersects with harmful stereotypes about minority groups, but have tended to resist generaliz ing that insight to profiling and normalization more generally.28 Sur veillance theorists, in contrast, argue that the logics of transparency and discrimination are inseparable.29 They also identify a more funda mental inequality embedded in the logic of informational transpar ency. The transparency sought by surveillance runs only one way; it does not extend to the algorithms and benchmarks by which all indi viduals in surveillance societies are categorized and sorted. US privacy scholars' resistance to the theoretical approaches em ployed by surveillance studies scholars also is not especially surprising, as it is rooted in core commitments?to individual autonomy and to the possibility of value-neutral knowledge of human nature?that de rive from the tradition of liberal political economy within which US legal academics are primarily trained. Those commitments tend to foreclose other approaches that emphasize the mutually constitutive interactions between self and culture, the social construction of sys tems of knowledge, and the interplay between systems of knowledge and systems of power. They therefore require rejection of the docile bodies of Foucauldian theory, the assimilated denizens of Deleuzian systems of social control, and the fragmentary, protean selves posited by performance theorists. It is possible, however, to meld all three sets of insights about the function of surveillance with the more traditionally liberal concerns that have preoccupied US privacy theorists. One can choose to under stand liberal political theory and Foucauldian poststructuralism as delineating irreconcilable opposites, or one can understand them as describing two (equally implausible) endpoints on a continuum along which social influence and individual liberty combine in varying pro portions. As a counterpoint to the universalist aspirations of liberal political theory, Foucauldian theory seeks to cultivate a critical stance 27 See generally Rosen, The Unwanted Gaze (cited in note 7); Daniel J. Solove, The Virtues of Knowing Less: Justifying Privacy Protections against Disclosure, 53 Duke L J 967 (2003). 28 See, for example, Frederick Schauer, Profiles, Probabilities, and Stereotypes 22 (Belknap 2003); Deborah Hellman, The Expressive Dimension of Equal Protection, 85 Minn L Rev 1 (2000); David Cole, No Equal Justice: Race and Class in the American Criminal Justice System 16-27 (New Press 1999). 29 See, for example, Oscar Gandy, Jr., Data Mining, Surveillance, and Discrimination in the Post-9/11 Environment, in Kevin D. Haggerty and Richard V. Ericson, eds, The New Politics of Surveillance and Visibility 363,363-64 (Toronto 2006).</page><page sequence="9">2008] Privacy, Visibility, Transparency, and Exposure 189 toward claims to knowledge. ? Performance theory takes background social shaping for granted and focuses on the range of motion that it affords for the process of self-articulation through experimentation and play. Haggerty and Ericson's theory of the surveillant assemblage, meanwhile, seeks to cultivate a subtler appreciation of the affective dimensions of social control. In a society committed at least to the desirability of the liberal ideal of self-determination, these perspec tives on surveillance are important. In such a society, pervasive trans parency is troubling because it constrains the range of motion for the development of subjectivity through both criticism and performance, and it does not automatically cease to be troubling when the subjects of surveillance have indicated their willing surrender. This account of the relation between informational transparency and subjectivity is attractive, moreover, because it offers a useful per spective on philosophical differences among US legal theorists and philosophers about the ultimate value of privacy. Some theorists have asserted that privacy serves principally instrumental values, while oth ers are adamant in linking privacy deontologically to care for the (lib eral) self. Privacy performs both functions. Choices about the permis sible extent and nature of surveillance are choices about the scope for self-articulation; in a very real sense, they are what enable or disable pursuit of the ideal that the liberal self represents. For precisely that reason, they are also choices about the definition and articulation of collective identity. The account of privacy as relative informational opacity runs into difficulty, however, when we return to the problem of visual surveil lance in public places. In particular, an informational transparency framework for conceptualizing privacy harms suggests that purely localized visual surveillance is relatively innocuous. The real danger to privacy comes from databases; visual surveillance creates pressing privacy threats only when it is digital, networked, and combined with other sources of information. Yet the theory doesn't align with the practice: surveillance cameras produce effects that are experienced by real people as altering levels of experienced privacy. This suggests that the informational transparency framework is incomplete. II. VISIBILITY AND EXPOSURE Linking privacy to informational transparency tends to mask a conceptually distinct privacy harm that is spatial, and concerns the 30 Consider Bernard E. Harcourt, An Answer to the Question: "What Is Poststructuralism?, " (Chicago Public Law and Legal Theory Working Paper No 156, Mar 2007), online at http://ssrn.com/ abstract=970348 (visited Jan 12,2008).</page><page sequence="10">190 The University of Chicago Law Review [75:181 nature of the spaces constituted by and for pervasive, continuous ob servation. Those spaces are characterized by what I will call a condi tion of exposure. The term "condition" is intended to signify that ex posure is not a given but rather a design principle that in turn con strains the range of available behaviors and norms. Neither privacy law nor privacy theory has recognized an interest in limiting exposure uncoupled from the generally acknowledged interest in limiting ob servation, and in general we lack a vocabulary for conceptualizing and evaluating such an interest. Since the US legal system purports to recognize an interest in spatial privacy, it is useful to begin there. Doctrinally, whether surveil lance invades a legally recognized interest in spatial privacy depends in the first instance on background rules of property ownership. Gen erally speaking, surveillance is fair game within public space, and also within spaces owned by third parties, but not within spaces owned by the targets of surveillance. Those baseline rules, however, do not in variably determine the outcomes of privacy disputes. Expectations deemed objectively reasonable can trump the rules that otherwise would apply in a particular space. Thus, for example, a residential ten ant is entitled to protection against direct visual observation by the landlord even though she does not own the premises,31 and a home owner is not necessarily entitled to protection against direct visual observation by airplane overflight,32 nor to privacy in items left out for garbage collection.3 Employees sometimes can assert privacy interests against undisclosed workplace surveillance.34 For purposes of this essay, the interesting thing about the reason able expectations test is that it is fundamentally concerned not with expectations about the nature of particular spaces, but rather with expectations about the accessibility of information about activities taking place in those spaces. Even the exceptions prove the rule: Kyllo v United States?5 styled as a ringing reaffirmation of the traditional privacy interest in the home, in fact upholds that interest only against information-gathering technologies "not in general public use."36 Simi larly, although legal scholars disagree about the precise nature of the privacy interest, they seem to agree that cognizable injury would re 31 See Hamberger v Eastman, 206 A2d 239, 242 (NH 1964). See also Chapman v United States, 365 US 610,616-17 (1961). 32 See Florida v Riley, 488 US 445, 451 (1989); California v Ciraolo, 476 US 207, 214-15 (1986). 33 See California v Greenwood, 486 US 35,40 (1988). 34 See O'Connor v Ortega, 480 US 709, 713-14 (1987); Mancusi v DeForte, 392 US 364.369 (1968). 35 533 US 27 (2001). 36 Id at 34.</page><page sequence="11">2008] Privacy, Visibility, Transparency, and Exposure 191 quire the involvement of a human observer who perceives or receives information.37 Focusing on the accessibility of information also explains why no privacy interest attaches to most activities in public spaces and nonresidential spaces owned by third parties: persons who voluntarily enter such premises have impliedly consented to being seen there. In short, and paradoxically, prevailing legal understandings of spatial privacy do not recognize a harm that is distinctively spatial: that flows from the ways in which surveillance, whether visual or data based, alters the spaces and places of everyday life. The information privacy law project has tended to ratify this omission, precisely be cause its primary interest has been information rather than the bodies and spaces to which it pertains. Many information privacy theorists criticize spatial metaphors in privacy discourse, arguing that they muddy rigorous analysis of privacy issues in the information age.38 And this resistance too is rooted in the tradition of liberal political economy, which for the most part does not consider concrete, particu lar bodies and spaces at all. Yet resistance to spatialization in privacy theory leaves important dimensions of the experience of surveillance unexplained. Consider an individual who is reading a newspaper at a plaza caf? in front of a downtown office building. The building's owner has installed surveil lance cameras that monitor the plaza on a twenty-four-hour basis. Let's assume the cameras in this example are clearly visible, and clearly low-tech and analog. It would be reasonable for the individual to assume that they probably are not connected to anything other than the building's own private security system. Most likely, tapes are stored for a short period of time and then reused. The consensus view in US privacy theory tends to be that there is essentially no legitimate expectation of privacy under these circumstances, and that the surveil lance therefore should not trouble us. But those surveilled often feel quite differently. Even localized, uncoordinated surveillance may be experienced as intrusive in ways that have nothing to do with whether data trails are captured.9 Or consider the ways in which spatial meta 37 See, for example, Rosen, The Unwanted Gaze at 8 (cited in note 7); Lisa Austin, Privacy and the Question of Technology, 22 Law &amp; Phil 119,126 (2003); Ruth Gavison, Privacy and the Limits of Law, 89 Yale L J 421,432 (1980) ("[Attention alone will cause a loss of privacy even if no new information becomes known."). 38 See, for example, Solove, 90 Cal L Rev at 1094-95,1151 (cited in note 8); Lloyd L. Wein reb, The Right to Privacy, in Ellen Frankel Paul, Fred D. Miller, Jr., and Jeffrey Paul, eds, The Right to Privacy 25,26-27 (Cambridge 2000). The exception is Helen Nissenbaum, who does not criticize spatialization and whose "contextual integrity" framework for privacy accommodates spatial privacy interests.

See also Marc Jonathan Blitz, Video Surveillance and the Constitution of</page><page sequence="12">192 The University of Chicago Law Review [75:181 phors continually recur in discussions of privacy. Even in contexts that are not thought to involve spatial privacy at all, judges and scholars repeatedly refer to "spheres" and "zones" to describe the privacy that the law should attempt to guarantee.40 Because information-based analytical frameworks don't recog nize these dimensions of the spatial privacy interest, commentators operating within those frameworks tend to question whether they are "real." Yet that conclusion denies the logic of embodied, situated ex perience. Surveillance infrastructures alter the experience of places in ways that do not depend entirely on whether anyone is actually watch ing. Governments know this well; that is part of the point of deploying surveillance infrastructures within public spaces. It seems sounder to conclude that the information-based frameworks are incomplete. Conceptualizing the privacy interest as having an independently sig nificant spatial dimension explains aspects of surveillance that neither visibility nor informational transparency can explain. Work in surveillance studies suggests that direct visual surveil lance affects the experience of space and place in two ways that an emphasis on informational transparency doesn't completely capture. First, surveillance fosters a kind of passivity that is best described as a ceding of power over space. As geographer Hille Koskela puts it, vis ual surveillance constitutes "space as a container" for passive objects.41 She distinguishes the spatial shaping that produces "container-space" from the "power-space" constituted by panoptic strategies of normali zation, which depend on access to particularized information. But the "containerization" of space is itself a panoptic strategy. Panopticism in the Foucauldian sense is both statistical and architectural; it entails ordering of spaces to obviate the need for continual surveillance and to instill tractability in those who enter.42 Our newspaper-reading indi vidual cannot see whether anyone is watching her, but she can see that the plaza has been re-architected to allow observation secretly and at will, and that there is no obvious source of information about the sur veillance and no evident method of recourse if she wishes to lodge a Public Space: Fitting the Fourth Amendment to a World That Tracks Image and Identity, 82 Tex L Rev 1349,1374-98 (2004). 40 See, for example, Zablocki v Redhail, 434 US 374, 397 n 1 (1978) (Powell concurring) (observing that the Court's prior decisions establish a "sphere of privacy or autonomy" within the marital relationship); Griswold v Connecticut, 381 US 479,485 (1965) (describing a "zone of privacy created by several fundamental constitutional guarantees"); Dietemann v Time, Inc, 449 F2d 245,248-19 (9th Cir 1971). 41 Hille Koskela, "The Gaze without Eyes": Video-surveillance and the Changing Nature of Urban Space, 24 Progress in Hum Geography 243,250 (2000). 42 See Foucault, Discipline and Punish at 206 (cited in note 10); Julie E.

In Hohfeldian terms,43 the reconfiguration places individu als under a twofold disability: the targets of surveillance cannot en tirely avoid the gaze (except by avoiding the place) and also cannot identify the watchers. We can say, therefore, that surveillance alters the balance of powers and disabilities that obtains in public places. It in stills an expectation of being surveilled, and contrary to the conven tional legal wisdom, this reasonable expectation and the passivity that it instills are precisely the problem. Performance theory reminds us that individuals surveilled are not only passive bodies, and this leads us to the second way in which sur veillance affects the experience of space and place. Like identities, places are dynamic and relational; they are constructed over time through everyday practice.44 Surveillance alters important parameters of both processes. Building on work in feminist geography, Koskela argues that surveillance alters a sense of space that she calls "emo tional space." She observes that "[t]o be under surveillance is an am bivalent emotional event. A surveillance camera ... can at the same time represent safety and danger."45 This point contrasts usefully with US privacy theorists' comparatively single-minded focus on the "chill ing effect"; it reminds us that surveillance changes the affective di mension of space in ways that that formulation doesn't address. Marc Auge has argued that the defining feature of contemporary geography is the "non-place."46 Places are historical and relational; non-places exist in the present and are characterized by a sense of temporariness, openness, and solitariness.47 Auge does not discuss surveillance, but the distinction between places and non-places maps well to the affective dimension of space that Koskela identifies. Aug?'s critics observe that "placeness" is a matter of perspective; for example, airports may be places to those who work there, while wealthy residential enclaves may be non-places to those whose entry incites automatic suspicion.48 It may be most accurate to conceptualize "placeness" both as a matter of degree and as an attribute that may be experienced differently by different groups. Along this continuum, surveillance makes places 43 See Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld, Fundamental Legal Conceptions as Applied in Judicial Reasoning and Other Legal Essays 35-64 (Yale 1919) (Walter Wheeler Cook, ed). 44 See generally Henri Lefebvre, The Production of Space (Blackwell 1991) (Donald Nichol son-Smith, trans). 45 Koskela, 24 Progress in Hum Geography at 257 (cited in note 41). 46 See Marc Auge, Non-places: Introduction to an Anthropology of Supermodernity 75-115 (Verso 1995) (John Howe, trans). 47 Id at 77-86. 48 See generally Peter Merriman, Driving Places: Marc Auge, Non-places, and the Geogra phies of England's Ml Motorway, 21 Theory, Culture, &amp; Socy 145 (2004).</page><page sequence="14">194 The University of Chicago Law Review [75:181 more like non-places. Spaces exposed by surveillance function differ ently than spaces that are not so exposed. I will characterize the spatial dimension of the privacy interest as an interest in avoiding or selectively controlling the conditions of ex posure. This terminology is intended to move the discussion beyond both visibility and transparency to capture the linked effects of archi tecture and power as experienced by embodied, situated subjects. With respect to space, surveillance employs a twofold dynamic of contain erization and constraint to pursue large-scale behavioral modification. Koskela observes that surveillance makes public spaces less predictable for the watched.49 The relation is reciprocal: surveillance also attempts to make those spaces more predictable for the watchers. By altering the balance of powers and disabilities, exposure changes the parameters that shape the ongoing performance of identity, community, and place. The effects of exposure and transparency are complementary, and the genius of surveillance appears most clearly when one considers them together. Transparency alters the parameters of evolving subjec tivity; exposure alters the capacity of places to function as contexts within which identity is developed and performed. Surveillance di rected at transparency seeks to systematize, predict, and channel dif ference; surveillance directed at exposure seeks to prevent unsystema tized, unpredictable difference from emerging. III. Exposure Online This understanding of the spatial dimension of privacy is relevant not only to physical spaces, but also to the ongoing debate about pri vacy interests in online conduct. The mismatch between online con duct and fixed physical place is one of the principal reasons that pri vacy theorists have offered to support a purely information-based definition of privacy interests. Privacy skeptics, meanwhile, assert that whether or not online forums correspond to physical places, online conduct that is visible to others is not private in any meaningful sense. Both arguments overlook the extent to which online conduct and online surveillance are experienced spatially. Let us now zoom in on our caf?-sitting individual as she uses her laptop computer to explore the web, view and download "content," write pseudonymous blog posts, and send email. Privacy rules derived from ownership and expectation suggest that she can have no legally cognizable expectation of privacy in most of these activities. The soft ware is licensed, the communications networks are owned by third 49 Koskela, 24 Progress in Hum Geography at 250 (cited in note 41).</page><page sequence="15">2008] Privacy, Visibility, Transparency, and Exposure 195 parties, and it is increasingly common knowledge that online activities are potentially subject to pervasive surveillance by governments and commercial interests. Federal statutes carve out limited zones of pri vacy, but as their definitional frameworks are challenged by rapid technological change, those statutes more often serve to highlight the absence of a generally applicable privacy interest in online activity. Here again, the reasonable expectation standard begs the ques tion: when does surveillance of online activities change expectations in a way that we as a society should find objectionable? As the hypo thetical suggests, the question cannot be answered simply by invoking an expanded conception of the privacy of the home. Information pri vacy theorists have objected, rightly, that this move tethers spatial pri vacy interests to a fixed physical space and ignores the fact that many online activities occur outside the home. A privacy analysis for the information age must focus on something other than physical location. The question also cannot be answered by reifying communica tions networks as separate "spaces." Online "space" is not separate from "real" space. Communications networks are layered over and throughout real space, producing a social space that in totality is more accurately understood as networked space.50 Actions taken in physical space have important consequences online, and vice versa. In ways that "real" space does not, online "space" contains material traces of intellectual, emotional, and relational movement, but privacy law and policy must be crafted for those who live in the real world. A viable theory of privacy for the networked information age must consider the extent to which the "privacy of the home" has served as a sort of cultural shorthand for a broader privacy interest against exposure. The home affords a freedom of movement that is both literal and metaphorical, and that has physical, intellectual, and emotional dimensions: we can move from room to room, we can speak our minds and read whatever interests us, we can pursue intimacy in relationships. The advent of networked space challenges privacy theo rists to articulate a more general account of the spatial entailments of intellectual, emotional, and relational activities. By analogy to the home, we might envision a zone of personal space that permits (de grees of) unconstrained, unobserved physical and intellectual move ment. That zone furnishes room for a critical, playful subjectivity to develop. This account of spatial privacy matches the experience of privacy in ways that the purely informational conception does not. When the spatial dimension of privacy is understood in this way, it becomes easier to see that surveillance of online activities alters the 50 See Julie E. Cohen, Cyberspace as/and Space, 107 Colum L Rev 210,235-48 (2007).</page><page sequence="16">196 The University of Chicago Law Review [75:181 experience of space in the same ways that surveillance of "real" places does. From the standpoint of Foucauldian theory, surveillance of online activities is a logical extension of the panoptic gaze, and not only for purposes of imposing transparency and normalization. To be most effective, the "containerization" of space must extend to intellec tual, emotional, and relational processes conducted online. From the standpoint of Deleuzian theory, surveillance of online activities fur thers the goals of the surveillant assemblage; it hastens the conversion of bodies and behaviors into flows of data.51 As in physical space, ex posure of activities in networked space alters the affective dimension of online conduct. That process in turn affects the ongoing construc tion of self, place, and community not only on the network, but within networked space more generally. Other social and technological changes also can alter the balance of powers and disabilities that exists in networked space. Imagine now that our caf?-sitting individual engages in some embarrassing and un savory behavior?perhaps she throws her used paper cup and napkin into the bushes, or coughs on the milk dispenser. Another patron of the caf? photographs her with his mobile phone and posts the photo graphs to an internet site dedicated to shaming the behavior.52 This example reminds us that being in public entails a degree of exposure, and that (like informational transparency) sometimes exposure can have beneficial consequences.53 Maybe we don't want people to litter or spread germs, or to drive aggressively,54 and if the potential for ex posure reduces the incidence of those behaviors, so much the better. Or suppose our caf?-sitter posts her own location to an internet site that lets its members log their whereabouts and activities.55 This exam ple reminds us that exposure may be desired and eagerly pursued; in such cases, worries about privacy seem entirely off the mark. But the problem of exposure in networked space is more complicated than these examples suggest. The sort of conduct in the first example, which antisurveillance activist Steve Mann calls "coveillance," figures prominently in two different claims about diminished expectations of privacy in public. Privacy critics argue that when technologies for surveillance are in 51 See Haggerty and Ericson, 51 Brit J Sociology at 608-09 (cited in note 21). 52 See, for example, HollaBackNYC, online at http://hollabacknyc.blogspot.com (visited Jan 12, 2008); How Drunk Am I?, online at http://www.howdrunkami.com (visited Jan 12, 2008). See also Kevin Werbach, Sensors and Sensibilities, 28 Cardozo L Rev 2321,2325-29 (2007). 53 It also reminds us that online "space" and "real" space are not separate. 54 See generally Lior Jacob Strahilevitz, "How's My Driving?" for Everyone (and Every thing?), 81 NYU L Rev 1699 (2006). 55 See, for example, Twitter, online at http://www.twitter.com (visited Jan 12,2008).</page><page sequence="17">2008] Privacy, Visibility, Transparency, and Exposure 197 common use, their availability can eliminate expectations of privacy that might previously have existed. Mann argues that because coveil lance involves observation by equals, it avoids the troubling political implications of surveillance.6 But if the caf?-sitter's photograph had been posted to a site that collects photographs of "hot chicks," many women would understand the photographer's conduct as an act of subordination.57 And there is more than an element of bootstrapping to the argument that coveillance eliminates expectations of privacy vis-?-vis surveillance. This is so whether or not one accepts the argu ment that coveillance and surveillance are meaningfully different. If they are different, then coveillance doesn't justify or excuse the exer cise of power that surveillance represents. If they are the same, then the interest against exposure applies equally to both. In practice, the relation between surveillance and coveillance is more mutually constituting than either of these arguments acknowl edges. Many employers now routinely search the internet for informa tion about prospective hires, so what began as "ordinary" coveillance can become the basis for a probabilistic judgment about attributes, abilities, and aptitudes. At other times, public authorities seek to har ness the distributed power of coveillance for their own purposes?for example, by requesting identification of people photographed at pro test rallies.8 Here what began as surveillance becomes an exercise of distributed moral and political power, but it is power called forth for a particular purpose. The relation between surveillance and self-exposure is similarly complex. Exposure is a critical enabler of interpersonal association; indeed, some feminist theorists argue that we are constituted pre dominantly by our relationships.59 From this perspective, the argument that privacy functions principally to enable interpersonal intimacy gets it only half right.60 Intimate relationships, community relationships, 56 Steve Mann, Jason Nolan, and Barry Wellman, Sousveillance: Inventing and Using Wear able Computing Devices for Data Collection in Surveillance Environments, 1 Surveillance &amp; Socy 331,348(2003). 57 See Ellen Nakashima, Harsh Words Die Hard on the Web; Law Students Feel Lasting Ef fects of Anonymous Attacks, Wash Post A01 (Mar 7,2007); Jill Filipovic, Hi, I'm Jill, and Scummy Law School Sleazebags Have Gone after Me, Too, F?ministe (Mar 7,2007), online at http://www. fem iniste.us/ blog/archives/2007/03/07/wapo-calls-out-law-school-pervs (visited Jan 12,2008). 58 See Wayne Harrison, CU Posts Pictures of Pot-smoking Event: Reward Offered for In formation about People in Photos, ABC 7 News Online (Apr 28,2006), online at http://www.thedenver channel.com/news/9063737/detail.html (visited Jan 12, 2008); Texas Border Watch, http://www.texas borderwatch.com (visited Jan 12,2008). 59 See, for example, Jennifer Nedelsky, Law, Boundaries, and the Bounded Self in Robert Post, ed, Law and the Order of Culture 162,169 (California 1991). 60 See, for example, Julie C.

Surveillance cameras can represent an invitation to perform in ways that transgress stated or implicit norms or exaggerate imputed characteristics; by the same token, self exposure using networked information technologies can operate as resistance to narratives imposed by others.64 The performative impulse introduces static into the circuits of the surveillant assemblage; it seeks to reclaim bodies and reappropriate spaces. As this analysis suggests, interpreting self-exposure either as a blanket waiver of privacy or as an exercise in personal empowerment would be far too simple. Surveillance and self-exposure bleed into one another in the same ways that surveillance and coveillance do. As Jane Bailey and Ian Kerr demonstrate, and as millions of subscribers to social networking sites are now beginning to learn, the ability to con trol the terms of self-exposure in networked space is largely illusory: body images intended to assert feminist self-ownership are remixed as pornography, while revelations intended for particular social networks are accessed with relative ease by employers, police, and other author ity figures.65 Other scholars raise important questions about the origins of the desire for exposure. In an increasing number of contexts, the images generated by surveillance have fetish value. As Kirstie Ball puts it, surveillance creates a "political economy of interiority" organ 61 See generally Goffman, The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life (cited in note 24); Irwin Altman, The Environment and Social Behavior: Privacy, Personal Space, Territory, Crowd ing (Brooks/Cole 1975). 62 See, for example, Protect Your Privacy, Facebook, online at http://www.facebook.com/ sitetour/privacy.php (visited Jan 12,2008). 63 See McGrath, Loving Big Brother at 61-62 (cited in note 26). See generally Michael Warner, Publics and Counterpublics (Zone Books 2002). 64 See McGrath, Loving Big Brother at 14-16 (cited in note 26); Koskela, Webcams, TV Shows, and Mobile Phones at 206-07 (cited in note 26). 65 Jane Bailey and Ian Kerr, Seizing Control?: The Experience Capture Experiments of Ringley and Mann, 9 Ethics &amp; Info Tech 129,132,137 (2007).</page><page sequence="19">2008] Privacy, Visibility, Transparency, and Exposure 199 ized around "the 'authenticity' of the captured experience."66 Within this political economy, self-exposure "may represent patriotic or participa tive values to the individual,"67 but it also may be a behavior called forth by surveillance and implicated in its informational and spatial logics. These examples argue for more careful exploration of the indi vidual and systemic consequences of exposure within networked space, however it is caused. While the law should not ignore changing social dynamics, it also should not overlook or oversimplify their causes and effects. Exposure online is a matter of concern for the same reasons that exposure in "real" space is; indeed, as the phe nomenon of coveillance shows, the two cannot really be separated. IV. TRANSPARENCY, EXPOSURE, AND PRIVACY SELF-DEFENSE Finally, understanding privacy interests as including interests against both transparency and exposure raises questions about the efficacy of tools and practices for privacy self-defense. Modes of pri vacy self-defense directed solely at minimizing or equalizing visual or informational accessibility do not necessarily address the more gen eral problems of transparency and exposure. Even if tools for privacy self-defense were designed with these more general problems in mind, it's not clear that the effort would succeed. To see why, consider two general classes of privacy self-defense tools. The first consist of tools for "watching from below," or "sousveil lance." A leading exponent of sousveillance is Mann, who employs wearable cameras to document visual surveillance in progress. When challenged by property managers or security personnel, he answers that the cameras are not under his direct control, and that it's up to his "controller" whether to turn them off. Mann envisions sousveillance as a species of situationist critique of surveillance: it is a way to "chal lenge and problematize both surveillance and acquiescence to it."68 As political performance art, sousveillance is brilliant. At times, however, Mann also appears to envision the condition of constant sousveillance as a normatively desirable way of living in the world. He contrasts the "reflectionism" of sousveillance with top-down privacy regulation, which he characterizes as a "pacifier," and argues that sousveillance emphasizes equality and participation.69 That may be so, but sousveillance does not change the architectural conditions of sur 66 Kirstie Ball, Exposure: Exploring the Subject of Surveillance 4-5 (unpublished manu script, 2007). 67 Id at 1. See also Anita L. Allen, Coercing Privacy, 40 Wm &amp; Mary L Rev 723,743-45 (1999). 68 Mann, Nolan, and Wellman, 1 Surveillance &amp; Socy at 332 (cited in note 56). 69 Id at 333, 345-47. See also David Brin, The Transparent Society: Will Technology Force Us to Choose between Privacy and Freedom? 3-26 (Addison-Wesley 1998).</page><page sequence="20">200 The University of Chicago Law Review [75:181 veillance or the underlying inequalities that they reinforce. Nor does it challenge internalization of the condition of exposure; if anything, widespread sousveillance likely would produce the opposite effect. The second general class of privacy self-defense tools consists of tools for hiding from surveillance. For example, portable Faraday cages can shield embedded radio-frequency identification (RFID) chips against external scanning.70 Many privacy activists recommend that holders of RFID-embedded passports keep them in aluminum foil wrappers to prevent unauthorized capture of encoded personal information; one might do the same for one's EZ Pass transponder between transaction points. Other technologies enable anonymization of emails and blog posts; some privacy activists and entrepreneurs have envisioned anonymization becoming routine for a much broader range of online transactions and interactions. These examples illustrate that hiding from surveillance can be easy in some contexts, but they also illustrate that even a robust com mitment to hiding would be extraordinarily difficult for ordinary indi viduals to sustain in the face of routine practices of embedded com puting that pervade networked space. One cannot escape the fact that the RFID transmitter must be removed from its protective coating in order to serve its intended purpose, which might be one that the indi vidual wants or needs. At transaction points, the encoded information must be accessible, and at those locations the individual is exposed. Similarly, major commercial web sites generally are not configured to permit anonymous or robustly pseudonymous transactions. It is over whelmingly likely that transaction points will continue to proliferate. For most people, the rewards of hiding won't outweigh the conven ience of technologies like EZ Pass or the seduction of customer loy alty programs. Normatively speaking, it seems unfair to place respon sibility for hiding on individuals when the deck is stacked so defini tively against them. Focusing on the spatial dimension of the privacy interest reminds us that hiding carries other costs as well, and not only those costs that are conventionally recognized. In "real" space, hiding generally is not considered a socially neutral activity. Unless it's Halloween or Mardi Gras, we tend to presume that people who wear masks in public are up to no good. But we presume this in part because a wide range of middle options?degrees of de facto anonymity and pseudonymity? has usually been available. Currently online spaces, like real spaces, 70 See Faraday Cage, SearchSecurity.com, (Information Security Magazine, Dec 21, 2003), online at http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0?sidl4_gci942282,00.html (visited Jan 12,2008).</page><page sequence="21">2008] Privacy, Visibility, Transparency, and Exposure 201 support a variety of norms regarding "nymity."71 In some online spaces, nymity is the rule; in others, it occurs often enough to be un remarkable; in others, it is unimportant; in still others, it is perceived as creating risks that may threaten the community's reason for being. If forced or trivially easy identification became the norm, we might come to embrace more committed hiding in a broader range of circumstances. But, just as the nature of "real" space would change profoundly if eve ryone wore either a bar code or a mask, the feel of online spaces, and of networked space more generally, will change accordingly. The lesson of these examples is not that privacy self-defense is a bad idea, but rather that privacy self-defense alone can't neutralize either the institutional predicates of transparency or the architectural predicates of exposure. Privacy self-defense operates at the individual level, while sur veillance operates at the collective level. The informational and spatial logics of surveillance require a considered, collective response. Conclusion Within the discourse of privacy, the language of visibility both conceals and reveals. Understanding privacy as an interest against visibility/informational accessibility misses an important piece of the logic of informational transparency. The privacy interest against trans parency encompasses not only the individualized information that surveillance collects, but also the informational frameworks that it imposes. Yet the problem of visual privacy also points us to dimen sions of the privacy interest that a focus on privacy as relative infor mational opacity cannot explain. Privacy encompasses an interest in the structure of experienced space, and this interest is threatened un der conditions of visual or informational exposure. Both transparency and exposure are questions of degree; the law can't (and shouldn't) regulate every instance of either. But privacy law and theory should recognize them as independent harms, so that a conversation about possible responses can proceed. 71 Ian Kerr and Alex Cameron, Nymity, P2P, and ISPs: Lessons from BMG Canada Inc. v.
