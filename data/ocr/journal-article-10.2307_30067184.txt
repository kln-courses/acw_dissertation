<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ARGUMENT FROM DESIGN. THE argument from design is the name usually given to the inference from the order, harmony, and beauty of nature to a Creator of infinite wisdom, power, and love. It is a very old argument, and is to be found in Xenophon and Cicero, and all along the ages. It is usually associated in England with the name of Paley, who states it in his Natural Theology, but it was urged against D'Holbach by Voltaire passionately in his essay on God in the Philosophical Dictionary, and was very generally accepted until the discovery of evolution by Darwin, which he published to the world in 1859. It is my object to show that the theory of evolution, even if true to the uttermost and far beyond what there is as yet any proof of, is not opposed to this old argument for the wisdom and love of God, though it causes us to modify our way of stating it. Let us suppose the case of an ordinary man who had never been taught any religious truths, but had been well informed in all science and in the observation of nature. He sees an endless variety of things, but all are governed by a comparatively few great and regular laws. First he looks above him and sees the sun and the moon and the stars, all beautiful and sublime, all important factors in the utility and fertility of the world on which he stands, working the succession of day and night, of the recurring seasons and the tides, tides which purify all the waters of the seas. He finds that all these heavenly bodies, as they sweep along in their magnificent orbits, obey mathematical laws with the greatest exactness in relation to one another; the paths they traverse, circles, elipses, parabolas and hyperbolas, are all those mathematical curves which we call " conic sections." He next applies his mind to the original</page><page sequence="2">THE ARGUMENT FROM DESIGN. 301 elements of which all substances are composed, and he finds from chemistry that the laws according to which chemical substances combine can also be expressed in precise numerical terms. Again, he looks at the vegetable and animal worlds, and sees endless variety of organisms and living beings with organs strictly adapted to all the necessities of their existence; and so he passes on to consider man himself and his wonderful intellect, by which he has subdued, or is subduing, all things to his will and use. But far higher than this, man's lofty affections and aspirations, his moral nature, his will which chooses what course he will follow, and his conscience which passes judgement on his choice and actions as a judge sitting in his heart; man with his religions, and his arts of painting, poetry, and music. Thus reviewing the world and mankind, the observer asks himself: Whence came this varied, orderly and sublime universe ? And he answers: There must be a Creator and Ruler of all this who intended that things should be thus systematic. The order, the beauty, the progress prove design and purpose, and so prove the existence of an infinitely wise, loving and powerful Creator-a God of whom in intelligence, will and affections man is a faint adumbration, but who must be as much above man as the heaven is higher than the earth. This is the argument from design briefly summarized. Now, in the old statement of this argument, isolated proofs, as we may call them, of purpose or design were often insisted on : e.g., it was said that the hinge of the oyster must have been made for the purpose it fulfils of enabling the oyster to open and shut its shell, and that, just as the hinge of a door points to the fact that it was made by an intelligent carpenter, so the hinge of the oyster proves an intelligent Creator. And in the same way all the other exquisite harmonies between organisms and their surroundings, and manifold adaptations of means to ends, which the world is full of, were taken to</page><page sequence="3">302 THE ARGUMENT FROM DESIGN. be severally proofs of particular design which proved a great Designer. The Bridgewater Treatises traced these adaptations all through nature, in the hand and the eye, the heavenly bodies, the chemical combinations, etc., and were written by some of the leading men of the early Victorian age. But then came the theory of evolution. This asserts that all the organisms, animal and vegetable, which are so full of these wonderful adaptations and seeming particular designs, originated by a few simple laws from a few early forms or one primitive form; so that, given the existence of these few forms, the power of reproduction in them, and the fact of slight variations arising continually in their offspring, together with the facts that there is over-production and that they prey upon one another, then ihe law of natural selection will account for the falling-off of unfavourable variations of individuals, or even the variations of the parts and organs of individuals, and the preservation of favourable variations, or the survival in the intense struggle for existence of those fitted to their environment. Thus the striped member of the feline tribe, the tiger, could conceal itself more effectually among reeds and obtain its prey more easily; the mottled leopard, which most nearly resembled the parti-coloured shade of the forest, was similarly rendered nearly invisible; and therefore individuals so coloured tended to survive and breed offspring like themselves. So all through nature: the fish which most nearly resembled the bottom of the stream survived those that were not so protected; the birds most like the ground would crouch down in stillness and be passed by the bird or animal of prey; their chickens were like themselves-and so the partridge and the grouse were evolved. In this way it soon could be seen that all the wonderful particular adaptations of the structure and colour, etc., of animals or plants to their environment, instead of being severally instances of design or purpose, instead</page><page sequence="4">THE ARGUMENT FROM DESIGN. 308 of being made as they now are for the purpose they fulfil, were developed or evolved according to the law of natural selection or the survival of the fittest, i.e., the fittest animal in colour, strength, activity, keenness of sense, etc., or the fittest part of an animal, or the fittest plant to prolong its existence or breed vigorous young. This seemed like checkmate to the argument from design and was taken by many to be so. Agnostics and others who never favoured the argument from design before, now allowed that it had been unanswerable until Darwin discovered the origin of species. But they said evolution completely upset it. Huxley said that what struck him most on first reading the Origin of Species was the conviction that teleology as commonly understood had received its death-blow at Mr. Darwin's hands; and Haeckel said: "I maintain with regard to the much-talked-of purpose in nature, that it really has no existence but for those persons who observe phenomena in animals and plants in the most superficial manner." The author of a Candid Examination of Theism (quoted by Dr. Kennedy in Natural Theology and Modern Thought, p. 114), after dwelling on the old design argument as " magnificent," says sadly : " But now, how changed! XWe now behold a calamity advancing as a deluge, black with destruction, resistless in might, uprooting our most cherished hopes, engulfing our most precious creed, and burying our highest life in mindless desolation." This terrific bugbear is the theory of evolution. Let us return to our impartial observer of the world and its contents, and explain to him the theory of evolution, stating that it accounts for the appearances of particular designs and adaptations throughout nature. Would he not point to the evolution of vegetable life and animal life up to man and his mind as displaying one great design or purpose instead of an isolated instance here and there? The progress and advance upwards of all things, beginning, it may be, with a</page><page sequence="5">304 THE ARGUMENT FROM DESIGN. scattered nebula, and slowly and surely organizing all through millions of ages until man is born, what is this but a vast design ? And the process is still going on; man is but half made yet, and there must be "one divine far-off event, To which the whole creation moves." The old teleology (or argument from the existence of ends and purposes) may be discredited as taking individual adaptations and arguing from them, but the new teleology is a thousand times stronger; instead of design here and there, I now see design everywhere. The more science grows, the more do I see that law and order exist where chance or chaos was supposed to reign : the laws of chemistry show us now that all the myriad suns in the sky are made of the same sixty elements as are the sun and the planets of our little system; and if so they must be subject to the same laws, so that purpose and design and order are there also. What used to be called the fixed stars are now known to be subject to the law of gravitation and many of them to revolve in orbits. Moreover, the observer could also point to the beauty and sublimity of the cosmos as a proof of benevolent or conscious design, as Dr. Kennedy has shown in his Natural Theology and Modern Thought (Lecture iv., p. 139). The beauty and sublimity of the starry heavens, for example, have no use in the evolutionary sense; a beautiful star or sun does not survive over a dark sun because of its beauty. Neither is the beauty of the rainbow or the sunset or the sea and the coast, the mountain and the valley, touched by the theory of evolution; they do not arise or survive because they are beautiful, or because they elevate man's thoughts and feelings: and therefore they are direct proofs on an enormous scale of design or high purpose in the universe. Is there any alternative to this conclusion ? Does Materialism suggest itself as a probable explanation of</page><page sequence="6">THE ARGUMENT FROM DESIGN. 805 all this order and beauty and progress? Materialism from the time of Democritus to the present day explains all by a " fortuitous concourse of atoms." It asks us to believe that, given the original properties of things and the laws of their working, the law of Conservation of Energy and of Development by Survival of the Fittest, things have shaped themselves and merely grown by chance; there is no mind and spirit apart from matter; thought is but a function of the material brain as breathing is of the lungs; and for the same reason there need be no Infinite Mind behind the order of the universe. But we ask in reply: Whence arose this law of natural selection ? Where did the atoms come from, and whence did their order arise? Who impressed on atoms the properties they possess, their powers of combining in various ways? Why does natural selection result in order? Where do the variations of species come from? Natural selection may crush out the unsuitable variations, but it cannot produce the suitable ones. As has been said, no amount of chance combinations of an infinite number of letters could ever result in the production of the Iliad-although letters only exist for the purpose of forming words, and are therefore not a strict parallel to atoms-and if it was produced by chance, it would have no meaning unless there was present a mind to understand it. In the same way the order of the world can only exist for a mind that can appreciate order and can only have come from a mind that has conceived order and impressed it on the world. The manner in which Haeckel proposes to account for the origin of consciousness on materialistic principles is this: " Each atom has in it a certain quantity of force, and is in this sense endowed with a soul. Without the assumption of an atom-soul the commonest and most ordinary phenomena of chemistry are inexplicable; pleasure and pain, desire and aversion must be shared by all the atomic masses, for the movement of atoms can</page><page sequence="7">306 THE ARGUMENT FROM DESIGN. only be explained by attributing to them sensation and will.' Is it not a simpler explanation to say, one great Will orders the atoms, than that each atom has sensation, consciousness and will ? But even granting they have, who drills them and gives them unity and order ? It is obvious that Haeckel's explanation is not materialistic at all-it assumes the action of will on matter in every atom. This is all we want, but we prefer one simple hypothesis to his millions of atom-wills. Even granted the evolution of everything, starting from all the particles of matter spread out in the ether (which is now proved to exist everywhere) at an even temperature, who started movement in that primeval desert of atoms ? and when it was started, who gave it its laws ? Why did it give rise to whirlwinds or circular movements which separated it into suns and planets and give rise to varieties of temperature? If order is intrinsically in matter, if it is of its essence so that matter does not exist without it-and matter without form or order is only a metaphysical abstraction with no real existence-if matter really possesses these properties of movement, force, heat, evolution, systematization, if atoms consist of atomies or specks of force rushing round one another in inconceivable velocity, then we ask: How came these properties in the atoms ? And there is no other possible answer save the one. It was the great Force behind nature, the First Cause, the Creator. He gave matter or atoms these properties in order that He might from them evolve creation in all its glory, variety and beauty. In fact, " In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth." In the beginning God made everything in purpose and idea. He had before Him the whole design from first to last, and all time and the whole process of things is but the gradual realization of that purpose which first existed in the Divine Mind. SSecret of the Universe, pp. 77, 78, 8o.</page><page sequence="8">THE ARGUMENT FROM DESIGN. 307 Evolution itself is nothing but the laying bare of the one great design of creation so far as man's mind can grasp it, or at all events of that design as far as it has yet gone, and of the various steps by which it has so far been realized. Let me give a few quotations from rigorous evolutionists illustrating this view of the argument from design. Fiske in his book, The Idea of God (19oi0), says (p. xi.) : " The process of evolution is itself the working out of a mighty teleology of which our finite understandings can fathom but the scantiest rudiments." " We see enough," he goes on to say, " to assure us of the reality of this tendency, and we call it Purpose." There is an omnipresent Energy, and what is this but to say there is a living God dwelling in nature, carrying out this purpose? Fiske seems to say we cannot tell what this purpose is, and yet a little further on in the same book he attempts a partial answer: "The development of the highest spiritual qualities is the goal towards which God's creative work has from the outset been tending." So that although modern scientists have again and again rebuked Christians for placing man in the centre of the universe, and stated that this was merely the result of the old pre-Copernican system, which made our earth the centre of all things and immovable, with the sun and stars circling round it (as in Milton's poem), yet now Fiske, a rigid evolutionist, can say: " Man is replaced in his old position of head- ship of the Universe, even as in the days of Dante and Aquinas; for the Darwinian biology exhibits him as the terminal fact in the stupendous process of evolution, whereby things have come to be what they are"; and, " Man's appearance on the earth marked the last act in the drama of creation. . . . In the deepest sense it is as true as ever that the world was made for man and that the bringing forth in him of those qualities which we call the highest and holiest is the final cause (or design) of creation." Later on he concludes: " We</page><page sequence="9">308 THE ARGUMENT FROM DESIGN. conceive of God as psychical (i.e., having a soul-life), a Being with whom the human soul in its deepest sense owns kinship." Again, " In the story of evolution on earth we see all things working together through countless ages of toil and trouble towards one glorious consummation," viz. (p. 16o), " the production of the highest and most perfect psychical life." And according to this writer, not only is the whole scheme teleological (with a design before it), but " each single act of natural selection has a teleological meaning." We could not go much further than this, which practically says that all the adaptations existing, even the particular adaptations-the hinge of the oyster, etc;, which we were told mechanically resulted from the law of development-were intended to exist, and existed first in the purpose and design of the Creator. Fiske's view of the future is that it will see the perfecting of the creature thus marvellously produced, and that this again will consist in " the ever-increasing predominance of the life of the soul over the life of the body." This is the New Testament view to a great extent. Darwin himself was much pained because men said (what he at one time thought) that his theory of evolution overthrew the argument from design. When Asa Gray, the American botanist, wrote of him ten years after the publication of the Origin of Species and said, " Let us recognize Darwin's great service to natural science in bringing back to it teleology," Darwin wrote back to him, " What you say about teleology pleases me especially, and I do not think anyone else had ever noticed the point. I have always said you are the man to hit the nail on the head."' I must now notice some objections to the full force of this argument. It is said: Yes, purpose or design is plain in the universe, but you try and make the argument carry too much-you have loaded the facts with too heavy an inference. The facts, no doubt, 2 Life of Darwin, iii. i8g.</page><page sequence="10">THE ARGUMENT FROM DESIGN. 309 prove design, and discipline, and progress in accordance with some mysterious purpose, but they are not sufficient to prove absolute benevolence or infinite wisdom or power. A perfectly omnipotent Creator who is All-Wise and Loving would not have to adapt means to ends, or to contrive, or to try experiments involving many failures unfit to survive, or find it necessary to go through such immense periods of imperfection before reaching a high goal-one that is not even yet reached. Such a Creator could create a perfect world at once and place in it a perfect creature. Therefore there is a limit either to the power or the wisdom or the benevolence of the Creator. Here we are up against the mystery of the existence of evil or imperfection. Darwin says to Asa Gray': " I grieve to say that I cannot go as far as you do about design. I am conscious that I am in an utterly hopeless muddle. I cannot think that the world as we see it, 'this wonderful universe,' and especially the nature of man, is the result of brute force or chance." "I am inclined to look at everything as resulting from designed laws, with the details, whether good or bad, left to the working out of what we may call chance. Not that this notion at all satisfies me."' Again he says, " This is not logical with reference to an Omniscient Deity." He elsewhere speaks of "the difficulty from the immense amount of suffering and the a priori unlikeli- hood that an Omniscient Being should have willed the world as we know it." With regard to the first part of this objection we ask: Why should Omnipotence not plan and contrive.? Why should not an all-powerful God, who is also wise and loving, draw by love and persuasion rather than create a passive goodness in a being that would thus be rather a machine than a soul ? Is mere unlimited power com- pelling all things to its will the highest type of power ? ' Life, ii. 353. 4Ibid, p. 312. D</page><page sequence="11">810 THE ARGUMENT FROM DESIGN. or is it not true that while " it is excellent to have a giant's strength, it is tyrannous to use it like a giant "? The evidence of evolution all shows (as is pointed out by Bergson in Creative Evolution) that Life, or the great Power behind Nature, works in the humblest and gentlest manner. Life insinuates itself in the most lowly way into nature: it could, no doubt, force things, but it rather moulds them gently. This objection, as put by J. S. Mill,5 would seem to take the evidence of God's wisdom in adapting means to ends as a proof of His want of power, but Professor Flint answers, " Infinite power and wisdom must neces- sarily work under limitations when they originate and control finite things," and the limitations are voluntarily chosen by the infinite wisdom when it wills to stoop to finite things in a finite sphere. In fact, " according to this argument infinite power could not create a finite world at all, only a finite power could do so,"'' which is absurd. Then, as to the prevalence of suffering in creation: It is, of course, a very real difficulty, but we must beware of exaggeration or emotional arguments here. Tenny- son in In Memoriam, which he perhaps rightly calls " Confusions of a wasted youth," says that " Nature, red in tooth and claw With ravine, shrieks against man's creed " of a loving God. Fiske says: " In every part of the animal world we find implements of torture surpassing in devilish ingenuity anything that was ever seen in the dungeons of the Inquisition." Huxley speaks of the " myriads of generations of herbiverous animals which have been tormented and devoured by carnivores," of all being subject to the miseries inciden- tal to old age and disease and over-multiplication; and he concludes that since thousands of times a minute, were our ears sharp enough, we should hear sighs and groans of pain like those heard by Dante at the gate of Three Essays, p. 176. ' Flint's Theism (Igo2), p. 18o. SNineteenth Century, Feb. i888, p. 162 f.</page><page sequence="12">THE ARGUMENT FROM DESIGN. 811 hell, therefore the world cannot be governed by what we call benevolence. Now surely these arguments or question-begging phrases are emotional, exaggerated and fallacious. We must beware of the fallacy of composition. It is easy to pile up in fancy an immense heap of the sufferings of sentient beings and to say, What an infinity of misery ! But each individual gnat, or wild ox, or bird devoured by a hawk, has only to feel its own share-if it feels anything. If we could ask the spirit of a wild ox, Did you enjoy your life on earth, and how much did you suffer ? Supposing it to be a self-conscious being, which it is not, I believe it would have to answer, " My life teemed with the joie de vivre from beginning to end, and when a lion seized me and devoured me I felt no pain." Or of a gnat-it would reply, "I sang my little song and enjoyed my day of life, and when a swallow devoured me or the cold wind blew out my life I was not aware of the fact." Pain or evil is a rare exception in the life of an animal: in most cases there is not even a moment of pain in the whole career of animal, bird, fish, or insect. Again, Alfred Russell Wallace, who discovered evolution independently of Darwin, says in his book, Darwinism, "The supposed torments and miseries of animals have little real existence, but are the reflexions of the imagined sensations of cultivated men and women in similar circumstances," and " the amount of actual suffering caused by the struggle for existence among animals is altogether insignificant." He shows that they have no anticipation of death, which in men is a pain far greater as a rule than the reality. Then their watchfulness against their enemies- which is incessant and habitual, an ever-present instinct--is an enjoyable exercise of their powers. A hare that has just escaped sudden death by a dog will nibble the grass as if nothing had happened. You or I would not recover such a shock for months, if at all!</page><page sequence="13">812 THE ARGUMENT FROM DESIGN. Again, much evidence shows that violent deaths, if not too prolonged, are painless. Livingstone felt nothing, neither pain nor terror, when mauled by a lion, once it had shaken him; he was in a sort of dreamy stupor, and compared it to what patients feel under chloroform, seeing the operation and feeling no pain. Whymper, when falling on the Alps .500 feet and bounding from rock to rock, felt no pain, only a mild wonder what would happen next. You and I in a game of football have received kicks which hurt us for days afterwards, but which we did not even know of till after the game was over. So too, of course, with wounds received by men when they are fighting for their lives. Kay Robinson, in The Countryside, vols. i., ii., iii., says that in such cases we merely fall back into an animal state, which is an unself-conscious state; and he comes to the perhaps rather extreme conclusion that no animals are conscious of pain. The consciousness of pain certainly does not exist in organisms low in the scale of evolution, such as the sensitive plant, the sea anemone, the jelly-fish, the worm, or in insects; and if such a sense of pain had arisen in an animal it would unfit it for the struggle for existence; therefore all animals having it would be extinguished and the unfeeling animals alone survive. However this may be, the cases quoted show that even man, a highly sensitive creature, conscious of his feelings, suffers little or nothing after a sudden shock or when excited. What then can an animal seized for food suffer ? The animal that seizes it does so because it is hungry, and so the prey is devoured at once. Then again, animals which die of cold and hunger suffer little, if any, pain. I remember that lately miners who had been three whole weeks imprisoned starving in a mine declared they suffered very little after the first day or so, but got very sleepy, and when they came out they thought they had not been in for more than three or four days! When an animal gets hungry it has to</page><page sequence="14">THE ARGUMENT FROM DESIGN. 818 go and hunt; and hunger is not felt in times of excite- ment. To summarize Wallace's argument: If we can predicate conscious happiness of animals at all, most animals must enjoy their existence. They are born when food is plentiful and the climate suitable; they grow vigorously and have plenty of food; when full- grown their lives are a round of healthy excitement, varied with complete repose. They run or fly, eat, drink and sleep, and die in a moment painlessly, and so enjoy all the happiness they are capable of. We, by a kind of inverted anthropomorphism, project our own feelings and emotions into their nature; to us the very sight of torn limbs and blood is painful, and we have a horror of all sudden or violent deaths. Why ? Because we think of a life cut short, promise unfulfilled, and mourning relatives. This is all beside the point in the case of animals. A sudden death is best; the least alert and active are devoured; the highest types survive, and thus the struggle for existence tends to the maximum of life and enjoyment as well as the progress and evolution of the organic world. This is Darwin's own view. But the mystery of suffering is a more real mystery where man is concerned. He is the great exception in the whole of nature. We cannot, however, separate man's pain and suffering from the moral problem of man's sin. The problem of human suffering and sin is too deep for resolution; and, unless we postulate a future and eternal life, all our argument from design to a wise and loving Creator would be upset by the tragedies of human existence. We believe, and we logically believe, that because Nature points to a Personal and Loving God, man must be immortal. It God, who is all-powerful and eternal, is the Friend of Abraham, He will not let Abraham perish. Just as we, if we had the power, would keep those we love alive and with us-so He, who has the power and who loves His</page><page sequence="15">814 THE ARGUMENT FROM DESIGN. human children, will see to our survival to satisfy His Love. The poet's golden dream is really the strictly logical conclusion from any real theism :- " What ! have fear of change from thee who art ever the same ? Doubt that thy power can fill the heart that thy power expands ? There shall never be one lost good! What was shall live as before: The evil is null, is nought, is silence implying sound: What was good, shall be good, with, for evil, so much good more: On the earth the broken arcs; in the heaven, a perfect round." 8 If the latter sentiment of the unreality of evil is one which cannot be sustained, yet, when we view the sentient world calmly and without exaggerating the pains of animals, we are forced to admit that evil is certainly the exception and not the rule. It is, even in man, an occasional usurpation, and seeming or tem- porary defeat of the true law of his nature; and no devout mind has been quite unable to endure it in the hope of its future defeat. As far as the creation is subject to vanity, it is subject to it in hope that the pains of nature are the birth-pangs of a more glorious future which will bring full compensation. And so we con- clude that to the impartial observer of this present state of things there is no scientific objection founded on the process of evolution against the inference from the order, beauty, purpose or design in nature to an Intelligence who is infinite in power, wisdom and love, who exists as the Author and Sustainer of all things. It will not do to say this only proves a Designer of order and not a Creator of matter; for you cannot really * Browning, Abt Vogler.</page><page sequence="16">THE ARGUMENT FROM DESIGN. 815 separate matter and form. Atoms are but specks of force or conglomerates of specks of force when ulti- mately analysed, but no atom or atomy does or could (as far as we know) exist by itself; they only exist as forming part of an organized system, therefore there is no original matter apart from the cosmos. The Originator of the cosmos is the Originator of matter, which is an abstraction when separated from cosmos or form. If you say that the argument from design does not prove a Creator but only an Architect, your mind is in bondage to a " concept," as Bergson would say, a barren creation of man's intelligence, though one which is useful if not employed as anything more than a rough symbol of an artificial distinction. You are taking it too seriously. You are thinking of " matter " as a carpenter thinks of the wood he makes a chair out of. Matter does not exist in that sense; it is organized from the first; it is all form or organized force; the Designer is the Originator of all: nothing exists except what He has designed in its various stages from nebula to perfect world. Thus it is true that "the invisible things (or attributes) of Him since the creation of the world are clearly seen, being perceived through the things that are made, even His everlasting power and divinity."
