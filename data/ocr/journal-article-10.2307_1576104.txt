<plain_text><page sequence="1">EDUCATIONAL PERSPECTIVE "Musical Graphics" as an Instrument for Musicologists and Educators Irina L. Vanechkina Visualization of certain characteristics of electri- cal and magnetic fields and of mechanical and thermal het- erogeneities is used in scientific research to make the ana- lyzed phenomenon visual and thereby aid the processes of fixing, observing and measuring it. The study of acoustics- specifically, musical acoustics-makes use of this universal and convenient method as well [1]. Moreover, this method can also be applied in other closely associated areas-music theory, musical psychology and education. Experiments with non-instrumental methods of visualizing the dynamics of different musical characteristics-i.e. visual- izations that are made, so to speak, "by hand," such as those used by S. Taneyev, G. Konyus and D. Lifschits for the graphic depiction of volume change, change of melodics, tonal plans, architectonics and the shape of musical works [2]-are close to the above-mentioned forms of experimentation. In these cases the investigators exceeded the bounds of merely physi- cal analysis and took into account the psychological and aes- thetic parameters of music. More recently, composers of elec- tronic music have found it necessary to use some form of graphics as a substitute for conventional music notation, which cannot sufficiently convey their creative work. Finally, there is yet another area called "musical graphics," which involves methods of painting and drawing music (gen- erally resulting in abstract visual compositions). These meth- ods were first used for educational and psychological pur- poses by 0. Rainer, an Austrian, who published the results of his experiments in his book Musikalische Graphik [3]. In 1926 he established the Musical Graphics Society and published the journal Archiv der Musikalische Graphik in Vienna. After he died in 1941, his work was continued by G. Zunderman and B. Ernst. In 1962, musical graphics was introduced into the curriculum of the Vienna Academy of Music and Fine Art, out of which developed the Musical Graphics Institute, where a special museum dedicated to the best works was established. The experience of the institute proves the effectiveness of drawing music in pedagogical and psychological research in- volving audio-visual associations (or concomitant audio and visual perceptions-a form of synesthesia). The methods of musical graphics have followers all over the world. In the Soviet Union, I began regular experiments in this field in the mid-1970s. The experiments pursued two types of objectives: scientific (studying the psychological regu- larities of color-hearing synesthesia) and pedagogical (testing the efficiency of the method in education). The scientific objec- tive necessitated investigating the way music is reflected in draw- ings-from distinct musical as- pects such as melody, harmony, mode, timbre, tempo, texture and dynamics to a more general impression of program music and non-program music in different styles and characters. The experiments were pre- ceded by questionnaires in which children were queried about the ABSTRACT This article describes ex- periments held in Kazan, Russia, in which children "draw" music. The results of the experiments are considered from educational and psychological points of view. Fig. 1. Musical graphics by 13-year-old schoolboy; music by R.

The student was asked to listen to the music without knowing the name of the piece. However, she was able to show the essence of this piano piece through both lines and colors. Fig. 3.

The questionnaires re- vealed that emotions served an interme- diary function in forming relationships in all these associations, including that of music-color. The music drawing itself was done by experimental and control groups of pu- pils. In the control group, traditional music classes, without drawing, were held. In the experimental group, the same musical works were studied but with the application of the method of musical graphics. The children had a preliminary acquaintance with the gen- eral aspects of music such as melody, harmony, tempo, etc. and aspects of painting such as drawing, coloring, com- position, etc. The children were asked to listen intently to a piece of music, then they participated actively in an analysis of its structure and content. Only after that did the children begin to draw. The groups consisted of schoolchil- dren in grades 1 to 10 in general educa- tion schools, music schools and art schools. The time spent listening to mu- sic was 15 minutes for the general edu- cation students and 60 minutes for the students in the special schools. Each stage of the experiment was accompa- nied by concrete tasks devised according to a principle of proceeding from the easy to the complicated. For instance, concerning form and content, the chil- dren were first asked to draw an easy-to- perceive short musical piece, then two one-part program music pieces that were more complex and, finally, two complex non-program compositions in two- or three-part form. A large-scale ex- periment was held to reveal timbre- color analogies by means of drawing music that was written for various solo instruments such as violin, flute, clavacin and trumpet, and for various types of orchestras (see Figs 1-4 and Color Plate A No. 3). One of the experiments included a ki- netic light-music film (a sort of ani- mated "musical graphics"), which ac- companied the music to be drawn. All the experiments have proven to have great pedagogical effectiveness: 1. Music drawing is a creative act that requires independent thinking and ac- tion and helps to create conditions for maximum concentration, to activate at- tention and interest, and to solve disci- pline problems in the classroom. 2. Psychologically, the fostering of in- dependent action in a play situation makes perception more sensitive and ef- fective. 3. A comparative analysis of the re- sults of question sessions, which were held after the experiments were per- formed and aimed to investigate the pu- pils' understanding of music content, revealed an essential rise in interest and understanding by students in the experi- mental groups as compared with the controls (especially in the experiment that involved showing the light-music film). 4. Long-term experiments provided a means of obtaining proof of a more thorough and sound knowledge of mu- sic in the experimental classes when fol- low-up studies were done 5 years later. 5. Children's drawings reflecting the form and content of musical works serve as visual documents that allow one to judge the depth of the music perception as well as the personal psychological 438 Vanechkina, "Musical Graphics"</page><page sequence="3">Fig. 4.

This provided feedback that was not available by any other means (such as testing, conversation or ques- tioning)-in every class and for every pupil. The children's drawings themselves, beyond their usefulness in an educa- tional setting, are of interest as indepen- dent works. For that reason they were exhibited at "Children Draw Music" ex- hibitions held during "Light and Music" All-Union Conferences in 1975 (Fig. 5), 1979 and 1986 and at the "Light and Music" festival of 1987 [4]. They have at- tracted the interest of specialists in the field of music psychology because of the way in which they realize dynamic music perception process compression in simultaneous integral patterns. The ex- periments have also confirmed our sci- entific assumptions about the regu- larities of color-hearing synesthesia. We have established hearing-visual corre- lations such as melody-drawing, tim- bre-color, register-lightness and to- nality-coloring. What are the relationships between the results of these experiments with drawing music and the other physical methods of visualizing music? They seem very similar to relationships be- tween psychology and musical acoustics and between audio perception processes and the physics of sound processes. The structure and hierarchy of these rela- tionships in synesthesia are the subject of complex research reported in a monograph by B.M. Galeyev [5] and several works of my own [6-9]. References 1.
