<plain_text><page sequence="1">From Apartheid to Liberation: Calvinism and the Shaping of Ethical Belief in South Africa SOCIOLOGICAL FOCUS Voi 24 No. 2 May 1991 Arguing against prevailing social-scientific analyses which trace the sources and nature of ethical beliefs in South Africa purely to material, economic and/or political factors, this essay asserts the comparable significance of religious belief in shaping South African morals. By means of an outline of Afrikaner history and a comparison of Dutch Calvinism in its various contemporary forms (white and black, pro- and anti-apartheid), the essay explores the applicability and effectiveness of a Weberian approach to the understanding of a society's ethical convictions. ... the strong secular bias of the West has made it virtually impossible for it to understand the values of any modern society which is resolutely religious. ? Roy Enquist (de Gruchy 1986, p. 23) .Lr espite the fact that over eighty percent of the South African population is self avowedly Christian, despite the fact that South Africa is a nation whose very Constitution defers to "the Sovereignty and Providence of [the Christian] God in guiding the affairs of nations/' social-scientific analyses of the origins and nature of apartheid have tended to ignore or minimize the role played by Christian theology. Marxian studies, tracing the roots of South African racial policy to the society's underlying material structures, are common (see, for example, W?lpe 1988, Fatton 1986, and Lodge 1983). Liberal analyses, reflecting the Western academic's increasingly secularized worldview and centering variously on economic, racial and/or political factors, abound (e.g., Report of the International Peace Academy 1987; Goldin 1987; Report of the Study Commission on United States Policy Toward Southern Africa 1981). Almost completely missing from such social-scientific analysis is one crucial ingredient: the role of religious belief and practice. The loss is an unfortunate one, not merely because Christianity and, in particular, Dutch Calvinism have been a part of South Africa since the time of the first permanent European settlement there in 1652; not merely because Dutch Calvinism has proven fascinatingly adept at sustaining the allegiance of not only the vast majority of 129</page><page sequence="2">130 SOCIOLOGICAL FOCUS Afrikaners but large numbers of blacks1; but also because Dutch Calvinism (and the Reformed theology it espouses) has played a pivotal role in the development of South African ethics, including its racial attitudes. This is a controversial but critical claim. For much modern sociological inquiry, religion's role in shaping the nature and values of society is (at best) secondary to other factors. Following in the tradition of Feuerbach, the task of the modern analyst of society has become, in Marx's words, to "resolve the religious world into its secular basis" (1958, p. 70). For Marx and his followers, of course, this means grounding the societal superstructure ? ideology, the state, law, and religion ? in the underlying material modes of production. For non-Marxian liberal analysts, it means accounting for the shape of religious belief via a combination of politics, economics and other constituents of secular life. Together these social-scientific approaches have exerted a profound influence upon sociological inquiry into the nature and origins of ethical belief. If Marx is correct when he writes "the ruling ideas [in every epoch] are nothing more than the ideal expression of the dominant material relationships," then the analysis of ethics itself becomes an ancillary (and relatively uninteresting) reflection of other aspects of sociological analysis (O'Toole 1984, p. 67). As McLellan writes, to such theorists, ethics "can be dismissed not in metaphysical, but in functional terms" (1987, p. 2). Ethics becomes an ideological image of that which is essential and prior, the instrument of secular needs and realities. The current social-scientific literature on South Africa is an enlightening and disturbing case in point. With few exceptions, the bases of Afrikaner and black ethical beliefs are alike found to rest purely in material foundations, and the role of religion in shaping these ethical attitudes is dismissed altogether. Thus, according to Fatton (1986, p. 50), the Afrikaner program of "apartheid is an oppressive system of labor exploitation determined by a particular pattern of class domination. ..." For Lodge and Goldin, the rise of black opposition to Afrikaner rule is traceable to South African economic policy: to "the cost of food, the price of transport, the shortage of shelter and the lack of money" (Lodge 1983, p. viii). For W?lpe (1988, p. 2), "race, class and the capitalist economy contingently combine" to create and uphold the system of white domination in South Africa. In such studies, the material desire for political power and economic wealth constitutes, for all practical purposes, the "explanation" of South African ethical belief; in none of these works is Dutch Calvinism even mentioned. (Indeed, Patton's is the only study to discuss Christianity at any length, and that is to assert: "Christianity must start reflecting on the anthropomorphic dimensions of the Marxist legacy, its major sociological insights, and the hope inherent in its revolutionary spirit. To do otherwise is to condemn the Church to irrelevancy" [1986, p. 114] ). Given Enquist's remarks concerning the "secular bias" of much Western scholar ship, perhaps one should not be surprised to find economic, political and racial factors cited in lieu of theological beliefs as crucial ingredients in the development of South African ethical attitudes. Neither should one be surprised to find that the treatments prescribed by Westerners to cure South Africa's ills are almost invariably economic, political ? supremely secular ? in nature: trade sanctions, divestiture, land and resource redistribution, changes in election laws.2 The treatment reflects the diagnosis. But the question that must be asked is: Is the diagnosis accurate? Do such accounts provide</page><page sequence="3">FROM APARTHEID TO LIBERATION 131 a reliable picture of the nature and origin of South African ethical beliefs? This essay will argue that the answer is no. Weber's plaint that "the modern man is in general, even with the best will, unable to give religious ideas a significance for culture and national character which they deserve" has only grown more compelling in the ninety years since it was written (1958, p. 183). As Robertson laments, much recent sociology, even the sociology of religion, "has tended to ignore the cognitive side of religion" (de Gruchy 1982, p. 23). In the South African context, a failure to appreciate the sociological significance of religious belief becomes particularly impairing; for it is the argument of this essay that Dutch Calvinism not only has provided and continues to provide the moral grounding for Afrikaner beliefs and policies, but it also provides the moral basis for leading black and white challenges to apartheid within South African and offers this troubled society perhaps its most viable hope for peaceful change. Parsons writes of Weber's The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism: ". . . his focus was not upon religion as such, as the theologian or church historian conceives it, but upon the relations between religious ideas and commitments and other aspects of human conduct" (Weber 1958, p. 131). This essay constitutes an exploration of these relations. With Weber, the author holds that the religious ideas and commit ments of a people play not an ancillary but a primary role in defining human conduct. This is not to claim that economic and material factors are unimportant (nor that prescrip tions based upon such factors must be ineffectual). As Weber writes (1958, p. 183): .... it is, of course, not my aim to substitute for a one-sided materialistic an equally one-sided spiritualistic causal interpretation of culture and of history. Each is equally possible, but each if it does not serve as the preparation, but as the conclusion of an investigation, accomplishes little in the interest of historical truth. This essay is a modest attempt to restore the balance between "material and spiritual interpretations" and thus to regain an approximation of historical truth in the under standing of social reality in South Africa. Toward this end, the discussion which follows will offer: (1) first, a brief historical outline in which the author will examine the role of Dutch Calvinism in the emergence of Afrikaner ethical belief; (2) second, an analysis of the resonance of history and theology in shaping the ethical present by means of an investigation on the contemporary mainstream Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (the Church of most Afrikaners and hence of most members of the South African government, its police force and military); and (3) finally, a discussion of the centrality of religious belief to social change as evidence in the writings and ideas of the Calvinist critique of apartheid within South Africa, including black Reformed churches (e.g., the Mission Church, the Alliance of Black Reformed Christians in South Africa), as well as Uberai white Reform Calvinists, both within and without the Dutch Reformed Church. In an examination of these various groups, the profound resiUency and hold of Calvinism upon the people of South Africa will be iUustrated. The "people of God," "Exodus," the "Covenant," the "sovereignty of God": the language and symbols employed by the Dutch Reformed Church to assert the privileged status of the Afrikaner race, are significantly, not scrapped by progressive Calvinists. Long embedded in the</page><page sequence="4">132 SOCIOLOGICAL FOCUS psyche of South Africans, white and black alike these very symbols are re-invented and, quite literally, re-4'christened" in the hands of black and liberal-white Calviniste. Two distinct and contradictory visions of South Africa's central religious symbols thus compete for the allegiance of contemporary South Africans. If Bellah (1975) is correct that American civil religion has become an "empty and broken shell," that American's once "common set of religious and moral understandings" (understandings centered, ironically enough, upon many of the same biblical symbols at play in South Africa) have disintegrated and can only be restored by a "rebirth of imaginative vision" and a collective reaffirmation of "our ancient faith," then the struggle of contemporary South Africans for religious and moral consonance should be of particular significance. Bellah's prescription for America's future is being tested in present-day South Africa; black and liberal white South African Calviniste are already engaged in a complex and sophisticated effort to revitalize the symbols of Calvinism and hence unite a divided people. Piet Meyer may have been correct in 1940 when he wrote: "The Afrikaner People [not the Swiss, Dutch or Americans] are in truth the only people who have been born and have developed out of a Calvinist way of life" (Hexham 1981, p. 2). But today the Afrikaner may be joined in this distinction by millions of black South Africans ? true and committed Calviniste. In this fact may rest South Africa's greatest ethical irony and her greatest social resource. DUTCH CALVINISM AND THE HISTORICAL EMERGENCE OF AFRIKANER ETHICAL BELIEF Who can imagine how the morning sun, symbol of truth and happiness, was greeted today in the refugee camps of South Africa? O Sunshine, they have longed for you in the calm of a sleepless night, and yet they feared for you, the 100,000 old men, women and children, crowded in cold, shivering, damp and dark tents. . . . Holy justice has been violated, because might is above right, because of the violence done to children. These words could well have been spoken in 1991 about the treatment of blacks at the hands of Afrikaners. They were in fact spoken in 1901 by F. C. Fleisher, a Mennonite minister in Holland, about the treatment of Afrikaners at the hands of the British (de Gruchy 1979, p. 25). To appreciate the significance of religious belief in shaping Afrikaner ethical con victions, one must appreciate the complexity of Afrikaner history. At the heart of this complexity is the historical role the Afrikaner has played not merely as oppressor but as oppressed and the historical tensions which exist in South Africa not simply between black and white but between white and white, British and Afrikaner. From the earliest days of the Dutch East India Company's settlement of the Cape, the events of South African history were seen through the eyes of Dutch Calvinism. The conviction of Jan van Riebeeck, the expedition's leader, that God was guiding,</page><page sequence="5">FROM APARTHEID TO LIBERATION 133 directing and preserving the mission ("[We] had grave fears of capsizing. . . . Hardly an hour after we had tacked about, the Lord God made the rough weather subside and gave us a favorable wind" [Templin 1984, p. 16] )3 grew, by the 1700s, to a belief that the Dutch settlers, the Afrikaners, were literally following in the footsteps of the ancient Israelites. Near Cape Town, they found the valley Jehosaphat and a hill was named the Tower of Babel (Templin 1984, p. 33); upon discovering some stone cairns along the Fish River in the 1770s, an Afrikaner expedition believed them to be monuments left behind by the Ancient Israelites (Neuhaus 1986, p. 26). This deeply providential and biblical religious world view, certainly not unique to South Africa at the time, combined with the extraordinary historical events of the nine teenth century to lay down the foundations for Afrikaner ethical belief. In 1806, the British occupied the Cape. Interested variously in the strategic signi ficance of the location, the wealth of the land, and the souls of the indigenous peoples, this diverse group of administrators, military personnel, pioneers and missionaries ? with the power of Great Britain behind them ? immediately gained dominance over the nonaligned Afrikaners. (The Dutch East Indian settlement had, from the first, been politically independent from Holland.) In 1811, the British administration set up a court system. In 1813, English was established as the official language of civil servants. In 1822, a "free English state" school system was initiated, and the exclusive use of the English language in the courts was proclaimed. "By the late 1820s," writes de Gruchy (1979, p. 18), "many Afrikaners along the eastern Cape frontier had grown disenchanted with the British administra tion." The Afrikaner resentment was exacerbated by "Ordinance Fifty" which in 1828 established legal equality for all free persons in South Africa, regardless of race or color. In 1833, slavery was abolished by the British. A line had been crossed. Over the next four years, from 1835-1838, tens of thousands of Afrikaners (many of whom were farmers of Dutch descent, i.e., "Boers" ) fled British rule by foot and by wagon in a "Great Trek," an exodus, to the uncharted regions northeast of the Cape, many settling in the Vaal River Valley (the Transvaal). In this pivotal event, one sees the coming together and complex interplay of a host of factors in defining Afrikaner action and belief. Economic and racial issues were obviously present; many Afrikaners had a great deal to lose financially by the abolition of slavery. (In fact, only Afrikaners had much to lose by the proclamation; few British South Africans owned slaves.) But these considerations were tied inextricably to political factors, such as the resentment felt toward the governing British by Dutch settlers who, by historical self-selection, were a fiercely independent lot. One can credibly wonder, for example, if the Afrikaner defense of slavery in the face of British opposition was not as much a matter of cultural chauvinism as economics. These political and economic factors were joined, simultaneously and integrally, by a religious component. Even before the Trek, tensions between the Church of England and the Dutch Reformed Church had been high. Afrikaners began to perceive their suffering as an instance of not merely economic and political subjugation but religious subjugation, as well. As early as 1812, at leat one Afrikaner wrote of British restric tions as an "oppression led by Pharaoh." This metaphor was then developed and employed to dramatic effect in the 1830s by the Boer general and spokesman Andries</page><page sequence="6">134 SOCIOLOGICAL FOCUS Pretorious, himself portrayed as the "new Joshua" as he led troops into battle (Templin 1984, pp. 99, 87, 110). What was avowedly at stake was not merely wealth and pride, but theological principle. One of the members of the Great Trek, Anna Steenkamp, explains: "... it is not [the slaves'] freedom that drove us to such lengths, as their being placed on an equal footing with Christians, contrary to the laws of God and the natural distinction of race and religion, so that it was intolerable for any decent Christian to bow beneath such a yoke; wherefore we withdrew in order to preserve our doctrines in purity" (de Gruchy 1979, p. 18). Perhaps "doctrinal" factors were not, as Steenkamp asserts, prior to economic and political considerations in shaping Afrikaner action and belief here. But it would be folly to dismiss religious convictions as insignificant in forging the emerging Afrikaner ethical perspective. Indeed, the step from Steenkamp's comments to modern Afrikaner ethical beliefs concerning apartheid is, as will become evident, a small one. Two other nineteenth-century events, the Vow of Covenant at Blood River (1838) and the Anglo-Boer War (1899-1902), facilitate the tracing of this step. While trekking north from the Cape in 1838, a party of five hundred Boers was surrounded by fifteen thousand Zulu warriors. On Sunday, December 7, the Boers gathered in prayer. Sarei Celliers records in his Journal in 1838: "I saw, to the extent of the light granted me, that we must become suppliants of the Lord to entreat that He would be with us at our standards, as he was with Moses and Joshua." A communal vow was taken. Celliers records: My brethren and fellow countrymen, at this moment we stand before the holy God of heaven and earth, to make a promise, if he be with us and protect us so that we may triumph ... that we shall observe the day of the date as an anniversary in each year, and a day of thanksgiving like the Sabbath, in His honor; and we will build a temple in His honor where we may worship Him; and that we shall enjoin our children that they may take part with us in this, for a remembrance for our posterity (Templin 1984, p. 111). On December 16, the Zulu forces attacked. That evening, when they had retreated, the Zulus left behind three thousand of their own dead and the river flowing with blood. According to Celliers, the Boers suffered but three casualties. The Covenant had been established. Here was an event that, in Afrikaner eyes, simultaneously confirmed God's favor upon the Afrikaner people and embodied the Calvinist vision of God as sovereign over history. Paul Kruger, the Transvaal leader in the 1880s and 1890s, declared of Blood River: "Unbelievers say God does not do signs and wonders as in the days of the old Covenant, but I can show you from our own history that the dear Lord does everything to give a good time to those that are people of the Lord" (Templin 1984, p. 212). Kruger went on to cite God's words to Abraham in Genesis (17:7): "The covenant which I made with you and your descendente, excluding none, shall remain before you and your seed from now until eternity." The Afrikaner Covenant would be tested mightily in the years ahead. In the 1870s and 1880s, gold and diamonds were discovered in the Transvaal, and Great Britain initiated efforts to annex this newly established Afrikaner republics. The resulting con frontation, the Anglo-Boer War, lasted three years and left a permanent scar on the</page><page sequence="7">FROM APARTHEID TO LIBERATION 135 Afrikaner people. The British army crushed the elusive but under-armed and under manned Boer forces. As illustrated by the words of F. C. Fleisher's sermon cited earlier, the human toll for the Afrikaners went far beyond defeat on the battlefield; "one-hundred thousand old men, women and children [were] crowded in cold, damp and dark tents" by the British, the first time civilian concentration camps had been usedin modern warfare. By the end of the three-year conflict, twenty-seven thousand Afrikaner civilians ? men, women and children ? had perished in the camps. The Boer War, like the Great Trek, was undeniably an event with economic and political impetuses. But for the Afrikaner, the religious motive was just as concrete. The French Colonel Villebois-Mareuil observed during the war: "An atmosphere of deep religious feeling pervades the [Afrikaner] camp, which commits everything to God-If you compliment a general, he says, 'God has permitted it' " (Templin 1984, p. 257). As tensions with the British escalated, C. P. Bezuidenhout wrote: "What the [Jebusites and Amorites] were for the vine stalk of Caanan, that is what the British government is for the people of God brought over seas to a distant land" (Templin 1984, p. 206). Bezuidenhout's words were neither intended nor received as metaphor. The Afrikaners did indeed believe they were the "people of God" and England "Pharaoh," even in defeat. In addressing his people in the face of conquest, Kruger declared: "O God of the Volksraad and of the Republics, shall this be our final act? No it shall not be, it cannot be." Why not? Kruger responded: "Brothers, is it not the same God who cleft the Red Sea asunder and punished Pharaoh with his hosts when Moses remained firmly trustful" (Templin 1984, p. 257). Afrikaners could make sense of defeat, and hold fast to the ethical principles on which the war was fought, in confidence that God does not forsake His people. When Afrikaner politicians arose to power in the twentieth century ? an ascent initiated in the elections of the 1907-08 and culminating the (Afrikaner) Nationalist Party victory under D. F. Malan in 1948 ? the promise had been fulfilled. In Afrikaner eyes, a chosen people had returned to God. ETHICS AND THE CONTEMPORARY DUTCH REFORMED CHURCH IN SOUTH AFRICA By means of even this brief and episodic encounter with white South African history, the ethical position of the modern Afrikaner becomes both more ironic and more decipherable. The irony rests in the fact that a people who sees its own history as one of oppression has now become the seemingly obdurate oppressor. The decipherability comes via a set of clues as to how this contradiction, so glaring to the outsider, can be disavowed by the Afrikaner. How can the Afrikaner claim to be both Christian and supporter of the apartheid system? What informs and sustains Afrikaner ethical belief? As Afrikaner history reveals, an answer can be traced, in part, to the beliefs and symbols of Calvinist theology. In his Institutes of the Christian Religion, John Calvin develops the concept of the "sovereignty of God." "Anyone who has been taught by Christ's hps that all of the hairs on his head are numbered will look farther afield for a cause, and will consider</page><page sequence="8">136 SOCIOLOGICAL FOCUS that all events are governed by God's secret plan," he writes (I, xvi, 2). Calvin's God is not merely the omnipredicate God of the "mainstream" Judeo-Christian tradi tion ? a God with the potential to control all; He is also a God who, through his "secret plan," has decided to make use of that potential. The result is a world divinely shaped and controlled to the last detail: "... while the disturbances of the world deprive us of judgment, God out of the pure light of his justice and wisdom tempers these very movements in the best conceived order to a right end," according to Calvin (I, xvii, 1). Despite the fact that human frailty may deny us knowledge of God's will, we can witness his plan in the predestined "best conceived order" that is the world around us. It is this specifically Calvinistic rendering of the sovereignty of God which fashioned Jan van Riebeeck's confidence in God's advocacy of the Cape project; which placed God's guiding hand behind the Great Trek and the victory at Blood River; and which initiated a period of moral introspection upon Afrikaner defeat in the Anglo-Boer War.4 And it is this specifically Calvinistic rendering of the sovereignty of God which is at the source of many of the ethical currents in South African society today. It is not surprising that, in a nation whose very Constitution defers to "Sovereignty and Providence of God in guiding the affairs of nations" (Bloomberg 1989, p. xxiii), the political status quo has come to take on divine dimensions. As H. G. Stoker writes: "God willed the diversity of Peoples. Thus far he has preserved the identity of our [the Afrikaner] people. Such preservation was not for naught, for God allows nothing to happen for naught" (de Gruchy 1979, p. 31). If the Afrikaner people exist, they exist by God's will. If the Afrikaner people exist despite great historical odds, their preservation must be an indication of their privileged status in God's eyes. A ship is guided through storm-tossed seas in 1652, five-hundred Afrikaners defeat fifteen thousand Zulus in 1838, Afrikaners gain political victory against the might of the British Empire in 1948: there is a deep significance in these events. As M alan claims: "The history of the Afrikaner reveals a determination and a defini teness of purpose which make one feel that Afrikanerdom is not the work of man but the creation of God. We have a Divine right to be Afrikaners. Our history is the highest work of art of the Architect of the centuries" (Patterson 1957, p. 3). This vision of God's sovereignty is not necessarily applied consistently by the Afrikaner (nor, perhaps, can it be). When, in the late nineteenth century, the Afrikaner Thomas Francis Burgers argued, "we cannot go to war against the British to gain our freedom" because to do so is to challenge God's perfect order, he was vilified by the people (Templin 1984, p. 161).5 But whether consistently applied or not, the Calvinist concept of God's sovereignty over his chosen people has a profound hold on the contemporary Afrikaner. The remem brance of Blood River, now known as "Covenant Day," is the center of the Afrikaner calendar ? "Christmas, Easter and your Fourth of July rolled all into one," as one South African journalist puts it (Neuhaus 1986, p. 16). The moral significance of that day, and the covenant that was established, remains compelling. Neuhaus (1986, p. 17) observes: Historical myths are contingent. That is, they can be falsified or vindicated by future events. The vow of December 7 was, in Afrikaner eyes, vindicated by the victory of December 16. If or when the crunch comes in the years ahead and South Africa must really stand alone, then, many Afrikaners assert with feeling, they will once again stake their all on the covenant.</page><page sequence="9">FROM APARTHEID TO LIBERATION 137 God will not forget His promise or forsake His people. As in previous centuries, con temporary Afrikaner ethical belief depends on it. These reoccurring symbols ? the sovereignty of God, the people of God and the Covenant ? combine with one other religious concept to validate apartheid in the eyes of many present-day Afrikaners: the Word of God. As De Cruchy writes: "In true Reformed Church style, the Word of God is the norm by which we test our opinions and actions" (1979, p. 71). The assertion that the Word of God "contains guiding principles for all spheres of life" is a common refrain in official documents of the Dutch Reformed Church. And it is through the "Word of God" that Stoker's claim, "God wills the diversity of Peoples," is given a biblical basis. Certain passages from the Pentateuch prove pivotal. In Genesis 10, Noah's sons, Shem, Ham and Japheth, each becomes the progenitor of a new nation in the aftermath of the Flood. In the foDowing chapter, the peoples of all nations are chastised for uniting and attempting to usurp God's power by erecting the Tower of Babel. God responds: "Come let us go down and confuse their language, so that they may not understand one another's speech. So the Lord scattered them abroad over the face of the earth" (Genesis 11:7-8). Deuteronomy 32:8 explains: "the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance when he separated the sons of man." These passages unite with by-now-familiar Calvinistic concepts, particularly the sovereignty of God, to create powerful ethical implications. The Dutch Reformed Church itself declares "ethnic diversity is in its very origin in accordance with the will of God for this dispensation" (de Gruchy 1979, p. 71) and, recognizes "the existence of races and nations as separate units foreordained by God" (Giliomee and Schlemmer 1989, p. 47).6 The issue is a simple one according to Nico Diederichs, former President of South Africa: "God willed that there should be nations_He willed the existence in the human sphere of a variety of nations, cultures and languages" (Bloomberg 1989, p. 13). The Dutch Calvinist Abraham Kuyper confirms: "God almighty intervened in human life to cause this division. Both the idea and its realisation came from Him" (Bloomberg 1989, p. 16). To challenge these divisions is to challenge God. Such arguments are not merely a twentieth-century phenomena. As previously observed, these words were on the hps of Anna Steenkamp as she justified her participa tion in the Great Trek in 1838. They remain on the lips of Afrikaners today. If one is to understand the sociological dynamics of racial attitudes in South Africa, one must begin to listen to these words. Their sincerity cannot be judged merely by the prevailing Western perspective. As Neuhaus (1986, p. 17) writes, "The modern [Western] mind pretends impatience with such myths." Yet to dismiss the words of Afrikaners as empty, to see religious justifica tions of apartheid as merely a veil covering the true economic and political motivations, is to fail to see a people who have been shaped by a religious history and who remain tied to a religious world view. As C. W. H. Boshoff, former chairman of the radically pro-Afrikaner/pro-apartheid group the Broderbond,7 explains: Afrikaner racial policy "certainly is not a matter of pragmatism. Pragmatism is not an Afrikaans word. . . . We lived by principle based on scriptual truth" (Neuhaus 1986, p. 43). Even if only partly true, this insight nonetheless presents both new challenges and</page><page sequence="10">138 SOCIOLOGICAL FOCUS new resources to those who seek to peacefully resolve the conflict in South Africa. On the one hand, if the motivation behind apartheid is not simply wealth and power but also principle, the imposition of economic and political sanctions can be of only limited value. Indeed, while the world community's isolation of South Africa is a political and economic liability to South Africans, it simultaneously has become a source of religious resolve. As the South African President declared in 1981: "The total onslaught against South Africa is a total onslaught against the Kingdom of God" (cf. Boesak 1984, p. 98). South African isolation by the United Nations, for example, becomes a badge of honor for a people who believe steadfastly that God has willed the diversity of peoples; Afrikaners have merely dissociated themselves from an organization that has "take[n] the first steps toward restoring pre-Babelist unity and re-enacting sinful rebellion against God" (Bloomberg 1989, p. 17). On the other hand, the fact that Afrikaners and their ethical attitudes are profoundly shaped by Calvinist belief establishes common ground between Afrikaners and large segments of their moral opposition, black and white alike, within South Africa. It is to arguments of this group, the liberal Calvinist opposition to apartheid within South Africa, that this essay now turns. THE CALVINIST CRITIQUE OF APARTHEID WITHIN SOUTH AFRICA Allan Boesak (1984, p. 83), perhaps the leading black Calvinist in South Africa today, writes: "When [the Afrikaner] introduced slavery and enforced it with the most vicious forms of dehumanization and violence, it was the Bible read through Reformed eyes and arguments from the Reformed tradition that gave them justification for acts of violence and human tragedy. The God of the Reformed tradition was the God of slavery, fear, persecution and death." As argued above, this is still the God of many South Africans. Given this fact ? and given the Dutch Reformed Church's history of justifying apartheid ? one might suspect that Calvinist theology would be widely rejected by the proponents of racial reform in South Africa. As is so often the case when examining South Africa, one's initial suspicions are mistaken. The Black Calvinist church in South Africa has a history that dates back over a century. Instituted by Afrikaner Calviniste as a "mission" to the black population in the 1800s, many of these churches have only recently begun to separate themselves from the ethical beliefs of the Dutch Reformed Church. The synod of the (black) Mission Church, for instance, only renounced apartheid as "irreconcilable with the Gospel" in 1978. What is fascinating about the people who populate these churches ? and cricial to the project of this essay ? is not merely their ethical opposition to apartheid, but the foundation on which they erect this opposition: Dutch Calvinism itself. When, for example, the members of the Alliance of Black Reformed Churches in South Africa (ABRECSA) "unequivocally declare[d] that apartheid is a sin,... a travesty of the Gospel [and] a betrayal of the Reformed tradition" in 1983, they also committed themselves "to come to a truer understanding of the Reformed tradition and [to] accept the challenge to articulate our faith in terms which are authentic and relevant" (J?bber 1985, p. 283 and De Gruchy 1986, p. 37). For millions of the opponents of apartheid,</page><page sequence="11">FROM APARTHEID TO LIBERATION 139 Dutch Calvinism is not to be dismissed or dismantled but restored. Central to the efforts of groups like ABRECSA and the Mission Church and individuals like Boesak is an attempt to re-christen ? to dedicate to Christ once again ? the language, symbols and beliefs of Reformed theology. The student of these efforts encounters talk of the "suffering and oppression of God's people." She hears the name of Moses invoked, and the Exodus remembered: This name, this name of Jesus, what name is it? ... It is the same name Moses heard . .. the God of the exodus ... the God who told us, "I am there for my people, I have heard their cry and I have seen their suffering, how they are bent low under the whip, under the yoke of slavery in Egypt. Now, however, these are not the words of Afrikaners as they flee the British Pharoah. They are the words of Allan Boesak (1984, p. 33). The "people of God" have become black South Africans, and Afrikaners have become the "rulers who consistently disobey God's laws, who persist in oppression and violence." The Calvinistic rendering of the sovereignty of God, too, reemerges here as the basis for moral belief and action. "We believe passionately with Abraham Kuyper that there is not a single inch of life that does not fall under the Lordship of Christ," Boesak writes (De Gruchy 1982, p. 36). Indeed, the sovereignty of God over all the world, including the government of South Africa, is the font of Boesak's hope: "If the rulers will not hear the cries of the people, if they will not change, if they continue to prevent justice, let us pray them out of existence. God will hear our cry" (Boesak and Villa-Vicencio 1986, p. 16). According to the South African Council of Churches: God "removes from power those who persist in defying his laws" (Boesak and Villa-Vicencio 1986, p. 17). For the black Calvinist in South Africa, the power of the symbol of God leading his people from bondage is no less real than for the Afrikaner. But to the black, it is a future promise rather than a past reality. "Israel has experienced Yahweh's power in his sensitivity to their cries of pain and suffering and in the ten plagues; in the exodus and in the closing of the waters of the Red Sea.... This God will rise up; this God will deliver us from the hands of those evil men who think and do violence to God's defenceless people" (Boesak and Villa-Vicencio 1986, pp. 152, 35). The covenant, too, is awaited by black South Africans. "A new covenant," writes E. Sikakane, "... is our great need in Africa." This is to be a "covenant of reconcila tion" ratified as "both Zulus and Afrikaners appear before God at Blood River." According to Sikakane (1978, pp. 307-308), the Day of the Covenant, currently a reaffirm ation of the estrangement between black and white, will be transformed into a day of unity for all South Africans. One might justifiably question the practical implications of this black revitaliza tion of the symbols of Dutch Calvinism. Like the original mission churches to the blacks, does not this movement buttress the political interest of the Afrikaners by encourag ing black passivity in the face of oppersssion? The people are promised "God will rise up ... God will deliver us." In the process, are not blacks encouraged to simply wait? Such fears are unfounded. This essay has already shown that these same promises, in the hands of the Dutch Reformed Church, did not lead to Afrikaner passivity in the face of British oppression. Additionally, most black Christians in South Africa see a very clear moral obligation accruing in these religious symbols; the symbols are em</page><page sequence="12">140 SOCIOLOGICAL FOCUS powering rather than debilitating. To the black person who waits idly for change, Buthelezi declares, "God will say: 'Was Christ's resurrection not sufficient to liberate you, black man, from [that] kind of spiritual and psychological death? Go to eternal damnation, black man, for you did not muster courage to save your wife or brother" (Neuhaus 1986, p. 119). Boesak writes: "We can no longer take this suffering, we can no longer watch our children die; we will rise up" (Boesak and Villa-Vicencio 1986, p. 8, emphasis added). Passivity is rarely evidenced. Instead, symbols such as redemptive suffering, the people of God, the Covenant, and the Exodus ? symbols, ironically, planted in the religious psyche of blacks by the Afrikaners themselves ? are being reinfused with liberating potential by black Calviniste. And yet, the significance of this reinterpretation of Calvinism rests not merely in its power to liberate blacks but also in its transformative power over whites. The com pelling nature of the black appropriation of the symbols of Dutch Calvinism is difficult for even the Afrikaner opposition to deny. In an immensely ironic sermon (one fears unintentionally so), the Dutch Reformed Rev. P. J. Viljoen argued to his congregation that Afrikaners should not wish to remove the black person from South Africa: "He is the greatest asset to the country. . . . Take him away and out national life will be disrupted like ... that of the Egyptians ... and we will send battalions to bring them back" (Kinghorn 1984, p. 9). At such moments, the Afrikaner has become Pharoah even in his own eyes. Indeed, there has emerged from within the Dutch Reformed Church a whole move ment of Afrikaners who are critically evaluating the Reformed tradition's theological grounding of apartheid. Influenced by Wilhelm Niesel's criticism of attempts to elevate Aryanism and the German Reich to God-sanctioned sovereignty in the 1930s and 40s (a very real danger given the Calvinistic rendering of the sovereignty of God), white Dutch Calviniste in South Africa, led by C. F. Beyers Naude and the Christian Institute, began to turn the same critical eyes upon themselves in the 1960s (de Gruchy 1986, p. 29-30). For these liberal white reformers, Calvin remains a revered figure, but God's approval of Afrikaner rule ie queetioned. Familiar passages are reinterpreted. When Calvin writes in the Institutes that "the powers of magistrates are from God, not as pestilence... but because he has appointed them for the just and lawful government of the world," the Afrikaner emphasis previously had been upon God's legitimization of state powere; now the emphasie is shifted to God's expressed reason for the appointment: "the just and lawful government of the world. " If a government falls ehort of this mandate, it, not thoee who oppoee it, ie in defiance of God'e will (Boeeak and Villa-Vicencio 1986, pp. 139 &amp; 149). New paaeagea are emphasized. Villa-Vicencio seee Calvin'e worde ae decisive: "The Lord ... is the King of Kings, who, when he has opened his sacred mouth, must alone be heard. ... If they [civil authorities] command anything against him, let it go unesteemed" (Boesak and Villa-Vicencio 1986, p. 21). For such interpreters of the Reformed tradition, Calvin's role as "reformer" is taken seriously. As de Gruchy writes, Calvinism becomes an "ideology of transition" and "the true heirs of Calvin [become]. . . not necessarily those who systematize his thought, but those whose intention, motivation, and application are the same as his" (de Gruchy</page><page sequence="13">FROM APARTHEID TO LIBERATION 141 1982, pp. 37, 32). De Gruchy also suggests that Calvinist opponents of apartheid without South Africa should look to an aspect of Reformed thought long dormant in the South African context: the concept of the millenarian movement. Based on the apocalyptic transfor mations promised and described in the book of Revelation, millenarian movements look forward to a radical restructuring of the categories of power, wealth and prestige in a society. Significantly for the project of this paper, according to de Gruchy (1982, p. 35), millenarian movements enact this transformation by reappropriating traditional language and symbols and reconstructing "the symbolic universe" of the society in ques tion. As Wayne Meeks writes: [T]he developed myth or ideology invariably combin?is] the traditional with the radically new. To many anthropologists this has been the most fascinating aspect of millenarian movements, for it affords a means by which a strongly tradition-oriented culture or subculture can radically transform its world-view and ethos in the face of a new situation without losing a sense of continuity with the past (de Gruchy 1982, p. 35). Meeks' words, though not addressed to the South African context, cogently describe the importance of the Calvinist critique of apartheid within South Africa. Here one finds a movement which combines the traditional with the new; the theological symbols which guided and grounded the Afrikaner people are used to project and populate a radically new South African society. The ties to Calvinism are maintained even as the ties to apartheid are severed. If the argument in the first part of this essay is correct, if religion does indeed rest at the root of Afrikaner ethical belief, then this is precisely the course that must be followed if change is to be achieved in South Africa. South Africans will not share a less discordant moral vision until they share a less discordant theological vision. As Bellah (1975, p. ix) writes: ". . . any coherent and viable society rests upon a common set of moral understandings about good and bad, right and wrong, in the realm of individual and social action.. .. These rest in turn upon a common set of religious understandings ... that provide a picture of the universe in terms of which the moral understandings make sense." If South Africa is to become a "coherent and viable society," and if the social sciences are to contribute insightfully to the process, then the role of religion in shaping the sociological reality of South Africa can no longer be dismissed. CONCLUSION Franklin Sonn, a black South African, asks: "If ithe Afrikaner thinks of himself as a very moral man, is it bad or good?" If the argument of this essay is correct, it is both. As Sonn observes: "It means he can do evil with his whole heart, but it also means he is vulnerable to being questioned on a moral level" (Neuhaus 1986, p. 38). Historically, Calvinism has been the source of profound division and injustice in South Africa. Ironically, in the future Calvinism may be South Africa's richest resource for change and its greatest hope for peace.</page><page sequence="14">142 SOCIOLOGICAL FOCUS FOOTNOTES 1. The Christian population in South Africa is 88% Black and 12% white. In 1980, 90% of all Afrikaners were members of one of the three white Dutch Calvinist Churches in South Africa: 1.7 million belonged to the Dutch Reformed Church, the Nederduitse Gereformeerde Kerk; .25 million to the Nederduitse Hervormde Kerk; and .125 to the Gereformeerde Kerk. Because of the close link between the history and doctrines of these Afrikaner churches, some scholars refer to the three collectively as the Dutch Reformed Church (see Bloomberg 1989, p. 48). 2. For example, in its section on steps to ending apartheid, the Report of the International Peace Academy (1987) devotes three chapters to "multilateral sanctions" but not so much as a paragraph to the potential role of the church. W?lpe (1988, p. 90) proposes "the dismantling of the giant corporations," "the removal of the extreme inequalities in the access to land," and "the massive redistribution of resources." 3. The trustees of the Dutch East India Company, in their pre-voyage charge to van Riebeeck, urge that he undertake the expedition "that God's holy name may be magnified, the Church of Christ be built up, and likewise the private honor and reputation of yourselves" (Templin 1984, p. 16). 4. In a testament to the interplay between religion and popular ethics in South Africa, Kruger adopted a theological theme in his Fourth Inaugural Address as President of the Transvaal in 1898 in order to explain the imminent defeat of his people at the hands of the British: "God is chastising us, and we shall find that everywhere we are breaking God's commandments_We often ask, 'Why does the Lord chastise us so?' Is it not in order that we may return to him?" (Templin 1984, p. 247). 5. More recently, another Afrikaner resisted efforts by farmers to curb the onslaught of locusts on the grounds that the "locusts were a plague, as in the days of King Pharoah, sent by God, and the country would assuredly be loaded with shame and obloguy if it tried to raise its hand against the mighty hand of the Almighty." The farmers were unmoved by the argument (Templin 1984, p. 226). 6. For a concise and insightful summary of the Dutch Reformed Church's support of apartheid, see Giliomee and Schlemmer 1989, pp. 46ff. 7. The "Broderbond" or "Brotherhood" is, of course, itself a term with deep Calvinistic importance (see Weber 1958, pp. 135-136). REFERENCES Bellah, Robert. 1968. "Civil Religion in America."
