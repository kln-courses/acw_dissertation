<plain_text><page sequence="1">COMMENTS AND CRITICISM THE ACCIDENTS OF PEIRCE 'S SYSTEM DROFESSOR WEISS contends in the preceding article that 1 Peirce's philosophical contributions acquire their essential sig- nificance when regarded as elements of a system. He believes that if the system is "dissected" or "dismembered" its constituent theories are in danger of assimilation and inevitable distortion by philosophic factions. This, of course, presupposes what has so often been contested, that all the theories are compatible. Pro- 63 The passages referred to in this essay often contain, not only references to other places where the points here made are reaffirmed or elucidated, but explicit comments on questions which have not been here discussed.

In this sense, the present paper can pretend to give only an outline of the essence of the system, and but the barest hint of its richness and variety.</page><page sequence="2">COMMENTS AND CRITICISM 265 fessor Weiss admits that quotations contradicting his own can be advanced, but belittles their importance. Probably he would not claim that he had established the validity of the systematic inter- pretation, but that he had begun what could be completed. Why Professor Weiss should dread abstraction from Peirce is not clear. Whatever cumulative growth there has been in the stream of classical philosophy has been achieved not by modifying a ready-made system, but by the partial or limited acceptance of a given philosopher 's work through discriminating selection, and this where the homogeneity of the previous system was far greater than in Peirce. Kant, for instance, could extend the philosophic horizon by abstracting from philosophers of widely opposite tend- ency, and we do not have to be told today of the possibility, in fact the advisability, of profiting from Kant while freeing ourselves from the outlines of his system. Only as thus assimilated can theories contribute to that progressive growth of co6perative phi- losophizing which Peirce so ardently desired. As for the evil of distorted interpretation, it is as likely to befall an entire system as a single theory. Professor Weiss's interest in preserving the dis- tinctive character of Peirce's philosophy, its esthetic quality as a unique historical whole, perhaps reflects a preference of his own for individualism in philosophic method. Peirce himself did intend a grand system. I am not here con- cerned with any exhibition of inconsistencies, though I can not re- frain from remarking that he who establishes the internal congruity of a philosophy of common sense with an anthropomorphic pan- psychism will prove himself very dexterous indeed. There is a much more serious consideration. It could be shown, by a suf- ficiently detailed analysis, how vicious are the consequences of interpreting Peirce's individual theories primarily in terms of their place in his total scheme; how, for example, we should misunder- stand the conception of fallibilism if we took seriously an assertion that it is closely tied up with metaphysical evolutionism. The reason is that the better of the theories were developed as answers to specific problems, and the results of such inquiries do not respect esthetic demands. Certainly any collection of opinions can be harmonized if we are willing to pay the price of obscurity. In Peirce the price is great, and it is doubtful that we can make the alternative claim of poetic value for the system. But it is with hesitation that one warns of obscurity, because philosophers ap- parently disagree more than ever on what is and is not obscure. Thus Professor Weiss considers James's appraisal of the Lectures on Pragmatism ("flashes of brilliant light relieved against Cim- merian darkness") a "strange description" of an "elementary"</page><page sequence="3">266 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY work, while to me it has always seemed that no description could be more accurate. In controverting the alleged "intimate connection" between the phenomenology, logic, and metaphysics of Peirce, I must appeal to the very unsubtle distinction between what Peirce says and what Peirce does. We can find him to say almost anything somewhere or other. He might, for example, tell us that pragmatism "cannot be understood" unless such-and-such a principle is presupposed. If, however, after examination it proved to be the case that in the great series of papers on pragmatism or on the logic of empirical science it was stated and was understandable without employing that principle, this would illustrate what I mean by distinguishing between his saying one thing and doing another; and his saying what he says could reasonably be explained as an obiter dictum designed to help unify his projected system. What do we find when we use this procedural criterion? (1) Peirce speaks of pragmatism in one breath with meta- physics and ethics, but any reader can confirm the fact that the actual formulation of pragmatism, as the principle of interpreta- tion that he intended it to be, is rooted in logic or general semiotic alone. Procedurally examined, it becomes clear that the various papers on pragmatism are elaborate attempts to define a certain sub-class of "logical interpretants" of a sign.' (Cf., e.g., 5.464- 496.) More than once Peirce says that pragmatism assumes the truth of synechism, the principle of continuity. Now, is not syn- echism one of the foundations of Peirce's metaphysics? No doubt but this does not mean that it must itself be a metaphysical asser- tion. And, in fact, when Peirce makes statements like those relat- ing it to pragmatism, he is thinking of it as a methodological principle, which is precisely what he defines it as in Baldwin's Dictionary: " Synechism is not an ultimate and absolute metaphysi- cal doctrine; it is a regulative principle of logic, prescribing what sort of hypothesis is fit to be entertained and examined" (6.173). My purpose is not to match quotations with Professor Weiss, but I must call attention to the numerous occasions on which Peirce protests that his pragmatism is "no doctrine of metaphysics" but a "logical rule" (cf. 5.18, 423, 464-5, 469; 4.534; 6.482, 490, etc.). (2) Peirce does say, as Professor Weiss points out, that the sciences must turn to metaphysics for certain of their assumptions, but he never says that they must turn to any but the scientific method; on the contrary, he is unwaveringly insistent that "Phi- losophy ought to imitate the successful sciences in its methods" ' See my Charles Peirce's Empiricism, ?? 29-34, 40.</page><page sequence="4">COMMENTS AND CRITICISM 267 (5.265). Pragmatism was intended to be the logical instrument enabling it to do this. After its divorce of the genuinely proble- matic from the pseudo-problematic, "what will remain of philoso- phy will be a series of problems capable of investigation by the observational methods of the true sciences" (5.423). Moreover, pragmatism is based on a study of science, and is not a methodo- logical legislator to science. The pragmatic method "is no other than that experimental method by which all the successful sciences (in which number nobody in his senses would include metaphysics) have reached the degrees of certainty that are severally proper to them today" (5.465). To say, as Professor Weiss does, that for Peirce the various branches of philosophy "provide" the special sciences "with their norms, ends and distinctions," is quite evi- dently a misconstruction. (3) Peirce sometimes does make semiotic distinctions in phe- nomenological terms, but he does not have to do so, and he can and does make the same distinctions in logical terms alone. The dis- tinction between different kinds of signs is not arrived at as the result of phenomenological analysis; the case is rather that, once the distinction is made, phenomenological analysis will discover in it a manifestation of the three categories, just as it can find them manifested in anything whatsoever that is given to it. Sign dis- tinctions, classifications, and analyses are made by observing "such signs as we know" (2.227), abstracting certain characteristics, and concluding what must hold good of all signs. This logical process Peirce calls "abstractive observation" or "ideal induction" (or "ideal experimentation"). It is, according to him, the instrument of mathematical reasoning; and certainly mathematics, whether in his scheme, in his procedure, or in universal estimation, is inde- pendent of phenomenology. The plain fact of the matter is that a far better case can be made out for the view that in Peirce the basic principle of phenomenology, the distinction of the three cate- gories, is suggested by a distinction within purely formal logic- that of the monadic, dyadic, and triadic forms of predicates (rhe- mata) in the logic of relatives (cf. 3.63, 3.422, 5.469). A First may be unambiguously defined as that character which would be expressed by some statement about a quality, a Second as that character expressible by a statement of a dyadic relation, a Third as that character expressible by a statement of a triadic relation; or, to use Peirce's language, the categories are the three classes of characters defined respectively by "absolute," "simple relative," and "conjugative" predicates. It is significant that when Peirce gives his demonstrations that there can be no more than three classes of indecomposable categories or predicates, these proofs are not</page><page sequence="5">268 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY based on phenomenological or metaphysical grounds but have, as he emphasizes, a purely logical or mathematical character (e.g., 1.346-7, 1.561-2, 3.63, 3.421-2). In view of the foregoing it is difficult to understand what Pro- fessor Weiss means when he calls the doctrine of categories "the essence of Peirce's system." What are these categories, anyway? Peirce vacillates between an ontological and a methodological con- ception of them. When he describes them as quality, fact, and thought, or as spontaneity, opposition, and reason, or in terms of any other such triad of concepts, he appears to warrant the former interpretation. But that he did not intend such an interpretation is clear both from his explicit declaration that phaneroscopy (phe- nomenology) "has nothing at all to do with the question of how far the phanerons it studies correspond to any realities" (1.287) and from the fact that he coined for the categories the neutral names of Firstness, Secondness, and Thirdness. The purpose of coining these names was to establish the most general possible means of discriminating all other concepts. Firstness, Secondness, and Thirdness are concepts which enable us to classify, organize, and describe any kind of experience (whether it consist in the smell of rotten cabbage or the experience of mathematical reason- ing), and they are applicable to all other concepts for this reason. Peirce has ontological "categories": mind, matter, and evolution; chance, law, and habit-taking. But these are simply one manifes- tation of the categories, neither more nor less significant than others, like the logical concepts of abduction, deduction, and induc- tion, or icon, index, and symbol. In the special sciences, the psy- chological concept of feeling, for example, is a First, the biological concept of heredity is a Second; and so on (cf. 6.32). A moment's reflection will show that neither the metaphysical nor the methodological interpretation sheds light on the assertion that the doctrine of categories is "the essence of Peirce's system." Is it the essence of the system because it suggests to him (granting this questionable point) how the sciences should be classified? We might as well argue that the concept of abduction is the essence of the system because the principles of all the sciences are hypotheses and all hypotheses are results of abduction. Does it help to define the meaning of concepts in other subject-matters? But while in- duction, for instance, is said to exemplify Thirdness, it would be as fantastic to suppose that Peirce formulates his principle of in- duction with the help of the principle of categories as to suppose that he formulates principles of the special sciences in this way simply because he categorizes their concepts. If Professor Weiss 's purpose in locating the "essence " of</page><page sequence="6">COMMENTS AND CRITICISM 269 Peirce's system is to discover the "first principles" on which this system rests, he is grossly misled by Peirce's classificatory scheme, in which phenomenology is "order 1" of philosophy. Peirce's ac- tual philosophic practice accords not with this scheme but with his fallibilism and experimentalism. One of the eloquent lessons of fallibilism is that no intellectual discipline whatever can have an absolute foundation. Neither the principle of the categories nor any other is the fountain or starting-point of his philosophy. His aim was much less to establish a fixed structure for his "system" than to discover as many independent sources of confirmation as he could for all the theories that constituted it. Order he recog- nized as an essential of intellectual economy, "as of every other" (5.392), but disproportionate attention to order is precisely his criticism of the classical philosophers; and accordingly he placed himself in the ranks of "laboratory" as opposed to "seminary" philosophy. He would hardly subscribe to the vague account of philosophy attributed to him by Professor Weiss, "a study of that which embraces all points of view." However prosaic some among us may judge him to be, the fact is that he conceived of philosophy as a science which like any science must learn to employ stern canons for the discrimination of evidence, and the ultimate goal of which is universal agreement and a uniform terminology rather than poetic expression of individual perspective. Striking testi- mony of faithfulness to the scientific ideal is his habit of pointing out and painstakingly correcting specific errors that he had com- mitted in earlier papers. Professor Weiss believes that Peirce "is about to be lost to us." It may be that by neglecting the systematic element in Peirce we are in danger of overlooking some interesting possibilities. But a much greater danger lurks, that of petrifying his philosophic re- searches, as we seem to have petrified Royce's. To strain prin- cipally for the conservation of his picturesque architectonic will scarcely be to provide the corrective which he lacked while alive. It would be better to honor him in the act, learning from the rich conceptions and potentialities of his thought by intelligent dis- section rather than by the esthetic contemplation of their dubious unity.
