'Religion' (from Hugh Ferrissy The Metropolis of Tomorrow, 1929).</page><page sequence="2">Although there was an enticing variety of building types in America at the turn of the century, the introduction of the skyscraper created a stir. Its uneasy reception was caused mostly by unfamiliarity and fear of unknown consequences. Some were shocked by the unprecedented heights, others feared problems of urban instability. These were natural reactions - the unknown tends to cause anxiety, even on a continent where it was still a com? mon experience. It is therefore interesting that another reaction was caused by the exact opposite: familiarity. With their pointed tops lift? ing above the amorphous skyline of Manhattan, the skyscrapers re 2.

Some even provoked the title 'cathedral' - because of its stepped-back sil? houette, the Paramount Building (1926) in New York was called the Cathedral of Motion Pictures (Fig.2). Names which use the cathedral as a metaphor are not uncommon, for example the Cathedral Spires of Yosemite (Fig.3). Usually the com? parison is to the cathedral's structure and interior, as in Le Corbusier's reference to the Galerie des Machines (1889) as 'cette cathedrale de fer'.1 Or it may provide some clues to serious analysis, as in the Green Ca? thedral, the centre court of Wimbledon. Although Wimbledon's centre court has nothing to do with a Gothic church, to most people it is still a thoroughly appropriate metaphor, perhaps because it characterizes the public's devotion to its heroes. In some cases the relationship must re? main obscure, as in the Cathedral of Restaurants.2 Usually, however, there is at least a formal resemblance. But innocence must end when for? mal and ideological elements are concocted in such a way that it seems to point at an impersonation of the most impudent kind. And such, it was felt, was the case with the Cathedral of Commerce. 'Not a church enters into it' It has frequently been observed that the Americans are a religious people and that they go to church in great numbers every Sunday: 'In fact, if you would use your eyes only, the first attribute you would as? cribe to the Americans would be that of a churchgoing people.'3 Church-goers there were indeed in great numbers, in the nineteenth century, but so were there many different denominations. Each prom? ising new interpretation of the Scriptures would have its own followers, and it is possible to say, with exaggeration, that there were as many sects as there were opinions. Opinion, interpretation and exegesis are the keys to explaining this unusually rich selection of religious estab? lishments. The main difference between the European and American attitudes, Paul de Rousiers noted in his La Vie Americaine (1892), was that Americans experienced religion more as a literary or quasi philosophical exercise than as devotion. Most churches created among their congregations a bond of reason rather than that of a cult, and so, he argued, they often could better be characterized as dissenting clubs rather than places of devotion.4 To foreigners it was also instantly apparent that, although the nation was teeming with churches of every imaginable denomination, there was a conspicuous absence of a national religion. James Bryce, who echoed Alexis de Toqueville in declaring that he was impressed by the religiosity of Americans, was less troubled by this absence than, say, de Rousiers. He felt quite at ease with the conclusion that it was in fact this surprising diversity which constituted what one might call 'the national religion'.5 Nevertheless, the thought of a church on the grand scale never left the minds of those who felt themselves responsible either for the re? ligious welfare of the Americans or for edifying their cultural con? science. Although the very thought of a state religion was a heresy, and contrary to the letter of the Constitution, fantasy was constantly stimulated by suggestions that splendid churches ought to be erected in the centres of prospering cities. The point was not so much to es? tablish places of worship as it was to furnish these cities with monu? ments to their prosperity and civic pride.6 For a long time the western settlements had had to make do with wandering evangelists and humble shacks for Sunday preaching, but, the moment they started to thrive, civic pride had to be reckoned with. In 1895, Montgomery Schuyler related the amusing story of 'the inhabitant of a boom town further West, who was bragging about the hotels and the saloons and the "opera house" of it to a stranger, who at last inquired about the churches. "Well, no", Occidentalis Gloriosus had to own; "there was some talk about one, but the boys thought it would look too dudish."'7 This was more or less the case with Chicago when Schuyler wrote that 'It is indeed curious how the composite image of Chicago that remains in one's memory as the sum of his numerous impressions is made up exclusively of the sky-scrapers of the city and the dwellings of the suburb. Not a church enters into it.'8 It seemed to him that Chicagoans were reluctant to spend money on churches be? cause they considered it 'a little frivolous and dilettante'.9 It is a pity that Schuyler was unaware of the observations of visitors from abroad because, though there were no 'official' churches, no 4. The Woman's Temple, Chicago, by John W. Root, 1891 (from W. H. Birkmire, Skeleton Construction in Buildings, 1894). church buildings in the traditional sense, he might have noticed that there were at least two colossal buildings of the type that de Rousiers had described as 'religious clubs', which comprised a chapel surrounded by a library, Sunday-school rooms, a billiard room, and rooms for tea 40 A A FILES 8</page><page sequence="3">parties and theatrical performances - 'a la fin j'ai eu une forte envie de lui demander: "Et le bon Dieu, dans tout cela, qu'en fakes vous?"'10 These were the Woman's Temple (1890-2) (Fig.4) and the Masonic Temple (1890-2), both by the firm of Burnham and Root. It took a native American to overlook them. That the two temples were not regarded as churches is understandable, but not consistent. After all, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, a powerful institution which was largely responsible for Prohibition, was a full-fledged daughter of the Methodist Church. Although the building it commis? sioned was to be devoted primarily to administration and other busi? ness, it nevertheless included a sanctuary at street level and, though it was never executed, a fleche in the French Gothic style. Schuyler had been misled by the hybrid character of these two prototypes, however brief their existence (they were torn down in 1922 and 1938 respect? ively), of the American metropolitan 'revenue church'. Nor was he much impressed by their architectural merits, an odd lapse of taste that he shared with later critics.11 When Schuyler declared 'that this is not a cathedral building country', he meant cathedral-cathedrals and nothing of the kind Edgar Allen Poe hinted at when he wrote that extraordinary example of perspicacity Mellonta Tauta, a scenario of New York in the twentieth century: 'It is related of them (the 'Knickerbocker Tribe9, or the New Yorkers) that they were oddly afflicted with a monomania for building what in the ancient American, was denominated "churches" - a kind of pagoda instituted for the worship of two idols that went by the name of Wealth and Fashion'12 (Fig.5). Whether this description of Manhattan, written in 1849, was the result of a magical insight, or of the collective imagination, which has the habit of depicting the city of the future as a city of towers, is of ^^^^^^ 5.

What makes this text remarkable is the fact that all towers, in other words the skyscrapers of the coming century, are called 'churches'. The worldly powers have conquered the city, and they rule it in the robes of the Church. The Cathedral of Commerce In 1913 this travesty was in fact enacted in a splendid New York sky? scraper, conceived by its owner, Frank W. Woolworth, designed by his architect, Cass Gilbert, and realized by their contractor, Louis Horo? witz. It was an ingenious whim; the building looked very much like 6.

It was called The Cathedral of Commerce (Fig.6),13 and indeed it was officially christened as such by the noted divine Dr S. Parkes Cadman. When seen at nightfall bathed in electric light or in the lucid air of summer morning, piercing space like a battlement of the paradise of God, which St. John beheld, it inspires feelings even for tears. The writer looked upon it and at once cried out 'the Cathedral of Commerce' - the chosen habitation of that spirit in man, which, through means of change and barter, binds alien people into unity and peace.14 It seems obvious that the appellation 'cathedral' was prompted by its Gothic style and form, but at the same time other analogies were com? peting for priority. This is apparent in existing texts which, with an uncommon feeling for propriety, hint at a diverse and complex body of references. The Cathedral of Commerce was designed as a place of worship; but the question still remains, the worship of what? Commerce alone will not do - there is much more to it. And what, in any case, was meant by 'commerce'? Dr Cadman wrote, 'Just as religion monopolized art and architecture during the Medieval epoch, so commerce has engrossed the United States since 1865.'15 Thus it might be said that, since commerce and religion had been brought to the same level of comparison, they were regarded as comparable. Long before Woolworth had entrusted the realization of the build? ing to his architect Cass Gilbert and his contractor Louis J. Horowitz, of the Thompson-Starrett Company, he had already thought out the building, hazily in architectural terms, but most clearly in the ideological sense. Horowitz, a feudal major-domo representing, more or less, the in? terests of his lord, who worked closely with his client as an intermediary between him and the architect, was very much aware of this. 'Whoever would try to find a reason for this tall building' and did not take into account 'that Woolworth's ego was a thing of extra size', Horowitz warned, 'would reach a false conclusion'.16 The transcendence of materialism Woolworth's motives are worth examining, because they could equally be applied to other founders of skyscrapers since they reflect quite clearly the almost tragic condition of those who had set out to 'make good'. To most Europeans making money was an evil activity, which the Americans had pursued far beyond the acceptable limits of decency. According to the Scriptures, Christianity was predominantly incom? patible with business, yet the Americans, thanks to their diverse inter? pretations of Christianity and the resulting multiplicity of opinions, treated the subject with great inventiveness and a conspicuous lack of dogmatism. Working with the sole intention of making money was held in high esteem as the democratic answer of the New World to the inequality of the feudal Old World. George Santayana located the 'unshared essence of Americanism' in its total absorption with work, combined with liberty of spirit. Work was equated with business, and business became the object of atten? tion; all else was regarded with indifference.17 The Americans' feverish pursuit of money and things was a constant preoccupation of foreign visitors, and it elicited condemnations and stern warnings, particularly from Rudyard Kipling and Matthew Arnold.18 But what they over? looked in their categorical disapproval of materialism was the ideology behind it. Theories of business such as Andrew C. Carnegie's Empire of Business (1902) were neither factual nor theoretical, but on the contrary overflowed with morality, mysticism and piety. A quasi-religious rationale for business was expounded in quaintly edifying books like The Imperial Highway, or the Road to Fortune and Happiness, with bio? graphies of Self Made Men, their Business Traits, Qualities and Habits (Chicago, 1888), and the very popular Success (1897) and Pushing to the Front by Orison Swett Marsden. Success in business was the equivalent of deliverance - the acquisition of money made man independent and liberated him from his former condition of servitude. As Alexis de Toqueville wrote in 1834, demo? cracy was another word for equality.19 Following this line of interpre? tation, James Bryce wrote in 1893, 'Democratic government has in reality not much to do with it ... More must be ascribed to the equal? ity of material conditions/20 It is this same curious deviation from the current understanding of democracy that made Frank Lloyd Wright's use of the word in 'a democratic architecture' so puzzling to the non-American reader. What he meant, in fact, was an individual, non-conformist architec? ture which would suit the equally non-conformist, uniquely individual Self-Made Man. No phrase is more revealing than this; it is the arche? typal American notion of the man who created himself, who had to invent and re-invent himself and his environment, competing with other self-made men (all starting with the proverbial equal oppor? tunities) to grab as many riches as there were lying around in that richly stocked primordial garden. Those who grabbed the most were regarded as not only most successful but also the most individual and the most 'democratic'. Sooner or later this process of auto-creation would bring the self made man face-to-face with the Creator. This confrontation would usually take place at what could be characterized as the point where the acquisition of wealth comes to a halt and where the dispensing of it begins. If the acquisition of wealth was vested with social obligation and moral responsibility, so too was the dispensing of it. Carnegie considered it immoral to sit on one's fortune: 'The epitaph which every rich man should wish himself justly entitled to is that seen upon the monument to Pitt: "He lived without ostentation, And he died poor." Such is the man whom the future is to honour, while he who dies in old age retired from business, possessed of millions of available wealth, is to die unwept, unhonoured and unsung.'21 Paedomorphosis The ritual of making money honourably obliged its participants to begin with nothing and to end with nothing; the intermediate phase was simply proof of the ability to 'make good'. It might be assumed that the most logical solution would be to refund the fortune to those who had, wholeheartedly or reluctantly, contributed to it, but this idea was rejected as prodigal, despite an eloquent appeal by Edward Bok, editor of the Ladies3 Home Journal, for a system of 'moving back of wealth to its sources', the motto being 'If I had the gift to make money, why can't I acquire the gift of giving it away?'22 This process of artificial impoverishment is related to the atavistic act of rejuvenation. In evolutionary theory it is called 'paedomor? phosis', a 'retreat from the adult to a juvenile stage as the starting point for the new line'. At certain critical stages, evolution can, in the words of Arthur Koestler, 'retrace its steps, as it were, along the path which led to the dead end and make a fresh start in a new, more promising direction.23 Paedomorphosis generally occurs in the cre? ative process, when the mind reverts to 'primitive modes of ideation, followed by a creative forward leap'.24 In the history of art, especially in what is called 'modern' art, this phenomenon can be observed in the retreat to primitive models in the work of Brancusi, Picasso, Klee and others. As I have observed elsewhere, the American skyscraper also has roots in a paedomorphic inversion of the mature refinements of civic architecture into the crude, archetypal pre-Babylonian tower. This was significantly demonstrated by James Stirling when he sculpted a sand-castle for The Sunday Times Magazine of 17 August 1980(Fig.7).25 Complementary to this principle of 'reculer pour mieux sauter' were numerous religious notions, of not only Christianity but also American transcendentalism, of the inevitability of death and the 42 AA FILES 8</page><page sequence="5">7. Paedomorphic architecture: James Stirling and his Babylonian sand-castle (from The Sunday Times Magazine, 17August 1980). obligation to favour the conditions of new life. Emerson compacted this philosophy into the aphorism 'Life only avails, not the having lived/26 Similarly, the conduct of business must not be impeded by retrospection and it should be resuscitated periodically by the removal of its burden of sufficiency. Sufficiency was regarded as the main impediment to a succesful career in business, hence President Garfield's famous dictum, 'The richest heritage a young man can be born to is poverty.' In an address of 1885 to students in Pittsburgh, Carnegie went as far as to 'congratulate poor young men upon their being born to that ancient and honourable degree which renders it necessary that they should devote themselves to hard work'.27 A slightly modified version of this pattern may be found in the life histories of some of the greatest American artists, for example Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright, in which the artist is deprived of a solid upbringing and education and, as an autodidact, recreates him? self.28 But 'success' and 'survival' in the field of business were uniquely dependent, not on education, but on the ability to compete. Competition The natural condition of American business is competition, in which free and independent individuals engage in battle with total commit? ment to the laws of nature. The rules of the battle are few but relentlessly clear. As Geoffry Gorer wrote, 'Control over people - authority - is always morally bad; (but) control over things, or abstractions envisaged as things (natural resources, goods, services, money, chattels) - power - is morally neutral and even, within certain ill-defined limits, highly praiseworthy.'29 Success was the measure of right. In his celebrated essay on 'Self Reliance' (1841) Emerson expounded the unity of independent action and the laws of nature, and so prepared the way for the 'self-helping' man who would find the laws of nature on his side as long as he held fast to his integrity: 'Power is in nature the essential measure of right.'30 The power which Frank W. Woolworth had accumulated by 1900 was embodied in fifty-nine stores with annual sales of five million dollars and in a palatial mansion on 'Millionaires' Row', Fifth Avenue, New York. Following the rules of the myth, Woolworth was the pro? duct of a modest upbringing, he had grossly neglected school, and he had developed a taste for vulgarity. In his palace on Fifth Avenue he installed the first of a series of increasingly grandiose mechanical pipe organs, about which Louis Horowitz respectfully recalled: His favourite toy was an electrical reproducing pipe organ, the ducts of which were cunningly placed throughout the palace-like interior. Many times I watched him at the organ. Other minds, other skills conceived the music, but his was the will to control the speed and the volume. He told me that this playing gave him exquisite pleasure; when he was tired or vexed he would play for hours, not stopping until he was relaxed and easy in his mind.31 What Horowitz did not mention was the extraordinary light-shows and 'artistic' visual effects that accompanied the music. 'Just before the open ing of a great orchestral classic,' Woolworth's posthumous biographer John K. Winkler wrote, 'with the room in darkness, a magnificent oil portrait of the composer - Wagner or Beethoven, Liszt or Mendelssohn - would appear in a panel on top of the wall, at first faintly, then grow? ing clearer and clearer until the vision was developed in light.'32 Owing to a lack of proper schooling and a self-imposed exile from the world of high culture, the self-made man finds himself, at a certain point, facing a higher state of life, to which he feels obliged to respond. But the problem is that, because of his ethos of individualism, the self-made man has no tradition, let alone a cultural tradition, to fall back upon. The logical consequence is that, if there is to be a culture, it has to be an in? stant, self-made culture. Self-culture This condition had been discerned and diagnosed in preceding periods as 'self-culture'.33 There is no theory of what constitutes self-culture but, if it had to be constructed, it ought to contain at least three ingredients: an insistence on resurrecting juvenile fantasies and dreams; an inclination to justify the current mode of life by identifying with famous self-made men of the past; and an edge of insanity. Woolworth's infernal pipe-organ made him 'relaxed and easy in the mind' whenever he was 'tired or vexed'. (This confidence in the thera? peutic effects of his infernal machinery he shared with fictional 'vexed' organists such as Count Dracula and Captain Nemo.) Not so eccentric, and indeed traditional, was Woolworth's awakening ambition to be Napoleon. On the fortieth floor of his building were his private and executive offices. The latter, called the Empire Room, was furnished as if it were Napoleon's own room. Horowitz described it as follows: 'His marbled office in the completed building gave a clue to how the Wool worth Building's owner felt. The furnishings were all French Empire things; upon the wall just where his gaze would fall most often was a full length portrait of Napoleon in his coronation robes and, beside him, Josephine' (Fig.8).34 Woolworth's candidness about his 'kingly afflic? tion', as Horowitz called it, is touching. In a letter of 20 February 1914, which he dispatched to all his stores, he described his new habitat. Apart 8. "TheEmpireRoom\ Frank W. Woolworth's office in the Woolworth Building (from The Cathedral of Commerce, 1916). from the portrait of Napoleon,' copied directly from the picture at Ver? sailles', there were a life-size bust of him and an ink-well 'that was bought in Paris and represents Napoleon on horseback in bronze. A smaller figure of Napoleon is a paper weight, 100 years old.' And so on.35 The parallels to Woolworth's own career were irresistible: Napoleon was also a self-made man and, moreover, he had built, in the shortest possible time, a vast empire, with little more than his own genius.

Bishop George Berkeley had predicted this in the early eighteenth century: Westward the course of empire takes its way; The first four Acts already past, A fifth shall close the Drama with the day; Time's noblest offspring is the last.36 The Hudson School painter Thomas Cole had illustrated it in the se? quence 'Course of Empire' of 1830.37 And whoever invented the name Empire State for the State of New York must have acknowledged this ideal. Naturally, the Empire State Building was intended as the ideo? logical capitol of its own mystic realm.38 'Gloria de' Prencipi' Competition in business results not necessarily in the humiliation of the defeated but rather in the material gain of the victor. When Woolworth entered into competition with his equals and defeated them, he was con? tent to let his balance-sheet speak for itself. The satisfaction and glory, on the other hand, he sublimated into his impersonation of Napoleon. He was not the only businessman who had undergone this metamor? phosis at the summit of his career. Woolworth's successor in the firm from 1919-32 'too, became obsessed with ideas of Napoleonic gran? deur',39 and Paul Starrett, the contractor and colleague of Horowitz, noted in his memoirs: 'Harry Black, my boss, had a Napoleon complex. Like Napoleon, and those Napoleons of my day, Harriman, Jim Hill, J. P. Morgan, Black loved to amalgamate and to expand.'40 Although this behaviour might be interpreted as epidemic mental regression, it should be regarded rather as the usual pattern of self culture at the high tide of a millionaire's fulfilment. Its complement is the rejection of power over people and its transfer to things.41 This is perhaps one of the most important aspects of the American skyscraper phenomenon: if power could be transferred to matter, this matter could then be transformed into buildings. The archetypal and anthropo? morphic tower, with its resemblance to the human form and its domi? nating presence, was the ideal symbol of its master. Skyscrapers acted as architectural mercenaries in the battle of competition. (In The American Scene of 1907, Henry James described the skyscrapers of downtown Manhattan as 'mercenary monsters'.42) The final element of the passion which inspired Woolworth to erect his stupendous tower on Broadway at City Hall Park was a desire for immortality. The architect Leopold Eidlitz wrote, in his influential theory of architecture The Nature and Function of Art, more Especially of Architecture (New York, 1881), that 'The origin of architecture must be thought in the desire of man to live after death. This short life of ours is devoted to live as long as we can ... After this we desire to connect our individuality with the cosmic spirit, that it may outlast our body and become immortal.'43 The idea of architecture as a data bank of the past is best known through Victor Hugo's Notre-Dame de Paris and John Ruskin's 'The Lamp of Memory' ('for it is in becoming memorial or monumental that a true perfection in architecture is attained by civil and domestic buildings').44 In 1929 Wilbur Foshay, a kitchen-utensils magnate from Minneapolis, Minnesota, converted his fortune into an office building in the shape of an obelisk (Fig.9). He had his name engraved on the four sides of the building, at about the same height where, to speak in anthropomorphic terms, a tennis player's headband displaying the name of his sponsor would be. Hardly anybody now knows to whom or what the name Foshay refers. Wilbur Foshay the man is forgotten, but the monument which carries his name is alive and well and popular enough to appear, wearing a yellow bow-tie around its 'neck', in a Time magazine special report of 2 February 1981 on the homecoming of the Iranian hostages (Fig.10). Foshay, who ruined himself with this breathtaking project, and ended up in gaol, had two objectives: one was immortality and the other was to be George Washington. The means he used to achieve these were as sim? ple as they were effective. The erection of an obelisk had been a tradi? tional means of commemorating princely rulers (see Cesare Ripa's Iconologia of 1611) (Fig. 11).45 George Washington, the first president of the last empire - to paraphrase Berkeley - had been immortalized by the Washington Monument, an outsized obelisk 550 feet high. Like the sorcerer's apprentice, Foshay followed the magic formula step by step: first he had himself transformed into a building that would bear his memory into the future - his name had to be etched into the stone so that it could never be erased; then he constructed the building in the form of an obelisk resembling the one that represented his worshipped hero; and the two converged, as if in an Ovidian metamorphosis. A local poet jingled accordingly: A symbol of that other shaft Revered the nation thru The vision of a dreaming lad In stone and steel come true. The complex explanation which accompanied the Woolworth Build? ing included a claim that it was 'a monument to small things' and that it was 'the colossal and enduring gift to civilization of a trueborn, patriotic American, Frank W. Woolworth, and it stands unique in the history of great buildings throughout the world in that it is without a mortgage or dollar indebtedness'. The building was conceived, in other words, as a memorial to the means by which its owner had assembled his fortune, namely nickels and dimes, the 'atomic elements' of capitalism. But it also represented Woolworth's preparations for the hereafter: the money was being returned to the public in the form of a building that was with? out the sin of usury.46 In the main hall of the Cathedral of Commerce is a bust of Wool worth (Fig. 12) which depicts him dispensing money with a regal gesture which recalls that of the 'jovial' ruler in Michelangelo's Tomb of Giuliano de' Medici (Fig.13).47 The enduring nature of Woolworth's 'gift' is symbolized by its medieval style, and its architect, Cass Gilbert, holding a model of the building, is sculpted as the magister opens (Fig. 14), in the tradition of Peter Parler's bust in the triforium of Prague Ca? thedral (Fig. 15). In the same vein is the luxuriously presented dedication booklet of 1913, which bears the title 'The Master Builders'. (It should here be noted that the skyscrapers of the 'heroic' period, 1875-1929, were exclusively 'hand-made' and never, as is so often misunderstood, or wilfully misinterpreted, in the Giedionesque, machine-age-type text? books, prefabricated or factory-made products.) 16.

MfHT? liiw ? miffi i ?? i I i^^^^HW^ - Jt*'* 3^^B^^9^^^H It is here that the metaphor of the cathedral makes its appearance. Once money and power have been accumulated, and the days of Napoleon are past, it is time for charity - the building is a public instead of private palace. And since Woolworth wanted to be no less a prince than Napoleon, he would be no less a prelate than Christ himself. High on the building, where the tower soars upward, is the figure of a pelican, the symbol of self-sacrifice and of the Redeemer (Fig. 16). The Cathedral of Commerce becomes a kind of Jacob's ladder, a connection between heaven and earth, an axis mundi. As Le Corbusier so rightly observed, 'Face au vieux continent eile (New York) a installe Pechelle de jacob des temps nouveaux. Un choc dans le ventre qu'on encaisse en ouragan.'48 The Cathedral of Learning When Colonel W. A. Starrett, another macro-contractor from the Star rett family, wrote that 'building skyscrapers is the nearest peace-time equivalent of war',49 he was hinting at, amongst other things, the de structive forces that could be generated by these juggernauts. As myth? ology teaches us, war and destruction are constituents of the act of cre? ating order;50 thus the destructive force of the skyscraper was called forth to create order in the American wilderness. Which it did: the im? age of the medium-sized town clustered around a skyscraper - where in the old days there would have been a church or a town hall - is familiar enough. On the other hand, this destructive force could also strike out at its maker. Building costs were often prohibitive, loans and taxes could swallow millions, and many builders of skyscrapers perished by them or with them.51 This is exactly how it went with the 'Cathedral of Learning'. The Cathedral of Learning was as blatant an example of recycled Gothic as the Cathedral of Commerce. Designed by the architect Charles Z. Klauder and the Chancellor of the University of Pittsburgh, John G. Bowman, it was built between 1926 and 1937 (Fig. 17). The pro? gramme was as simple as it was profound: 'to express the meaning of a AA FILES 8 47</page><page sequence="10">University by a great high building'.52 This was not a new idea, nor one that was necessarily inspired by the possibilities of skyscraper construc? tion. Antonio Averlino, called 'II Filarete' (he who loves virtue), had already designed and described, in the mid-fifteenth century, a tower of learning, which he named the House of Virtue. Into it he incorporated a De Sade-like philosophy, in which the highest level of wisdom could be achieved only after an initial period of bawdiness, followed by the progressive accumulation of virtue. This path of gradual detachment from material things is expressed in successive levels of the building. On the ground floor are brothels and drinking saloons; on the second floor, dormitories for prostitutes and the police headquarters; on the third floor the revels end and the studies begin; and from the fourth floor up? ward there is the usual array of liberal arts, until the observation plat? form is reached, where the art of astronomy is used to explore all of Creation, Heaven as well as Earth. A similar programme was incorporated into August Perret's famous 'spiritual skyscraper' which he designed at the end of the sixteenth century (Fig. 18).

The significant difference between the Cathedral of Learning and its forerunners, and a characteristic of a great deal of American building culture, is that it was actually realized - the transcendence, once again, of materialism. From a practical point of view there was absolutely no need to build high; the University of Pittsburgh owned large expanses of land, and building in the horizontal direction would have been more useful and economical. Here the inherent contradictions of material transcendentalism are clearly illustrated. Naturally, appeals were made to efficiency and common sense, but only half-heartedly, as a necessary ritual performed for the benefit of the less imaginative investors.The weight of the argument was concentrated at the other extreme, in the almost religious fanaticism with which 'believers' were admonished to sacrifice their worldly goods to a work that was 'Forceful, unafraid, sublime, with a sense of upwardness; it starts our accustomed limits of thought and life to move farther away.'54 The structure was to be 680 feet and 52 storeys high, and the style had to be Gothic. The ground floor was to be occupied by a vast hall in the guise of a Gothic cathedral, surrounded by a ring of so-called 'nationality rooms', classrooms decor? ated in the manner of the different ethnic groups of Pennsylvania - mythical reconstructions of a lost past, souvenirs of places never visited. The significance of this impressive undertaking is, of course, its un? diluted aspiration to express the 'Idea of Universal Learning'55 by equating it with what had become the national means of expression: height. Once again, the dream of Jacob (Genesis 28:12-16) had been re? created in skyscraper matter. The Jacob's ladder illustrated in Robert Fludd's Utriusque Cosmi Majoris ... II oi 1619 clearly shows the pro? gressive stages of learning (as in Perret's and Filarete's models) which lead to such perfection that, by completing the final phase (in this case verbum - 'the word' - rather than Filarete's astronomy), one almost automatically enters into Heaven. When the Crash finally came, in 1929, the Cathedral of Learning was not yet finished. The community had ruined itself and was left with empty pockets and half a tower. However, Bowman began, even in the deepest depths of the Depression, to collect funds to get the tower tem? porarily patched up with cloth and board, until finally, in 1937, he had gathered enough money together by exciting patriotic and religious sentiments - just as in medieval practice - to complete it to its proper splendour.56 'Restore the Cross to the Skyline!' It is no surprise that the Church should react quite quickly to the intru? sions of the worldly skyscrapers into its traditional domain, at first with a sense of injury and injustice, later with bitterness, and still later with publicly displayed vindictiveness. The objections were mainly to the way in which the skyscrapers loomed over and dominated existing church buildings, which had hitherto been the sole connections be? tween heaven and earth. Ralph Adams Cram, an eminent church builder of stern authority, had begun his attacks on the skyscraper as early as 1899: The church must adapt itself to new conditions, conform in measure to its en? vironment ... We find churches with low walls, many little features, slender spires, and all other accessories of country design, set down in the immediate proximity of blocks of dwellings or mercantile buildings that lift absurdly above them, crushing them into ignominy, making towers that do not rise above the neighbouring corniches grotesque and laughable.57 First to be eclipsed by the commercial towers of New York was 19. Trinity Church eclipsed by the Irving Trust Building (from A. T. Leitick New York, 1932). 48 AA FILES 8</page><page sequence="11">49</page><page sequence="12">Trinity Church, at the junction of Broadway and Wall Street. Although the wealth of that parish was, and still is, enormous, it began to lose most of its parishioners, who moved uptown, until finally it was lost in the forest of tall buildings surrounding it (Fig. 19). In the end its sole raison d'etre was to act as a yardstick against which the skyscrapers could be measured, and even to inspire boasts that they had 'dwarfed' or 'eclipsed that noble church of Trinity'.58 Cram's wrath was transmitted to his pupil Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue, who in 1921 designed the formidable Convocation Tower.59 A rendering, for which it is renowned, was executed by Hugh Ferriss in his usual forbidding style: a total blackout of charcoal sweeps, broken here and there by patches of white, an explosion of light at the base that suggests a certain weightlessness, and a small but intense white light at the top, a cross exploding like a nova (Fig.20). This was the Avenging Angel set loose to punish the worldly pretenders. Its location was to be Madison Square, a natural arena were it could crush both the Metro? politan Life Tower and that already ageing gladiator, the Flatiron (Fuller) Building. The drawing was exhibited in Chicago (the city 'not a church entered into') at the Annual Architectural Exhibition of April 1922, and it was a smashing success. The Western Architectwrote, 'Bertram G. Goodhue's perspective of his proposed Convocation and Office Building, to house the centralized activities of the Protestant denominations, dominated the room in which it was hung, and, of course, was the wonderful draw? ing of the exhibition.'60 Here was the solution: a church and office tower in one! The idea was an immediate success and came to be known as the 'revenue church' (Fig.21).61 Although the Convocation Tower, alas, was never realized, it did produce a noble successor - the Chicago Temple, the First Metho? dist Church of Chicago, by Holabird and Roche, of 1924 (Fig.22). The project was published in Chicago Commerce of 8 September 1923: 'Stan? ding 556 feet from the street level to the tip of its spire, The Chicago Temple is the second highest building in the world ... It is the highest church in existence, being taller by a liberal margin than any European cathedral. It is also one foot higher than the Washington Monument.'62 It was a foregone conclusion that the existing height-restricting or? dinance of Chicago would have to be waived - after all, to be varied whenever it seemed appropriate was the justification for its existence. And it seemed right, to many Chicagoans, and to its powerful Methodist congregation (we are in the middle of Prohibition, a battle successfully waged by Methodism), to call the New York skyscrapers of the twenties to order, so that the Church might re-establish its dominance in the sky. This was done in the most literal fashion imaginable. The building is shaped like an ambitious office tower, but on its 'shoulders' it carries a 'sky-chapel', a sort of miniature Sainte-Chapelle, accessible by an ex? press elevator. The sky-chapel is, in essence, the ingeniously devised storeroom of the building's manifest conscience. It contains an unusual illuminated relief depicting Christ on the Mount of Olives, lamenting the destiny of Jerusalem: 'If thou hadst known' (Luke 19:42) (Fig.23). This tableau is the counterpart of a similar one in the street-level sanc? tuary, in which Christ is again shown brooding over Jerusalem, but in this instance looking out over the steeples of profanity: Christ is looking down upon the Chicago Loop! Not hills and huts of clay, but the Union Carbide Building, the Lincoln Tower and the no doubt hated Jewelers' Building, the most notable victim of the Temple's dominating height (Fig.24).? Although it was designed by a well respected firm, the Chicago Temple remained relatively unknown, owing mainly to the disdain of the Modernists, who found it all in very bad taste. Thus it was ignored by post-Giedion American architectural historians, notably the local ideologist of the Chicago School, Carl W. Condit.64 A visiting Modern? ist, Knud L?nberg-Holm (who became famous for his unsubmitted entry for the Chicago Tribune Competition), made a drawing of the Temple and sent it to his friend J. J. P. Oud in Holland. On the verso he wrote, 'Chicago DaDa Gotik'.65 The religious reveil began to invade all the big-city centres. The Methodist Church proved particularly aggressive in this. Sky churches were to be built, from 1924 onward, in Miami, Pittsburgh, Minneapolis, Philadelphia and, in the heart of where it had all begun, New York City.66 Here, as if having foreseen the deluge of 1929, the Methodist community of New York concentrated its efforts on a final, all-out attack. The Broadway Temple was to be the tallest building of all time - the Ultimate Avenging Angel - and it was to be built high upon the rocks of Upper Manhattan, in what is known as Washington Heights (Fig.25). The aspirations of the builders were encapsulated in a single slogan: 'Restore the Cross to the Skyline!'67 Theomorphism The rationale for this Babylonian act was elucidated in the Broadway Temple album (Fig.26): For much too long a time, here in New York, secular architecture has dominated the scene. Manhattan boasts a 'Cathedral of Commerce' even a 'Cathedral of the Motion Pictures' - While office buildings, hotels and immense towering apart? ment houses dwarf (!) the tallest church spires, making the visible emblems of religion less and less conspicuous and planting in the young minds the idea that religion has ceased to be important. How far is the process to go? Build! Put the symbol of our saviour's dying love high above Manhattan, a sign and wonder, flashing back the sunlight by day and brilliantly luminous at night. Literally as well as figuratively: Let Your Light Shine!!68 It is apparent from this text that the chief object of attack was the Woolworth Building. Phrases like 'flashing back the sunlight' and 'brilliantly luminous at night' were actually lifted from Woolworth's dedication booklets. Suggestive drawings emphasizing the dominance and visibility of the Woolworth Building (Fig.27) were paraphrased by the Broadway Temple's designers (Fig.28) in order to make clear that the imposter was to be defeated by its own weapons.69 For the sake of com? parison, the Broadway Temple - in reality several miles north of the business district - was drawn on a spot conveniently close to Madison Square and the Metropolitan Life Tower. The moon which hovered near the summit of the Woolworth Building had slipped squarely behind the Broadway Temple, as if to provide it with a natural halo, a halo that remained in all its representations - instead of being an? thropomorphic, the building had become 'theomorphic'. What the few sources which mention this ambitious project fail to tell us is that it was indeed excecuted, at least in part. Financial backing was generous and the best available designers were commissioned. Donn Barber, an outstanding and imaginative New York architect, drew up the original plans and it was Hugh Ferriss who made the presentation drawings (Fig.25). Barber died shortly thereafter, in 1925, and the work was continued by the firm of Voorhees, Gmelin and Walker. Later still, after World War II, the building was brought to its present, unfinished, state by Shreve, Lamb and Harmon, the architects of the Empire State Building. What stands now are the two flanking apartment towers which were intended to bring in most of the revenues (Fig.29). The central tower, with its colossal sanctuary, theatre, swimming pools, basketball courts, Sunday schools and office quarters, never got off the ground. The war that Colonel Starrett had hinted at was fierce and destructive. The church spent all its money on a last attack, and the Crash of '29 did the rest. In the same year Hugh Ferriss published a collection of his drawings, The Metropolis of Tomorrow - but it certainly is not a view of 'tomor? row'. On the contrary, the dark, charcoal-drawn silhouettes of colossal but insubstantial buildings are a retrospective of pre-deluge architecture. The tallest figure by far is Religion, a sky-church, in which are housed Faith, Hope and Charity (Fig.l). In its asthenic verticality, Religion, like its profane contemporaries, such as the extremely frail Mather (now 50 AA FILES 8</page><page sequence="13">21.

Michigan Tower (1928), in Chicago, and the Bank of Manhattan Building (now 40 Wall Street) (1929) and the Chrysler Building (1929), in New York, recalls the attenuated figures of Pontormo and Parmigianino. It seems - though this is an utterly ir? responsible suggestion - that the aesthetic ideal of Mannerism, together with its vague but alluring relation to the Counter-Reformation recuperation of the Catholic Church, haunted the desperate verticalism of the days of Prohibition, Fundamentalism and Black Wednesday, Thursday and Tuesday. In any case, Hugh Ferriss was sufficiently aware of the similarities between his city of doomed shadows and its grim biblical models. The final page of The Metropolis of Tomorrow is sug? gestively damaged on the lower right-hand corner, and the phrase 'who is made in the image of God' is violently interrupted, as if scorched by the approaching fire of His wrath (Fig.30). 30.

Although Sigfried Giedion greatly admired Chicago commercial architecture, he had no eye for skyscrapers. He included, in Space, Time and Architecture (1947), a dramatic full-page photograph of Randolph Street taken some time after 1892 and featuring the Ashland, Schiller and Masonic buildings, which he captioned thus: 'Chicago in the early nineties: Randolph Street about 1891. The large buildings here are the offices, built by Burnham and Root in 1891.' The Masonic Temple, by far the tallest building of its time, is not mentioned. Although it must be said that in Giedion's time Root's work was not yet fully appreciated, disapproval of the Masonic Temple as well as the Woman's Temple is typical of the circles of American, and more specifically mid Western, architectural historians operating in Giedion's ideological wake. Carl W. Condit, for example, was unhappy with the two because they were not in line with the canonic flat roof and suppression of ornament (The Chicago School of Architecture (Chicago, 1964), pp. 105-7). 12.

Emile Zola described, in his Au Bonheur des Dames (1833), the paradigmatic department store Au bon Marche (1873-6) as follows: 'C'etait la Cathedrale de Commerce Moderne, solide et legere, fake pour un peuple des clientes.' There is reason to believe that the name 'cathedral' had already been sug? gested by Woolworth during early negotiations with contractors. Paul Starrett, com? peting with Horowitz, made a point of talking Woolworth out of using terracotta for the cladding of the frame. Instead he strongly urged the application of stone because 'all great cathedrals which were the inspiration of his building were built of stone' (Paul Starrett, Changing the Skyline (New York and London, 1938), p. 167). 14.

To be published shortly. Jacques Hermant, visiting Chicago on behalf of the Gazette des Beaux-Arts in 1893, was much impressed by the Chicago skyscrapers' single, simple and brutal statement of tallness. He analysed this phenomenon, combined with what he called 'primitive ornament' (possibly referring to the organic decoration of Sullivan), as 'la vraie cre? ation d'un peuple nouveau, primitif en art, inconscient de ses propres forces, qui begaye (babbles) et ne sait que ce que les autres lui on appris' (L'Art a l'exposition de Chicago', Gazette des Beaux-Arts (1893), vol.X, 3e serie, pp.245-6). 26.

The highly successful Starrett brothers all began their careers after an aborted high-school education: 'Theodore was about to graduate from Lake Forest, but old Dr. Gregory, the president, said he couldn't get a 54 AA FILES 8</page><page sequence="17">a diploma until he made up a biblical course which he had flunked. Theodore decided to use that as an excuse to quit school and go to work. Ralph and I decided to quit, also, and we did. Theodore was eighteen, I was sixteen, Ralph was fourteen. That was the last of school for the three of us. We all got jobs in Chicago.' A telling story. Doubtless a good education for all, one of the ideals of American democracy, was still held in high esteem, yet working was regarded as manlier and a sign of self-reliance, therefore morally superior. A strong specimen of the anti-educational ideology is Orison Swett Marsden's chapter on 'The Help Yourself Society', in his book Success (Boston, Mass., 1897),pp.l40-68. The mistrust of education among American architectural historians was, and still is, such that they have treated the Columbian Exposition of 1893 as an act of treason, by a bunch of effeminate European-educated gentlemen, against the original and self sufficient Chicago School. It is impossible to find an exception to this rule, just as it would be difficult to single out any of the architectural histories as most exemplary in illustrating this train of thought. Wayne Andrews's Architecture, Ambition and Americans (1947) (New York and London, 1964) is a parody of its kind: for the glorification of Sullivan's tragic failures in higher education, see pp.214-217; for Wright, who 'was only eighteen when he quit the School of Engineering at the University of Wisconsin to look for work', pp.230-1; for Holabird, who 'failed to graduate from West Point', p.210; for the 'pernicious' influence of the gentlemen from the East, pp.220ff. Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead{New York, 1943) remains unsur? passed in its infantile heroization of the abovementioned characteristics.

Joseph Masheck's unpublished dissertation, 'Irish Church-Building Between the Treaty of Limerick and the Great Famine' (New York, 1973), led me to this interpretation of obelisk-shaped buildings. 46. The average commercial skyscraper erected in the business centres of the so-called boom-towns was usually the product of speculative building and development. The tall buildings of Chicago from the early 1880s onward are a case in point. The Boston firm of Peter Brooks and Shepard was the most prolific of this type of developer. See Carl W. Condit, The Chicago School of Architecture (Chicago and London, 1973), pp.5 Iff., and Earle Shultz and Walter Simmons, Offices in the Sky (Indianapolis and New York, 1959), pp.20ff. Speculative building was not always favourably received. Charles Harris Whitaker, in his The Story of Architecture, from Rameses (sic) to Rockefeller (New York, 1934), made a point of condemning anything that even resembled a skyscraper as a pernicious contribution to civilization. Writing in the aftermath of the Crash of 1929, he characterized the skyscraper thus: 'Skyscrapers are ... buildings, the first purpose of which is to enable the individual, or group, to cash in on land' (p.287), and 'Against the rising billions of debt that rested on nothing but human congestion, skyscrapers rose endlessly' (p.295). Against this it is important to realize that Woolworth wanted his skyscraper to be as 'clean' as possible. 47. See Erwin Panofsky, 'The Neoplatonic Movement and Michelangelo', in Studies in Iconology(New York, Evanston and London, 1962), p.211: 'Giuliano, on the other hand, holds a princely sceptre and with his open left he offers two coins. Both these motifs, symbolically contrasting him who "spends" himself in outward action with him who "shuts himself off" in self-centered contemplation, are described by Ripa under the heading "Magnanimita," and this is just as much a Jovial trait as parsimony is a Saturnian one: "Iupiter dat magnanimitatem animi,"'. The popular interpretation of the bust of Woolworth is that he is depicted counting his nickels and dimes. 48. 'Facing the old Continent, New York has installed the Jacob's ladder of modern times.

Expressions like 'to dwarf and 'to eclipse' were frequently used in the competition among the builders of commercial skyscrapers. In the Real Estate Record and Builders Guide, 1 September 1888, p. 1064, the new building for The World newspaper on Newspaper Row, New York City, is announced in the following terms: 'When the World building is completed, the Sun (another newspaper) will be overshadowed by the other newspaper established nearby. It will never do for that bright paper to be eclips? ed in any way.' In Munsey's Magazine, XII (February 1895), p.526, George Holme wrote, 'Trinity's spire was for a long time the pride of New York, as its highest struc? ture, but now it is being dwarfed by the huge office buildings.' The City Bank and Farmers' Trust published a booklet to inaugurate their new office tower at 22 William Street, New York City, in 1931 (Cross &amp; Cross, architects), which included a section of Joshua Beal's panoramic photograph of Lower Manhattan in 1876 (featuring, by the way, the earliest skyscrapers: the Western Union Building of 1875 and the Tribune Building of the same year, which went unnoticed by the publishers), to which the following caption was added: 'New York in 1874 (sic) when Trinity Church tower had no skyscraper competition' ('The Oldest Trust', 1931, p. 15). For Beal's photograph, see Mary Black, Old New York in Early Photographs, 1853-1901 (New York, 1973), pp.vi-x. 59.

Ferriss AA FILES 8 55</page><page sequence="18">published the drawing in his Metropolis of Tomorrow (New York, 1929), p.39, and wrote, 'This structure was proposed for a site adjoining Madison Square Garden; as may be guessed from its appearance, it was to house, on the main floor, a great auditorium (in fact a church) and above this, the huge shaft containing offices was to rise some thousand feet from the ground' (p.40). The thousand-foot target had been, since the mid-nineteenth century, the recurring standard of the upward-reaching architec? tural imagination. Thousand-foot towers were designed by the dozens for post-1851 world exhibitions. It should be noted that the odd 304.8 metre height of the Eiffel Tower was merely the metric equivalent of 1,000 feet. 60. The Western Architect, 31 (April 1922), p.50, plate 1. It is significant that those who kept apart from the trends of progressivism and modernism in American architectural history, G. H. Edgell for example, considered Goodhue to be the most original ar? chitect of his time. Edgell even gave the Convocation Temple the place of honour as the frontispiece of his The American Architecture of Today (New York and London, 1928) - a refreshing book indeed. 61. The idea of combining a church with other, secular, services was not an invention of the 1920s. Churches combined with shops had already existed in Europe, for example the church of S. Pietro di Banchi in Genoa, rebuilt in 1583, 'nella bizzarra mistione di architettura sacra e profana' (Guida dyItalia: Liguria, TCI Guide (Milan, 1967), p. 143), and in the United States, in New England, where several such churches were built in the 1830s (Journal ofthe Society of Architectural Historians (May 1980), p. 178-9). Indeed, American Methodism prided itself in having a considerable tradition in this field: 'To many an onlooker the combination of church and commercial building has the charm of novelty. One such enthusiast remarked the other day, "Just see how the mind of John Wesley still energizes Christianity! he was the prince of innovators, and the church is nothing if not inventive." ... Tremont Temple, in Boston, includes stores and offices. It was built thirty-two years ago ... The Old South, Congregational, in Boston, built stores on the land between parsonage and meeting-house in 1800. The idea of building them originated in 1771' (Finish the Broadway Temple (New York, 1928), p.23). 62. 'Chicago Temple: Wonder of Churches', Chicago Commerce, 8 September 1923, pp.9-10.1 am indebted to Robert Bruegman, who brought this rare article to my attention. 63. From a theological as well as mythological point of view, this is too wonderful a coin? cidence to be true, and in fact it is not. The Jewelers' Building (Thielbar and Fugard, architects, 1926) changed hands just after the building was put into operation, and by 1927 it had become the Pure Oil Building. 64. The Chicago Temple is not mentioned in Condit's main work on the architecture of Chicago, The Chicago School of Architecture: A History of Commercial and Public Building in the Chicago Area 1875-1925 (Chicago and London, 1973), nor do the ar? chitectural guidebooks of the 1970s list it. In his Chicago 1910-1929 (Chicago and Lon? don, 1973), Condit refers to it briefly as 'this curiosity' (p. 100). 65.
