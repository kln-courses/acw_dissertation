<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sacred Mountains in Chinese Art. By KIYOHIKO MUNAKATA. Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1991. vii, 200 pp. $34.95. The subject is a grand one, with deep roots and a broad shadow; both the book and the exhibition it catalogues, held at the University of Illinois in Champaign- Urbana and at the Metropolitan Museum in New York in 1990-91, are the fruits of a long investigation by a scholar both learned and imaginative. Kiyohiko Munakata analyzes the religious concepts surrounding the early development of landscape art, and demonstrates the continuing vitality of those concepts in later times when the depiction of mountains had seemingly become quite secularized. This is particularly significant for the study of Chinese painting, to which a large portion of the catalogue is devoted. It's long been recognized that Chinese landscape painting, by and large, is not primarily descriptive but subjective and interpretive; but this subjectivity has been understood mainly in terms of personal expression, Confucian self-cultivation, and social values-concerns essentially rational and secular. The mystical side of landscape painting has been largely passed over. In recent years its importance has come to seem obvious, and has been acknowledged in a number of studies of specific works or types. Sacred Mountains addresses the subject both broadly and directly. Drawing on numerous scholarly studies of this and related questions, filling in gaps and discerning meaningful patterns, it leaves the study of the iconography of Chinese landscape representation much further along than it was. A lengthy essay on the evolving concept of mountains in early Chinese thought and art introduces the catalogue. In ancient times, the mountain was seen as a cosmic pole between the earthly and heavenly spheres, traversed by shamans on errands of communication and by the souls of the dead. The journey through this realm, a wilderness of spirits and monsters, was terrifying and fantastic: the imagery on bronze vessels of the Warring States period, corresponding to passages in early portions of the Shanhai jing and in the Chu ci, shows mountains populated by wild animals, monsters, and strange composite deities, and hunters driving away or slaying the wilderness beasts. Munakata interprets the hunts as spirit-exorcisms, or ritual enactments of them. By early Han, with the emergence of the cult of immortality and the paradise imagery of Mount Kunlun, mountains took on a more hospitable guise as dimensions of a cosmic order, a benign realm through which boons could be sought. In art of this period, such as inlaid bronze tubes and the painted coffins from Mawangdui, the mountains are animated by a benificent vital essence, yunqi; the setting has a festive or pastoral air; the journey seems glad and auspicious; and the anthropomorphic figures include amiable-looking winged deities, gradually replacing the demonic spirits and embattled shamans of earlier times. In the late Han and Six Dynasties, as immortality-seekers began to visit and retire to the mountains, these spritelike divinities were in turn replaced by scholars and sages in a new "humanized" vision of sacred spaces inhabited by gracious enfranchised beings. The author's panoramic account of this history is punctuated by frequent plunges into depth for detailed scrutiny of specific topics, such as a daring reconstruction of Gu Kaizhi's lost painting of Mount Yuntai and the landscape style of his time (late fourth-early fifth centuries), to mention only one of many. Many more such</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS-CHINA AND INNER ASIA 153 clearly focused, penetrating studies appear among the catalogue entries, which cover a broad and provocative range of material: maps and paintings depicting the geography and topography of sacred mountains; early symbolic images, most from the Warring States and Han-bronze vessels with pictorial designs, mirrors, censers, and hill jars; and Daoist images of Immortals' realms as seen in Ming and Qing paintings- holy sites, paradise fantasies both courtly and scholarly, the Peach Blossom Spring, gardens, mountains as a spiritual home, and so on. Some of Munakata's interpretations are controversial (and his taxonomy of the material is not entirely satisfying) but most, I think, will hold up well. A pioneering study will inevitably leave a number of important areas in the dark; in this case, omissions include the landscape painting of the Song dynasty, surely a great peak in the range of "sacred mountains" in art. Prime examples of the tenth and eleventh centuries would not have been available for the exhibition, but its almost complete neglect of Song painting leaves the study with a gap at its center. There's another big question about the periphery, the borders or limits of the subject. What mountains in Chinese art are not sacred? Munakata's discussion embraces garden painting, private villas and retreats, rock painting, the theme of "calling on a hermit" (mountains approached by wanderers seeking a transcendental experience), and so on; nor does he neglect rivers, seas, and level scenery that have sacred associations. We're getting close to talking about Chinese landscape painting in toto here. Such a view could be proposed, but not without direct and sustained argument. SUSAN E.
