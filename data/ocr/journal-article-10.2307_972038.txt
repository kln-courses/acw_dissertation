Freely copied and circulated at hieroglyphic workshops, Mathews' man- uscript has until now been inaccessible to the wider aca- demic public. This study set some of the standards of modern epigraphic reports, and while a great amount of work has been accomplished in Maya epigraphy over the last 10 years, some of it relevant to this study, the transla- tion remains true to the original in names, dates, events, and interpretation. The 374-page text includes some three dozen charts, 185 figures, anda 12-pagebibliography (notupdated, even in the case of papers cited as unpublished that have since seen publication). The charts and figures make this vol- ume an essential reference book for the sculpture of Yax- chilan. Charts inventory the monuments, compile dated events into dynastic historical records, assemble name and title phrases for rulers and other protagonists, summarize royal marriages and intersite visits, and record genealo- gies. Figures include site and regional maps, principal glyphs for chronology, events, names and titles, as well as analyzed hieroglyphic texts relating to the rulers discussed and a reconstruction of the political history of Yaxchilan and much of the Mayan region, by time period. Of equal importance to the scholar, the great majority of Yaxchilan's inscriptions also are presented as line drawings (by Ian Gra- ham and Eric vow Euw) in small-scale but very legible reproductions. The archaeological site of Yaxchilan has suffered little looting, although a few monuments have been removed to museums. Most texts were carved on the undersides of large, well-protected lintels, and the state of preservation is generally excellent. Texts are mostly of short to medium length, with an easy-to-read Classic for- malism that facilitates understanding. Of the site's 59 lin- tels, all but one is illustrated, but of the 35 stelae, only 19 are included. All 5 hieroglyphic stairs are illustrated and their difficult texts restored; an altar and a throne complete the illustrated monuments. Two early chapters trace the discovery and exploration of Yaxchilan and previous archaeological investigations. Two late chapters discuss the relation of the inscriptions to the architecture, and the nature of the Yaxchilan polity. In between, six chapters trace the known details of Early and Late Classic rulers and their reigns. Cross-referenc- ing dates and events from source to source, the text includes a detailed reconstruction of dynastic history, documenting genealogical and other associations between individuals. The association of hieroglyphic inscriptions with structures whose building sequences have been worked out by Math- ews and the Mexican archaeologist Roberto Garcia Moll facilitates historical inteipretation. In his final chapter, Mathews goes well beyond Yaxchilan itself to analyze intersite interactions across most of the Maya area. The discussion of the Yaxchilan polity through time includes detailed commentary on other scholars' works in this field, but clearly surpasses them in the reconstruction of polity divisions from the use of Emblem Glyphs and other data. The political reconstruction is one of the lasting contribu- tions of this study. Mathews himself was almost uniquely situated to be able to produce this landmark site report. Trained in archae- ology, he participated in the now legendary 1973 first Mesa Redonda de Palenque, where modern Maya epigraphy was forged. He later worked with Ian Graham on the Peabody Museum's Corpus of Maya Hieroglyphic Inscriptions pro- ject, and was supported during dissertation work by a MacArthur grant. During this period, he also did editorial work on the last manuscript of Tatiana Proskouriakoff, one of the giants of historical interpretation of the Maya. Failure to mention this manuscript, published posthu- mously in 1993 asMayaHistory, is acurious bibliographic lapse; its approach is reflected in Mathews' work as well as in that of most modern epigraphers, many of whom saw the text before publication, but it is rarely cited. In some way, Mathews' own thesis has played a similar role in its unpublished years, serving as the often unacknowledged model for numerous studies. Mathews made seminal con- tributions to the norms of modern Mayan epigraphy, including the personification of the previously anonymous Classic actors first with nicknames like Shield Jaguar and Lady Fist-Fish, then proceeding to phonetic readings of these same names (which Mathews has promoted else- where, but has not added to this text). Of equal importance, he has practiced his epigraphy in conjunction with archae- ology, and his long-term good relations with Mexican archaeologists gave him access to important material often left unconsidered. This is an excellent and finely detailed study of a single Classic Maya site, including interpreta- tions of the sculptured scenes and the hieroglyphic inscrip- tions that accompany them. Papers on the Madrid Codex. VICTORIA R. BRICKER and GABRIELLE VAIL, editors. Middle American Research Institute Publications Vol. 64.

This volume contains a useful set of studies of particular almanac series within the Madrid Codex. The product of a 1987 graduate seminar at Tulane University, it makes a significant contribution in providing extensive, integrated commentaries on these almanacs and serves as a much- needed reference work on this important Maya document. Many of the interpretations are speculative, but they are</page><page sequence="2">320 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 10, No. 3, 1999] acknowledged as such and published in the spirit of pro- voking further examination and discourse on this cryptic material. The authors are to be commended for venturing forward and attempting to analyze this document in a holis- tic manner through the consideration of groups of the- matically related almanacs. Images, glyphically-recorded actions, and dates are considered together as part of the entire package of information presented in each almanac. In addition to offering possible interpretations of the patterns observed in the almanacs, the authors also have compiled many tables of empirical data, including series of dates and lists of actions represented in the hiero- glyphic record. Systematic, page-by-page descriptions of these almanacs provided in the chapters by Christopher von Nagy, Gabrielle Vail, Cassandra Bill, and Donald Graff are useful commentaries that can be used by the reader as a translation and guide through sections of the codex. Bill, Graff and Victoria Bricker also rally new information to support the widely held view that the codex dates to the latter half of the Postclassic period (A.D. 100W1500). This date range is derived from sea- sonality data reflected on deer images combined with astronomical references and the chronology of ceramic vessels used in the codices. Although most of the information in this volume is highly specialized and fully understandable only to schol- ars familiar with Maya epigraphy, calendrics, and astron- omy, the chapters also present observations about ritual practice that are of interest to other Maya scholars. Bricker's introductory chapter provides a solid framework of information on Maya calendrics and the codices that will help uninitiated readers make sense of this material. Von Nagy and Bill discuss rituals of deer hunting and deer trapping represented in the images of the codices, and relate these to practices documented inYucatec ethnogra- phy and ethnohistory. Graff's treatment of the manufac- ture of ceramic vessels within the codices is interesting, although it is primarily geared toward assessing the chronology of these vessels. He suggests that some of the anthropomorphic figures who stand in front of ceramic ves- sels may be analogous to the Chen Mul style Postclassic effigy censers that are commonly found archaeologically. Specific chapters of the volume cover a range of top- ics. Bricker's introduction describes aspects of the tzolkin and haab calendrical stations; burner ceremonies; astro- nomical markers for the tropical year; the layout, reading order, and structure of the almanacs; and includes a dis- cussion of gods and people in the images of the Madrid Codex. In chapter 2, Von Nagy describes almanacs that pertain to deer hunting and deer trapping, and attempts to organize these into calendrical, iconographic, or textually related groups. Vail elaborates on this theme in chapter 3, which specifically examines deer trapping almanacs in relation to astronomical events associated with Scorpio and Virgo. She suggests a possible identification of deer in celestial positions in the codex as the constellation Virgo. Astronomical data and seasonal data gleaned from deer imagery lead Vail to propose that deer-trapping almanacs refer to rituals occurring in the spring (February to May) and scorpion almanacs refer to rituals occurring in late May. In chapter 4, Bill explores almanacs that portray God M. She notes that the themes of hunting and warfare are associated with this deity in addition to its more tradi- tionally accepted role as a merchant deity, although these roles are not mutually exclusive. Graff (chapter 5) uses cal- endric and iconographic information to propose that one section of the codex was used in the fifteenth century. He also provides additional useful descriptions of almanacs within this section. The concluding chapter by Bricker proposes that a central calendar-round almanac in this codex was an index to the entire document. The diversity of the activities portrayed in the almanac and its encom- passing calendrical structure suggest to Bricker that it was intended to serve as a key to the codex's organization, and she describes specific links between this central section and other sections of the manuscript. Papers on the Madrid Codex is an important reference for understanding this difficult indigenous document. The authors extract fresh insights on Postclassic Maya cos- mology, calendrics, ritual practice, and subsistence cycles from the texts and images of the Madrid Codex. This vol- ume will be pivotal for future work on this codex and stud- ies of Postclassic Maya ritual. Arqueoictiofauna mexicana. OSCAR J. POLACO and ANA FABIOLA GUZMAN. Coleccion Cientdica, Vol. 352.

Zooarchaeology and environmental archaeology have reached an important stage in the process of archaeologi- cal globalization. Study of the complex relationship between ancient peoples and their environments requires a broad comparative database, yet the compilation of such information is hindered by the variable availability of lit- erature from different study areas. This is particularly true in the Americas, where the database for research carried out in North America far surpasses that available in Cen- tral and South America. Much of the archaeological research in Latin America has been done by foreign insti- tutions, whichfurtherhampers comparative analysis; pub- lications from within the region are not accessible to the wider audience, while foreign publications are often not available to local archaeologists.</page></plain_text>
