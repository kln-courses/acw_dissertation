<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 2. ‘Reification’ between Autonomy and  Authenticity : Adorno on Musical  Experience1 Samir Gandesha In an aphorism entitled ‘Le Prix de Progress’, appended to Dialectic of  Enlightenment, Horkheimer and Adorno write that ‘Alle Verdinglichung  ist ein Vergessen’ (All reif ication is a forgetting) (Horkheimer and Adorno,  2008, p. 229, translation altered).2 This comes as the very last sentence of  a reading of a letter by Pierre Flourens, a French physiologist, who was  elected to the Académie Française in preference to Victor Hugo. A ground- breaking anaesthesiologist, Flourens raised serious concerns about the use  of chloroform in surgery because the substance didn’t simply inure the body  to pain but, rather, consigned it to oblivion. In other words, chloroform led  to a forgetting of suffering. This notion that ‘all reif ication is a forgetting’  is an appropriate point of departure for our discussion of what comprises  ‘reif ication’ or Verdinglichung (literally: ‘thingif ication’). The reason for this  is that it enables us to bring into view two exemplary ‘models’ that frame  the problem of reif ication specif ically as a form of forgetting: these are the  models of dialectic, on the one hand, and difference, on the other. The f irst stems from the Idealist tradition and, via a detour through  Feuerbach’s ‘transformative critique’ of religion, Marx’s analysis of the com- modity form in the famous fourth section of the f irst chapter of Capital,  Volume I. It is developed further in Georg Lukács’s epochal essay ‘Reification  and the Consciousness of the Proletariat’ published as a chapter of his  1923 book History and Class Consciousness. It could be said to culminate,  mediated by the experiences of the mid-twentieth-century artistic avant- garde, in Guy Debord’s The Society of the Spectacle. If, for Marx, capitalist  society in its liberal phase presents itself as an ‘immense accumulation of  commodities’, then for Debord, in late capitalism, ‘the whole life of those  societies in which modern conditions of production prevail presents itself  as an immense accumulation of spectacles’ (Debord, 1995, p. 12). The second model of reif ication has its origins in the existential theology  of Søren Kierkegaard and is given its fullest articulation in the phenom- enological ontology of Martin Heidegger as outlined in his early magnum  opus Being and Time published just four years after History and Class  </page> <page sequence="2"> 38 THe SPell oF CaPiTal  Consciousness, which introduces the idea of the ‘ontological difference’.  This is difference between the situated, f inite human being, Dasein, and  the things that are disclosed in and through Dasein’s concernful activity  in the context of the sedimented meanings constitutive of the world into  which he or she is ‘thrown’ (Heidegger, 1962, pp. 91–148). The tradition of  Western metaphysics is characterized by a constitutive ‘forgetting’ of the  ontological difference or what Heidegger calls Seinsvergessenheit. The two concepts are not unrelated, as Lucien Goldmann has suggested,  drawing attention to Heidegger’s reference in the f irst chapter of Part I to  the failure of the attempt to ground an account of reif ication in terms of  ‘consciousness’. Heidegger (1962, p. 487) states that ‘It has long been known  that ancient ontology works with “Thing-concepts” and that there is a  danger of “reifying consciousness”’. He then goes on to dismiss the formula- tion because it does not go deeply enough in the direction of ontological  questioning, stating ‘can we even seek that answer as long as the question  of the meaning of Being remains unformulated and unclarif ied’ (p. 487).  While Lukács isn’t named directly, he is clearly implied. So, in Goldmann’s  view (2009), Heidegger seeks in Being and Time to articulate nothing less  than an ontological response to History and Class Consciousness.3 In  particular, Heidegger’s account of ‘care’ (Sorge), according to Goldmann,  insofar as it unif ies past, present, and future, constitutes a response to  Lukács’s conception of totality as the historically mediated identity of  subject and object. The dispute between these two models and respective normative orienta- tions has been at the heart of the key debates within late-twentieth-century  social and political thought.4 It is my contention that the enduring impor- tance of Adorno’s critique of reif ication has to do, inter alia, with the way in  which brings both models into a ‘f ield of force’ throughout his writings, but  particularly through his understanding of the philosophical signif icance of  the autonomous artwork. It is by virtue of its autonomy that the artwork is  able to maintain the possibility of an experience of the dynamic, temporal  nature of the non-identical. In other words, in aesthetic experience Adorno  locates an immanent path beyond reif ication can be surpassed by a certain  form of ‘totalization’ that avoids both the collective action instigated by the  revolutionary party and the resoluteness of individual decision oriented  towards a project that would unify past, present, and future. Far from be- ing an impotent retreat from politics, as the Habermasian reading holds,  Adorno’s understanding of the aesthetic can be understood as a profound  contribution to thinking about some of the key preconditions of political  praxis (Gandesha, 2012). </page> <page sequence="3"> ‘ReiFiCaTion’ beT ween auTonomY and auTHenTiCiT Y 39 On the one hand, Adorno shows, with Horkheimer, the way in which the  ego’s struggle for self-preservation, paradoxically, seals the conditions of its  own demise. Self-preservation reif ies, and therefore destroys, the very life it  putatively seeks to preserve. This is a thesis that obviously takes on urgent  new meaning in the context of discussions of the ‘Anthropocene’.5 On the  other hand, the orientation towards an ‘authentic’ life in the work of Buber,  Jaspers, and especially the early Heidegger, amounts to what Adorno calls  a ‘reif ied critique of reif ication’ (Adorno, 1973a).6 For Adorno, it is in the  autonomous work of art that the logic of reif ication is pushed to extremes  and in such a way that opens up a relation to the non-identical or transitory  phenomena. Music, in particular, plays this role insofar as time itself is  its very medium. Like Penelope, who undoes by night the weaving she  performs by day, the artwork both actively participates in its alienation  from life and, by virtue of that very separation, is a spur to reflection on the  conditions of precisely such separation. Hence, as Horkheimer and Adorno  suggest, quoting Wagner: ‘Only the spear that wields the sword can heal the  wound’. In what follows, I go on to sketch out the two models in Lukács and  Heidegger in more detail (1), draw out the implicit normative dimensions  of these models (2), and then look at the way the respective normative  dimensions of each conception could be said to f ind an echo in Adorno’s  understanding of musical experience (3). 1. Two Models of Reification Returning to our two models—dialectic and difference—both could be  said to take their point of departure from the understanding of reif ication  as a form of forgetting that explicitly or implicitly also relates to attendant  processes of ‘fetishism’ and ‘alienation’.7 For the dialectical model, reif ica- tion is to be understood as Spirit’s objectifying activity that is forgotten as  such, that is, as activity, but which is then subsequently re-appropriated on  its return itself via the transition from consciousness to self-consciousness.  Remembering, here, is to be understood as not the simple the opposite  of forgetting, but rather as a process of a totalizing re-internalization  (Erinnerung) of that which had been externalized, forgotten as such and  mistaken for an ‘otherness’ or form of alterity standing over and against  its creator or author like an ‘alien power’. In this, the concept of experience  (Erfahrung), plays a key role and experience implies a journey or pathway  through which the shapes of consciousness are traversed. As Hegel puts it  in the ‘Preface’ to the Phenomenology of Spirit: </page> <page sequence="4"> 40 THe SPell oF CaPiTal  The Science of this pathway is the Science of the experience which con- sciousness goes through; the substance and its movement are viewed  as the object of consciousness. Consciousness knows and comprehends  only what falls within its experience; for what is contained in this is noth- ing but spiritual substance, and this, too, as object of the self. But Spirit  becomes object because it is just this movement of becoming an other to  itself, i.e. becoming an object to itself and of suspending this otherness.  And experience is the name we give to just this movement, in which the  immediate, the unexperienced, i.e. the abstract, whether it be of sensuous  [but still unsensed] being, or only thought of as simple, becomes alienated  from itself and then returns to itself from this alienation, and is only then  revealed for the f irst time in its actuality and truth, just as it then has  become a property of consciousness also. (1977, §36) Experience, then, is a re-membering or putting back in relation or media- tion a broken totality, whose individual parts had been severed or dis- membered. Hegel’s famous example is ‘sense certainty’ which inaugurates  the passage through the appearance of the various ‘shapes of conscious- ness’ in the Phenomenology. For Marx, the analogue is the commodity  form8 which, insofar as it is a fetish, that is, necessarily abstracted from  the conditions under which it is produced, it acquires what Marx calls a  ‘phantom-like objectivity’. It is, in other words, an object that occludes  the very social relations that it embodies which, therefore, gives it its  ‘phantom-like’ appearance. Such a ghostly objectivity constitutes a world  in which relations between human beings take on the character of rela- tions between things, and relations between things appear as relations  between human beings. In describing the commodity in a manner that  evokes his early critique of religion—the very f irst premise of criticism  per se—Marx describes the commodity form as abounding in ‘metaphysi- cal subtleties’ (metaphysische Spitzfindigkeit) and ‘theological niceties’  (theologische Mucken). Marx is already intimating something that Lukács  will subsequently elaborate into startling meta-philosophical claims  (see Feenberg, 2014), namely: that the commodity poses not just a socio- economic problem but also fundamentally a cognitive one. Reif ication,  then, in this tradition stems from the socially necessary illusion of the  commodity as a ‘real abstraction’, which then, itself, occludes the grasp of  the structural totality of social whole as the object not just of theory but  praxis. Forgetting here is to be understood specif ically as the structural  incapacity to grasp the historical formation of the social world through  practical activity.9 </page> <page sequence="5"> ‘ReiFiCaTion’ beT ween auTonomY and auTHenTiCiT Y 41 Lukács shows the manner in which the process of fetishism extends  from production relations and comes to penetrate qua a totalizing process  of rationalization or the elaboration of a system of formal procedures even  the most minute sphere of society, including the realm of intimacy.10 One  could say that the logic of commodity fetishism, in Lukács’s account, leads  to the fetishism of formal logic insofar as it gives rise to apparently insoluble  antinomies in philosophical thinking as in Kantian Critical Philosophy and  the German Idealism that constitutes a response to it. It is only in Hegel’s  notion of the Absolute, according to Lukács, do we f ind the best attempt  to cancel while simultaneously preserving these supposedly intractable  oppositions. In other words, the basic problem of reif ication—that hu- man relations take on the appearance of relations between things—deeply  penetrates even the most otiose realm of speculative philosophy. Hegel’s  notion of the ‘Homecoming of Spirit’, culminating in the rationality of  the ethical life of the modern state—the grasping of the rational content  of historically produced customs or Sitten—is a false, merely one-sided  solution to the problem of ‘transcendental homelessness’ (Lukács, 1971b  p. 41) because its perpetuates a merely passive or ‘contemplative’ relation  to the world. In Lukács’s view, it was only in the world-constituting activity  of the identical subject-object of history, that the intractable antinomies  of bourgeois thinking would be decisively transcended. Such an ‘identical  subject-object of history’ (Lukács, 1971a, p. 197) is able to grasp the totality of  historical objectif ications as the once-forgotten products of its own practical  activity. It is precisely towards such a conception of philosophy that the philoso- phy of difference takes as its critical point of departure. Heidegger argues  at the end of Division I of Being and Time that, while Hegel is one of the f irst  (Kant being the other) to recognize the distinctive nature of temporality,  in the f inal instance, he conceives of Spirit through ‘Kenosis’. Kenosis is the  theological term that denotes the process by which God empties Himself into  and ultimately out of time; the dialectic as self-described ‘theodicy’. So, in  Heidegger’s view, while Hegel arrives at the brink of a break with the philo- sophical tradition’s ‘onto-theological’11 conception of being as the antithesis  of time, he ultimately pulls back from it and re-inscribes the understanding  of being as enduring presence as the unconscious hypostatization of a  particular modality of time: namely, that of the present. Therefore, in Heidegger’s view, Hegel fails to go far enough insofar as he  fails to grasp the temporality of Being (Sein) itself. And the reason why Hegel  was incapable of grasping Being in this way had to do with the fact that,  like the tradition of Western metaphysics originating with Plato’s account  </page> <page sequence="6"> 42 THe SPell oF CaPiTal  of eidos, he failed to take as is starting point the ‘ontological difference’ or  the difference between Being (Sein) and beings (Seiendes). In other words,  the dialectical model of remembering, or making whole through the unfold- ing of its speculative drive towards freedom, cannot avoid a certain kind  of forgetting (Seinsvergessenheit)—the forgetting of the f inite, situated,  indeed, thrown (geworfen) being, Dasein. Indeed, it is precisely because he  or she is so thrown, that ‘Being’ becomes, itself, a question for the situated  human being. Hegel suggests, for example, that Spirit is able to remain  self-identical through the most extreme experiences including death: ‘[T]he  life of Spirit is not the life that shrinks from death and keeps itself untouched  by devastation, but rather the life that endures it and maintains itself in it. It  wins its truth only when, in utter dismemberment, it f inds itself’ (1977, §32). Spirit, on its speculative journey ‘home’ to itself, entailing the achieved  ‘identity of identity and non-identity’, the unity of ‘subject and substance’,  both cancels and preserves f initude itself. As a result, it fails to fully ac- knowledge the difference between Being or Dasein and beings, things that  are disclosed within the so-called ‘worldhood’ of Dasein’s world. In contrast  to the Hegelian Heimkehr or ‘Homecoming’, Heidegger understands Dasein  as literally Unheimlich or uncanny.12 It is in this idea of Seinsvergessenheit or  the ‘forgetting of being’ that we f ind an alternative, ontological, conception  of reif ication—a phenomenon that Heidegger locates at the heart of the  philosophical tradition stretching back to Plato’s theory of the forms. Here  Being is understood as enduring presence and therefore as the antithesis  of lived time as it unfolds between, to use Arendt’s terms, ‘natality’ and  ‘mortality’ (Arendt, 1958). As Heidegger suggests in direct opposition to  Hegel’s attempt to grasp ‘substance as subject’: ‘man’s “substance” is not  spirit as a synthesis of soul and body; it is rather existence’ (1962, p. 153). For Heidegger, the problem of ‘reif ication’ cannot be understood in  terms of the concept of consciousness precisely because of its Cartesian  starting point, that is the split between subject and object which, as previ- ously suggested, can itself be traced back to the Greeks. The dualism of  subject and object was part and parcel of Seinsvergessenheit that elided the  ontological difference and reduced the distinctive understanding of time  for human being-in-the-world to a merely vorhanden, ‘enduring presence’  that somehow withstood time. In contrast, Heidegger argues that Dasein  had to be understood in terms of what he called Sorge or care in which the  various modalities of time, namely: past, present, and future were unif ied  in a concernful engagement within the world. Such an account of temporality Heidegger famously explicated via the  example of the tool: That in the typical engagement within the totality  </page> <page sequence="7"> ‘ReiFiCaTion’ beT ween auTonomY and auTHenTiCiT Y 43 of meaningful structures constitutive of the world, the artisan does not  thematize the tool; it is merely an extension of his own body in undertaking  a particular future-directed project. It is, in other words, to be understood,  as something Zuhanden or ready-to-hand. It is only when the tool breaks  down does it become, in a sense, a ‘fetish’, though Heidegger does not of  course use the term, insofar as it is transformed from the ready-to-hand,  an integral part of Dasein’s world, to something that is ‘de-worlded’, torn,  violently we could say, from the web of meaningful relations constitutive  of the world and rendered as Vorhanden ‘present-at-hand’. The object can be  considered, in this sense, as ‘alienated’ from the Dasein’s own activity. What  are the specifically normative dimensions of these two models of reification? 2. Reification and Normativity To gain a perspective on the normative dimensions of these two models, it is  useful to compare Lukács and Heidegger’s conceptions with Axel Honneth’s  recent attempt, via a post-metaphysical13 reconstruction of the concept  of recognition, to revive and resuscitate the concept of reif ication. To the  idea with which I began the chapter, that ‘all reif ication is a forgetting’,  Honneth adds Stanley Cavell’s notion that knowledge is grounded in a prior  moment of acknowledgement. The reif ication or thingification of the person  results from a failure or a breakdown in the empathetic acknowledgment  of the other and opens the possibility of subsuming the person beneath  the category of ‘thing’.14 Honneth states that ‘[t]o the extent to which in our  acts of cognition we lose sight of the fact that these acts owe their existence  to our having taken up an antecedent recognitional stance, we develop a  tendency to perceive other persons as mere sensate objects’ (Honneth, 2008,  p. 57). Unlike in his other writings where recognition is understood roughly  according to the Hegelian differentiation of ‘Objective Spirit’ into spheres of  intimacy, civil society, and community, here Honneth seems to suggest that  the phenomenon of reif ication can be understood simply at the level of the  individual and therefore as a matter of subjective disposition that can be  simply corrected by a rather voluntaristic change of perspective. In other  words, reif ication, in Honneth’s ethical account the phenomenon,15 appears  then to be something like a category mistake and can be rectif ied as such. In contrast, as we have seen, Lukács and Heidegger understand reif ica- tion as a form of forgetting that results from a determinate structural crisis  that has profound implications for the conditions of human action. For  Lukács, reif ication constitutes the ongoing crisis of generalized commodity  </page> <page sequence="8"> 44 THe SPell oF CaPiTal  production through which the rationalization of even the most minute  aspect of the social whole comes about. Reif ication consists of the reduc- tion of time to space; of diachrony to ostensibly immutable synchronic  laws of social motion. This amounts, as I have already suggested, to a kind  of cognitive crisis that cannot, however, be solved by purely cognitive or  contemplative means but must ultimately be addressed through praxis.  Lukács could be said to be in agreement with the later Wittgenstein that the  problem of ‘reif ication’ (like that of scepticism) is not so much a philosophi- cal problem that could be met with a philosophical solution but rather a  meta-philosophical problem to be dissolved by way of self-conscious action  or praxis. For Heidegger, in contrast, reif ication arises as result of the crisis or  breakdown of our future-oriented, purposive action against the meaningful  horizon of worldly commitments and engagements. In other words, reif ica- tion results from the manner in which action is arrested or halted as a result  of a tear in the background horizon of the meaningful world provoked by  a breakdown in the zuhanden (ready-to-hand) character of things, that  is, the tool, itself, which is now disclosed as Vorhanden (present-at-hand);  Dasein’s thrownness into the world of pre-given meanings now is resolved  into a bifurcated scene consisting of a deracinated subject passively survey- ing an object as it appears directly before it on the horizon of an eternal  present shorn of any kind of relation to past or future. Like Wittgenstein, the  sceptical problem of the certainty of our knowledge claims and, relatedly,  the problem of the existence of other minds, is a function of a crisis or  breakdown of worldly relations as previously described. However wanting Honneth’s account of the origins of reif ication may  be, insofar as it provides no compelling structural account of reif ication, it  does provide a clear account of its normative orientation to the mutuality  of recognition between persons.16 If structural accounts are on offer in  an account of post-liberal capitalism in Lukács or in the account of the  Seinsvergessenheit at the heart of the tradition of Western metaphysics,  for Heidegger, their respective normative starting points are more or less  implicit rather than explicitly stated. For Honneth, reif ication stems, as  we have seen, from a misrecognition of the person; from a denial of the  recognition of the other’s aspiration to self-realization. In the case of Lukács  and Heidegger it is possible discern the way in which normative commit- ments are embedded in, on the one hand, the former’s account of history,  and, on the other hand, in the latter’s history of Western metaphysics as  a narrative of decline culminating, in his later writings, in the essence of  technological thinking. </page> <page sequence="9"> ‘ReiFiCaTion’ beT ween auTonomY and auTHenTiCiT Y 45 The f irst account of reif ication, the dialectical account, one could argue,  is oriented at recovering a form of lost autonomy understood not just in  terms of Kantian primacy of moral self-legislation but in political terms as  the democratic self-determination of a community.17 In taking up a merely  contemplative attitude to its own objectif ications, the collective subject  subordinates itself to a condition of heteronomy or of being determined by  an ‘alien power’.18 The overcoming of such an attitude, the transformation  of the petrif ied and barely recognizable forms of social existence is an act  of freedom or, at least, inaugurates the passage from the realm of necessity  to that freedom.19 The second account of reif ication, what I’m calling the difference ac- count, in contrast, understands the phenomenon as the reduction of the  human being to a condition indistinguishable from a world of things on  the temporal horizon of an eternalized present. This amounts not so much  to the loss of rational, which is to say self-legislating, freedom as it does a  loss of authenticity (Eigentlichkeit).20 Such a loss amounts to a falling into  the idle chatter (das Rede) of the anonymous world of ‘publicness’ by which  ‘everything gets obscured, and what has been covered up gets passed off  as something familiar and accessible to everyone’ (Heidegger, 1962, p. 165).  The light of the open public sphere darkens everything because it induces  Dasein to lose sight of, or indeed actively avoid, the fundamental questions  of human existence. These two models of reif ication—dialectic and difference—can be  seen, as alluded to above, to f ind their way into the key philosophical  positions of the late twentieth century. Each of these models, moreover,  is oriented by a specif ic account of normativity. The f irst is geared to a  notion of autonomy or a life that is a rationally self-legislating one. The  second is oriented towards realization of a life characterized by irreduc- ible difference or singularity. Autonomy entails action oriented towards  the collective subject’s self-appropriation of the objective forms of its own  activity. Authenticity, in contrast, is grounded in the irreducibly temporal  nature of Dasein, its f initude and ultimate orientation towards its ownmost  possibility, namely death. Being-towards-death is radically individuating  insofar as only I can face my own death. Such singularity ultimately trumps  the universality of moral law. Insofar as the origins of the idea of autonomy in Kant entails the public  use of reason, the problem of reif ication does not entail, therefore, in Hei- degger’s view, the transgression of the injunction to treat fellow rational  beings always as ends and never as means. Rather, in a manner that recalls  Kierkegaard’s idea of a ‘teleological suspension of the ethical’, authenticity  </page> <page sequence="10"> 46 THe SPell oF CaPiTal  consists in the irreducible singularity of the individual. Kierkegaard presents,  in Fear and Trembling, an inversion of Hegel’s account of the mediations  of individuality, particularity and universality within the unfolding of  Absolute Spirit: ‘faith’s paradox is this, that the single individual is higher  than the universal, that the single individual [...] determines his relation  to the universal through his relation to the absolute, not his relation to the  absolute through the relation to the universal’ (1985, pp. 97–98). It entails  what Derrida (2005, p. 36), referring explicitly to Kierkegaard, calls the  ultimately ungroundable ‘madness of decision’. Hence, for Heidegger, the  falling of Dasein into Das Man (the they), which is, as he suggests, always  already one of its possibilities, is an avoidance of or f light from its ‘own- most possibility’: Being-towards-death (Sein-zum-Tode). In other words,  for Dasein, Being-towards-death has a radically individuating function  and grounds its irreducible singularity in a manner that runs parallel to  Kierkegaard’s notion of faith. The claim that I wish to make here is that, in his conceptualization of the  phenomenon of reif ication, Adorno draws upon both of these normative  insights. On the one hand, in Dialectic of Enlightenment, his lectures on  moral philosophy (2002) and the section entitled ‘Models of Freedom in  Negative Dialectics’ (2007, pp. 211–299), Adorno is at considerable pains to  show the manner in which an account of radical autonomy, under which  he subsumes Lukács’s Fichtean critique of reif ication, is self-undermining.  That is to say, it entails, in its account of rational self-legislation, a repres- sive relation to the subject’s own sensuous impulses for fulf ilment and  happiness. Hence, it becomes the locus of the dialectic of enlightenment:  that the drive to self-preservation undermines the very (sensuous) life it is  meant to preserve in the f irst place. If detached from the ‘object’ (somatic  drives, external nature and the social order), autonomy, Adorno argues,  must reverse into its opposite: heteronomy.21 On the other hand, as I have shown elsewhere (Gandesha, 2004),  Adorno criticizes Heidegger’s account of reif ication as, itself, ‘reif ied’. That  is, Heidegger relies upon a form of what Günther Anders calls ‘pseudo con- creteness’ (1948) that substantializes historically generated and therefore  contingent conditions, for example the emotional states (Befindlichkeiten)  of Dasein. It is precisely because of Heidegger’s ontico-ontological difference  that he is unable to root an account of reif ication in natural-historical  processes (Gandesha, 2004).22 At the same time, the notion of authenticity  can be understood as a placeholder for the non-identical or the ‘transitory’  that always already lies beyond the grasp of the concept. In late capitalist  society in which the logic of reif ication had penetrated deeply into the  </page> <page sequence="11"> ‘ReiFiCaTion’ beT ween auTonomY and auTHenTiCiT Y 47 most intimate spheres, the transitory becomes a key site for resistance. The  relation to the transient is also a new form of normativity grounded in non- identity, which suggests a non-subsumptive and therefore non-dominating  relation between the individual and the collective. For Adorno, such a form  of normativity was embodied in exemplary fashion in musical experience,  which from the beginning of the Western tradition of political philosophy  in Plato’s middle period dialogues, the Republic in particular, is inextricable  from the question of justice.23 While this interpretation cannot be fully  elaborated in this context, I would like to try to sketch out in the following  and concluding section the way in which auditory experience provides the  basis for a non-repressive form of totalization that both borrows from the  two models previously discussed and, in the process, goes beyond them. 3. Musical Experience beyond Autonomy and Authenticity As I have previously suggested the two most signif icant models of rei- f ication in the twentieth century, those of Lukács and Heidegger, are  oriented by two distinct forms of normativity grounded in autonomy and  authenticity respectively. What I want to suggest in this section is the  way in which Adorno’s approach places autonomy and authenticity in a  Kraftfeld or f ield of force. Central to the development of Adorno’s position,  of course, is his relation to Walter Benjamin. Benjamin’s early conception  of allegory in his work on Trauerspiel or German mourning play is key,  along with Lukács’s conception of ‘second nature’, to Adorno’s elaboration  of the idea of ‘natural-history’ which then forms the basis not only for the  argument of Dialectic of Enlightenment, which lays bare the inextricable  relation of enlightenment and myth, but also for the arguments of Negative  Dialectics, many of which are centrally concerned to show the propensity  of an account of pure practical reason geared to self-legislating autonomy  to collapse under its own (rigoristic) weight. While, in Adorno’s view,  the concept of autonomy must be defended (see, for example, Adorno  and Becker, 1983), this can only be done by way of a seemingly aporetic  receptivity to the other or the non-identical (and hence heteronomy). The  aporia is only apparent, however, insofar as the supplement of aesthetic  experience is the key mediation between ‘autonomy’ and ‘authenticity,’  universal concepts of reason and sensuous particularity. Specif ically in  relation to musical experience, understood temporally, the non-identical  is a form of transience ruptures the immanence of identity-thinking and  identifying processes from within. </page> <page sequence="12"> 48 THe SPell oF CaPiTal  But Benjamin’s later, Brecht-inspired work, also serves as a critical foil for  Adorno’s attempt to articulate a critique of what he (Horkheimer) calls the  ‘culture industry’. As they argue in Dialectic of Enlightenment, enlighten- ment culminates in ‘mass deception’ in which the anthropomorphism of  its categories reaches new heights. An earlier version of this critique of  the culture industry appears in an essay published in the Zeitschrift für  Sozialforschung entitled ‘Fetish Character of Music and the Regression of  Listening’ (Adorno, 1982). Here, Adorno offers an almost explicit refutation  of Benjamin’s widely influential essay ‘The Work of Art in the Age of Its  Mechanical Reproducibility’. As the central claims of this essay have already  been discussed ad nauseam, I won’t rehearse them again here. Suff ice it to  say, however, that the thrust of Benjamin’s argument is that the destruction  of the ‘aura’ or authenticity of the artwork via technologies of mass reproduc- ibility, photography, and f ilm, in particular, afford new opportunities for  the objective presentation of socio-historical truths that had hitherto not  been available to art—an ‘optical unconscious’ in which hitherto concealed  structures of power are brought to light—and new subjective conditions  for the experience of art. For example, the collective experience of f ilm  supplants the individualized bourgeois forms of apprehension of art works  in the museum. Of a piece with his scepticism of much of his older friend and mentor’s  later work, Adorno seeks to make an immanent critique of Benjamin’s cul- tural criticism. For example, in his exchange over the essay on Baudelaire,  Adorno suggests that Benjamin doesn’t properly understand Marx’s concept  of ‘commodity fetishism’, and that he therefore ought to return to Capital,  Volume I. Similarly, in ‘Fetish Character’, Adorno grounds his response to  what he views as Benjamin’s excessively optimistic account of mass culture  not only in Marx’s account of commodity fetishism, which he quotes directly  and at some length, but also in Lukács’s account of reif ication which, as is  well-known, was also extremely highly regarded by Benjamin.24 Indeed,  in suggesting that reif ication culminates in the culture industry, Adorno  anticipates Debord’s account of the ‘spectacle’. Two points of intersection  are worth indicating: the utter passivity (pseudo-activity) of the spectator/ listener before the spectacle and the overwhelming reproduction of the  ‘Always-the-same’ (das Immergleiche). According to Adorno, ‘A sensory  pleasure turns into disgust as soon as it is seen how it only serves to betray  the consumer. The betrayal consists in always offering the same thing’  (Adorno, 1982, p. 290). However much it may seem that Adorno’s and Benjamin’s positions are  strictly opposed on the question of the emancipatory character of mass  </page> <page sequence="13"> ‘ReiFiCaTion’ beT ween auTonomY and auTHenTiCiT Y 49 culture, it is important to recognize that Adorno is clear that mass culture  and autonomous art, light and serious music, are, as he puts it ‘Both torn  halves of an integral freedom to which however they do not add up’ (Adorno,  1973b, 66; see also Leppert, 2005, pp. 92–133). Both high and low culture, in  other words, cannot escape the totalizing logic of commodity fetishism and  reif ication that suffuses capitalist society in its late phase. In articulating  his critique, Adorno’s concern is to challenge directly what he considers  Benjamin’s all-too sanguine assessment of the political possibilities that  attend modes of ‘distracted’ apperception exemplif ied by the cinema and  that crystallize the signif icance not just of epic theatre but also the Russian  avant-garde. In particular, Adorno’s concern is the connection between the  objective processes by which music, ‘serious’ and ‘light’ alike, is subjected to  the law of value, hence its ‘fetish character’, and the subjective process by  which the capacity to ‘listen’ to (and therefore properly experience, erfahren  rather than simply erleben) music is undermined. The fetish character of  music, in other words, generates an inherently reif ied form of listening. If  ‘all reif ication is a forgetting’, then reif ication in this specif ic case entails an  incapacity to hold the parts in an articulated relation with the whole in the  dynamic, temporal unfolding or movement (Goehr, 2008) of a musical work.  Genuine musical experience (Erfahrung) entails a capacity for Erinnernung,  which means the ability to reintegrate parts within the whole—literally, as  we saw in connection with Hegel, to ‘re-member’ what had been dirempted  or dis-membered. While regressive listening entails a certain kind of recall  whereby the leitmotif, for example, particularly in the late Romantic works  of Wagner, for example, function as anticipations of advertising jingles and  become instantly recognizable. Such leitmotifs, themselves, as forms of  disconnected forms of climactic experiences (Erlebnisse) entail a forgetting  or break in the structural relation to the whole. In this sense, if Benjamin’s  theses concerning f ilm are correct at all, they certainly cannot be extended  to music: ‘But if the f ilm as a whole seems to be apprehended in a distracted  manner, deconcentrated listening makes the perception of the whole impos- sible’ (Adorno, 1982, p. 288). Musical structure, therefore, helps to illuminate  ontological questions. Here it is possible to see the important links to both Lukács and Heidegger.  For the former, as we have seen, reif ication is closely tied to forgetting. For  Lukács, what is forgotten is the constitutive link to practical activity, the  objectif ications of which then confront the collective agent as an alien  power from without; a condition of utter alienation or heteronomy. For  Heidegger, reif ication understood is understood as the forgetting of the  ontico-ontological difference grounded in the qualitative temporality of the  </page> <page sequence="14"> 50 THe SPell oF CaPiTal  human being situated or thrown into an always already meaningful world.  As I have suggested above, in the f irst account what is at stake is autonomy,  in the second, authenticity. In Adorno’s account of musical experience  (Erfahrung), it is possible to discern the attempt to defend autonomy,  which is to say, aesthetic autonomy, whereby the work embodies its own  self-directed lawfulness, in such a way as to rescue a notion of aura or  authenticity understood as the trace of otherness that does not enter into  concepts without remainder. Yet this is a kind of authenticity (Eigentlichkeit)  distanced from property (Eigentum), as the temporal evanescence of music  cannot be possessed as such (see Leppert, 2005). That in the autonomous,  and therefore reified, artwork it is possible to discern a dialectical model for  a non-reif ied fluid relation of sensuous particularity and universality that  negates the logic of subsumption of the former beneath the latter. As Adorno  (1982, p. 298) suggests, ‘Even discipline can take over the expression of free  solidarity if freedom becomes its content. As little as regressive listening  is a symptom of progress in consciousness of freedom, it could suddenly  turn around if art, in unity with society, should ever leave the road of the  always-identical’. Specif ically with reference to the musical experience of what Adorno  calls ‘structural listening’,25 that rather than entailing a forgetting or elision  of the work as a whole punctuated by the shock-like, discrete, and discon- nected experiences (Erlebnisse) of individual moments, the autonomous  work calls forth a kind of concentrated listening as a type of experience  (Erfahrung) as a type of unfolding that works simultaneously backwards  and forwards; that what in a phenomenological register would be referred  to as ‘internal time consciousness’ and therefore involves a unifying process  entailing both retention and protention. However, and this is a key differ- ence from both Lukács and Heidegger, it would totalize in such a way as to  generate or regenerate a (mimetic) capacity for passive receptivity (rather  than active, constituting spontaneity) in relation to the genuinely other. It  is a form of totalization, in other words, that sets free the transitory rather  than subsuming it beneath subject-object identity (Lukács) or Dasein’s  care structure unifying past and present in the futurity of one’s own most  authentic (eigentlich) possibility (Heidegger). What Adorno calls ‘thinking  conceptually beyond the concept’ is in a sense then a form of remember- ing of the necessity of forgetting—that sensuous particularity can never  be subsumed beneath concepts without leaving a trace or a remainder  that is simply unrecuperable because of its inherent temporality; that, like  musical notes, the non-identical simply sounds and then and passes away.  As Adorno suggests in reference to the free atonal works of Schönberg and  </page> <page sequence="15"> ‘ReiFiCaTion’ beT ween auTonomY and auTHenTiCiT Y 51 Webern: ‘They are called individualists, and yet their work is nothing but a  single dialogue with the powers that destroy individuality—powers whose  “formless shadows” fall gigantically on their music. In music, too, collective  powers are liquidating an individuality past saving, but against them only  individuals are capable of representing the aims of collectivity’ (1982, p. 299). To return to Pierre Flourens’s rejection of the use of chloroform with  which I started, his reason for doing so had to do with the fact that, in  contrast to received opinion, chloroform not only fails to diminish suffering  in patients who are sedated with the drug, but actually enhances it. The  way chloroform acts, however, is to enable the nervous system to forget  what it has undergone. Moreover, given its effectiveness in promoting such  forgetfulness and therefore in widening the scope for increasing the inva- siveness of medical procedures, it risks turning human beings into guinea  pigs; in transforming every operation into an act of vivisection. Indeed, the  unprecedented levels of pain that might be caused by the invasive nature of  the procedures themselves may cause permanent mental damage or even  death under narcosis, the exact nature of which would be concealed from  both the relatives of the patient as well as the world at large. In a sense, this  kind of reif ication as a forgetting would be a double forgetting: a forgetting  of forgetting. A forgetting of a nature of the administering of chloroform  and its effects, i.e. not the reduction in the body’s sensitivity to stimuli but  rather enhancing its capacity to forget the pain that it has suffered. My argument has been that for Adorno, Lukács’s, and Heidegger’s  conceptions of reif ication ultimately fail to understand this problem of  the forgetting of the necessity of forgetting addressed by Flourens. In this  example, we see medicine as a rational system that treats the individual as  a thing (as a guinea pig to be experimented on) or a mere presence-at-hand  that forgets the authorship and/or irreducible singularity of the human  being. However, what is not brought to memory, and what to some extent  def ies its powers of recall, is an irreconcilable moment of somatic suffer- ing that pervades natural history. In contrast to Lukács and Heidegger,  Adorno seeks to differentiate a notion of enlightenment as Mündikeit from  the self-destructive notion of enlightenment as Aufklärung. While Kant  uses the two concepts more or less interchangeably in his famous essay  ‘Beantwortung der Frage: Was ist Aufklärung?’, Adorno (with Horkheimer)  differentiates the two. While Aufklärung, emphasizing the role of vision  in establishing a totalizing picture of the whole, ‘the fully enlightened  earth radiates disaster triumphant’ (Horkheimer and Adorno, 1988, p. 3),  Adorno takes Mündigkeit, to mean the capacity of the subject to speak up  for him- or herself in a non-conformist way and this entails a certain kind  </page> <page sequence="16"> 52 THe SPell oF CaPiTal  of danger and riskiness that comes with a refusal of ‘identif ication with the  aggressor’, one that in his youth Adorno (1991, p. 186) came to associate with  the use of Fremdwörter, which he understood as the ‘Jews of language’. Far  from simply emphasizing the autonomy of the subject and perpetuating the  self-destructive logic of the dialectic of enlightenment, however, Adorno  stresses the importance, indeed the irreducibility, of aspiring to ‘express  the inexpressible’. Indeed such irreducibility comes into its own precisely  by virtue of the specialized (and therefore reif ied) dialectic of aesthetic  autonomy that releases the transitory, the ‘unexpressable’, from the hold  of identity or the ‘expressable’. It is the resistance of the former that makes  possible what Hannah Arendt regards as the very signature of the political:  namely, the possibility of a ‘new beginning’. Bibliography Adorno, T.W.
