<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jean Hatchet and Charles the Bold A Surrealist Collage by Max Ernst An important Surrealist collage by Max Ernst (1891-1976), Jeanne Hachette et Charles le Temeraire (Jean Hatchet and Charles the Bold) orLe Jeune Prince (The Young Prince) (Figure 1), has recently been acquired by The Cleveland Museum of Art. Born in Briihl near Cologne, Ernst studied philosophy, psychi atry, and art history at the University of Bonn. Following World War I, he collaborated with Johannes Baargeld in forming the Dada Conspiracy of the Rhineland in Cologne-where they were joined by Jean Arp-before moving to Paris in 1922 where he .._ Figure 1.

Ernst was the most inventive artist among the early Surrealists, discovering and creating a myriad of new approaches to the creative act. His collages, however, certainly rank among his most successful works. In making them he reversed the central aims of the Cubist collagists. Where Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, or Juan Gris were primarily concerned with formal considerations when they created their Cubistpapiers colles during the years from 1912 to 1915 (Figure 2), Ernst was more concerned with images and the poignancy of their illogical relationships in his collages of the 1920s and 1930s. Picasso, Braque, Gris, and their Cubist colleagues cut shapes out of wallpaper, newspaper, and other ordinary materials which they fixed onto surfaces of drawings and paintings where they served as elements in their compositions. Ernst, on the other hand, used images from photographs and illustrations in books and journals-especially woodcuts and steel engravings-which he then juxtaposed in fantastic ways. His early collages such as The Gramineous Bicycle (Figure 3), done in the late 'teens and early 'twenties, arranged these elements on a neutral ground. In his later decoupages-collages, such as The Cleveland Museum of Art's new acquisition, he fixed the cut-out images to a finished and complete illustration, drastically altering not only its appear ance but its spirit. This process was presaged in certain collages done around 1920 when he made a practice of painting over parts of illustrations (Figure 4). Furthermore, while his earlier col lages were usually conceived as individual entities, his later ones were often elements in a series based on a theme. Between 1929 and 1934, for example, he did three Surrealist novels largely made up of collages. The earliest-La Femme 100 Tetes [The woman without one hundred heads], consisting of nearly 150 collages with an accompanying text and preface by Andre Breton2-was published the same year that the Museum's new collage was made. In 1930 Ernst created a second collage novel, Reve d'une petite fille qui voulut entrer Carmel [Dream of a little girl who wanted to be a Carmelite], and in 1934 he made a third, Une semaine de bonte ou Les sept elements capitaux [A week of goodness or the seven capital elements]. The collages created for these unusual books often exhibit black humor and a streak of sadism as they attack organized religion and middle-class morality. The Museum's recently acquired collage is one of four from an unrealized series called Morceaux choisis de I'histoire de France (Morsels [minor events] Chosen from the History of France). The other collages in this group are titled: L'esprit de</page><page sequence="3">Figure 3.

The images in the original engraving which serve as the basis for The Cleveland Museum's collage include a young man in Re naissance costume exploding upward out of a wooden bucket floating in a body of water before a castle. A full moon illumi nates a flock of distant birds in the night sky. To what is ap parently an illustration for a fairy tale, Ernst added the inverted image of a dolphin over the head and upper torso of the prince, thus giving him a monstrous bird-like appearance.3 The female figure in the wooden bucket and the beetle on the surface of the water are also elements supplied by Ernst. The bucket was cut along its edges by the artist, the figure of the woman inserted be hind it, and the cut sections pasted back down. The beetle covers the signature of the original illustrator, its legs and feeler being formed by parts of the letters left exposed. By placing a light be hind this area and using an infra-red viewer (Figure 8),4 one can discern the following letters and ink strokes. 276 It seems likely that Louis Mont6gut (born 1855), a French illu strator who did designs for La Chronique Parisienne, was the au thor of the illustration used by Ernst as the basis for this collage. Thus, an illustration, possibly for a fairy tale, has been trans formed into a fantastic scene with a title referring to an obscure incident from French history. Charles the Bold (1433-1477) was the last reigning duke of Burgundy. He came into opposition with Louis XI of France when he attempted to conquer Alsace, Lor raine, and other French territories in order to re-establish the kingdom of Lotharingia.5 In the battle for Beauvais, on 27 June 1472, as the Burgundian forces were about to overwhelm the 300 French defenders, a young woman, Jeanne (whose surname was Laisn6 or Fourquet) entered the battle armed with an axe. She hurled a Burgundian man-at-arms from the battlements, and tore down the Burgundian banner. Her act rallied the French garrison who then repelled the invaders. Thus, she is known to history as Jeanne Hachette (Jean Hatchet). This event, still commemorated</page><page sequence="5">FAR LEFT Figure 5. L'esprit de Locarno (The Spirit of Locarno).

During the 1860s Isidore Ducasse (Lecomte de Lautr6amont) had applied this device in verbal terms throughout his novel Les Chants de Maldoror, a work 277</page><page sequence="6">greatly admired by the Surrealists. The most famous example from this novel is the often quoted description of his English hero as being "fair ... as the chance meeting on a dissecting table of a sewing machine and an umbrella. "8 Frottage and grattage are two techniques that Ernst created, in addition to the Surrealist collage, in his attempts to free the un conscious and liberate the artist from his traditional servitude to time honored techniques of drawing, painting, composing, and all other a priori methods for organizing a work of art. Frottage refers to the practice of making rubbings (with pencil, crayon, paint, or other media) of such things as worn wooden floors, leaves, and other such irregular surfaces in order to stimulate the artist's imagination leading him to find and complete a multitude of fantastic images and scenes which he reads into the irregular patterns of the rubbing. Grattage refers to the technique of scrap ing away an already painted surface causing unexpected shapes, textures, and colors to be revealed, again, inspiring visions and fantasies which stimulate the artist to create. These methods, along with the Surrealist collage, emphasize the importance of the artist's imagination and instincts in organizing independent elements to form a homogeneous unit. By the same token, they de-emphasize acquired skills such as traditional techniques of drawing and painting. In short, they indicate that the quality of a work is finally determined by its effectiveness in stimulating a satisfying response in the observer (including the artist) regardless of the methods employed to achieve such a result. This is not to suggest that skill in the techniques of drawing or painting cannot be employed as means to a satisfying effect, only that the final work should not be judged solely on the basis of the technical skills which the artist employs to realize them. Ernst's Surrealist collage, Jeanne Hachette et Charles le Temeraire, is incongruous in detail but coherent in unity; it is a bizarre, fantastic, and altogether satisfying work of art. EDWARD B.

The translation of the title is the result of Ernst's punning with the French word for one hundred, cent, which is pronounced almost the same as sans, the word for without. 3. Ernst's propensity for visual as well as verbal puns is clear in the im age of the dolphin (Dauphin is the French title for the heir to the throne). Charles the Bold of Burgundy knew Louis XI of France when the latter was the Dauphin and Charles aspired to certain French territories. Fur ther, Ernst had long used the image of a bird as his own alter-ego. (This image is derived from an incident from his childhood.) In 1930 he in vented "Loplop, Superior of the Birds," an anthropomorphic bird which became an obsessional image in his work. 4. The lettering which appears in the photograph is from the verso of the page on which the illustration appears. Photographed with a Vidicon from an infra-red viewer and by placing a light behind the area. I am in debted to William Real, Mellon Fellow in the Conservation Department of The Cleveland Museum of Art, for his thoughtfulness and initiative in devising a method by which this signature could be read and photo graphed. 5. Lotharingia (Lothari regnum) was comprised of approximately the lands between the Rhine on the east and the Scheldt, Saone, and Rhone rivers on the west. This heterogeneous kingdom, stretching from Hol land to Provence and lying between the modern states of France and Germany, was assigned to Lothaire, son of Louis the Pious (AD 814-840) and grandson of Charlemagne, by the Treaty of Verdun in 843. 6.
