<plain_text><page sequence="1">47 An Investigation of a New Theory concerning the Bird-Man E. Douglas Van Buren - Rome Monsieur Amiet, in his very suggestive article (*), rejects the usual explanations of scenes in which the bird-man figures. He points out that in presargonid documents the bird-man was always pacific, and was often associated with the boat with prow in human form, which for the sake of convenience will here be termed the god-boat. Amiet opines that the bird-man could even be substituted for this anthropomorphic boat because in one example he has been thought to hold a steering-pole (Fig. 1) (2). In other examples the bird-man, like the god-boat, is shown carrying a three-branched bough and is accompanied by a man-headed lion, a plough, and a pot, the three attributes which usually appear in scenes representing the voyage. The earlier documents represent scenes of triumph according to Amiet, but in the Akkadian period a profound change occurs, and the bird-man is represented as being defeated, bound, and even slain. Thus the scenes fall into two groups like the wings of a diptych, scenes of triumph, and those of defeat. The cycle of the sun-god is comparable, for he, too, rose, increased in force, declined, and sank in winter into the gloom of the nether world. The bird-man was represented sometimes as a genie of vegetation, sometimes as an aco- lyte of the sun who, in that case, should be regarded as the great god of nature with whom the eagle also was associated to such an extent that " l'aigle était vraisemblablement symbolique, parfois, du dieu dont il était associé ". The cycle of the eagle, both natural and leontoce- phalous, was precisely the same, for he also triumphed with the solar (*) Pierre Amiet, L'homme- o i se au Jans Vart mésopotamien' Or 21, 1952, pp. 149-67.

Douglas Van Buren god and with him was defeated and declined. The bird-man was the hypostasis of the eagle because they both personified vegetation. This interesting theory has much to recommend it, and an inves- tigation of the arguments quickly reveals how much of value it has to teach us. It is undeniable that presargonid documents picture the bird-man as pacific, even if in one example he does contend with, or at least reverse a stag (*) ; and he seems to be connected with vegetation, although the only examples in which he can actually be seen to hold foliage are the Third Early Dynastic seal from Ur and two seals, one of the beginning, the other of the end of the Akkadian period, in the second of which his figure is duplicated (2). The identi- ty with the eagle seems more problematic. Amiet notes that the eagle, both natural and leontocephalous, was sometimes represented frontally with wings spread, at other times in profile with folded wings as if he had alighted. The seal previously mentioned, in which the stag figures, shows that the spread eagle and bird-man could both be represented in the same scene, and so does a seal impression from Farah (3), if Amiet is right in identifying as a bird-man the figure below the eagle. If they were identical this duplication in the same scene seems strange. There seems to be a slight confusion in dating the earliest examples. It is what is apparently the earliest example as yet known of the bird-man which should be dated in the Jemdet Nasr period (Fig. 2) (4); towards the end of that period among the designs painted on a " scarlet-ware " vase from Khafajah a chari- ot is depicted with a bird-man perched on the chariot-pole (6). The earliest representations of the eagle, natural or leontocephalous, do not belong to the " middle of the Early Dynastic epoch ", but go back beyond it to the time of Uruk IV (•).

The seal impression (Heinrich, Fara, Pl. 45, i; Amiet, Fig. 5) does not represent a bird- man, for the creature has hindlegs and forepaws, and seems intended for a bounding dog with bushy tail (Van Buren, Fauna [An Or 18, 1939], p. 16) (2) Ur Excav.

Douglas Van Buren Amiet has rightly called attention to the bird-man's connection with the god-boat, but instead of affirming on the evidence of two examples that the former was the equivalent of and could be substi- tuted for the latter, it is perhaps more prudent to say that details, sudi as the plough, the man-headed lion, and the pot, usually associ- ated with the god-boat, or more probably with the deity who thus voyaged, are twice found associated with the bird-man (Fig. 1) f1). Fully to appreciate the importance of Amiet 's observations the whole subject of the god-boat must be re-investigated (2). The germ of the motive is perhaps to be found in a scene where a god sits on a stool placed on the back of a dragon with an elongated serpentine body ending in a sharply upturned tail like the stern of a boat. The lion precedes the dragon, the plough is just above the dragon's head, the pot appears above a standing bird (Fig. 3) (8). The second stage may be illustrated by another seal which pictures a god, who seems to hold a flail used to thresh grain: he stands in a boat with a prow terminating in the head of a serpent.

The importance of this seal is twofold, for it proves that the snake-god was known even before the Akkadian era, and that theriomorphic boat, snake-god, and serpent were here regarded as three separate entities. The subject of the god-boat was first represented in the begin- ning of the Third Early Dynastic period, and was carried on into and through the Akkadian period, undergoing considerable alterations as that epoch proceeded. Many theories as to its meaning have been put forward, that advanced by Frankfort being the one most generally accepted (2). According to Frankfort the subject centers round a presargonid god of fertility, and represents the voyage of the sun- god across the sky. As to the significance of the voyage he offers three alternatives: a) a mythological view of the sun's daily journey through the sky; b) some belief in direct and intimate connection between the sun's actions and the success of man's agricultural la- bours: c) the passage of the sun during the night across the ocean of the nether world. Frankfort admits, however, that in the Early Dynastic period the sun-god does not figure in any other scene. This interpretation is accepted by Amiet without reserve, but is rejected by Kramer who believes that the subject illustrates a Nippur poem which relates the journey of Nannar to Nippur to visit Enlil (3). An objection to that opinion is that no example of the scene is known definitely to have come from Nippur. Moortgat considers that the god in the boat was the vegetation divinity Tammuz whose personal- ity was absorbed by Shamash in Akkadian times (4). Parrot objects that in early Sumerian representations there are no details to charac- terize the seated god as Shamash or any specific divinity; in the Akkad- ian period, on the contrary, the flames rising from his shoulders indi- cate that he is a solar god. Therefore as far as the earlier period is concerned Frankfort's identification of the god transported as Sha- mash is not fully proved; he may sometimes have been Shamash, f1) Allard Pierson Mus., Frankfort, JEOI.

Douglas Van Buren but not necessarily always, for he may have had another identity at another site. Consequently he suggests that the theme of the god- boat commemorated the " revelation " of the plough, the inaugur- ation on earth of agrarian civilization (1). All these interpretations of the theme have something to contribute. The identity of the god, however, is really of less importance than his nature, and all these authorities are in agreement in thinking that the scene illustrated a fertility myth and that the object of the voyage was to bestow or obtain fertility through the medium of the plough, of fertilizing wa- ters, fecundating sunshine, or in some other manner. Amiet states that the god-boat carries foliage to indicate that he was an agrarian god whose chthonian nature was adumbrated by his serpentine body. In support of that statement it may be added that the serpent itself often had a fertility connotation. It seems probable, however, that such fertility elements as the god-boat may have pos- sessed were acquired as the vehicle of transportation of a vegetation divinity. Nevertheless, with two doubtful exceptions (2), there does not seem to be any example in which the divine passenger holds ver- dure, and the god-boat does not do so " habitually ", but very rarely (Fig. 6) (*), for usually both his hands are fully occupied in wielding the steering-pole. Amieťs contention that the Akkadian snake-god was perhaps identified with the god-boat known from the presargonid era is com- pletely vindicated, for a passage which seems to elucidate the whole matter is to be found in the Eridu Hymn which describes the building of Enki's " house in the Abzu " (4). It relates the journey by boat of Enki to Nippur, and tells how (11. 80, 85-9) Enki, acclaimed by the fish of the sea, embarked: " Enki's rudder is Nirah (the snake-god), the young reeds are his steering-pole. When Enki embarks on his boat, then is the year full to overflowing (with abundance) ". The (*) André Parrot, Studia Mariana I, 1950, pp. 112-18.

The Eridu Hymn reveals that the god-boat was the snake-god Nirah; the divine passenger was Enki, god of living waters, who possessed other pronounced fertility characteristics; the object of the voyage was to ensure plentiful harvests and abundance of all kinds. This explanation may also indicate why the three attributes usually associated with the scene of the god-boat were appropriate : the significance of the plough is obvious, as Parrot has intimated; the pot may symbolize Enki's vase of ever-flowing, ferti- lizing waters; the meaning of the man-headed lion is more obscure, but the intention may have been to imply that the lion, who typified the fierce sun of midsummer, was tamed to the will of the god and held in check so that he should not desiccate with his burning rays the vegetation fostered with the help of the plough and the perpetu- ally flowing waters. Therefore in this myth it is Enki who plays the prominent part, just as he does so often in the story of the bird-man, and therein may lie the connection between the two conceptions. Owing to the rapidly increasing ascendency of Shamash in the Akkad- ian period many of the older myths were altered to adapt them to the cult of the sun-god. Thus the voyage to bestow fertility became the journey of the sun-god across the heavens or over the waters of the I^ower World. Changes appear in the Akkadian period not only in the myths but in the representations also. Twice the figure of the bird-man is duplicated, once in a scene depicting an assembly of gods when both of them hold maces, and again in an Akkadian ver- sion of the subiect of the god-boat (x). The god-boat himself be- comes increasingly anthropomorphized until finally he is pictured, the voyage accomplished, in the act of plunging his forked pole into the bank to serve as an anchor, and himself placing one foot on the ground to step ashore (2). Therefore Amiet is quite correct in saying that in that period a profound alteration occurred in the legend of the bird-man. He maintains that the change was manifested in the documents which show the bird-man at first triumphant with the sun-god, the conqueror of his adversary, and later vanquished, bound, and even slain, thus (i) Legrain, PBS XIV, Pis.

Douglas Van Buren illustrating the whole mythological cycle of the bird-man who person- ified vegetation in its spring vigour, favoured by gentle showers of rain and by the spring sun, simultaneously with whom he increased in strength to a triumphant climax. But then came the reversal of for- tune, for the vegetation, cut down at harvest by men and burnt up by the ardent sun of summer, withered and perished, sinking into the nether world where it languished until revivified by the next rainy season. The cycle of the sun, Amiet says, is entirely comparable. In some respects this interpretation seems to be somewhat incoherent. If the bird-man is shown triumphant, the conqueror of his adversary, it is evident that he was no longer pacific. Neither does it explain over whom he triumphs in scenes where he stands on one crouching man and grasps two others by the head (*). This episode, spoken of as " a true apotheosis ", is said to take place in the presence of storm-gods who may be explained as " bringing the humidity neces- sary for the rebirth of vegetation personified by the bird-man Apart from the difficulty of understanding how vegetation could perform so bellicose an action and noting that here it can be no question of " rebirth " if the scene is supposed to show vegetation flourishing in the acme of its development, it may be remarked that the figures mounted on dragons were not storm-gods, who were dreaded because their violence destroyed rather than benefitted vegetation; they were a procession of fertility divinities escorting the rain-goddess, an excerpt from what must have been a large composition depicting rain-making ceremonies (2). In Amieťs opinion the bird-man and the eagle were identical, but it seems contradictory to say that solar god and eagle were " two beings who never fought against each other, who triumphed together and together were overcome ", if it was the summer sun which killed the vegetation. The bird-man is believed for two rea- sons to have functioned occasionally as acolyte of the sun-god: firstly, because he was often introduced into scenes in which the " sun-god " is represented aboard the god-boat: and, secondly, because once he is shown holding a " lance bouclée " (8).

Therefore if, in the early period the divine passenger was really Enki, the first argument adduced in support of the hypothesis is abortive, and the door-post, whether held or planted, was not a special attribute of Shamash. Akkadian scenes in which the bird-man is led to Enki, and parti- cularly the example where bird-man and plant share the same fate (*), both alike being suspended inanimate from a stick borne over his shoulder by a god, have hitherto been absolutely erroneously interpret- ed, according to Amiet, for they do not represent a judgment and con- demnation. They show the defeated bird-man, the spirit of vegeta- tion, conducted to Enki, god of living waters, to be resuscitated by his fertilizing streams. In support of this theory the " perfect parallel " of an episode which befell Inanna during her sojourn in the Lower World is cited; the goddess was slain and her body suspended from a stake for three days and three nights until she was resuscitated by aspersions of the water of life which Enki apparently supplied (2). The parallel is pushed further to suggest that Inanna, goddess of fecundi- ty, may also have personified fertility. A bird-goddess is illustrated by the Burney relief (8), and the winged goddess of the seal of Adda may be a " sorte de parèdre de Thomme-oiseau ». According to Amiet the myth of Etana, which traces the life, death, and resurrec- tion of the eagle, the divine bird who lived and died with the vegeta- tion, in whose company the hero sought the " plant of the renewal of youth ", has been emasculated in the Akkadian period into a fable, a moral tale. Moreover, there was probably an analogous attenua- tion of the Epic of Zû by which the bird's flight into the mountains with the " tablets of fate ", which recalls the descent of a nature-god into the mountain, euphemism for grave, has been transformed into a sacrilegious rape. i1) Corpus I, No. 198; Amiet, Fig. 17.

Douglas Van Buren It is quite evident that the legend of Z û was radically transformed in Akkadian times, for the curious account of the banquet offered by IyUgalbanda to the wife and son of Zu demonstrates that much of the original story must have been lost or suppressed. Nevertheless, the suggestion that the flight with the " tablets of fate " of the bird-man to the mountains symbolizes vegetation which perished and sank into the mountain, synonymous with grave, seems difficult to accept. The whole description implies that the bird-man neither sank into the " mountain " nor was entombed therein, but fled of his own voli- tion to the inaccessible mountainous region. Instead of being dying or dead, he was very much alive and, owing to his possession of the " tablets of fate ", he was omnipotent to such an extent, indeed, that the trembling gods moaned in unison " Who can withstand him? It is argued that the bird-man cannot be held responsable for the plight of the astral divinity in a well-known scene because he is captur- ed and thus impeded from acting offensively Í1). But is it not more logical to think that the bird-man was captured and bound in pun- ishment for having already committed the offence ? The explanation given of the long series of scenes in which the bird- man is led to Enki (a), and particularly the discussion of the scene in which he is suspended inanimate from a stick, is entirely new.

If he were dying or dead and brought to Enki to be resuscitated, it is hard to imagine why he should be bound and treated with such contumely by his captors who often jerk the cord which binds him, or prod him from the rear, and when he has been reduced to unconsciousness they carry him in a very ignominious manner. It seems as if the parallel with what happened to Inanna is even more cogent than Amiet infers, for that story expressly re- lates that it was in consequence of what Inanna had done that she was judged by " Ereshkigal and the Annunaki, the seven judges", who pronounced judgement upon her whereby she was condemned and " turned into a corpse ", arid her body hung from a stake. The paral- lel is therefore complete, for it was on account of what he had done that the bird-man was led before Enki to be judged and condemned. Thus once again in the story of the bird-man the figure of Enki is all-important, and there is no hint of Shamash who usually presided as judge. Elsewhere I have endeavoured to show why Enki always acted as judge in cases of offences against vegetation (!). The omis- sion of Shamash suggests that the scene of judgment, like that of Enki's voyage, originated in the presargonid epoch. The development of this novel theory has had the meritorious result that it has stimulated anew our interest in the story of the bird-man. Amiet has done well to note the bird-man's pacific charac- ter in early times, and to emphasize his nature as a vegetation divin- ity, for thus we are enabled to understand why he was often associ- ated with the god-boat, and why the plough, pot, and man-headed lion, usually associated with the divine voyager, are sometimes in- troduced into scenes in which the bird-man alone appears. Amiet 's interpretation of the myth as illustrated in the Akkadian documents is less easy to accept, but even so, if the vegetation elements of the bird-man's nature are kept in mind, it may be possible to reconcile the seemingly opposing versions by postulating that originally the bird-man was regarded as one of the lesser divinities of fertility, and was of a peaceful disposition as became the functions he exercised, apparently in rural and unsophisticated surroundings. He is depicted consorting in perfect amity with beasts both wild and tame, and was in good standing with the gods if we can judge from the early repre- H Or 20, 1951, pp. 37-8.</page><page sequence="12">58 E. Douglas Van Buren sentations and the account of Iiis familiarity with the palace of Anu. But these idyllic conditions did not last. The bird-man fell from grace, whether from overweening pride or some other cause, and is afterwards shown in the guise of a fallen angel. If the surmise as to the early origin of the judgment scene is correct, the change of charac- ter and the reason for it may have been known long before the Akkad- ian period. That period would certainly have been more concerned with the second part of the story because that could be more easily re-adjusted to bring it into conformity with the cult of Shamash. The Akkadian representations often contain incongruous details, and do not really illustrate what is supposed to be the revised, Akkadian version of the legend. Yet the connection of the bird-man with vegetation was never forgotten although it was sadly changed in character, and the core of the myth, the bird-man in idyllic surround- ings, remained unaltered.</page></plain_text>
