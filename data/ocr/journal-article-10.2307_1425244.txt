<plain_text><page sequence="1">In a grid-iron city of streets all right-angled a tri-cornered building stood out as new fangled. This steel-framed palazzo of twenty floors stacked created a stir with its urban impact. For when it was built (mark the time, note the date) was three decades preceding the Empire State. Photographers came by reflex and by habit; among them were Steichen and Stieglitz and Abbott. Majestic, imposing, and oozing with flair, a quite different aspect was equally rare: Twas the air! whipped around, aeronautically sped, which produced an effect that could turn a man's head. For the turbulent breezes, on hitting the ground, were reversed in direction-they turned right around- thus producing an updraft, a blast from below, which could rustle a bustle or loosen a bow. Then, in days of long dresses, so modest, so chaste, a mere glimpse of an ankle left ladies red-faced, and a well-turned leg, once released from its wraps, could attract quite a crowd of appreciative chaps. Thus the corner where Broadway cuts through Twenty-Third was a favorite roost for the masculine bird. Now we call a man sexist, an arrogant sort, for girl-watching, whisting, and other such sport. And doubtless the point is correct and well-taken: The chauvinist view is both crass and mistaken. But try to imagine an earlier time, when sexual mores gave reason and rhyme to suppress all discussion of matters of flesh, when manners decreed, "Don't be rude! Don't be fresh!" In that prudish context, in that frame of mind, when most close encounters were optic in kind, imagine the passion, the thrill, the delight, when anatomy's secrets were seen in the light! So to guard public morals at Fifth and Broadway a constabular warning was heard night and day near the building constructed in 1902 when a well-turned leg came at last into view: "Twenty-Three Skidoo!"

Monsters of Architecture: Anthropomorphism in Architectural Theory Marco Frascari Rowman and Littlefield, 1991 140 pp., 38 illustrations $43.00 (cloth) This provocative book by Marco Frascari, accompanied by photographs and demonstrative drawings by the author, is a work "to think with" from within the discipline of architecture about the most pressing problems confronting our profession. Frascari's discourse belongs to a tradition of architectural theory seeking the "reconstruction" of architecture in a time of crisis. It seeks to open up questions without assuming the possibility of final answers, pondering the historical traces of architecture and unearthing hints that may help us in our difficult task of constructing a human order without forgetting the specific reality of our post-Cartesian culture. Frascari argues for a radicalization of the phenomenological insights present in Merleau-Ponty's philosophy. In this context, he posits the relationship between architectural works and the human body as metonymic and no longer metaphoric (the dominant relationship in classical theory): "Architects can no longer do without the identification of the human body and its elements in the architectural body" (p. 4). Avoiding naive isomorphic relationships, the issue is to use the body to attain new kinds of instrumental and theoretical representations, to recognize "corporeal presence," and to "make visible that which is invisible" (p. 4), the inveterate task of the architect. Besides the phenomenology of Merleau-Ponty, Frascari uses the works of Giambattista Vico, Gianni Vattimo, and Hans Blumenberg as cornerstones for his hopeful view on a potential architecture of presence. He reminds us, with Vattimo, that it is not enough to demythicize demythization to rediscover the truth in the mythopoeic. It is necessary to preserve the universality of dreaming and the continuation of the dream (p. 8). The process of demythi- zation in architecture, which began in the eighteenth century, refuses the corporeal nature of building and focuses on a limited functionalism. The traditional embodiment of myth in architecture September 1992 JAE 46/1 58</page><page sequence="2">served humanity to find a breathing space vis-a-vis what Blumenberg has called "the absolutism of reality," making a symbolic order that protected human beings from the anxiety derived from the relation- ship between our mortal, biological nature and the natural environ- . ment (p. 9). Frascari recognizes that the radical demythization of the Enlightenment removed the kernel of architectural knowledge. Thus, a --! -architecture agonizes and lives in crisis. What he proposes is a reread- -=- ;9 ing of the relationship between representation and function that stems from the eighteenth-century expositions of Carlo Lodoli. This tradi- tion of architectural theory, with significant connections to Vico's philosophy, offers alternatives that are still fertile in our own nihilistic times. "For architecture, the body is the utter monster" (p. 9). The 'l.,.-^a-- hidden power of the grotesque image is that it always crosses its own "-:'--- boundaries and demonstrates the presence of the chiasm (Merleau- . '--'. I Ponty), the unnameable ground of reality. Frascari makes the focus of his book the discussion of proper "demonstration" in the "construing" and "constructing" of a meaningful, "non-trivial" '-- architecture. The guiding insight here is Vico's understanding of the univocal relationship between that which humans can truly know and ' that which they make. Frascari reads this as the union of construction -i and reason in architecture, unified by a conception in a representation (an exercise in detailing) guided through embodied making by fantasy and memory confronting the materiality of the artifact. Given this thesis, and despite the fact that Frascari's argument ij ~ about monstrosity can be held to be transhistorical as a figure for the ontological dimension of architecture, it is not surprising that the strongest section of the work is the one dedicated to the historical :_ "'_ \ elucidation of Lodoli's theory and its repercussions for a post- Enlightenment practice of architecture. The author contrasts the .'"--'. "neoclassical body," which is naturalistic and objectified, with the ?= ' ': "grotesque body," a body "in the act of becoming" (p. 32), one that is continually created and whose image ignores the smooth and impenetrable surfaces of neoclassical bodies to put its emphasis in excrescences and orifices. Foucault has shown that the very possibility of perceiving the human body in terms of such polarities is only present after the seventeenth century. Concurrently, the notion of a "syntactic normality" in architectural styles has been possible only since the early nineteenth century. Thus, Frascari's interpretation of Lodoli's dictum "let function be the representation" in terms of Vico's thorough questioning of the Cartesian conception of reality is particularly relevant for us. Lodoli's motto has been used to corroborate statements like "form follows function." Questioning this misinterpretation, Joseph Rykwert has suggested that this motto alluded to Lodoli's interest for architectural elements to demonstrate their structural function, a kind of metaphoric relationship between 59 book reviews</page><page sequence="3">statics and aesthetics. Frascari takes the argument further: "Making ar- chitectural elements the basis of demonstrations of concepts rather than being unrelated to concepts, the idea of representation embodied in the motto is an expression of a theory of image that enunciates that the monstrosity of functional representations, i.e., their deformation and distortion, should prevail over the sublime dimension of historical figures" (p. 33). Exploring a work of Zaccaria Seriman, a lesser-known disciple of Lodoli, the author reiterates the critical awareness present in this Venetian circle concerning the limitations of Aristotelian mimesis (imitation) and the understanding of proper artistic practice based on "making," that is, an imitation of procedures rather than forms. Art (and artifacts in general) would thus become the implementation of an imagination "other" than the mimetic classical imagination but also distinct from the Romantic imagination, avoiding the pitfalls of a godlike creation that purports to start from nothing. Grounded on Vico's "imaginative universals," this theory assumes that cognitions derive from a system of representational knowledge that does not separate the instrumental from the symbolic. Vico compares " rational metaphysics," which teaches that humans become all things by understanding them, to his "imaginative metaphysics ... truer than the former," which shows that humans become all things by not understanding them, for when "man understands, he extends his mind and takes in the things, but when he does not understand, he makes the things out of himself and becomes them by transforming himself into them" (p. 50). In the following chapter, Frascari "demonstrates" his theory through the works of several twentieth-century Italian architects and James Stirling's Gallery in Stuttgart. In my view, the most successful demonstrations concern Carlo Scarpa and Massimo Scolari and the connection of the argument on monstrosity to surrealist intentional- ity. Here Frascari opens up a controversial debate about architectural representation that he follows up in the last chapter. He first asserts that "architecture cannot be shown in museums" because visual arti- facts like drawings or models may connote architecture but are unable to "denote" architectural qualities and properties. Then, in an analysis of Scolari's Hypnos: The Room of the Collector for the 1986 Milan Triennale, he states that architectural monsters, the authentic prod- ucts of architectural poetry, "belong to (the) world-in-between ... a space of extraordinary fantasy that is different [italics added] from the space of ordinary fantasy and imagination" (p. 84). This assertion de- mands in the case of Scolari a more radical "redefinition" of architec- ture vis-a-vis the fine arts and its place in the post-industrial city than the buildings of Giuseppe Samona, Saverio Muratori, and Mario Ridolfi, which are also "demonstrated" in this section. Appropriately, Frascari returns to the drawings of Scarpa in his last chapter to confront some of these questions. Citing Umberto Eco, he states, "In drawings a sign is not only something which stands for something else; it is also something that can and must be interpreted" (p. 92). A "non-trivial building" must be the result of this process of interpretation; good architecture must acknowledge that it is the result, not of a reductive transcription, but of "translation" of a drawing into a building. Rather than being merely prescriptive, drawings must become "prosperous" tools for the builder (p. 94). Frascari also traces this intention back to Lodoli's tecnografia, a term coined to name the correct use of representation in the practice of architectural technology. Needless to say, Scarpa's drawings are masterful palimpsests of architectural technography. They are not images of future building but rather analogical demonstrations of its construction (p. 105). This strategy for architectural drawing is seen as a possible alternative for the present reality of architecture. The design agenda must be grounded "on an understanding of architecture as a system of repre- sentational knowledge resulting from technological signs," and it de- pends on the Viconian notion of "imaginative universals" and the possibility of generating philosophical "understanding" from the im- age. In the past, architectural drawings were graphic projections of ex- isting or future buildings, and the symbolic and instrumental representations were unified in the building, but in the present situa- tion, this relationship cannot be taken for granted. Today, concludes Frascari, "the union of the symbolic and instrumental representations in the building depend on their presence and union in the drawing; therefore, the drawing should be a monster" (p. 109), like any non- trivial building. Isn't this argument already more radical than it may appear? In my view, it offers the only possible alternative for architecture in a world of simulations. Architecture (in the sense of our tradition of revealing the invisible in the visible) is drawing. It is the theoretical project. For this, we must accept the radical implications of the end of the "fine arts," the end of a Master Narrative. The old categories that still manage to creep up and confuse the issues have in fact disintegrated. If we truly wish for an architecture of presence, for more buildings to dwell poetically on this earth, embracing the democratic politics that must hope to collapse aesthetic and technological values in the search for the embodiment of a "weak" truth (Vattimo), we must engage, both in practice and education, the radical consequences of Frascari's realization for architectural representation.
