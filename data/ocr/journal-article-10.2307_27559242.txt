RETHINKING COMMON SENSE ASSUMPTIONS Matthew Trachman and Cheryl Bluestone Abstract, One of the most basic tasks in introductory social science classes is to get students to reexamine their common sense assumptions concerning human behavior. This article introduces a shared assignment developed for a learning community that paired an intro ductory sociology and psychology class. The assign ment challenges students to rethink the widespread belief that romantic love is a natural, normal, and inevitable part of the human condition and then encour ages them to begin to use the principles of empirical research to examine the phenomena of romantic love. Every human society rests on assumptions that, most of the time, are not only unchal lenged but not even reflected upon. In other words, in every society there are patterns of thought that most people accept without question as being of the very nature of things. ?Peter Berger At an elementary level, sociological and psychological thinking requires that one be willing to challenge the com mon sense assumptions of one's culture. Berger reminds us that in their classic study of Middletown, Robert and Helen Lynd (Lynd and Lynd 1957) labeled these common sense assumptions as "of Matthew Trackman is an associate professor and Cheryl Bluestone is a professor at Queensborough Community College in Bay side, New York. course" Statements: statements that are thought to be so thoroughly part of the very nature of things that when ques tioned about them, members reply with the statement "Of course . . .". In an introductory sociology class, one of the tasks of the teacher is to get students to reflect on "of course" assumptions?to recognize the unchal lenged and unnoticed patterns of thought of which Berger speaks (1977). While the experience of travel or emi gration can induce culture shock, and an awareness of cultural difference, mem bers of a culture often seem to exist within their culture as fish do in the sea. Fish do not swim around in the sea thinking, "Thank God I'm not on land." Their physical and social context is everything they know. Similarly, the social context in which humans exist is often simply taken for granted. Introducing students to sociological thinking requires that we help students to free themselves from the conventions of their society, so that they can begin to study those conventions. To do this, stu dents need to begin to see that while what seems natural, normal, and inevitable to members of a culture, when analyzed in detail or viewed by an outsider, their taken-for-granted social context often seems bizarre. In a sense then, Berger argues, socio logical thinking has an inherent debunk ing effect. It shows the precariousness of things that ordinary members had assumed to be solid. It brings into view the possibility that our deepest-held views of human nature may be merely conventions of a cultural community. Sociology achieves this debunking in a number of ways. According to Berger, it shows up the fallaciousness of socially established interpretations of reality by demonstrating that the facts do not gibe with the "official" view, or even more sim ply, by relativizing the latter (by showing that it is only one of several possible views of society). (1977) Debunking the conventional, socially programmed logic that often guides stu dents' personal theories of behavior is also an essential element of the survey psy chology class. Indeed, Kassin (2001) begins his general psychology textbook with a ^common sense psychology quiz" to emphasize the point that common sense Vol. 53/No. 4 131</page><page sequence="2">assumptions or beliefs are often not sup ported by evidence. For example, most of us believe we will be more likely to receive help in an emergency when there are many people nearby. However, the research on bystander interventions shows us otherwise (Latane and Darley 1970). Though they may be off the mark, pre conceived theories often have a powerful hold on students?and those preconcep tions may limit students' ability to criti cally examine material or even to process new ideas. There is a broad consensus emerging from the fields of educational and cognitive psychology that students' knowledge is constructed on their prior beliefs or preconceptions. Bransford, Brown, and Cocking (1999) vividly illus trate this by making an analogy to a chil dren's picture book titled Fish is Fish (Lionni 1987). In this story, a frog returns to his pond after exploring life on land and describes what he has seen of that world to the fish who are his friends. However, the fish can only imagine the frog's descriptions of people and birds in a fishlike form; they are unable to modify their schema of the world. Contemporary views of best practices in learning sug gest that instructors need to elicit and monitor students' existing knowledge and beliefs and then build on them to ensure that students will learn with understand ing (Bransford, Brown, and Cocking 1999). Even with careful monitoring, instruction, and assessment, a significant percentage of students may maintain their prior misconceptions (Ebert-May, Batzli, and Lim 2003). At the same time, hands on activities without such monitoring may not lead to greater student under standing unless scaffolds that promote deeper learning are introduced and exam ined by instructors (Barron et al. 1998). For example, undergraduates have diffi culty learning and understanding the complexities of natural selection in part because they have a mindset in which they view phenomena of the natural world with a sort of anthropomorphism in which there is an assumption of orches trated "deliberate" processes. Thus, stu dents view terms such as the "struggle" for the fittest to "survive" quite literally. These misconceptions interfere with stu dents' ultimate understanding of the role of chance genetic mutations in the con text of environmental contingencies. Knowledge of such concepts is essential to a meaningful understanding of evolu tionary processes (Moore et al. 2002). Similarly, with regard to scientific think ing in the social sciences, students have long integrated the meaning of the terms "positive" and "negative" as they are used in their daily experiences. It is quite diffi cult for many of them to essentially "unlearn" this engrained view to recog nize the unique meaning of these terms as they apply to understanding correlations in the research methods unit. Hands-on experiences in applying these terms can help students to "get it"?particularly when there is immediate and concrete feedback on their ideas. Several computer based simulations of correlations may provide students with this type of imme diate, visual feedback on their notions (Bluestone 2003). As instructors for foundation courses in sociology and psychology, we shared the goal of challenging our student's precon ceived theories. In fact, what we hoped to initiate was a process of critical thinking in which students would be challenged to reconsider common sense assumptions concerning human behavior. Thematically linking the two foundation level social science courses seemed a particularly effective way to encourage students to reexamine their assumptions with new, and significantly more critical perspec tives. In a sense, our hope was not only to problematize the common sense assump tions of our students, but also to show that no single academic discipline, on its own, completely explains human behavior. Although there is a significant degree of overlapping interests in the sociologi cal and psychological traditions, it is also true to say that there are some significant differences in how psychologists and sociologists study human behavior. Soci ology as a discipline begins with the assumption that there are forces external to the individual that shape the behavior of individuals, whereas on the whole psy chology tends to emphasize individual, internal forces that shape behavior. Of course, this is not to say that sociologists are unconcerned with, let us say, person ality, nor that psychologists are ignorant of human culture, but that each discipline tends to locate its own level of analysis and each has its own research trajectory. Yet throughout our years of teaching, we both have encountered students who, on their own initiative, will begin to discuss in their sociology class material that they had learned in their psychology class (and vice versa). We thought, therefore, that it would be especially meaningful to link a survey psychology and sociology class, to introduce students to the ways in which all the social sciences are engaged in a collective endeavor to understand human behavior, and also the ways in which psychology and sociology approach human behavior differently. Why a Learning Community? Learning communities (LCs) are peda gogical approaches that involve some coor dination of the curriculum between two or more courses along with more intensive faculty collaboration and involvement with the students. LCs range from fully inde pendent courses that are linked only because they have common students en rolled, to fully integrated programs associ ated with a particular theme or content area major. Regardless of the model, LCs are associated with several positive outcomes in terms of student achievement and reten tion (Stassen 2003). LCs have been found to foster a sense of community and encourage the develop ment of more sophisticated learning strate gies (Stephanou and Salisbury-Glennon 2001). A hallmark feature of learning com munities is the examination of issues from multiple perspectives, a feature that is asso ciated with the development of higher order cognitive skills (Cooper and Robin son 2000). Finally, small group and collab orative learning (an important feature of LCs) have robust effects on student achievement, effects that are significantly greater for persons of color and Latina/os (Springer, Stanne, and Donovan 1999). As faculty in an urban community college with an extraordinarily diverse student population, the creation of a sociology/ psychology learning community seemed a potentially useful tool. With these goals in mind, we set out to create shared activities between the two courses using the theme of love, gender, sexuality, and relationships; a theme that past experience taught us would spark interest and generate genuine student engagement with the course material. 132 COLLEGE TEACHING</page><page sequence="3">Romantic Love Romantic love is the initial example we have used as the basis of our learning com munity. Despite the variety of values that students subscribe to, one of the most widely shared interpretations of reality, even among this diverse group, is the belief in romantic love. It is one of the most pervasive socially established inter pretations of reality; it is an omnipresent "official" view of this culture. It is a clas sic "of course" statement. Of course peo ple fall in love. Of course we are destined to meet our soul mate. Of course lifelong monogamous love is attainable and desir able. For those raised in a culture of romantic love, the idea of "falling in love" appears to arise from emotions that are both inevitable and universal in nature. Having been nurtured into a culture of romantic love, members believe that "Birds do it, bees do it/Even educated fleas do it/Let's do it/Let's fall in love" without the irony that Cole Porter intended. To begin this collaboration, we devel oped an anonymous survey to elicit the students' beliefs with regard to romantic love. Students were asked to write a para graph or so to fill in the blank sentence: I know I'm in love when_. Once the paragraphs were written, stu dents were also asked to provide other kinds of information: their age, their sex, the number of people in their family, the number of love relationships they have been in, the number of times they have attended some kind of religious service in the past year, and so on. The students' responses to this survey are first used in the sociology section, where this infor mation is the focus of discussion. Soon, however, the data generated by these responses are examined in the survey psychology class. In sociology the instructor begins by reading students' (anonymous) responses out loud. As he reads their responses he generates categories into which students' responses fall. Some of the common cat egories are: 1. Obsessional thinking. Many students complete the sentence "I know I'm in love" by describing what a psychologist might call obsessional thinking. One twenty-four-year-old male put it this way: "I know I'm in love when I think about that special person 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 or 366 days a year. I see their face everywhere I go ... I can't look at anything or anyone without thinking about them. My heart fills with joy at the mere thought of spending one microsec ond with them." 2. Feelings of selflessness. Another common category of response to the statement "I know I'm in love when" is what one might call feelings of selfless ness. One seventeen-year-old female put it this way: "I know I'm in love when I would do anything and give anything for that person unconditionally." One twenty two-year-old male wrote, "I'd be willing to put this other person's wants and needs ahead of everything else, including my own." An eighteen-year-old female wrote that she knows she is in love "when you would stay by that person's side no mat ter what." One nineteen-year-old male wrote that he knows he is in love when "I will do anything for them. I will do any thing to make them feel better and say anything to make them smile." 3. Physical symptoms. Another common category into which students' responses fall is what one might call physical symp toms. Many students respond to the survey by pointing to the feeling of "getting but terflies in your stomach." This exercise works on a number of levels. On one level it provides the first opportunity to introduce the idea of social structure?the idea that our lives do not consist of a random assortment of events, but are patterned in distinct ways. When the responses have been read out loud, the instructor asks the students to character ize what they noticed having just listened to their classmates' responses. Usually without much prompting a student will point out that "people's responses sound ed the same." This insight, and the dis cussion that it provokes, allows the instructor to point out that we all don't fall in love in our own completely unique, individual way, but that there is a social structure, a pattern, to the experience of romantic love. Furthermore, for instruc tors who are so inclined, this exercise also provides data for the instructor to intro duce alternative explanations of these patterns of behavior, including evolution ary theories. At another level, and one more connect ed to the disenchanting effect that Berger is suggesting, when the students begin to hear their responses read back to them, a "teach able moment" of strangeness ensues. What had seemed natural, normal, and inevitable fifteen minutes earlier, suddenly sounds odd. Faced with what Durkheim might call the "collective representation" of romantic love, students are confronted with the falla ciousness of a socially established interpre tation of reality. While romantic love seems natural, normal, and inevitable to members of a culture, when examined in detail, or viewed as an outsider might, romantic love begins to seem strange. From this "teachable moment" stu dents are invited to consider the history of the idea of romantic love. While to mem bers of this culture romantic love seems as old as time itself, the idea of romantic love has a particular history; it is an idea that arose relatively recently, and at a par ticular time and place. The sociology text makes the point this way: Romantic love first made its appearance in courtly circles as a characteristic of extra marital sexual adventures indulged in by members of the aristocracy. Until about two centuries ago, it was wholly confined to such circles and kept specifically separate from marriage. (Giddens, Duneier, and Applebaum 2003) This separation of romantic love and sexual pleasure from marriage was typical of Western culture until the twentieth cen tury. In nineteenth century America, for instance, it was considered too risky to marry someone based on romantic feel ings, because romantic feelings were seen to be too evanescent. In addition, what we now think of as the signs of love were viewed as vulgar emotions, and those who acted on them were thought to be morally weak. In nineteenth-century America, the dominant cultural ideal was the notion of spiritual love in which men and women joined together in a morally uplifting mar riage (Seidman 1991). Furthermore, while sexual arousal and its related somatic symptoms (such as getting butterflies in your stomach) are biologically based, these responses can be understood either as "lustful," ungodly tendencies which must be resisted, or as one of the most highly prized parts of the human experi ence. They can be thought of as properly Vol. 53/No. 4 133</page><page sequence="4">shared with one (monogamy), or properly shared with many (polygamy); properly shared only with members of the opposite sex, or also properly shared with members of the same sex; properly found with one's spouse, or more appropriately found in one's adulterous affairs. This discussion also allows the sociol ogy instructor to relativize the official view, as Berger puts it, by showing that romantic love is only one of several pos sible ways that intimate relationships can be organized. Not only is it the case that at earlier historical moments members of our own culture have viewed the emo tions that we associate with romantic love differently than we do, but other cultures ?for instance, cultures in which the dominant ideal is arranged marriage? would likely view our beliefs in romantic love as strange. As awareness of these possibilities emerge, students can now understand what it means when a sociol ogist says that society and culture help to structure our beliefs and emotions. Through this activity, students' com mon sense beliefs with regard to roman tic love have been challenged, but with the linked course we can take this one step further. We want students to become active learners, mentally engaged with the course content (Blue stone 2000). Another goal is to teach the students to become critical thinkers?to be able to evaluate evidence and consid er multiple perspectives. Thus, we want them to recognize, as Kalat (1999) sug gested, "anybody?even a professor or a textbook author?has strong reasons for some conclusions. . . . Don't be satisfied if someone suggests, Take my word for it.' Ask for the evidence. Then you can draw your own conclusions." With this backdrop in place, the results of the sur vey are used in the psychology class to introduce students to a different critical thinking skill?a movement away from an impressionistic description of the responses toward a more rigorous attempt to use the scientific method to examine the evidence and characterize the data we have collected. Thus, while students in the sociology section of the LC were examining notions of social and cultural constructions of romantic love in sociology, they were engaged in an active process of learning about research methods and statistics in the psychology component. Research methods and statistics is typically a dry and formidable topic that often creates fear and disinterest even among graduate students (Connor 2003; Giesbrecht et al. 1997; Hewett and Porpora 1999; Lanier 2002; Piotrowski, Bagui, and Hemasina 2002). The course material was presented in a computer lab equipped with a Smart Board and twenty-four Internet-ready computer workstations. This allowed the students opportunities to actively exam ine simulations of statistical concepts available on line once the major concepts had been covered in class.1 Next, the data collected from Dr. Trach man's other sociology sections was examined. Students worked in pairs or groups of three to first learn how to code data?a task they seemed to enjoy immensely. Students soon realized that coding the students' written responses into the categories Dr. Trachman described was not quite so clear-cut. For example, some responses met the criteria for more than one category, and so they decided to create a variable, "mixed," for this; other responses did not fit into any category, so they created a variable called "other." These "teachable moments" afforded students with the opportunity to experience firsthand the realities and problems of coding data?realities that are in fact typical of the kinds of difficul ties encountered in the research process at all levels (Gelman and Nolan 2002). The students quickly learned how to cre ate variables, and how to code and enter the data into SPSS . With help from the instructor, the students conducted rudi mentary statistical analyses to address (among other things) whether in fact the collected responses fit into the categories described by their sociology instructor. Although limited in scope, through this simple shared project, students gained experience in conducting an investigation and examining ideas using real data that was meaningful to them. The last segment of the psychology component of this project was the requirement that students write a first draft of the results of their investigation using the format of a lab report to report their findings and, in particular, to address how well these data fit with the ideas they were presented with in the sociology section. After receiving feed back from the instructor and a graduate writing fellow, final drafts of the lab reports were submitted. Thus, this linked assignment between two social science courses afforded students with an in-depth opportunity to critically evaluate a different worldview about love while gaining firsthand knowledge of the steps involved in two approaches to active investigation. Applications to Additional Course Contexts This assignment has been presented in the context of a learning community that paired survey courses in sociology and psychology. However, with some minor modifications, the activity presented here might be implemented in learning com munities linking survey sociology with other disciplines. The notions that are derived from the "teachable moment" encountered in the examination of "natur al" ideas in the sociology course can be critically examined from a variety of per spectives. For example, if sociology were linked with a biology course, the patterns of romantic love could be examined and considered in light of the potential bio logical explanations of these patterns. What are the physiological responses to feelings of love? Are they universally experienced? If so, how does the evi dence cited by those who subscribe to the evolutionary view of human behavior jive with the sociological view? Similarly, a shared activity with a history course might encourage students to examine his torical views about love in more depth. Indeed, to expand on the "I know I'm in love . . ." activity conducted in a sociolo gy class, history students might expand their understanding by reading the text Romantic Longings: Love in America 1830-1980 (Seidman 1991). In a linked sociology and English course, students might be asked to consider the rich liter ary tradition of treatments of romantic love. In fact, as part of this instructor's sociology class, students read and write about the philosophically sophisticated novel titled On Love (De Botton 1993). The novel raises intriguing questions about views about love, including the belief in "romantic fatalism"?the belief 134 COLLEGE TEACHING</page><page sequence="5">that there is one special person out there who we are destined to meet and fall in love with?in the midst of an engaging tale of love at first sight. These brief illus trations are just a few of the possible ways this activity could be extended to disciplines beyond those described in this piece. Nevertheless, the goal of each of these activities would remain essentially the same: to build on a teachable moment to critically examine what seemed to be common sense from multiple perspec tives. Some research suggests that trans fer of learning is more likely to occur when students are asked to apply learning in similar contexts and with some "domain knowledge" (Barnett and Ceci 2002). The integration of shared, interdis ciplinary assignments in linked courses may thus promote change in the students' problem-solving skills beyond the scope of one set of learning experiences. Students7 Responses Students' responses to the learning community sections and shared themes have been positive. For example, the results of an anonymous survey at the end of the semester suggested that the stu dents found several aspects of the inter disciplinary work and the writing activi ties beneficial. For 85 percent of the students, the shared writing assignments helped them understand the course mate rial from both courses better, and 91 per cent felt that they could apply what they learned in one course to the other?in fact 97 percent reported this was true "some what." In that survey, 94 percent felt that participating in a Learning Community helped them to see how different disci plines viewed the same material. Finally, in a separate measure, conducted by the psychology instructor to examine stu dents' perceptions of the laboratory activ ities, virtually all the students reported that having an opportunity to examine those experiences helped them to under stand how ideas learned in the psycholo gy course applied to other science and social science courses. Although these student responses sug gest the students felt they benefited from the activities described in this article, we think that something more intangible emerged as well. As a result of the linked educational experience, students devel oped richer connections to one another and what developed was a truly coll?gial atmosphere (at a commuter college). Stu dents also became active, collaborative learners who developed informal peer net works to review ideas and material. For instance, it was not unusual to find stu dents, especially around exam time, sit ting in their sociology class before the class began, talking about concepts that were going to be on an upcoming psy chology quiz. Ironically, they felt they needed to explain what they were doing, as if they had been caught doing some thing that they should not be doing. Fur thermore, our readings and discussions do appear to move students to reconsider, at least for a moment, their common sense assumptions concerning love. Students clearly enjoy playing with the possibility of criticizing and defending love, and classroom discussions are energized by the discussion of this topic. One particu larly bright student reported that as a result of our classroom activities she had begun to ask her family and friends "What they think love is and how they know they are in love?" After impressing on her how exciting it was to hear that she was active ly engaged in the sort of research that social scientists do, I asked her what she had learned from that experience. She replied that what was, as she put it, "weird" is that the more she repeated the word, the less she knew what it meant. It is in the midst of teachable moments like this that true learning can begin. Key words: social science, love, assump tions NOTE 1.
