<plain_text><page sequence="1">Dogmad or dubliboused? Fritz Senn The text for my sermon is lifted out of the Fable of the Mookse and the Gripes in Finnegans Wake: "For the Mookse, a dogmad Accanite, were not amoosed and the Gripes, a dubliboused Catalick, wis pinefully obliviscent" (FW 158.3). Practical convenience and ig norance make it advisable to disregard the context, except to point out a strong theological flavor, and to treat the pair of adjectives merely as an essential contrast, a summary of basic attitudes. The first term is built around the word "dogma," which stands for a kind of truth that has been settled, incontrovertibly, by some author ity like the Church. Against such assurance we have "double," "duplic ity," "dubiosity," or some related notion, as well as of course some free circulation of Dublin booze which in turn might suggest the voicing of conflicting opinions (originally, dogma just meant opinion). Now "doubt" and "dubium" are based on duo, two, a going in two direc tions. Once you have a choice of two or more you get doubt .or, in theology, heresy (which is the Greek word for choice). Compare also the German zwei and Zweifel, which, in the version "on his zwivvel" precedes the passage quoted above; it is balanced against "glaubering," containing "Glaube," belief (FW 157.12, 11). Some familiar positions within the Shaun-Shem polarity are manifesting themselves once more. There is abundant evidence to show that dubious Gripes is closer to Joyce than doctrinaire Mookse. Or that Shem elsewhere is "of twosome twiminds" (FW 188.14), which is an etymological illustration of doubt. Or I could argue that "choice" is not a far cry from the name Joyce, an author who was aware of the portent of names. It is the opinion, for example, of Adaline Glasheen in the Third Census that phrases like "the real choice" or "hopesome's choice" (FW 161.15, 432.36) refer to Joyce himself. Moreover "dubliboused" includes bous, Greek for ox, the totem animal of Stephen Dedalus.1 But to prove that the author has affinities with some of his fictional characters or par ticular biases can never determine the issue, especially when authority itself is in question. 237</page><page sequence="2">However, if you set dogma against doubt, the result is doubt and the necessity of choice. Which is what the Wake invites us to even in the majority of its words. When "dogma" is augmented by one letter "d" (a letter which, in a theological domain, would seem to be most potent; notice that both adjectives begin and end with that same letter), the result is not more authority but rather a subversion of the exalted meaning. A dogged sort of tenacity is stressed. The word also becomes anagrammatically blasphemous. So even into the term whose primary function seems to be to exemplify dogmatic certainty, some heresy is planted. Of course we might object that madness (as well as inebriation in "-boused") can be an alternative, non-rational way of arriving at the truth, in vino veritas, etc., but such Dionysian kind of veritas would clash with accepted dogmas. So the fairest way to assess the duality is to say that it is a duality and invites choice. And that we don't know which one of the alter natives (in themselves alternatively at variance) is preferable. But if you don't know it becomes difficult to be dogmatic. This, sadly enough, is the whole point. And not even a point that many Joyceans would disagree with ?in theory. Which then leaves the question that continues to intrigue me ? the question of how we, as Joycean readers, when we could benefit from such a unique education in applied skepticism, can still be as dogmatic in our own practical performances as in fact we are. When you might even say that Joyce's later works are consistently and blatantly also about How do we know when we think we know? Why are our own legislative inclina tions so strong? Joyce himself ?for what that is worth ? appears to have moved away from pontifical assurance. In the phase of his dedalescence he could hold forth and lay down the law, among friends, in public lec tures, in writing, in no uncertain terms, about Drama, and Life, and Art. Stephen Dedalus, with his precisely worded and obviously memorized esthetic propositions, still reflects some of that phase. But we observe the author dissociating himself from Stephen. However we may apply Stephens esthetic doctrines in Stephen Hero or in A Por trait of the Artist as a Young Man, by the time we come to Ulysses we are less likely to take his Shakespeare theory straight. We can watch Stephen manipulate facts and sources and may well become more interested in his own concealed motivation, or in some reverberating analogies, than in any literary truths that are conveyed. These may still be present, in some circuitous way, but they would have to be 238</page><page sequence="3">placed, as Mr. Best has it, "in the larger analysis." And the fact that at the end of his discourse Stephen admits, or pretends, not to believe his own theory, becomes part of some larger analysis. Later in life Joyce was much more hesitant to make pronouncements on any big issues. Somehow we are not tempted to glean his Collected Wisdom on Life and Literature from any letters written, say, after 1910, but when we want to find Joyce backing some of our own pet theories, his pristine relicts like Stephen Hero or early Notebooks offer themselves readily. Scholars, and that includes Joyceans, naturally believe in their own theories. In the following pages I am going to suggest, naively, platitudinously and repetitively, that we might present such theories with less show of assurance and with, at times, a bit more Socratic modesty. To claim less is sometimes more convincing. So I am going to take a few concrete instances of what seem to me unduly dogmatic positions, as good an opportunity as any to air a few prejudices. "Suspecting the answer know" (FW 286.26) At the Paris Symposium of 1975 a lively discussion turned around Finnegans Wake. Philippe Sollers made his point most succinctly by saying, first, that the English language is dead and, secondly, that the only thing alive within it ?and he conspicuously put his hand upon the red volume in front of him ? is Finnegans Wake. Against this Leslie Fiedler rose and pronounced Finnegans Wake dead, as I understood it, on grounds of the elitism of its language. Now obviously there was a strong hyperbolic and rhetorical element in these two contradictory formulas, in accordance with the occasion, and I am not sure either of the speakers was trying to be more than metaphorically emphatic. Even so we were faced with large conflicting generalities. (Philippe Sollers, moreover, confused the issue by speaking French, appropri ately enough, but his statements had to be translated into ?not, as you might think, some Wakean dialect ?but actually into the defunct language referred to.) As it happened, the two views expressed together neatly circumscribe one of the Wake's main themes. The only point to be made here is perhaps that whenever we use the form "Fin negans Wake is ," we might do well to remember that we are engag ing in a metaphor. A somewhat more blatant example of dogmatism was offered when a friend cornered me at another Symposium to announce, in the kind of tired voice you would have expected of Hercules returning from one of his more demanding tasks: "I have decoded Finnegans Wake." And he meant that, mind you, in the strictest, secret service sense of 239</page><page sequence="4">the word. The Wake is now decoded, its message laid bare, we can finally dispense with the convoluted wrapping. I know that this scholar has invested a great amount of perceptive research to discover one important and perhaps persistent strain in the book. At the same time, the notion of de-ciphering Finnegans Wake, of replacing its ver bal texture by an authoritative translation, goes against the grain of our (which means most of our) experience of reading it. For that would freeze it into an immobile system. It is easy to reject this kind of attitude, but then we might well admit that most of us dabblers at the Wake are still haunted by some Platonic ideal to capture its quintessential core ?the ideal of the Ultimate Reduction. While one reader claims the secret of Finnegans Wake is to be found in The Book of the Dead and that everything can be traced to its Egyp tian roots, a German writer, Arno Schmidt, discovered the secret long ago and proclaimed that, once we get rid of the mythological camouflage, Finnegans Wake is nothing but Joyce's malicious tirade against Stanislaus who, as we learn, made advances to Nora in Trieste. This turns all of the Wake into a variegated brother battle, amplified a bit by distracting allusions, but there is, in this view, no room for even a paternal figure HCE and the action, of course, really takes place in Trieste.2 Now I am all in favor of a consistently Egyp tian, or biographically Triestine, reading of the Wake, or a psychoanalytical or sectarian one ?all of these can be supplementarily useful. The objection is to such delimiting formulas as "nothing but," or "fundamentally." They express some of our dearest ambitions: the intellectual imperialism of the mind makes us strive for the formula that would make us master, by categorizing and naming. It may often be just a matter of phrasing. A good American critic said, in conversation, that the Homeric analogies in Ulysses are, really "just a smokescreen" and that the operative underlying symbolism is, really, something else. We are inclined to such enlightened sweeping and it is difficult to escape the temptation to show, casually, that all previous scholars have been barking up the wrong plumtree. In fact, without a certain amount of pointed emphasis we are probably never even listened to. The notion of a smokescreen that conceals some deeper reality can be fruitful. Still I wonder by what criteria we can dismiss smokescreens so easily and establish more valid hierarchies of relevance, and whether we might not better acknowledge that Joyce's works have their own intricate way of dealing with appearances and realities and that smokescreens might well be the only accessible real ity ever. It is perhaps the lure of the grand comprehensive gesture that 240</page><page sequence="5">prompts Suzette Henke, in a recent study, to begin by telling us that Ulysses "preaches the good news' of the Logos and offers the promise of a new Bloomusalem in the Nova Hibernia of the future.'"3 Does the book preach and promise? The "new Bloomusalem," that hilarious, serious proclamation by Bloom in one of his non-real non-stage performances ? is this what the novel promises? And if so, why and how should it promise that more than any of the other grave or flip pant preposterosities of the "Circe" chapter? And what is preaching the gospel of "the Logos" in this context? St. John presumably knew what he meant, but any self-respecting Greek dictionary gives us at least one fully packed page about the word, and the Fathers of the Church have disputed the matter for centuries. We are on safer ground with the second statement, "Like Stephen Dedalus, Joyce was determined to use his artistic talents for the transformation of mankind." Was he? I hadn't even noticed that Stephen Dedalus was ever so fatuous as that and see no reason to assume that Joyce would follow suit ?but this may well be a case of my own narrow-mindedness as a reader, along with a demonstrable preference for generalities over precision on the part of the writer. Resonant certitude is not limited to general values. When we move to particulars we are likely to become less cautious. So it is quite possi ble to insist on the grounding of Ulysses on "incertitude" and "upon the void," as Marilyn French does very convincingly in her The Book as World, and yet to say, without signaling any incertitude, of the "Sirens" chapter that "the narrator's position is so extreme that the reader is forced to rebel against it."4 Here there are certain assump tions (like the presence of a narrator and his ?if it's a he ?taking a position) which may be considered either doubtful and slightly misleading or just a matter of anthropomorphic tautology and therefore unassailable, but I would like to go on record that I am not forced to rebel against any such position, even if I were to recognize such a position as anything more than a descriptive convenience. Given Ms. French's philosophical premises of Ulysses, which I am happy to see re-asserted, I am frankly puzzled by the very existence of a rigid sentence like "we must choose the total eradication of emotion or we must accept our ludicrousness."5 In passing, I would like to in vestigate how many meaningful uses of the word "must," one of the strongest in the language, are possible in literary criticism; I have yet to see a statement of the form "Stephen must. . ." that would make sense. There is plenty of scope for doubtful assurance in matters of inter pretation. Since so many documents are inspected in Ulysses and in 241</page><page sequence="6">Finnegans Wake rather inconclusively, one might be more suspicious of easy solutions than we seem to be. At the Paris Symposium Jack P. Dalton gave an example of a very precise and methodical reading of the Wake. His area was a list of Dublin lord mayors that James Ather ton had compiled long ago for the Second Census.6 Dalton, with the evidence of Joyce's actual source, rejected the majority of Atherton's candidates and worked out the exact percentage of mistaken iden tifications, lord mayors, that is, who are either not named in Fin negans Wake, or else are verbally present, but not in their capacity as lord mayors. The case of Bartholomew Vanhomrigh was cited, who is in the book as father of Vanessa but not as a municipal dignitary. This may well be so. But, quite apart from the question of the compatibility of statistical figures with Wakean identification, it would seem per missible to see Finnegans Wake as a universe where a lot is made of the commonplace that a father can also be a lord mayor, just as in Ulysses a father can be son and husband and cuckold and an advertisement canvasser and a wandering jew and.... It takes great confidence to be sure who in the Wake is playing which particular role at any given moment. This Mr. Dalton set out to do. And he realized, as some of us have not, that part of the task is to exclude meaning, in order to safeguard against the total arbitrariness of Wakean glossolalia. And so we were offered what "a real explication of Finnegans Wake looks like."7 The explication was a solid piece of documentation, a model of accuracy. I have great sympathy with Dalton's aversion to the lunatic fringe benefits of free association. We have had too much undisci plined complication de texte, we do need correctives. So Dalton warned us, when identifying Sir John Eccles, lord mayor of Dublin in 1710-11, in a passage, "handshakey congrandyoulikethems, ecclesency" (FW 535.11), immediately and categorically, against reading Eccles Street into the text as well. This may be a wise precau tion, but some of us were not as adamantly sure that the association of a street, so inevitable to most readers of Ulysses, can be rejected out of hand, on grounds of general principles. Especially since the fictitious inhabitant of number seven himself once became lord mayor of Dublin, in the "Circe" chapter (where also his hands are shaken and he is congratulated ? U 479.4) Bloom is a lord mayor by the same psychological and literary process as is HCE. One will have to take a dogmatic stand to outlaw Bloom's or the street's perhaps tangential relevance. The principle evoked by Jack Dalton was an otherwise un commented Law of Parsimony of Aristotelian reputation, a sort of Occam's razor. In my long-standing connection with A Wake Newslit ter I honestly wish we had some such criterion, and the editors would 242</page><page sequence="7">be a lot happier if the contributors all complied to some rule of par simony. At the same time, if you really want to apply a law of par simony to literature ? Finnegans Wake looks like an odd choice. It seems characterized by semantic abundance, referential indomitabil ity, a strange dynamism, and a generative force not easily restricted; and all of this is made possible by precisely such facts as that a Dublin lord mayor can become a Dublin street, and that naming the one somehow implicates the other. If it is tricky to fix the meaning of a word we can hardly expect agreement when the total nature of the Wake is in question. Let me, by way of illustration, compare two statements. One is by Grace Eckley who set out to disprove the old theory that the twin sons occa sionally merge their identities. This theory, we read, "which must pro mote an air of futility among readers, has unnecessarily diverted an entire generation from reading the novel as a novel, that is, a work adhering to certain requirements, one of which is consistency of character."8 By all means it is well to remember that Finnegans Wake is also a novel, but its conformity to the requirements of the genre may tell us much less than its frank transcendence of such categories. And you may wonder if "consistency of character" is really an out standing feature of the Wake. And then look at the view that appeared at about the same time. There also a redirection is asked for, but the other way. Margot Norris writes: "The novelistic interpretation of Finnegans Wake, which has dominated Wake criticism for forty years, has several serious shortcomings which have made a comprehensive and integrated understanding of the work difficult."9 The views are neatly opposite and go, in my simplified paraphrase, something like: "For many years the Wake has been, wrongly, seen not as what it is when in fact it should be seen as a novel ? or else not as a novel, but as a dream" (as Margot Norris has also reminded us in her book since).10 Notice that Margot Norris is far less authoritative in her phrasing and insists merely on some disadvantages of the novel istic reading. And it is this sort of relativistic acknowledgment that is otherwise often absent. I for one am not greatly excited by a contro versy of whether Finnegans Wake "is" a novel or a dream, but I am perversely fascinated by the anachronistic survival of the formula 'FW is X." It is the prototype of the algebra that we're lured into using against better judgment. On one side of the equation we have Finne gans Wake, "Shem," "ashplant," or "snow" (in "The Dead"), and on the other side we can have almost anything we champion. It is interesting to speculate on what kinds of truth can be expressed that way and what precisely we are doing when playing this game. 243</page><page sequence="8">A Portrait, thank God, is still a novel, and simpler, and we may go back to its relatively clear outlines. The protracted, groping, slowly unfolding title seems to prefigure the learning process that goes on in the five chapters. It opens, as we know, in a manner expressive of, and suited to, the exploratory mind of a child. The simplest language is at the beginning, in fact it would be difficult to match the simplicity of the opening with examples elsewhere in the Joyce canon. And the most simple sentence of them all has the form just mentioned above, an elementary pattern of an Indo-European sentence: "He was baby tuckoo." We understand that one all right, and so does the boy, for all we know. He seems to assimilate it and take it in good faith. Which is how it has to be taken for it is totally mysterious, and nonsensical as well. For it claims that he, the boy later named Stephen, is identical with the hero of a story just heard: how can Stephen be baby tuckoo? Clearly he cannot be the (doubly) fictitious character that may have been created ad hoc by his father ?and yet there is some relation be tween the two, they can be aligned. Our minds can bring them together, in a conceptive-creative act. Various academic departments can be enlisted to articulate the relation that has been created by language and which has been passed off, sneakily, as something a child could grasp. Such is the nature of the truths that we make up, or the untruths that our language provokes us to phrase. And Joyce pro vokes us, tantalizingly early, to investigate a mystery we have come to live with a trifle too comfortably. Many of our critical systems are founded on such improbabilities as "He was baby tuckoo"; Finnegans Wake somehow hinges on the same sort of mystery. Joyce, after all, started the game of predicative supererogation himself. "He" in the sentence is Stephen, to whom the story is being told. A rapport is established between the story and the person it is addressed to. The innocent statement implicates the listener and, by extension, also the reader of the novel. It is wholesome to realize that according to who "he," the listener, is the meaning of '"baby tuckoo" also changes ? and this too is what Finnegans Wake is about and it explains some of our confusion with it. We cannot, of course, do without the convenient shorthand for mula "A is X," with that simplifying copula "is," but it might be ad visable at least to register some discomfort when we use it. If we don't, our readers or listeners will provide the discomfort. As an example, the copulative history of Molly Bloom may be abbreviated. Molly Bloom has been pressed, repeatedly and sometimes with concomitant temperamental noises, into the type of mold just mentioned. Here is a partial listing. 244</page><page sequence="9">Molly Bloom is Penelope das Fleisch, das stets bejaht potted meat Nora Barnacle Ann Hathaway unreal the Holy Ghost a dirty joke an earth goddess a slut not an earth goddess a satanic mistress a distinctly lower middle-class adulteress a thirty-shilling whore a nodal point of Joyce's masculine experience etc. What do we mean by "is"? Most of us, I take it, can give assent to most entries of the catalogue as a series of attempts to circumscribe Mollyness. But notice how we respond, almost automatically, as soon as any one statement is foisted upon us as though it had some unique, clinching, ultimate relevance. Most authors (including the author) don't make such claims, but some of them seem to. It is then that our critical energies are released in corrective protest against, say, an assertion like "For all of Molly's attractive vitality, for all her fleshly charms and engaging bravado, she is at heart a thirty-shilling whore."11 Independent of our moral views of Mrs. Marion Bloom (if we're inclined to become moralistic), and independent of whether we think of thirty-shilling whores with indignation or with nostalgia ? most of us would bristle against the conclusive air of the pronounce ment, perhaps that divinely disdainful "at heart": this about a novel that also exposes the futility of judgments that aspire to be final. What falsifies such sweeping characterizations is perhaps merely that, out of typographical necessity, they have to end with a period, otherwise a signal of finality. This sign is grotesquely hyperbolized at the end of "Ithaca," wholly absent in the body of the "Penelope" chapter, and pointedly missing at the end of the Wake. Our critical ef forts sometimes look like dogged attempts to reintroduce the periods, full stops, where Joyce significantly utilized the potency of their absence. As an exercise in perception, Ulysses prepares ? or rather, literally, postdisposes ? us to challenge what we already thought we knew. After many years we now begin to wonder, collectively, if Molly's father was actually a major in the British Army, if Bloom really is or was a freemason, and who now, come on, moved that furniture? These are matters of fact in the most fact-obsessed novel, and in view of our factual ? to say nothing of the textual ? uncertainties it is even more surprising to understand the assurance with which less tangible 245</page><page sequence="10">matters are decided, the significance of Bloom's meeting with Stephen, for example. This often looks like a case of arbitrary selection and evaluation of supporting evidence. Priorities seem to be subjective. What is more important, in deciding this issue: the improbability of Stephen returning to the Blooms? ?a Homeric equivalent? ?an anti Semitic song? ?a celestial constellation? ? large scale misunderstand ing??Epps' massproduct or communal pissing or Molly's Dantean bedroom light? Why should any of these details have more symbolic or practical importance than any of the others? For all we know, the solution might be somewhere in Bloom's second drawer or in the Dublin water supply system. I am not trying to sound ironical about a favorite and fascinating pastime. I am merely wondering how inter pretative decisions come about. Consider how much has been made of Bloom's breakfast order for next morning. Here we have, at least, some positive twist and a possi ble reinstitution of proper domestic roles and reassurance for readers who would feel deprived without it. But then we can't tell if Bloom will actually get his room service. Molly may or may not oblige, the text cannot determine her resolution for if we know one thing about Molly, it is that she changes her mind. Even supposing Bloom will be served on the morning of the 17th, does that mean it will become a habit? Obviously we cannot predict even a fraction of the future breakfast habits of the Blooms. But I would like to push the uncer tainty further into the past as well and wonder if Bloom in fact did ask for his breakfast. We have only Molly's word for it, and towards the end of the novel the jury might well have learned not to trust any one person's unsupported evidence (don't forget from now on Dubliners will know that Stephen attended Paddy Dignam's funeral, because that's what the newspaper said, and that Bloom won money on a bet). It is true that the shock of an unusual request sets off Molly's monologue, her irritation is real enough and kinetic. But we are not told what exactly it was that Bloom wanted. She begins with "his breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs" (U 738) and finally escalates the order to "eggs and tea and Findon haddy and hot buttered toast" (U 764). Either the order got magnified in the reminiscence, or in parodistic elaboration but it seems to contain some fictional addition. The one constant and therefore most reliable item is the two eggs. But then it is strange that Bloom would insist on what he specifically dismissed on the previous morning: "Ham and eggs, no. No good eggs with this drouth" (U 56). If Bloom did give an itemized order it is also odd that the pedantic detailed account in Tthaca" fails to list it. We explicitly get a scrappy 246</page><page sequence="11">list of Bloom's modifications of his version of Bloomsday, but we are not informed about any command as innovative as the breakfast regulation. We do know, however, that the chapter's narrative slant might well withhold essential facts. But if that is true and if we have to take narrative omissions into account as well, as indeed we have to, then there is no telling what other, perhaps even more important, omissions there may be. It does not make us more assured about anything. Molly's recall of Bloom's words may be her interpretation of what the cryptic text renders as ". . .dark bed. . .roc's auk's egg" (U 737), in the last, least articulated answer of "Ithaca." This mixture of domesticity and mythology may consist of somnolent mumblings, it may be a distortion due to the relaxation of narrative control towards the end of some final chapters, or it might express the dissolution of some consciousness in the novel. It is just conceivable that the last chapter, which reveals some of Bloom's misconceptions (one is about the bed on which he falls asleep ? as if to suggest the doubtful nature of all sub-positions), is set off by one of Molly's, perhaps out of a sense of guilt. We know she misconstrues words all the time. If people interpreted each other's say ings correctly there would be no such novel as Ulysses. It would not even have a Homeric precedent, for without contrived verbal misconception Odysseus would never have escaped from the cave of the Cyclops to report the story of his adventures. Perhaps also Molly is unknowingly playing the role of Penelope as the knitter and unraveler of webs. My point is not to propound a new oval theory of the book but to show that there may be more questions than we had thought. And I am amused to think of a Ulyssean contingency where Bloom might find himself served, by a rather resentful Molly, with a breakfast he never ordered, containing eggs that he wouldn't want. A minor but instructive case of misapprehension concerns the two women who appear at the beginning of the "Proteus" chapter, "Frauen zimmer" (U 37). Stuart Gilbert called them "midwives" and this ascrip tion has perpetuated itself to find its culmination, probably, in an Index and Guide to the Dramatic Characters: MACCABE, MRS. FLORENCE Midwife and widow of the late Patrick MacCabe12 That is the kind of information we expect from a reference work, and the chances are that it will be used and passed on. Of course we know neither profession nor name of those two women. They move into the 247</page><page sequence="12">range of Stephen's sight and he notices that one carries an umbrella, "gamp," and the other "her midwife's bag." And from this attribute all the trouble arose. It occurs in a cluster of female associations, from "our mighty mother" to widow, bride, St. Bride, sister, nun, misbirth, Eve and navel ? this tells us very little about external reality, but a lot about Stephen's obsessions. The bag is real enough, but the profession of the woman cannot be inferred with any certainty. Around the solid objects perceived, gamp and bag, Stephen creates fictitious particulars by means of a Protean technique, and he uses an imaginary obituary phrase to provide the nascent character with a name and a piece of biography ? this is not Stephen recognizing some acquaintance but rather Stephen imitating Adam finding names for created things (Genesis 2:19): "Proteus" is full of it, and one way of seeing the chapter is as an elaborate gloss on that scene in Edenville. Much of our interest is "to see what he would call them"; and Genesis also prefigures the art of the chapter, philology: ". . .and whatsoever Adam called every liv ing creature, that was the name thereof" (Genesis 2:19). Subsequently, in "Aeolus," the fiction is enlarged and varied in the Parable of the Plums. There, more circumstantial detail is added and Stephen no longer calls the women midwives (if he ever did) but, with similar poetic license, "Dublin vestals" (U 145). Stephen, it is true, continues to associate them with midwives, or "babemaries" ? but this seems to be his problem. When the two women reappear, in "Wandering Rocks," we are given what looks like the most objective view: "Two old women. . trudged through Irishtown. . . one with a sanded umbrella, one with a midwife's bag" (1/242). The narrative voice sounds so unassuming and low key that it invites trust in the "midwifes bag" ?not, of course, that a person carrying such a bag has to be a midwife, any more than a person wear ing Buck Mulligans shoes or trousers has to be Buck Mulligan. And the same voice tells us, immediately, that it is a bag "in which eleven cockles rolled." Considerations of hygiene alone would make us wish then that the lady in question is not taking professional equipment out for a walk. It is much more likely that the narrative voice is not objectively descriptive, but just neutrally assimilative and incorporating earlier associations. As in that other bag, "the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward" (U 252), which we know is just a dead pan carryover of one of Richie Goulding's habitual jokes (U 88). In such a way Stephens appellation has simply shifted to the chapter of Wandering Bags. Oddly enough, towards the end of the chapter the two women, umbrella, bag, eleven cockles and all, "halted themselves,... to view 248</page><page sequence="13">with wonder the lord mayor and lady mayoress without his golden chain" (U254-55). This clearly should alert the reader to the hazards of hasty identification. The chain of all this links back, trickily, to the text as a strandentwining cable of doubtful identities. The profession of two peripheral figures in the texture does not deserve so much attention as does the ubiquitous problem of how to disentangle reality, imagination, joke, fiction, transformation, and narrative refraction. In this case we witness an already fictional character, Stephen Dedalus, within the novel creating a fictional character around him. He gives one real woman an ad hoc profession and a name, and the name that he gives (invents, or remembers, or transfers), Florence MacCabe, seems to bear some florid relation to the name that Joyce gave to his other main fictional character (who in turn helps to bring the pseudonymous identity of M'Intosh into being). And it all started with a gamp and a bag, juxtaposed. The reciprocity is striking: "gamp," we know, derives from the fictional character, Mrs. Gamp, in a novel by Dickens, and it has come now to mean an object in reality. Around an objective bag a character is created, doubly fictitious, whom we find listed later, dead serious, in a character index. Midwifery does in fact come in: the reader is actually attending a birth ? but in some obstetric transformation of which the human mind, shown in its immense fertility, or the artistic imagina tion, is capable.13 After more than half a century of Ulysses we, as readers, are still eminently fallible, even on the most elementary of all possible levels. We are led astray by first impressions, inattention, printed certitudes and by what Leo Knuth has termed "reader's traps."14 The central character of the novel is, on the whole, aware of traps and wary of his steps. Above all, he usually knows that he may be wrong. His temperament is indeed the scientific. This shows in his thoughts, words and deeds and often in parodistic exaggeration ("the distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft," etc.). That his knowledge is defective does not detract from an essentially humanistic quality of his mind. He proceeds like the traditional scien tist, he is ready to challenge his own assumptions. His skeptical turn of mind, his awkward ' on-the-other-handness," his "but thens," handi cap him against more confident monotropic opponents: the result is his hesitating approach, his wrong starts, and his reversals. Even when he sounds assertive, as in the defiant thrust "Christ was a jew like me," he is less stating a truth than pointing out an absurdity. Bloom's best advertised model, Odysseus, survived by not trusting 249</page><page sequence="14">appearances, by not accepting things at their face value and by creating strategic surfaces and guises in emergencies. He is a proto skeptic. When the nymph Calypso comes to announce that, after many long years, he is to be sent home, which he wanted all along, he instinctively distrusts the good news. The very first words that Homer gives him in the poem are of doubt: "Goddess," he said, "it is surely not my safe conveyance but some other purpose that you have in mind when you suggest that I should cross this formidable sea, with all its difficulties, in such a craft. Even the fastest sailing ships don't make the voyage. . . . " And he insists on the strongest possible assurance that language is capable of : "... so give me your solemn oath that you will not plot some new mischief against me."15 This skeptical attitude has been inherited by Leopold Bloom and should have been by scientists and literary critics. The overt meaning of words is not to be trusted automatically. Odysseus could still call divine assistance to his aid through the potent form of oaths, espe cially when addressing a demi-goddess who would be obliged to believe in the validity of language that could evoke divine repercus sions. There is no such corroboraron in the world of Ulysses where oaths, in particular, have become next to meaningless noises or fillers (expletives) to indicate emotion or emphasis. Through this world Bloom moves cautiously as, among other things, a rational being of remarkable flexibility. He observes, deduces, double-checks, modifies; he makes generalizations and can revise them. In this role he is the traditional, not perfectly equipped, but functional agnostic scientist. This etymological contradiction in terms is suitable, for Bloom like everybody else is contradictory. Especially so in a chapter which abounds in contradictions, termino logical, logical, etymological, and metaphorical ? the "Eumaeus" chapter. In this late episode Bloom's language seems the least suited to the oc casion, the least Odyssean one possible and quite unlikely to impress his new companion. Bloom's rhetorical mismanagement infiltrates the entire chapter which looks like an extension of his oddly restimulated mind. It is difficult to disentangle his associative forays from the chapter's distinctive features. "Eumaeus" hints at a way in which Bloom would talk, or write, if he had the facility of a gentleman author, it hints at a way in which Bloom would aspire to write the novel within which he occurs.16 Critics who can recognize bad writing when they see it have treated the chapter with condescension and often with premature characterization, usually having recourse to the most misleading term, "fatigue," to explain some of its awkwardness. 250</page><page sequence="15">Preparatory to anything else, I would emphasize that the chapter has so far defied our attempts to describe or classify it: to do so one might have to resort to its own tortuous language or to strain some analogies. It complies best with Senn's rule of thumb ?that when we think we know what a feature of Ulysses really is we can be sure to be partially wrong. Naturally we may turn into complacent school masters and repeat that "Eumaeus" is just a jumble of clich?s (to label something clich? is a fashionable way of indicating one's own superiority), but any honest effort to come to terms with the whatness of "Eumaeus" tends to involve us in a Bloomian struggle with appear ances, fictions, smokescreens, and diction. To separate fact from fiction is one of Bloom's concerns. His suspi cion permeates the story. Ironically, when he forgets it and becomes unquestioningly confident ("orthodox as you are" ?this to Stephen ? U 644), he is wrong. But normally he is intrigued by the identity of the sailor or the proprietor of the coffee place. He distrusts documents. It is Bloom who turns over the postcard which does not support the sailor's adventurous claims. The newspaper report of the funeral amusingly falsifies such non-partisan issues as the presence of the mourners, and the reader for once is privileged to understand some mechanisms of misinformation and Bloom's mediation. As informant, object, accomplice and victim of the communicative blunders, Bloom is deeply intricated in the tissue of untruths which one would have no reason to distrust. It is sobering to realize that when we, as scholars, want to measure the fiction of Ulysses against the reality of Dublin 1904, this reality will consist for us in precisely such documents as postcards, letters, newspapers, Thorn's Directory, or memoirs ?that is, previous fictions. Clive Hart has shown that Thorn's Directory for 1904 listed the Joyces as living in two different places and is full of similar fictitious delights.17 Such is the reliability of documents and the nature of all reports. Errors, rumors, misprints, misinterpreta tions, to say nothing of deliberate whitewashing or falsehoods, are transformed into biography or history. We are not far, at this stage, from Finnegans Wake where it has become entirely futile to sort out reality from myth or imagination. Homeric roles help to confuse the issues. Odysseus is impersonated mainly by others. Bloom remains largely truthful, his one prominent guise is a rhetorical one, he is reaching for the identity of a man of let ters. Otherwise he is not an inventor, but a discoverer of lies, a detec tive by inclination. He is explicitly related to Sherlock Holmes, look ing for clues, making deductions, shifting what little evidence there is. His approach is (at least where his own anxieties do not intrude) scien 251</page><page sequence="16">tifie; he is careful to separate "opinion" and "conjecture" from cer tainty, and he sprinkles his speech and thoughts with qualifications. We learn about his "skeptical bias": "he entertains the gravest possible doubts" throughout. He communicates poorly, but he carefully in spects fictions. His penchant for reconsideration has become gigantic. When he questions the veracity of the sailor's stories and remarks to Stephen that Murphy could "lie like old boots," he immediately revises that sentence in his thoughts in what is both an expression and a parody of a genuine intellectual perseverance in pursuit of objectivity: Yet still, life was full of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire fabrica tion though at first blush there was not much inherent probability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly accurate gospel (1/ 635). Could anyone try to be more fair? This is the tentative syntax and vocabulary of probability which always had a way of lengthening the sentence. The laborious qualifications add to the longueurs as do the metaphors freely mixed. Bloom does not express himself with the con cision of a Sherlock Holmes or a Bertrand Russell, he is groping along, and "Eumaeus" still recaptures the devious path of verbalizing kinetic thought in all its randomness. But in its nervous oscillations the style registers discomfort at the inevitable inaccuracy of its own articula tion and it proceeds to set the matter right.18 Bloom interjects modify ing phrases and various demurrers. He is alert enough to try to repair any emerging damage. It is part of the delightful incongruity of the chapter that the reiterated application of remedial logic is mismatched by the syntax. A rational order has to be hastily super- or rather post imposed on what has already been formulated. The rational mind has lost some of its pristine sharpness but is still functioning. The qualifications are afterthoughts and have to be clumsily accom modated as the sentences unfold. The syntactical joints are strained. The tardy rectifications distend the sentences which seem to come to a halt only by accident or by temporary dysfunction. This is the stylistic and grammatical equivalent of the wild goose chase after truth. The lack of finality is part of it: "Eumaeus" has its own special affinities with Finnegans Wake (and many syntactical similarities, as Hugh Kenner has pointed out): the passage quoted might easily be touched up to become an item of the convoluted defense of H. C. Earwicker. "Eumaeus" imitates the elusive and frustrating striving of language towards validity and it demonstrates as well the best that we, as readers, can do to articulate views on Ulysses or the Wake, it shows that every fleeting insight is a transitory phase in a process. In stressing a cognitive effort in its maligned style, I have so far 252</page><page sequence="17">neglected its allusive luxuriance. But this too can be seen as a hazard ous reaching out towards truth. Since it cannot be stated succinctly ? though perhaps simulated by an infinite regress of contradictions ?it may be illustrated, figuratively. So "Eumaeus" abounds in metaphor ical and proverbial wisdom, adages, figures and images, classical stock-in-trade like "the heel of Achilles." It begins, conspicuously enough, with the phrase "in orthodox Samaritan fashion" (U 613), the narrative voice introducing a method used in the New Testament, the parable, a roundabout way of saying what could not otherwise be conveyed as well. A parable is literally one thing thrown alongside another. The chapter is full of it. There are ostensible gains and outrageous risks. For a point may not be grasped ("Achilles" and "ten don" leads to "tender Achilles"? U 640, 658, 660) and any analogy adds its quota of discordant features. The chapter, as though it had its own self-reflective consciousness, is aware of this too and counteracts it by attaching yet more figurative devices. This results not in clarification but in an accumulative clash of metaphorical or etymological implications. It is easy to see that "Samaritan fashion" needs some adjectival support like "genuine"; and "orthodox" is, at first blush, a satisfactory, resounding choice until we realize that the parable of the Good Samaritan was originally directed against the complacency of the orthodox, and so the whole phrase is compro mised rather than corroborated. A noun like "fogeydom" is felt to be weak on its own and so is propped with "effete" (U 627), that conforms to a venerable stylistic pattern, but the effect is marred, as intuition or philology can tell us. For "effete" is clearly female (and related to that word), it meant "what has ceased to bring forth young," and so it is an odd bedfellow for the masculine associations of "fogey" which once meant an invalid soldier. So dormant meanings are revived and rise in semantic protest. And we in turn are alerted and may notice, for ex ample, that for all its biological unlikeliness, a transition like the one from effeteness to fogeydom was quite common in the preceding "Circe" chapter, though in a totally different mode. Or we might infer that "effete" and "fogeydom" are about as well-matched as Bloom and Stephen are in this and the next chapter, which is not to establish a significant algebraical relation between the words and the persons but simply to hint at some erratic appropriateness. The forced juxtaposi tion makes us first sit up and look closer and then perhaps realize that the oxymoronic phrase also reflects Bloom's social fumbles while the incompatibility of the linguistic roots links up with tensions in reality.19 Perversely, then, even the idiomatic lapses of the chapter can serve to impersonate the mind's devious navigations. 253</page><page sequence="18">Expecting the answer guess (FW 286.27) We are of course uncannily close to Finnegans Wake, the micro cosmic verbal integration of doubt. Suppose you want to express some elusive relation, but not with the pussyfooted caution of the "Eumaeus" mode, not in wasteful zigzag of trailing correctives and metaphorical hopscotch. You might want to try to put the qualifica tions not after the respective statement, but right into it. The result is something like the diction of the Wake, which tends towards instant contradiction. A laborious sequence of re-statements is replaced by simultaneous alternatives: serial modification becomes instant con flict. The integrity of the word (with its implied pretense of a one-to one relationship) has to be sacrificed. In the non-Euclidian grammar of dissent of the Wake too much is being said incompletely at the same time. The language becomes heretic (a matter of semantic choices): its heteroglyphy alone would put it in opposition to any kind of orthodoxy. Verbal options favor suggestive possibilities more than distinct identities. If we don't want to determine whether some person is a hunchbacked pub-keeper, or an English king, or a Shakespearean character, or the actor on the stage, in a pub, on a battlefield, or from a book or a nursery rhyme, there may be no more concise way than "when Dook Hookbackcrook upsits his ass booseworthies jeer and junket but they boos him oos and baas him aas when he lukes like Hunkett Plunkett" (FW 127.17). Luke Plunkett was a Dublin amateur actor who so nicely botched the death scene in Richard III that the au dience asked for a ricorso,20 and he now obligingly contributes to a botched non-identification in the Wake. There are numerous options for phrasing what is going on in the passage. Even if we suppress a suspicion that an evangelist or some later Irish politicians are co involved, we are hard put to determine who is, ultimately, imperson ating whom. This becomes a matter of perspective or convenience. Each person is "idendifined" in terms of the others. If, in spite of that, you still want to indulge in the reductive game of deciding that, say, "St. Patrick is Shem" or "No, no, he is Shaun," that is up to you. At the end of the Anna Livia Plurabelle chapter a voice asks "but howmulty plurators made eachone in person?" (FW 215.25), and the question is addressed to "my trinity scholard." One implication seems to be that whoever can sort out the persons of the mysterious Holy Trinity would also qualify to unravel those of the Wake. And it turns out that, the more dogmatic you choose to be, the better you are prepared for the job and the more pointless it becomes. Practically minded, I am going to illustrate the paradogmatic nature 254</page><page sequence="19">of the Wake by a last example. I am choosing the Eumaean approach; in rambling qualifications 111 try to impose subjective sense on a relatively simple sentence, 19 out of 218,076 words arranged in a cer tain order. (This is to give some quantitative dimension to the prob able relevance of the following speculations.) The aim is not any new interpretation, in fact the observations made will be commonplace, and the focus is on the dynamics of the uncertainty principle. Moreover, the context will be ignored and the passage treated as though it were a self-contained unit. It is taken from Jaun's sermon: We may come, touch and go, from atoms and ifs but we're presurely destined to be odd's without ends (FW 455.16). Note that the first part is tentative, careful, and the second part, after "but," much more assured, with the emphatic word "presurely," the only one that is not standard English. And it is the reference to the origin, what lies behind us, which is expressed with caution: "We may. " The assurance extends to what is yet to come. Experience teaches us the other way: the past usually looks more certain than the future. In similar reversion of what might be expected, the language of the more doubtful proposition is reasonably clear, on the surface, but it is far less obvious what we are presurely destined to be ?what is it to be "odd's without ends," mind you, with that disturbing apostro phe? So there are anomalies before the statement is even looked into. Something appears to be said about a general "us," about the human condition, the origin and goal of life. One account of it, the one that emerges almost of its own, looks like a popularized scientific view. It suggests probability ("may," "odd's"), it proceeds from the observation of the (once) smallest perceivable particles, the atoms, and it is aware of the hypothetical nature of all deductions. It acknowledges the chaos of appearance and the oddity of a seemingly infinite kosmos. Human destinies may be ultimately determined by the atoms which constitute bodies, and the indeterminable movements of the atoms may resemble the couplings and separations of human beings. An element of ran domness remains. The scientific mind is doing its best to impose some normative order on what it perceives. Evidently this view is colliding with an entirely different but simultaneous exposition of the human predicament, the traditional doctrine of the church. In this rendering there is no doubt about the origin: we descend from our first parents, Adam and Eve, whose doings also predetermined our fate. In this reading, "odd's" resolves 255</page><page sequence="20">itself into "God's," and "odd's without ends" can be anchored in the doxology: "world without end" ?m saecula saeculorum. Salvation is somehow connected with predestination. The two views whose outlines have become visible are in conflict, or at least they were so at some stage in history (they remind us of controversies between the Church and Science in the 19th century). Here they are merged almost totally. It is as though ?to change the ground ?the voices of Bloom (with his scientific curiosity and materialist outlook) and Stephen (whose terminology remains saturated with catholic concepts) were blended. (Remember how Stephen's "soul. . .a simple substance," of Augustinian origin, some how became Bloom's "simple soul"? U 633-34). In Ulysses a deceptive answer still had to follow a misunderstood question, or else the man ner of the "Telemachus" chapter is retroactively corrected by attitudes emerging in Tthaca." Finnegans Wake can do away with succession: contra-diction is immediate. We can (as I have tried) separate it into component dictions if we want to. But actually the two views which I dissociated are not simply there; they had to be extracted. It takes an act of interpretation to assemble the various textual stimuli into several homogenous systems. And it takes a bit of straining too. For the two overlapping accounts of life are not only subjective options but, moreover, incomplete and defec tive and literally ?as a matter of letters ?faulty. The transformation of "odd's" into "God's" can be supported by lexicography, but even so it is a transformation. And, as the documents will tell us that it occurs in oaths and asseverations, it amounts to a somewhat irreverent way to prove the linguistic existence of God. The two statements are then defective in themselves and corrective of each other, as though, under the onslaught of each one, the other were cracking a bit. The meanings are there then by some ghostly presence. Eve is really absent and con ditional, but "ifs" coupled with "atoms" makes her absence so ob trusive that she seems evoked. She and Adam are hidden, perhaps here in compliance with Genesis 3:8, but discernible. Why, anyway, should we undo Joyce's handiwork and back translate a Wakean item into what it is at such pains to evade? Fin negans Wake refuses to remain content with the habitual simplifica tions of language. Our minds, however, can only grasp simplifica tions. My own, in this case, were shaped by a desire to place the Wake within a tension between dogma and doubt, so I reduced the coexis tent conflicts into one that suited my purpose. We extract what sense we can find to rearrange it according to our needs and our categories. But let us by all means know that this is what we are doing and not 256</page><page sequence="21">confuse it with what Finnegans Wake "is." Our sentence does not just contrast science with religion, or chance with teleology. Each of the alternatives, apart from its semantic defi ciencies, contains its inherent tensions. There is no unified view of the destiny of the human soul in Christianity, Roman Catholic and prot estant terms jostle each other. The religious conception adumbrated barely conceals the seeds of its own schisms. Nor, of course, is there any generally accepted view of an atomistic universe. When Joyce was writing Finnegans Wake the concept of the atom was undergoing a change that was not only semantic: the atom all of a sudden became the opposite of what the word said it was, it became threateningly divisible, a newly discovered microcosm of its own, with great energetic possibilities. So the opinions of science had to be modified, and in the twenties a layman was moreover told by the closest observers of the atom that no accurate statements could be made about the comings, touchings, and goings of its parts so that causality was in danger. One way of phrasing all this is to say that in Finnegans Wake an emerging pattern tends to be discredited as soon as it becomes discernible. The text begins by unraveling its Penelopean tex ture at once. So far, in my reading, I have still assumed that something is being said about the human condition, life and death and a possible afterlife. But a more parochial reading could see "atoms and ifs" as the name of a Dublin church, or the name of a pub (the two were historically, and locally, connected), and so a specifically Irish destiny seems to be outlined. A local priest might well aim his admonitions at those who come from, or will resort to, the adjacent pub. The algebra of the Wake allows an equation of any public house with Earwicker's (if it is his) tavern. Remaining in the same environment, we can release more semantic energy if we split "ifs" into its atomic parts and take it for the abbreviation of "Irish Free State" (note that "free state" would also con trast with predestination): this state was clearly characterized by a precarious origin, erratic movements and clashes and schisms. We might then speculate upon the relations between national and personal freedom in the new independent state or the dominance of the church. All that this exercise is aiming at is to toy with the possibility to see a sentence also as a local Irish concern. It so happens that "if" is also French for the yew tree, which is the letter T" in the Irish alphabet. Such a Franco-Irish translation would provide, circuitously, the addition of "you" (yew) and "I" to "We" and a tree for Adam and Eve, a tree that has connotations of death and resurrection. So we can guess how an arboreal reading could take 257</page><page sequence="22">over. Or let me just mention a possible Egyptian interpretation if we allow "atoms" (following J. S. Atherton and Adaline Glasheen) to refer also to the creation God Atem: we would get a Book of the Dead ver sion of the soul's destination to supplement the Christian one. What I've been doing is simply to start from different "ifs" and try out the hypotheses with the necessary verbal adaptations and viola tions. The results are interpretative guesses, odds without end, of the kind that we have all seen. If the dramatic context of the sentence were brought in, the role of the speaker Jaun and his present strategies, still more patterns would be the outcome ("odd's," for example, would fit into the prevalent racing terminology of the passage, the human race could be connected, once more, with the circularity and imprevidibil ity of track events.) Even the isolation of one sentence shows that Fin negans Wake is multicontextual. And every interpretation also ac tivates its own doubts. Interpretations are if-propositions. And by some sort of coincidence, // in Old Norse means doubt. But we hardly need this philological gloss: doubt is present in the etymological potential of the English conjunction and, more importantly, it has been dynamically staged as a process. Why should we not take the sentence as yet one more expression of the solipsistic side of the Wake, its one perennial concern with its own being? Maybe it is talking just about itself: for Finnegans Wake does in fact come from Adam and Eve's (inverted as "Eve and Adam's" in the very first line), there are odds without end, the book is typographi cally without end. Its reading is touch and go, our understanding is often limited to its particles and, as demonstrated, very iffy. And finally let me see the sentence simply as an elaboration of what the word "odd" can imply, a semantic festival launched to illustrate its meanings. Like life, Finnegans Wake is odd, and "odd" is defined by what it is not: not regular, not even, not fitting into pre-existing categories. It accommodatingly suggests both a deficiency, a pattern to be completed, and a surplus that defies order. So it provokes us into completing the patterns, filling the void uncertainty with some prejudiced substance. We are tempted to press the Wake back into the categories which it transcends. All of the meanings that I have interpolated from the 19 words are not there: if they were, they would not have to be extracted. The meaning, perhaps, can best be seen in the extraction itself, in the constructive process. This is not new in Joyce; the narrator of "The Sisters" had already puzzled his head "to extract meaning from. . .unfinished sentences," and in reading the story we are doing something similar, making a poor best of snippets of unreliable information. In Finnegans 258</page><page sequence="23">Wake information is unreliable, incomplete and defective, and reading amounts to instant repair work in the light of what we know. For better or worse, we have to change the Wake into what it is not. Quantitatively Finnegans Wake is characterized by utter economy and extreme redundancy. As readers we have to settle for less (than, say, the exact appearance of words and phrases) and not be content with too much. We have to accept approximations, more or less ade quate (Eve out of if's) and acceptable to others. For our mental con structs we have to mis-take the verbal appearance. This wouldn't do in normal life: "if's" is not accepted for "Eve" on a legal document and we know that some readers will neither acknowledge it nor its principle. Finnegans Wake conditions us to ignore such small differences and to charge them, as well, with full meaning and to fill gaps. This restorative process is chancy. Remember that Bloom once completed an unfinished sentence by supplying a wholly correct completion: "macintosh," and this led to a tangle of identity in Ulysses. There it looks like an exception; it has become the misrule of the Wake. My main point is that our transformations are transformations, both necessary and doubtful. So I would simply argue for more care in the articulation of our observations. A little more reticence, perhaps, when we use formulas like "Finnegans Wake is. . . "; for it isn't, even if it may be useful to treat it as though it were, for the moment. As long as we know what we are doing the damage is minimal. My own parallactic reading of a single sentence is, I hope valid and, in evitably, false. Not alone in the selective bias of my perspective, but in the method itself. For I took it for granted that one atomic element is a microcosmic sample of the whole. It works, up to a point, and I can make it appear as that, but the supposition may be as hazardous as all other approaches. As doubtful as a reduction of the Wake's prolifera tion to the same old family nexus ?or to see it predominantly and drearily in terms of Joyce's letters to Harriet Weaver ?or a limitation to the sum total of all available notebook entries, etc. Falsify if you but will, simplify you must ?let us just not forget it. It is not my impression that we, Joyceans, always do signal our limita tions. We can't say that Joyce did not give us due warning. I hope I'm not mistaken as saying that we should not take a stand, should not try out even obstinately consistent interpretations, should just hem and haw cautiously and not, for example, treat Finnegans Wake as though it were really nothing but a novel. That will sharpen our observation, add new insights. The trouble is that the academic game requires formulations that are closer to the Cyclopean mode than the Bloomian or Eumaean or Wakean approach. Which makes 259</page><page sequence="24">us, to the irritated amusement of bystanders, as impressive and as pompous as Gabriel Conroy or professor Shaun. Perhaps the most adequate way would be to talk like Finnegans Wake. After all, the language of the Wake is also a perhaps imprac tical but optimal way to say something that can hold up to investiga tion. Perhaps the only true thing about life is something like "We may come, touch and go. ..." It misfits so many contexts that it cannot be entirely wrong. In Finnegans Wake Joyce may have hit upon the method to express incontrovertible truth ?to put on the process of controversion itself. In reading it one becomes an agent of controversion and, presurely, one would have to remain rather dogmad in order not to become dubliboused. NOTES ^'Bous Stephanoumenos! Bous Stephaneforos!" (P168). The Classical Lexicon for Fin negans Wake by Brendan O Hehir and John Dillon {Berkeley: Univ, of California Press, 1977) does not acknowledge any of the Greek and Latin words that I play with in the passage. The conclusion is that either the Lexicon or my remarks have to be treated with skepticism ? preferably both. As it happens, the Shem-adjective ends in what is the Latin conjunction used to introduce doubt: sed, which may mean nothing more than that the Wake conditions us to invest random elements with significance that fits the pattern we want to discover. 2Arno Schmidt, "Das Geheimnis von Finnegans Wake," in Die Zeit (16 December 1960), and Der Triton mit dem Sonnenschirm (Karlsruhe: Stahlberg, 1969), passim. 3Suzette Henke, Joyces Moraculous Sindbook (Columbus: Ohio State Univ.

When the maternal relation is finally straightened out, by means of the handbag, then, and only then, towards the end of the play, Algernon Moncrieff, the friend, is called "Algy," with the identical name that Stephen has been thinking of as he watches the two Frauenzimmer: "like Algy, coming down to our mighty mother" (U 37).
