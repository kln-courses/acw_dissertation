<plain_text><page sequence="1">WOMEN LIKE MEAT: THE FOLKLORE AND FORAGING IDEOLOGY OF THE KALAHARI JU[HOAN. By Megan Biesele. Bloomington and Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, 1993; and Johannesburg: University of Watersrand Press, 1993. Pp. 196. $29.95 cloth, $14.95 paper. Women Like Meat is a double entendre: bushman women (the compound term is used by Megan Biesele) enjoy meat, and women are akin to meat. The Juthoansi themselves make the first statement, and Biesele interprets the latter as a central metaphor in bushman thought. The coupled duality is a primary focus of the book,</page><page sequence="2">674 BOOK REVIEWS and this being established early, the reader looks forward to a fully gendered explo- ration of Ju/'hoan folldore. Who are the Jufhoansi, also called Ju/wasi, Zhu, or southern !Kung? Biesele collected tales during the period 1970 to 1972, from people living a "semi- sedentary" existence 12 miles from Tsau, a Tswana village. She situates them in a greater entity called "the bushmen," one of the quintessential ethnographic subjects/ categories of the twentieth century. Inmediately there are difficulties here, in that "they" already exist in the minds of her readers, even nonspecialist readers. Indeed bushmen have been so produced (reified would imply no independent existence) that Biesele's accessing of an internal cultural grammar must deal with the boun- daries around "them," regardless of her intent. And, if she means really to focus on bushmen as an historically figured category of people strewn across southern Africa, as she seems to in the first third of the book, she would have to ask how folldore (in its situation, frequency, choice of themes) countenanced vast historical and material changes. Overall, Biesele disappoints these expectations. The structure of the book is loose. Biesele begins with generalizations about Kalahari bushman culture. In this she acknowledges that "less than 5% of the Bushman are in situations where hunting and gathering can provide their sole sub- sistence" (p. 11). She sees the transformation to this material position as an accel- eration of normal, age-old "environmental and social changes." As it must have been for Cro-magnons, bushmen folklore still reflects "survival pressures" (p. 13). She then sets the stage for her readings of Ju/'hoan tales, although she draws even trans-continental comparisons before presenting many of them. In this section Biesele is strong when it comes to discussing performance and the meta- phorical richness of Ju/hoan speech. Her theoretical ideas, however, come from uncritical readings of Milman Parry, Albert Lord, Walter Ong, and Jack Goody, combined with a form of functionalism. Folklore is said to be "an important phase in the systematics of knowledge of hunter gatherers" (p. 43), and so the bushmen, who are mysteriously still hunter-gatherers, evolved folklore in the interest of survival. One must counter with the obvious: they have not survived as a society. Yet Biesele argues at length in this vein; for instance, the unsystematized nature of bushman lore helps people remember large amounts of information (p. 55) or practice metaphoric speech (p. 201), and so is directly and indirecdy required. Tale- tellings are "selected habits of information processing" (p. 44) about foraging life. While folktales may require "recreational contexts" to be heard, and deal in raucous, hilarious, and improbable events, they are "rational," serve "social and economic purposes," etc. (p. 45). JuIhoan foildore, then, is valorized to the academic reader simply because it represents its apparent opposite, "our own science" (p. 46). Happily, her free and insightful discussions of meaning in the tales she proffers often contradict the implications of her theories. The memorable tales have to do with G!kon//'amdima, a heroine, and Kaoxa, often her father-in-law, a trick- ster. The stories are complex, ribald, and scatalogical, and the translations careful if</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 675 literal-minded ("You big-penis"! says someone, not, "You prick!"). Ju/'hoansi often oppose images of men hunting with women giving birth or perpetuating life (e.g. with seedings of wind-born menstrual blood). Still Biesele shows that the symbology of the tales is changeful, and does not attempt to reduce it to a rigorous order. The reader more often confronts the extreme sort of antagonisms present in other anthropomorphic trickster tales, such as those of Gizo or Anansi in West Africa. Agnatically linked men attack a "wife" as a piece of game; she rejuvenates through her maternal kin and kills them. Kaoxa, in his Promethean guise, fire- brands the markings of meat animals; G!kon//'amdima acts her role as the fecund pythoness; while the duplicitous jackel stirs trouble with both of them. He suffers in the end (literally). Harmony is rarely achieved, and the world thereby changes. Ultimately the museum dust of functionalism settles on her analyses. If the fantastical metaphorical motifs surrounding the gemsbok do "form a body of factual information" (p. 97) useful for life in the desert, does this explain them? There is a larger problem, however: as she presents the folklore, its assumptions about how people survive rather seem to bypass the realities of Ju/hoan life, and certainly "bushman" life, if not since the 1960s, then at least since she left her fieldwork. Bushmen have not been hunters and gatherers in South Africa, or even Namibia, for many decades. For Namibia's bushmen, Robert Gordon has docu- mented a history of brutal exploitation, banditry and resistance, alcoholic dissolu- tion, and militarization.1 According to John Marshall, one of Biesele's close colleagues, dramatic changes came to the Ju/hoasi just as Biesele came among them. In "Nyae Nyae" in Namibia, due, inter alia, to South African resettlement policies, "as a way of life and as a base of subsistence, hunting and gathering permanently collapsed ... in 1970."2 On the other hand, in 1970 Biesele was conducting her fieldwork a hundred miles into Botswana from the Namibian border. The earlier attacks on Namibian hunter-gatherers were even then in the process of giving the border meaning, and lessening the integrity of the Ju/'hoasi as a whole. Might we then limit Biesele's conclusions to Botswana? Perhaps, but it is in Botswana that Edwin Wilmsen has argued most forcefully (anticipated by Schrire and others) that the Ju/'hoasi are not a forager ethnicity. Rather, some people have been historically marginalized into becoming foragers by larger political and economic forces. For him, "bushman" is a "class categorization," and if hunting-and-gathering is one of its features, it is so only in the desperation of poverty.3 Now, had Biesele recognized Wilmsen's work, 1 Robert J.

Wilmsen has been chastised, correctly, I think, for too much equating the marginalization</page><page sequence="4">676 BOOK REVIEWS she might have challenged it, by arguing that folktales reveal the utter centrality of hunting in JuIhoan conceptions of themselves. Unfortunately, Wilmsen never appears in Women Like Meat; neither do J. Denbow or Robert Gordon. Biesele nods only slightly to current debates. She wrote the basis of her book for her 1975 doctorate, and must have revised it unevenly in the twenty years before publication. Given her theoretical emphasis on the adaptive value of expres- sion, she then had no choice but to downplay the actual material shifts among JuJ hoansi. Sticking to the unchanging landscape of the ethnographic present, she confesses only that she knows "that ideologies lag behind new economic arrange- ments," but she cannot yet evaluate how (p. 202). This is to be regretted, since Biesele herself has played an important role in trying to stimulate cattle-keeping as a way of reempowering Jut hoasi. The effects of her stance are to be seen even in the cultural adaptations she admits. For instance, there is no explanation for the brushfire-like spread of "Beh's Song" in the 1960s. Evidently involving giraffe-miming, it replaced "gemsbok" singing "over vast areas of the Kalahari" (p. 68). Then, there is tcoqma, a secret male initiation ritual that spread throughout the northern Kalahari, around the turn of the century (n7, pp. 205-207). One wonders why it did so. Perhaps it organized age-grades of adult men in some trans-ethnic, regional fashion. Lastly, is it really true that bushman folklore is so fundamental as to help people "distinguish the correct aggressive attitudes towards the two [women and game animals]-one for killing, one for sex" (p. 190)? Or, have such lessons grown in importance, perhaps in tandem with domestic violence? In either case, one is helplessly reminded of the US arny chant distinguishing penis and gun: "one is for fighting, and one is for fun." How sad that men need to be taught this distincton the world over. PAUL S.
