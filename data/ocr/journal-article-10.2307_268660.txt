Untersuchungen zur Verwendung von r&amp;v, 7TVra, wavrEs und dergleichen als Ausdrucksmittel religioser Sprache. Hildesheim: Georg Olms Verlagsbuchhand- lung, 1965. Pp. 153. Mk. 22.80 (paper). A study of the word w&amp;v and its manifold uses is well suited to the task of defining more closely those religious beliefs represented in the tragedies of Aeschylus. The concept of omnipotence and omniscience as the all- important attribute of deity can be traced from its Homeric beginnings through the growing self-awareness of lyric to a high point in the Zeus hymns of the Suppliants and the Aga- memnon. By following the course of this development one attains a clearer picture of the Aeschylean Zeus, its debt to tradition and its originality. In Homer the 7Tiv attribute appears pre- ponderantly but not exclusively with reference to Zeus. His pre-eminence is also implicit in the</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 233 frequent juxtaposition 7TfvXes e9ot-Zevs&amp;. However, the Homeric Zeus is by no means an "Allgott"; greatest and strongest among the gods, he has not yet become that ruler of the whole cosmos to whom no other deity compares. In lyric the concept of a single all- encompassing god comes strongly to the fore. The separate individual deities of epic merge in the pale abstraction of a class, eEoc; Zeus himself becomes eEJeos, the god KXT' EeoX /V, his singularity emphasized by the addition of Ets or tuovos to 7TaV. One might be tempted to discern here in man's concept of divinity a progression parallel to that in his concept of self. The separate divine forces represented by distinct gods gradually coalesce to form a single entity characterized by wholeness; just so do the fragmented semi-autonomous organs of consciousness slowly come together until man perceives himself and his perception as a unity. He discerns a single synthesizing principle which activates the disparate areas of feeling and cognition. And similarly, he evolves a god whose unity embraces what had appeared as multiplicity before. The trend toward unity and abstraction continues in the Pre-Socratics where, how- ever, traditional hymn-like formulae are borrowed to express new modes of thought. Such formulae and the use of &amp;Tav itself as an attribute of the divine may be the result of Orphic influence. Later Orphic hymns are characterized by their emphasis on all power- ful god; from this fact and from the wide- spread dissemination of Orphic ideas in the seventh and sixth centuries Kiefner concludes that earlier Orphic hymns gave the impetus to that growing monotheistic tendency which can be traced throughout Greek literature. In this section of his book K. pays close attention to stylistic means of heightening the &amp;Tav predication and to the heightened aware- ness which such rhetorical devices imply. Occasionally his search for an Allbegriff behind each use of &amp;Tav leads him to strained conclusions. For example, the Homeric ra . .. vav-a teA'7caT appears in a variety of passages, each time closely linked to the specific situation by a neuter plural demon- strative and a dative of the person. The formula is used with reference to both gods and men. Behind these multiple occurrences K. posits an Urform which referred originally to a deity; this hypothetical protoformula reveals the concept of an "allkiummernden Gottes." In his examination of the Aeschylean Allbegriff K. has employed the following method. First, an investigation of the pre- Aeschylean background, the heritage from tradition. Next, the use of Tarv in purely secular contexts where originality of usage should be more evident. Several typical categories are distinguished: 7Tav as a proleptic formula pointing ahead to total revelation; an epanaleptic use which sums up the preceding narrative; its frequent occurrence as heighten- ing adverb or prefix. Despite K.'s promise to the contrary, this section of the work yields little that is valuable for the subsequent study of the religious concept. As "Schliissel fur aischyleische Zeus- religion" K. chooses a line from the Zeus hymn of the Suppliants, rTov-rCx -ot pAE2yEGEa (88). In this leitmotif one hears an echo of tradi- tional religious belief, of the sky god Zeus whose weapon is the thunderbolt. On the other hand, the hymn goes far beyond traditional concepts in its concern with the relation of god to man and with the incom- prehensible nature of the former. The imagery of light and dark expresses this nature at once unknowable and all-encompassing. The parodos of the Suppliants starts with the mythic figure of Zeus progenitor of the Danaids. But as it continues it transcends the myth until there emerges that god on whom all life depends. In just such a way the hymn progresses from a specific appeal for help in a particular situation to a general description of the god's power. And at the point where this general statement begins the poet's own concept of deity breaks through the words of his chorus. The anthropomorphic Zeus of myth becomes an image for that ineffable being whose totality can not be grasped by man. Conflict between the Zeus of myth and the sublime all-encompassing deity becomes most apparent in Prometheus Bound. K. emphasizes</page><page sequence="3">234 BOOK REVIEWS that this is not a conflict between two separate beliefs but rather two possible ways of viewing the same divine nature. One view is super- imposed upon the other and Aeschylus passes with ease from the first to the second, un- hampered by their seeming contradiction. For Aeschylus they coexist, this god of myth and this god beyond all categories of human comprehension. On the problem of originality in the Aeschylean concept of Zeus K. emphasizes both the poet's innovation and the dependence upon his predecessors. Aeschylus stands with- in the tradition, continuing a trend long before begun; at the same time his Zeus repre- sents a broadening and deepening of these earlier tendencies. From reading K.'s study one realizes still more clearly the fallacy of Lloyd-Jones' statement that the conception of Zeus in Aeschylus contains "nothing that is new, nothing that is sophisticated, and nothing that is profound" ("Zeus in Aeschylus," JHS, LXXVI [1956], 64). Thus the study of ir&amp;v and its manifold uses does contribute toward an understanding of Aeschylean theology. The nature of this contribution, however, is merely to confirm the obvious. As K. himself acknowledges, "Aus der Untersuchung des religiosen Allbegriffs ergibt sich der Eindruck, dass auch bei Aischylos die Vorstellung eines mono- theistischen Allgottes zum Durchbruch gelangt ... Die Forschung kam bisher, von all- gemeinen Aspekten ausgehend, ebenfalls hin und wieder auf dieses Ergebnis ... Doch wird man den besonderen Weg, auf dem wir uns bewegen und auf Grund dessen wir zu diesem Resultat gelangt sind, als weiteren Beitrage zur Frage ansehen k6nnen." One cannot deny that this book is of some interest, has some value: the scholarship is adequate, the premise safe, the result pedestrian. Is one justified in asking more from scholars? It's worth a try. ANNE LEBECK Amherst Colleze</page></plain_text>
