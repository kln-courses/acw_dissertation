Insight and Artistry in African Divination, ed. John Pemberton III. Wash- ington, DC: Smithsonian Institution P, 2000. 209 pp. ISBN 1-56098-884-3 paper. These works represent two recent and exciting contributions to the field of African literature. Abosede Emanuel's Odun Ifa: Ifa Festival is a schol- arly, informative, and unique African perspective on the richness of Ifa, a divination system of several West African peoples, especially the Yoruba of Southwestern Nigeria. Edited byJohn Pemberton III, Insight and Artistry in African Divination offers us a number of scholarly works on African divina- tion throughout the regions of West and Central Africa. As winner of the prestigious Noma award, Odun Ifa is a work of just fewer than seven hundred pages that discusses Ifa, its history, rites, and rituals, and provides an extensive sample of Ifa verses relating to the sixteen principal paired Odu of Ifa, Ifa divinatory poetry. Unlike many previous works on Ifa that have degenerated into endless lists of the same citations, quotations, and photographs, Odun Ifa provides us with a refreshingly new</page><page sequence="2">226 Research in African Literatures taste of African orality, divination, and ritual from an African perspective. It represents a number of new works coming out of Africa written by local African historians and culturalists-not academicians trained in Western universities. As an "insider," Emanuel provides us with a holistic view of Ifa that reflects the power of its historical myth, orality, and place in the Yoruba worldview. The work is divided into ten parts: an historical introduction, a discus- sion of the state of ritual and ceremonies such as the Annual Festival, an extensive look at the Sixteen Principal Paired Odu oflfa, the inaugural Odu, conjuration Odu, the casting of the kola-nuts, sacrificial rites, chants uti- lized after sacrifice, and divination itself. We see discussions of the origins of Ifa, its philosophical ideas, as well as a very extensive presentation of a large number of Ifa prayers, verses, and rites. Odun Ifa: Ifa Festival has the virtue of being part of an insider literature that captures the self-understanding of traditions. It is part of a process in which an oral tradition becomes written but not in a canonical way. This process is not new to the study of religion. We have seen faiths such as Christianity and Islam change from oral traditions and teachings to an authoritative text written down by their respective followers. In this sense, Odun Ifa is a work that is likely to be consulted for years to come. It is a work that lies at the heart of the Yoruba identity. Instead of describing the phe- nomena of Ifa, Emanuel shows us Ifa by weaving together the complexities of Ifa proverbs, beliefs, and practice. We must credit Emanuel for including both the relevant Ifa text along- side his English translation. This is crucial, since the Ifa text itself is part of the divine. In this traditional African religion, there is a kind of "reverse anthropomorphism." Key words and concepts that are associated with the gods are the product of the actual transformation of the gods into the words themselves. It is these subtleties of Emanuel's work that give it an awareness and understanding of the academic study of Ifa that few scholars have been able to achieve. Increasingly, I am confident that these emerging African contributions to African studies will become vital in developing future discourse representing African belief, practice, and traditions from African perspectives. Emanuel's Odun Ifa: Ifa Festival is an African work of exceptional excellence in the academic study of the Ifa tradition. Edited by the doyen of Yoruba arts and religion in America today, Insight and Artistry in African Divination indicates a new body of work within African studies, currently undergoing a metamorphosis of conceptual paradigms, perspectives and methodologies from both African and non- African thematic links. I am reminded, for example, of the similarity of this work with Sandra Barnes's Africa's Ogun: Old World and New (2nd ed. Bloomington: Indiana UP, 1997). There is a kind of richness of diversity not just in the selection of various types of African divination but also in the diversity of perspectives of how to interpret, understand, and respect these traditions. In any diverse portfolio of hermeneutical approaches, however, we are inevitably left with the difficult task of making choices as to what theoretical models, methodological approaches, and even themes we should adopt or accept.</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 227 African Divination contains fourteen articles addressing African divina- tion in terms of methodology and regional focuses largely centering on a variety of peoples of Central and Western Africa. In examining these very significant and well-written essays, I have some general comments in addi- tion to some suggestions for alternative approaches to African Divination's methodological contributions as well as its justification for its regional selection and individual focus. I believe firmly there must be a rationale to justify why some areas are worth consideration and others are not. The almost exclusive focus on Western and Central Africa neglects a number of significant cultures, traditions and processes of divination throughout Eastern, Northern, and Southern Africa. It is always the case that whenever we Africans focus on a general theme, as in the case of divination, we all make choices of what to include and exclude. Of course, our selection is normally biased in favor of the regions we are familiar with or where there is a reasonable amount of well-known work. Consequently, we are frequently faced with works whose samples of the African mosaic do not fully repre- sent the general African population. There must be a careful criterion to prevent bias in our publications. For example, if we were to say that the criteria for selection of peoples were to focus on Bantu peoples in Africa, we would have to include Southern Africa as well. While I find the articles in African Divination to be largely excellent, they can be generally improved in one important dimension. The largely individual focus on diviners, rituals and belief systems excludes the important reality that divination is often a communal activity and source of identity formation. In terms of this work's methodology, I believe a crosscultural approach is entirely appropriate to the comparative study of African divination prac- tices, but in our efforts to find links, we must be careful to not ignore the thematic importance of traditions of orality, place, and identity. BothJohn Pemberton III and Wyatt MacGaffery refer, for example, to the continuum of "lumpers" and "splitters" that characterize the contemporary discourse on African divination. Lumpers err on one end of the spectrum, in their emphasis on syncretism and their overgeneralization, while splitters "insist on the uniqueness of each village" (1). As a scholar of comparative religion, I should perhaps consider myself a splitter since I cannot fully accept the dispositions and assumptions of all of this work's methodological consider- ations. I agree, for example, that divination rituals often involve imagina- tion and are associated with knowing one's personal identity (5). Also, in a number of cultures, divination practices may provide a context for knowing the self as a moral agent, a truth constructing process or as evidence of ambivalent ethical connotation (4). In the case of the Yoruba divination system, divination is much more a mechanical and mathematical process that functions as a conduit to the divine. Here the gods are associated with both the good and the bad, or, as the Yoruba put it, tibi tire. According to the Yoruba, ethics, morality, and truth come from the traditions of historical myth and orality linked to the divination process. Since it is the historical myth that gives divination meaning, we must examine the unique charac- teristics of culture by comparing both the similarities and differences of that culture with others.</page><page sequence="4">228 Research in African Literatures Philip Peek's contribution provides a fundamental insight into the role of cognition within divination practices. From his work, we begin to grasp both the complexities and intricacies of West African divination practices. However, I must caution that Peek's supposition that the Yoruba's casting of palm nuts and the consultation of verses of the Ifa text represent an opposi- tion of cognitive models may not be entirely correct (26). I believe that this statement alone is indicative of a very common mistake that is made in the study of African religion between practitioners and nonpractitioners. No babaldwo would ever make such an assertion. Here Peek fails to recognize the role of the Ori. The divination process and the oral text are both part of one attempt to open the gate of knowledge. The babalaiwo recites the oral prayer before he casts the chain to invoke the spirits. This oral prayer is one with the Ifa text, since that text is part of a living oral tradition, not a written book. Many of the words in the process itself represent concepts that are believed to be the actual manifestations of the gods themselves. The diviner's usage of ritual is the means by which the diviner allows the divinity to direct him to the answers within the Ifa text. Both methods are part of a single process of cognition in which Ifa acts as the intermediary. Peek should be more forthcoming in describing his ideas of cognition. I believe he may be associating belief with the nonrational, which, if that is the case, is a fundamental mistake. It is unclear what Peek may be saying of Ifa in his description of its utilization of "culture-specific non-normal modes of cognition." I believe Peek is correct in saying that divination has a clear rational and pragmatic purpose, but we must not discount the role of belief itself. Divination is more than a process of cognition; it is also a process of social understanding and group identity, unity, and interpreting order and disorder in the world. In his methodological contribution, Wyatt MacGeffery argues that regional studies are "better than lumping or splitting." I grant him that this may be the case, but I wonder if a focus on such common characteristics as ancestor communication omits key aspects of divination that are unique to each culture. Can we ignore the importance of sacred place? For example, what would Yoruba divination be without the sacred city of Ile-Ife or the Igbo Odu, sacred forests of Ifa where the babaladwos must be revealed to the Odu, the personification of wisdom? In another essay, John Mack's contribution seeks to include the ques- tion of where lies the nexus between aesthetics and divination. Like Ulli Bier, Mack's work indicates an understanding that African art, orality, myth, and divination are part of an integrated whole. He focuses on a thematic approach that makes connections between divination, ritual, and their tem- poral and spatial environments. It reflects an understanding of divination as it can be linked to the zodiacs of astrology and the sacred centers of Africa. Finally, the methodological section concludes with Louis Brenner's fascinating essay on khatt ar-rama, or "sand-writing," as a form of geo- mancy. Brenner provides us with a detailed description of a seven hundred year tradition of divination practiced in communities from Yorubaland to Madagascar. However, the diversity of practice of this form of divination</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews 229 in both Muslim and non-Muslim communities throughout Africa does not negate the importance of "ethnographic perspectives that place emphasis on the internal coherence and even exclusivity of an ethnically or culturally defined religious practice" (57). The functionalist appeal of these practices may reflect a common acceptance that does not necessarily equate to a common culture or worldview. In developing an analysis of African divination in central Africa, the work includes six outstanding essays that examine the divination practices and tools of a number of peoples, from the slit-drum of the Yaka to the bells utilized in Pende divination. Mary Roberts, for example, in her article on the Luba diviners of the Congo/Zaire provides us with a sense of the impor- tance of orality in the story of Mbidi Kiluwe. The emphasis on Luba myth as well as on tropism and metaphor conveys an understanding of figures of speech that operate on complex and interacting forms of meaning (75). In Allen Roberts's discussion of the Tabwa people of southeastern Zaire, we hear of the Tulunga shamans and the sacred place of the Tabwa boil- ing-water oracle. Z. S. Strother, in his discussion of the Pende, proclaims that Pende beliefs in divination have changed in the last forty to sixty years. Strother asserts that Christian influence has created a shift in praying for the mediation of the dead to praying directly to a more monotheistic God as part of a growing polarization between good and evil. His emphasis on these changes reflects a needed emphasis on what are the influences of modernity, colonialism, and non-African systems upon African divina- tion. Rene Devisch's article on the Yaka of southwestern Congo/Zaire, places a strong emphasis on the voice of the Yaka slit-drum, which is in many ways reminiscent of the talking drum of the Yoruba people. Manuel Jordan's study of the Chokwe, Lunda, Luvale, and other related peoples of northwestern Zaire provides an extensive discussion of the significance of a variety of objects or tools of divination. Finally, Alisa Lagamma in her characterization of divination practices in Gabon provides us with a needed linkage between divination and healing within these societies. In the final section of the work, we see a number of articles focusing on the significance of divination within the Yoruba worldview. The one excep- tion is Lorenz Homberger's work on the mouse oracle among the Guro of the central Ivory Coast. For the Yoruba, Barry Hallen provides an analytical piece that indicates the extent to which Yoruba diviners display a remark- able intelligence, intellect, and skill in interpretation. Wande Abimbola provides a powerful and extensive description of the Yoruba cosmology, ritual, and belief. As Awise Agbaye, he is probably the best individual to state what divination's role is between continuity and change and best suited to indicate the influence of the Yoruba Diaspora upon the direction of Yoruba divination. Finally, Rowland Abiodun provides an insightful piece on Agere Ifa sculpture. His work integrates the realm of both aesthetics and divina- tion as forms of Yoruba identity, expression, and belief. --Jacob K. Olupona University of California, Davis</page></plain_text>
