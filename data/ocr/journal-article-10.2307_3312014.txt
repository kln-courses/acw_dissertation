<plain_text><page sequence="1">DYNAMIC STATUTORY INTERPRETATION WILLIAM N. ESKRIDGE, JRJt Federal judges interpreting the Constitution typically consider not only the constitutional text and its historical background, but also its subsequent interpretational history, related constitutional developments, and current societal facts. Similarly, judges interpreting common law precedents normally consider not only the text of the precedents and their historical context, but also their subsequent history, related legal developments, and current societal context. In light of this, it is odd that many judges and commentators believe judges should consider only the text and historical context when interpreting statutes, the third main source of law. Statutes, however, should-like the Constitution and the common law-be interpreted "dynamically," that is, in light of their present societal, political, and legal context.' Traditional doctrine teaches that statutes should not be interpreted dynamically. Prevailing approaches to statutory interpretation treat statutes as static texts. Thus, the leading treatise states that "[flor the interpretation of statutes, 'intent of the legislature' is the criterion that is most often cited."2 This "intentionalist" approach asks how the legis- lature originally intended the interpretive question to be answered, or ?

The implicit claim is that a legislator inter- preting the statute at the time of enactment would render the same interpretation as a judge interpreting the same statute fifty years later. This implication seems counterintuitive. Indeed, the legal realists ar- gued this point earlier in the century. For example, gaps and ambigui- ties exist in all statutes, typically concerning matters as to which there was little legislative deliberation and, hence, no clear intent. As society changes, adapts to the statute, and generates new variations of the problem which gave rise to the statute, the unanticipated gaps and am- biguities proliferate. In such circumstances, it seems sensible that "the quest is not properly for the sense originally intended by the statute, [or] for the sense sought originally to be put into it, but rather for the sense which can be quarried out of it in the light of the new situa- tion."5 Moreover, as time passes, the legal and constitutional context of the statute may change. Should not an interpreter "ask [her]self not only what the legislation means abstractly, or even on the basis of legis- lative history, but also what it ought to mean in terms of the needs and goals of our present day society[?]"' I For general explanation of the intentionalist approach, see Lehigh Valley Coal Co. v.

It uses specific examples of dynamic interpretation to show how the model works. The Article accepts the traditional assump- tions that a functioning representative democracy exists in our polity, that the legislature is the primary lawmaking body, and that in many cases statutory language will be sufficiently determinate to resolve a given case.8 Even under these conventional assumptions, however, origi- nal legislative expectations should not always control statutory mean- ing. This is especially true when the statute is old and generally phrased and the societal or legal context of the statute has changed in material ways. Part II demonstrates that no good reason compels adherence to traditional originalist doctrine. Three major types of arguments have been invoked in favor of statutory intentionalism or modified intention- alism: (1) the formalist argument that the Constitution vests Congress with the exclusive power to create law or policy, leaving courts with no role but to carry out the intent (or purpose) of Congress; (2) the eco- nomic argument that statutes are contracts between interest groups and legislatures and as such must be enforced by judges (the "agents" of the legislature) according to their original terms and intent; and (3) the legal process argument that it is illegitimate for nonelected judges to make policy in a majoritarian political system by expanding upon the original meaning of statutes. None of these arguments, however, justi- fies unexceptioned statutory intentionalism when circumstances have changed and the statutory language is not determinate. Part III describes the advantages of the proposed model of dy- namic statutory interpretation over other current approaches to statu- tory interpretation. The Article argues that this model depicts what the Supreme Court typically does when it interprets statutes and that the 456, 469 (1950). 7 This approach is related to, but stops far short of, the proposal in G. CALA- BRESI, A COMMON LAW FOR THE AGE OF STATUTES (1982), that courts ought to be able to update statutes by overruling them. Calabresi's thesis has been criticized as inconsistent with traditional assumptions about the role of courts in a representative democracy. See, e.g., Posner, Legal Formalism, Legal Realism, and the Interpretation of Statutes and the Constitution, 37 CASE W. RES. L. REV. 179, 196-97 (1987). 8 These are the traditional "pluralist" assumptions of constitutional and statutory theory, as well as those of most Supreme Court decisions. For different assumptions of republicanism and communitarianism, see Michelman, The Supreme Court, 1985 Term-Foreword: Traces of Self-Government, 100 HARV. L. REV. 4 (1986) and M. SANDEL, LIBERALISM AND THE LIMITS OF JUSTICE (1982), respectively. These politi- cal theories would be consonant with an even more dynamic, current policy approach to statutory interpretation.</page><page sequence="4">1482 UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 135:1479 model's descriptive power is superior to that of the models traditionally invoked by the Court-intentionalism and the progressive modified in- tentionalism of Henry Hart's and Albert Sacks's legal process materi- als." I do not contend that the model here is always, or usually, easier to apply than the intentionalist or modified intentionalist approaches. I only contend that it explains the results of the Supreme Court's cases better and is a more candid analysis of what the Court does. Finally, the Article contrasts my dynamic interpretation model with the more ambitious approach posited by Professor Ronald Dworkin. Dworkin, too, argues for dynamic interpretation, in which statutes change as "law's integrity" develops and changes. My approach is more cautious and conventional than that of Dworkin. He envisions judges perform- ing the truly herculean task of reading magisterial coherence into the law.'0 I envision judges as diplomats, whose ordering authority is se- verely limited but who must often update their orders to meet changing circumstances. I. A MODEL OF DYNAMIC STATUTORY INTERPRETATION The static vision of statutory interpretation prescribed by tradi- tional doctrine is strikingly outdated. In practice, it imposes unrealistic burdens on judges, asking them to extract textual meaning that makes sense in the present from historical materials whose sense is often im- possible to recreate faithfully. As doctrine, it is intellectually antedilu- vian, in light of recent developments in the philosophy of interpreta- tion.1' Interpretation is not static, but dynamic. Interpretation is not an archeological discovery,'2 but a dialectical creation. Interpretation is not mere exegesis to pinpoint historical meaning, but hermeneutics to apply that meaning to current problems and circumstances. See H. HART &amp; A. SACKS, supra note 4, at 1287-1380. 10 See R. DWORKIN, supra note l, at 239; R. DWORKIN, A MATTER OF PRINCI- PLE 316 (1985) [hereinafter A MATTIER OF PRINCIPLE].

Alexander Aleinikoff suggested to me the idea that traditional stat- utory interpretation is like an archeological expedition. He compares the "archeological metaphor" with a "nautical metaphor," in which Congress turns the statute out to sea and leaves it to drift unpredictably.</page><page sequence="5">1987] DYNAMIC STATUTORY INTERPRETATION 1483 The dialectic of statutory interpretation is the process of under- standing a text created in the past and applying it to a present problem. This process cannot be described simply as the recreation of past events and past expectations, for the "best" interpretation of a statute is typi- cally the one that is most consonant with our current "web of beliefs" and policies surrounding the statute."3 That is, statutory interpretation involves the present-day interpreter's understanding and reconciliation of three different perspectives, no one of which will always control. These three perspectives relate to (1) the statutory text, which is the formal focus of interpretation and a constraint on the range of interpre- tive options available (textual perspective); (2) the original legislative expectations surrounding the statute's creation, including compromises reached (historical perspective); and (3) the subsequent evolution of the statute and its present context, especially the ways in which the societal and legal environment of the statute has materially changed over time (evolutive perspective). Under dynamic statutory interpretation, the textual perspective is critical in many cases. The traditional understanding of the "rule of law" requires that statutes enacted by the majoritarian legislature be given effect, and that citizens have reasonable notice of the legal rules that govern their behavior." When the statutory text clearly answers the interpretive question, therefore, it normally will be the most impor- tant consideration. Exceptions, however, do exist because an apparently clear text can be rendered ambiguous by a demonstration of contrary legislative expectations or highly unreasonable consequences.", The his- torical perspective is the next most important interpretive consideration; given the traditional assumptions that the legislature is the supreme lawmaking body in a democracy, the historical expectations of the en- 13 Cf.

'4 Moore, A Natural Law Theory of Interpretation, 58 S. CAL. L. REV. 277, 313-18 (1985), posits six "rule of law" values that should inform a natural law theory of interpretation. These are boiled down to the two mentioned in the text. They rest upon assumptions that might readily be questioned. See, e.g., Parker, The Past of Con- stitutional Theory-And Its Future, 42 OHIO ST.

Hence, when a clear text and supportive legislative history suggest the same answer, they typi- cally will control. The dynamic model, however, views the evolutive perspective as most important when the statutory text is not clear and the original legislative expectations have been overtaken by subsequent changes in society and law. In such cases, the pull of text and history will be slight, and the interpreter will find current policies and societal condi- tions most important. The hardest cases, obviously, are those in which a clear text or strong historical evidence or both, are inconsistent with compelling current values and policies. The remainder of this Part will illustrate how dynamic statutory interpretation works and will conclude with a cautious model of dy- namic interpretation. Recent Supreme Court cases will be used to demonstrate the intuitive cogency of my multiple-perspective approach and to suggest instances where an originalist approach is not sensible. Indeed, the Court often manipulates originalist arguments to reach re- sults that can better be supported by a dynamic view of the statute. The first example draws upon an old, generally phrased statute, for which a dynamic approach is strikingly different from the traditional approach. Consider the difficulty the Court had in squeezing a sensible result out of the traditional approach. Section 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871,16 codified at section 1983 of title forty-two of the U.S. Code, provides that persons who subject others to "the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immuni- ties secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress."17 The Supreme Court, in Smith v. Wade,'8 decided whether punitive damages could be recovered under section 1983 by a prison inmate who was injured after being placed in a cell with danger- ous inmates, allegedly in reckless disregard of the plaintiff's safety. The Court held that punitive damages could be awarded in such a situa- tion;19 the two dissenting opinions argued that punitive damages could only be awarded upon a showing that the defendant had acted with actual intent to injure the plaintiff prisoner.2 Neither the majority nor 16 17 Stat. 13 (1871) (current version at 42 U.S.C. ? 1983 (1982)). 17 Id. 18 461 U.S. 30 (1983). 19 Id. at 34-56. 20 Justice Rehnquist, joined by Chief Justice Burger and Justice Powell, argued in the primary dissent that "a forthright inquiry into the intent of the 42d Congress and a balanced consideration of the public policies at issue compel the conclusion that the proper standard for an award of punitive damages under ? 1983 requires at least</page><page sequence="7">1987] DYNAMIC STATUTORY INTERPRETATION 1485 the dissenting opinions found decisive support for their views in the generally worded text or in the legislative history of the statute. Nonetheless, the basic clash between the majority opinion and the primary dissenting opinion in Smith v. Wade was argued in terms of the intent of Congress in 1871. Both opinions relied on the common law rules of punitive damages existing in 1871, assuming that most of the members of Congress were attorneys who would have expected that the common law would fill any gaps in the statute.2' The majority opinion cited dozens of nineteenth century state cases in which punitive damages were awarded and in which the state court suggested that "wanton" or "reckless" behavior could justify such damages.22 The pri- mary dissenting opinion responded with dozens of nineteenth century state cases seeming to require "actual malice" or "spite" to justify pu- nitive damages.23 While the Justices' excursions into these historical materials is in- teresting, they are of little relevance to the best interpretation of the statute. To begin with, the battle of the string citations is indeterminate because there are plenty of cases to support either point of view. In- deed, if the members of the forty-second Congress had been aware of the several hundred opinions cited by the Court and the primary dis- sent in Smith v. Wade, my guess is that they would have been confused and without any "intent" pertaining to this issue. Furthermore, the analysis in both opinions appears basically ahis- torical and result-oriented. The opinions misperceived the common law in 1871 by focusing on the defendant's state of mind. This is a focus that had crystallized by the end of the nineteenth century in tort law and criminal law. But in the third quarter of the century, tort theory was struggling with subtly different issues. For example, the debate in the 1850s and 1860s was whether punitive damages were allowable in some degree of bad faith or improper motive on the part of the defendant." Id. at 56 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). Justice O'Connor's dissent, while agreeing with Justice Rehnquist's conclusion, rejected his analysis. She argued that no clear congressional intent was discernible. Her disagreement with the majority opinion was based on her concern with the "special problems" of permitting awards of punitive damages for the recklessness of public officials. See id. at 94 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). 21 See Briscoe v. LaHue, 460 U.S. 325, 330 (1983); City of Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., 453 U.S. 247, 258 (1981). While this maxim of interpretation is not a consistently reliable guide for divining "legislative intent," it may be particularly ap- propriate for construing ? 1983, because the statutory language explicitly refers the injured party to "an action at law" for damages or "a suit in equity" for injunctive relief and, hence, suggests a formal legislative reliance on existing common law or equi- table remedies. 22 See 461 U.S. at 35 nn.3-4 (punitive damages awarded generally), 39 n.8 (puni- tive damages awarded for wanton or reckless behavior), 45 n.12 (same). 23 See id. at 60 n.3, 78 n.12 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).</page><page sequence="8">1486 UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 135:1479 tort cases at all. The majority rule by 1871 was that such damages were permissible if a defendant's conduct were especially outrageous.24 Thus, those jurisdictions allowing punitive damages justified the "ex- tra" recovery mostly on the "oppressive" conduct of the defendant, rather than on the defendant's state of mind.25 Finally, the historical analysis-to the extent it supports any inter- pretation of the statute-supports what is in my view the wrong inter- pretation. Under an "outrageous conduct" test the jailer's conduct in Smith v. Wade probably does not justify punitive damages. Indeed, a court in 1871 might not have considered the jailer's conduct to have been sufficiently outrageous to have justified even compensatory, let alone punitive, damages.26 Consequently, had the Supreme Court wanted to freeze the meaning of section 1983 at its time of origin, the result in Smith v. Wade would have been different. A dynamic approach to section 1983 would not stop with the his- torical perspective, especially when the historical evidence is indirect and confusing and the statute is old. The interpreter would ask herself what interpretation is most consistent with section 1983 as it has evolved over time. Indeed, in Smith v. Wade Justice O'Connor refused to join either the primary dissenting opinion or the majority opinion, finding their discussions of history "unilluminating."27 Instead, she considered the current policy context of section 1983. All too briefly, she explained that two current policies conflicted: the policy to deter official wrongdoing versus the concern that overdeterrence would both chill officials from vigorous exercise of their discretionary responsibili- ties and overburden the courts.28 I applaud Justice O'Connor's skepti- cism about the usefulness of the historical perspective here and endorse her focus on the current mix of purposes in the statute.

I should go one step beyond Justice O'Connor's dissenting opinion and ask whether modern common law provides interpretive guidance. In fact, the opinion for the Court in Smith v. Wade fleetingly men- tioned the current common law rule that reckless misconduct can justify punitive damages.29 This is the only persuasive authority invoked by the majority opinion, for the common law rule represents a well-consid- ered modern consensus about when the imposition of punitive damages is appropriate.30 Reliance on evolving modern common law to fill in statutory gaps, moreover, is consistent with the methodology the Court has used in other cases interpreting section 1983. In fact, Professor Seth Kreimer has demonstrated that in determining remedies, immunities, and other issues under section 1983, the Court typically does not un- dertake "a search for century-old legislative intent or common law con- text"; instead it creates "a federal common law that the Court regards as appropriate to modern social and political realities."'31 This funda- mental point, that a federal common law approach is sensible, is sup- ported not only by the general, non-confining language of section 1983, but also by the substantial changes in the societal and legal context of section 1983. Section 1983 was a congressional response to state-sanctioned abuse of civil rights in the South during the Reconstruction.32 Its enact- ment aroused a flurry of activity, but it soon fell into disuse because it was narrowly interpreted to provide a remedy only when official action was sanctioned by state law. In Monroe v. Pape,33 however, the Su- preme Court interpreted section 1983 to provide a remedy for official actions not sanctioned by state law. This interpretation exemplified the Warren Court's commitment to civil rights cases in the 1950's and 29 461 U.S. at 46-47 (quoting RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS ? 908(2) (1979)). 30 Modern law also supplies the majority's best response to the current policy argument asserted in Justice O'Connor's dissent. The Supreme Court held in Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323, 349 (1974), that punitive damages could be asserted in defamation cases when there was proof of "knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth." The Court's concern in Gertz that punitive damages might chill the exercise of critical first amendment rights suggests that a more restrictive punitive dam- ages rule would not be appropriate for ? 1983. 31 Kreimer, The Source of Law in Civil Rights Actions: Some Old Light on Sec- tion 1983, 133 U.

This commitment, of course, was not just to the civil rights of blacks in the South, but also to the rights of criminals, inmates of pris- ons and mental hospitals, and others. The explosion of constitutional tort litigation that followed Monroe forced the Court to fill in the many gaps in section 1983: who can be sued, what remedies are available, which statute of limitations is applicable, and so forth. The modern common law of tort remedies and immunities is a convenient way to fill in these gaps. Moreover, it is a sensible way because it reflects the accumulated wisdom of incremental judicial doctrine-building in a related field. Yet, as Justice O'Connor's dissent in Smith v. Wade reminds us, the common law gap-filling rules should be modified when appropriate to fit the Court's ongoing policy- balancing within the context of section 1983 litigation. Given the com- mitment in the last thirty years of the Court and our society to deter civil rights violations by officials, the common law punitive damages rule should not be relaxed in the context of section 1983. Smith v. Wade is a particularly dramatic case calling for dynamic interpretation. The evolutive perspective is critical for two reasons. First, the language of the statute gives the Court a great deal of free- dom in interpreting it; this makes the textual perspective of little im- portance. Second. the statute's interpretation and the needs and values of society have changed substantially since the enactment of the statute. These developments render the historical perspective less persuasive. Had the statute been recently enacted and filled with detailed policy prescriptions or expectations reflected in its legislative history, a dy- namic interpretation would not differ much from originalist statutory interpretation. The language of the statute would answer most of the interpretive issues, and national policy values would have changed lit- tle, if at all. Nevertheless, some recent statutes have evolved so quickly that dynamic interpretation offers a richly different perspective from that of traditional theory. Consider the following case. In United Steelworkers v. Weber,34 the Supreme Court addressed the question of whether Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 196435 permits employers and unions to adopt voluntary affirmative action plans. Brian Weber, a white employee, sued his union and employer for entering into a collective bargaining agreement that included an af- firmative action plan to redress the underrepresentation of blacks in the employer's skilled workforce. The plan that Weber challenged reserved fifty percent of the spots in the company's craft-training program for ." 443 U.S. 193 (1979). -31 78 Stat. 253 (1964) (current version at 42 U.S.C. ? 2000e (1982)).</page><page sequence="11">19871 DYNAMIC STATUTORY INTERPRETATION 1489 blacks. Weber argued that this penalized whites and effectively "dis- criminated" against them on the basis of race, in violation of Title VII. A divided Court rejected Weber's interpretation. While the Court's de- cision is the proper one, the Court had great difficulty justifying its result under traditional theories of statutory interpretation. The statutory text does not decisively answer the interpretive is- sue, contrary to labored readings by both the majority and dissenting opinions.36 Section 703(d) makes it an unlawful practice for an em- ployer or labor organization "to discriminate against any individual be- cause of his race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in admission to, or employment in, any program established to provide apprenticeship or other training."37 The operative word is "discriminate," which is not defined in the Act. Weber interpreted the antidiscrimination rule of section 703(d) to prevent any and every differential treatment of em- ployees on racial grounds. This interpretation is plausible. It is also plausible to interpret the antidiscrimination rule to penalize only dis- crimination which is invidious, for the term "discrimination" in com- mon usage means something more than just different treatment.38 Other provisions of Title VII might shed some light on the mean- ing of "discrimination," of course.

This supports Weber's interpretation; if section 703(d) only prevented invidious discrimination, there would be no need for a seniority defense, and the italicized proviso would be un- 11 See 443 U.S. at 204-06 (majority opinion), 220-222 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). 87 78 Stat. 255-56 (1964) (current version at 42 U.S.C. ? 2000e-2(d) (1982)).

See 443 U.S. at 226 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). For instance, if Congress really wanted a sweeping protection against any and all differential treatment, it might have made any failure by the employer to include any individual in any program estab- lished to provide apprenticeship or other training as a result of prohibited criteria, namely race, an unlawful employment practice.

On the other hand, Title VII also addresses the affirmative action issue in specific terms. Section 703(j) provides that the Act does not "require any employer . . . to grant preferential treatment to any individual or to any group because of the race" of that individual or group.4' That the provision does not say "permit or require . . . pref- erential treatment" lends some support to the union's interpretation of Title VII.41 On the whole, I consider the textual arguments inconclusive; good arguments can be made for either position. Title VII was obviously not drafted with a coherent vision of discrimination in mind,42 and the fact remains that the statutory text never defines "discriminate." The his- torical perspective provides some, but not decisive, guidance for solving the interpretive puzzle. There was a great deal of discussion of "quo- tas" in the legislative debates; supporters of the civil rights bill repeat- edly assured opponents and undecided legislators that the statute would not mandate racial quotas. The dissenting opinion in Weber meticu- lously recounted these debates and argued that the statutory "deal" was that there would be no mandatory or voluntary quotas.43 This is far 40 78 Stat. 257 (1964) (current version at 42 U.S.C. ? 2000e-2(j) (1982)) (em- phasis added). 41 The Court's opinion treats this argument as a decisive textual response to the dissenting opinion's textual analysis. See 443 U.S. at 204-08. I do not consider the argument at all decisive, for it rests upon the highly unreliable maxim of statutory construction "inclusio unius est exclusio alterius" (inclusion of one means exclusion of the other). See, e.g., Herman &amp; MacLean v. Huddleston, 459 U.S. 375, 387 n.23 (1983) (rejecting application of the expressio unius maxim because such a presumption would undermine the purpose of the 1933 Securities Act); National Petroleum Refiners Ass'n v. FTC, 482 F.2d 672, 676 (D.C. Cir. 1973) (stating that the "[expressio unius] maxim is increasingly considered unreliable"); cf. Hishon v. King &amp; Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 78 &amp; n.1 1 (1984) (applying the expressio unius theory only where the Court found a detailed, carefully considered list of exemptions, from which one item was notably absent). It is also an implausible view of ? 703(j), which was added to attract conservative support for the civil rights bill in the Senate. See 110 CONG. REC. 12688- 12691 (1964) (Sen. Saltonstall). The conservatives, such as Senator Dirksen, did not want to broaden the civil rights bill at all; ? 703(j) was a narrowing provision, if anything. 42 Indeed, Title VII went through many different stages. President Kennedy's ini- tial job discrimination provision was weak. The House subcommittee strengthened it with a broad mandate against discrimination based on race, religion, and national ori- gin. See C. WHALEN &amp; B. WHALEN, THE LONGEST DEBATE 37-38 (1985). It pro- vided for enforcement by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The full House Judiciary Committee weakened the job discrimination title by cur- tailing the powers of the EEOC, but retained the forceful prohibition against "discrimi- nation" on the basis of race, religion, and national origin. See id. at 57-58. The full House amended ? 703(a)(1), (d) to prohibit sex discrimination-obviously a very dif- ferent type of problem from race discrimination. The Senate added ? 703(h), (j).

Ronald Dworkin has cogently</page><page sequence="13">19871 DYNAMIC STATUTORY INTERPRETATION 1491 from clear, however, because nowhere in the legislative history does any member of Congress explicitly state opposition to both voluntary and mandatory affirmative action programs. This is not surprising, as the debates focused on government-compelled quotas. The Weber situation was not discussed on the public record and most likely was not anticipated. The majority opinion largely ignored the intentionalist evidence assembled by the dissenting opinion and countered with a modified in- tentionalist argument: the purpose of Title VII, set forth in the House Judiciary Committee report, was to obtain more jobs for blacks." That purpose was thwarted in the 1970's by the continued effects of past discrimination. To fulfill this statutory purpose, the Court reasoned it should broadly validate voluntary affirmative action programs such as the plan in Weber. This argument, however, subordinates one purpose of Title VII-obtaining more jobs for blacks-to another-creation of a color-blind society.'5 Two central purposes of the statute conflict in the Weber case, and the Court offered no persuasive justification to prefer its purpose over the competing one. While there is much more evidence relating to the historical per- spective in Weber than there is in Smith v. Wade, the evidence points in many different directions. In my opinion, the historical perspective tilts toward Weber's interpretation, because the legislative history reveals hostility to quotas generally and because the purpose most broadly accepted in Congress was that of creating a color-blind soci- ety.46 Hence, if I limited my consideration to the textual and historical criticized Justice Rehnquist's use of legislative history in A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE, supra note 10, at 316, 324-26.

The Civil Rights Act barely beat back the Southern Democratic filibuster in the Senate (by a vote of 71 to 29, four votes more than the required two-thirds majority), and only with the support of Senator Dirksen and about a dozen other Republican conservatives.

It is inconceivable to me that these Senators, as well as some of the Demo- crats voting to invoke cloture, would have favored a bill that permitted, and even en- couraged, voluntary affirmative action plans. With regard to the legislative purpose, the theme that dominated the debates was equality of opportunity and the creation of a color-blind society. The only purpose for which there was substantial congressional consensus was the creation of a color-blind society.

Nevertheless, I agree with the Weber Court's result because of the evolutive perspective. The separate concurring opinion of Justice Blackmun is the most sensible opinion in the Weber case. Justice Blackmun argued that the evolution of Title VII created a practical dilemma for unions and employers that justified voluntary affirmative action in many cases.47 My dynamic interpretation of Title VII would start with this insight and broaden it to include our changing concept of discrimination. An assumption of most supporters of Title VII in 1964 was that equality of opportunity for minorities would in due time yield equality of result in employment. As the statute was implemented by the courts and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), however, it became apparent that formally equal opportuni- ties were not always leading to significantly greater representation of minorities in the workforce.48 American society came to understand that the invidious effects of discrimination might last long after the discrimi- nation itself ceased and that more affirmative measures were needed to afford any reasonable chance for a color-blind society in the future.49 Consequently, there was greater pressure on employers and unions to undertake voluntary efforts to re-evaluate their employment practices; the Supreme Court strongly encouraged such voluntary efforts in the 1970's. 0 Once the most blatant forms of discrimination were eliminated, the EEOC and other enforcers sought to eliminate more subtle forms of discrimination, such as facially neutral job classifications which had the effect of excluding minorities. The Supreme Court in Griggs v. Duke 47 443 U.S. at 209-16 (Blackmun, J., concurring). Justice Blackmun's concur- rence is largely drawn from the opinion of Judge Wisdom, who dissented from the court of appeals decision reversed by the Weber Court, 563 F.2d 216, 227 (5th Cir. 1977) (Wisdom, J., dissenting). 48 The facts of Weber illustrate this problem. Even though the employer claimed it did not discriminate against blacks, the craft workforce remained only 1.83% black into the 1970's, in large part because one qualification for becoming a craft worker was prior experience, which blacks did not have, arguably due to past discrimination. See 443 U.S. at 197-99. 49 Cf. University of California Regents v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265 (1978) (majority of the Court approved state affirmative action but not quotas). 80 See Franks v. Bowman Transp. Co., 424 U.S. 747, 778-79 (1976) (noting that employers may retroactively alter seniority plans to ameliorate the effects of past dis- crimination); Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U.S. 36, 44 (1974) ("Congress . . . provide[d] . . . the [EEOC] . . . authority . . . to promote voluntary compliance with the requirements of Title VII."). For a recent example of the Court's commitment to this value, see Firefighters v.

This decision un- derscored the idea that results matter,52 but also generated a practical dilemma for companies seeking to comply with Title VII. Even if they were not treating blacks and other minorities differently from white males, companies and unions-like those in Weber-faced potential Ti- tle VII liability if the numbers of blacks and other minorities in their workforce remained too low. Given the Supreme Court's endorsement of voluntary programs, the natural response was voluntary affirmative action programs such as the one in Weber. This dynamic approach to the Weber problem is particularly per- suasive because it recognizes not only that the very nature of the prob- lem had changed since 1964, but also that the legal and societal context of Title VII had changed. In 1964, the legal culture-legislators, judges, administrators, and commentators-focused on how to root out discrimination inspired by racial animus. People thought that rooting out actual prejudice would create a color-blind society. The intellectual focus changed over the next fifteen years, as the legal community came to realize that discrimination could be just as invidious even when it could not be established that prejudice was at its root. The concept of the continuing effects of historical patterns of discrimination suggested that current institutions might perpetuate discrimination even though no one in those institutions remained personally prejudiced. This in- sight was not a historical concern of the 1964 Act, but it evolved into a current concern and was recognized in subsequent statutes, judicial de- cisions, and commentary.53 Indeed, the legal culture's rethinking of the concept of discrimina- tion has entailed a more positive vision, in which voluntary affirmative "' 401 U.S. 424 (1971). 62 Although the Griggs Court reaffirmed the color-blind purpose of Title VII, the rationale for the decision was a shift of emphasis: "The Act proscribes not only overt discrimination but also practices that are fair in form, but discriminatory in operation * . . .Congress directed the thrust of the Act to the consequences of employment prac- tices, not simply the motivation."

Employers may desire to implement affirm- ative action for reasons unrelated to their own past discrimina- tion-including a desire to promote workplace or societal diversity as a positive good or to improve service or to appeal to minority communi- ties." Weber subserves this positive vision as well, and in the 1986 Term the Court applied Weber expansively to permit forward-looking affirmative preferences for women as well as racial minorities." Justice Stevens (concurring in each case) suggested that the Court's decisions could not be justified by reference to Congress's historical intent or pur- pose in enacting Title VII but that the results were still justified by the evolution of the statute and Weber."6 Weber suggests a lesson: when societal conditions change in ways not anticipated by Congress and, especially, when the legal and consti- tutional context of the statute decisively shifts as well, this current per- spective should, and will, affect the statute's interpretation, notwith- standing contrary inferences from the historical evidence. The harder question is whether the evolutive perspective should be similarly per- suasive in the face of more determinate statutory language. This prob- lem poses the possible clash between the "rule of law" values of the textual perspective and the justice values of the evolutive perspective. Consider in this regard Firefighters Local Union No. 1784 v. Stotts,"7 the next important interpretation of Title VII by the Supreme Court. In Stotts a black firefighting captain in Memphis brought a Title VII class action against the City's Fire Department. The case was set- tled with the entry of a consent decree in 1980, which agreed to quotas for hiring and promoting blacks over a period of time. When, in 1981, the City was forced by budgetary concerns to lay off firefighters, the district court modified the consent decree to enjoin the layoff of black employees-who tended to be recent hires-thereby bumping some more senior white employees. The Sixth Circuit affirmed this modifica- tion,"8 but the Supreme Court reversed, based upon two provisions of Title VII. The Court relied primarily on section 703(h), which makes it lawful "for an employer to apply different standards of compensa- "4 See Sullivan, The Supreme Court-Comment, Sins of Discrimination: Last Term's Affirmative Action Cases, 100 HARV.

It appears to protect good faith seniority arrangements against disruption pursuant to Title VII. Any doubt about its meaning is erased by the legislative history, which indicates that the provision was put in the statute to protect workers' seniority rights against court- ordered remedies.60 Although it detracts from the overall thrust of the statute, both in 1964 and thereafter, section 703(h) was part of a legis- lative compromise which protected the expectations of workers. Under conventional assumptions, courts are supposed to enforce such policy choices when they are clearly made by the legislature after a delibera- tive process. Hence, the evolutive perspective must yield where the text and evidence of legislative expectations support another interpretation. As an alternative basis for its holding, the Stotts Court also relied on section 706(g), which authorizes injunctions against discriminatory practices and "such affirmative action as may be appropriate," includ- ing reinstatement, hiring, back pay, "or any other equitable relief as the court deems appropriate." The last sentence of section 706(g) pro- vides that reinstatement and other "make whole" remedies are not available to individuals suffering injury "for any reason other than dis- crimination"' in violation of Title VII.61 The Stotts Court interpreted section 706(g) to deny court-ordered affirmative action relief, based largely upon the statements in the legislative history that Title VII would not authorize court-ordered quotas."2 The Court's interpretation is defensible under the historical perspective for the same reasons the Weber dissent is. But it is not compelled, or even much supported, by the text of the statute: "individual relief suits" under Title VII can seek only "make whole" relief for victims of discrimination. A fair implica- tion from the text is that "class action lawsuits" such as the one in Stotts may seek race-conscious affirmative relief, for that may be the most "appropriate" remedy.63 Indeed, the broad language "any other equitable relief as the court deems appropriate" was added by Congress to section 706(g) in 1972 after careful deliberation over, and rejection of, Southern objections that courts had gone too far in ordering affirma- tive action relief under Title VII.64 Hence, the Court's reliance on sec- I" 42 U.S.C. ? 2000e-2(h) (1982).

Even if the historical record were less clear, the position of the Stotts dissenters that section 706(g) allows flexible judicial relief is compellingly supported by the evolution of Title VII and the changed circumstances outlined above.06 The three perspectives implicated in dynamic interpretation illus- trated by these cases suggest a continuum. In many cases, the text of the statute will provide determinate answers, though we should trust our reading of the text primarily when the statute is recent and the context of enactment represents considered legislative deliberation and decision on the interpretive issue. This is one end of the continuum: the text controls. At the opposite end of the continuum are those cases where neither the text nor the historical context of the statute clearly resolves the interpretive question, and the societal and legal context of the statute has changed materially. In those cases, the evolutive context controls. In general, the more detailed the text is, the greater weight the interpreter will give to textual considerations; the more recent the stat- ute and the clearer the legislative expectations, the greater weight the interpreter will give to historical considerations; the more striking the changes in circumstances (changes in public values count more than factual changes in society), the greater weight the interpreter will give to evolutive considerations. The following model very roughly reflects this continuum. No. 92-261, ? 706, 86 Stat. 103, the Senate rejected an amendment by Senator Ervin to prohibit government requirements of hiring goals or quotas. Senator Javits defended the existing judicial and executive policy of flexible relief, including hiring goals.

JUSTIFICATION FOR READING STATUTES DYNAMICALLY My central proposition is that statutory interpretation is influ- enced by the ongoing, not just original, history of the statute. There are three types of arguments that have been advanced in favor of a static view of statutory interpretation. All three arguments ultimately appeal to the Constitution's concept of separate powers. The formalist argu- ment is that the creation of law by federal judges is beyond the author- ity given them in the Constitution, for it trenches upon the lawmaking power given to Congress. The economic argument is that statutes are essentially contracts between interest groups and legislators, with fed-</page><page sequence="20">1498 UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 135:1479 eral judges being no more than agents to enforce those contracts strictly. The traditional legal process argument is that such judicial lawmaking is "countermajoritarian" and so ought to be avoided in a democracy, where important policy decisions ought to be made by the majoritarian branches of government. I shall articulate and respond to each of these arguments in turn, but there are certain themes which run through all my responses. One theme is a Madisonian view of the Constitution. Historical scholarship suggests that our constitutional system of government was not meant to be one of rigid separation of powers or pure majoritarianism.66 Instead, the polity created by the Constitution requires a government that is deliberative and promotes the common good, at least on important mat- ters. Judicial lawmaking from statutes has a constructive role to play in such a polity, especially in light of the tendency of the legislature to produce too little up-to-date public-seeking policy and not to produce well-integrated policies. The vision of a tripartite government and the legitimacy of the system are not served by a straitjacketed theory of statutory interpretation but are better served by a flexible approach that is sensitive to current policy concerns. The final theme is jurispru- dential. Interpretation is no longer automatically seen as an objective and mechanical process of "discovering" historical meaning; instead, the emerging view among historians, literary theorists, and legal schol- ars is that interpretation itself inevitably involves the "creation" of meaning from the interaction of the text, historical context, and evolu- tive context. A. The Formalist Argument When the Supreme Court interprets statutes, it often invokes a strict formalist-sounding separation of responsibilities among the three branches of government, with the role of courts merely being to discern and apply the "intent" of the legislature. Professor Thomas Merrill has recently synthesized the Supreme Court's ad hoc approach and has presented a more systematic formal defense of intentionalist statutory interpretation.68 In brief, his argument is that the Constitution's sepa- " This interpretation of Madison's view of the Constitution is discussed in D. EPSTEIN, THE POLITICAL THEORY OF THE FEDERALIST 145-46 (1984); see also Sun- stein, Madison and Constitutional Equality, 9 HARV. J.L. &amp; PUB. POL'Y 11, 13-15 (1986). "I See R.

CHI. L. REV. 1</page><page sequence="21">1987] DYNAMIC STATUTORY INTERPRETATION 1499 ration of powers gives all lawmaking power to Congress and none to the federal courts and that intentionalism is the only mode of statutory interpretation that is consonant with this constitutional division of functions."9 This is an unusually strong statement of the formalist argument, because it denies courts any lawmaking functions. Indeed, the most striking thing about the argument is how little support it derives from the text and structure of the United States Constitution. Nowhere does the Constitution say that Congress shall have all lawmaking power. It only says, in article I, that "[a]ll legislative Powers" shall be vested in Congress and, in article III, that the "judicial Power of the United States" shall be vested in the Supreme Court and whatever inferior courts Congress might create.70 The commonly accepted meaning of "legislative Powers"-in 1789 as well as today-is the power to enact statutes, which can override the common law that is part of the "judi- cial Power."'71 The specification in article III, section 2 of what the "judicial Power" might encompass supports the view that the Framers assumed federal courts would have common law-making powers. The first para- graph of section two lists nine areas of federal jurisdiction, and only one of those areas of potential federal jurisdiction, "Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties," explicitly contemplates that federal statutes would define the substantive rights of the parties.72 The Supreme Court was. vested with original jurisdiction over two of these categories, that is, "Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, and those in which a State shall be a Party,"73 with the implicit power to make law to resolve these disputes. In practice the Court in its original juris- diction cases has deferred to relevant federal statutes but has often cre- (1985). 6f9 Id. at 3, 19, 32-33. 70 U.S. CONST. arts.

For example, "Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction"" had traditionally been governed by English judge-made law before American independence, and there is no reason to believe that the Framers intended to reject the traditional approach.78 "Contro- versies to which the United States shall be a Party" 77 might involve federal statutory law, but it is unlikely that the Framers expected Con- gress to regulate all aspects of federal government affairs, such as gov- ernment contracting.78 Even "Controversies . . . between Citizens of different States" "7 were considered to be appropriate occasions for fed- eral judicial lawmaking in the nineteenth century.80 Merrill disapproves of much of this lawmaking by federal courts or explains it away as "preemptive,""' but the fact remains that the structure of the Constitution, the apparent expectations of the Framers, and two hundred years of Supreme Court practice establish the author- ity of federal courts to make law, subject to legislative override.82 Nor does this undercut the constitutional precept of "separation of powers." The Framers' conception of separation of powers was inspired in large 74 See, e.g., United States v. Maine, 106 S. Ct. 951 (1986) (interpreting the doc- trine of "ancient title").

Indeed, they paid little attention to judicial encroachment on legislative power gener- ally, because "the judiciary, from the nature of its functions, will al- ways be the least dangerous to the political rights of the Constitution; because it will be least in a capacity to annoy or injure them."87 For these reasons, Merrill's articulation of the formalist argument for intentionalist statutory interpretation is not persuasive. The formal- ist argument, however, does not have to deny federal courts all law- making powers. A weaker statement of the formalist argument would simply posit that the Framers and their contemporaries generally agreed that when a statute, not the common law, is at issue, the "judi- cial Power" is limited to "giving effect to the will of the Legislature."88 I believe this to be a more persuasive version of the formalist argument, but it only supports the proposition that the federal courts must respect statutory language, not the broader proposition that the courts must always replicate the original intent, or purpose, of the legislature. My response to this weaker version of the formalist argument rests upon historical, comparative, and jurisprudential analysis. 83 See D. EPSTEIN, supra note 66, at 127-33. 84 See C. MONTESQUIEU, THE SPIRIT OF THE LAWS, Book XI, ch. VI (1765), quoted in THE FEDERALIST No. 47, at 302 (J. Madison) (C. Rossiter ed. 1961). 86 THE FEDERALIST No. 47, at 302-03 (J. Madison) (C.

The Historical Response The irony of modern formalism is that in limiting statutory inter- pretation to seeking out original legislative intent, it substitutes late nineteenth century assumptions for those that the Framers would have intended to guide the "judicial Power." Intentionalist statutory inter- pretation is probably not what the Framers had in mind when they defined the "judicial Power" in article JJ."89 Educated lawyers in 1789 would have considered statutory texts binding on courts, but would not have dogmatically argued that statutory interpretation involves nothing more than divining the intent of the legislature. The evidence suggests, moreover, that the Framers were no more intentionalist than their contemporaries. Sir William Blackstone's Commentaries describe judges as "depos- itories of the law," whose job is to "determine not according to his private judgment, but according to the known laws and customs of the land; not delegated to pronounce a new law, but to maintain and ex- pound the old one."9" While Blackstone did not fully appreciate the creative role of judges, neither did he advocate slavish devotion to origi- nal legislative intent. He urged that "the most universal and effectual way of discovering the true meaning of a law, when the words are dubious, is by considering the reason and spirit of it . . . [f]or when this reason ceases, the law itself ought likewise to cease with it.""9 While Blackstone refused to allow courts to substitute their judgment for that of the legislature, even when the legislature has "positively en- act[ed] a thing to be done which is unreasonable," he did allow judges "to expound the statute by equity" to reject unreasonable consequences "where some collateral matter arises out of the general words" of the statute.92 To the extent that Blackstone had a theory of statutory inter- pretation, it was that judges should enforce the textual commands of statutes, though not to the detriment of the statute's overall purposes and the current demands of equity. That theory is closer to my model of dynamic interpretation than it is to any original intent approach. Several of the influential Framers of the Constitution were at least as flexible as Blackstone in their approach to statutes. Alexander Ham- ilton went beyond Blackstone in The Federalist No. 78 in favoring a 89 As I did above in the discussion of the formalist model, I assume here that a formalist who believes we should interpret statutes to find original intent would inter- pret the Constitution to find its original meaning. 90 1 W.

Hamilton further contended that every- one ought to support such judicial power, because "no man can be sure that he may not be tomorrow the victim of a spirit of injustice, by which he may be a gainer today" and "every man must now feel that the inevitable tendency of such a spirit is to sap the foundations of public and private confidence.""' As William Blatt has recently demonstrated, Anglo-American ap- proaches to statutory interpretation in the late eighteenth century were heavily influenced by equitable factors, including the doctrine of changed circumstances.9" It was not until the second half of the nine- teenth century that the formalist approach-the role of a court inter- preting a statute is only to divine and apply legislative intent-became the prevailing doctrine. This was part of a general shift in Anglo- American law that emphasized the importance of will and choice. Just as scholars and judges redefined punitive damages in tort and criminal prohibitions in terms of malicious "intent," so legislative scholars rede- fined statutory interpretation as a search for legislative intent. In short, the formalist argument for strictly intentionalist statutory interpretation is ultimately not grounded in any constitutional vision held by the Framers. Rather, it reflects constitutional theory that was fashionable a hundred years later, and which has little persuasive power for our soci- ety today. 2.

Indeed, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, European civil law systems were even reluctant to vest courts with the power to interpret statutes.97 By the late nineteenth century, the rhetoric of stat- utory interpretation in civil law countries was strongly intentionalist.98 Over time, however, the civil law has recognized three instances in which interpretation is not a search for legislative intent. The first in- stance is the "unclear statute," where neither the statutory text nor its legislative history provides a determinate answer. The second instance is "lacunae," or gaps in the statute's coverage.99 The civil law codes typically instruct judges to interpret unclear statutes and fill in statu- tory lacunae by looking to analogous statutory rules, general principles of the state's legal order, and the justice or equity of the case.100 The third instance is the "anachronistic statute," whose meaning changes in response to significant changed circumstances."'0 "A law, especially if it is old, need not be interpreted in the spirit with which it was con- ceived," but instead may "be rejuvenated by an interpretation con- forming to the spirit of the times in which it is to be applied," accord- LESER, GERMAN PRIVATE AND COMMERCIAL LAW: AN INTRODUCTION 58-64 (1982) (T.

France, in the early nineteenth cen- tury, gave courts the power to interpret statutes subject to correction by a quasi-admin- istrative tribunal of cassation. By the end of the century, both states mitigated their formalism and gave courts the power to interpret statutes, subject to review by a higher court. See J. MERRYMAN, supra note 96, at 39-41. 98 Typical was the rule found in the Italian civil code, "Interpretation of Statutes: In applying the statutes, no other meaning can be attributed to them than that made clear by the actual significance of the words . . . and by the legislative intent."

MERRYMAN, supra note 96, at 43-47. 100 The Italian civil code further provides: "If a controversy cannot be decided by a precise provision, consideration is given to provisions that regulate similar cases or analogous matters; if the case still remains in doubt, it is decided according to the general principles of the legal order of the State."

Such statutes must be liberally adapted to "realities and exigencies of modern life," and con- strued consistently with "sane reason and a natural spirit of justice."'102 The actual practice of civil law judges has been somewhat less open-textured than the "evolutive" interpretation urged by the com- mentators, but they have been willing to read general statutes dynami- cally when societal or legal circumstances have decisively changed. A recent example is the liability of manufacturers for defects in their products.103 Civil code provisions traditionally have imposed liability on the manufacturer only if the manufacturer had been negligent or if there had been privity of contract between the victim and the manufac- turer. As the legal community rejected such restrictive ideas of manu- facturers' liability, the judges in several of the civil law countries rein- terpreted the relevant code provisions to ease the victim's burden of proof.104 Thus, article 823 of the German Civil Code imposes tort lia- bility on a defendant who "unlawfully injures the life, body, health, freedom, property or any other right."""6 German courts long inter- preted culpability as negligent or intentional conduct by the defendant, and negligence as the want of due care that a reasonable person would exercise in a given situation. The German Bundesgerichtshof reinter- preted article 823, paragraph 1, in the celebrated "fowl pest case," holding that in products liability cases there would be a presumption of negligence if the product were defective.106 The court justified its deci- sion as evolutive interpretation: even though there was an applicable code provision whose original intent and purpose were clear, a more modern interpretation was needed to do justice in a growing number of cases. 107 102 1 H.

The Jurisprudential Response The historical and comparative analysis developed above suggests a third response to the formalist argument. Intentionalist statutory in- terpretation has not been the product of the separation of powers idea; both the Framers in 1789 and modern civil law commentators have envisioned a system of separate powers, with legislative supremacy, but have contemplated dynamic interpretation of statutes to adapt to changed circumstances. Instead, intentionalist statutory interpretation has been the product of the "mechanical jurisprudence" of the late nineteenth century.108 Mechanical jurisprudence posits that law consists of rules promulgated by the sovereign legislature and mechanically ap- plied by judges. The conception that the legislature has a specific "in- tention" on a wide range of interpretive questions, and that courts "ob- jectively" determine that intention, is central to mechanical jurisprudence.109 Therefore, a central problem with intentionalist rhetoric is that subsequent jurisprudence in both the United States and Europe has rejected the assumptions of mechanical jurisprudence and, concomi- tantly, liberated judges to read statutes dynamically. The sociological and legal realist movements of the early twentieth century rejected the divorce of law from policy associated with mechanical jurisprudence and, more importantly, delegitimated the essential metaphors of inten- tionalist statutory interpretation.110 To a substantial extent, the metaphor of judge as cipher has been replaced with the vision of a creative lawmaker whose judgment in "hard" statutory cases, where the statutory text does not answer the question determinately, rests in large part on the judge's subjective views of the statute and the justice of the particular case. In 1920, Judge Benjamin Cardozo confessed that the nature of the judicial pro- cess is "uncertainty" rather than objective answers, and that "the pro- cess in its highest reaches is not discovery, but creation.""'

Max Radin argued that the concept of a single "will" for a collective body is incoherent and, in any event, is not even necessary for a thor- oughgoing formalism."3 According to Radin, the constitutional task of the legislature is not to have a "will," but only to write statutes, which are then interpreted and applied by judges and administrators to spe- cific circumstances.114 Statutes are instruments of social policy, not ends in themselves, argued Radin. Other thinkers of the period developed the insight that percipient statutes, those responsive to genuine social and economic needs, would have an expansive influence on society and the common law itself.115 The criticisms made by the legal realists are accepted widely to- day. Scholars from a variety of viewpoints agree that the idea of legisla- tive intent is incoherent and that judges have substantial lawmaking discretion in applying statutes."'6 But the realists were not successful in replacing the obsolete theory of statutory interpretation with a modern one. Radin himself proposed that statutory interpretation should start 112 "[I]n truth, all the Law is judge-made law.

Where the text does not provide a clear answer, the court should determine what "mischief" the legislature had targeted in passing the statute and then should interpret the statute to attack that mischief as it is manifested under current circumstances.'17 The approaches to statutory interpretation suggested by the legal realists and their intellectual relatives, the legal process thinkers,"18 demonstrate that respect for the Constitution's separation of powers, with Congress as the supreme lawmaking institution, does not philo- sophically or logically compel courts to adhere strictly to intentionalist statutory interpretation. Indeed, developments in the new "jurispru- dence of interpretation" of the last two decades decisively undermine the coherence of the formalist argument for intentionalist interpretation and support my dynamic model. For the hard cases, interpretation will inevitably be affected by the current context of the Judicial interpreter, and the greater the distance between the current and the historical con- text of the statute the more unlikely it is that intentionalist interpreta- tion is even possible."9 Earlier in the century, the legal realists attacked intentionalist or literalist interpretation of legal texts by invoking the indeterminacy of language, especially the concept-oriented terms, such as "malice" or "discrimination," favored by statutory drafters.'20 If the drafter's con- 11 Radin, A Short Way with Statutes, 56 HARV.

Even more troubling for the formalist vision is the critical importance of the interpreter's context, which is emphasized by the new jurispru- dence of interpretation."' "A sentence will never mean exactly the same thing to any two different people or even the same thing to one person on different occasions," argue some authors. "Meaning is shaped by the apperceptive mass of understanding and background that an individual brings to bear on the external fact of a sound or series of marks."'22 A young black schoolteacher raised in Mississippi would approach the statutory issues in Weber differently than an elderly white doctor, not only because of different political biases, but because of dif- ferent life experiences, education, and generational influences. Modern humanistic scholarship inspires this insight. A persuasive, though still controversial, body of modern aesthetic theory rejects the concept that a text has a single "true" meaning and posits that meaning is constructed by the interaction of readers and text. One leading theo- rist, Hans-Georg Gadamer, has argued that interpretation of a histori- cal text involves a "fusing of horizons," in which the reader reaches out to the past perspective, understanding that her present context condi- tions her comprehension of that text.123 Gadamer and subsequent crit- ics further emphasize that interpretation of a canonical text is an ongo- ing dialectical process. Interpretation is a contemporary interpreter's dialogue with the text and with the tradition that surrounds it.124 problems such as ambiguity, metaphor, and vagueness inescapable). 121 For examples of this new jurisprudence, see Abraham, Statutory Interpreta- tion and Literary Theory: Some Common Concerns of an Unlikely Pair, 32 RUTGERS L.

Taking Gadamer's theory several steps further, Stanley Fish, in Is THERE A TEXT IN THIS CLASS? 94 (1980), argues that readers are not "passive and disinterested com- prehenders of a knowledge external to them" and are "at every moment creating the experiential spaces into which a personal knowledge flows." 124 D.

Biblical scholarship (which inspired some of these modern literary theorists) distinguishes between "exege-</page><page sequence="32">1510 UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 135:1479 This contextual literary theory finds its complement in the histori- ographical model of dynamic historical interpretation advanced, in dif- ferent formats, by Professors Edward White125 and William Nelson.126 These scholars suggest that facts about the past are without meaning until they are woven into a story by the historian. Thus, in choosing which facts to emphasize and how to interpret them, the historian will often make choices based upon factors extrinsic to pure research. Al- though history is continuously refined through testing hypotheses against the facts, the story it tells will be decisively influenced by the "meta-theories," the overarching views of the world, held by the historian. Although debated in their respective disciplines, these theories of subjective interpretation represent a growing academic consensus127 that different interpreters over time are likely to interpret the same text differently. Smith v. Wade illustrates this point. The authors of the majority opinion and the primary dissenting opinion were amateur his- torians who read the same text and historical evidence. Yet they wrote vastly different stories about the punitive damages rule in 1871. Each author seems sincerely committed to his different story. The different intellectual and personal perspectives of the interpreters themselves probably account for the differing positions. My own account of the history (which I think is a more sophisticated account) is similarly in- fluenced by theories of torts and criminal law that I believe, my own evolutionary concept of history, and perhaps an iconoclastic desire to deconstruct a Supreme Court opinion and its main dissenting critique. Even the moderate form of contextualist interpretation theory is fatal to the formalist argument for originalist statutory interpretation. It denies the possibility of consistent and objective interpretations of the same statute by different judges-or even by the same judges under different circumstances. On the other hand, moderate contextualism does not assert that the interpreter is entirely unconstrained. One inter- pretation can still be "better" than another,'28 because it is more con- sistent with the historical or evolutive perspectives, or with both. In sis," the discovery of a text's historical meaning, and "hermeneutics," the application of the text to current problems and circumstances. 125 See White, supra note 121, at 569. 128 Nelson, History and Neutrality in Constitutional Adjudication, 72 VA. L. REV. 1237, 1240-45 (1986). 127 The literary theories of H. Gadamer and F. Kermode, see supra notes 11, 67, 123-24, fall between the views of authorial intent of E.D. Hirsh in THE AIMS -OF INTERPRETATION (1976) and VALIDITY OF INTERPRETATION (1967) and the un- bounded contextualism of the deconstructionist theory articulated by J. Derrida in OF GRAMMATOLOGY (G.

TWade, the narrowness of the debate between the majority and dissenting opinions is striking. Both contemporary common sense and the interpretive his- tory of section 1983 precluded the dissenting opinions from arguing that punitive damages were not available or that prison inmates could not sue under the statute at all, although perfectly good originalist ar- guments could have been made for each proposition. B. Economic Arguments In addition to the new jurisprudence of interpretation described above, another school of legal philosophy has contributed to theories of statutory interpretation: law and economics. In a seminal article, Professors William Landes and (now Judge) Richard Posner argued that if one assumes the Constitution embodies a simple economic/inter- est group vision of government, the independent "judicial Power" in article III can be justified as the efficient enforcement mechanism for legislative deals.130 Their argument is as follows. An economic theory of legislation posits that statutes are essentially "contracts" between in- terest groups and Congress. Congress passes laws in return for pay- ments in the form of campaign contributions, votes, bribes, and promises. "In short, legislation is 'sold' by the legislature and 'bought' by the beneficiaries of the legislation.""13 If statutes are contracts, en- forcement becomes a problem. In a private market, contracts are en- forced by legal sanctions or the threat of invoking them. In the market for public contracts-statutes-the role of the independent judiciary is to assure interest groups that their statutory bargains will be fulfilled. This guarantees the "stability . . necessary to enable interest group politics to operate in the legislative arena." The bottom line, therefore, is that "an independent judiciary" which enforces statutes according to 129 See Schauer, Easy Cases, 58 S. CAL. L.

Judge Frank Easterbrook has argued from this model that "public interest statutes" should be liberally inter- preted, while "private interest statutes," the vast majority of the laws passed by Congress, should be narrowly confined to their express terms.133 Judge Posner has argued from this model that the job of courts is in most instances "imaginative reconstruction" of the legisla- ture's probable intention.134 Professor Jonathan Macey has argued from a revised economic model of legislation (which posits as the goal of government the creation of public-seeking policy, not the ratification of private deals) that courts should interpret statutes to subserve their original purposes."'8 The economic theory of legislation does not preclude my dynamic model of statutory interpretation, in part because the assumptions of the theory limit its applicability in our constitutional system. The Con- stitution, both originally and as it has evolved, contemplates that stat- utes will represent something more than transactions between interest groups and the Congress. Within its own assumptions, moreover, the economic theory of legislation supports dynamic statutory interpretation of "common law statutes" such as section 1983.136 Since all statutes are common law statutes to some extent, economic theory should not pre- clude dynamic statutory interpretation. Finally, even under a rigorous economic theory that treats statutes as contractual deals, courts should have the power to update the deal to adjust to changed circumstances. 132 Landes &amp; Posner, supra note 130, at 878-79.

The Constitution Commits Our Polity to Deliberative Government That Promotes the Common Good, Not Just the Enforcement of Private Deals The Landes and Posner model of statutory interpretation is a thought experiment that makes the explicit assumption that the Consti- tution sanctions interest group government.'37 Historians continue to debate whether the Constitution embraces an interest group form of government. But it is now the prevailing view that the Constitution does not embody a classical "liberal" vision of government as nothing more than the arena where interest groups fight their battles.'38 For decades, historiographical analysis focused on Charles Beard's thesis that the Constitution was itself a result of special interest "cap- ture" of American government and hence implicitly ushered in the modern special interest government.189 The specific Beard thesis is a dead issue, and the focus of debate has shifted to delineate exactly what visions of law and society divided those who favored the Constitution, the Federalists, and those who opposed it, the Anti-Federalists. The "consensus historians" of the 1950's argued that the Federalists and Anti-Federalists agreed about most issues and came from similar socio- economic backgrounds,'40 and scholars in the 1960's and 1970's have 137 Landes &amp; Posner, supra note 130, at 894 &amp; n.36; cf.

What divided the groups ideologically was how to foster public virtue. The Anti-Federal- ists believed that the vices of corruption and faction could be rooted out by local government through education and moral reformation, while the Federalists believed that these evils could not be eliminated, but only controlled by the structural features of a national government. The Federalist position is most intelligently explored in Madison's The Federalist No. JO.'42 Madison's concern in the essay is control of "factions," which he defined as "a number of citizens, whether amount- ing to a majority or minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community."'43 Factions, therefore, include both pluralist interest groups and republican collections of passionately concerned citizens. Their potential evil is their threat to individuals, a concern of liber- alism, and their threat to the public good, a concern of republicanism. Unlike the Anti-Federalists, Madison did not believe education and civic activity would reduce a democracy's tendency to factionalism, be- cause the causes of faction are rooted in human nature. Instead, Madison contended that the best way to avoid control by temporary factions is to diffuse power among the three branches of government, including the two chambers of the legislature, and to extend the sphere of representation at the national rather than the state level.

Often legislation will represent nothing more than the triumph of faction. But the aspiration of the Constitution is that government do more than merely acquiesce to the demands of powerful factions. The Constitution expects that government will be deliberative, thereby compelling factions to consider the interests of others and the public welfare, and will at least occasionally rise above factions to implement and expand the common good. Ackerman's vision of a Constitution that contemplates both liberal and republican traditions not only is historiographically superior to a simple interest group view of the Constitution, but also has current descriptive value. It reconciles two distinct scholarly traditions that ana- lyze legislation. While many statutes are little more than private inter- est compromises, or even deals,146 most cannot be so narrowly defined. Descriptive political studies of Congress strongly dispute any simple interest group model of legislation. John Kingdon and other scholars have argued that normally the central participants in the legislative process are not private-seeking interest groups, but are instead public- seeking participants-the President and the Cabinet, agencies and bu- reaucrats, legislators and their staffs, academics and experts, the media and public opinion, and political parties.'47 A recent empirical study indicates that the influence of interest group pressure on federal legisla- tion ranges from "insignificant to determinative."''48 144 Id. at 80, 82-84. 145 Ackerman, supra note 138, at 1020-31; see Macey, supra note 4, at 243-44. 146 See, e.g., E.E.

On the one hand, even when interest group theory accurately describes the legislative process (statutes are private deals), the prevailing normative theory of the Constitution suggests that statutory interpretation is not limited to the enforcement of such deals and ought to have a public- seeking thrust. On the other hand, it is apparent that interest group theory does not adequately explain many statutes. For the statutes that were enacted after a deliberative process, subsequent judicial interpre- tation should continue the process of deliberation and development of the common good embodied in the statute, since the common good changes over time. For example, the Civil Rights Act went through unusually thoughtful and public-seeking deliberation before it became law in 1964.149 The Supreme Court's dynamic interpretation of Title VII in Weber continued the government's commitment to the public values in Title VII in light of changed circumstances that threatened to undermine those values decisively. 2. In a Government Seeking the Common Good, Economic Analysis Requires Dynamic Statutory Interpretation In recent works, Judge Posner endorses the idea that statutory in- terpretation in our constitutional system often cannot be limited to in- tentionalism. Thus, generally worded statutes such as the Sherman Act and section 1983 are not governed by his principle of imaginative re- construction of the legislature's intent and should be interpreted to achieve the most reasonable results in light of current policy.150 Judge Posner has suggested three reasons for reading such generally worded statutes dynamically. First, there is often not enough information to choice theory to explain the legislative process are Farber &amp; Frickey, The Jurispru- dence of Public Choice, 65 TEX. L. REV. 873 (1987), and Mashaw, Positive Theory and Public Law (Feb. 1986) (Rosenthal Lectures, Northwestern University Law School). 149 See generally W. ESKRIDGE &amp; P.

Reconstructing the historical intent of a relatively recent statute, as in Weber, is difficult enough; where the statute is very old and circumstances have changed dramatically, as in Smith v. Wade, it is well-nigh impossible. Second, the broad phrasing represents an im- plicit delegation of lawmaking authority to the courts; just as Congress explicitly delegates lawmaking responsibilities to administrative agen- cies, so it implicitly delegates similar lawmaking freedom to courts when it enacts generally worded common law statutes.151 Most re- cently, Judge Posner has suggested a third reason for reading statutes such as the Sherman Act dynamically: it makes sense as a matter of policy.152 Courts would not only fail in the effort to reconstruct the original intent and purposes of the Sherman Act, but the national econ- omy would surely suffer as a result of any serious attempt to imple- ment the original legislative expectations. When Congress has basically dropped a problem into the collective judicial lap, with imprecise and only general directions, then it makes sense for courts to develop that statute in accordance with contemporary, rather than purely historical, policy. I suggest, first, that these reasons for more flexible interpreta- tion cannot be limited to generally worded statutes and, second, that this final reason is a powerful economic argument for dynamic inter- pretation in general. These reasons apply not only to common law statutes such as sec- tion 1983 and the Sherman Act, but also to more detailed statutes such as Title VII. Congress's failure to define "discriminate" in Title VII permits-indeed, calls for-just as much judicial creativity as its prohi- bition of "restraints of trade" in the Sherman Act. In both instances, Congress has set forth general policy and has left courts substantial freedom to adapt the general language to changed circumstances. Title VII is, in that sense, a common law statute. The difference between Title VII and the Sherman Act is mainly the degree to which the statu- tory text limits judicial creativity: the very old, generally phrased text of the Sherman Act places few limits on courts, while the more recent text "'1 See R. POSNER, supra note 3, at 288. I find this reason less than completely satisfying. One searches in vain through the legislative history of ? 1983, for example, for any suggestion that Congress thought it was delegating enormous law-creating pow- ers to courts. Contemporary treatises on statutory interpretation as of 1871 mention no such implied delegation. See 1 W. BLACKSTONE, supra note 71, at 63-70, 85-88; T.

Because most statutes have common law features, they need not be interpreted with strict regard to original legislative intent even under Judge Posner's approach. Indeed, Judge Posner's recently articulated third reason for inter- preting common law statutes dynamically implicates broader policy reasons. Specifically, a "transactional model" of the legislative process suggests that the market for statutes is a poorly functioning one. Given the inherent problems with the legislative process and our polity's con- stitutional commitment to the common good, statutes ought to be inter- preted dynamically. Consider the peculiar "market" for legislation.'63 The degree and nature of interest group organization and activity-the demand pattern in our statutory market-is determined by the perceived incidence of costs and benefits of legislation. Widely-distributed benefits, such as the protection afforded by the criminal laws or section 1983, do not often stimulate the creation of interest groups in favor of such legislation be- cause each beneficiary has only a small stake in the benefit and hence will not bestir itself to invest time, energy, or money to obtain the bene- fit. Beneficiaries who do seek such legislation through collective action will be subject to the "free rider problem," in which they create public goods from which noncontributing beneficiaries cannot be excluded. The existence of this problem will further discourage groups from forming around the issue, and legislation will not be systematically de- manded. For similar reasons, legislation with widely distributed costs, such as incremental increases in taxes or inflation, will usually not in- vite group formation to oppose such legislation. In contrast, the exis- tence of concentrated costs or benefits-taxes or subsidies falling upon smaller and well-defined groups of actors-will tend to promote inter- est group formation, because each cost payer or beneficiary has a sub- stantial stake in the outcome and has greater incentive and opportunity to coordinate its efforts with those similarly situated. The receptiveness of legislators to these demand patterns-the supply pattern in our statutory market-is determined by the risks taken and by the benefits accruing to the legislator. The primary moti- vation of the legislator is to be reelected.164 Therefore, she will try to 16 The following simplified synthesis of transactional analysis of legislation is drawn from M.

She will prefer "non- conflictual" demand patterns. Thus, the legislator will want to do noth- ing when there is no organized demand for legislation, especially if there is organized and informed opposition. Unhappily, the legislator cannot always avoid conflictual demand patterns, either because an is- sue is politically salient, or because an organized group is lobbying strongly. In that event, she has every incentive to delegate final deci- sions to another entity, the bureaucracy or the courts, or to adopt a compromise solution that makes concessions to various groups.

From a utilitarian perspective, the public interest or public senti- ment laws that are generally worded should be interpreted dynamically. By interpreting such laws in light of current policy, rather than historic intent, courts enable those statutes to grow and develop in response to novel fact situations and significant changes in the legal terrain. Since Congress cannot be expected to amend and update such statutes very often (because demand is spotty), courts can serve a useful role by in- terpreting such statutes to deal with new circumstances. For slightly different reasons, more detailed, special interest statutes should also be interpreted dynamically. Just as Hamilton urged that courts should "mitigat[e] and confin[e] the operation" of "unjust and partial laws"'58 by construing them narrowly, so courts can, and ought, to mitigate spe- cial interest laws by interpreting them in light of current societal needs and evolving legal policy. For example, courts have read liberalized procedural rules into old regulatory statutes, changing the original leg- islative "bargain" in response to changed circumstances and legal val- ues.1" Indeed, under an economic approach the real issue in Weber is not whether the original legislative "deal" contemplated voluntary af- firmative action programs, but whether such programs really do con- tribute to the integration of minorities into our economic system.160 3. Even If Statutes Were Transactions, They Should Be Interpreted Dynamically in Some Circumstances Thus far I have not accepted the economic metaphor of statutes as contracts, in large part because the metaphor slights the value-creating 157 See A.

Unlike conventional contracts, the writing of a statute involves a variety of different parties, ranging from the President to private groups to staff members to the legislators themselves. Statutes run without term (in fact most statutes never expire), whereas contracts by their terms or by mutual expecta- tion expire after a period of time. Similarly, statutes are often wholly open-ended, inviting litigation and further interpretation. Only a poorly drafted contract leaves as many open terms as a statute often does. Fi- nally, unlike conventional contracts, statutes are inherently subject to unilateral revision and repeal. Because of the peculiar nature of statutory "contracts," the tradi- tional rule of contract interpretation, which instructs the court to apply the contract terms and the intent of the parties, is inadequate. For ex- ample, if section 1983 were a contract entered into a hundred years ago between Uncle Sam and his tenants-in-chief, The People, I doubt that a court interpreting the contract today would find sufficient defintion of the original intent of the contracting parties in its terms. To answer most questions of contract interpretation, the court would, in fact, con- sider current policy and practice through a series of what Professor Richard Stewart has called "suppletive rules":162 (1) The contract might be updated by looking to current "usages of trade" generally, or "courses of dealing" specifically adopted by the parties.1"3 (2) The gen- eral obligations of "good faith" and "unconscionability" would protect against hundred-year-old terms that are no longer considered reasona- ble.164 (3) The contract might be cancelled or reformulated if perform- ance had been rendered "impracticable" by the existence of contingen- 161 See Tribe, Constitutional Calculus: Equal Justice or Economic Efficiency?, 98 HARV.

I note here the internal incoherence of any argument that favors intentionalist statutory interpretation based on the premise that statutes are like contracts. Whereas the intent of the legislature is critical to statu- tory interpretation, the governing intent in a contract is the mutual intent of the con- tracting parties. 163 See U.C.C. ? 2-208 (1977); RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS ?? 222-23 (1981). 164 See U.C.C. ?? 1-203 (duty of good faith), 2-302 (avoidance of enforcing un- conscionable terms) (1977); cf.

This becomes even more striking when one considers a better contract analogue-the consent decree.168 Like a statute under the transactional approach, the consent decree is negotiated between one or more private actors and one or more public actors. Like a stat- ute, the consent decree endures for a long or indeterminate period of time, until it is withdrawn or amended, and must normally be accom- panied by a public justification and object. Also, like a statute under my model of dynamic interpretation, the consent decree can be changed by the court, over the objections of a party, to reflect changed circum- stances.'69 Consent decrees exemplify dynamic interpretation because they often result in an ongoing process of revision to address new problems. While the analogy to the consent decree may support the evolutive character of statutory interpretation, it also highlights what I believe is the central lesson of the economic theory of legislation: respect for re- cent legislative compromises. A court has very broad discretion in modi- fying a Sherman Act or section 1983 consent decree to reflect changed circumstances because the statutes are generally worded. But, as Stotts indicates, a court is more constrained in modifying a Title VII consent decree, because the statute is filled with detailed compromises such as 165 See Aluminum Co. of Am. v.

There is a distinction in the case law between "interpreting" and "modifying" a consent decree. The Court has favored an originalist approach for interpreting the "four corners" of a consent decree, see United States v.

C. The Countermajoritarian Difficulty with Reading Statutes Dynamically A legal process objection to dynamic interpretation is suggested by the "countermajoritarian difficulty" that the late Alexander Bickel raised in connection with judicial review."7' Although some of the Framers and subsequent scholars have tried to slide over the difficulty by characterizing judicial review as nothing more than the assertion of the constitutional superiority of "the power of the people" over the "will of the legislature,'"172 the fact remains that it is a nonelected judge asserting lawmaking power over the duly elected representatives of the people. Even though Bickel did not claim that the Republic was in imminent danger because of active judicial review and did not tie his argument rigorously to a vision of the Constitution, his argument was persuasive because it articulated the anxiety remaining from the dis- credited period of Lochnerian judicial review.'73 Bickel's challenge to the "legitimacy" of judicial activism was based upon his view that ac- tivist judges may thereby be substituting their own "personal values" for legislatively determined values. This is inconsistent with our soci- ety's fundamental commitment to democracy. Bickel's concerns may apply to statutory interpretation that slights the original value choices of the legislature. The countermajoritarian difficulty, however, ought not to be the basis for rejecting a cautious model of dynamic interpretation such as that set forth here. For exam- ple, when there has been a significant change in circumstances, the countermajoritarian difficulty presents slight justification for continuing to treat old statutory majorities as decisive and controlling. Addition- ally, other political values, apart from majoritarianism, are important in our constitutional polity. The legitimacy of government is ultimately 170 See Stotts, 467 U.S. at 576 n.9. 171 "The root difficulty is that judicial review is a counter-majoritarian force in our system." A.

Under this view of legiti- macy, the constructive role of courts in interpreting statutes by refer- ence to current problems and policies can be quite substantial. This is not to say that the judge's role will be overwhelming. Given the incre- mental, precedent-oriented nature of the judicial process and the availa- bility of statutory correction of judicial errors, there are some assur- ances that dynamic statutory interpretation will not undermine the correctional operation of our representative government. 1. Is Dynamic Statutory Interpretation Significantly Countermajoritarian? In defending his thesis that courts should have the power to over- rule statutes, just as they overrule common law decisions, Professor (now Dean) Guido Calabresi has analyzed several responses to the countermajoritarian concern.'74 While I find none of the responses completely dispositive of that concern, they do effectively minimize it and suggest that my cautious model of dynamic interpretation is not significantly countermajoritarian. One response analyzed, but not endorsed, by Calabresi is that non- constitutional judicial treatment of statutes is only conditional, for it may be "corrected" by legislative action.'75 This argument seems intui- tively inconsistent with the primacy accorded legislative policy mak- ing. 71 More importantly, the possibility of legislative correction is not a true majoritarian check because it is not regularly invoked. Political theory and experience suggest that because of the many procedural ob- stacles to legislation in our bicameral committee-dominated Congress, the tendency of interest groups to block rather than advance legislation, and the deference that legislators and their staffs will typically give to virtually any decision of the Supreme Court, such legislative correction will rarely occur.'77 For example, most Americans probably did not 174 G.

Any proposal to do so would be highly conflictual, with intensely interested groups on either side of the issue, giving members of Congress substantial incentives to avoid taking stands on minority rights issues.179 Even if a bill to overrule Weber had majority support in Congress, it would probably face insur- mountable procedural obstacles.180 Whatever the preferences of a ma- jority of the country, or even of the Congress, a statute overruling Weber is highly unlikely. In short, legislative inertia means that only occasionally and ad- ventitiously will Congress respond to judicial statutory interpretations at odds with original intent or purpose.""1 As Calabresi suggests, this reality leaves the countermajoritarian difficulty unsolved, but amelio- rated: judicial lawmaking power only shifts the "burden of inertia" during the 1970's). 178 A 1984 public opinion survey showed very little support for affirmative action.

FIORINA, supra note 154, at 40-49 (legislators seeking re-election have disincentive to tackle controversial issues and great incentive to devote time to pork barrel legislation and constituent services). 180 In the House of Representatives, the Chair of the Judiciary Committee which would have jurisdiction over the bill (liberal Democrat Peter Rodino, who represents a district that is predominantly black) would intensely oppose such a bill and could effec- tively kill it by refusing to bring it up for consideration or by assembling a coalition to vote the bill down in committee. Even if it got out of the Judiciary Committee, it could die in the Rules Committee, whose liberal chair (Claude Pepper) could similarly stall action indefinitely. In the Senate, even if the Judiciary Committee (chaired by liberal Joseph Biden) reported such a bill, the Democratic leadership (Robert Byrd and Alan Cranston) would be reluctant to bring the bill to the floor. If the bill made it to the floor, the liberals could kill it by extended debate (the filibuster, which the liberals borrowed for their own agenda from the conservatives of the 1960's).

A second response, accepted by Calabresi as the best solution to the countermajoritarian difficulty, is that judicial lawmaking is justified by "the subservience of courts to principles, to rational decisionmaking, and to the whole fabric of the law."'83 Because such "principled deci- sionmaking within a legal landscape [is] the primary judicial task," courts may, consistent with majoritarian democratic theory, be given lawmaking tasks based upon "the belief that the legal fabric, and the principles that form it, are a good approximation of one aspect of the popular will, of what a majority in some sense desires."'l84 This re- sponse, however, is not as persuasive as some commentators consider it to be, in part because it is rooted in the outdated rhetoric of mechanical jurisprudence, associating courts with reasoned, timeless "principle," and legislatures with irrational, contingent "politics." After its critique by the legal realists, that rhetoric has lost much of its cogency, and critical scholarship during the 1980's has rendered it increasingly controversial.'85 More important, Calabresi's equation of the "legal landscape" with "one aspect of the popular will"'86 is incoherent. On the one hand, the majority appears at times to be quite at odds with the legal 182 G. CALABRESI, supra note 7, at 93, 94-101. 183Id. at 96. 184 Id. at 96-97. Calabresi also analyzes and rejects other responses to the counter- majoritarian difficulty, such as the arguments that legislatures are not as majoritarian as they appear, see Hamm, Legislative Committees, Executive Agencies &amp; Interest Groups, in HANDBOOK OF LEGISLATIVE RESEARCH 573, 576-82 (G. Loewenberg, S. Patterson, &amp; M.

CALABRESI, supra note 7, at 93-94 &amp; n.10. Cala- bresi agrees with other commentators such as John Hart Ely that however sensitive the jurist and however encrusted the legislative process, legislators are subject to periodic review by the voters and hence have a structural incentive to be responsive to popular demands. Frankly, I find this unpersuasive, because most of the terrible things legisla- tors do-or, more important, fail to do-are utterly obscured to the average voter, who returns the incumbent to office based on name recognition, high visibility, pork barrel projects, and so forth. See M. FIORINA, supra note 154, at 49. My views on this issue are not widely shared, and so I confine them to this footnote. 186 See generally Peller, The Metaphysics of American Law, 73 CALIF. L.

People accept most existing legal rules because they are the rules, not because people positively prefer them.189 Perhaps the primary insight to be drawn from Calabresi's argu- ment is a negative one: the majoritarian position cannot object to dy- namic statutory interpretation unless it appears that the original major- ity which sought enactment, and had a discernible intent on the interpretive issue, persists. Of course, this is all but impossible to demonstrate. Where societal and legal circumstances have decisively changed since the enactment of the original statute, there is usually good reason to believe that the historical majority has vanished.190 A third response, not explored by Calabresi, justifies dynamic stat- utory interpretation in cases like Weber, where it is likely that the ma- jority will has not changed. This response challenges the primacy that traditional legal process thinkers have given to the countermajoritarian difficulty. While it is routinely assumed by scholars such as Calabresi that our society is committed to majoritarian government, this is only true in the most general sense. Notwithstanding the one-person, one- vote cases, political gerrymandering and other devices ensure that elec- tions will not reflect true majority preference.'"' Once these representa- 187 For example, most Americans still seem to identify with the plight of Brian Weber, the white male who did not get into the training program because of affirma- tive action, and they have no sympathy for the prisoner in Smith v. Wade who wanted punitive damages for harm caused him while in prison. 188 See Brest, Interpretation and Interest, 34 STAN. L.

One is that there are occasions where changed circumstances very probably have not changed popular attitudes-the Weber case is a good example. See supra note 178. Another is that typically the result will be one of double indeterminacy: the intentionalist interpreter will not be able to prove that the original majority persists, while the dynamic interpreter will not be able to prove that subsequent developments represent a new majority will.

Yet direct democracy was considered and rejected in favor of representative de- mocracy. A Madisonian vision of the Constitution explains this result and suggests that the deliberative process of lawmaking seeks to trans- form private preferences, not just reflect them.194 Madison's Federalist No. 10 is the best exposition of this reasoning: the main danger of a direct democracy is that temporary majorities might enact laws which are unjust to the minority and not in the public interest.195 Structurally, a representative government better protects against this danger because it is able "to refine and enlarge the public views by passing them through the medium of a chosen body of citizens, whose wisdom may best discern the true interest of their country, and whose patriotism and love of justice will be least likely to sacrifice it to temporary or partial considerations."""

The Civil Rights Act of 1964, for example, was a great statute not only because it embodied a fundamental public value, but because the process of educating the American people both before and after enactment transformed private values as well.198 Likewise, Weber and other cases interpreting Title VII dynamically are part of the deliberative process by which this public voice speaks to new cir- cumstances. Even Bickel, the popularizer of the countermajoritarian difficulty with judicial review, admitted that our society's general com- mitment to majoritarianism is not absolute, for our political history reveals an equally important commitment to "a system of enduring ba- sic values," or national ideals.199 In short, under this third response, the Constitution seems to envi- sion a dynamic policy creation in which majoritarian preferences are filtered and transformed through the deliberations of their representa- tives. In Congress, the preferences of members of the House, the most accountable representatives, are tempered by further deliberation by members of the Senate, the less accountable representatives, who origi- nally were not even popularly elected.200 The role of the courts, there- fore, is to be further deliberative filters, as envisioned by Hamilton, mitigating the effects of unwise laws and exploring their full conse- quences.201 Under this more complex view of the countermajoritarian difficulty, dynamic statutory interpretation is not problematic unless courts are not appropriate representatives or are not accountable for their mistakes.

She starts with a functional, rather than popu- list or majoritarian, vision of representatives: "Their role . . . is to speak for, act for, look after the interests of their respective groups. . . . [T]he test of representation is not whether the leader is elected, but how well he acts to further the objectives of those he repre- sents."202 How the representative acts counts for more than how the representative is chosen. Pitkin posits that government is legitimate 'not by demonstrating its control over its subjects but just the reverse, by demonstrating that its subjects have control over what it does.... A representative government must not merely be in control, not merely promote the public interest, but also be responsive to the people."203 The lessons of Pitkin's scholarship are that representative government is most legitimate when it is responsive to the ongoing needs and problems of the community, and that "representatives" of the people need not all be popularly elected in a functioning democracy. Indeed, given the biases of the political process, the fact that judges are not elected may enable them to be better "representatives" of the people than their elected legislators are (in some instances). At the very least, judicial lawmaking through dynamic statutory interpretation can con- tribute to the overall legitimacy of government. Both public choice theory and institutional process theory suggest that the legislature acting alone will be subject to three biases which undermine the overall legitimacy of government: failure to enact or up- date public interest laws, avoidance of hard choices, and favoritism di- rected at power groups. These biases may be ameliorated by treating judges as representatives charged with interpreting statutes dynami- cally. The first of these biases is legislative inattention to laws benefit- ing the public, including failure to amend the few such laws enacted to reflect new circumstances.24 Public choice theory calls these "distrib- uted benefit laws" and posits that such laws will not often be enacted, because they rarely stimulate the formation of supportive interest groups and because they offer few opportunities for legislators to ad- vance their reelection chances.206 Institutional process theorists similarly argue that legislative policy does not address public problems in an integrated and timely man- 202 H.

Thus, Professor John Kingdon has character- ized the legislative process as "garbage can decisionmaking."208 Under this vision of the legislative process, Congress is an "organized anar- chy," which only passes statutes when a problem becomes politically salient at a time when a well-considered solution is available and the political climate is ripe for change. This confluence of publicized prob- lem, feasible solution, and political opportunity is to some extent adven- titious. While institutional process theorists have more faith than public choice theorists that Congress seeks the common good, the institutional process theory suggests that Congress does not, and cannot, perform that important function very often. Instead, Congress will rarely return to general interest statutes to revise them in light of changed circumstances. Courts can counteract the effect of legislative inattention to general public interests by interpreting statutes dynamically as the statutes grow older. Section 1983 is an example of this phenomenon. Because it was originally enacted as a response to officially sanctioned Southern discrimination against blacks, section 1983 became obsolete when the problem changed, that is, when state officials acted more discreetly, avoiding easy-to-spot discriminatory laws. As a result of the lack of legislative revision, the Supreme Court revived the statute in 1961 sim- ply by reinterpreting it in light of new, but equally real, forms of offi- cial oppression.209 Since then, the Court has filled in most of the details of the generally worded statute (as it did in Smith v. Wade) and has provided an efficacious but flexible scheme for effectuating important 208 See, e.g., A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE, supra note 10, at 321-23 (depicting the legislative process as one characterized by an inherent lack of consensus and direction); see also infra notes 214-16 and accompanying text. 207 Dodd, Congress, the Constitution, and the Crisis of Legitimation, in CON- GRESS RECONSIDERED 401-405 (L.

Little of this would have been achieved through the legislative process alone. The other two biases of legislative policymaking are its tendency to avoid or defer hard political choices, resulting in fragmented policy, and its tendency covertly and subtly to distribute advantages to a favored group, resulting in unfair policy.210 Public choice theory posits that Congress will avoid conflictual demand patterns by means of three strategies.211 First, Congress may delegate hard political choices to agencies, which are often "captured" by the regulated interests. Second, the legislature may ratify a compromise acceptable to the relevant inter- est groups. Third, and most subtly, Congress may adopt evasive strate- gies, such as leaving key terms ambiguous or conveniently obscuring the nature of an interest group's distribution behind the veil of some stated public purpose. The cumulative effect of these three strategies is that favored interest groups may profit at the expense of the public and that policy becomes a congeries of ad hoc compromises. A similar view is espoused by institutional process theorists.2"2 Congress tends to be decentralized much, if not most, of the time, thereby encouraging routine policymaking by "subgovernments" con- sisting of subcommittee members, bureaucrats, and lobbyists interested in the particular issue."' "Routine" legislation is legislation in which the President, Congress, and the political parties do not become actively involved and is generally controlled by these subgovernments pushing government policy toward distributions for favored interests. More publicized legislation will often reflect compromises with these sub- groups and delegation of future lawmaking responsibilities to them. This process, in which Congress defers policy choices or secretly distributes benefits to organized groups, does little to contribute to the legitimacy of our government. Courts cannot, under conventional con- stitutional theory, invalidate such interest group arrangements, but they can at least inject a dynamic deliberative process into statutes that avoid or hide tough policy choices. For example, Congress avoided many con- 210 See H. PITKIN, supra note 202, at 219-21. 211 See supra text accompanying notes 153-57. 212 See, e.g., R. DAVIDSON &amp; W.

Likewise, when Congress has delegated rulemaking power to administrators, it is they who will interpret the statute dynamically, but the Court's role is to assure that they do so through a deliberative process which is broadly responsive to the common good.2"6 There appears to be substantial scholarly and experiential evi- dence that statutes produced by Congress often do not sufficiently ad- dress the general needs of the citizenry and, when they do, do not make the hard policy choices. These phenomena make policy susceptible to obsolescence and interest group bias, that is, not a system of representa- tive government responsive to the needs of its constituency. A judiciary that always faithfully interprets such statutes according to the original intent is not contributing to the legitimacy of our government as a whole. A model of dynamic statutory interpretation would contribute somewhat to the judiciary's positive role in our representative democ- racy, because it would help to ameliorate some of the biases attendant to the legislative process. 3. Courts Are Institutionally Competent to Perform the Lawmaking Role Implicit in the Task of Dynamic Statutory Interpretation When circumstances have significantly changed and the statutory text is indeterminate, the countermajoritarian difficulty fails to provide a sufficient basis to deny courts the power to interpret statutes dynami- cally. Indeed, dynamic interpretation may contribute to the overall le- gitimacy of government. However, a central concern remains unad- dressed: whether judges can be entrusted with this sort of lawmaking. 214 443 U.S. 193, 204-09 (1979) (holding that a race-conscious statute is not nec- essarily discriminatory where it is narrowly tailored to redress past discrimination). 216 467 U.S. 561, 576-81 (1984). 216 See Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

The specter of Dred SCott217 and Lochnerls8 and other past misjudgments raise doubts about any theory that openly accepts this type of judicial lawmaking. These charges, that courts are incompetent to perform implicit lawmaking, are entirely overstated for three reasons. First, our polity already gives enormous lawmaking power to administrative agencies.21s In a vast range of statutes, agencies are empowered to update ongoing policy, often with virtually no congressional standards to confine ad- ministrative discretion.220 Although an agency's choice of policy is sub- ject to judicial review, courts typically uphold an agency's choice when it is not contrary to the text of the statute and is reached after a deliber- ative process.221 Moreover, bureaucrats, like judges, are not elected. To give them power to update statutes seems no more legitimate than to recognize a similar power in judges. If anything, judges who update statutes are more trustworthy. They are not only removed from the political process but are also in positions that give them few incentives to slant their interpretations, as bureaucrats often do, in favor of regu- 222 lated groups. 217 Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. (19 How.) 393 (1856). 218 Lochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45 (1905). 219 See Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. ?? 500-73 (1982). 220 Note here the disuse at the federal level of the old "nondelegation doctrine," which required Congress to set forth intelligible standards in statutes delegating re- sponsibilities to agencies so that the agency-implemented policy would ultimately be governed by majority rule. Compare Schechter Poultry Co. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495, 529-30 (1935) (final use of nondelegation doctrine by the Court to strike down a federal law) with Yakus v. United States, 321 U.S. 414, 425 (1944) (upholding delega- tion to the Office of Price Administration of power to control prices during World War II, the only standard being that prices be "fair and equitable") and Amalgamated Meat Cutters &amp; Butcher Workmen v. Connally, 337 F. Supp. 737, 745 (D.D.C. 1971) (upholding an unbridled delegation to President to stabilize "prices, rents, wages and salaries" without even a mention of the "fair and equitable" standard). 221 See Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resource Defense Council, 467 U.S. 837, 842-45 (1984) (upholding the Environmental Protection Agency's definition of "statu- tory sources"); Udall v.

PA. L. REV. 549, 559-67 (1985) (discussing judicial deference to administrative statutory interpretation). 222 See Parker, supra note 14, at 243-44. It may appear anomalous that bureau- crats, who are theoretically responsible to the President in most cases, should be unre- sponsive to the national public interest. But the public choice literature suggests that theoretical responsibility will matter little compared to interest group pressure, and common experience confirms this insight. See M. BERNSTEIN, REGULATING BUSINESS BY INDEPENDENT COMMISSION 126-63 (1955) (discussing agencies in terms of inde- pendence, responsibility, and the public interest); Posner, The Federal Trade Commis- sion, 37 U.

Our polity already gives much broader lawmaking power to judges in nonstatutory situations than the power I advocate here for statutory interpretation. A good example of this judicial discretion is structural injunction litiga- tion, in which courts preside over the reconstruction of public or private institutions.22 Although critics have decried structural injunctions as judicial "usurpation" of legislative and executive power,224 Professor Owen Fiss and other defenders of the structural injunction have care- fully justified the legitimacy of this type of judicial lawmaking.225 According to its supporters, structural litigation is justified be- cause, substantively, it contributes to our society's need for social justice and public values226 and because, procedurally, it reveals that judges are much better at policy creation than traditionally supposed.227 In structural litigation, the old bromides extolling judicial independence from political pressures and the professional ideal of reflective and dis- passionate analysis of focused problems have been demonstrated in the most trying circumstances in which judges are tempted to become per- sonally involved in their cases. For example, Fiss's case study of the Arkansas Prison Litigation reveals that at the center of the litigation was a cautious, although not otherwise celebrated, judge whose judi- cious style created a detailed new legal regime for the prison system and, if anything, enhanced our respect for the judiciary.228 Moreover, judges in structural litigation have been superior gatherers of informa- tion through adversary presentations and testimony at judicial hearings, the appointment of special masters, the submission of studies by ex- perts, and so forth.229 Indeed, the nonbureaucratic nature of the judici- ary has had some advantages. Unlike bureaucrats, judges must deliber- ate about problems brought before them; they cannot simply ignore problems. Also unlike bureaucrats, judges make law in the context of 223 An example of a public institution under reconstruction is a school district undergoing court-imposed integration. See 0.

The first two responses to concerns about judicial imposition of personal values have an analogical appeal: if we allow lawmaking by agencies in statutory matters and by courts in nonstatutory matters, we should allow lawmaking by courts in statutory matters. The third re- sponse is that the adjudicative process will minimize the imposition of values idiosyncratic to individual jurists, because it is incremental and conventional.230 Consider the process by which the Supreme Court came to interpret section 1983 when it found municipalities liable for civil rights violations.23' The Court's original view that municipalities could not be sued under section 1983 was subjected to unfriendly criti- cal scrutiny232 and even lower court evasion233 thereby justifying the Court's reconsideration of the issue in 1978.234 Indeed, the interpretive process continues, inevitably influenced by the courts' continuing expe- rience with section 1983.236 If the specific language in section 1983 had excluded municipal liability, the issue would not have been the object of litigation, and proponents of municipal liability would have taken their case to the legislature. If the issue had not been a relatively important societal concern, it probably would not have been litigated extensively 230 See generally S.

The Court substantially expanded the scope of ? 1983 in Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 187-92 (1961), by holding that the state action need not have been sanctioned by state law. The Court also held, however, that municipalities were immune under the statute. Finally, in Mo- nell v. New York City Dep't of Social Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 690 (1978), the Court held that municipalities could be sued under certain circumstances. 232 See, e.g., Note, Accountability for Government Misconduct: Limiting Quali- fied Immunity and the Good Faith Defense, 49 TEMP.

Just as the common law is built by slow case-by-case adjudication, the evolution of statutory common law proceeds over an extended period of time, as courts build carefully on their prior experience with the statute. The slowness and deliberate- ness of judicial lawmaking ensures that it will never be a threat to legislated lawmaking as the main source of policy preference and pri- orities in the United States. The judge's interpretation will not be idiosyncratic, moreover, be- cause it must be justified by a written opinion which relies on sources other than the judge's personal values. Although judges can find rea- sons and facts to support a variety of interpretations, their professional reputations depend in part on the persuasiveness of their justifications to readers with different values.236 Adjudication has been likened to an extended legal conversation, in which the interpreter is both constrained and legitimated by her need to explain and justify her interpretations to the interpretive community of other jurists, legislators, scholars, and lawyers.237 While the traditional legitimacy concerns about judicial lawmak- ing seem to be misplaced when applied against the cautious dynamic statutory interpretation model posed in this article, a nontraditional le- gitimacy concern is more troublesome. Professor (now Dean) Paul Brest argues that lawyers are social and economic elites who are less representative of society as a whole than the mix of lawyers and nonlawyers found in Congress.238 The implication of Brest's argument is that any defense of judicial lawmaking which appeals to the regula- tory effects of the legal interpretive community may be socially questionable. The legal process response to Brest's observation has been to in- voke the commitment of the legal community to such things as "order and justice" and "legal reasoning in bringing these values and princi- ples to bear in particular cases."239 This response is not completely sat- isfying, because so many lawyers, and too many judges, seem only per- functorily committed to these values, and because there appear to be structural biases in adjudication that favor established interests.240 238 See S.

III. DYNAMIC STATUTORY INTERPRETATION APPLIED Theoretically, my model of dynamic statutory interpretation offers quite a different focus from traditional theories of statutory interpreta- tion because it treats the evolutive context as a persuasive source of statutory meaning which should be considered in addition to the stat- ute's text and legislative history. Thus far in the Article, I have set forth the theoretical basis for the model and defended the model against the main academic objections. In this final Part, I will illustrate the operation of my cautious model of dynamic interpretation, while at the same time contrasting it to the intentionalist and modified intentionalist approaches often invoked by the Supreme Court and to Dworkin's re- cent (and obviously related) theory of statutory interpretation. One goal of this Part is to suggest that the model represents a better methodology for the Court's statutory interpretation cases than the other theories. I do not argue that the model of dynamic statutory interpretation will produce different results in a large number of cases. After all, as literary theory teaches us, the current context and public values always exercise some influence on the interpretive enterprise. Instead, the model is appealing because it rests upon a realistic vision of the legisla- tive and interpretive processes and because it promotes more candid decisionmaking in statutory interpretation cases. Just as dynamic statu- tory interpretation provides a more illuminating and defensible basis for the results in Weber and Smith v. Wade, so it does for many of the Court's other decisions. It further provides a realistic framework for pursuing Dworkin's suggestion that statutory interpretation looks to the life as well as the history of statutes. A. Dynamic Interpretation and the Intentionalist Mythology The intentionalist approach to statutory interpretation employed by the majority and primary dissenting opinions in Smith v. Wade and the dissenting opinion in Weber has severe disadvantages. It relies on a psychological construct, legislative "intent," in which very few scholars over "one-shotters"-i.e., auto-injury claimants, criminal defendants, and spouses in divorce proceedings-in litigation).</page><page sequence="61">1987] DYNAMIC STATUTORY INTERPRETATION 1539 still believe,241 and focuses on sometimes indeterminate, but more often irrelevant, arcana. My dynamic model of statutory interpretation is preferable to the intentionalist mythology because it is theoretically more consistent with modern ideas about interpretation and law, and because it concentrates the courts' and the parties' attention on the truly relevant factors. I do not claim that my approach is always easier to apply or even that it always yields more determinate answers in the hard cases of statutory interpretation. I only claim that it focuses on the appropriate considerations-those which actually influence and ought to influence the Supreme Court's interpretation of statutes all the time. The contrast can be illustrated by comparing Smith v. Wade with the Supreme Court's earlier interpretation of section 1983 in Pierson v. Ray.242 In Pierson, the Court considered whether state judges enjoy absolute immunity from section 1983 lawsuits arising out of their judi- cial duties. In a brief and unadorned opinion, the Court examined the history of section 1983 and the common law doctrine of judicial immu- nity. Given the strong historical and continuing policy behind judicial immunity243 and insufficient reason to think that section 1983 lawsuits against judges were necessary to protect civil rights, the Court held judges immune from section 1983 lawsuits.244 The Court's opinion has a simple persuasiveness, in part because it rested on a common-sense, widely-accepted current policy of judicial immunity, but also because it glided over the complex question of how Congress in 1871 would have answered the question. Although the dissenting opinion in Pierson ar- gued persuasively that Congress in 1871 expected judges to be sued under section 1983,245 the changes in society and law since 1871 (and the strong policy favoring judicial immunity) render such historical per- spective largely irrelevant. The original legislative expectation that judges could be sued rested upon the apparent widespread conspiracy of state judges to suppress the rights of blacks in the South during the Reconstruction.246 Were such a conspiracy still in existence, the pre- sumption of judicial immunity might be abrogated. As the Pierson Court implicitly recognized, however, there is no evidence that the modern state judiciary should not receive the accustommed judicial im- munity in civil rights cases.

This is a lesson of the section 1983 cases-both Pierson v. Ray (where the Court openly read the statute to reflect cur- rent, rather than historical, policy preferences) and Smith v. Wade (where the Court purported to conduct a historical inquiry, but was probably reading the statute dynamically).247 Of course, when the stat- utory scheme is more detailed and more recent, the original legislative expectations play a greater role in my model. As the following case suggests, however, these expectations should not always be determinative. In Morrison-Knudsen Construction Co. v. Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs,248 the Court considered whether employer contributions to union trust funds for pensions are "wages" for the purposes of computing compensation benefits under section 2(13) of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act of 1927 (LHWCA).249 At that time, section 902(13) defined wages as "the money rate at which the service rendered is recompensed under the contract of hiring in force at the time of the injury, including the reasonable value of board, rent, housing, lodging, or similar advantage received from the employer."250 The District of Columbia Circuit 247 For another example of these approaches, see Briscoe v. LaHue, 460 U.S. 325 (1983). In Briscoe, the majority opinion relied mainly on current policy and common law doctrine to grant police officers witness immunity in a ? 1983 lawsuit, while the dissenting opinion engaged in an excellent but irrelevant historical analysis of legisla- tive expectations concerning witness immunity in 1871. There are many other exam- ples. See, e.g., Memphis Community School Dist. v. Stachura, 106 S. Ct. 2537 (1986) (relying on doctrines of common law torts to overturn ? 1983 damage award based on the abstract value or importance of constitutional rights); Pembaur v. City of Cincin- nati, 106 S. Ct. 1292, 1302 &amp; n.1 (1986) (Stevens, J., concurring) (noting that the decision rests on policy grounds); Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U.S. 261 (1985) (using current practical policy considerations in interpreting ? 1983 with regard to aplicable statute of limitations); Tower v. Glover, 467 U.S. 914 (1984) (relying on lack of common law evidence supporting ? 1983 immunity for public defenders, but rejecting current policy argument); Pulliam v. Allen, 466 U.S. 522 (1984) (rejecting ? 1983 immunity for state magistrate because not supported by common law doctrine); Forrester v. White, 792 F.2d 647 (7th Cir. 1986) (examining state law to determine the scope of judicial au- thority and allowing ? 1983 immunity for a judge charged with sex discrimination in the discharge of a probation officer), cert. granted, 107 S. Ct. 1285 (1987). Much the same demonstration could be made for the Court's interpretation of the Sherman Act, the habeas corpus statute, ? 10(b) of the Securities Act, ? 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and several other common law statutes. 248 461 U.S. 624 (1983). 249 33 U.S.C. ? 901-950 (1982 &amp; Supp. III 1985). 2`0 33 U.S.C. ? 902(13) (1982). Following this lawsuit the statute was amended and now specifically excludes such fringe benefits as employer payments to pension funds.

First, the plain language of the statute sug- gested to the Court that contributions to employee pension, health, and welfare plans were not "similar" to board, rent, and lodging. The latter are "benefits with a present value that can be readily converted into a cash equivalent on the basis of their market values," while the former are contingent upon the employee's working for a certain time and so are speculative in value.262 Second, Congress could not have intended to include employer-funded pension benefits because they were all but un- known in 1927.253 Third, the Court relied on the long practice of the Director of Workers' Compensation not to include fringe benefits in the definition of wages.2 While this case is a close one, interpreting the statute dynamically might suggest a different analysis. The statutory text is hardly determi- native because the "similar advantage" language invites the courts or the agency to update the statute as new "advantages" are given to workers. The Court is surely correct in observing that the original leg- islative expectation was that pension benefits were not included, but the weight of those original expectations is reduced by a material change in societal circumstances, the dramatic growth of fringe benefits as a sig- nificant portion of the employee's total compensation package.2 5 The contingent nature of pension benefits does not obscure the fact that they are the functional equivalent of direct payments and that, like direct payments, they have a determinable present value.256 Because Congress III 1985)). 251 Hilyer v. Morrison-Knudsen Constr. Co., 670 F.2d 208 (1981), rev'd sub nom. Morrison-Knudsen Constr. Co. v. Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, 461 U.S. 624 (1983). 252 461 U.S. at 630-31. 253 Id. at 632. The Court also noted that Congress had amended the statute twice since 1927 without changing the definition of "wages," and that Congress had in 1964 amended the definition of wages in the Davis-Bacon Act to include fringe benefits, in order to bring the statutory definition "into conformity with modern wage practices." Id. at 632-33. 254 Id. at 634-35. This argument was undercut by the fact that the Director changed his mind in the course of the litigation and submitted a brief in the lower court arguing that the traditional agency position was wrong. See id. at 645-46 (Marshall, J., dissenting). 255 Today, fringe benefits are estimated to comprise about 15% of employers' com- pensation costs, and this figure is expected to rise to 33% by the year 2050. See id. at 641 (Marshall, J., dissenting). 256 Justice Marshall's dissenting opinion observed that in the instances where Congress or the relevant agencies had changed compensation statutes to include fringe</page><page sequence="64">1542 UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 135:1479 had not specifically focused on the exact ambit of "wages" when it passed the statute or amended it thereafter, there is no political com- promise that should be enforced on this issue. In fact, the agency began thinking seriously about the issue only six years before the Court's opinion-and the Director had submitted a brief in the proceedings be- low, arguing that the traditional position was wrong.267 Even where, as in Morrison-Knudsen, the original legislative ex- pectations are relevant, dynamic interpretation differs from a static ap- proach by refusing to stop with the original legislative understanding, unless that understanding is clearly grafted onto the statutory language. The interpretation reading pension benefits into the definition of wages is probably the fairest interpretation in light of current policy. Indeed, it is arguably more faithful to the original "deal" than the Court's in- terpretation, which cuts off important benefits workers now receive. This underlines a deeper problem with the intentionalist rhetoric often used by the Court. Although there are few cases like Morrison-Knud- sen due to the Court's adherence to a cautiously dynamic approach to middle-aged and relatively detailed statutes such as the LHWCA,218 the rhetorical focus of the parties and the Court on historical factors does sometimes obstruct understanding and lead to poor interpretations. Finally, when the statutory text is reasonably determinate and re- flects historically recent legislative deliberation, my cautious model of dynamic interpretation would not counsel further evolution of the stat- ute to reflect changed circumstances of which the legislature was gener- ally aware. For example, in Board of Governors v. Dimension Finan- cial Corporation,269 the issue was whether the Federal Reserve Board has jurisdiction over "nonbank banks" under the Bank Holding Com- benefits, there had been no reported problems with administering the new rule and determining the value of contingent benefits. Id. at 645-46 (Marshall, J., dissenting). 257 Id. at 644-45 (Marshall, J., dissenting). Professor Daniel Farber suggests that a statute such as this one, where there is some likelihood that Congress will sooner or later address the issue, might be treated differently from a general statute such as ? 1983, which will probably not be amended. I agree that greater caution should be shown by courts in the former situation, but a pure wait-and-see attitude typically involves more waiting than seeing. 258 See, e.g., Offshore Logistics, Inc. v. Tallentire, 106 S. Ct. 2485 (1986) (typical of the Court's willingness to bend statutory language in an area otherwise dominated by federal common law); Lowe v. SEC, 472 U.S. 181 (1985) (typical of the Court's dynamic interpretation of regulatory statutes to reflect changed constitutional limita- tions); Garcia v. United States, 469 U.S. 70 (1984) (typical of the Court's dynamic interpretation of old criminal laws to update them to current concerns); SEC v. Jerry T. O'Brien, Inc., 467 U.S. 735 (1984) (typical of the Court's dynamic interpretation of old statutes, in this case the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, to reflect new statutory developments). 259 106 S. Ct. 681 (1986).</page><page sequence="65">1987] DYNAMIC STATUTORY INTERPRETATION 1543 pany Act.260 The statute gives the Board jurisdiction over "banks," which it defines as any institution that "(1) accepts deposits that the depositor has a legal right to withdraw on demand, and (2) engages in the business of making commercial loans."'261 The Board asserted juris- diction over nonbank banks, or institutions that accept deposits that are "cas a matter of practice" payable on demand (notwithstanding technical provisions requiring prior notice) and that use those deposits to purchase commercial paper, certificates of deposit, and similar money market instruments. The Board justified this action on the basis of sig- nificant change in the societal circumstances of bank regulation: after Congress opened up competition for deposits in 1980 nonbank banks exploded into the market, thereby threatening the general system of banking regulation administered by the Board.262 A unanimous Su- preme Court overturned the Board's assertion of jurisdiction because it went beyond the "plain meaning" of the statute. The model of dynamic statutory interpretation explicated in this Article would support the Court's approach in Dimension Financial. While both the societal and legal context of the statute changed in ways probably not anticipated by Congress, the statutory language is rela- tively determinate. The statute's technical requirement that the institu- tion must "accept[] deposits that the depositor has a legal right to with- draw on demand,"268 does exclude nonbank banks. The historical perspective lends further (and decisive) support to the Court's decision, for it suggests that Congress expected the technical language to be stringently enforced. In fact, Congress has carefully amended this pro- vision twice in the last thirty years to liberalize this language.264 The apparent legislative compromise is not one that the Court should alter, particularly in light of recent legislative efforts to curtail, rather than expand, the Board's jurisdiction. Because the Supreme Court often informally follows something approaching this cautious model of dynamic statutory interpretaton, this model would not change the results in many cases. The model would, however, introduce greater candor and more consistent analysis into the Supreme Court's jurisprudence of statutory interpretation. It would also contribute to a long-needed doctrinal change, liberalization of the rule that prior interpretations of statutes should almost never be 260 12 U.S.C. ? 1841 (1982). 211 12 U.S.C. ? 1841(c) (1982). 212 49 Fed.

Once statutory interpretation is divorced, at least at times, from the search for original intent, this reason for re- specting statutory precedents is negated. Of course, prior statutory precedents should normally be upheld, based upon the same precepts of stare decisis that apply to common law precedents; they should simply not be given any greater deference than is necessary.266 B. Dynamic Interpretation and the Gambit of Hart and Sacks My model of dynamic interpretation is akin to the Hart and Sacks purpose-of-the-statute approach267 because I join Hart and Sacks in their rejection of the mythology of intentionalism and their positing of a progressive blend of formalism and realism. Moreover, I would usually agree with the results reached by the Supreme Court when it has uti- lized a purpose approach, as it did in Weber. On the other hand, my approach differs significantly in theory from that of Hart and Sacks, because I do not make the same idealized assumptions as Hart and Sacks do, and I am willing to admit that courts make policy choices in 265 Liberalization of this rule is the subject of a work in progress, W. Eskridge, Overruling Statutory Precedents (Feb. 1987 draft). The stare decisis rule is suggested by Justice Brandeis' dissent in Burnet v. Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co., 285 U.S. 393, 406- 07 (1932), and is commonly invoked by the Court. See Square D Co. v. Niagara Fron- tier Tariff Bureau, 106 S. Ct. 1922, 1930-31 &amp; n.34 (1986); Miller v. Fenton, 106 S. Ct. 445, 452 (1985); Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 736-37 (1977). On the other hand, the Court has arguably violated the rule in such cases as Monell v. New York Dep't of Social Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 695 (1978) (overruling the more than dec- ade-long interpretation that municipalities could not be sued under ? 1983); Continen- tal T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 47 (1977) (replacing the ten-year-old rule on the per se rule of illegality of restrictions on sale of goods after title has passed with a rule weighing the reasonableness of the restriction); Lodge 76 v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Comm'n, 427 U.S. 132, 154 (1976) (explicitly overruling the Briggs-Stratton doctrine which the Court pronounced in 1949 to permit states to regu- late some strike activities irrespective of the NLRA). 266 For example, if the Supreme Court in 1872 had interpreted ? 1983 to exclude punitive damage awards, based upon the common law in that decade, I would not consider that statutory precedent compelling one hundred years later. Not only has the common law context of ? 1983 changed, but the statute's purposes and operational context have changed as well. For instance, Monroe v. Pape, 356 U.S. 167, 187 (1961), overruled on other grounds, Monell, 436 U.S. at 701, introduced a new era for the statute. Hence, I would overrule that 1872 precedent as inconsistent with the modern trend in ? 1983 cases. On the other hand, if Monroe had never been decided, and ? 1983 had remained in disuse, I would probably leave the 1872 precedent intact, based simply upon general principles of stare decisis. 267 See infra note 275 and accompanying text.</page><page sequence="67">19871 DYNAMIC STATUTORY INTERPRETATION 1545 hard cases of statutory interpretation. The Hart and Sacks approach to statutory interpretation rested upon the assumptions that statutes have rational purposes and that judges can find and apply those purposes: In interpreting a statute a court should: 1. Decide what pur- pose ought to be attributed to the statute and to any subordinate provision of it which may be involved; and then 2. Interpret the words of the statute immediately in question so as to carry out the purpose as best as it can . ...268 These were appealing assumptions in the 1950's, but today they are highly controversial. Public choice scholarship and institutional polit- ical theory, such as Kingdon's "garbage can model," have demonstrated that many legislative acts are not "rational" or "purposive" in the way Hart and Sacks used the terms.270 Indeed, the "typical" statute is one with a congeries of purposes and policies-not all of them entirely ra- tional and not all of them consistent with one another! Recall the analysis of the Title VII cases in the first Part of this Article. The simple Hart and Sacks approach to those cases strikes me as misleading and inadequate. To proclaim that the single purpose of Title VII was to provide jobs for minorities, as the Court did in Weber, is to misstate history. There were many purposes embodied in Title VII-some of them, such as the sex discrimination provision, added quite adventitiously-and if there were a single overriding purpose, it would be to create a color-blind society, a purpose invoked most per- suasively by the dissenting opinion.271 Moreover, no matter which pur- pose one accepts in Weber, it would seen to be at odds with the statu- tory provision protecting seniority rights at issue in Stotts. Title VII embodies a curiously shaped vision of fair employment, one that is sus- ceptible to a Hart and Sacks analysis only through the most tortured reading of the statute. The model of dynamic statutory interpretation developed in this Article is based upon a more realistic view of the legislative process and is more defensible under our axiomatic assump- tion of legislative supremacy in a representative democracy. 268 H.

That is, by focusing on legislative purpose, Hart and Sacks would permit statutory law to grow and develop because legislative purpose is a more elastic concept than legislative intent, and at the same time to sustain its legitimacy by reference to original legislative expectations, legislative purpose being the next best thing to specific legislative intent. Judges can create new law without having to admit it. However politically attractive such a progressive formalism might be, it is an uncomfortable position for judges to take. Candor alone argues in favor of an approach that admits the nature and considera- tions involved in judicial lawmaking.272 Additionally, the Hart and Sacks "gambit" has more often than not been used to the Court's discredit, having contributed to sloppy opinions such as the majority opinion in Weber. Consider a further ex- ample, the Court's decision in Bob Jones University v. United States.273 In Bob Jones, the issue was whether a nonprofit private school pre- scribing racially discriminatory admissions standards could qualify as an institution "organized and operated exclusively for religious, chari- table, . . . or educational purposes" and hence, be exempt from income taxes pursuant to section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.274 The quoted statutory language originated in the 1894 income tax law and was included in every subsequent version of the federal income tax law. Petitioner Bob Jones University argued that its activities "exclu- sively for . . . educational purposes" entitled it to exemption under the plain meaning of the statute. The Court rejected this argument and held that the University's racially discriminatory admissions policies precluded its receiving the statutory exemption. To reach this result, the Court employed the clas- sic Hart and Sacks purpose-of-the-statute approach.2" The Court found the general purpose of section 501, and its companion provision section 170 (which allows taxpayers to deduct contributions to section 501 organizations276), to be the provision of tax benefits to organiza- tions serving "charitable purposes" because such organizations afford a 272 Judge Posner writes eloquently on the subject of candor in his article on real- ism and formalism in statutory cases.

To begin with, the Court oversimplified the legislative purpose of section 501 exemptions. Other Supreme Court decisions suggest that the main purpose of section 501 was to contribute "to the diversity of association, viewpoint, and enterprise essential to a vigorous, pluralistic society,"'28' and a perusal of the 106,000 organiza- tions receiving the exemption in 1982 suggests that this is a more real- istic goal than that posited by the Bob Jones Court.282 Moreover, the Court's opinion treated legislative attention to the subject arbitrarily. On the one hand, the Court emphasized the enactment of civil rights legislation expressing public concern about racial discrimination in edu- cation. On the other hand, the Court all but ignored the argument that Congress had had numerous opportunities to extend this policy to pri- vate educational institutions but had never done so.283 Bob Jones is a classic case in which the Hart and Sacks approach is invoked by the Court as a substitute for careful analysis. The Court obviously created new law in this case, going well beyond what Con- gress had done. Can it be justified? The best justification is the dy- namic, deliberative one suggested by the concurring opinion of Justice 277 Bob Jones, 461 U.S. at 587, 591-92. 278 Id. at 592. 279 Id. at 592-96. 280 "In 1894, when the first charitable exemption provision was enacted, racially segregated educational institutions would not have been regarded as against public pol- icy."

Section 501 itself was amended many times, yet Congress never added the caveat created by the Court. In- deed, Congress added ? 501(j) to deny the exemption to social clubs practicing racial discrimination, but again failed to address the situation of private schools.</page><page sequence="70">1548 UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 135:1479 Powell.284 The statutory language is open-ended and the original his- tory of the statute is of little relevance because circumstances have changed radically. Hence, the evolutive perspective is critical. Our cur- rent attitudes about giving tax breaks to racially discriminatory institu- tions are decisively influenced by the public deliberation in which we have engaged since Brown285 and the various civil rights statutes. To the extent we have policymaking discretion, we should exercise it to penalize discrimination. Probably for this reason, the Internal Revenue Service, the agency charged with implementing section 501, adopted the antidiscrimination policy in 1970, which triggered a far-reaching policy debate in Congress during the 1970's. Ultimately, Congress rejected all efforts to overturn the agency's action and Justice Powell found some evidence that informed opinion embraced the agency's new interpreta- tion.286 The Court's result capped a decade of deliberation on this pub- lic issue by putting the antidiscrimination exception in the statute. One may disagree with this dynamic policy analysis, but it is more edifying than the obfuscating Hart and Sacks approach to the statute posited by the Court. At least it is honest: the Court's commitment to the public value of a nondiscriminatory society is important enough to influence its interpretation of an ambiguous statute. Congress may compromise that public value, within certain constitutional limits, but until it does so the Court should continue the uniquely public delibera- tive process that it started in Brown. The broader point to be drawn from this analysis is that the Su- preme Court often purports to rely on original legislative purposes in interpreting statutes, while in fact using the Hart and Sacks purpose analysis to bend statutory language to satisfy current policy goals.287 This typically leads to a sharp dissenting opinion that dredges up his- torical background material to disprove the Court's assertions about the historical understanding. The Court, in turn, often responds with its own historical material. What is too often lost in such an exchange of historical arcana is a careful analysis of the statutory text, the evolving 284 Bob jones, 461 U.S. at 606 (Powell, J., concurring). 283 Brown v.

Then, rig- orous deliberation can be given to the pertinent policy choices that the Court must make.288 C. Dynamic Interpretation and Dworkin's Law as Integrity Notwithstanding theoretical and practical problems, the Hart and Sacks modified intentionalist approach to statutory interpretation is a significant improvement over the intentionalist approach. Similarly, Dworkin's theory of statutory interpretation, set forth in some detail in Law's Empire,289 is a great improvement over the Hart and Sacks ap- proach. Dworkin's theory of statutory interpretation is part of his gen- eral theory of "law as integrity," in which he argues that all law, in- cluding common law, statutes, and the Constitution, is a continuous process of interpretation. Dworkin has in an important way challenged scholars and judges to think about statutory interpretation as an ongo- ing process focusing on the present, and has linked his theory of statu- tory intepretation with a comprehensive theory of law. Dworkin's argument is rich and complex, much more complete than the summary here. Dworkin posits that "integrity in legislation," which requires lawmakers to try to make the total set of laws morally coherent, is "so much part of our political practice that no competent interpretation of that practice can ignore it."290 The legislative princi- ple of integrity not only describes a key impulse in our polity, Dworkin argues, but is central to the legitimacy of our government.291 Like jus- tice and fairness, integrity in law contributes to the fraternity of the 288 For examples of the Court's most candid admission that it is drawing upon current, rather than historical, policy purposes, see Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards, Inc. v.

Dworkin, supra note 121 (statutory interpretation as a "chain novel"). 290 R.

Dworkin views interpretation as akin to a "chain novel," in which a common law precedent or a legislated statute is the first, and foremost, chapter in the novel and subsequent authors, usually judges, are called upon to add new chapters. The goal of the seriatim contributors to the chain novel is to make the novel the best, most internally coherent, work it can be.296 Thus, the interpreter of statutes "interprets not just the statute's text but its life, the process that begins before it becomes law and extends far beyond that moment. He aims to make the best he can of this continuing story, and his inter- pretation changes as the story develops."297 Dworkin's vision of legislation is romantic, perhaps the noblest ap- proach to the subject in print. But is the legislative principle of integ- rity a fair statement of our political morality? I have some initial doubts, although perhaps they are provisional. To begin with, I doubt that Dworkin's view of legislation is or can be accurate. To establish his argument that the legislative principle of integrity is instinctive in our political system, Dworkin points to our collective disdain for "checkerboard statutes," those that treat different groups of people in different ways, without a clear principled reason.298 Such statutes may be an inherent part of our system, however. Title VII is certainly as principled a statute as any we have, and its principle of equal employment opportunity is a great principle.

For example, Title VII surely included section 703(h), which created an exception for bona fide seniority systems, to attract or retain union support.302 Most statutes, standing alone, are compromises. Over time, of course, Congress amends the statute and creates new but related ones. Not only do the new statutes have their own internal inconsistencies, but they are often inconsistent with the thrust of earlier statutes because the public concerns are different or the political circumstances different. This is the policy fragmentation about 299 Section 703(a)-(d) of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. ? 2000e-2(a) to -2(d) (1982), sets forth the basic nondiscrimination provisions, but other sections create vari- ous exceptions. See id. ?? 2000e(b) (definition of "employer" excludes small firms, governmental entities, etc.), 2000e-1 (exemption for religious educational institutions), 2000e-2(f) (special rule for members of the Communist Party), 2000e-2(h) (special exception for bona fide seniority systems). 300 See, e.g., I.R.C. ? 501 (1982 &amp; West Supp. 1987) (excepting certain "ex- empt" organizations from the general rule of federal income taxation); 15 U.S.C. ? 77(d) (1982) (excepting various "exempt transactions" from the general requirement of registration prior to the sale of securities). 301 The economists' versions of the public interest theory of regulation provide convincing explanations of the varied pattern of political choices.

While I think courts can mitigate the incoherence, I do not be- lieve courts can substantially erase it.303 Moreover, the checkerboard pattern of statutes appeals to two val- ues built into our political system: reliance and intensity of preferences. The reliance value means that once a checkerboard policy has been established, courts or the legislature may refuse to broaden it, but neither should they take it away.304 We also value intensity of prefer- ences: if one group of Americans wants nothing in life but a bloated pension system, better than that assured by Social Security, the system will often give it to that group. The reliance value will then preserve that special benefit over time. Many Americans will consider this ar- rangement "fair," so long as they believe that their own group's most intense preferences will also be satisfied.305 My doubts about Dworkin's argument are reinforced by the in- sights of critical and feminist legal scholars. Where Dworkin sees pat- terns of principle in some statutes, critical and feminist scholars see patterns of oppression, subordination, and mystification. For example, Dworkin could argue that our society is deeply committed to battling employment discrimination based upon sex. This does seem to be a principle that gives coherence to a range of statutes and judicial deci- sions, including Title VII and its rich case law. Yet this coherence may be superficial, since Professor Catharine MacKinnon argues that Title VII has not only failed to protect women against employment discrimi- nation, but has sanctioned it.306 Professor Susan Estrich's recent article demonstrates the sexism and incoherence of the criminal law of rape and includes in her indictment "reformist" legislation such as the Model Penal Code.307 These and other critical studies not only suggest "' Dworkin does not explicitly analyze the public choice literature, but his appar- ent response is that some political compromises are of course inevitable and that a compromise statute generally subserving principle (such as Title VII) is better than no statute at all. See R. DWORKIN, supra note 1, at 217-18. This response severely under- estimates the pervasiveness of checkerboard statutes. 304 The reliance value also explains why judicial doctrine is often incoherent; stare decisis prevents courts from overruling their precedents, but it does not require courts to expand the reasoning of obsolete precedents to new fact situations. Thus, the obsolete past and the novel present coexist over time. 305 But see R. DWORKIN, supra note 1, at 178-84 (suggesting that on occasion the most intense prefernce leads individuals to a ready compromise, which of itself com- promises the integrity of the preference). 31 See C. MACKINNON, SEXUAL HARASSMENT OF WORKING WOMEN (1979). 307 Estrich, Rape, 95 YALE L.J. 1087 (1986); see Olsen, Statutory Rape: A Femi- nist Critique of Rights Analysis, 63 TEX. L.

On the one hand, then, Dworkin's principles of integrity do not adequately describe what American legislatures do or the statutes they produce. On the other hand, even the aspirational appeal of Dworkin's argument-that any inconsistencies created by the legislature do not re- present our society at its best, and courts ought to weave statutory checkerboards into a coherent pattern-not only runs against the grain of the common assumption of legislative supremacy, but is also poten- tially very conservative because it might propagate morally outmoded values. Notwithstanding these problems, I concur with Dworkin's quest for coherence in the law in two important respects. First, there are certain public values-such as nondiscrimination and freedom of speech, press, and religion-which courts will protect from statutory encroachment, often through strained statutory interpretation. Second, courts will bend old statutes in response to more modern policies. In these ways, courts do lend greater coherence to statutory law; and I agree with Dworkin that this contributes to our government's overall legitimacy and worthiness. But I am doubtful that the courts can per- form the truly utopian task of creating a general coherence in a corpus of legislated law which is inherently checkerboard in nature. Dworkin distinguishes sharply between a rulebook community, in which citizens have a general commitment to obey rules created by gov- ernment, and a community of principle, in which citizens see them- selves governed, not just by political compromises, but by basic princi- ples.309 The latter seems to me a worthier sense of community. But the distinction oversimplifies our polity, which has elements of both com- munities: we are committed to a rulebook mentality as to myriad things, but we also have common values that bond us together. My essential disagreement with Dworkin is that I do not think law can transform our community from a hybrid into a community of principle. There is a telling contrast between various conceptualizations of judges. The judge in many of Dworkin's works is called Hercules, sug- gesting an all-powerful, omniscient figure who roams the fields of law 308 See, e.g., Kennedy, The Structure of Blackstone's Commentaries, 28 BUFFALO L. REV. 205 (1979) (discussing the conflict between individual freedom and the com- munal coercive action thought necessary to achieve this state); Kennedy, Form and Substance in Private Law Adjudication, 89 HARV.

Admittedly a caricature, Hercules is like a utopian planner, the noblest of figures. But this model is not much like the judges whom I have known. Instead, judges interpreting statutes according to something like the dynamic model in this Article are like diplomats acting upon orders from their national foreign service.310 These diplomats must often apply ambiguous or out- dated communiques to unforeseen situations, which they do in a crea- tive way, not strictly constrained by their orders. But they are, at bot- tom, agents in a common enterprise, and their freedom of interpretation is bounded by the mandates of their orders, which are not necessarily consistent or coherent over time, or even at any one time."' Judges who interpret statutes are sometimes Hercules, as Chief Justice Earl Warren and his colleagues perhaps were in Brown,312 but most often they are diplomats. Under the current assumptions of our society this is not considered a bad thing: judges who think they are Hercules, unless they are very clever, are frequently reversed. The role of the faithful public servant who applies decency and fairness to a system fraught with incoherence is a noble role. It is an everyday nobil- ity, not the storybook nobility of Utopia, and more to be cherished for that.313 CONCLUSION My purpose in this Article is to challenge the often-stated (but less often believed) assumption that statutory interpretation is nothing but an exercise in finding answers that were fixed when the legislature originally enacted the statute. Like other texts, statutes are dynamic things: they have different meanings to different people, at different times, and in different legal and societal contexts. It is a significant departure from current doctrine to assert, as I do, that federal courts should interpret statutes in light of their current as well as historical context. Dynamic interpretation is most appropriate when the statute is old yet still the source of litigation, is generally phrased, and faces sig- 310 Professor Daniel Farber suggested this analogy to me in a letter commenting on this Article. 311 Judge Posner analogizes judges to platoon commanders who must interpret and apply battlefield orders. See Posner, supra note 7, at 189-92. I find this, too, an illuminating and imaginative metaphor which is similar to the one explicated in text. 313 Brown v. Board of Educ., 347 U.S. 483 (1954). 313 I am thinking here of Edward Weinfeld, a judge in the Southern District of New York for the last 36 years, and still actively doing justice from 5:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m. six or seven days a week. Judge Weinfeld is not Hercules, but his day-in and day- out quest for justice within the confines of statutes and judicial precedents is the noblest thing a judge, or any other public servant, can do.</page><page sequence="77">1987] DYNAMIC STATUTORY INTERPRETATION 1555 nificantly changed societal problems or legal contexts. Dynamic inter- pretation is least appropriate when the statute is recent and addresses the issue in a relatively determinate way. As I have emphasized in this Article, my model of dynamic inter- pretation is a cautious one. It is, of course, possible to defend a more iconoclastic approach to the issue.-"' Critical scholars argue that textual meaning is not so determinate as I assume in this Article.315 These approaches to interpretation are more difficult to justify in light of cur- rent assumptions about legislative supremacy and statutory interpreta- tion. They would have more far-reaching effects than my proposal. Nevertheless, I invite expansion upon this model. In the spirit of the legal realists, I believe that candid and constructive policy debate will enrich the long neglected discipline of statutory interpretation. 314 See G. CALABRESI, supra note 7.
