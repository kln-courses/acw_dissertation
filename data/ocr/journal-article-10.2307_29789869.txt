<plain_text><page sequence="1">307 BRONZE AGE DYNAMICS IN SOUTHEAST SPAIN Antonio Gilman INTRODUCTION For V. Gordon Childe, and for most Europeanist prehistorians even today, European prehistory could best be understood as the "irradiation of European barbarism by Oriental civilization" [ 1 ]. In its more thoughtful formula? tions, notably Childe's, this diffusionist position had at its base a reasonable argument. The developed economies of the Orient required raw materials and had to obtain them from an ever wider geographical area. Their emissaries, variously characterized as colonists, prospectors, traders or missionaries, would have played in prehistoric Europe the role Europeans were to play on a worldwide scale under capitalism [2]. In recent years all ex Oriente lux arguments have been subject to severe and meticulous scrutiny [3]. On the one hand, it has been demonstrated that many features of allegedly Oriental derivation are found earlier in Europe than in the Near East. On the other hand, it has become apparent that many traits found together in Europe and held to come from the Orient are not found associated chronologically or geographically (do not form assemblages) in their supposed homeland. These observations have cast doubt on the traditional account of prehistoric cultural development in Europe, but they do not yet involve an alter? native explanation. As Childe recognized, it is precisely an alternative general account of pre? historic culture change that must be presented if diffusionism is to be supplanted [41. Nowhere in Europe has diffusion been used to explain prehistoric culture change to a greater extent than in Spain. Until recently, virtually every important cultural change occurring in the Peninsula between 5000 and 1000 B.C. has been considered to be the product of European influences [5]. Some prehistorians, such as Bosch-Gimpera, have argued for a largely autochthonous development in Iberian pre? history on the basis of the demonstrable typological and associational continuities between earlier and later cultural episodes. Renfrew has attacked the concrete basis of some of the diffusionist claims put forward for early Iberia [6]. Neither of these counters to diffusionism embarks upon the task of ac? counting for the progressive transformations of the archaeological record. Southeast Spain (Almeria and southern Murcia provinces) has yielded a rich, distinctive Copper and Bronze Age sequence. This will be examined here with a view to suggesting possible explanations for its regionally autonomous evolution. THE SEQUENCE IN SOUTHEAST SPAIN The basic corpus of data on the later pre? historic sequence of southeast Spain was ac? cumulated by the Belgian mining engineers Henri and Louis Siret. Their early work was partly published in 1887, but Louis Siret's later work, carried on until his death in 1934, was largely unpublished [71. The most impor? tant later works, Georg and Vera Leisner's survey of megalithic monuments and Beatrice Blance's account of the Almena/Argar sequence Antonio Gilman is Associate Professor of Anthropology (archaeology) at California State University, Northridge.</page><page sequence="2">308 depend largely on the Sirets' work [8]. The lack of stratigraphic precision with which it was excavated and the unfortunate vicissitudes it has undergone during its many decades in storage reduce the value of the Siret corpus. Be that as it may, this first gathering of in? formation proved satisfactory for the typological problems which preoccupied subsequent genera? tions of prehistorians. Only a few excavations, mostly recent, have added (or promise to add) significant new material: La Bastida de Totana [9], Los Miliares [10], Cerro de la Virgen [11], El Barranquete [12], and Terrera Ventura [13]. As a result, we still have only a fairly rudimen? tary culture-historical sequence for southeast Spain [14]. Early Neolithic Sites of the Impressed Ware Complex are very poorly represented in the southeast [15]. One large vessel from Cueva de los Tollos [16] has clear parallels in form and design to items in the Andalusian and Levantine Impressed Ware repertory. Cueva de Ambrosio, in the mountains of northernmost Almeria province, has an Impressed Ware level too [ 17]. By analogy to similar C-14 dated sites elsewhere in the western Mediterranean, these sites should date to the fifth millennium B.C. [18]. 0 r 50 Figure 1. Archaeological sites in the Almeria region.

These phases have been distinguished on the basis of a ty? pological analysis of megalithic monuments and their artifactual inventories. In the earlier phase, of Neolithic character, the tombs con? sist either of round, passageless, dry-stone? walled structures {Rundgr?ber) or of megalithic cists and passage graves. Their inventories, less elaborate than those of the later Almerian, in? clude stone axes, geometric microliths, bifacial ly flaked projectile points, undecorated pottery, shell bracelets, and flat anthropomorphic figurines. Burials are mostly collective, and sometimes also occur in caves [21]. Some settlements excavated by the Sirets (the most frequently cited is El G?rcel) have been assigned to the earlier Almerian, on a speculative basis as Arribas has stressed [22]. Recent excavations at the settlement of Terrera Ventura have yielded C-14 dates in the fourth millennium B.C. The megaliths in the general vicinity of the site, the Tabernas group of the Leisners, are of early Almerian type. This date and association constitutes the best evidence for the unity of the early Almerian, which may be assigned to the fourth millennium B.C. [23]. Copper Age The second phase of the Almena Culture is best known for the settlement and megalithic cemetery of Los Miliares. It is principally characterized by the elaboration of the col? lective burial ritual. The tombs are now large corbelled-vault passage graves {tholoi). These contain ritual and utilitarian goods: stone axes; a varied bifacially worked lithic industry; cast copper axes, chisels, daggers, knives, points, and saws; pottery, some painted, some incised {Symbolkeramik), most plain; idiosyncratic ritual items, such as baetyls and phalange idols; and a variety of exotic raw materials (such as callais, amber, ivory, and ostrich eggshell), among other things. The amount and kind of grave goods vary a great deal between tombs. Some of these differences in inventory appar? ently reflect change over time: tombs of the Leisners' Inventory Group II, containing Beaker pottery (and thus presumably dating to the end of the third millennium B.C.) [24] are poorer than those of the Beaker-less and presumably earlier Inventory Group I [25]. Other differences in grave-good wealth and variety may reflect functional (social) differences between the tombs' users/builders. Los Miliares itself is situated at the end of a promontory jutting into the Andarax river valley. It is separated from the megalithic cemetery behind it by a wall with bastions, interpreted as forti? fications [26]. Louis Siret found three "forts" overlooking the site; their contents are un? published. The C-14 sample for the settlement (2340?85 be: H-284/287) dates to after the construction of the town wall. The dates of 2430?120 be (KN-72) for the Los Miliares XIX tomb (which cannot be assigned to either inventory group), and of 2330?130 be (CSIC 81) and 2350?130 be (CSIC-82) for the El Barranquete 7 tomb [27], confirm that the later Almerian dates to the third millennium B.C. [28]. Bronze Age The El Argar Culture succeeds the Almerian in the southeast. The change is sharply marked in both burial and settlement patterns, as well as in artifact styles. Instead of being collective in megalithic tombs, burials are now single or double (earlier ones in stone cists, later ones in large jars) [29] and placed under floors within settlements. The burials contain the personal equipment of the dead: ornaments (diadems, bracelets, rings of copper or bronze, and beads, sometimes of exotic materials such as ivory), weapons (daggers, swords, halberds, points), ceramic vessels (such as the character? istic chalices), among other items. The relative</page><page sequence="4">310 wealth of the burials has not been studied in detail. (The Sirets did not publish all the gravelots from their sites and an up-to-date corpus is unavailable.) Nevertheless, the extreme wealth of some of the burials indicates "clear social differentiation" [30]. Indeed, the fact that many of the wealthy burials are of women suggests that the superordinate statuses they reflected were ascribed rather than achieved. Some Argaric settlements (El Argar itself, for example) continue to be situated on promon? tories and dissected terraces above river courses, but many are now located in extreme defensive positions on craggy hilltops hundreds of feet above the streams below (Ifre and El Oficio are typical examples). The construction of acropoles, together with the weaponry in the graves, sug? gests that militarism was more important in the social order of El Argar times than in that of earlier periods. Blance arrives at a date of 1700 to 1200 B.C. for the Argaric on the basis of typological parallels in Central Europe and the Aegean [31 ]. The available radiocarbon dates confirm this. The pre-Argaric (Beaker) levels at Cerro de la Virgen have a cluster of deter? minations in the first 150 years of the second millennium: 1940?40 be (GrN-5593), 1850?35 be (GrN-5764), 1970?60 be (GrN-5597), 1970?35 be (GrN-5596), and 1835?35 be (GrN-5598). The early Argaric occupation of the site is dated to 1785?55 be (GrN-5594). (The date of 1915?50 be [GrN-5995] for the uppermost Argaric layer at the site must be considered anomalous) [32]. The Argaric settlement of Cabezo Redondo (Villena, Alicante) has yielded C-14 dates of 1600?55 be (H-2277/1964) and 1350?55 be (GrN-5109). Thus, the Argaric lasted most of the second millennium B.C. ECONOMIC EVIDENCE FROM SOUTHEAST SPAIN As the recent review by Arribas indicates [33], economic evidence is scanty for all Spanish prehistory, not least for the Almena region. Thus, it is possible to summarize the main features for the sequence just outlined under a single heading. Virtually the only aspect of the forces of production about which we are reasonably well informed is metallurgy. The metal analyses of Junghans, Sangmeister, and Schr?der have provided information on the composition of a substantial number of artifacts from Almerian and Argaric sites. During the later Almerian artifacts were made of pure and arsenical copper; in the Argaric arsenical copper was supplemented by tin bronze. Full control of casting in two-part molds is also an Argaric achievement [34]. The increasing control over metalworking is accompanied by a decline in lithic technology from the fine pressure-flaked industry of the Almerian to the typologically uncharacteristic industry of the Argaric. Arribas summarizes the entirely nonquanti? tative references in the earlier literature to the exploitation of plants and animals. Wheat and barley, as well as some legumes (fava beans, lentils, peas), are noted from both Almerian and Argaric sites. Linen textiles have been found at a number of Argaric sites. Olive stones are reported from El Garcel and El Argar. The discovery of a water channel at Cerro de la Virgen suggests that crops may have been irrigated [35]. Sheep, goat, pig, cattle, horse, and deer are generally reported from Almerian and Argaric sites. Recent work on the fauna of the second millennium sites of Cerro de la Virgen and Cabezo Redondo gives quantitative expression to these reports [36]. At Cerro de la Virgen sheep and goats form 55 to 70 percent of the economically significant domesticates (in terms of minimum numbers of individuals). The percentage of pigs declines from 30 to 12 percent from Copper Age to Argaric times. Driesch interprets this decline as reflecting progressive local deforestation caused by human activities [37]. At Cabezo Redondo, 85 percent of the economically significant domesticates consist of sheep/goats. These caprovines are smaller in size than those from Cerro de la Virgen.</page><page sequence="5">311 THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVE Given the abundance of settlement sites from southeast Spain, much more economic evidence should be available than what has been briefly summarized above. Such evidence is lacking because archaeologists working in the area have not considered economic questions important. The diffusionist paradigm shifts the burden of accounting for the successive cultural manifestations on to prehistorians of other regions: the early Almerian is a cultura ibero sahariana [38], or ultimately derived from Palestine [39]; the later Almerian is brought by Aegean colonists [40]; the Argaric is produced by central European ("Beaker reflux") [41 ] or Anatolian [42] influences. To prove such propositions, economic information was un? necessary. What was needed were stylistically distinctive artifacts and of these archaeologists found quantities. Viewed in another light, however, the Almeria/Argar sequence, even in its present rudimentary state, presents clear indications of an autochthonous social evolution (for the understanding of which more knowledge of economic matters would be desirable). Over time one can observe increasing craft specialization (in the development of metal working), increasing class divisions within communities (in the shift from communal burials with ritual and utilitarian grave goods to individual burials with differing amounts of expensive personal equipment) [43], and increasing militarism (in the development of settlement fortifications and high status weaponry). These trends, which comprise the major substantial changes in the available archaeological record over time, must be accounted for in terms of the internal dynamics of an evolving cultural system if the diffusionist paradigm is to be replaced. In undertaking this task it is useful, as Childe was well aware [44], to adopt a Marxian perspective, which focuses on the social organization of production as the key to understanding cultural change. As Renfrew has pointed out, we are often called upon to choose between dichotomous "spiritual" and "material" accounts of history [45] (e.g., the "emic"/ "etic" explanatory modes emphasized by Marvin Harris). A Marxian outlook permits us to bridge this gap. We will not have to rely on tautologous arguments, such as Piggott's proposition that new developments do or do not occur in pre? history because societies are "innovating" or "conserving" in orientation [46]. It is no theoretical improvement to replace this frank (if circular) idealism with an eclectic function alism which, in its effort to allow equal weight to all "subsystems" of culture, must rely on human "needs" and "propensities" to explain cultural changes [47]. The presence or absence of such needs must be determined in a manner just as arbitrary and circular as the presence or absence of the "innovating" and "conserving" tendencies just cited. Historical materialism specifies the long-term economic causes of cultural change in a noncircular way. At the same time, Marxism avoids the excesses of a mechanical materialism which sees cultural phenomena as simply and directly determined by environmental/technological/demographic factors and ignores the antecedent sociohistor ical circumstances which crucially modify the effect of such undoubtedly important aspects of history [48]. To reject the evidence of ideological and social matters as "random noise," as Higgs and Jarman have put it [49], is to do little justice to archaeology as a science. We must try to explain the world of the past in terms which would not be absurd in the world of the present (where superstructural matters have no little weight). Dialectical materialism considers the superstructure to be integral to the mode of production and accords it due weight in explanations of historical events. Indeed, among materialist approaches Marxism is particularly appropriate because of the nature of the data from the southeast. According to classic archaeological principles,</page><page sequence="6">312 one is supposed to be able to reconstruct the economic technology of an extinct society better than its ideology or its social organiza? tion. For many prehistoric cultures, however, the weight of the evidence is reversed: we know much more about the superstructure than about the base. For the European Bronze Age in general, for example, we know much more about how the dead were buried than about how the living survived. As we have seen, the Almena/Argar sequence is no excep? tion to this rule. Thus, as we consider the causes underlying the successive changes in the extant archaeological record, we must also retrodict the forces of production from the evidence for social organization that we possess. Other materialist approaches, which consider social organization and ideology to be simple epiphenomena of the technoenvironmental base, would dismiss the available evidence from southeast Spain as largely useless or irrelevant. A Marxian perspective, as discussed above, suffers no such liability. We have reasonably convincing indications that from 4000 to 1000 B.C. southeast Spanish society became more militaristic and stratified. We must ask, therefore, what changes in the technical conditions of production could have changed the overall constraints governing the social relations of production so as to make the earlier, more egalitarian social arrangements untenable. Three possibilities will be considered here: the development of metal-working, the development of irrigation systems, and the introduction of olive and vine cultivation. METALLURGY Virtually the only local factor which has been considered important in determining the course of cultural development in southeast Spain has been the presence of metal ores. From the Sirets to the present, authorities have considered this resource to be what made Almena more attractive to foreigners than other parts of Spain. Thus, Childe argues in a characteristic passage that the "urbanization of the Almerian economy ... is presumably a reflection, however indirect, of oriental cities' demand for metal" [50]. The Leisners juxtapose the distribution of megaliths and copper sources, while Garcia Sanchez relates the distribution of Argaric sites to copper sources and trade routes [51]. The metal source argument is usually tied to the presumed existence of foreign prospectors, but it could easily be readjusted to allow autochthonous factors more play. Metal-working tends to be a full-time occupation, a classic example of commodity production. Insofar as metal artifacts become prerequisites for the maintenance of adequate levels of production, the "individual house? holder . . . must henceforth produce a surplus beyond his domestic needs to support specialists who produce not food but indigestible ores, ingots, and axes." It may be further argued that possession of metal weapons would con? solidate the ruling elite's control by affording it a decisive military advantage over its sub? jects [52]. Arguments along these lines could put metallurgy at the root of the development of social stratification in the southeast without recourse to Oriental prospectors. Such a line faces empirical difficulties, how? ever. It is hard to accept the idea that the artifacts which were in fact made in the south? east were crucial for total production to in? crease. Arribas puts the matter simply: "Desconocemos ?tiles agricolas de metal en la Edad del Bronce" [53]. The very inclusion of so many metal artifacts in burials suggests that what gave them value was more what they represented than what they accomplished. At the same time, history provides too many examples of the ephemerality of purely tech? nological advantages for one to be able to accept that the simple possession of copper daggers could have provided a ruling minority a decisive monopoly of force. The production of a luxury commodity such as metal reflects, of course, tendencies toward the restriction of the scope of some households' activities and</page><page sequence="7">313 toward the differential possession of wealth. By providing prestige equipment and a com? modity suitable for trade for other luxuries, metallurgy may have reinforced the power of already existent social elites. It does not seem, however, that metal played a crucial role in maintaining household production and security and, accordingly, it cannot have called those elites into existence. COPING WITH AN ARID ENVIRONMENT The southeast yields the richest prehistoric sequence in Spain, but today it is the dryest, poorest region of the country. On general prin? ciples, therefore, some prehistorians have sug? gested that irrigation was practiced in pre? historic times [54]. The possibility was not taken up seriously until Sch?le reported the discovery of an irrigation ditch of pre-Argaric date at Cerro de la Virgen in northern Granada province (by no means the dryest part of the region). This find, together with Louis Siret's report of a water channel at Los Miliares, lead Sch?le, as well as Arribas to suggest that irrigation was used to facilitate farming as early as the later Almerian [55]. Indeed, if the climate of the southeast was similar in later prehistoric times to that of the present, it seems likely that special steps to cope with the prevailing aridity would have been highly advantageous to an economy based on farming and may have accompanied its introduction. The intensification of agricultural production implied by such steps would have had far reaching social consequences. The region in which the Copper/Bronze Age fluorescence took place is in the rain shadow of the Betic mountain chain and large areas receive less than about 350 mm. annual average rainfall, often much less. Thus, Almeria city receives an average of 205 mm. and regions to the east of it as little as 120 mm. [56] Given the prevailing high temperatures, southeast Spain is the most arid region in Europe, a sub desert. Not only is precipitation scarce, but it falls on few occasions, when the rains may be torrential (and thus less useful for farmers): according to Neumann, the average number of rainy days annually is less than twenty in coastal Almena province [57]. Finally, precip? itation is highly variable from year to year, the total of the wettest years being four to five times higher than that of the dryest [58]. The long-term averages conceal many years of even more radical drought. Palaeoclimatological evidence for the south? western Mediterranean is scanty for any pre? historic period, but what is available does not suggest that climate in Almerian/Argaric times was very different from that of the present day. Pollen diagrams from southern and eastern Spain show no differences from present vegeta? tion not attributable to human intervention [59], and Kubiena reports that soil profiles at Los Miliares reflect a climate similar to that of the present [60]. By and large, it seems reason? able to conclude that no great climatic changes have occurred since the establishment of a winter rainfall pattern in the early Holocene. During the Copper and Bronze Ages, as in the present, the Almeria region would have been marginal for dry farming. Whyte defines three critical thresholds for Mediterranean dry farming: at about 250 mm. cereal farming is possible in rotation with fallow, but with grazing relegated to the semi-arid ranges; at about 350 mm. legumes may be grown in rota? tion with the cereals; only at 450 mm. is rain? fall sufficient to permit forage for animals to be included in the crop rotation [61 ]. Wheat, barley, and various legumes have been found at various Almerian and Argaric sites. Thus, given the variability of rainfall patterns, crop failures would have been all-too-regular for dry farmers even in the most favored parts of the southeast. In some regions (southern Almena province) dry farming would only be possible in the wettest years. Modern farmers in the southeast can expect a good crop only every fourth or fifth year on unirrigated land [62]. The permanence and wealth of Almerian ^nd</page><page sequence="8">314 Argaric sites suggest that their inhabitants dealt successfully with the problem of aridity. While evidence such as that from Cerro de la Virgen is most welcome, large amounts of direct evidence for Almerian/Argaric water distribution systems may be impossible to obtain because newer systems tend to obliterate older ones. As Earle has pointed out [63], the best line of attack is to examine the systematic relations of sites to present water resources: the location of many sites (Los Miliares, Almizaraque, and El Argar among them) at the junction of ramblas (dry washes) and major watercourses is suggestive. Be that as it may, it is clear that the means taken to over? come the climatic obstacles to stable agricultural production need not have involved very large scale public works or very elaborate techno? logical accomplishments. The exploitation of seasonal or occasional watercourses (flood water irrigation) and of springs can be under? taken at essentially Neolithic levels of tech? nology [64]. The major rivers of the southeast (the Andarax/Almena, the Almanzora, etc.) are abundantly fed at their sources during the winter-spring growing season and have reason? ably steep gradients. Thus, small communities would have had sufficient labor to build the short ditches required to water their fields. The present-day practice (of considerable documented antiquity) of constructing agricultural terraces along the sides of ramblas to take advantage of those watercourses' oc? casional torrents would also be an irrigation method not too complex to cast back into early times [65]. The significance of irrigation in the southeast is not, then, that the systems applied would have required great technical resources or great amounts of labor. Irrigation may have been essential for stable agricultural production, but it did not demand, as Wittfogel put it, "the coordination of a communal labor force and, above a certain magnitude, a leadership that directs the construction and maintenance of hydraulic installations and the distribution of irrigation water" [66]. As Glick has indicated, the much more elaborate systems of irrigation of eastern Spain were run virtually to the present day on egalitarian lines, with no need for managing technocrats [67]. Development of irrigation would have created limited stretches of more productive land, and warfare was clearly a prominent element in the social landscape, especially in Argaric times. Nevertheless, it is difficult to accept Carneiro's resource circumscription/population pressure/ warfare argument for the origins of social stratification [68], even in this promising territory. Population pressure is a difficult thing to demonstrate under the best of circum? stances (and there is little evidence from south? east Spain even for population increase). Furthermore, as Cowgill has very clearly shown, there is no reason to assume that it must, on general principles, exist [69]. We simply have no justification for arguing that Almerian/Argaric fertility was so inelastic as to compel increasingly hungry groups of people to fight over stretches of irrigated land. Irrigation changed the social organization of the prehistoric inhabitants of southeast Spain, but not as a mechanical reflection of exponential population increase or of the technical requirements of hydraulic manage? ment. Irrigation, rather, transformed the social relations of production. Childe is in the mainstream of Marxian thinking when he writes of irrigation: "Capital in the form of human labor was being sunk into the land. Its expen? diture bound men to the soil; they would not lightly forego the interest brought in by their reproductive works" [70]. Carneiro has shown us how village fission is the essential mechanism by which egalitarian social structure is main? tained as such [ 71 ]. If a leader is unbearably self-aggrandizing, he can be abandoned by his opponents. In the southeast of Spain, however, the work that had been put into the land would reduce the willingness of dissidents to leave. By the same token, although a water distribution system may be set up without large</page><page sequence="9">315 labor crews, once it is in existence (and partic? ularly after it has been extended little by little) [72] it represents a capital investment of great value, and not just to its makers. The system would have to be defended against forcible expropriation by outsiders. As Cowgill has put it, "more wealth means that a society (or at least its elite) has more to gain from conquering rich neighbors . . . ; however, it also means that the society's own richness is coveted by neigh? bors . . ." [73]. (This principle would come into force all the more strongly in that the variability of climate may have stimulated in? habitants of Almeria not only to build water distribution systems, but also to establish stores of supplies not for immediate use, but as an insurance against an uncertain future.) Millon has stressed the potential for internal and ex? ternal conflict immanent in irrigation agricul? ture [74]. It is not hard to imagine how this potential could eventually have led to the most salient characteristics of the Argaric Bronze Age: a warrior elite buried in fortified citadels. The long-term social value of their productive works would require households to make provisions for defense and at the same time would limit their power to control their defenders. MEDITERRANEAN POLYCULTURE In his account of the development of class society in the Aegean, Colin Renfrew has stressed the importance of "Mediterranean polyculture," the cultivation of the vine and the olive together with cereals as basic elements of farming [75]. As he has indicated, the olive and the vine would have increased agricultural yields because they do not compete with pre existent cereal crops either in the work they require or in the locations in which they are planted. These increased yields would have provided the surplus required to support the Aegean palace economies of the Bronze Age. Renfrew's account of why the increased yields were given over to Minoan and Mycenaean princes rather than devoted to the farmer's own purposes is, in my opinion, somewhat elusive. Nevertheless, it is easy to agree that the establishment of the modern pattern of Mediterranean farming must be considered fundamental to the understanding of the evolution of Mediterranean societies. The significance of vine and olive cultivation can be better understood in the context of commodity production. As Renfrew points out, olive oil and wine are classic commodities, suitable for storage and sale, easy to deploy in a supra-household economy. Even more im? portant, and unmentioned by Renfrew, is the fact that the planting of vines and olives represents a very significant investment. Vines do not yield fruit for some three years after the cuttings are planted, but produce for generations thereafter [76], Olive planting is an act of even greater forethought: planted cuttings do not bear fruit for twelve to fifteen years and do not reach their best yields until forty years have passed [77]. A social context which permits the transgenerational planning required for Mediterranean polyculture must be one in which the household's security can be guarded, one in which production in large part goes beyond use values [78]. The delayed maturity and long-term productive capacity of the olive and the vine encouraged primary producers to pay for protection by and from their overlords. The organization of production of these resources overstrains the limits of an egalitarian social order. When the olive and the vine were introduced into the Spanish southeast, they would have not only increased yields, but also helped combat the insecurity of production caused by the prevailing aridity. Domestic olives and vines are both cultivated clones of native Mediterranean shrubs and thus have consider? able capacity for drought resistance (olives more than vines) [79]. These cultivars would survive the southeast's bad years to yield fruit in good years. Since their fruit can be con? verted into storable commodities, the olive and the vine would have provided additional</page><page sequence="10">316 security to the region's subsistence farmers. Cultivated olives and grapes appear in the Near East in the fourth millennium B.C. and in the Aegean region in the third. Their intro? duction into Spain is generally considered to have been deferred until the first millennium B.C. [80]. Seeds of grapes are known from Copper Age Monte de la Barsella (in Alicante) and of olive from El G?rcel and El Argar. Olive wood is reported from Los Miliares [81 ]. All are considered to be from wild plants, which are native to the southeast. The main character for determining that grape and olive seeds are domestic is that they are larger and somewhat longer than wild specimens (although there is considerable overlap) [82]. It must be realized, however, that domestic olives and grapes are simply phenotypically favorable wild ones reproduced by cuttings. As a consequence, other aspects affecting the phenotype of the cultivars, such as the conditions under which they are cultivated, may affect seed size. The scattered palaeobotanical evidence may, there? fore, be read to indicate the presence as easily as the absence of domesticates. Serious con? sideration should be given to the possibility that vine and olive culture were introduced into southeast Spain during the course of the archaeological sequence we are examining. There are, in my opinion, some convincing arguments to suggest that such an introduction took place. As we have seen, Mediterranean polyculture was practiced in the Aegean by the mid-third millennium B.C. [83]. A settle? ment pattern qualitatively similar to that of Roman times (when Mediterranean polyculture was certainly practiced) was achieved in central Italy by the second millennium B.C. [84]. Why should we assume that the diffusion of such an eminently practical art stopped short of the Iberian peninsula for another thousand years? Another line of circumstantial evidence is the nature of Argaric burial inventories. Much has been made of their similarity to the grave goods of Early Bronze Age Anatolia and the Aegean ? the drinking chalices in particular are linked [85]. In the eastern area these chalices no doubt would have contained wine; in ritual terms they represent a preoccupation of the living with this valued, pleasurable com? modity. The presence of the same cups in the Argaric may as easily reflect a similarity of preoccupation as the arrival of metal traders from the east. In general, there is a similarity between the Bronze Ages in the eastern Mediterranean and in southeast Spain, as the plethora of diffusionist arguments demonstrates. Many of these similarities may exist because the cultivation of the olive and the vine had parallel social consequences in both areas. CONCLUSIONS It is hypothesized that irrigation and Mediterranean polyculture were introduced during the course of the later prehistoric sequence in southeast Spain. Both would increase and stabilize agricultural yields, improving the productive capacity of the groups who adopted them. At the same time, investment in these productive forces would exacerbate the insecurity which generally be? sets primitive societies. In the effort to increase the security of their production, communities in the southeast undertook intensification of their agricultural practices. Their effort to increase their material security would, however, have increased their social insecurity, the vulnerability of those communities to the attacks of their enemies and the importunities of their friends. The benefits of an intensified agriculture could only be enjoyed within a new framework of productive relations. It is the achievement of this new framework which is reflected in the Almeria/Argar transition. The initial agricultural settlement of Almeria took place in the fourth millennium B.C. At this time irrigation would have been introduced. Households of the earlier Almerian express the group solidarity required in their productive activities by burying the dead in collective tombs with unelaborate ritual and utilitarian</page><page sequence="11">317 inventories. In the later Almerian the same pattern continues, but shows the strain new productive forces impose on the traditional social order. The megalithic tombs become larger; a wide variety of exotic material is procured for inclusion in burial inventories; utilitarian items included with the dead are sometimes fashioned of valuable copper; dif? ferences between the richness of tombs are striking. It is in the later Almerian that Mediterranean polyculture may have been introduced. It is clear that these new productive forces increased the wealth of domestic groups, but this continues to be expressed within the ritual framework of earlier times, now intensified in an attempt to meet the new demands placed upon it. In Argaric times, the contradictions worked themselves out. There was no new intensifica? tion of agricultural production. Developments in technology were in the realm of metallurgy, a craft in the service of an elite of warriors, who are now entombed in their citadels with their personal finery. This evolution toward social stratification took place in the southeast faster than in areas of Spain where intensifica? tion of farming would have produced much less dramatic benefits. Areas of dry farming were able to maintain the traditional social order. In central and western Andalusia and in Catalonia, for example, collective burials continued to be the prevailing practice well into the second millennium B.C. [86]. The transformations of prehistoric cultures in southeast Spain, then, are the dynamic result of their internal development; we need not have undue recourse to the stimulus of the Orient. This reading of the archaeological record remains, of course, to be verified or disproved by further evidence from appropriate sites, but it is clear that a dialectical and materialist interpretation of the available facts, a method peculiarly useful for archaeology, is the only route to a progressive understanding of the complex processes involved.
