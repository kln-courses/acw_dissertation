GRANT When this book first appeared in 1942 it was hailed as "... an invaluable book of reference - the last word upon an important field of study." - The Churchman. The Christian Science Monitor said: "Ripe scholarship, intimate knowledge of the sources, and a facile pen join to make attrac- tive to the reader whatever [Dr. Goodspeed] has written. This volume is no exception... illuminating and entertaining." Writings from the first century A.D. are divided according to literary forms such as letters, gospels, and revelations, while the later manuscripts are arranged according to authors and groups of authors. A new chapter on the contributions of Eusebius is included as well as Dr. Goodspeed's list of lost writings as yet undiscovered. However, many important dis- coveries have been made since this book was first published. These com- bined with modern scholarship bring this standard reference work up to date. Anyone interested in the literary achievements of the early Christians and the influence this literature has had on modern Chris- tianity will find this revised edition indispensable. 224 pages, Paper $1.95, Cloth $5.95 THE BOOK OF GOD AND MAN A Study of Job By ROBERT GORDIS "This magnificent study of one of the greatest literary masterpieces of all time cannot fail to thrill every serious student of the Book of Job or anyone deeply concerned about the enigmas of human existence. Job will take on new meaning and relevance not from pat answers, but from a deep understanding born of broad human experience and an accurate and extensive knowledge of the literature and literary forms of the ancient Semitic world.... Equally as translator, [Gordis] proves himself a sensitive literary artist... no one in recent years has come closer." - Library Journal. 389 pages, $8.50 SHORTER LEXICON OF THE GREEK NEW TESTAMENT By F. W. GINGRICH The Arndt-Gingrich translation (1957) of W. Bauer's monumental A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature filled a need that had been felt for over half a century. It was highly acclaimed by reviewers and is considered by all English-speaking New Testament scholars- of whatever school- to be the best of its kind. Dr. Gingrich has now produced a shorter version that will help bring the dictionary within the means of all serious students of the Greek New Testament. 241 pages, $4.50 UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS Chicago, Illinois I rl ? ?I ? ? a ?
