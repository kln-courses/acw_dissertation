Paper. xiii + 168 pp. Nuevos Horizontes is a well designed intermediate reader which contains eighteen short stories by Chi- cano, Cuban, and Puerto Rican authors who were born, have lived in the past, or are currently living in the United States. The range of Hispanic experience portrayed in this reader is remarkable. It includes rural life in New Mexico, migrant workers in the Midwest and Cali- fornia, prerevolutionary and revolutionary Cuba, urban life in Puerto Rico and New York, and rural life in Puerto Rico and Cuba. Themes treated by the authors include witchcraft, death, machismo, ado- lescent sexuality, child psychology, the military draft during the Vietnam war, faith and creativity in the face of despair and death, cultural decay and cul- tural vigor. In Por qud cundid brujeria mala, the author skillfully weaves anthropomorphism, personi- fication, invocation of ancestors, the motif of the avenging axe, and a tragic ironic ending, to offer an explanation for the spread of evil witchcraft. Santa Clo va a La Cuchilla, in a humorous tone, illustrates culture conflict in a rural Puerto Rican school. Cajas de cart6n is a powerful evocation of the tragic ex- perience of a California family. The narrator skill- fully draws the reader in to identify with him. The reader feels empathy and outrage about the experi- ences of these people. El adversario takes place on a flight from Puerto Rico to New York. It represents a mortal contest between the narrator and death itself. Characterization, plot development, symbol- ism of numbers and colors, and verbal irony, are all combined to make it a superb story. Aventuras de "Coquito" is a humorous story about a man, "Coqui- to," whose whole life revolved around eating sweets. He is a traveling salesman of candy who makes a point of attending as many wakes and funerals as he can in order to get free chocolate and other sweets. He goes to all the funerals even though he does not know the persons or the families involved. He finally gets his comeuppance at the funeral for the nanny of a rich family. Each story is preceded by a black and white photo- graph illustrating the title, a photo of the author, and a biographical sketch of the author. The photos of the authors could be improved in future editions. Considerable thought and expertise are demonstrated in the editing of each selection, which has been chosen for a specific theme, colloquial language, structural complexity, and length. A listing of the stories by level of difficulty is given in the introduction. The marginal notes and footnotes are indeed helpful and pertinent. They indicate significant differences in idiomatic usage and cultural and linguistic traits among Chicanos, Puerto Ricans and Cubans. The exercises following each story are of consistent quality throughout the text and include sentence-completion, vocabulary practice, fifteen questions based on the contents of the story, personalized questions which evoke self-expression, and finally a directed com- position, which supplies a theme based on the story and an outline as aids to composition. Nuevos Hori- zontes ends with a Spanish-English appendix of Modismos comunes y expresiones Wtiles, and a Span- ish-English vocabulary which defines words according to their contextual usage. Nuevos Horizontes is a valuable intermediate read- er; it introduces some first-class storytellers to inter- mediate students. Students should gain an increased awareness of the richness and diversity of the litera- ture, life, and culture of the three major ethnic groups. EUGENE C.
