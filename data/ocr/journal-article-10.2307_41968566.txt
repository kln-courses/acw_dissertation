Closely related to these are C. runyonii, C. harperi, C. plattensis, and C. sandwichiana, as well as C. obtusiflora var. glandulosa and C. polygonorum. Cuscuta runyonii, C. harperi, and C. sandwichiana are relatively narrow endemics, C. plattensis and C.glabrior have wider but apparently discrete ranges, while C. obtusiflora var. glandulosa, C. polygonorum, and especially C. pentagona and G campestris are widespread and broadly sympatric in North America, at least in some regions. Cuscuta campestris is one of the most widespread species in the world, being additionally recorded from South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia. Comparisons among these nine species are presented as a key and as comparative descriptions. SEM images are provided for flowers, fruits, seeds, and pollen. RESUMEN Cuscuta pentagona, G campestris, y C.glabrior son taxa fuertemente semejantes, reconocidos aqui como especies. Estrechamente relacionadas con éstas están G runyonii, C. harperi, y C. plattensis así como también C. obtusiflora var. glandulosa y C. polygonorum. Cuscuta runyonii, C. harperi y C. sandwichiana son endémicas con áreas pequeñas, C. plattensis y C.glabrior tienen rangos geográficos más amplios pero aparentemente distintos, mientras que C. obtusiflora var. glandulosa, C. polygonorum, y especialmente C. pentagona y G campestris son comunes y ampliamente simpátricas en Norteamérica, al menos en algunas regiones. Cuscuta campestris ocurre fuera de Norteamérica, siendo mencionada de Sudamérica, Europa, Asia, Africa, y Australia. Las comparaciones entre estos seis taxa se presentan en forma de clave y descripciones comparativas. Se ofrecen imágenes de SEM de las flores, frutos, semillas, y polen. Engelmann (1859) distinguished three varieties of Cuscuta pentagona Engelm. in addition to the typical form: var. calycina, var. verrucosa, and var. microcalyx. Yuncker (1932, 1965) treated var. calycina and var. verrucosa at specific rank but provided a new name for each: C. campestris Yuncker (nom. nov.) and C. SIDA 22(1): 151 -175. 2006</page><page sequence="2">152 BRIT.ORG/SIDA 22(1) glabrior (Engelm.) Yuncker (comb, nov.), respectively. He treated var. microcalyx as a synonym of typical C. pentagona . Recent studies have not recognized C. campestris at any rank (e.g., Beliz 1986; Gandhi et al. 1987), while C glabrior has been regarded as a variety of C. pentagona (Gandhi et al. 1987) or as nomencla- tural synonym of C. indecora Choisy var. neuropetala (Engelm.) Hitchc. (Beliz 1986). Three other species from North America, C. harperi Small, C. plattensis A. Neis., and G runyonii Yuncker, were included by Yuncker in the same group (subsect. Arvenses Yuncker) with G pentagona and G campestris (Yuncker 1965). Although G runyonii has been considered a good species by all authors, G harperi and G plattensis were treated by Beliz in her Ph.D. dissertation (1986) as nomenclatural synonyms of "G. pentagona var. polygonorum" and G indecora , respectively. The current paper is the second of several to present taxonomie analyses of Cuscuta species groups and complexes. The first (Costea et al. 2005) gave an assessment of Cuscuta nevadensis and Cuscuta veatchii; three others follow in this issue (Costea et al 2006a, b,c). Other two papers that are now in preparation will deal with the phylogeny of Cuscuta and its infrageneric taxonomy, includ- ing the formal delimitation of the groups of species treated in the four papers published in this issue. Evaluations of the status of all these taxa are necessary for the accounts of Cuscuta in the Flora of North America and the forthcoming revision of The Jepson Manual (California). The comments below on reproduc- tive biology and taxonomy are in perspective of the whole genus. REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY AND TAXONOMY OF CUSCUTA Scarcity of information regarding the reproductive biology of Cuscuta species limits progress toward understanding the taxonomy and evolution of this ge- nus. For example, a detailed study of floral biology is available only for C. attenuata Waterfall (Prather &amp; Tyrl 1993), which is very closely related to to C. indecora. Although they may be sympatric over an extensive geographical range, species such as G campestris and C. pentagona have never been found "growing together at the same site" (Musselman 1986). Apparently a single her- baceous host cannot support more than one parasite (often a single Cuscuta plant simultaneously parasitizes several different host plants), although it does not seem impossible that colonies of different Cuscuta species might exist side by side. Furthermore, although some species (e.g., C. epithymum Murray, C. rostrata Shuttlw. ex Engelm. &amp; A.Gray) have been reported to be pollinated by insects (Beliz 1986; Musselman 1986; Holm et al. 1997), others such as C. pentagona and its relatives apparently are autogamous (Verdcourt 1948; Beliz 1986; Musselman 1986; Prather &amp; Tyrl 1993; Dawson et al. 1994). In the G pentagona complex, we observed that anthers dehisce longitudinally before flowers open, further substantiating previous observations of autogamy. The low pollen/ovule ratio (= 65) found by Beliz (1986) in C. pentagona (including G.</page><page sequence="3">COSTEA ET AL., TAXONOMY OF CUSCUTA PENTAGONA COMPLEX 153 campestris ) supports the idea that autogamy may be common (see Cruden 19 77). The occurrence of inbreeding may help explain the relatively high num- ber of taxa (species and varieties) that are recognizable as morphological enti- ties in Cuscuta. The existence of intermediate-like plants observed rarely in populations of the G pentagona complex probably reflects populational vari- ability in closely related taxa. Hybridization also is a possible explanation, but experimental attempts to produce hybrids (e.g. between G indecora and G attenuata) have failed (Prather &amp; Tyrl 1993). Seed dispersal of many Cuscuta species seems unspecialized (Kuijt 1969). "Natural" means of seed dispersal are unknown. Lyshede (1984) suggested that wind may play a significant role in dispersal because of the pits present on the seed coat of dry seeds. However, Cuscuta seeds do not possess "classical" adap- tations for wind dispersal, and the alveolate/papillate seed coat seems more an adaptation related to the germination process (Costea &amp; Tardif 2006). Kuijt (1969) mentioned that seeds remain viable while they pass through the diges- tive system of sheep, but Gómez (1994) in Sierra Nevada, Spain, reported that hosts infested with G epithymum were avoided by the Spanish ibex, the main herbivore in the area. Herbivores may avoid plants infested with Cuscuta be- cause of the yellowish color (Costea &amp; Tardif 2006). Capsules and seeds of Cuscuta float, and although water dispersal has never clearly been documented, it may occur only in the species that prefer the vicinity of water, such as C. gronovii Willd. ex J. A. Schult. Dispersal over long distances of weed species such as C. campestris has been connected with anthropomorphic activities. The prin- cipal means of world-wide dispersal of Cuscuta weeds has been through con- taminated seeds of forage legumes (alfalfa, clover, and lespedeza, especially Les- pedeza cuneata (Dumont) G. Don; reviewed by Dawson et al. 1994; Costea &amp; Tardif 2006). Furthermore, when wetted, the seed coat in Cuscuta species be- comes papillose-gelatinous and adheres easily to soil particles, and seeds may thus be carried by farm machinery (Costea &amp; Tardif 2006). METHODS Descriptions of morphology and micromorphology are based mostly on speci- mens from herbarium NY, which includes Yuncker's herbarium (Appendix 1). Measurements of floral parts except anthers were done on rehydrated her- barium material. Length of flowers was measured from the base of calyx to the tip of straightened corolla lobes. Pollen, anthers, seeds, and capsules were mea- sured on SEM pictures taken with a scanning electron microscope Hitachi S- 570 at 15 KV. Samples were coated with 30 nm gold using an Emitech K 550 sputter coater. Standard terminology for cell types and surface sculpturing pat- terns follows Barthlott et al. (1998); pollen terminology follows Hoen (1999). Conservation status was assessed using NatureServe (2005) ranks and criteria. Identification of Cuscuta often is a lengthy process because rehydration of</page><page sequence="4">154 BRIT.ORG/SIDA 22(1) flowers, dissection, and examination under a microscope are usually necessary. Variation may be expected on the same individual (e.g., Gandhi &amp; Thomas 1983; Severova 1991). Furthermore, because flowers do not mature simultaneously, the size and ratios between different floral parts on the same plant may vary to some extent. A range of flowers, fruits, and seeds belonging to the same plant should be examined. The angled calyx of G pentagona and G harperi is best observed in flower and during early fructification; full development of capsules may obscure the character. MICROMORPHOLOGY Flowers and capsules.- Laticifers, papillae, and multicellular protuberances may occur on the floral parts and capsules and distinctions between these features can be important in recognizing members of the C. pentagona complex (mag- nification of 100 X or more recommended). Laticifers are visible in the calyx and sometimes in the corolla and capsules of all taxa. Yuncker usually referred to them as "pellucid glandular-appearing cells" (Yuncker 1921, 1932, 1965). La- ticifers may appear isolated, rotund, ovoidal or tangentially elongated, or they can be organized in rows (Fig. 1 c,e). Laticifers from the stems are perivascular, multinucleate, and articulated (Lyshede 1985). Papillae are more or less radi- ally elongated cells, and they are present in the calyces, corollas, and capsules of C. harperi , C.glabrior, and C. runyonii (Fig. 1 e,f; 2 a,b,c). Multicellular protu- berances are larger and they may occur in C. runyonii along the midveins of the calyx lobes (Fig. 2c). Epicuticular wax on the perianth, when present, is repre- sented by longitudinally reticulated rodlets (Fig. If). Pollen. - Pollen is relatively uniform among species. Grains are 3(- 4)- zonocolpate (rarely 4-6 loxocolporate in aberrant grains), and they may be poly- morphic in the same anther or flower, from spheroidal to prolate (Fig. 3). Orna- mentation varies from tectum imperforatum or with a few puncta in C.glabrior , G runyonii, and G plattensis , to tectum perforatum in C. pentagona , G. campestris , G. harperi , and C. obtusißora var. glandulosa (Fig. 3). The latter three species have sexine often persistent in punctum apertures (Fig. 3). Cuscuta pentagona and G obtusißora var. glandulosa have the largest puncta, up to 0.7 jim in diam- eter, sometimes approaching a microreticulate ornamentation (Fig. 3). Seeds. - A striking feature of the seed coat epidermis is that when seeds dry, cells of the outer cell wall invaginate, which causes the seed surface to be- come alveolate (Fig. 4; see also Lyshede 1984; Knepper et al. 1990; Costea &amp; Tardif 2006). Water uptake induces bulging of the invaginated epidermal walls, and epidermis cells become swollen and papillose (Fig. 4c). The diameter of seed coat epidermal cells is 17-50 |im in G pentagona , G campestris , C.glabrior , G runyonii , and G harperi and 15-20 ļim in G plattensis , G obtusißora var. glandulosa , and C. polygonorum. The seeds of G runyonii and G polygonorum have epicuticular wax organized as longitudinal rodlets (Fig. 4d), a feature not</page><page sequence="5">COSTEA ET AL., TAXONOMY OF CUSCUTA PENTAGONA COMPLEX 155 Fig. 1 .a.

The corolla is persistent at the base of the capsules or surrounding them. Cuscuta sandwichiana , a Hawaiian endemic, was placed by Yuncker (1932) in subsect. Californicae because it exhibits a reduction of the infrastaminal scales similar to the other species (C. sandwichiana was omitted in his 1965 treat- ment). This species, however, does not appear to be evolutionarily allied to G californica complex. Beliz (1986) hypothesized that G sandwichiana has evolved from G cephalanthi Engelm., which is a member of the C.gronovii Willd. ex Roem. &amp; Schult, complex. However, the stems of G sandwichiana grow and branch as in species of the G pentagona complex: the main and secondary stems grow continuously and never twine around the host. Instead, tendril-like branches produced from axillary buds of the rudimentary leaf -scales fix the parasite to the host. In C.gronovii and its relatives (e.g., C. cephalanthi , G umbrosa Beyr. ex Hook., and G rostrata Shuttlw. ex Engelm. &amp; A. Gray), haustoria are formed as the main stem twines around the host, and no tendril-like axillary branches are generated (as first observed by Dawson 1984 in C.gronovii). The calyx and corolla of C. sandwichiana are relatively similar in morphology to those of G campestris , although flowers are larger in G sandwichiana. Seeds of G sandwichiana are commonly angled, like those of G campestris , and not dor- soventrally compressed as in G cephalanthi. Contrary to some relatively recent treatments (e.g. Austin 1986; Musselman 1986), G campestris has not been accepted as a distinct taxon in modern North American overviews of the genus (Beliz 1986; Gandhi et al. 1987; Kartesz et al. 1999; USD A NRCS 2004). This judgment has been based on the allegedly vari- able morphology of the calyx, which was the main character used by Yuncker to differentiate this taxon from G pentagona s. str. Beliz (1986) wrote: "The angled calyx (of G pentagona s. str.) is not a constant feature, it is present in some flow- ers and absent on others in an individual; ... this feature may be an artifact cre- ated when flowers dry out." In contrast, we have found the angled calyx of G pentagona to be a remarkably constant feature (Fig. lb). Because the calyx lobes of G campestris are overlapping, the calyx sometimes may appear angled in pressed flowers, but if the flowers are hydrated, the calyx usually appears "rounded" (Fig. la). The prominent angles of the calyx in G pentagona are the result of a different morphology of the calyx lobes (Fig.lb). Furthermore, small but consistent differences in the size of floral parts, pollen, capsules, and seeds (see key below) usually separate the two taxa. Size overlap between the two taxa does occur, as well as intermediate-like plants, although the latter are uncom- mon. Austin (1979) discussed methods of pressing to avoid obscuring calyx traits in all species, but particularly in G pentagona and G. campestris. Four years before Yuncker formally recognized Cuscuta campestris as a separate species from G pentagona , he was aware that his taxonomie solution might be received with reluctance. In a letter addressed to WC. Ferguson, accom-</page><page sequence="10">160 BRIT.ORG/SIDA 22(1) panying a collection of C. campestris sent to him for identification ( Ferguson 7795 , NY), Yuncker (1929) wrote: "I suspect I will be accused of various bad tendencies in the way of species making, but I think I have clarified the 'arvensis' situation somewhat." The assessment presented here also finds that C. campestris is con- sistently distinct from C. pentagona , although differences may seem subtle, and we believe their recognition as species best reflects the biological situation. Similarly, Cuscuta campestris may be sometimes difficult to distinguish from C.glabrior , but the two taxa can be usually differentiated using a combi- nation of features indicated in the key and descriptions. Cuscuta runyonii is most similar to C. glabrior , and C. harperi to G pentagona (see descriptions; Yuncker 1932; 1942). Cuscuta plattensis does not appear to be evolutionarily al- lied to G indecora , in contrast to the suggestion by Beliz (1986). Yuncker (1932, p. 140) considered G plattensis to be "very closely related" to G campestris. The morphology of seeds of G indecora is different from the species of G pentagona complex and more similar to that of Cgronovii and its relatives. Two North American taxa previously treated within Cuscuta subsect. Platycarpae (Yuncker 1932), G obtusiflora var. glandulosa Engelm. and G polygonorum Engelm., are included here in subsect. Arvenses on the basis of their overall morphological similarity with the other species of this subsection. This close relationship was also emphasized by Beliz (1986), who referred to G polygonorum as "G pentagona var. polygonorum ," within which G harperi was included as a synonym. In contrast, we found that although G polygonorum and G obtusiflora var. glandulosa apparently are related to the species of subsect. Arvenses , each is clearly delimited morphologically. Cuscuta australis R. Br. from Australia and Asia, which is known only from one collection in North America (Jefferson Co., New York, 1926, M uenscher s.n ., NY), probably belongs to this group of species as well. This latter species has not been included in this taxo- nomie treatment limited in scope to North America. In the Cuscuta pentagona complex, there are three relatively narrow endemics (G runyonii , G harperi , and G sandwichiana), two with wider but apparently discrete ranges (G plattensis and C.glabrior ), and four species (G pentagona , G campestris, C. polygonorum, and G obtusiflora var. glandulosa ) widely distrib- uted and broadly sympatric, at least in some regions. The exact North Ameri- can distributions of G campestris and G pentagona, particularly, require addi- tional f loristic study. For additional synonymy see Yuncker (1932, 1965).

The protologue noted that var. glabrior [was growing] "with the preceding variety [i.e., C. verrucosa var. hispidula], F. Lindheimer : on Petalostemon, Drummond (3rd collection, No. 247)." Choice of the Drummond collection (III, 247) as lectotype of Cuscuta verrucosa Engelm. var. glabrior has been associated with Yuncker (1921), but there Yuncker instead chose the Drummond type for C.pentagona var. verrucosa, citing C. verrucosa var. glabrior as a synonym.

Engelmann described C. verrucosa and two varieties of it: var. hispidula (treated by us as C. indecora var. indecora) and var. glabrior. He cited collections associated with both varieties but none for C. verrucosa in its typical form. In 1859, in valid use of the epithet as C. arvensis var. verrucosa, he cited "Texas, Drummond! III. 247; Lindheimer! 127" and others as syntypes. Yuncker (1921, p. 52), under the combination C. pentagona var. verrucosa, indicated that "Drummond III 247" at MO was the type (lectotype).

Conservation status- G4G5 (the same assessment in NatureServe 2005). According to Yuncker (1965, p. 6), Cuscuta pentagona var. pubescens (Engelm.) Yuncker "represents the extreme degree of papillation which covers the flower and extends down onto the pedicels. In var. glabrior the ovary and capsules are almost always more or less papillate while the corolla shows con- siderable variation in this character." We find continuous variation, and two varieties cannot be separated. Occasional plants that are hardly papillate can be distinguished from C. campestris by their calyx lobes, which are broadly triangular-lanceolate and not overlapping at the base and by the corolla envel- oping the mature capsule (Fig. 2a). 5.
