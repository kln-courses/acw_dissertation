<plain_text><page sequence="1">diaries enlighten us here? Are there figures to suggest that standing-room places were sold? The book is handsomely produced, and the type is clear throughout. The dust-jacket features a little-known contemporary engraving of the Burg- theater, augmenting the stock of those currently in circulation. Facsimile reproductions of 'Theater- zettl' would have been a welcome addition since, based on the few excerpts scattered throughout the volume, these printed advertisements appear to be important 'living' documents. While reproductions cannot possibly stand for the real thing, a sampling of these uncatalogued records from the Theater- museum in Vienna would have conveyed more than the broken threads and severed meanings presented here. The obsession with documentary studies relat- ing to Mozart (whose Viennese years roughly define the parameters of this study) shows little sign of abating. While studies revelling in positiv- ism usually manage to unearth much new informa- tion and rarely fail to correct past misinformation, they too often brush aside or avoid altogether deeper issues relating to the nature and conceptual foundation of transcription itself-a subjective and speculative process that communicates only limited indications of the past. Whether enacted on text or notation, the pitfalls of transcription are legion, as our colleagues working in the fields of world music, jazz and chant studies are well aware. Hiding behind a chimera of restoration, transcription wrests texts from a distant heritage, sanitizes and commodifies them and then disseminates them under the pretext of advancing knowledge. Too frequently, transcription of a document attends to only one meaning of it-its 'facts'-and pays little heed to the dislocation, discrimination and re- creation of history involved in the endeavour. Inscribed here are the makings of history, not history itself. The vitality of the National Court Theatre, including its rich repertory and colourful community of officials, performers and patrons, lies buried not only within the minutiae of countless archival documents and records, some of which are presented here, but also within our own construc- tions of that material. Dorothea Link's invaluable accompanying commentary and annotations begin to explore this vitality, and her meticulous Perform- ance Calendar and other sources presented here will benefit those committed to their tasks as historians. CARYL L. CLARK Concerto Conversations. By Joseph Kerman. pp. 175; CD. (Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Mass., &amp; London, 1999, $24.95. ISBN 0-674- 15891-1.) There can be few musicologists better qualified than Joseph Kerman to deliver Harvard Univer- sity's prestigious Charles Eliot Norton Lectures. One of the most influential and controversial figures in post-war Anglo-American musicology, Kerman has rarely strayed from scholarly view, making seminal contributions to a diverse range of academic topics. In addition, he has a proven ability to write comprehensibly and eloquently for non-specialists (his ever-popular Listen, first published in 1972, is a case in point)-an import- ant requirement for the project at hand. Never one to shirk a challenge, Kerman chose a suitably challenging topic for the 1997-8 lecture series expanded into the book under review: the concerto. Studies of the concerto as a genre are few and far between, not least for the obvious reason that it has changed considerably over its 300-year history. But Kerman, painting with a broad brush, compares and contrasts a commendable number of stylistically diverse works. Some composers are conspicuous by their absence-Handel gets short shrift, for example-and Baroque and Classical works receive fewer extended analyses than their nineteenth- and twentieth-century counterparts. Kerman's emphasis on later works is justified, however, as it begins to redress a prevailing schol- arly imbalance; mid-to-late nineteenth-century and twentieth-century concertos have often been mar- ginalized for their excessive showmanship and generic complexity respectively. Concerto Conversations is organized along them- atic, rather than chronological or stylistic lines and opens, appropriately enough, with the chapter 'Getting Started'. Examining how composers begin concertos and how they bring in their soloists, Kerman identifies a number of strangely anticlimactic moments at the openings of Saint- Saens's, Rakhmaninov's and Tchaikovsky's works, and considers the initial ritomellos of Baroque and Classical concertos in terms of 'polarity' and 'reci- procity', concepts elaborated later in the book. He explains that straightforward reciprocity was 'too tame . . . too Classical' (p. 13) for Beethoven, and expands upon this point in considering the Piano Concerto No. 3 in C minor. Tracing the reappear- ances of the striking solo entry across the first movement, Kerman describes its pivotal signific- ance as a 'fluid vinculum holding together a structure that is in fact otherwise stiff and mini- mally expressive'. Beethoven creates an impression 450</page><page sequence="2">of circularity: 'the piano's beginning ... is its end' (p. 16). Chapters 2 and 3 explore closely related themes involving the interaction of the solo and the orches- tra. Chapter 2 addresses 'Particularity and Polar- ity', which Kerman defines respectively as 'the distinctive characteristics of the solo and the orchestra in any particular context' (p. 23) and as a type of 'duality' whereby the agents 'do not engage with each other' (p. 24). Kerman detects 'polarity' in Baroque concertos and subsequently in twentieth-century works such as Stravinsky's Concerto for piano and wind instruments and Bart6k's Piano Concerto No. 2. The solo/orchestra relationship in the Stravinsky concerto, parodying and paying homage to Vivaldian polarity in equal measure at the beginning of the first movement, develops in a particularly original and distinctive fashion; the piano, 'disciplined' by the orchestra at the end of the first movement, humanized in the second and 'full of fight' in the third, behaves like Petrushka's dancing puppet (p. 32). Evolving solo/ orchestra relationships and their programmatic implications are expanded in Chapter 3, 'Recipro- city, Roles, and Relationships'. For Kerman, 'reci- procity' in late eighteenth- and nineteenth-century concertos-marked by a 'sense of engagement' (p. 41)-replaces polarity as the characteristic mode of solo/orchestra interaction. Explaining reciprocal processes such as 'replay', 'counterplay' and 'coplay' and their relevance to rondo and first- movement form, Kerman widens the lens through which solo/orchestra interaction is generally viewed by proposing that a wide array of fresh tropes 'derived by analogy from human relation- ships' enter critical discourse (p. 50). His sub- sequent account of the 'relationship story' of Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto traces the orches- tra's evolution from slave to critic, making liberal use of anthropomorphic description to explain the stages in between. In Chapters 4 and 5 Kerman turs his attention from solo/orchestra relations to musical issues- virtuosity and texture-particularly relevant to the concerto genre. Just as he broadens critical dis- course on instrumental relations, so he extends the concept of virtuosity to include the Italian term virtu. Interpreting the three components of virtu as bravura, mimesis and spontaneity, Kerman segues neatly into a discussion of the concerto cadenza, identifying an overall reduction in the level of spontaneity in those of the nineteenth and twenti- eth centuries. In contrast, 'Diffusion: Concerto Textures' examines the erosion rather than rein- forcement of solo/orchestra distinctions. Beginning with Beethoven, Kerman explains how 'the singu- larity of the soloist came increasingly into question' (p.85) in nineteenth- and twentieth-century works with the emergence of 'secondary soloists' and of unified concerto textures in which the constituent solo and orchestral parts are inseparable. Kerman's final chapter, 'The Sense of an Ending', investigates the numerous ways in which concerto composers bring their works to a close. The finale of Mozart's D minor Piano Concerto K.466 moves away from the standard 'mutual rondo' (characterized by reciprocal solo and orchestral statements of the main thematic mater- ial), as the orchestra is continually unsuccessful in its attempt to restate the piano's entry theme. Nineteenth-century composers, with the exception of Brahms, also abandon the 'mutual rondo' in favour of triumphant endings and endings with sublime and religious connotations. In the twenti- eth century, Walton, Berg, Hindemith, Britten and Shostakovich incorporate the theme of lamentation into the final movements of their concertos, while Elliott Carter ends his Piano Concerto (1965) apocalyptically. The general reader will find much to admire in Concerto Conversations. Kerman is engaging and often humorous and successfully retains the con- versational element of his lectures in their written form. Moreover, his written prose is as elegant as the musical prose of many of the great works he discusses. Like Tovey before him, he has the uncanny knack in his analyses of being able to express in one or two exquisitely crafted sentences what it would take a lesser writer far longer to articulate. For concerto specialists and other musicologists, however, doubts will loom. While Kerman's histor- ical generalizations and relative lack of historically sensitive discussion are not shortcomings in them- selves, they tend nevertheless to draw attention to weaknesses in his general approach. In answer to the crucial question 'What is a concerto?' (p. 18), he takes the Harvard Dictionary of Music as his point of departure, rather than considerably more illu- minating explanations in eighteenth- and nine- teenth-century music dictionaries and treatises, which in turn would have suggested interpretative avenues of investigation into concerto relationships. Equally, Kerman's attempt to categorize solo/ orchestra interaction in terms of polarity and reciprocity in particular historical periods some- times marginalizes interesting and provocative interaction that departs from the historical norm. While his characterization of the solo exposition of the Classical concerto-'The solo, in cooperation with the orchestra, re-engages with that material and edits it, subtracting some bits, adding new bits 451</page><page sequence="3">of its own' (p. 47)-is largely accurate, for example, it fails to account for the intriguing moments of confrontation in, say, Mozart's Piano Concertos K.450, 467 and 482. Above all, the free interpret- ative rein that Kerman allows himself in discussing concerto relationships in Chapter 3, and which he readily admits might 'seem fanciful' (p. 50), could have been held in check by a more thorough consideration of the critical resonances of indi- vidual terms such as 'eavesdropper, tease, survivor, victim, mourner or pleurant, minx, lover, critic, editor' (loc. cit.). As it stands, Kerman's 'relation- ship story' for the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto, for example, is a fascinating read, but would have been more convincing from an interpretative perspective had he explained how and why he chose certain descriptive metaphors rather than other, related ones. That said, Kerman often compensates for the absence of historical rigour with interpretative rigour and imagination. Chapter 4 offers the best case in point. Kerman is quite right to insist on a more positive evaluation of virtuosity than is gen- erally offered by critics and uses virtz to this end in a careful and methodical fashion. Virtuosity is intelligently reclaimed as a central component of concerto aesthetics, in a manner illuminating for both scholar and general reader alike. Given the wide audience at which Kerman's book is aimed it is perhaps inevitable that he should miss several opportunities to elaborate his analytical interpretations. On occasion, however, his line of argument seems to require expansion in order to realize its full effect. While solo and orchestral agents in the first movement of Stravinsky's Concerto for piano and wind instru- ments have a common intent, both 'mocking' music of the late nineteenth century (p. 28), they initially form a polarity, an anomaly that Kerman does not explore, but one-given the uniqueness of the neo-Classical style-that could feed into as convincing a narrative reading along stylistic lines as Kerman's interpretation of the dancing puppet along programmatic lines. In Chapter 5, the inevi- table outcome of the increasing diffusion charted by Kerman-'complete diffusion' in which 'duality vanishes' (p. 96)-heralds only a single paragraph on twentieth-century concertos for orchestra. The trajectory of the chapter as a whole cries out for more extended musical discussion here, particu- larly given the high repute in which Bart6k's concerto is justifiably held. More disappointing are the final pages of Kerman's last chapter, which descend into somewhat opportunistic mil- lennial speculation. His thoughts about the future of the DVD disc or the Schwann Catalogue seem largely irrelevant to the project at hand, and the one comment about the future of concerto listen- ing-'Concertos will be heard when they are not played and not seen, or seldom played, or never played-but the artists who once did play them will live on, because of recorded sound' (p. 125)-- seems curiously banal. If Kerman wanted to end on a speculative note, could he not have focused exclusively on the concerto, tentatively predicting the future of the genre in the wake of Carter's devastating work? Whatever its strengths and weaknesses, Concerto Conversations is a thoroughly engaging and imagin- ative trip over tricky terrain, which Kerman carries off with characteristic interpretative panache. It is provocative and opinionated to the end-we would have expected no less from the author of contro- versial classics such as Musicology (Contemplating Music in American editions) and Opera as Drama. SIMON P. KEEFE Von der 'Silvana' zum 'Freischiitz' Die Konzertarian, die Einlagen zu Opern und die Schauspielmusik Carl Maria von Webers. By Oliver Huck. pp. xii + 407. 'Weber-Studien', ed. by Gerhard Allroggen &amp; Joachim Veit, v. (Schott, Mainz, 1999, DM98 (subscription price DM78.50). ISBN 3-7957-- 0381-6.) As parerga to work on the new Carl Maria von Weber Gesamtausgabe, there have been proceeding two different series of publications. One, Weberiana, consists of approximately annual Mitteilungen from the Internationale Weber Gesellschaft based in Berlin, with scholarly contributions and the fruits of research as well as news and reports of the greatly increased Weber activity, especially in Germany. Of greater substance are the hand- somely produced Weber-Studien, edited at the Gesamtausgabe's main base in Detmold, which have now reached a fifth volume. As well as comprising collections of disparate essays, they have concentrated on particular topics (in Vol. 4. the writings of the Harmonischer Verein formed by Weber and like-minded colleagues). At which point, I should declare disinterest: though a member of the Gesellschaft's Beirat, and editor of one work in the Gesamtausgabe, I have no editorial hand in the Weber-Studien. The newest volume is the 1997 doctoral disserta- tion of a young scholar whose interest has centred on one of the most neglected areas of Weber research, his concert arias and theatre music. There are good reasons for this being worthy of more attention than it has hitherto received. 452</page></plain_text>
