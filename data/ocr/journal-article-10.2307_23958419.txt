<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DOCTRINE OF REGULATIVE TRUTH AND MANSEL'S INTENTIONS There is no doubt that Mansel intends to free theology from any positive dependence on philosophy.1 On this point there is agreement between Mr. Cupitt and myself.2 Cupitt argues, however, that in my account of Mansel's theory of regulative truth in theology I fail to take sufficient note of his general intention. Mansel's theory on my inter pretation depends in large part upon his epistemological doctrines. But this view, Cupitt claims, can hardly be correct: for it would mean that Mansel, contrary to his general intention, is basing a theological doctrine upon certain philosophical views. 'How', Cupitt asks, 'can Mansel, on his own principles, make this all-important theological doc trine dependent upon a philosophical doctrine as to the nature and limits of thought ?3י There is, he allows, some evidence in Mansel's writings for such a view, but, since it fails to accord with what we know of Mansel's intentions and his debts to Butler and other Anglican writers, another more plausible 1 e.g. H. L. Mansel, The Limits of Religious Thought (5th edn., London, 1867), p. 10; 'Philosophy and Theology', Letters, Lectures, and Reviews (London, 1873), ed. H. W. Chandler, pp. 340 ff. 2 D.

N.S. xxii (1971), p. 545.</page><page sequence="2">454 NOTES AND STUDIES interpretation of the doctrine in its relation to his philosophy must be found. Cupitt finds the key to his interpretation in the fact that The Limits Limits of Religious Thought is a work of Christian apologetics by a disciple of Butler. The relationship between Mansel's theories of the limits of thought and regulative truth, he says, is one of analogy rather than support and dependence. They resemble one another in that they stand to their respective disciplines in the same way: regulative truths provide the limits of theological thought in a way analogous to the restrictions imposed upon philosophy by the limits of thought. But the relationship between the doctrines is no more than the analogy of proportionality. Supporting evidence for this view is to be found in the fact that doctrines of religious truth similar to Mansel's have been presented by other thinkers, especially some of his Anglican predecessors, who do not share his theory of the nature and limits of thought. 'My claim', Cupitt writes, 'is that the theory of regulative truth is a theological theory about the status of revelation. Mansel derives it from the theological tradition in which he was brought up, and in the course of his argument he associates it, for apologetic purposes, with an exposition of the limits of thought. The Bampton Lectures were delivered from a pulpit, and by a professed disciple of Butler.'1 The crucial point on which Mr. Cupitt bases his interpretation is the claim that Mansel's theory is a theological doctrine. But is this claim correct ? Should the doctrine be so described either by us or by Mansel ? And does Mansel in fact regard it as a peculiarly theological theory ? The answers to such questions show, I believe, that Cupitt's account of the relationship between Mansel's doctrine and his philosophy is neither called for by the logic of his position nor supported by the evidence of his writings. In order to see why, it is necessary, first, to consider briefly what might be meant by 'theological' and then to examine Mansel's writings on the nature of theology and the doctrine of regulative truth. On the first point, there seem to be at least two possible non-reductive views of the discipline of theology. The most natural, perhaps, is to regard it as a discipline which attempts to discover the truth about the nature and activities of a divine being or beings. On such a view state ments about the nature and status of the truths discovered are not strictly speaking theological but metatheological claims which belong to the philo sophy of theology. This view of theology, however, is not the only one which one might take. Theology can and probably should be regarded as the sort of discipline in which no useful purpose is served by distinguish ing first and second order claims into rigidly separate compartments. On this view Mansel's theory of regulative truth (in so far as it applies to Ibid., pp. 546-7.</page><page sequence="3">NOTES AND STUDIES 455 theology) could be called a theological doctrine, but it would still be necessary to indicate that it is 'talk about talk' and to explain how such claims differ in nature and basis from other types of claims made within the discipline.1 One difficulty in seeing how these distinctions apply to Mansel's thought is that he nowhere seems to have tried to state precisely his own views on the nature of theology. A consideration of his natural theology would seem to lead to the view that the boundaries between theology and philosophy overlap, since his account of the natural knowledge of God draws upon his theory of the limits of thought as well as his analysis of moral and religious experience. On such a view of theology there would be little difficulty in describing the theory of regulative truths in theology as a theological doctrine. Yet it is fairly clear that most of the time Mansel operates with a very different view of theology, one in which the concepts and evidence provided by natural religion and philosophy are regarded as merely a propaedeutic to theology proper. The discipline of theology according to this, his dominant view, is limited to the task of re-presenting and ordering the truths of revelation in scripture. 'The mind', Mansel writes, 'is ... unable to frame for itself any speculative representation of the Divine Essence; and for that very reason, Philosophy is not entitled, on internal evidence, to accept any, or to reject any. The only question which we are reasonably at liberty to ask in this matter, relates to the evidences of the Revelation as a fact. If there is sufficient evidence, on other grounds, to shew that the Scripture, in which this doctrine is contained, is a Revelation from God, the doctrine itself must be un conditionally received, not as reasonable, nor as unreasonable, but as scriptural.'2 The uncertainty which surrounds Mansel's teachings on the nature of theology makes it difficult to determine precisely whether he should call the theory of regulative truth in theology a theological doctrine or, what 1 On this distinction cf. Mr. Cupitt's remarks on theology and theological statements in Christ and the Hiddenness of God (Philadelphia, 1971), pp. 16, 20. 2 H. L. Mansel, op. cit., p. 127. For his views on the religious knowledge of those who have no access to revealed truth cf. pp. 325-8, and the nature of progress in theology cf. pp. 179-80, 330-2. Mansel's view of theology is over determined by his desire to reject what he calls theological dogmatism: such dogmatism 'seeks to build up a complete scheme of theological doctrine out of the unsystematic materials furnished by Scripture, partly by the more complete development of certain leading ideas; partly by extending the apparent import of the Revelation to ground which it does not avowedly occupy, and attempting by inference and analogy to solve problems which the sacred volume may indeed suggest, but which it does not directly answer; partly by endeavouring to give additional support to the scriptural statements themselves, treating them as truths, not above, but within the grasp of reason and capable of demonstration from rational premises' (pp. 4-5).</page><page sequence="4">456 NOTES AND STUDIES is different, a doctrine which has some bearing on theology.1 What seems likely, however, is that if he regards it as a peculiarly theological doctrine he would claim that it is positively taught in scripture. But there is little if any evidence that he thought it a scriptural doctrine. Here it is important to bear in mind the theory's theological bearings, ft asserts that scriptural claims about God are true for us by virtue of the fact that they provide the appropriate means to think about and worship God even though they may not correspond, for all that we can know by reason, with the divine reality in the way that God's own knowledge of himself corresponds. And that what reason fails to provide faith makes good: for the believer the regulative truths of scripture are not only humanly true but divinely or objectively true. Is this a revealed doctrine ? One can hardly say that it is. There are many biblical texts which speak of the greatness of God and the weakness of man but none which teach that the truth of revealed proposi tions is, from the point of view of reason, to be understood in instrumenta list terms. Indeed, Mansel's comment on 1 Cor. xiii. 9-12 shows that he realizes that this passage, while not inconsistent with his claims, does not proclaim his doctrine. In this scripture, he says, we have 'the Apostle's declaration of the limits of human knowledge'; the passage 'represents God, not as He is in the brightness of His own glory, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; but as He is reflected faintly in broken and fitful rays, glancing back from the restless waters of the human soul.' A page later he says: 'Revelation represents the infinite God under finite symbols, in condescension to the finite capacity of man; indicating at the same time the existence of a further reality beyond the symbol, and bidding us look forward in faith to the promise of a more perfect know ledge hereafter.'2 Scripture certainly contains passages which say that our knowledge of God is imperfect and, perhaps, symbolic, but unlike Mansel's theory of religious truth it does not provide information about the nature of this imperfection nor explain how we should understand the adequacy of authorized religious symbols which conceivably might be true only for man. 1 Compare, e.g., Mansel's statement, quoted below, that the theory is a theological doctrine, which might mean only that it is a doctrine which has an important bearing upon our understanding of theological claims, with his state ment in The Limits of Religious Thought: 'In the philosophy of religion, the true regulative ideas, which are intended to guide our thoughts, are the finite forms under which alone we can think of the infinite God; though these, while we employ them, betray their own speculative insufficiency and the limited character of all human knowledge' (p. 273). 2 Ibid., pp. 20, 21. Both this account of the nature of revelation and his claim that 'Revelation implies an accommodation to the mental constitution of its human receiver' (p. 16) are more problematic than Mansel allows. Cf., however, p. 18.</page><page sequence="5">NOTES AND STUDIES 457 Judged by what seems to be his most important criterion of a theo logical doctrine Mansel should not claim this status for his theory of regulative truth. But does he in fact make this claim ? Does he teach that it is 'about the one thing . . . that theology is allowed to say' ?* Examina tion of his writings strongly suggests that a negative answer should be given to such questions. The textual evidence indicates that his doctrine of regulative truth is a philosophical doctrine which bears upon any discipline, such as philosophy or theology, which deals with matters at and beyond the limits of thought. And, as one would expect of any theory of truth put forward by a philosopher, it rests upon arguments and analyses of a philosophic kind.2 The clearest support for this interpretation is found in The Limits of Religions Religious Thought. In the fifth lecture Mansel argues that the theory of regulative truth applies in philosophy as well as theology. The philoso pher and the theologian alike have to rest content with truths whose truth is to be regarded only as regulative. Examples of such regulative truths in philosophy are the continuity of personal identity through time, the unity in diversity of material objects, and the interaction of mind and body. Such truths or principles, Mansel claims, are essential to our understanding of the world we experience even though they involve mysteries and puzzles which cannot be penetrated or overcome because in order to do so we would have to transcend the limits of thought. 'As mere facts', Mansel writes, 'they are so far from being inconceivable, that they embody the very laws of conception itself, and are experienced at every moment as true: but though we are able, nay, compelled, to con ceive them as facts, we find it impossible to conceive them as ultimate facts'3 Their truth is to be regarded as regulative because they regulate 1 D. Cupitt, 'What was Mansel Trying to Do?', J.T.S. N.s. xxii (1971), P• 545■ 2 Part of the point of Mansel's contrast between regulative and speculative truth clearly depends on his doctrine of the limits of thought: a regulative truth is one which cannot be legitimately used as a basis for speculation about matters outside the limits of thought. Cf., e.g., The Limits of Religious Thought, pp. xiv xv. As well, Mansel's claim that certain religious and philosophic truths should be viewed as rules of thought depends on his account of the psychological conditions of thought. Cf. p. 459 n. 1. Cf. Mr. Cupitt's 'Mansel and Maurice on our Knowledge of God', Theology, lxxiii (1970), pp. 307-9 for a brief but useful account of the wider philosophic background to Mansel's theory of religious truth. 3 Op. cit., p. 99. For Mansel some, if not all, of these regulative truths are statements of the various psychological conditions which govern thought. Cf., e.g., Mansel's Metaphysics (3rd edn., Edinburgh, 1875), pp. 351-3. The reason why they cannot be considered as ultimate facts is that on Mansel's view we can entertain the possibility that they might not govern our thinking even though we cannot think this possibility. There must, he claims, be some explanation why our consciousness is regulated by these conditions. 2298 0 74 H h</page><page sequence="6">458 NOTES AND STUDIES all our truth-seeking activities and prevent fruitful speculation about that which lies beyond them. Thus it is that 'the highest principles of thought and action, to which we can attain, are regulative, not speculative•.—they do not serve to satisfy the reason, but to guide the conduct: they do not tell us what things are in themselves, but how we must conduct ourselves in relation to them.'1 The claim that there are regulative truths in philosophy receives its most detailed and developed statement in the various editions of the Bampton Lectures. It is tempting, perhaps, to think that Mansel intro duces the doctrine here simply to further the apologetic task of pointing to parallel features and difficulties in theology and philosophy. Such a view, however, is mistaken. The doctrine stated in The Limits of Religious Thought Thought is consistent with his teaching in other places about the nature of philosophic knowledge and is foreshadowed in some of his earlier writ ings. Indeed the parallels between his claims about philosophic and theological knowledge are quite striking. For Mansel the work of the philosopher and all thinkers is necessarily governed by the logical and psychological conditions of consciousness. The aim of legitimate philosophy, he says, is 'not to transcend conscious ness, but to make consciousness at unity with itself'.2 What Mansel takes this to involve is shown in detail in Prolegomena Logica (1851) and Meta physics physics (1857). The philosopher, he argues, ought first to describe and analyse the different types of general conditions of consciousness and then consider the ontological questions which arise in considering the source and nature of such basic ideas as substance, person, cause, appear ance, reality, which we use in ordering and understanding the phenomena of consciousness. 'Of these two inquiries,' he writes in Metaphysics, 'the first is preliminary and auxiliary to the second; both because it is neces sary to know what the facts of consciousness are in themselves, before inquiring into their ulterior relations, and because the light which the former inquiry is calculated to throw on the laws and limits of thought will be of importance in determining how far it is possible to attain to a satisfactory answer to the latter.'3 In achieving his first goal the philosopher provides the determining conditions of all thought, 'the laws and limits of Reason'.4 Of these laws and limits, those which state the necessary psychological conditions of thought can be regarded as statements of the rules which 'positive' or 1 Ibid., p. loo. 2 'On the Philosophy of Kant', Letters, Lectures, and Reviews, p. 182. 3 Metaphysics, pp. 30-1.

The psychological limits of thought stand to all thought, including theological reason, in the same way as the facts of revelation stand to theology: successful or genuine thought, 'positive thought', is possible only in accordance with the laws and limits of thought, and successful theological reasoning, or 'positive thinking' in religious matters, can be achieved only by working within the strict boundaries set by revelation. Since the psychological conditions of thought regulate the material form of thought and the scriptural revelation regulates the content of genuine theological thought, it is not surprising that Mansel should have come to apply the epithet 'regulative' both to the truths stating the psychological limits of thought and those about God derived from revelation. Both sets of truths provide rules which, he believes, we all should follow.2 There is, moreover, a second striking parallel between Mansel's ac count of philosophic and theological knowledge. In his discussion of both types of knowledge Mansel has recourse to faith to overcome the problem that what we have to regard as true might be objectively false or false in the sight of God. His use of faith to rescue the regulative truths of revelation from sceptical criticism has already been noted in my earlier article. What has not been observed, however, is that the same appeal to 1 For Mansel the psychological conditions of consciousness and thus of thought provide the limits of reason but they differ from the logical limits of thought or laws of reason in two ways: first, some at least of the psychological conditions do not apply to every object of thought whereas the logical laws of reason govern whatever we think (cf. Prolegomena Logica, pp. 86—7); secondly, the logical limits of reason cannot be thought or supposed not to hold whereas the limits imposed by the psychological conditions of consciousness can be judged not to hold though not thought not to hold (ibid., p. 162). It is not absolutely clear whether Mansel regards the two general forms of consciousness —every object of consciousness must be capable of being distinguished and capable of entering into a relation—as providing a logical or psychological limit upon thought. Cf. The Limits of Religious Thought, n. ix, p. 243; Metaphysics, pp. 58-9. In 'The Limits of Thought and Regulative Truths', jf.T.S. N.s. xxi (1970), p. 372, I failed to notice this uncertainty. The psychological conditions of thought, unlike the laws of logic, can be properly described as rules or instruments of thought because they might have been different and, he sometimes allows, we are free to observe them since it is possible though not wise to think 'negatively' about situations which are beyond the range of our experience. Both these points depend on Mansel's and Hamilton's doctrine that the province of judge ment extends beyond that of thought. Hamilton's views are expounded in H. L. Mansel, The Philosophy of the Conditioned (London and New York, 1866), pp. 36-7, 51-7, 123 ff. On rules and principles of thought cf. D. Mitchell, An Introduction Introduction to Logic (London, 1962), pp. 57-9, 153. 2 It might be objected that the difference between the way in which the truths of philosophy and revelation regulate is of such an order that it ought to be marked by a difference in name, but the point seems over-precise.</page><page sequence="8">460 NOTES AND STUDIES faith is used to blunt the strict instrumentalism of his claims about philosophic knowledge. There are several places where Mansel makes use of faith to overcome the problem of scepticism. The most explicit is in Prolegomena Logica, ch. 3, 'On Law, As Related to Thought and Other Objects'. Here he raises the question whether human knowledge, knowledge formed in accordance with the laws and limits of thought, properly merits the title of knowledge. Are the truths discovered statements of what is the case in the eyes of other intelligent beings or are they merely human truths, truths relative to our state and situation? The question, Mansel argues, cannot be answered by philosophy, since in order to determine whether the conditions of human consciousness are 'instruments of deception' we would have to be able to compare them with the conditions which govern other types of consciousness and this we cannot do. 'If man as a thinker is subject to necessary laws,' Mansel writes, 'he cannot examine the absolute validity of the laws themselves, except by assuming the whole question at issue. For such examination must itself be conducted in subordination to the same conditions.'1 Philosophy, therefore, cannot rule out the threat of scepticism. The knowledge whose forms it in vestigates, and of which it is a part, might, for all it can show, be system atic error or confusion in the sight of God and his angels. Yet, Mansel argues, the failure of philosophy ought not to lead to despair, for the judgements and convictions of faith are not restricted by the limits of philosophy. Within the circle of faith it can be known that the conditions of human consciousness are the divinely chosen means to enable men to discover objective truth in ways appropriate to their nature rather than an arbitrarily imposed set of rules. A good God, Mansel argues, would not leave his intellectual creatures bereft of the ability to participate in some way in his knowledge of the truth. The orthodox theist should trust the God in whom he believes and regard the general conditions which govern the experience and thought of human beings as rules divinely appointed to enable men to discover and know in some unspecifiable way what is objectively the case. We may indeed believe, and ought to believe, that the powers which our Creator has bestowed upon us are not given as the instruments of decep tion. We may believe, and ought to believe, that intellectually no less than morally, the present life is a state of discipline and preparation for another; and that the portion of knowledge which our limited faculties are permit ted to attain to here may indeed, in the eyes of a higher Intelligence, be but partial truth, but cannot be absolute falsehood. But in believing thus, we desert the evidence of Reason to rest on that of Faith, and of the principles Prolegomena Logica, pp. 72-3.</page><page sequence="9">NOTES AND STUDIES 461 on which Reason itself depends it is obviously impossible to have any other guarantee. But such a faith, however well founded, has but a regulative and practical, not a speculative application. It bids us rest content within the limits which have been assigned to us: it cannot enable us to overleap them, or to exalt to a more absolute character the conclusions obtained by finite thinkers concerning finite objects of thought.1 It is, of course, one thing to claim that faith can enable the philosopher to accept the limits of thought as the divinely appointed rules governing our discovery of truth in this life, and another to say that the statements of these rules are regulative and not speculative truths. But the difference between the two claims is not very great. Since truths are often named after the character of the facts that they state, there can be no objection to his describing the correct statements of the psychological conditions of thought as regulative truths. And since faith alone justifies the claim that these rules of thought are the means by which our knowledge of objective truth is obtained, such regulative truths cannot be rationally regarded as providing a basis for speculation about matters beyond human experience. Both points are nicely illustrated in Mansel's account of the philosophic principle that mind and body interact with one another, a principle which he later describes as a regulative truth: 'For purposes of scientific investi gation, the principle is thus purely negative [i.e., it refers to matters which cannot be thought], though it serves to regulate our belief. We know not to this day, and we never can know in this life, how mind operates upon matter; though we must believe that, in some way or other, it does so operate.'2 The doctrine of regulative truth in its bearings on philosophy is clearly foreshadowed in Prolegomena Logica but it does not appear in a fully fledged form until the Bampton Lectures, though its importance for theology had been stressed in 'Man's Conception of Eternity' (1854).3 1 Ibid., pp. 73-4. Cf. also pp. 76-7. For other uses of faith to overcome the threat of scepticism, cf. 'On the Philosophy of Kant', p. 183, 'Philosophy and Theology', pp. 340-8, 359-60, Letters, Lectures, and Reviews. In the latter article Mansel also provides non-theological grounds for the attitude of faith. 2 Prolegomena Logica, p. 151. 3 In this article Mansel draws a sharp contrast between religious and specula tive thought. Many religious issues are practically urgent whereas most, if not all, of the issues of speculative philosophy have no significance for practice (Letters,(Letters, Lectures, and Reviews, pp. 112-13). He then points out that since we cannot frame speculatively adequate concepts of the divine nature we must rest content with anthropomorphic concepts of God and regulative truths. Mansel's remarks might be interpreted to mean that in religion unlike philosophy there are regulative truths given by God in order to satisfy man's religious needs. It must be noted, however, that the philosophic questions Mansel considers in this article are issues of speculative philosophy such as, e.g., the possibility and</page><page sequence="10">462 NOTES AND STUDIES In The Limits of Religious Thought, however, Mansel explicitly teaches that the philosophic principles which state the rules which govern thought are to be understood as regulative truths. The context in which he introduces this point is determined in part by his desire to rehabilitate the claims of religious thought after his destructive analysis of the errors to which it is prone. To achieve this end he argues, in imitation of Butler's method, that religion is no more poorly placed in relation to the limits of thought than its commonly regarded rival, philosophy. One of the analogies that holds between them is that the highest information either can offer is no more than regulatively true. 'It is thus strictly in analogy with the method of God's Providence in the constitution of man's mental faculties, if we believe that, in Religion also, He has given us truths which are designed to be regulative, rather than speculative; intended, not to satisfy our reason, but to guide our practice; not to tell us what God is in His absolute nature, but how He wills that we should think of Him in our present finite state.'1 The reason why this analogy holds is found 'in the constitution of man's mental faculties'. It is because 'the limits of religious thought are but a special manifestation of the limits of thought in general'2 that we can expect to find common general features in both philosophy and theology, for both disciplines study matters which exceed the limits of thought. Mansel's doctrine of the truth provided by philo sophy and theology is one such common feature. And it is a doctrine which is largely dependent upon his theory of the nature and limits of thought, a theory which precludes any study of the Absolute or absolutes. 'The distinction between speculative and regulative truths, which has also been a good deal misapprehended,' Mansel writes, 'is one which follows inevitably from the abandonment of the philosophy of the Abso lute. If human thought cannot be traced up to an absolutely first principle of all knowledge and all existence; if our highest attainable truths bear the marks of subordination to something higher and unattainable; it follows, if we are to act or believe at all, that our practice and belief must be based on principles which do not satisfy all the requirements of speculative reason. But it should be remembered that this distinction is not peculiar to the evidences of religion. It is shewn that in all departments of human knowledge alike—in the laws of thought, in the movement of our limbs, in the perception of our senses—the truths which guide our practice nature of other forms of consciousness besides human consciousness. On such matters he nowhere teaches that there are any claims which should be regarded as regulative truths. It would be a mistake to put too much weight on this article as a guide to his views about regulative truths in philosophy. 1 The Limits of Religious Thought, p. loi. 2 Ibid., p. 18. Cf. also pp. xlvii-xlviii, 19, 48-9, 118, 336. This point is fundamental to an understanding of Mansel's account of theological knowledge.</page><page sequence="11">NOTES AND STUDIES 463 cannot be reduced to principles which satisfy our reason; and that, if religious thought is placed under the same restrictions, this is but in strict analogy to the general conditions to which God has subjected man in his search after truth.'1 Once we reject the view that the doctrine of regulative truth is for Mansel a strictly theological theory, there is no problem in claiming, as the textual evidence requires, that the doctrine is a philosophical theory of application to any discipline working at what Mansel takes to be the boundaries of experience. Nor can there be any objection to the claim that the correctness of the theory is to be assessed by reference to the philosophic arguments and doctrines which support it. There remains, however, one further question about this interpretation, viz. Mr. Cupitt's point that Mansel derived his doctrine from his theo logical tradition.2 The force of this point depends upon the way in which 'derive' is understood. In one sense of the word, a fairly weak sense, there is no difficulty involved in accepting this claim. It is clear from Mansel's own admissions that his views about the nature and limits of theological knowledge were influenced in various ways by the writings of Browne, King, Copleston, Whately, Hampden, and others. It is also certain that he drew a great deal of encouragement from the fact that general claims similar to his had a long and noble history in theological thought. 'I have so far a respect for Catholic antiquity,' he writes in reply to Goldwin Smith, 'that I should consider the fact of a theological doctrine having appeared for the first time in the eighteenth century [in the writings of Browne and King], as a strong presumption against its truth.'3 Yet, as Smith pointed out, identity of doctrine is not guaranteed by identity in the general statement of the claim that the doctrine is designed to explain and justify,4 and Mansel had to concede something to 1 The Limits of Religious Thought (3rd edn., London, 1859), pp. xxii-xxiii. Note also his claim that 'Action, and not knowledge, is man's destiny and duty in this life; and his highest principles, both in philosophy and in religion, have reference to this end' (5th edn., p. 105). 2 On this tradition cf. D. Cupitt, 'The Doctrine of Analogy in the Age of Locke',Locke', J.T.S. N.s. xix (1968), and The Hiddenness of God, chs. 4, 5. 3 H. L. Mansel, A Second Letter to Professor Goldwin Smith (Oxford, 1862), pp. 40-1. 4 Goldwin Smith, Rational Religion, and the Rationalistic Objections of the BamptonBampton Lectures for 1858 (Oxford, 1861), p. 24: 'When the general standard of authority has been fixed, there comes the question whether the particular authority alleged in each case is actually in point. To pronounce in the affirma tive, we must be assured that the writer had before him the exact question at present in issue, which, from the restless flow of thought, is seldom the case; and we must be assured of the precise meaning of his words, which, if disputed, can be settled only by a general induction from his works. We ought also to know the historical circumstances under which he wrote, that we may be able to estimate</page><page sequence="12">464 NOTES AND STUDIES the criticism. He replies that his quotations from the Fathers and others on the limits of theological knowledge are designed to show that 'in sub stance at least, [his claims] are not new'. The passages, he says, are not to be regarded 'as indicating more than a substantial correspondence with my own view, or as all expressed in language in which I should entirely concur'.1 There is no doubt that Mansel wishes to say with all the orthodox that 'now we see through a glass, darkly', but his doctrine is the way in which he interprets, supports, and applies this claim. Whether his doctrine is identical with that of one or more other thinkers or is a natural develop ment of the doctrine of some predecessor is to be discovered by reference to the reasons which support the claim and govern its interpretation and application.2 There could, of course, be a large number of degrees of resemblance between doctrines. But it seems highly unlikely that, in any strong sense of the word, Mansel derived his doctrine of regulative truth from any of his predecessors, even Peter Browne, for the theory is firmly embedded in a philosophy based upon the neo-Kantian doctrines of Sir William Hamilton.3 The Limits of Religious Thought is, Mansel says, a critique of theological reason, but it follows more closely the example and doctrines of Hamilton rather than those of Kant. 'It is rather to a philo sopher of our own age and country', he writes in the first edition, 'that the effects of these circumstances on his mind and to make allowance for the bias which they may have given to his thoughts.' Cf. also pp. 24—9, 75, 112. 1 H. L. Mansel, op. cit., p. 15. 2 Mansel provides a good example of this point in dealing with Maurice's criticism of his use of the term Kantian in connection with the distinction be tween noumena and phenomena: 'He [Maurice] first assails his opponent for speaking of the "well known language of the Kantian philosophy", with reference to the distinction between phenomena and things in themselves; and he obligingly informs his readers that the distinction in question has existed in philosophy "for at least two thousand years". Does Mr. Maurice then suppose that a distinction can never occupy a peculiar position in a certain philosophy, unless it is one which had never been heard of before? Cannot the language of Kant, in this respect, differ from that of his predecessors, unless he invented the terms in which the difference is expressed ?' (An Examination of the Rev. F. D. Maurice's Strictures Strictures on the Bampton Lectures of 1858 [London, 1859], pp. 58-9). 3 Mansel says that the distinction between regulative and speculative know ledge 'holds an important place, under a slightly different nomenclature, in the philosophy of Kant' (The Limits of Religious Thought, p. 272). Cf. also A Second Letter Letter to Professor Goldwin Smith, pp. 47-8. He claims as well that he came to prepare the Bampton Lectures after a study of Browne and King and Berkeley's criticism of their positions (A Letter to Professor Goldwin Smith [Oxford, 1861], p. 9), though most of the doctrines maintained in the Lectures, including the doctrine of regulative truth, are to be found in his earlier writings. Hamilton seems not to have stated a theory of regulative truth but Mansel's doctrine is little more than an extension of certain of Hamilton's views; cf. The Philosophy of the Conditioned, pp. 40-6, 67-70.</page><page sequence="13">NOTES AND STUDIES 465 we must look for the true theory of the limits of human thought, as applicable to theological, no less than to metaphysical researches,—a theory exhibited indeed in a fragmentary and incomplete form, but con taining the germ of nearly all that is requisite for a full exposition of the system.'1 In the development of this philosophy of learned ignorance, Mansel believes, the ancient claims about the divine incomprehensibility and the partial character of our knowledge of God receive a more ade quate grounding than that provided by any of his predecessors.2 And if, as I have argued, Mansel's hopes are not fulfilled this does not show that the historic teaching is false but only that Mansel has failed. But this in itself is worth while showing because Mansel's account of the divine incomprehensibility usefully illustrates some of the problems in the way of a negative theology and some of the mistakes which should be avoided.

On the same page Mansel points out that while Hamilton's writings contain 'the best theoretical exposition of the limits of thought', Butler's work provides 'the best instance of the acknowledgement of those limits in practice'. Undoubtedly Mansel wishes to imitate Butler's practice but the means he chooses are largely borrowed from Hamilton. As a disciple, Hamilton, not Butler, is his master. The fact is well illustrated in his explanation, in reply to Maurice, of his statement about Hamilton and Butler in the preface to his Lectures: 'It simply asserts that the inquiries which Butler's practical sagacity led him to decline, as beyond the limits of man's faculties, are precisely those which require for their solution that very Philosophy of the Unconditioned which Hamilton's theory declares to be unattainable. A considerable portion of the Bampton Lectures is occupied with an attempt to submit some of these problems to the test of Hamilton's principles' (An Examination of the Rev. F.F. D. Maurice's Strictures on the Bampton Lectures of 1858, pp. 25-6). 2 Cf. his remarks about the relationship between Hamilton's thought and theology in The Philosophy of the Conditioned, pp. 43 ff.</page></plain_text>
