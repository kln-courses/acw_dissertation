<plain_text><page sequence="1">Politics &amp; The Invention of Reason Timothy V. Kaufman-Osborn Whitman College This essay draws loosely upon John Dewey's published and unpublish- ed works to locate the origins of philosophy's inversion of the on- tological relationship between prereflective experience and the thinking it occasionally elicits. Arguing that reason owes its birth to a formaliz- ed reification of the know-how embodied in the skills and products of antiquity's crafts, the author suggests that contemporary political theory is ill advised to turn to classical philosophy to defend the cause of democratic politics. Indeed, he sees the task of contemporary democratic politics as being not to rehabilitate the classical tradition but to overcome it, and he concludes by sketching a political reason that moves in this direction. Timothy Kaufman-Osborn is Associate Professor of Political Science at Whitman College. He has published previously in Political Theory, Journal of Politics, American Journal of Political Science, and elsewhere. What is gained by rooting the critique of contemporary politics in a return to the polis? Wonderful in its plasticity, the city-state has assumed many forms and accommodated many purposes during the second half of this century. For Leo Strauss and Eric Voegelin, its privileged access to the truth of human order discloses the impoverishment of a civiliza- tion whose relativism leaves it internally incoherent and externally defenseless.' For Hannah Arendt and (more ambiguously) Sheldon Wolin, its celebration of debate among equals on a public stage recalls the forgetfulness of an era which no longer knows how to distinguish be- 1.

All think it possible to recover certain dimensions of the ancient city-state's significance without at the same time carrying forward others that undermine or violate the contemporary purpose of that appropriation. Strauss, for example, presupposes that we can disconnect classical philosophy's quest for "that political order which is best always and everywhere"' from the cosmology that rendered this search a meaningful enterprise; Arendt holds that we can dissociate the Greek concept of the political from its relationship to a cultnre that required the wholesale exclusion of those who inhabit but do not fully belong within the most inclusive form of human association; MacIntyre contends that we can abstract the Greek understanding of practical wisdom and so render contingent its dependence upon the integrity of premodern forms of collective identity; and so forth and so on. To challenge this shared presupposition, I will argue that when philosophy's origins are subjected to "intellectual disrobing,"' the tradi- 2.

Rather, it is an interpretation of the origins of philosophy whose general thrust, but neither its detail nor its conclusions, is suggested by his published and unpublished writings. I employ Dewey's words when I find them especially apt; but I do no more than necessary, given scholarly convention, to distinguish those words from my own.

That tradition's birth merits special scrutiny because "the statement of any event or historical series in terms of its earlier members" presents "matter(s) in so simpli- fied a form that we can detach and grasp separately elements which are wholly lost in the confused complexity of the mature phases. ... Starting with the earlier ones as our clue, we can trace each successive degree of complication as it introduces itself. . . . We put together the separate threads coming from different sources and see how they are woven into a pattern so extensive and minute as to defy the analysis of direct inspec- tion."6 By exploring the sources of certain of the basic understandings that mark off the terrain upon which modern discourse proceeds, we may prove able to loosen the grip of certitudes whose immediacy other- wise blocks our apprehension of their power. Detecting the twisted remains of ancient categories within a world that no longer shares antiquity's assurance of nature's teleological order, we may come to experience our present intellectual habit(ation)s with dis-ease and so question their adequacy to inform the sense of contemporary experience. But what hermeneutic principle is best suited to inform an account of the relationship between reason and the prephilosophical experience out of which it was initially fashioned? Neither an idealist narrative, which neglects the cultural background out of which philosophy first emerged, nor a materialist account, which affirms a unilinear causal relationship between substratum and ideological epiphenomena, will do. For "reason" has a history which is neither distinct from, nor intelligible apart from, the rise and fall of specific forms of cultural life. More pointedly, because "the distinctive office, problems, and subject-matter of philosophy grow out of stresses and strains in ... common life," its constructions are best construed as second-order theorizations whose "analytic dismemberment and synthetic reconstruction"' of the larger meaning-laden context out of which they grew gives intellectualized voice Anderson, "Dewey's Experiment With Greek Philosophy," International Philosophical Quarterly, 7 (1967): 86-100; John Anton, "John Dewey and Ancient Philosophies," Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, 25 (1965): 477-99; and Walter Veazie, "John Dewey and the Revival of Greek Philosophy," University of Colorado Studies in Philosophy, 2 (1961): 1-10. 6.

As clues to forms of collective association that may be consolidated or undermined when philosophy's refined meanings are reappropriated by their context, its texts always point beyond themselves. As such, they are to be "traced back to their origin in primary experience, in all its heterogeneity and fullness, so that the needs and problems out of which they arise and which they have to satisfy are acknowledged.. . . It is no longer enough for a principle to be elevated, noble, universal and hallowed by time. It must present its birth certificate, it must show under just what conditions of human experience it was generated, and it must justify itself by its works, present and potential."" I. The stability of archaic Greece's quasi-feudal order presupposed undeviating fidelity to a body of customary understandings whose ratification of the layered rights and duties of the semi-autonomous oikos legitimated the domination of its warrior aristocracy over the silent demos. This mythopoetic code endowed that culture's coincidence of class and political stratification with divine significance; for the un- challengable relations of dependence sustained between master and serf found their cosmic reduplication in the monarchia of Zeus, as well as the complex hierarchy of powers his rule upheld. Transmitted across genera- tional lines via the poetry of Homer and given its most systematic expres- sion in Hesiod's Theogony, this web of communal conviction insured that individual particularities were swallowed up within the comprehen- sive imperatives of unity. This order began to unravel when its received resources of intelligibil- ity proved insufficient to fashion unproblematic sense from the shifting parameters of collective experience. Here I need not do full justice to the why and how of this erosion. For my purposes, it is enough to note two interconnected developments. First, the seventh and eighth centuries B.C. witnessed settlement of the loosely confederated Ionian colonies along the coast of the Aegean Sea as well as the correlative resumption of maritime trade with the East. Unimpeded by the bureaucratized institu- tions that had guaranteed ecclesiastical dominion in Egypt and Mesopotamia, the protoscientific speculations of Asia Minor fell on fer- tile soil in the Hellenic world. Second, acceleration of artisanal ac- complishment within the colonies challenged the earlier view, implicit 8.

Kaufman-Osborn 683 within Hesiod's account of the woes imposed on mankind as punishment for Prometheus's theft of fire, that the struggle to exert significant con- trol over the material circumstances of collective existence was ultimately futile in virtue of the radical dependence of human projects on the in- tervention, whether for ill or good, of an omnipotent Zeus. "The out- standing characteristic of Greek culture in the period under considera- tion . . . was the growth of the arts to the point of self-consciousness, that is, to the point wherein they demanded and received reflective atten- tion. The arts of medicine, drama, navigation, artisanship, gymnastics, war, speech-making, political control and administration were gradually liberated from subjection to routine ancestral custom."9 Embedded in the flexible and discriminating habits of skilled crafts- men, these arts secured nature's cooperation by fashioning mutable resources in the service of concrete need. Although "sensation and perception" supplied both the native materials and the original occasion for their fashionings, such "fund(s) of insights useful in conducting the affairs of life" did not give rise to experience (in the sense suggested by the term "empeiria") until "retention was added and . . . a common factor in the multitude of felt and perceived cases detached itself so as to become available in judgment and exertion.. . . Here experience means the preservation, through memory, of the net result of a multiplicity of particular doings and sufferings; a preservation that affords positive skill in maintaining further practice, and promise of success in new emergen- cies.'''" When sufficiently articulated, that memory took shape as loosely integrated clusters of prosaic generalizations about how to respond to the shifting demands of everyday experience, whether these be encountered in the process of building a house, making a statue, leading an army, or whatever. Such knowledge, although fully contained and expressed within the habit-laden practice of specific agents, had "nothing merely personal or subjective about it; it was a consolidation, effected by nature, of particular natural occurrences into actualization of the forms of such things as are thus and so usually, now and then, upon the whole, but not necessarily and always."" Consummating possibilities intimated but only partly realized within nature's emergents, these consolidations secured the useful and, at the same time, satisfied the desire of the senses to fashion coherent wholes from their in-formed materials.

Knowing fate to be the vehicle through which the gods might at any moment sus- pend, disrupt, or reverse the familiar natural cycles in which humans had placed their unreflective trust, that sense was governed by its presenti- ment of the arbitrary, the terrible, and the inexplicable: "There are two urns that stand on the door-sill of Zeus," Homer reminds his audience in the Iliad (xxiv.525). "They are unlike for the gifts they bestow: an urn of evils, an urn of blessings. If Zeus who delights in thunder mingles these and bestows them on man, he shifts, and moves now in evil, again in good fortune." Nevertheless, each new expression of Prometheus's primal crime could not help but chip away at forms of collective con- sciousness that knew no distinction between the profane and the magical. Indicating acknowledgment of sequential bonds linking nature's recur- rent events, the deployment of tools and other equipmentalities signified that what had once been accepted in its qualitative immediacy was now construed in terms of relational structures joining experience and nature via their reciprocal doing and suffering. "As long as men are content to enjoy and suffer fire when it happens, fire is just an objective entity which is what it is. That it may be taken as a deity to be adored or pro- pitiated is evidence that its 'whatness' is all there is to it. But when men come to the point of making fire, fire is not an essence, but a mode of natural phenomenon, an order of change, a 'how' of a historic sequence.... Acumen, shrewdness, inventiveness, accumulation and transmission of information are products of the necessity under which man labors to turn away from absorption in direct having and enjoying, so as to consider things in their active connections as means and as signs. " I The disruptive possibilities implicit within this interruption of experi- ence's qualitative immediacy were first grasped, albeit fragmentarily, when the Ionian physiologoi began to use analogies culled from the ac- tivities of the cook, the farmer, the potter, and the smith to render the events of the cosmos intelligible without recourse to anthropomorphic or animistic agencies. "The(se) early philosophies were stories of nature. As Homer told the story of the Trojan war and the wanderings of Odysseus, 12. John Dewey, Art as Experience (New York: Paragon, 1979), p. 50. 13. Dewey, Experience and Nature, pp. 235, 122.</page><page sequence="7">Timothy V. Kaufman-Osborn 685 so Thales and others recounted the epic of nature, relating its movements to the elements that formed its dramatis personae."' Considered com- prehensively, the plots of these early narratives are best grasped by con- sidering how each appropriated and reconfigured the metaphorical con- tent suggested by either of two overlapping but distinct fields of technical practice. "Among the arts the sharpest contrast, both as to their own procedure and to their social setting, was between the agrarian and the mechanical. The former had to do with living, growing things, the latter with making objects by means of reshaping of materials;" and it is the complex history of these central metaphorical clusters which, as we shall see, furnishes the key to "the whole philosophical tradition."" When thinking about the cosmic drama located its inspiration in analogical extrapolation of meanings wrought from agrarian experience, the most salient categories used to explain the segregation of specific realms of being out of a primordial state of undifferentiated unity took their cue from the activity of generation. So informed, as was uni- formly the case with Milesian speculation, the material root underly- ing all change was rendered as a seminal agency endowed with the capa- city for self-movement qua reproduction and growth, as when Anax- imander explained the formation of the world through reference to a germ, or gonimon, capable of begetting heat and cold. The process of change was said to be ruled by the seasonal or rhythmic alteration of qualitatively opposed active and passive principles such as male and female, hot and cold, wet and dry; and the termini of change were discovered within mature consummations of such patterned transforma- tions. Declining to draw an unambiguous distinction between the vital and the non-living, an originally inchoate reality was thus apportioned through the ordering of things into kinds according to their organic derivation from the cosmos' primal seeds. "The net conclusion is that Nature is possessed of life, self-movement, self-governance and teleological operation - that is, direction of change toward a fixed and predestined end."'16 By way of contrast, when nature was read through analogical ex- trapolation of meanings fashioned from newer forms of mechanical 14.

Whereas the first tale thought of "natural processes as themselves bent upon the fruit which gives meaning and value to them," the second regarded "natural elements as indifferent and even recal- citrant, needing to be bent by human intervention to use and enjoyment." Thus, its recitation looked "like a prescription or recipe which tells a physician or cook, or metal worker, how much of each stuff to select and how to compound it with suitable quantities of other stuffs."9" How these epics of nature attest to the archaic world's decay is best il- lustrated by the speculations of Anaximander and Heraclitus. However unwittingly, Anaximander challenges divine prerogative, as well as its ex- pression in omens, oracles, and marvels, when he draws his account of the sun's motion from observation of a familiar technical achievement, in this case the chariot wheel, and its elaboration as an explanatory generalization capable of extension to a multiplicity of phenomena.1" By the same token, Heraclitus undermines the representation of change as evidence of divine intervention when, after examining the conduct of taut bow strings, he concludes that the appearance of rest in nature con- ceals an orderly cycle of transformation between dynamic powers turn- ing in concurrent opposition to one another. "Cold things grow hot, hot things grow cold, the wet dries, the parched is moistened.. . . The latter [of each pair of opposites] having changed becomes the former, and this again having changed becomes the latter" (Frgs. 126, 88). 17. Ibid. 18. See Aetius 2.20.1: "Anaximander says the sun is a circle twenty-eight times the size of the earth, like a chariot wheel, with its felloe hollow and full of fire, and showing the fire at a certain point through an aperture as though through the nozzle of a bellows."

Kaufman-Osborn 687 These imaginative extrapolations could not eliminate entirely the ter- ror of a human situation beyond its own command. But, by locating its most fateful powers within a macrocosm whose motions heed deter- minate principles applicable to all things, including the microcosmic agency who mimics this comprehensive whole, they imply that intelligible regularities check and constrain the appearance of the unanticipated. Thus Anaximander argues that the triumph of the earth's stability over the motions of the cosmos is explained not by the arche (rule) of an exter- nal cause governing its motions, but rather by the situation of this well- rounded, free-floating, and motionless sphere, "like a stone column" (Frg. 5), at the center of an order whose harmony is a function of the dynamic equilibrium sustained by recurrent association amongst its reciprocal constituents. Because that order is invested with the directive capacities hitherto ascribed to the gods, it is capable of self-regulation and so no longer needs divine rule to insure its dike (justice). No longer is Zeus, as Aeschylus claims in his Suppliant Maidens, the "lord of lords, most blessed among the blessed, power most perfect among the perfect" (524-526), and no longer is his dynasteia (mastery) over all things the condition of their unity. Indeed, in an important sense, his rule is incom- patible with the claims of justice. For the rectitude of the affairs of the cosmos can be guaranteed only so long as the original equality of its op- posing powers is maintained, i.e., only so long as no single power dominates the others."9 Hence, when injustice occurs, as it does on Anax- imander's account of the seasons' alternation, compensation is exacted via a commensurate subjection dictated not by the gods, but by the drive of the cosmos to sustain its tense balance of powers: "For they pay penalty and retribution to each other for their injustice according to the assessment of time" (Frg. 1). In sum, the very possibility of thinking the thought of "nature" presupposes subversion of the strict segregation between a higher and a lower grade of being, whether cast as divine and mortal, or master and servant. Be that as it may, the physiologoi's departure from the mytho-poetic construction of the cosmos, as well as its authorization of corresponding earthly hierarchies, should not be exaggerated. Although their cosmologies are not explicitly linked to acknowledged public cults, the ancient divinities persist, albeit in sublimated form. Unwilling to aban- 19. For another statement regarding the equality of the basic components comprising the cosmos, see Parmenides: "But since all things are named Light and Night, and names have been given to each class of things according to the power of one or the other (Light or Night), everything is full equally of Light and invisible Night, as both are equal, because to neither of them belongs any share (of the other)" (Frg. 9).</page><page sequence="10">688 Politics &amp; the Invention of Reason don wholly the assurance of past cosmic order, the Ionians seek to recon- cile the ethical rules and ideals embodied in the traditional code with technai's more prosaic knowledge by extracting from the mass of de- tailed legends, myths, and traditional tales an all-encompassing, singular principle of divine being. Thus Anaximander subsumes his explanatory insights beneath the ungenerated, imperishable, and homogeneous Apeiron (Boundless Stuff), whose abstracted articulation of the hylozoistic substance identified by Thales supplies metaphysical comfort to those unsettled by disintegration of the customs that hitherto had assured the meaningfulness of human existence. Similarly, revealing the unease called forth by his own contention that "this ordered universe was not created by any one of the gods or of mankind," Heraclitus recasts the arche of Zeus as the depersonalized and immanent rule of a divine Logos whose power "steers all things through all things:" "If we speak with intelligence, we must base our strength on that which is com- mon to all, as the city on the Law and even more strongly. For all human laws are nourished by one, which is divine" (Frgs. 30, 41, 114). In each of these cases, the hint of a cosmos whose immanent destiny is left unspecified by divine pleasure is glimpsed; but that hint goes unfulfilled in the quest to reinstate the reassuring subjection of human experience to fate by conceiving of causality as a primary and monistic substance whose unchanging presence guarantees the surpassing unity and identity of that which is. "Water, air, fire, number and measure are different modes of naming the divine principle that encompasses and runs through all things, and so rules their changes."20 II. When these corrosive narratives of nature were transported from Asia Minor to the Greek mainland where the transition from an agrarian economy grounded in the oikos to a craft and trade based economy centered in the polis was already well advanced, myth's unreflective assurance that mere existence is the measure of its rightness became ever more problematic. No longer certain that "language is the natural and appropriate vestment in which things and thought inevitably clothe themselves," the Sophists came to suspect that "every story or account of nature is a story or account, and as such, is subject to the conditions imposed by being an account."21 Making explicit the Ionians' unspoken 20.

Kaufman-Osborn 689 disjunction between physis and nomos, the Sophists express the specula- tion, welcome to some and deeply unsettling to others, that human order is not the work of an enchanted nature whose divine compass embraces all genuine goods, but rather something manufactured like a pot or a house. To Antiphon, this suggests that "the edicts of the laws are impos- ed artificially, but those of nature are compulsory. And the edicts of the laws are arrived at by consent, not by natural growth, whereas those of nature are not a matter of consent" (Frg. 44). To Protagoras, secure in his conviction that "about the gods I am not able to know whether they exist or do not exist, nor what they are like in form" (Frg. 4), this same premise signifies that what a given collectivity regards as right and good is, within its confines, right and good. The dispute between Antiphon and Protagoras proves possible and in- telligible only because its audience now finds problematic the archaic sense of experience's pragmata.22 Recall that the archaic age was defined by its strict hierarchical congruence between the exercise of economic privilege, the power of rule, and the rites through which this cor- respondence was grounded in the divine. For example, the righting of 22. Derived from the verb "to do" (prassein), the singular "pragma" is one of the most common words in the vocabulary of ancient Greece. Furnishing the root for a complex ar- ray of compound verbs and nouns, its range of meaning covers much more ground than I need specify in this context. However, as the concrete of its cognate "praxis, " one of its most basic senses refers to a specific act or deed. Thus, in his "Against Aristogeiton" (1.57), Demosthenes explains that the target of this accusation sought to sell Zobia, his mistress, into slavery after she "did the act of a woman" (gunaiou pragm' epoiei). Here, "pragma" is appropriately used in the context of a circumscribed situation about which there is some to-do. The distinctive quality of that situation, as well as others like it, is sug- gested by the idiom "pragma esti moi. " Best translated as "it concerns me," this phrase conveys the adverbial sense that there is "something the matter," i.e., something unsettled, within a present state of affairs that summons the attentive response of those concretely im- plicated in its eventual issue. This sense is retained in the opening scene of Aristophanes' Lysistrata. There, the comedy's protagonist seeks to persuade her sisters to join her intrigue by insisting that "tes poleos ta pragmata, " which Liddell and Scott render as "the fortunes of the state," are now "anchored on us women" (32). While off the mark as a literal translation, the term "fortunes" is quite apt inasmuch as it captures the common associa- tion between the plural "pragmata" and the contingencies of human affairs. Never wholly responsive to the impress of purposive design, these uncertain matters, whose meaning can be assuredly known only after they have done their work, are always subject to unan- ticipated twists of fate, and so pregnant with the possibility of suffering and sadness. That is clearly Thucydides' implication in offering his-account of the "pragmata, " i.e., the "cir- cumstances" (1.89), that explain Athens' emergence as an imperial power, and so set the stage for the tragedy whose larger meaning he explores; and it is this same sense that Socrates draws upon when, in the closing remarks of the Apology (41d), he insists that it is better for him "to die now and be freed from" his "troubles" (apellachthai pragmaton).</page><page sequence="12">690 Politics &amp; the Invention of Reason wrong, as when Odysseus slays Penelope's suitors, was an exclusive prerogative of an aristocratic nobility whose special connection with matters of sacred import legitimated its monopolistic jurisdiction over questions of justice. Within these confines, the emergence of affairs taken to be common because they mutually implicate ruler and ruled is severely circumscribed by the special status of those who, replicating the role of Zeus, are the condition and source of order's possibility. That hegemony is challenged when Solon decrees that homicide is not a restricted matter to be settled between one gene (clan) and another in light of the claims of a divinely ordained ethos, but rather a common af- fair in which all, regardless of official status, have a shared stake.23 By giving everyone title to intervene on behalf of anyone who has suffered an injury, he questions whether celestial signs are sufficient to resolve issues of justice and so invites public appropriation of prerogatives previously restricted to the few. Re-weaving the web of everyday cir- cumstance, Solon opens up a space within which matters of general con- cern and consequence, i.e., of qualitatively inclusive pragmata, can emerge from those more delimited in significance. Several decades later, that work comes to fruition when Cleisthenes, completing the transfor- mation of Homer's assembly of the invisible demos into a deliberative body of the demes, implicitly acknowledges that continued disclosure of politika pragmata depends upon (re)generating the institutionalized media of power that sustain their appearance in the unbounded field wrought by an-archic collective association. Ironically, the most revealing expression of the relationship between such collective empowerment and the emergence of distinctively political affairs appears in Plato's Protagoras, where Protagoras retells the myth of Prometheus.24 Protagoras explains how Prometheus provided for the necessities of human existence by stealing from Hephaestus and Athena "the gift of skill in the arts." But, he continues, this acquisition left human beings unable to live in peace with one another; "for they had not the art of politics." "Zeus therefore, fearing the total destruction of our 23.

This specifically politike techne, Zeus further ordered, was not to be distributed as were the other technai, i.e., in accordance with the necessities of specialized labor. Countering Plato's claim that "no large group of men is capable of acquiring any art, be it what you will,"25 Protagoras insists that it is precisely because the capacity for excellence in all other arts is unevenly distributed that "everyone must share in this kind of virtue; otherwise the state [the form of association whose end is to cultivate politika pragmata] could not ex- ist." Making explicit the political import of Empedocles's insistence that the elements comprising the cosmos "are equal and of the same age in their creation, but each presides over its own office, and each has its own character, and they prevail in turn in the course of Time" (Frg. 17), Pro- tagoras acknowledges that isonomia, equal engagement in the generation and exercise of power, is a necessary condition of the reality of peculiarly political phenomena. The fragility of the Protagorean project becomes apparent when the Sophists' navigation of nature's tales toward more worldly contexts pro- duces the enigmatic figure of Socrates; for his story contains within it the fleeting promise of a reason that is "in no danger of being caught in its own machinery""26 as well as the germ of its own miscarriage. Practicing a dialectic whose profession of its own ignorance does not extinguish its ability to criticize that which is, Socrates' questioning reveals the transformation of knowledge into a common cultural possession which, because open to a plurality of interpretations, unveils the issue of truth. From one perspective, his life work signifies final decomposition of the deferential ethos that for so long frustrated the transmutation of ar- chaicism's unperceived inequalities into the fifth century's class- conscious conflicts between urban democratic and aristocratic-oligarchic factions.27 From another perspective, though, his work points toward rehabilitation of that same ethos.

Intimating that the virtues of a declining aristocracy might be cast not as attributes immanent within certain classes of action, but as transcendent ideals to which all conduct is related as approximation rather than as instance, Socrates foreshadows the paradoxical possibilities of a reason that owes its existence to techne's devitalization of mythological doctrine and yet embraces as its purpose the re- fortification of a decaying order's customary beliefs. Poised between the enclosed mysteries of the wisdom cults and the exposed controversies of the agora, the ambiguity of Socrates is soon to be resolved in favor of a form of knowledge that takes its charge to be the articulation of a "method of thought and knowledge which while purifying tradition should preserve its moral and social values unimpaired; nay, by purifying them, add to their power and authority. To put it in a word, that which had rested upon custom was to be restored, resting no longer upon the habits of the past, but upon the very metaphysics of Being. . . . Out of this situation emerged the entire tradition regarding the function and office of philosophy which till very recently has controlled the systematic and constructive philosophies of the western world."28 III. "Greek philosophy converted not psychological conditions but positive institutional affairs into cosmic realities."29 The substantive ends of classical reason represent the transmutation of techne's unsystematized and flexible skills into decontextualized and rigidified conceptual truths given in the nature of abstract things.30 Its formal features, surpassing the particularity of myth's heroic ethic while reasserting the universality of its authority to regulate everyday affairs, offer rhetorical displays whose magnification of the signs of rigorous demonstration induce its audience to submit to truths they can no longer uncritically endorse. The distinction between Plato and Aristotle turns on how each transforms the common stock of materials inherited from his 28. Dewey, Reconstruction in Philosophy, pp. 17-18. 29.

Because Lloyd is in- sensitive to the political context of classical Greece, he can only find "remarkable" (p. 293) the conjunction of, on the one hand, philosophy's contempt for craftsmen and, on the other, its use of metaphors drawn from techne to describe the order of the cosmos.</page><page sequence="15">Timothy V. Kaufman-Osborn 693 predecessors within an order that now embraces the polis rather than the oikos as the principal unit of collective life, and so defines its most com- prehensive relationships in terms of citizenship rather than kinship. Plato's synthesis of earlier philosophies of nature with the logico/ethical ideas he derived from Socrates resolves the tension between the mechanical and agrarian epics of nature by elevating his teacher's dialogic into a metaphysic, and then construing the latter as a cosmology whose geometrically patterned order is imbued with living spirit by the skillful practice of a demiurge. At first, and conforming to Socrates' ac- count of ethical form as that ingredient shared by all instances of a specified class of actions, Plato understands the intelligibility of a thing as its immanent organization when seen as an embodied whole. Before long, though, he takes "the structure of discourse for the structure of things, instead of for the forms which things assume under the pressure and opportunity of social cooperation," and so converts the haphazard "results of the observations and procedures of farmers, navigators, and builders" into an architectonic "pattern of logical and metaphysical subordination of change to directly possessed and enjoyed fulfillments.""'3 Thus does Plato resituate techne's ability to achieve form within a divine realm where its realization no longer requires material embodiment to prove either real or intelligible. Arguing that the cosmos's fund of realized, objective, and impersonal designs furnishes the ideal standards that make possible judgment upon its necessarily imperfect approximations, Plato defends the rule of crafts' practice by rigidified caricatures of its own achievements. "When arts follow fixed models, whether in making shoes, houses, or dramas, and when the element of individual invention is condemned as caprice," the product of fabrication is considered real only to the extent that it bears the impress of form whose existence precedes "any particular realization.'"32 Moreover, as Plato insists in the Gorgias, because techne makes no "pretense whatever to reason and practically no effort to classify" (501a), its skill can generate no knowledge of the ends to which its fruits are to be put. As such, the bearers of that skill comprise a class that must be kept in order by laws imposed from above, since otherwise its intrinsically limitless action cannot help but destroy harmony in the name of liberty. Finding incredible Anaximander's contention that order is the fruit of a tense equilibrium sustained between dynamic parts, no one of which exercises permanent superiority over the others (Laws 889b-890c), Plato resurrects archaicism's assurance that only absolute 31.

The achieve- ment of unity, accordingly, must be the work of those who mimic craft's concrete accomplishment by rpturning a hypostatized rendering of its teleological practice to the arena of politics and thereby subjecting its ar- bitrary custom to the impositions of a totalizing rationality. Recasting the virtues of a declining nobility as the specialized proficiencies of those skilled in the sovereign art, Plato offers the personification of techne's alienated intelligence, "above labor and entanglement in change and practice," as the exclusive intermediary through which those bereft of logos may secure access, however partial, to a transcendent realm afford- ing "the only sure guaranty of truth about empirical matters, and the sole rational guide to proper social institutions and individual behavior."" Representing the purified polis as the aristocratic oikos writ large, Plato presents the latter's hierarchy as an antidote to an Athens in which decomposition of that same household has disclosed a realm of distinctively political affairs. Because Plato's thought, in tension with itself, metaphorically privileges the work of a class that "coerces" nature by subjecting it to an "artificial" yoke, its representation of philosophy's absolute and supreme reality can yield no more than an uncongenial heresy. Its power dwindles when challenged by a rival whose resolution of the physic/nomos dichotomy more persuasively promises to restore the harmony that was lost when myth's assurances were undermined and when the city, once the model of order and decorum, became a scene of factional strife and insecurity. Aristotle's agrarian-based teleology is best read as a synthetic conjunction of Plato's Forms, understood as the ultimate goal of all true insight, with the material elements drawn from pre-Socratic philosophy. However, because Aristotle regards matter as indeterminate stuff not yet organized into specific form, he is able to argue that realization in an organic body of the forms found in things constitutes mind as the end of nature; and this in turn enables him to overcome Plato's difficulties in explaining the union of form and matter without falling prey to the errors of earlier materialist doctrines which, with the exception of the Pythagorean, were unable to account for the qualitative differentiation of natural phenomena out of a homogeneous universal root. 33.

Kaufman-Osborn 695 Diffusing techne's concrete capacities throughout a demythologized nature, Aristotle ascribes its powers to the spiritualized nisus of a mind which, although endowed with the animating force needed to arouse movement from potentiality to actuality, is emancipated from the degradation of intercourse with matter. Then, impious towards the prac- tice that gives form and substance to his own theoretical constructs, he invests nature's consummatory ends with an intrinsic worth he denies to craft's actual creations. "With no suspicion that he was thereby subject- ing his metaphysics to an anthropomorphic rendering of nature," Aristotle "reads nature in terms of politics in order to . . . read politics in the light of supposed sanctions of nature."34' Furnishing reflective ex- pression to the disjunction between the authority of a master who utters orders and the efficacy of a servant who executes them, his doctrine of the four causes recapitulates the fixed relations of rule that obtain when the labor of one class is justified through reference to the necessity of another's disembodied leisure; "one that can foresee with his mind," Aristotle argues, "is naturally ruler and naturally master, and one that can do these things with his body is subject and naturally a slave."3' This formulation, in turn, insures the dis-appearance of peculiarly political experience. For its very possibility presupposes a web of common in- volvements that can emerge only among human beings who are no longer convinced, quoting Aristotle, that "in every composite thing, where a plurality of parts . . . is combined to make a single common whole, there is always found a ruling and a subject factor."''36 Politika pragmata can neither arise nor flourish when cosmic and earthly hierarchies, reciprocally reified through assimilation of each to the other, are jointly constituted as closed aristocracies consisting of a limited number of qualitatively distinct and eternal classes whose mutual exclusivity is the sine qua non of order's conservation. Consequently, Aristotle is guilty of bad faith when, in the opening book of his Metaphysics, he insists that it was purely speculative "curiosity that first led men to philosophize and that still leads them."3" 34.

Denying that the "first thinker who proclaimed that every event is effect of something and cause of something else... merely put into words the procedure of the workman, converting a mode of practice into a formula,""9 Aristotle cannot acknowledge that nature appears as a system of ends only because human beings first acted as fabricators. If he is to sustain his contention that a teleological meta- physics is "the most appropriate kind" of knowledge "for God to have,"40 Aristotle must hide reason's ultimate origins in the unarticu- lated knowhow of those who reshape the offerings of nature-in-experi- ence. "This lack of piety concealed from [Plato and Aristotle alike] the poetic and religious character of their own constructions, and established in the classic Western philosophic tradition the notions that immediate grasp and incorporation of objects is knowledge; that things are placed in graded reality in accordance with their capacity to afford a cultivated mind such a grasp or beholding; and that the order of reality in Being is coincident with a predetermined rank of Ends."''41 Diverting thinking away from the concerns of common life and toward more noble contro- versies about the conditions, organs, and "objects" of knowing, that tradition's disjunctions between truth and falsity, knowledge and opinion, reality and appearance, depend in the last analysis upon forms of practice whose worth these dualisms deny; and, in this way, domina- tion is situated at the core of a discursive order whose abstracted reifica- tion of narratives' metaphors rule the powerless through the medium of a vocabulary they once spoke but never "knew." At a still deeper level, the significance of classical reason's expropria- tion concerns its inability to re-locate the experiential ground from which it grows ever more detached. Remember that "the Greeks were induced to philosophize by the increasing failure of their traditional customs and beliefs to regulate life. Thus they were led to criticize custom adversely 38.

Kaufman-Osborn 697 and to look for some other source of authority in life and belief. Since they desired a rational standard for the latter, and had identified with experience the customs which had proved unsatisfactory supports, . . . the struggle of reason for its legitimate supremacy could be won only by showing the inherently unstable and inadequate nature of experience."42 More precisely, as a manifestation of those realms of being that are infected by chance and change, empeiria is defined by three disabilities. "There is the contrast of empirical knowledge (strictly speaking, of belief and opinion rather than knowledge) with science. There is the restricted and dependent nature of practice," as exemplified in its use of tools and materials, "in contrast with the free character of rational thought. And there is the metaphysical basis for these two defects of experience: the fact that sense and bodily action are confined to the realm of phenomena while reason in its inherent nature is akin to ultimate reality."43 Hence Plato in the Timaeus: If mind and true opinion are two distinct classes, then I say that there certainly are these self-existent ideas unperceived by sense, and apprehended only by mind; if, however, as some say, true opinion differs in no respect from mind, then everything that we perceive through the body is to be regarded as most real and cer- tain. But we must affirm them to be distinct, for they have a distinct origin and are of a different nature; the one is implanted in us by instruction, the other by persuasion; the one is always accom- panied by true reason, the other is without reason; the one cannot be overcome by persuasion, but the other can; and lastly, every man may be said to share in true opinion, but mind is the attribute of the gods and of very few men. Wherefore we must also acknowledge that one kind of being is the form which is always the same, uncreated and indestructible, never receiving anything into itself from without, nor itself going out to any other, but invisible and imperceptible by any sense, and of which the contemplation is granted to intelligence only. And there is another nature of the same name with it, and like to it, perceived by sense, created, always in motion, becoming in place and again vanishing out of place, which is apprehended by opinion jointly with sense (51d-52a). 42.

Dissolving experience's particularistic en- tities within its pure objects, that reason presupposes that its refined noetic constructs exhaust the true meaning of things and so renders the concrete fabric of matter-of-fact experience immaterial, unproblematic, and in time invisible. "Since thinkers claim to be concerned with knowl- edge of existence, rather than with imagination, they have to make good the pretention to knowledge. Hence they transmute the imaginative per- ception of the stably good object into a definition and description of true reality in contrast with lower and specious existence, which being pre- carious and incomplete, alone involves us in the necessity of choice and active struggle. Thus they remove from actual existence the very traits which generate philosophic reflection and which give point and bearing to its conclusions. What is left over, (and since trouble, struggle, con- flict, and error still empirically exist, something is left over) being excluded by definition from full reality is assigned to a grade or order of being which is asserted to be metaphysically inferior. Then the problem of metaphysics alters: it becomes an endeavor to adjust or reconcile to each other two separate realms of being.""44 So detached from the finite web of affairs, which are of consequence because they are of concern, classical philosophy cannot help but violate the things emerging within experience; its legitimate authority requires that the qualitative dimen- sionality of experienced pragmata be grasped exclusively through the self-sufficient" concepts generated by its misinformed ontology. "The resulting theory of substances, essential properties, accidental qualities and relations, and the identification of Being, (by means of the copula is) with the tenses of the verb, (so that the highest Being was, is now, and ever shall be, in contrast to existence now and then, occasional, wholly past, merely just now, or possibly at some passing time in the future) controlled the whole scheme of physics and metaphysics, which formed the philosophic tradition of Europe."45 That tradition's identification of Becoming with indeterminate nega- tion and of Being with the fully real, which confirms its privileging of the knower/known relationship over the doer/sufferer relationship, is characteristically expressed as a claim on behalf of reason's nonmediated in-sight into the world's truth; and this representation of cognition as a 44.

Kaufman-Osborn 699 kind of vision into essence is itself made possible by philosophy's seman- tic transformation of the terms nous and physis. With Homer, the verbal form of nous (noein), designates a distinctive way of being within an un- familiar situation.46 Presupposing no dissociation between an intellectual organ and its function, this verb characteristically denotes either the act of appreciating the genuine significance of a circumscribed and singular situation, as when Helen suddenly grasps that her visitor is not an old wool-dresser, as she first appeared, but rather Aphrodite in disguise (Il- iad, iii.396ff.); or, alternatively, the act of crafting a course of action that responds to a situation's import for the present's movement into the future, as when Nestor urges the Achaians to consider how undoing the wrong done to Achilles by Agamemnon might restore the former's pro- wess to their cause (Iliad, ix.102ff.). As such, noein may be said to refer to a kind of perception; but, should we accept that designation, we must not forget that "to perceive is to acknowledge unattained possibilities; it is to refer the present to consequences, apparition to issue, and thereby to behave in deference to the connections of events. As an attitude, perception or awareness is predictive expectancy, wariness."47 The possibility of overcoming the particularism of this usage was first disclosed, as we have seen, by advances in the sphere of technai; "the first groping steps in defining spatial and temporal qualities, in trans- forming purely immediate qualities of local things into generic relation- ships were taken through the arts. The finger, the foot, the unity of walk- ing were used to measure space; measurements of weight originated in the arts of commercial exchange and manufacture.""48 These steps were consolidated when the lonians, in their appropriation of technai's analogies, marginalized the role of the embodied senses so as to insist that only the peculiarly intellectual sense of nous, which "is infinite and self-ruling and is mixed with nothing, but is alone itself by itself" (Anax- agoras, Frg. 12), can penetrate beyond the world as most take it to be.'49 46. For the following remarks, I am indebted to Kurt von Fritz, "Noos and Noein in the Homeric Poems," Classical Philology 38 (1943): 79-93; "Nous, Noein and their Derivatives in Pre-Socratic Philosophy (Excluding Anaxagoras), Part I," Classical Philology 40 (1945): 223-42; and "Nous, Noein and their Derivatives in Pre-Socratic Philosophy (Excluding Anaxagoras), Part II," Classical Philology 41 (1946): 12-34.

For he is not equipped with a human head on his</page><page sequence="22">700 Politics &amp; the Invention of Reason Plato, finally, revealed the logical terminus of this evolution when he ef- fected the disembodied reification of theoria's truth, manifest in the ac- tivity of one who is expert at "being an onlooker," as an autonomous epistemic reality available to but a few: "When he [the philosopher] had reached the stage of trying to look at the living creatures outside the Cave, then at the stars, and lastly at the Sun himself, he arrived at the highest object in the visible world. So here, the summit of the intelligible world is reached in philosophic discussion by one who aspires, through the discourse of reason unaided by any of the senses, to make his way in every case to the essential reality" (Republic 532a). This construction of truth from the viewpoint of a disconnected center of reason is paralleled by the constitution of knowing's knowns as self- contained entities whose physis is left untouched by that vision.50 Prior to its philosophical misconstruction, the familiarity of any ordinary thing, i.e., acknowledgement of its participation within a meaningful situation, was rooted in an anticipatory sense of how that thing typically inter-acts with others appearing within the shifting contexts of everyday circumstances; the "nature" of a "thing" was taken as a clue to what it most often does, as when Homer used the term physis to refer to the ap- pearance of a plant whose present import stems from its capacity to yield magical effects (Odyssey x.303). This reference to anticipated conse- quences begins to fall away, however, as the physiologoi come to picture knowing as a relationship between an object torn from its situatedness in everyday affairs and a solitary knower. Infusing that relationship with special power to reveal an object's governing principle, Heraclitus hails the capacity of nous to distinguish "each thing according to its physis [i.e., its not immediately visible structure] and so point out how it really is" (Frg. 1). This abstraction from the qualitative culminates, again, in Plato for whom "things and events as they show themselves" in ex- perience are "merely 'shows'; and they exhibit their showiness to the thoughtful mind by their transitoriness and their seductiveness.. . . In short, things are appearances, shadows, seemings, imitations and body, nor from his back do two branches start; (he has) no feet, no swift knees, no hairy genital organs; but he is Mind, holy and ineffable, and only Mind, which darts through the whole universe with its swift thoughts" (Frgs. 133, 134). 50. See John Dewey, The Quest for Certainty (New York: Paragon, 1979), p. 23: "The theory of knowing is modeled after what was supposed to take place in the act of vision. The object refracts light to the eye and is seen; it makes a difference to the eye and to the person having an optical apparatus, but none to the thing seen. The real object is the object so fixed in its regal aloofness that it is a king to any beholding mind that may gaze upon it. A spectator theory of knowledge is the inevitable outcome."</page><page sequence="23">Timothy V. Kaufman-Osborn 701 misrepresentations, falsifications of what they purport faithfully to represent. They are, to use the Greek word for these functions, phenomena.""5 Supposing that the activity of apprehension is simple and singular, classical reason concludes that the essence of the object ap- prehended must be as well. To grasp the explicitly political import of this impoverishment of ex- perience's contents, it is important to see that theoria's characterization of its unconditioned entities turns upon a synthetic assimilation of, on the one hand, its hypostatized rendition of crafts' purposive produc- tions; and, on the other, a sublimated recapitulation of myth's convic- tion that the persistence of order depends on the continuous presence of a supreme source of power. When philosophy transforms technai's fruits into the unambiguous and indubitable ends of its cognition, and then ascribes to those ends the authoritative imperatives once ascribed to Zeus, the result is a teleocratic view of knowledge whose realization demands the rule of concrete experience by reason's determinate reifica- tions. Certain that all particulars are real only to the degree they par- ticipate in eternally self-identical forms, reason's relationship to experi- enced pragmata, like myth's monarchia, must assume the character of monologic and unilinear command. To remain assured of its own truth, in other words, philosophy must assimilate and/or subjugate anything that does not fit the terms specified by its incorruptible, sovereign, and "artificial simplification of existence;" being's approximation to reality, and hence its susceptibility to rational examination, demands that it "be reduced and transformed till it is defined in terms identical with the characteristics presented by refined objects of science as such.""52 The despotism of the purely conceived over the contextually lived is given its most obvious institutional exemplification within the class struc- ture of Plato's Republic. It might appear, by way of contrast, that Aristotle rejects his mentor's subsumption of all being beneath the categories of knowledge when he contends that the soul is the perfected entelechy of the body, and hence that experience offers a kind of cognitive ladder by means of which forms may be gradually elicited from their apparent submergence in matter. However, certain that the cosmos it has analogically constructed is the product of reason's original vision, Aristotelian knowing also culminates in immediate apprehension of ab- stracted form invisible to sense; and so each embodied and contingent particular, to which nous can have no direct access, proves intelligible 51.

Moreover, when he insists that all entities either move or are moved toward determinate ends given prior to that movement itself,'" Aristotle completes transformation of the Milesians' understanding of arche, i.e., the principle whose dynamic rule brings about and limits change, into the abstraction of substance, i.e., the self-causing end whose ruling presence informs all change and so unambiguously determines things to be what they are and not something else.54 Plato's radical transcendentalism thus spawns its logical counterpart, i.e., apolitical resignation before a world which, frustrated by the presence of an obdurate matter that refuses to yield itself wholly to form, already manifests its full complement of Be- ing. IV. How shall we now read those contemporary political theorists who locate their inspiration in the polis? Taking one from each of the three pairs cited at the beginning of this article, first consider Leo Strauss. While we may appreciate the brilliance of his exegetical skills, we need not take too seriously his effort to overcome the crisis of the West by resuscitating the ancient city-state's transhistorical wisdom about the "nature of political things."" If it is true that philosophy's original ac- complishments constitute so many attempts to answer with equal authority but in alternative form the questions to which myth responded prior to its devitalization, then perhaps our interest in reason is best served if these questions are simply laid aside. No longer convinced that knowledge is derived from a higher source than is practical activity, and no longer sure why politics requires extra-political warrant to insure its authority, we may acknowledge the fundamental incompatibility between foundationalist proclivities arid denjocratic sensibilities. The former, exemplified in Strauss's rehabilitation of natural law, derives from the desire to transcend the vicissitudes of precarious becoming by placing certain cherished convictions beyond debate; the latter, eager to endorse Heraclitus's contention that the individual occurs within the strife sustained by tensely counterposed opposites, regards the will to ex- 53.

To escape experience's sting by privileging the necessary, universal, and fixed over the changing and contingent is to condemn reason to ceaseless vacillation between, on the one hand, the quest to measure up to standards it ought to abandon and, on the other, the search for consolation when those standards go unmet. It is only when we tire of compensating for our disappointments, by fashioning truths out of "the objects of ordinary experience with their blemishes removed, their imperfections eliminated, their lacks rounded out, their suggestions and hints fulfilled," that we shall become able to ask why our accustomed ways of ordering collective existence inspire so many failures to recover the r-assurances once furnished by custom as well as why we appear unable to entertain the hypothesis that "common ex- perience is capable of developing from within itself methods which will secure direction for itself."'6 Second, recalling that the possibility of the city-state required the superimposition of its superficial layer of cultured citizens upon a dense mass of artisans and laborers, we must find suspect Hannah Arendt's contention that the "general crisis that has overtaken the modern world"" is rooted in reversal of the hierarchical order once sustained among the essential dimensions of the human condition. With Arendt, we may grant that philosophy is born out of a desire to "find a remedy for the frailty of human affairs""5 through discovery of truths whose im- position upon practice promises an escape from the perils of politics. However, recognizing that the emergence of democratic politics within Athens depended on the empowerment of nondependent laborers which, in turn, made possible a dissociation of economic and civic status, we must call into question her uncritical embrace of philosophy's im- poverished and dissimulating representation of techne. The tale told here suggests that Arendt's triadic conception of the vita activa (labor, work, and action) bears significant traces of the aristocratic ethos that informs antiquity's invention of the vita contemplativa.

Concluding that the chief threat to democratic politics is the inversion of public and private realms rather than the persistence of institutional structures that consolidate the domination of body's mind, practice's theory, and democracy's aristocracy, Arendt reconfigures as a division between de-contextualized forms of experience the disjunction between means and ends that Aristotelian philosophy fashioned from the city-state's isolation of the superior from the inferior. Finally, we must question Hans-Georg Gadamer's contention that if we are to overcome the contemporary crisis we must first "enlighten the modern attitude of making, producing, and constructing about the necessary conditions to which it is subject.""59 Echoing Plato, Gadamer urges us to recall techne's inability to generate the standards that govern use of its products, and so its need to be subordinated to the authority of a qualitatively different kind of knowledge. The problematic character of this appeal to phronesis, which is prima facie suspect because it takes for granted antiquity's hierarchy of cognitional forms, becomes ap- parent when Gadamer argues that the correctness of moral and political reasoning is to be specified in terms of its adequacy to the telos at which it aims. Should Gadamer, on the one hand, take this to mean, as Aristo- tle suggests in his Rhetoric, that such reasoning simply discerns the most useful means to a given end,60 then he must forego the critical advantage he hopes to derive from the idea of phronesis. Should he, on the other 59. Hans-Georg Gadamer, Truth and Method, tr. Garrett Barden and John Cumming (New York: Crossroad, 1975), p. xxv. See also Gadamer's essay "Notes on Planning for the Future," Daedalus 95 (1966), where he argues that "it is the essence of techne that it does not exist for its own sake or for the perfectibility of the object, as though the latter ex- isted for its own sake. What pertains to the nature and appearance of the perfectible object is wholly dependent on the use for which it is intended. But regarding the utility of the ob- ject, neither the knowledge nor the skill of the craftsman is the master. The faculties of the craftsman do not guarantee that the object will be used according to its requirements or, more decisively, that it will be used for something which is right" (pp. 577-78). 60.

Kaufman-Osborn 705 hand, embrace the broader sense of deliberation offered in Book 6 of the Ethics, i.e., that of deliberation upon the ends of a good life,61 then he must acknowledge the untenability of the metaphysical foundations that sustained Aristotle's view as well as the lack of any contemporary con- sensus about what counts as such a life. In either case, Gadamer's argu- ment, whose intelligibility presupposes the existence of solidaristic and traditional communities that do not exist at present and that could only be reconstituted through authoritarian measures, recapitulates the class- based premises of ancient philosophy in its anachronistic affirmation of the liberal over the vocational arts. V. Our experience of the present is thoroughly "saturated with the products of the reflection of past generations and by-gone ages. It is filled with in- terpretations, classifications, due to sophisticated thought, which have become incorporated into what seems to be fresh, naive empirical material. If we may for the moment call these materials prejudices (even if they are true, as long as their source and authority is unknown), then philosophy is a critique of prejudices."62 That critique, whose aim is to explore the architectonic structure within which the furniture of our minds is so often arranged and rearranged without altering its overall shape, undermines the present's legitimacy by offering a critical recovery of and from the past. Contra Strauss, however, that project does not claim "to understand the thinkers of the past exactly as they understood themselves."63 With the passage of time, the past's possible mean- ingfulness becomes both greater and richer due to its involvement in ever more complex networks of events whose content enters vitally into the constitution of the present. As the present becomes past and the future present, there emerge qualitatively distinct epistemic relationships be- tween that which has passed away and our current situation; and so the polis cannot help but alter its character as a possible object of thinking. "Dis-membering is a positively necessary part of re-membering. But the 61. See Aristotle, Nichomachean Ethics, tr. Terence Irwin (Indianapolis: Hackett, 1985), 1142b28-33: "Further our deliberation may be unconditionally good or good only to the extent that it promotes some [limited] end. Hence unconditionally good deliberation is the sort that correctly promotes the unconditional end [i.e., the highest good], while the [limited] sort is the sort that correctly promotes some [limited] end." 62.

The purpose of this tale, conse- quently, is to fashion a narrative that discloses to us our complicity in an unfolding drama whose meaning gives point to our daily practice but whose plot we only partly comprehend. Its value is measured by its capacity to quicken in us a sense of how our accustomed meanings shape our experience in some ways but not in others, as well as its ability to designate a path whereby we might bring into existence ways of being in- timated but not realized within the tradition that tale refashions. What character might experience assume if we were to try to think ourselves into a less antidemocratic future by reconfiguring a tradition which inflicts its monologic spectatorial ideals upon the concrete, the contingent, and the complex? To challenge the West's hyperrationalistic conviction that knowledge is concerned with revelation of antecedently real existences, and that the properties of value discovered therein pro- vide determinate standards for the regulation of conduct, is not to dig beneath the core of classical reason so as to secure access to a plane of pure experience, whatever that might mean; our reflection on the how of what we experience may be resculpted, but it will never penetrate to some essence of its pragmata. Nor is it to urge that we simply invert the polarities that give shape to that core by, for example, elevating practice above theory and so rendering articulate presently marginalized and/or trivialized forms of activity; for that is to remain trapped within its governing confines. Rather, it is to suggest that if we work our way back to the spatiotemporal forms of meaningful experience from which reason was originally wrought, we may find ourselves in a position to ask how rationality might be regrounded in its contextualized moorings and thereby deterred from equating its abstracted parts with the whole from which it is derived; and this, in turn, may lead us to re-collect the qualitative dimensions of the distinctive form of emergent experience that Socrates, in the Apology, designates using the phrase "ta politika pragmata" (31d). Given that virtually "every word that we can use . . . is infected by the associations of old theories, whose import is opposite to that here 64.

Kaufman-Osborn 707 stated," one can only hope to "insensibly produce . . . a change in the significations"65 that now occlude such experience. Be that as it may, if our desire is to achieve a more nuanced immersion in political matters, we might begin by heeding Empedocles who cautions that we ought not to "hold any (percept of) sight higher in credibility than (those) accord- ing to hearing, nor (set) the loud-sounding hearing above the evidence of the tongue (taste); nor refuse credence at all to any of the other limbs where there exists a path for perception, but use whatever way of percep- tion makes each thing clear" (Frg. 3).66 To sustain its distance from and authority over empeiria, classical philosophy must deny that nous'access to physis is itself grounded in the actions of a moving body substantially involved in a world known through the media of other senses. Yet the achievement of any perspective, including that hypostatized as classical contemplation, can emerge only because sight is already situated by dynamic kinesthetic activities that generate the dimensional coordinates through which the eye's envisionings are integrated into a sense of ob- jects' corporeality and location. "We do not believe a thing to be 'there' because we are directly cognizant of an external origin for our percep- tion; we infer some external stimulation of our sensory apparatus because we are successfully engaged in motor response. Only when the latter fails, do we turn back and examine the matter of sensory stimula- tion."67 Pace Aristotle's contention that reason possesses no bodily organ, sight is but a single function of an organic agency whose know- ings turn upon the interrelated engagement of many ways of grasping the world's pragmata. When knowing, appropriately embodied, is re-located within ex- perience, the link between politics and the verb poiein (doing some-thing) re-appears. The definitive segregation of episteme (theoretical science) from techne such that the latter was denied all association with the arts of poiesis and the former came to be considered sole heir of mind's nobler pursuits was not finally consummated until Aristotle concluded that "the sciences which are cherished on their own account and in the interest of knowledge are closer to wisdom than those desired on account of their 65.

Corliss Lamont (New York: Horizon, 1959), p. 95: "I think this whole problem of understanding should be approached not from the point of view of the eyes, but from the point of view of the hands. It's what we grasp that matters." 67. Dewey, Experience and Nature, p. 335. For a helpful discussion of the priority of touch over sight, see Hans Jonas, "The Nobility of Sight: A Study in the Phenomenology of the Senses," in his The Phenomenon of Life (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1966), pp. 135-56.</page><page sequence="30">708 Politics &amp; the Invention of Reason by-products."68 To reconstruct the thinking that culminates in this asser- tion is to re-call earlier usage which, unaware of Aristotle's division of all entities into those produced by their own kind and those produced by another species of being,'69 situated techniculture's fruits within a com- plex of meanings that drew no unambiguous ontological distinction be- tween nature and art. It is, in other words, to see that the Platonic/Aristotelian syntheses of mechanical and agrarian metaphors are optional, and hence that it is possible to fashion hybrids that for- mulate anew the terms of reason, and so of reason's politics as well. If we were to re-member physis and nous, understood as overlapping manifestations of that larger life-giving dynamic through which ex- perience's mutable offerings are shaped to form in time,70 and if to that recollection we were to join the vernacular recognition that "experience is primarily a process of undergoing, a process of standing something, of suffering and passion, of affection, in the literal sense of these words,""' we might find ourselves guided toward forms of thinking whose integrity does not demand subsumption of the textures of everyday life, richly organized for practical ends and laden with complex traditions, beneath teleocracy's determinate ends. So oriented, we might acknowledge that to know politika pragmata, i.e., to re-cover those affairs that citizens dis- cover to be of mutual concern, is to actualize existences that reside as emergents within experience but are not yet shaped to common sense by critical explorations of their unborn potentialities. The truth of that sense, grounded not in a logical principle but rather in the supportive soil of everyday being, is an unfolding fruit which, depending on its fertility, fares well or ill when planted alongside other truths at varying moments in their respective histories. Democratic politics, emerging from within this tangle, may thus become the subject of a tendance that gathers 68. Aristotle, Metaphysics 982a15.

For its more restricted use in reference to production aiming at an end outside itself, see Ethics 1140b6. 69. See Aristotle, Metaphysics 1070a6-9: "We note that all primary beings (both those generated naturally and otherwise) come into being out of something with the same name. Things come into being by art or by nature, or else by fortune or by chance. When they are generated by art, their source is in something else; when by nature, their source is internal to them (thus, it is man that generates man); and when they become by fortune, they do so by privation of art; and when by chance, by privation of a natural factor." 70.

Kaufman-Osborn 709 together its animating capacities, as impediments to a fuller flowering of its powers are winnowed from familiar ways of fashioning experience's affairs. Any such effort to refashion our accustomed meanings will prove defi- cient at some points and unsuccessful at others. Still, reconstruction of the sort hinted at here is inseparable from the struggle to show how we might overcome the irony of a tradition that affirms the ultimacy of reason, yet denies the ground out of which it first emerged in order to stay its unsettling possibilities. "The more it is asserted that thought and understanding are 'ends in themselves,' the more imperative is it that thought should discover why they are realized only in a small and ex- clusive class. The ulterior problem of thought is to make thought prevail in experience, not just the results of thought by imposing them upon others, but the active process of thinking. The ultimate contradiction of the classic and genteel tradition is that while it made thought universal and necessary and the culminating good of nature, it was content to leave its distribution among men a thing of accident, dependent upon birth, economic, and civil status."72 Thus the moral of this tale of reason's generation becomes apparent: the possibility of democracy's politics re- quires un-learning a present whose truth, feeding off the authority asserted by a hypostatized vision of knowledge, hinders recovery of "that which in the name of religion, of philosophy, of art and of moral- ity, has been embezzled from the common store and appropriated to sec- tarian and class use."73 72.
