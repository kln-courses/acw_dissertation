<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME LIGHTS ON THE BRITISH IDEALISTIC MOVE- MENT IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY. By R. M. WENLEY, Ann Arbor, Mich. IN a review of the late Dr. John Caird's Fundamental Ideas of Christianity, contributed to a former issue of this JOURNAL (April, I900), a promise was made to consider at greater length the move- ment represented chiefly by this author and by his brother, Dr. Edward Caird, his associate for twenty-eight years on the staff of the University of Glasgow. At the outset, I recognize fully the tendency of the pupil to idealize masters who swayed him dur- ing his most plastic period, and to exaggerate their influence, in so far, at all events, as concerns its extension beyond the circle of those with whom they came into intimate contact. But forewarned is forearmed; and accordingly, by way of reinfor- cing my own judgment, I cite two unprejudiced witnesses. In a leading article, printed the week after John Caird's death, the London Spectator, a paper little given to undue enthusiasm and critical in its attitude toward the Scoto-Oxonian idealism, com- mented as follows: While the civilized world resounds with the news of the death of Bis- marck, the passing away almost at the same time of Principal Caird is com- paratively unnoticed, and yet it may well be doubted whether the actual positive influence on mankind of the great statesman was so potent as the Scottish divine. The work and career of a statesman are constantly blazoned before the eyes of all men; the thinker works in his study unseen; and so, while all the world is talking of Bismarck, only a few are talking of the late Dr. Caird, whose mind was nevertheless engrossed in the highest themes to which man- kind can address itself. Scotland has been more obviously influenced in her thought by the Cairds than has any other country of our time by any two men, or than has Scotland herself during the present century by any otherthinker.' Chal- mers produced a great influence in Scotland, but not as a thinker; for, organ- izer, reformer, statesman, as he was, Chalmers was not a great thinker. The Cairds, on the contrary, have been perhaps the most striking intellects Scot- land has brought forth in our century - striking, we mean, as regards 'The italics are mine. 445</page><page sequence="2">THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY speculative thought. The more powerful thinker of the two, Dr. Edward Caird, successor of Jowett at Balliol, happily survives his less original, but still finely endowed, brother. His examination of the Kantian philosophy is one of the two or three original philosophical works that Great Britain has given to the world during the latter half of this century. It is a work which, regarded from the side of critical analysis or of a suggested constructive metaphysic, is worthy to stand in the front rank of all but the very foremost treatises on philosophy. To John Caird, however, the problem of philosophy was more urgent from another aspect. To his mind the fundamental prob- lem was to relate philosophic thinking to religion, and especially to Chris- tianity. More recently,2 in a review of John Caird's Fundamental Ideas of Christianity, with its accompanying" Memoir" of the author by Dr. Edward Caird, Professor Iverach, of Aberdeen, to whom the Glasgow group has always been under a certain suspicion, writes thus: A book which unites these distinguished brothers and places them once more side by side, though death rolls between, must be a welcome book to all who have felt their influence. What student of philosophy is there that has not fallen under their influence ? 3 Nay, whether students of philosophy 2 The Critical Review of Theological and Philosophical Literature, March, 1900, pp. 146 ff. 3 It would occupy too much space to give anything in the nature of a detailed list of the authors and teachers (with their works) who have been influenced, positively or negatively, by this movement, or who have contributed to its extension. The follow- ing selection contains, possibly, the most prominent men and, although far from com- plete, may serve to illustrate at once the strength and the extent of the movement: I. In philosophy: (I) The Scottish (chiefly Glasgow) and the Anglo-Scottish (chiefly Oxford) groups: the late Professors T. H. Green and William Wallace, the late Rev. Edwin Wallace, Arnold Toynbee, and R. L. Nettleship - all at Oxford; the late B. F. C. Costelloe (Glasgow and Oxford); Professors Edward Caird, A. C. Bradley, John MacCunn (Liverpool)-all at Glasgow and Oxford; Professors Adamson, Jones, and Smart-all at Glasgow; Professors Muirhead (Birmingham) and Ker (London)-both at Glasgow and Oxford; Professors Ritchie (St. Andrews) and Sorley (Aberdeen, now Cambridge); Professor Mackenzie (Cardiff)-Glasgow and Cambridge; Professors A. S. Pringle-Pattison (Edinburgh) and S. Alexander (Man- chester); Messrs. B. Bosanquet, F. H. Bradley, L. T. Hobhouse, R. B. Haldane, W. H. Fairbrother--all at Oxford; Messrs. John Adams, W. A. Watt, and W. S. M'Kechnie-all at Glasgow; Mr. J. Ellis McTaggart (Cambridge); Professors M. W. M'Callum and F. Anderson (Glasgow and University of Sydney, N. S. W.). (2) The Scoto-American group: the late Professors G. S. Morris (University of Michigan) and J. G. A. Dow (Glasgow and University of South Dakota); Dr. W. T. Harris and his associates in the Journal of Speculative Philosophy; Professors John Watson and J. Cappon (Glasgow and Queen's University, Canada); Professor Dyde (Queen's 446</page><page sequence="3">THE BRITISH IDEALISTIC MOVEMENT or not, few men of our generation have escaped their influence. It has spread far and wide, has permeated art, science, literature, and theology. Owing very much to them, idealism has become the dominant philosophy in England, Scotland, and America. When they began their work, it needed courage for a man to profess to be an idealist, now it takes some courage to profess anything else. Idealism has captured most of the philosophic chairs in our Scottish universities, and its familiar phraseology is heard in our sermons. The landmarks of the movement ought to be mentioned, for dates are not unimportant. As noted already, Dr. James Hutchison Stirling (The Secret of Hegel, 1865) was the pioneer, although James Frederick Ferrier, professor of moral philosophy at St. Andrews (1845-64), merits mention; for had he been spared, possibly had he received a chair in the larger University of Edinburgh, he would certainly have given new direction to University, Canada); Professors Howison (California), Royce (Harvard), Sterrett (Washington), Dewey (Chicago), Seth and Schurman (Edinburgh and Cornell), McGil- livary (Cornell), Mezes (Texas), Caldwell (Edinburgh and Northwestern), Smith (Edin- burgh and Lake Forest). II. In theology: The philosophico-theological group (chiefly Glasgow): the late Principal Caird; the late Rev. Drs. W. Mackintosh and E. B. Spiers; Professors J. Orr (Glasgow), Allan Menzies and John Herkless (St. Andrews), J. Pat- rick (Edinburgh), R. Mackintosh (Manchester), James Denney (Glasgow), T. B. Kil- patrick (Winnipeg, Manitoba); Principal Patrick (Winnipeg); Rev. Drs. G. Matheson (Edinburgh), C. Campbell (Dundee), J. Lindsay (Kilmarnock), J. Kidd (Glasgow), F. Ferguson (Glasgow), and D. W. Forrest (Skelmorlie); Rev. Messrs. A. Robinson (Crieff) and Garvie (Montrose)-all the foregoing being Glasgowgraduates; Prin- cipal Fairbairn (Mansfield College, Oxford), Rev. C. F. D'Arcy (Dublin), the Lux Mundi men. It is to be remembered of course, that many of my friends and acquaintances just mentioned -and doubtless the same holds of others unknown to me personally -would, like myself, refuse to be ticketed as members of "a school." But that one and all have been affected by the tendencies represented cannot be denied. It may be of interest to note here, further, the following passage from Pro- fessor A. Campbell Fraser's Thomas Reid (in the "Famous Scots" series): "Glasgow is in fact associated with almost all the names that adorn the literature of philosophy in Scotland in the last century and in this" (p. 74). (Hume is the great exception.) Witness Gerschom Carmichael, Francis Hutcheson, George Jardine, Archibald Alison, Adam Smith, Thomas Reid, Francis Jeffrey, John Gibson Lockhart, James Mylne, Dugald Stewart, "Christopher North," Sir William Hamilton, W. G. Sellar, Sir Alexander Grant, John Muir, John Veitch, James McCosh, Henry Calderwood, John Nichol, William Cunningham, Robert Flint, and Professor Fraser himself--all of whom either studied or taught at the University of Glasgow; and now this widespread idealistic movement. It is noteworthy, finally, that the earliest protagonist of this movement, the eminent Dr. James Hutchison Stirling (The Secret of Hegel, I865), is also a student of Glasgow origin. 447</page><page sequence="4">THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY Scottish philosophical teaching.4 In I866 Dr. Edward Caird assumed the professorship of moral philosophy at Glasgow, and thus began his intimate association with his brother John, who had been elected professor of divinity in I86I, and who became prin- cipal in I873. From this period onward we must find the chief events in the publication of books. Of these the most notable are probably as follows: Wallace's The Logic of Hegel, translated from the " Encyclopadia of the Philosophical Sciences," with Pro- legomena (1874); Edward Caird's A Critical Account of the Philosophy of Kant, with an Historical Introduction ( 877); Green's "Introduction" to his edition of Hume's Treatise of Human Nature (1878); Adamson's "Shaw Lectures" On the Philosophy of Kant (1879); John Caird's Introduction to the Philosophy of Religion (1880); Watson's Kant and His English Critics (1881), important because the first work of the second generation, so to speak-the generation of pupils, to attract widespread atten- tion; Green's Prolegomena to Ethics (1883), notable, not only in itself, but because it strikes the "ethics without dogma or theology" note so strongly repeated later by a group of the younger men. These were followed by a flood of works which testified to the force of the movement, and to the skill and influ- ence of its leaders in their capacity as teachers. Here we have the books of the discipleship period, which seems to be on the wane today. It may be added in passing that the earliest signs of a similar tendency in the United States date from the inception of the Journal of Speculative Philosophy (1867), and from the late C. C. Everett's Science of Thought (I869). In theology the symptoms were more sporadic, mainly because all teachers of this subject occupying positions of prestige in Great Britain were, and still are, bound by the confessional restrictions imposed by the national churches of England and Scotland.5 The following extracts from a prospectus prefixed to the first volume of the English translation of Keim's History of Jesus of Nazara (1873) show how the wind was blowing: 4 Ferrier's visit to Germany fell in 1834, when he undoubtedly became acquainted with the Hegelian system. 5The institution of the "Gifford Lectureships" at the four Scottish universities has done something to relieve this situation. 448</page><page sequence="5">THE BRITISH IDEALISTIC MOVEMENT A good deal has been already effected in the way of translating foreign theological literature, a series of works from the pens of Hengstenberg, Haevernick, Delitzsch, Keil, and others of the same school, having of late years been published in English, but, as the names of the authors just men- tioned will at once suggest to those conversant with the subject, the tendency of these works is for the most part conservative. It is a theological litera- ture of a more independent character, less biassed by dogmatical preposses- sions, a literature which is represented by such works as those of Ewald, Hupfeld, F. C. Baur, Zeller, Rothe, Keim, Schrader, Hausrath, N6ldeke, Pfleiderer, etc., in Germany, and by those of Kuenen, Scholten, and others, in Holland, that it is desirable to render accessible to English readers who are not familiar with the languages of the continent. The demand for works of this description is not yet so widely extended among either the clergy or the laity of Great Britain as to render it practicable for publishers to bring them out in any considerable numbers at their own risk. Among the signatories of this significant document are: Tul- loch, Jowett, Stanley, Samuel Davidson, Martineau, John Caird, Edward Caird, Sidgwick, Kegan Paul, Robert Wallace, Lewis Campbell, Cheyne, and John Muir, the orientalist, to whom the project was indebted materially for financial support. Scotch Sermons (1880) may be taken, along with Service's Salvation Here and Hereafter (I877),6 as additional indications. I am inclined to think it very probable that the tendency toward his- torical, as contrasted with dogmatic, theology, characteristic of the nineteenth century after Schleiermacher, is accountable for that absence of system which marks the theological aspects of the movement under consideration, and renders it so much easier to trace them rather in a "climate of opinion" than in any articulated body of doctrine. Regarded from this point of view, it might be said that the theologians preceded the philosophers; for it is necessary to recall Jowett's Epistles of St. Paul (I855) and the prophetic Essays and Reviews ( 860). Further, I incline to think that the desiderated theological synthesis will never be forthcoming, either in Great Britain or in the United States, from followers of the idealistic school. There are respects in which theology must always wait upon philosophy, and the new metaphysics, whatever they may owe to the Scoto-Oxonian-St. Louis groups, are likely to be more radical (and constructive) 6See my article in the New World, September, I897. 449</page><page sequence="6">THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY than anything the Hegelian purview has contained. Indeed, the Master of Balliol himself hinted at this when, in the "Memoir" of his brother, he wrote: Perhaps he did not realize-I say this only to indicate a difference between us which was never completely settled in all our discussions-how great must be the transformation of the creed of Christendom before, in the language of Goethe's well-known tale, the hut of the fisherman can be trans- formed into the altar of the great Temple of Humanity.7 Twenty years ago, when criticism of the theories attributed to the idealists, neo-Hegelians, or neo-Kantians-names are misleading in the connection-began to become increasingly insistent, the period requisite to the adjustment of perspective had not elapsed. Accordingly, the half-truth of epigram often elbowed out the whole truth of independent appreciation. Hegel's system was stigmatized a "quarry for fallacies;" folk winked as they passed the mot, "German philosophers when they die go to Oxford;" Dr. Stirling was alleged to have "kept the secret of Hegel through two thick volumes;" the "union of contradictories," judged according to the straitest letter of the old logical laws, became a fruitful subject for stinging pleasant- ries-"the true maxim is, not die to live, but diet to live;" similarly, on eminent authority, " Scotland had taken to wearing Germany's cast-off clothing." Today criticism is more serious, because more fundamental; your Hegelian cannot afford to smile his opponents down any longer. If you call him a dis- ciple, he inclines to lose his temper-never, by the way, too well controlled in some cases. At the outset, then, it is indispensable to come to some sort of understanding in respect of all that the school has accomplished. For, whether we care to admit it or not, the facts are that idealism found British (and American) thought in a definite condition, and has effected a real trans- formation during the past forty years. In strict fairness no less can be urged. Some attention must be given, therefore, to the situation upon which "neo-Hegelianism" burst. If we turn to American colleges as they were in the sixties and early seventies, a curious spectacle salutes us. Philosophy 7 The Fundamental Ideas of Christianity (Introduction, p. lxvii). 450</page><page sequence="7">THE BRITISH IDEALISTIC MOVEMENT as now understood, at least in the great universities, hardly existed, while, so far as any unified body of opinion was con- cerned, the Scottish common-sense school held the field, broken here and there by dogmatic vagaries traceable to denominational pressure.8 As we are to be concerned here with British thought chiefly, no more than this need be said. Crossing the water, the observer finds an analogous disposi- tion; one, however, marked by wide contrasts in detail, par- ticularly as concerns denominational influences. A personal reminiscence may serve to elucidate this. I recall that about the year I879 one of the most eminent of living British thinkers asked me this question: "What are you young men reading; who influences you most?" After a little reflection, I replied that the members of my circle owed most to Darwin. I then inquired: "Where were you and your contemporaries obtaining inspiration twenty-five years ago?" He replied instantly: "Carlyle." At the time when this conversation took place it might have been misinterpreted very easily. Looking back upon it from the vantage of the twentieth century, the possibility of misreading has nigh vanished. The interpretation is simple, and a good deal can be gleaned from the process. When Carlyle began to exercise vital sway over the youth, what was afoot in the intellectual centers of England and Scotland, of the latter especially, because in the mass Scotland is more intellectually inclined than her neighbor ? A superficial exami- nation results in a curious paradox. While science had become international, French, British, and Germans vying with, and consciously reacting upon, each other, reflection had remained strangely insular. For, although the thought of eighteenth- century France found expression in I-ume and Adam Smith as distinctly as in Voltaire and Rousseau, its fundamental principles served but to confirm the "British tradition" from Locke on. Things seen are eternal, things unseen are exceeding prob- lematical, possibly non-existent. In a word, even the ortho- dox dealt with the spiritual as if it were material or, at best, 8An anthology of the text-books of the time is significant, and not devoid of amusement. 45I</page><page sequence="8">THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY sensational. Curious as the situation may appear, it is quite clear now that the deists and their clerical foes fell back on identical first principles. And, thanks to the long-drawn-out domination of "natural theology" among the English-speaking peoples, the deistic attitude maintained itself far into the nineteenth century. Nevertheless, the paradox just noted fades into thin air when we recall that Paley, the Bridgewater Treatises men, and all the lesser lights whom they represented, were completely innocent of Kant, much more of Hegel; even Spinoza they knew for nothing but an unsanctified blasphemer. Hutton and Playfair, Sedgwick and Lyell, Murchison and Hugh Miller had indeed begun to apply the conception of development to the life-history of our planet, but for long the seductive idea of successive "catastrophes," with its plain corollary of successive "crea- tions," served to conceal or disguise the ultimate import of the new standpoint. The time occupied by the fact, not the fact itself, attracted adverse attention. Moreover, as has so often been the case in Britain, much of the best intellect found sufficient outlet in practical politics and in administration. Brougham, Jeffrey, Cockburn, Horner, Petty, Lord John Rus- sell here met more than enough to enlist their energies. Further, in ecclesiastical circles, the rising evangelical party was replacing the deistic quasi-Calvinism of the Moderates, replacing, that is, a force which had always made for liberty of thought by another, in compacted theory and in first principles, reactionary, and this only. Even the Oxford movement, the Anglican contemporary of the Scottish evangelical revival, although not reactionary necessarily, offered nothing constructive in the direction of philosophical theory; even if it sufficed, as it did, to render men restive under the barrenness and superficiality of current concep- tions. Individualism still maintained its pristine vitality, despite the rule of the Tories (political mediaevalists) under Wellington. Indeed, the memorable legislative reforms, falling between 1832 and I846, owe their being to this tendency. Yet, by 1832 any- thing in the nature of the Manchester school had already become a mere tradition with constructive German thinkers,9 9J. G. FICHTE, Der geschlossene Handelsstaat -the foreword of the socialistic and "social ethics" movement- dates from I8oo. 452</page><page sequence="9">THE BRITISH IDEALISTIC MOVEMENT even although it was paving the way for the rule of the English bourgeoisie, and gifting the "middle classes" a series of simple categories whereby they could regulate their lives, their politics, and, worse luck, their theology and philosophy. The alliance between the Manchester school, the Liberal party, and English associationism (in ethics, utilitarianism) resulted, so far as philo- sophical principles were concerned, in the domination of the eighteenth-century mechanical view of things spiritual, which, by the way, the Anglo-Saxon folk retain in large part to this good hour, as we cannot too often call to mind. And as the orthodox, albeit unconsciously, held by the same ultimate prin- ciples, they remained unchallenged to all intents and purposes till Carlyle's appearance. There is no god but Gladstone, and John Stuart Mill is his prophet-truly an amazing creed two generations after the Critique of Pure Reason, a quarter of a cen- tury after Hegel's Rechtsphilosophie. What matter if, as befitted, this deity were of character incalculably more complex than his prophet; he must, as always, speak to the "intelligence" of the people through the man, whose simplicitas, rendered sancta by Gladstonian benison, could be at once understood and have free course. No doubt, Newmans and Rossettis and Brownings and Holman Hunts had ventured to show their faces-but pour rire or, as it was oftener, to be blackguarded roundly. Not this man, but Barabbas! Their time had not yet come. Nevertheless, astonished as we may well be today when we come to face the facts, what else could one expect from a community in whose chief center of intellectual prestige a Mansel was acclaimed savior of the situation? A strenuous, but cramped generation, it accomplished much for justice as against privilege, but it paid the price, in effecting naught for spiritual insight as against analytic understanding. The children of this world overcame the children of light and held them in durance vile. So much so that we who live in another atmosphere find it far more diffi- cult to rethink the conditions incident to this age than to enter into sympathy with those characteristic of the " Revival of Let- ters," or to discover near affinities in the spacious conceptions of the Athenian sages. For criticism is destructive, disintegrating 453</page><page sequence="10">THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY no longer; it must be appreciative, constructive; the historical method has left us no talents to roll up in a napkin and to bury; we are enjoined to put them out to usury, induced often, in spite of our Anglo-Saxon "self-help." Tradition with its mechanical categories happens to be at such a discount that we are nigh unable to comprehend a tithe of all it meant when the "Great White Queen" stepped to the British throne. It remains to attempt a vague realization of this social consciousness by con- descending upon some few particulars. In Scotland particularly politico-ecclesiastical questions were uppermost in men's minds. The methods used to prevent Ferrier's election (I856) to the chair of logic and metaphysics in the University of Edinburgh are still in vogue, unhappily-they have been employed twice within the last few years; but no one would now dare to beat the drum ecclesiastic in face of the public. The idea that a thinker is to be bound beforehand to teach a certain kind of philosophy, the more milk and water the better, is now as dead as the notion that a chemist must incul- cate phlogiston or a physicist the conception of a first cause "'eminently acquainted with the problems of geometry." But what might be expected from an environment in which, eight years later than the Ferrier fama, a prominent leader of the Free Church was voted down for a professorship by the pres- bytery of Edinburgh because, forsooth, he had suggested that other forms of church government than the one favored by his own little communion might possess good points? This, when Lyell and Darwin and "George Eliot" had done some of their most significant work, and had raised problems connected with life and mind destined to alter the entire outlook upon the meaning of the universe! As was well said at the time in the columns of the leading Scottish newspaper: "There is here another proof of a fact we have long known and felt, that with many people the chief of heresies is toleration; and that, though there are many sins, the greatest of these is charity." Even within the Church of Scotland, where a liberalizing party was surely, if slowly, raising its head, endless time was devoted to puerile discussion about the use of organs in public worship, 454</page><page sequence="11">THE BRITISH IDEALISTIC MOVEMENT read prayers, and the like; while the proposal to relieve the laity, called to serve in the eldership, from the obligation of subscribing the Westminster Confession raised a tempest. What are we to think of the state of mind whence the following emerged so late as 1864 ? " Heresy is creeping in through very narrow meshes. We have the poison of the Essays and Reviews creeping in through the veins of the talented, the philosophical, and the learned; we have the false arithmetic of Colenso making the books of Moses a cunningly devised fable; we have Renan's History of Christ, in which our Savior is painted in terms so beautiful as to make him a moon-eyed enthusiast and an unworthy impostor. Are these the times in which we are to remove the landmarks of our fathers?" Yes, "the landmarks of our fathers"-dualism, mechanism, supernaturalism, and similar assorted superstitions or ignorances-were the themes that interested. "Poison creeping in" from the present arch- bishop of Canterbury, from the greatest force for educational progress nineteenth-century Oxford saw, from Baden Powell, or from H. B. Wilson, is supremely amusing as things stand now; and poor Colenso's arithmetic would but ill bear comparison, in its influence on ideas of Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch, with much taught as commonplace today in our most obscurantist seminaries of theology. What kind of people were they, one of whose most sainted church leaders could say publicly, without provoking the ghost of a smile, and speaking of the American Civil War, "God has begun to ride his bloody circuit, and the cup of judgment is to go round" ? Small wonder that the most approved works of this period, dealing with moral and spiritual problems, abound in pitiful banalities. Gross anthropomorphism, extending even to minor details, marks too often the prevalent ideas about deity; Jesus frequently appears as a strictly official personage, whose office seems to have been to overturn the foundations of morality by some extramundane hocus-pocus. "He came as their substitute, to answer for transgressors; to take upon his own head their guilt and doom, that a righteous sentence of legal and judicial acquittal may, by the Father's grace, be freely theirs." The ethical conceptions, so conspicuous 455</page><page sequence="12">456 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY today, and saddling man the individual with responsibility for cobperation with God, have not dawned. The realm of nature is burked or flouted with curious frequency, and authoritative books, when secular, receive nauseous praise or unmitigated condemnation, both flowing from preconceived dogmas; when sacred, are twisted to bolster up mediaval propositions, and this in a manner utterly devoid of historical proportion. The ques- tions, What is nature? and, How did these books come to be written at all ? never occur. In short, the historical and com- parative methods, like the idea of development, are conspicuous by their absence. Dualism reigns everywhere. God versus the world, conventional saint versus conventional sinner, natural versus revealed theology, spirit versus nature, the law versus grace-all the old, familiar contradictions serve to generate all the old, familiar puzzles; oppositions that are no oppositions shoot forth problems that are no problems. And when at length construction begins-as, for example, with Darwin-the insensate attacks of "creationists" reveal the same lack of insight, of the cosmic sense. There is no feeling for the things which cannot be shaken. Lyell, then Colenso, then Darwin evoke a crescendo of abuse which, at this date, not merely raises a laugh, but calls forth pity, if not scorn, for its blind authors. People had learned nothing, had forgotten nothing. "If the development theory of the origin of man shall, in a little while, take the place-as it doubtless will- with other exploded scientific speculations, then they who accept it with its proper logical consequences will, in the life to come, have their portion with those who in this life ' know not God and obey not the gospel of his Son.'" America is respon- sible for this vapid vaticination. It is a "brutal philosophy, to wit, there is no God, and the ape is our Adam;" "the principle of natural selection is absolutely incompatible with the word of God;" "it contradicts the revealed relations of the creation to its Creator;" "a huge imposture, doing away with all idea of God, turning the Creator out of doors "-these are some stray antiques gleaned from this period, near in time, but immeasurably dis- tant in habits of thought. For they betray an incompetence to</page><page sequence="13">THE BRITISH IDEALISTIC MOVEMENT grasp the organic view which we, who are permeated by it, can hardly credit. And the point is that we cannot give their due to the English-speaking idealists till we call to mind that it was upon such a world they intruded. In the main, this was what they found. Our further task must be to see what they taught and what they have bequeathed. To begin with, the history of the course of the movement merits notice. The direction it took, as I have tried to show briefly in another place and connection,?1 is by no means parallel to that followed in Germany, as Professor Otto Pfleiderer sug- gested." There was a long period of incubation, during which, strange as it may seem today, the great systems of the Kantian school, in their fundamental implications, attracted and received little notice. Possibly this may be traceable to the fact that the German language had not diffused itself widely in Britain, and the rage for translation lay still in the future. In any case, although Coleridge had studied Lessing and Jacobi, Kant and Schelling, he obtained no more than a general point of view. In a single instance, perhaps, he did light on something deeper, for the Kantian distinction between Verstand and Vernunft took strong hold on his imagination. Yet neither he nor De Quincey put forth the effort requisite to mastery over Kant. And there is no evidence that the poet discovered more in Schelling than the outpourings of a sympathetic genius. Carlyle reached, the case becomes even more striking. His equipment, vastly superior to that of his predecessors, might have resulted in a veritable trans- fusion of the Herder-to-Hegel intellectual temperament. We know that it did nothing of the kind. For Carlyle, thanks to the imperious demands of the interests that lent him character, neither stayed to probe the roots of idealism in Kant, nor pro- ceeded to think through the constructive expression in Hegel. He began and ended midmost-with Goethe and Fichte. For the rest, he conquered by the inward passion of his own towering personality. Accordingly, ere idealism came to capture the IO InternationalJournal of Ethics, April, 892, p. 40 I. " Development of Theology, pp. 303 f. (first edition, where this tendency is most marked). 457</page><page sequence="14">THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY centers of English-speaking culture, a long period of general preparation-sporadic and critical and literary rather than sys- tematic, constructive, and philosophical-had elapsed. It remained to rationalize, as it were, the suggestions of "tran- scendentalists," the insights of seers, and to bring them home, first, to the educated youth, then, through such converts, to the average man. Thus, although signs of effervescence may be traced so far back as the second decade of the nineteenth century, the idealistic "idea of development" postdates the Origin of Species. No doubt, Dr. Stirling's "long and earnest labor" con- stitutes the last link between the days of "vague immensities" and those of philosophical Wissenschaft. For, referring to his commerce with Kant and Hegel, in the preliminary notice to the first edition of The Secret of Hegel, he wrote as follows: This is the last fruit, though first published, of a long and earnest labor devoted, in the main, to two men only- Kant and Hegel, and more closely, in the main also, to the three principal works (the Kritiken) of the one, and the two principal works (The Logic and The Encyclopaedia) of the other. This study has been the writer's chief-not just to say sole-occupation during a greater number of years, and for a greater number of hours in each day of these years, than it is perhaps prudent to avow at present. The period of scholarship and of philosophical quickening, which thus opened, divides itself naturally, for one who is familiar with it, into three fairly definite stages, although, as is usual in similar cases, they overlap. First came the discovery of the Hegelian system and appreciation of its vast importance. The characteristic productions of this initiatory time are the translations (from Hegel) of Dr. Stirling and of the late Pro- fessor Wallace. A second outgrowth followed, the result mainly of the demands made upon the leading idealists in their situa- tion as academic teachers. A new reading of the history of philosophy, an interpretation of the origins of idealism itself, and a critical-constructive reaction upon the fundamental positions of the traditional British standpoint, were the main consequences. These may be traced easily in Dr. E. Caird's first work on Kant, in the late T. H. Green's destructive distillation of Locke, Berkeley, and Hume, now published in the first volume of his collected Works, and in Professor Adamson's lectures On 458</page><page sequence="15">THE BRITISH IDEALISTIC MOVEMENT Kant. Of course, we must remember that the years of academic teaching intercalate with those of discovery. Dr. Caird and T. H. Green began to teach in I866, at Glasgow and Oxford respectively, and Wallace, also at Oxford, two years later. But the published results go over for a decade. By the late seventies and the eighties a third stage has arrived. For want of a more suitable descriptive title, we call it the period of discipleship, even if adverse criticism begins to sound a minor note. But with this last we are not to deal here. The pupils of the four great teachers-the brothers Caird, Green, and Wallace-now make themselves heard, and it becomes evident that certain marked lines-possibly lines of least resistance, certainly lines of real constructive interest-are being followed up. The absence of a large output of systematic writing in pure philoso- phy at once causes comment-Drs. F. H. Bradley and Bernard Bosanquet conspicuous by exception; while the strong attrac- tion exerted by ethical, political, theological, and even literary subjects strikes one vividly. Here the wide divergence between German and British conditions, with the resultant effects, appear on the most cursory examination. As everyone is vaguely aware, the English universities have often been subjected to the criticism that their contributions to scholarship bear no propor- tion to their wealth and other opportunities. Whether this be true or false, no estimate of these institutions does them even- handed justice unless it make account of all they have done, and continue to do, for the administration of the empire. Balliol Col- lege, for example, by its tradition for scholarship, may have acquired an enviable preeminence among its peers. Yet, as likely as not, the first Balliol man you happen to meet will have little to say of this; but he will surely tell you that his " society " is responsible for the last three governors-general of India. Further, the great mass of English students are subjected to the silent, formative pressure of the "public schools," a process which continues naturally, and propagates itself, in the colleges of Oxford and Cambridge. Indeed, English university educa- tion has been molded extensively by this very influence, and so political and ethico-social problems attract many of the ables 459</page><page sequence="16">460 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY students. The staples of the Oxford "schools," Plato's Dia- logues and Aristotle's Ethics, face in the same direction. The contributions of Green's pupils, and of others belonging to the contemporary generation of English scholars, to such problems, have possessed their own distinctive note, and are more than likely to exert influence in future, particularly on the "platform" of the Liberal party. In this connection it is unnecessary to do more than mention the publications of Arnold Toynbee and of Dr. James Bonar, of Professors MacCunn, Ritchie, Mackenzie, and F. C. Montague. In Scotland, on the other hand, the tendency of the uni- versities has been toward the production of men of strong, sometimes unregulated, individuality. "It is matter of regret," wrote the late Professor Nichol, of Glasgow, " that there is so much in our university system to encourage mere activity; so little that tends to moderate and tranquillize; so little that recalls the great distinction between the love of excellence and the love of excelling, or emphasizes the fact that it is not what a human being knows, but what he is, that concerns us. To most men hard work of some sort is a necessity; but mere energy requires direction, sometimes restraint." In other words, the Scottish uni- versities are what the national character has made them, and their arrangements tend to intensify popular qualities. There the social atmosphere generated by the English "public school" has absolutely no place. At the same time, Scotsmen possess a rallying-point in their national Presbyterianism, and a majority of the most promising philosophical students, twenty years ago, looked to the church as their life-work; if not to the church, then to academic teaching under circumstances where the problems naturally incident to the church were the prominent, though by no means exclusive, concern. Thus we find that, while the political and ethical nuance of idealism in its second generation belongs to the English universities, and to those Scots-and they are many-who took a course there, the theological line was continued rather in the northern kingdom and under its ethos. Thereby hangs a tale. Till 890, if not somewhat later, the inner temper of each of the</page><page sequence="17">THE BRITISH IDEALISTIC MO VEME/NT three large Presbyterian bodies-the Church of Scotland, the Free Church, and the United Presbyterian Church I- was not by any means identical. The state church was associated in many minds with latitudinarianism; the Free Church, with evan- gelical conservatism-witness the dismissal of Robertson Smith, and the suspicion cast on Professors Bruce and Dods, which lingers still; the United Presbyterian Church occupied middle ground, leaning, on the whole, toward the conservative attitude. Accordingly, we find a right, a center, and a left, all the out- come, to a large degree, of the national situation in matters ecclesiastical.'3 It were wiser, however, to drop names asso- ciated with the internal division of the German Hegelians, and to fall back on a broader method of distinction. Regarded thus, it may be said that there were, and still are, those who, whether consciously or unconsciously, on the occasion of a conflict between philosophical principles and theological pre- suppositions, permitted the latter to overcome the former. Of this attitude, The Christian View of God and the World, by Professor James Orr, now of Glasgow, formerly of Edinburgh, is a good illustration. Others, again, tended to identify philosophy and theology. This seems characteristic of Principal Caird's Funda- mental Ideas of Christianity, as the quotation given above indi- cates.'4 A third class more than hinted that philosophical principles must be thought through to their legitimate conclu- sions, and theological doctrines be left to take the consequences. The late Dr. Mackintosh, in his Natural History of the Christian Religion (probably the most remarkable of the idealistic con- tributions to theology), and Dr. Edward Caird, in his Evolution of Religion (the second volume particularly), point in some such 12 The Free Church and the United Presbyterian Church ceased to exist as separate denominations in the autumn of 1900; they consolidated then, by mutual consent, under the title of the United Free Church. 3 True fifteen years ago, this scarcely holds today. The orthodox wing in the Church of Scotland appears to have gained the upper hand again, under the very interesting guise (for Presbyterianism) of a "high church," patristic, even sacramen- tarian movement. On the other hand, the Free Church has become broader in its theology, although it remains evangelical in its Christianity. 4 See p. 450. 461</page><page sequence="18">THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF 7HEOLOGY direction. The Saviour in the Newer Light, although it entirely lacks the power of the works just mentioned, has special interest in that it caused the deposition of its author, Mr. Alexander Robinson, from the ministry of the Church of Scotland, several years ago. This circumstance, among others, warrants the state- ment that the "right and the center," particularly the former, have molded churchmen in Scotland; the lay element has not yet brought forth representatives, interested in theology, numer- ous enough to afford basis for judgment; even if, as it is impor- tant to note, Dr. E. Caird is a layman, and the late Dr. Mackintosh resigned from the ministry ere he published his masterful book. In briefest outline, then, such is the history of the rise and extension of this tendency in thought. When confronted abruptly with the question, What did the idealists teach ? one must confess that, in some respects, a clear- cut reply cannot be furnished easily. As idealism has gone, the English stem came late, and much had happened ere it bore its own fruit. For example, the disruption of the German Hegelian school raised problems, and also removed difficulties, even if it promoted causes of misunderstanding. Moreover, the progress of science, epecially under the agis of Darwin, dif- fused a new atmosphere, and imparted tendencies that Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel himself did not experience. To be just, the British-American idealists do possess reasons for grievance when, as the fashion of some is, they are roundly dismissed for mere disciples and copyists. A simple reproduction of " Kant and the Epigones" ought not to be anticipated. In matters philosophical, different skies mean different moods. Taking our question first in its more general aspect, a precise answer lies ready to hand. The " neo-Hegelian" movement brought the secluded thought of British and American culture into vital relation with what may be called the nineteenth-cen- tury philosophico-theological point of view. If Aristotle taught philosophy to speak Greek, Descartes transferred the proverb to French, Bacon and Hobbes and Locke to English. Equally, Kant and his successors made German the dominant tongue. 462</page><page sequence="19">THE BRITISH IDEALISTIC MOVEMENT Now this final achievement had stood for a generation when Coleridge discovered, and appropriated,I5 Schelling. And, when we survey this generation, we find that the Kantians effected so much for the same reasons as did Aristotle. A national, or rather racial, efflorescence supplied occasion, material, and motive-force. A Janus-like paradox arises here. First, at no time had English literature been so influential in Germany and in Europe. Its freedom and freshness won upon many foreign- ers. But the freedom happened to be a result of political con- ditions pregnant with individualism, while the freshness flowed from the discovery of strange things worthy of admiration in the old ballads, in country life or scenes, in common folk in their average moments, as the nascent novel shows. This kind of freedom and freshness was not the affair with which the Teutonic spirit was to concern itself, and to return later to Eng- land by way of paying off a loan. For, secondly, German civili- zation, after the middle of the eighteenth century, is remarkable mainly for the formation of a social and historical sense alien entirely to the British spirit of that day. Further, thrown back on themselves by poverty of civic opportunity, Kant, with the rest, rendered life concentric to the culture of the individual-Goethe standing forth the classical type. This culture, in turn, origi- nated and was the new thing that may be termed the nineteenth- century standpoint. While the British, having won, or being on the highroad toward winning, political enfranchisement, pro- ceeded to theorize concerning the abstract rights of the abstract individual, which they associated with it, the Germans, deprived of political outlet, proceeded to discover the principles under- lying the relation between a man and his social environment. They extended this inquiry to all realms then known, and so formulated the kulturhistorische mode of thought, a tendency so alien from the English tradition that our very language lacks names, and even phrases, to convey it. This Teutonic develop- ment, to which such categories as evolution, organism, rela- tionship, social pressure, and the like, are so essential, found 5 For the most accurate account of Coleridge's relation to Schelling see Black- wood's Magazine, March, I840.

Ferrier is the author of the article. 463</page><page sequence="20">THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY representative expression in Winckelmann as early as 1755; with Lessing's Education of the Human Race (1780), Herder's Spirit of Hebrew Poetry (1782), and Ideen (I784-9), it had already received full-throated statement. Whether in art, in literature, in political philosophizing, in jurisprudence, or in reflection proper, the conception of the "social-individual" was winning its transforming way everywhere. In a word, a general outlook, not far removed from that of Darwin, but applied in the sphere of things ideal, was gaining a rapid mastery. It is the glory of the British idealistic movement to have brought authentic news of this renaissance to English culture. It was an achieve- ment the vast importance of which we do not yet fathom sufficiently. For the bones, left dry by an outworn "classicism' and a disintegrating individualism, were shaken, and came together, bone to his bone, and the breath came to them, and they lived, and stood upon their feet. This, the general aspect of the teaching, affords a clue lead- ing straight to the particular doctrines. For it implies that analysis, colligation, external classification have been dispos- sessed by synthesis, relationship, and internal self-expression as part of an organic whole. In one word, dialectic rules the uni- verse of human experience. To be sure, not necessarily the formal dialectic of Hegel; but the conception of immanent principle pervading individual things, of individual things as coming to their individuality in proportion as they reveal this universal (immanent) element. What does this mean ? It is safer to let a representative writer make reply: Even in the hypothetically assumed case that there is only an ideal nature in the consciousness of thinking minds, we could not escape from the question how the different subjects come to a corresponding image of the world, and how they are able to distinguish what is merely subjectively rep- resented from the common or objective mode of representation-that is to say, how they can distinguish truth from error. This question, however, can hardly be solved otherwise than by the assumption of a universal conscious- ness which must be the common ground, as well as the ruling law, of all indi- vidual consciousnesses or minds. .... If it holds true of the individual being that the final end which results from the development of its life is also already the ideal prius of the whole process, then we shall be able to apply the same thought to the whole process of the life of our earth, and to draw 464</page><page sequence="21">THE BRITISH IDEALISTIC MOVEMENT therefrom a conclusion as to the principle of the process. And we are justi- fied in doing so by the very fundamental thought of modern biology, accord- ing to which all the life of the earth forms one advancing development from the lowest to the highest forms of existence. .... If, therefore, the whole history of the world shows itself as the teleologicalprocess of the advancing realization of the divine purpose of the world, we are entitled to find in the history of the world the revelation of the world-governing wisdom of God.16 From the traditional English point of view, this is "clapping of wings to all the solid old lumber of the world" with a ven- geance. And the amazement, not to say searching of heart, caused could not fail to increase as the successive applications made their appearance in detail. One point in particular must be blazoned forth constantly. No matter how completely we may tend to lose ourselves in the ramifications of the system, we must always remember that its pivotal center is history. The historical method, applied to cul- ture (Kultur), constitutes its main distinctive mark. What this implies has been stated vividly, possibly most vividly, by certain literary investigators. When Gustav Freytag, speaking of his Bilder aus der deutschen Vergangenheit ( 1858), calls it "a picture of the growth of our national soul during the last two thousand years," he states as succinctly as may be the precise situation. And he elaborates this view, on its universal side, in the same forthright manner: What is printed here from old documents are largely reports of men of the past about their own experiences, not infrequently insignificant incidents in the life of the common crowd. But just as every gesture of a strange man whom we meet for the first time, his address, his first words, give us the image of a fixed personality, an imperfect an unfinished image, to be sure, but yet a whole; so every document in which the life of an individual is revealed has, if we mistake not, the curious effect of bringing before us with a sudden clearness an image of the life of the people; a very incomplete and unsatis- factory image, yet likewise a whole, around which a large variety of ideas and facts, stored up in our mind, flash-like shoot together, as crystals round their center. .... Millions of individuals make the people, in millions of souls the life of the people is pulsating, but the conscious and unconscious working together of the millions produces a spiritual content in which, at times at least, the soul of the whole people appears as a living, self-creating unity. i6 0. PFLEIDERER, The Philosophy and Development of Religion, Vol. I, pp. 142, 156, 157, 202. 465</page><page sequence="22">THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY Similarly, with his eye now on the individual side, W. H. Riehl declares: The age, that is, the nation at a particular stage of its development, creates the man and the man helps to create his age,; every epoch-making mind is at the same time father and child, disciple and master of his age, and the more fully he surrenders himself to it, the more fully will he control it. The pronouncements are unmistakable. The individual is caught up in the network of a tremendous process; to be himself, to know himself, he must be and know the process. Now, it is just in such aspects of the idealistic theory that the English- speaking group happens to have developed its greatest strength, because it was precisely on this side that English insularity most needed awakening. In reviewing the matter, we may confine ourselves to questions either directly or indirectly of theological interest. As the passages cited suggest very clearly, brushing aside the intervening details, we arrive at the bedrock of principle when we reach the fundamental problems of God, the universe, and man. What is God? What is the ultimate nature of the universe ? What is the meaning of man's life ? This last, be it observed, demands that the first and second be solved, for it implies a settled conception of the interrelationship between God, the universe, and man. Now, the idealistic theory presents so many facets that it is by no means easy to focus the rays exactly on any one of these problems. A general tendency must therefore suffice; and if, in describing this, we do some unfairness to individual authors, the movement with which they are associated must bear the blame. The idealistic conception of Deity stands in strongly marked contrast to the older conception it has done so much to displace. The idea formulated by the Latin theologians persisted after the Reformation through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, thanks to its affinity for the Newtonian philosophy and for nat- ural theology. Few are familiar with its implications now, much more nearly akin though they are to popular anthropomorphism than the later view. For, as a rule, men take the belated Cartesian exposition as a matter of course, not of inquiry. Summarily stated, 466</page><page sequence="23">THE BRITISH IDEALISTIC MOVEMENT this popular theory separates God from the world and conceives of him as interfering with the natural order in the same way as an artificer might use his materials, or an experimenter discover compounds, or an executive enforce laws. Idealism, especially in the legitimate Hegelian line, would have none of this. On the dialectic theory, a worldless god and a godless world are equally irrational, equally impossible. On the contrary, God pervades the universe. Immanence, rather than transcendence, marks the character of the real relationship. Or, the doctrine does not set out with transcendence, but infers it from immanence, making it, in this sense, a secondary consideration. An evaporation -as a historical fact, a more or less complete evaporation-of the traditional supernaturalism follows from such a view. Whatever happens, without exception, must be regarded, not only as a natural event, but also as an event deriving from divine neces- sity. " Or if we prefer to have it so, let it be said that the order of the universe is the natural supernatural, by which is meant that the divine or supernatural element is never and nowhere absent, but also not more present in the spiritual than in the physical life, in the religious than in the secular and political sphere of human history." For example, natural law cannot be viewed as a system with which God interferes now and then, from an external vantage-ground. The system itself constitutes an essential part of God. It is not our present business to com- ment upon this theory. Suffice it to point out that the conclu- sions to which it leads quite logically are of a kind to rule out all the traditional ground-dogmas distinctive of theology from Augustine down. They are in sharpest conflict with the mechani- cal and static categories peculiar to Calvinism, or, for that matter, any other "ism" that has carried weight since the Reformation. It makes no difference to the ultimate facts that, during the past generation, many have accepted this theory without recking the consequences. This has happened time and again under the influence of those mystic intuitions of it pro- ceeding from our modern English poets, like Browning and his wife. 467</page><page sequence="24">THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY Truth, so far, in my book: the truth which draws Through all things upwards-that a two-fold world Must go to a perfect cosmos.

Earth's crammed with heaven, And every common bush afire with God.17 One of the most pressing needs of contemporary theological thought appears in this connection. British and American theologians owe it to themselves, to the peoples they represent, to the clarification, if not the advance, of thought, to come to a clear understanding respecting the conclusions involved; to embrace or reject them, adducing reasons, in the light of modern science, whether biblical, historical, archaological, physical, or biological. Possibly a restatement of philosophy of religion, consonant with current demands, would accomplish this work most efficiently. In any case, whether we recognize it or not, the idealistic conception of God and- its derivants find free course everywhere, and have created a situation where lack of decisive thinking cannot be tolerated much longer. The idealistic theory of the universe follows from, is the natural corollary to, its God-intoxication, in Hegel's phrase. The essence of the matter centers in the comprehension that the 17 MRS. BROWNING, in Aurora Leigh, Book vii. 468</page><page sequence="25">THE BRITISH IDEALISTIC MO VEMENT universe is a universe. That is to say, the imperative injunction runs that it must be regarded as a single whole, inspired by an inward principle of unity; as a mighty fact, capable of being probed only in so far as this principle can prove itself amenable to the categories of human experience. Mysteries are not many; mystery is one. Matter and life and mind are all equally mysterious, or, if you please, their mysteriousness dis- appears on inspection, giving place to the final mysteriousness of the vast organism whose characteristic "manifestations" they are. The universe can be classed as a cosmos, therefore, but only because an inward power shoots through it, for in the light of this power alone can aught suffer explanation, can aught be suffered to possess reality. In a sense such a universal may be beyond knowledge; not, however, because it is too vague and general for definite thought, but for the opposite reason, that it is inexhaustible. It hides itself, if at all, not in darkness, but in light. It is the ground on which we stand, the atmosphere which surrounds us, the light by which we see, and the heaven that shuts us in. It is not only in all, but to all, and through all. "Intra cuncta nec inclusus, Extra cuncta nec exclusus." But, just for that reason, everything we know is a contribution to the knowledge of it, and nothing can be really known apart from it. For if it be true that our intelligence is organic, it cannot but grow by the evolution of its first principle, and every differentiation of its organs and functions must bring with it, or after it, a new integration; which in this case means a deepening knowledge of the principle itself.'8 Here, too, as in the former case, fundamental positions, of capital importance, call for scrutiny. How fundamental, few have seen or, seeing, have cared to admit. The late Dr. Mackintosh, after his custom, minced no words, blinked no inferences: At no point is it permissible to call in the idea of an exceptional exertion of divine power, whether immanent or transcendent, supplementary to that which is eternally operative. It may be long before the theological mind becomes familiarized with this scientific, anti-supernaturalistic conception of the divine relation to the universe. But until this conception is embraced, theology will remain, as it now is, in a deadlock, with no possibility of advance in any direction whatever.'9 18 E. CAIRD, The Evolution of Religion, Vol. I, pp. I53, 154. 19 The Natural History of the Christian Religion, p. 35. 469</page><page sequence="26">THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY As before, these doctrines are in the very air we breathe. Yet small effort has been put forth to lay bare their final conclusions. We have yet to reckon with the idealistic construction. Finally, the anthropology flows from the cosmology, because man happens to form an integral part of the scheme of things. Further, "man is still man within the area of Christendom." Developed in the "natural supernatural" course of events, human nature bears with it its own characteristic "manifesta- tion" of the immanent divine principle. So far as finite eye can see, this is the goal, the ideal end toward which the grandiose labor of the time-spirit has been moving. And, just because the goal must be called ideal, man occupies the unique position of being a direct co-worker with God. As Carlyle has it: "God mend all! Nay, by God! we must help him to mend it!" Through this thrilling conception most of all, possibly, the idealistic philosophy has won supporters. For it is supremely fascinating, and may be handled with amazing flexibility. Leav- ing free play for the teachings of modern biological science, it yet affords spacious office for the most uplifting, and ethical, interpretation of life and experience. Something akin to veritable inspiration vibrates in these plangent words, to take but a single example of the exposition: Amidst the limitations of our earthly life, in the atmosphere of worldly interest and passion, amidst the perturbations of the life of sense, there is for the saintliest of men much to interrupt the consciousness of the presence of God within them, and to arrest the flow of that current of thought and feeling which unites the life of man to the life of God. In the struggle with their lower self they are conscious of boundless possibilities which are only feebly and fitfully realized, of hopes and aspirations to which, even when the will to realize them is present, the results in the actual life are miserably disproportionate. Nevertheless, the ideal divine-human life is not a mere dream of the pious imagination. It is not merely theoretically, as a matter of speculation, that we can conceive of the absolute union of the human and the divine, nor is the splendor of spiritual greatness, hid under this vesture of decay, only at best a dim forecast or far-off prevision. It is the very central fact of our Christian faith that once for all it has been realized, and that in the person and life of Christ we can recognize a nature from which every dividing, disturbing element has passed away-a mind that was the pure medium of Infinite Intelligence, a heart that throbbed in perfect unison with the Infinite Love, a will that never vibrated by one faintest aberration 470</page><page sequence="27">THE BRITISH IDEALISTIC MOVEMENT from the Infinite Will, a human consciousness possessed and suffused by the very spirit and life of the Living God.20 It happens that this is typical of the presentation whereby idealism has won upon many. I speak here of what I know at first-hand. Multitudes, these last thirty years, have had no recourse but to cut loose from dogmatic Christianity; neverthe- less they have been loth to forget that they owed more than they could tell to the religion of Jesus and to the institutions of its creation, notably the church, for much that was worth while in life. To such, a message of this sort came as a water-spring in a dry land. Whether, as thus stated, it consorts with the views of God and of the universe just adduced is another affair. Moreover, it contains a question which cannot be settled until we have taken the entire point of view more seriously, and have attempted to elucidate its implications thoroughly. Thus this English idealistic movement refuses to be treated as a dead issue, or as a blast that has passed, leaving mere wreckage of history. Indeed, one performs no more than his duty when he declares that this happens to be true in the theo- logical sphere preeminently. A mass of what, for lack of a native title, must be called schillernd work has been thrust upon the market from the idealistic-theological, or quasi-theological, side. Possibly some would allege that a share of the guilt comes very near home. I do not believe for a moment that the writers have deceived themselves. But, nevertheless, sense of gain, of constructive possibility in an age of difficulty, has over- come or overlain the need for sharply outlined statement of first principles. When these receive this exposition it will be pos- sible to draw the unavoidable conclusions, and not till then. This remains one task for the twentieth century; small matter whether, in the sequel, we resile or go farther; we shall at least know how we stand. At the moment confusion reigns too rampant for credit, if not for comfort. And at such great assize comfort cuts but little figure. There is a great call to the idealist to know and to be known. At the same time, justice demands that the philosophers bear the burden of blame with 2 JOHN CAIRD, The Fundamental Ideas of Christianity, Vol. II, pp. I70, 171. 471</page><page sequence="28">472 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY the theologians. For it were difficult to recall the epoch when theological thought received such scant measure from funda- mental metaphysical inquiry. Theology might even plead that she could not count the cost, because philosophy, although pre- senting the bill at intervals and in a half-apologetic fashion, did not insist upon instant payment in full. Of course, the possi- bility remains that the idea may already have brought death to the sect which propagated it. But, even at this, the idea remains, rooted in such sacrifice. So that philosophers are nowise absolved from undertaking the enlightenment demanded.</page></plain_text>
