<plain_text><page sequence="1">Winifred and Joseph Gales, Liberals in the Old South BY CLEMENT EATON Pericles in his Funeral Oration praised the Athenians for their tol- erance. According to the report of Thucydides, he said: "Not only in our public life are we liberal, but in our private intercourse we are not suspicious of one another nor angry with our neighbor if he does what he likes, nor do we put on sour looks at him which, though harmless, are not pleasant." Something of this admirable attitude of the Athe- nians of the fifth century was demonstrated in the society of the Upper South during the first quarter of the nineteenth century. The case of Winifred and Joseph Gales presents an attractive picture of tolerance in the urban society of North Carolina during this period. Joseph Gales was an antislavery man and a Unitarian, views that did not prevent him from being mayor of Raleigh for nineteen years and the editor of the leading newspaper of the state. Winifred, his wife, was one of the genuinely intellectual women of the Old South, who occupied a rather singular position in a society that hampered the intellectual develop- ment of women by the restraints of the romantic stereotype. They were not native-born Southerners, but were refugees from Eng- land who became acclimated in the South. Joseph Gales was born in Eckington, near Sheffield, England, the son of the village schoolteacher. He was apprenticed to the printer's trade at Newark-on-Trent. Here he met Winifred Marshall, a cousin of Lord Melbourne, whom he mar- ried. They established their home in Sheffield, where Joseph Gales in 1787 founded the Sheffield Register. Their home became a rendezvous for reformers and free thinkers. Gales was a champion of the liberal movements stirring England at the close of the eighteenth century, the</page><page sequence="2">462 THE JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN HISTORY cause of labor, the efforts to abolish imprisonment for debt, the emanci- pation of the slaves, and the adoption of manhood suffrage. In his bookshop he sold the writings of Thomas Paine, and he expressed strong sympathy for the French Revolution. His criticisms of the conservative government of William Pitt the Younger led to his exile from England. He fled to Altona, in Holstein, and to Hamburg, where Winifred joined him after the sale of the bookshop and newspaper in England. Winifred always remembered gratefully the kindness of the people of Germany, "where we first sought an asylum from the oppression of a corrupt administration."' Here Joseph Gales learned the skill of writing short- hand, which proved later to be of immense advantage to him in his 2 career as a newspaper man. In 1795 he brought his family across the Atlantic to Philadelphia. In this capital of the United States he resumed his profession of free lance editor. Purchasing the Independent Gazetteer, he changed its name to Gales's Independent Gazetteer, the first issue of which came from the press on September 16, 1796. His prospectus promised his subscribers that he would give an impartial relation of political measures, report the Congressional debates, furnish authentic foreign news, and publish poetry and essays.3 It was dominated by a humanitarian spirit, contain- ing articles against the slave trade, on the folly and wickedness of war, and in favor of a liberal policy toward immigrants. Gales also wrote sympathetically of the religious reformer, Dr. Joseph Priestley, who was giving lectures in Philadelphia, praising him for his "virtuous tranquility of mind,"4 which his persecutors did not enjoy.

The Federalist newspaper, the North Carolina Minerva, had a monoply of the field, and an organ of the opposition party was badly needed in the state. Nathaniel Macon, the Jeffersonian leader of North Carolina, persuaded Gales to locate in Raleigh and edit a Republican organ.5 On October 22, 1799, he founded the Raleigh Register, named after the Sheffield Register in England. The next year he was elected state printer by the victorious Republicans, an office which amounted to a form of subsidy and which he continued to hold until after the election of President Jackson. In 1832 he left the opera- tion of the Register and his multifarious business enterprises, including a paper mill, to his son, Weston, while he and Mrs. Gales moved to Washington, D. C.6 The pre-eminence of Gales as a newspaper editor and publisher in North Carolina was due to a variety of factors. In Philadelphia he had been a pioneer in reporting the debates of Congress, using his recently acquired skill of shorthand, and on his removal to North Carolina he introduced this practice in the Raleigh Register.' Furthermore, he in- creased its circulation by sending copies of his newspaper gratis to pro- spective subscribers. A factor in his success as a southern editor was his close connection with the powerful National Intelligencer of Washing- ton, D. C. When Gales decided to move to North Carolina, he sold his Philadelphia newspaper to a brilliant young journalist, Samuel Harrison Smith, who in 1800 transferred it to Washington and renamed it the National Intelligencer, under which name it was destined to become the great newspaper at the national capital. In 1807 Joseph Gales, Jr., after graduating from the University of North Carolina, joined the National Intelligencer as reporter of Congressional debates. Later he acquired the newspaper in partnership with William Winston Seaton, 5William E. Dodd, Nathaniel Macon (Raleigh, 1903), 158. James M.

The policies followed by the Register proved popular among the dominant element of the state. Gales was, for example, a strong Union man during the nullification crisis, a movement which the responsible leaders of the state declined to support. The North Carolina editor had much in common with another significant journalist of the period, Hezekiah Niles of Baltimore, whose Niles' Weekly Register enjoyed a national patronage.' Like the Quaker editor, Gales was an ardent democrat and nationalist, a peace advocate, an opponent of dueling, and a champion of educating the people.'0 His interest in the economic development of Raleigh was shown by a petition which he sent to the United States Bank, urging the establishment of a branch bank. in Raleigh." In regard to slavery, he followed a moderate course. Al- though he was an antislavery man, he did not boldly attack the in- stitution as did the Quaker editor of the Greensborough Patriot, Wil- liam Swaim. In 1816 he was requested by some Quakers to publish an antislavery address which had been delivered before their Manumission Society. He replied in a frank letter: "I am not willing to insert it in the Register. It is on a subject which the people of the state will not hear discussed with temper at present, it might also produce conse- quences of a direful kind by getting into the hands of the Slaves, for many of them can read-I wish with you that an end could be put to Slavery but it will be of no use to attack the people's prejudices directly in the face, it must be brought about by slow, but gradual means.

In the intellectual history of the South Winifred and Joseph Gales are very significant as leaders of the Unitarian movement. After deism was extirpated from the South, a new element of liberalism was injected into the religious life of that section by the introduction of Unitarianism. The notable decline of this liberal sect in the South toward the end of the ante-bellum period is a valid index or barometer of the growing orthodoxy of the Old South. Of the four important figures in the south- ern penetration by the Unitarian church, Jared Sparks, Samuel Gilman, James Freeman Clark, and Joseph Gales, only the Raleigh editor was a layman. The other three were New England clergymen and Harvard men.14 The intellectual climate favorable to the growth of the Unitarian reli- gion had been prepared by the enlightenment of the eighteenth century and by the influence of Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson declared in a letter to Benjamin Waterhouse in 1822, "I trust that there is not a young man now living in the United States who will not die an Unitarian."'5 During the decades of the 1820's and 1830's there seemed to be a good prospect of establishing this rational religion among the upper class of the South. In 1817 the first important Unitarian society in the South was organized at Baltimore, and two years later Jared Sparks, recently graduated from Harvard, was ordained as the first regular pastor. At his ordination William Ellery Channing delivered a sermon that re- mained a classic statement of the doctrines of the Unitarian church in is African Repository and Colonial Journal (Washington, 1825-1892), IX (1834), 374-75; XII (1836), 190; XV (1839), 82. 14 Sparks is best known, of course, as a president of Harvard College and as an early editor of the writings of George Washington. Gilman composed the famous nostalgic song "Fair Harvard."

In order to propagandize the faith, Sparks founded in January, 1821, a monthly periodical, the Unitarian Miscellany, which lasted four years. The national House of Representatives paid a remarkable tribute to this Unitarian clergyman in December, 1821, by appointing him to serve as its chaplain."6 Winifred congratulated Sparks on re- ceiving this high honor, which she hailed as being a great triumph of liberal sentiment and of toleration.'7 Unitarian congregations were es- tablished during the decades of the 1820's and 1830's in at least ten of the principal cities of the South.'8 The Gales brought their Unitarian religion with them from England, where they had formed a friendship with Joseph Priestley. Besides being a great chemist, Priestley was a religious reformer, whose book, An His- tory of the Corruptions of Christianity, profoundly influenced Thomas Jefferson.'9 In Philadelphia the Gales renewed their friendship with the "virtuous, the pious, and the unassuming advocate of Truth, Dr. Priestley," who had also been driven from England.20 Joseph Gales was one of the organizers of the first Unitarian society in the Quaker City (1796), and he was the first lay reader of the group. Joseph Gales was also indirectly responsible for planting the first seeds of Unitarianism in Charleston, South Carolina. The founder of the Unitarian church in this center of southern culture was Anthony Forster of Brunswick County, North Carolina, who married a daughter of Winifred and Joseph Gales. Seeking to convert his father-in-law from his Unitarian views, Forster borrowed the books that had in- fluenced Gales, including Priestley's works. But, instead of being able to confute these unorthodox doctrines, he himself became a convert to Unitarianism.2' Boldly he began to preach in his Presbyterian church 16 Washington Daily National Intelligencer, 'December 11, 1821.

The Unitarian church at Charleston, located on Archdale Street, was not therefore an offshoot of New England Uni- tarianism, but an indigenous outgrowth.22 Forster died in 1820, and in announcing his death to Jared Sparks, Winifred spoke of the belief of the Gales in a life beyond the grave.23 Joseph Gales published the liberal sermons of his departed son-in-law. The Charleston congregation, after the resignation of Forster, invited Samuel Gilman, a young instructor at Harvard, to become their minister. In 1819 he was ordained by Jared Sparks, and his fine personality and ability made the Charleston society the most notable of the southern Unitarian churches. During his trip to the South, Sparks preached in the state capitol at Raleigh to a large audience including the governor and his family. As a result of this journey he declared that he was surprised "to find so much liberality of feeling among a people who have known nothing of the Unitarian principles." He also expressed his belief that "a Unitarian minister may preach in every state house in the Southern States."24 In 1821 Gilman came to Raleigh and preached to a congregation. Joseph Gales was delighted with the sermon of the Charleston minister and he noted the repercussions of this foray into orthodox territory. He wrote to Sparks that shortly after Gilman's visit a convention of Epis- copalians was held in Raleigh presided over by Bishop Richard C. Moore. "They could not overlook," he related, "the heretical doings which had just taken place here. Two sermons were directly leveled at us-one from the venerable Bishop himself. The Bishop went over the old beaten ground-ist of John's Gospel, 'The Father and I are one'."25 Winifred wrote a month later that the Presbyterian minister had not ceased since Gilman's sermon in Raleigh to declaim against 22 E.

Winifred described to Jared Sparks a Presbyte- rian convention in the city which she and her husband attended. "You will argue favorably," she wrote, "of the tolerant spirit of our Orthodox ministers and their tender forbearance towards their few erring but well- known friends at this place, that not a word was breathed to wound personal feelings or sectarian zeal nor one doxology sung during the four days which in successive weeks each sect occupied."" During these early days Joseph Gales was aiding the Unitarian cause in a quiet and diplomatic manner. He was securing subscribers in North Carolina to the Unitarian Miscellany of Baltimore, and later to the North American Review, which Jared Sparks was editing. He published a prospectus of the Unitarian Miscellany in the Register. He also printed some Unitarian pamphlets for distribution, especially on the subject of the supremacy of the one God and the subordination of his son, Jesus Christ. "I believe, indeed," he affirmed, "we have put a stop to the preaching of our Clergy on the subject, for, as we could not give them Sermon for Sermon (having no preacher) we published a Pam- phlet for every Sermon they preached."28 Gales also proposed to Sparks, as editor of the Unitarian Miscellany, that the latter turn over some of the overflow of his material for him to publish as extracts in the Raleigh Register. He observed: "And some of these Extracts, in which Unitarianism may not be prominent, may find their way into news- papers and other periodical works, and thus be read and approved of by many without suspecting they contain the favorite sentiments of the Sect which is every where spoken against; and Prejudice may in this way be undermined which could not be met directly-because liberal Books will not be read."29 The faith of Winifred Gales was a very enlightened and noble form of religion, resembling in many respects the religion of Thomas Jeffer- 26 Winifred Gales to Sparks, June 11, 1821, ibid. 27 Id. to id., May 2, 1822, ibid. 28 Joseph Gales to C.

She was unalterably opposed to shack- ling the consciences of men by a union of church and state, by making one sect, even the Unitarian faith, the established church.3' She read works on both sides of the main religious controversies of her day. She read, for example, the attacks made on "Dr. Priestley's just sentiment- that faith in a Trinity of three persons in one undivided Godhead could not certainly be more effectual in exciting devout sentiments than the doctrine of simple unity and that all the practical duties of religion were as secure on one hypothesis as the other." This pragmatic and rational attitude toward religion led her to ask: "Why do preachers of the meek doctrine of Christ not practise charity but throw the brands of discord? Why do they vilify that doctrine which bears the legitimate stamp of reason. That is not truth which will not bear discussion."32 She expressed a serene confidence that Unitarianism would gain ground in the United States as the result of the progress of education, but felt that its advance would be slow on account of "the morass of ignorance" among the people.33 The letters that Winifred Gales wrote to Jared Sparks are not only significant for the light they throw on religious conditions in the South, but they reveal a far different type of woman from the one portrayed in the romantic stereotype of the "Southern lady." Winifred was a success as a mother, rearing children who made a valuable contribution to society. Her letters are full of maternal solicitude for a wayward son, Weston R. Gales, who later succeeded his father as editor of the Raleigh Register. She sent him to Yale College instead of to Harvard, because of his language deficiency, and she wished to remove him from his wild companions at Raleigh where he idled away his time playing billiards and cards.34 Besides being a good mother, Winifred had time 30 See George H.

In her letters she quotes Pascal and Goldsmith, and refers to the writings of Thomas Paine. She her- self wrote a novel during her residence in North Carolina, entitled Mathilda Berkeley, or Family Anecdotes, which her husband published in 1804.35 But the most admirable facet of her versatile personality was her practice of tolerance. In one of her letters to Sparks she refers to the friendship of herself and her husband for Professor Benjamin Silli- man of Yale who differed from them decidedly in religion and politics. "Yet," she observed, "a good man is not less estimable, whatever Sec- tarian creed he adopt. Truth and Virtue are immutable-and names are but finite distinctions."36 In the letters there is not a trace of a crusading spirit for woman's rights, such as motivated her contemporar- ies, Sarah and Angelina Grimke of Charleston, South Carolina. The tolerant attitude of North Carolina toward Unitarians began to change in the middle of the 1820's. The state was influenced by the same orthodox spirit that caused Jefferson to abandon the fight to appoint the radical Thomas Cooper as professor in the newly created University of Virginia and drove Horace Holley, the Unitarian presi- dent of Transylvania University in Kentucky, from his position.37 In 1824 two New England Unitarian preachers, Jonathan Whitaker and his son, Daniel, came to Raleigh and were well received by the liberal element of the city. But the Presbyterian minister and a prominent Presbyterian deacon, Judge Henry Potter, tried to hamper their prose- lyting efforts by circulating letters damaging to their character. The Unitarians in Raleigh wrote to New England to ascertain the truth about the Whitakers, and received satisfactory replies which were pub- licly read. Joseph Gales believed that these men were being persecuted. To Sparks he wrote, "We have on the whole been well pleased with the preaching of these gentlemen-especially the young man. He had indeed raised up Unitarians at Fayetteville &amp; Cheraw [South Carolina], where, perhaps, an Unitarian Discourse was never before heard, and it 85 For an unfavorable criticism of this novel, see Archibald Henderson, North Carolina: The Old North State and the New, 2 vols.

They had as friends at the University of North Carolina, Profes- sor Nicholas Marcellus Hentz, an authority on spiders, and his talented wife, Caroline, who was actually making money writing plays and novels.4" This couple was free from narrow and bigoted views on reli- gion. Winifred wrote to Jared Sparks that Mrs. Hentz and her husband were not happy at Chapel Hill. "In respect to the male population, I fear there are some that were Servetus to revisit the earth, these rigid disciples of Calvin would-in the only way now sanctioned, for thank God the days of fire, faggot, and exile have passed away-persecute him after the most approved manner of dealing with Heretics."'" Two years later, the Gales, now an elderly couple, left their home in Raleigh to live with their son, Joseph Gales, Jr., the editor of the National Intelligence. One of the reasons assigned for this change of residence by Winifred was: "3rdly, though not least, the privilege and happiness we hope to enjoy of worshipping our heavenly Father in the manner which long-imbibed truths have impressed upon our minds."42 But the old reformer, accompanied by his wife, came back to Raleigh to die in the year 1841. The type of liberalism that the Gales lived may properly be called Jeffersonian." It did not generate an intolerance of points of view different from their own, such as the conservative attitude toward revealed religion. They tried to see all sides of a question and avoid 38 Joseph Gales to Sparks, June 12, 1824, Gales Papers. 89 Dictionary of American Biography, XX, 80-81. 40 Ibid., VIII, 565-66; Edwin A.

But this respect for the opinions of others did not imply lack of strong convic- tions. For over a quarter of a century they made intelligent efforts to advance the Unitarian religion in the South. But they fought for a losing cause. Most of the promising Unitarian churches that existed in the South during the decades of the 1820's and 1830's either disap- peared or were in a moribund condition on the eve of the Civil War." The Unitarians had long struggled in vain to convince southern people that they were entitled to the name of Christians, but they were regarded by the multitude as infidels. The main support of the church continued to be sporadic colonies of New Englanders located in the South. The fact that the Unitarian ministers in the North became strong antislavery men discredited the church in the eyes of most Southerners. Further- more, the Unitarian religion, suited to intellectual aristocrats, was not adapted to the emotional needs of the rural folk of the South. It was too cold and intellectual a religion, lacking in color and emotional appeal, to compete with the hymn-singing Methodists, and the various orthodox sects that emphasized an anthropomorphic conception of reli- gion that the common man could understand. While the experiences of Winifred and Joseph Gales present a good illustration of the spirit of tolerance in North Carolina during the first quarter of the nineteenth century, theirs should not be considered as an isolated case. During the same period, for example, the career of Judge William Gaston, a Catholic in an overwhelmingly Protestant state, demonstrated that lack of orthodoxy and the active championing of the rights of minorities did not prevent political preferment. Gaston's fight for the modification of the religious requirements for holding office in North Carolina; his efforts in behalf of political rights for manumitted slaves; and his advocacy of emancipation definitely marked him as a southern liberal; and yet he served in the state legislature or in Congress almost continuously from 1800 to 1832, and as one of the three judges 44 In 1860 the South contained only three Unitarian societies and only twenty-four of the six hundred and sixty-four Universalist churches of the country.

All three were well-balanced individuals who recognized the rights of others to hold opinions which differed from theirs and who sought merely to preserve similar rights for themselves and for other minority groups. Gales, for example, was especially noted for his "temperateness of mind" and his "unvarying moderation"4 at the very time when he was advocating in his newspaper such progressive reforms as a state penitentiary, an insane asylum, a school for the deaf, internal improvements, and the encour- agement of southern manufactures.47 Yet even the most enlightened men are not uniformly liberal, and young liberals frequently become conservative as they grow older. It is interesting to note that in national politics neither Gales nor Gaston was able to see beneath the tumult and violent partisanship of the Jacksonian movement to its significance as a genuinely democratic advance. Gales supported William H. Crawford for President in 1824, and John Quincy Adams in 1828, in preference to Andrew Jackson. Gaston lamented in 1832: "If our united Republic should last so long as to render its history worthy of preservation the period of Gen'l Jackson's rule will be commemorated as its dark age. The delusion, party spirit, and corruption which are banded together in support of the weak and violent idol of the day, can not I fear be resisted success- fully."48 Liberalism and realistic democracy, although they have much 45 Two excellent studies of Gaston's career are: Joseph H.

But this liberality of thought as reflected by the Gales and Gaston in North Carolina in the first quarter of the nineteenth century was not an isolated phenomenon in the South. The region as a whole seems to have gone through a liberal cycle of its history during this same period. This phase of Kentucky history, for example, has been designated as "Liberal Kentucky" by a student of the cultural history of the South, who has analyzed the bases of this liberalism as a separation of church and state and of church and college, the exclusion of the clergy from politics, the emphasis on morality rather than theology, and on physi- ology rather than spirit in the interpretation of human nature.49 It is a striking fact that James Garrard, the popular governor of Kentucky from 1796 to 1804, was an avowed Unitarian.'50 In Virginia, the establishment of the University of Virginia (1825) on the principles of the illimitable freedom of the human mind marks a high point in south- ern idealism. In South Carolina, the great free thinker, Dr. Thomas Cooper, was able to maintain his position as president of the state uni- versity from 1820 until 1835 despite the attacks of intolerant religious groups.5' But religious conservatism closely follows economic conserv- atism, and a great change toward religious orthodoxy was soon to take place in the South as that section began to regiment thought within its borders to protect powerful vested interests that were threatened by the liberal forces of the period. 49 See Niels H.
