<plain_text><page sequence="1">Hermes, Clio, Themis: Historical Interpretation and Legal Hermeneutics Donald R. Kelley University of Rochester The theory of interpretation has enjoyed a considerable revival of interest in recent years, especially in relation to historical methods. 1 Intellectual fashion aside, the main attraction of hermeneutics seems to be its promise of alternatives to intimidating behaviorist, quantitative, or abstract- structuralist approaches to the human sciences. In the pandemonium of "scientific" methods for the study of society and culture the one common feature has been the attempt in one way or another to do away with the thinking subject. In the name of scientific objectivity, psychoanalysts and Marxists have likewise looked for impersonal forces below, or beyond, the level of consciousness; functionalists and structuralists have sought patterns, or codes, which likewise transcend, or subsume, human behavior; "deconstructionist" literary critics have subordinated authorial intention and consciousness to the medium of discourse, whether language or "writing"; and "new" economic and social historians have cast their explanations in statistical and serial terms which make personality, quality, and perhaps values irrelevant. Each of these lines of inquiry undeniably has value and its own insights, but each is also threatened by some sort of reductionism, and none can tell the whole truth. In particular each tends to neglect, or to misconstrue, the role of the observer, which is to say the interpreter, usually by affecting to replace judgment by a technique. Now despite Kierkegaard's urging, subjectivity may not be truth, but neither is technique. What hermeneutics proposes is to accommodate 1 Besides translations of the works of Gadamer, Habermas, and Ricoeur, recent studies include Karl-Otto Apel, Transformation der Philosophie (Frankfurt, 1973); Zygmunt Bauman, Hermeneutics and Social Science (New York, 1978); Joseph Bleicher, Contemporary Hermeneutics (London, 1980), and The Hermeneutical Imagination (London, 1982); David Hoy, The Critical Circle (Berkeley, 1978); Erwin Hufnagel, Einfiihrung in die Hermeneutik (Stuttgart, 1976); T.

"Interpretation" is pre- if not nonscientific, as old as literature, older than philosophy; and the theory of interpretation goes almost as far back. Indeed its origins are mythical, hermeneia being associated with the messenger-god Hermes and with the priests of the Delphic oracle, hence with the process of divination. From the beginning the aim of interpretation was to give human expression to superhuman, or general, truth; and philosophically, from Aristotle's Peri Hermenias, it was regarded as the primary function of the intellect, that is, the formulation of statements preliminary to logical reasoning. But almost from the beginning, too, there was interest in finding the general "meaning" of human creations, especially written creations: there was, in other words, a philological as well as a philosophical hermeneutics, starting especially with criticism of the Homeric poems. Here was the first major encounter between Hermes and Clio; and their offspring, the science of philology, played an important part in the development of historical method, although the philosophical and theological varieties of hermeneutics have in large measure come to overshadow their literary cousin. The classic historical survey remains Wilhelm Dilthey's Entstehung der Hermeneutik, which treats its subject as a cornerstone of the human sciences as well as a major dimension of Western history and indeed as an aspect of that "critique of historical reason" which was Dilthey's life task.2 In Judaeo-Christian tradition, book-bound as it has been, herme- neutics has played a crucial and indeed shaping role. Talmudists and Christian exegetes alike expounded and explicated God's word as expressed in scriptures, and then extended their interpretations into larger earthly and heavenly domains. In the most elementary sense "interpretation" meant literary translation; and as biblical practitioners of this art from Jerome to Erasmus learned, it was a most demanding and even dangerous occupation: what man could presume to give human expression to the diving Logos? Fortunately, there was a hermeneutical dispensation. The old rule that "the letter killeth while the spirit giveth life" licensed not only translators but also more creative patristic and scholastic readers of the "sacred page."3 The climax of medieval hermeneutics came with 2 Gesammelte Schriften 5 (Munich, 1927): 334 ff.; and cf.

History, allegory, tropology, and morality were the four conventional rubrics of the literal and various figurative modes of interpretration which allowed pious men to uncover the different levels of scripture, defined by Hugh of St. Victor as "the letter, the sense and the deeper meaning."4 Despite protests of fidelity to texts -Latin sensus historicus, fides historiae; Greek kyrios; Hebrew peshat-biblical hermeneutics developed into a complex "sacred science," a discipline which, by the Middle Ages, admitted the critical subject as well as the divine object into its domain. Renaissance humanism at once broadened and simplified the theory of interpretation: broadened it by introducing notions of style, cultural con- text, anachronism, and a varity of critical tools; simplified it by insisting on the "historical sense" and discarding the conventions and apparatus of figurative interpretation. "Grammarians" like Lorenzo Valla and Erasmus had as little use for the etymological speculations of Isidore of Seville and allegorizing fantasies of the Victorines as they did for the metaphysical fictions of the scholastics; and they rejected all on the same grounds, that is, the metahistorical and metalinguistic character of such interpretation. The classic humanist treatment was Leonardo Bruni's De interpretatione recta, which inquired into the conceptual resources of Latin and the propriety of translating authors like Aristotle.5 For Bruni the interpreter's basic skill was not philosophical depth, however, it was literary expertise and mastery of ancient authorities; and this scholarly requirement was even more essential for more complex interpretation, such as Valla's pioneering "higher criticism" of the New Testament and the conjectural emendations and "restitutions" made by classicists like Angelo Poliziano and Ermolao Barbaro. It was in the sixteenth century, however, that hermeneutics emerged in a recognizably modern form. The philological "science" established by Bruni and Valla and developed by Poliziano, Bude, and Erasmus was perfected by the great generation of "critics," including Casaubon, Lipsius, and above all, the young Scaliger.6 More famously, perhaps, this age of religious reform saw the emergence of the Protestant school of biblical criticism, which has conventionally been regarded as the point of departure of modern hermeneutics as formulated by Schleiermacher, extended to the world of human culture by Dilthey, and developed by such followers 4Didascalion, trans.

In particular Flacius Illyricus, reacting to the definitions of Christian "tradition" set by the Council of Trent, had devised a "key" to scriptural criticism based on a combination of Ren- aissance philology and the Lutheran approach to biblical interpretation (which, though also devoted to the "historical sense," was by no means the simplistic fundamentalism some have misjudged it to be).7 In the eighteenth century another stage was reached when G. F. Meier expanded theological hermeneutics into what (in 1757) he called "The Idea of a General Theory of Interpretation," while in the nineteenth century biblical scholars like Strauss extended their interpretations into the broader fields of mythology and cultural history.8 From Dilthey's time this complex of intellectual traditions, chronicled with reverent detail in Joachim Wach's Das Verstehen, has broadened into a wide range of human sciences; and despite positivist resistance, its offshoots still thrive as special forms of "critical" philosophy. Through the partnership between Clio and Hermes the "thinking subject," homo interpres as he might be called, still lives; and so does hermeneutics.9 II Yet if hermeneutics lives, indeed is enjoying a revival, it is not beyond reproach even by its admirers. Two basic criticisms may be suggested (not including the misguided charge of subjectivism), and they correspond neatly to the polarity evident in the theory of interpretation from its Greek beginnings. On the one hand there is the tendency of philological hermeneutics toward hypostasis and idolatry of the written text: Alex- andrine grammatikoi do not look beyond Homer even when Homer nods; and Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, and other textualists have likewise, if more self-consciously, inclined to a fetishism of the printed page, a fixation on the "text-model." There are no doubt grounds on which such attitudes can be justified, and it is difficult to resist Paul Ricoeur's ar- guments for the "semantic autonomy of the text," if not for its exclusive identification with the "hermeneutical field." 10 The question here, how- ever, is not the conceptual plausibility of textualism even in its extreme 7See Wilhelm Preger, Matthias Flacius Illyricus und seine Zeit (1859-61), 2: 478 ff. 8Die Idee einer allgemeinen Auslegungslehre, based on lectures at the University of Halle; and for the historical background of the "higher" criticism, David Friedrich Strauss, The Life of Jesus Critically Examined, 2nd ed., trans.

Worth, Texas, 1976), p. 29.</page><page sequence="5">648 Kelley Derridean forms, but rather its methodological value for historical in- vestigation and interpretation. A similar reservation must be made about the philosophical school, which from Aristotle to Gadamer inclined toward what E. D. Hirsch deprecates as "metaphysical hermeneutics" or what Ricoeur characterizes more favorably as a shift "from epistemology to ontology," whether the surrogate text is secular or religious, phenomenal or noumenal." In the "transformation of philosophy" pursued by German philosophers the key is also the fundamental "linguisticality" of the human condition; and again we seem to be confronted by an up-to-date version of the Baconian idols of the den, or perhaps the Vichian conceit of scholars. If for French devotees of 1' ecriture the book is seen as a world, for German defenders of Sprachlichkeit the world appears as a book; and neither metaphor, generative of so much scholastic debate, seems adequate for historical understanding. The fallacy of the first is the uncritical elevation of the subject above the object of interpretation, that of the second an existential, perhaps irreversible, leap into phenomenology. Perhaps from an aversion to old-fashioned "historicist" attitudes, both seem to have lost Dilthey's vision of a unifying and fructifying science of humanity, one by a literary ploy amounting to a sort of higher fundamentalism, the other by philosophical circumvention which in effect smuggles herme- neutics into metaphysical speculation. For the historian neither will do. With the language model itself there are certain difficulties and diverting assumptions. "History is, as it were, the great dark book," Gadamer has written, "the collected work of the human spirit, written in the language of the past, the text of which we have to understand."'12 But let us not forget the "as it were," for the historical process is not merely a silent clamor of "intersubjective" thought. Much of its substance-actions, interactions, institutions, social patterns-may well escape the net of interpretive systems which bind themselves to conscious thought and expression, and so fall into the idealist fallacy expressed most famously in the Croce-Collingwood proposition that "all history is the history of thought" and preserved in the "existential subjectivity" of Gadamer. This would seem enough in itself to discredit the thinking subject, and indeed it has been the basis of one of the major complaints registered by positivist and behaviorist critics. It is a view which has implications 11 Hirsch, The Aims of Interpretation (Chicago, 1976), p. 85, and Paul Ricoeur, Hermeneutics and the Human Sciences, trans. J. Thompson (Cambridge, 1981), p. 53. 12 Truth and Method, trans. G. Barden and J. Cumming (New York, 1975), p. 156.

The point is that the "hermeneutical field" must accommodate not only the thinking subject and his medium but also the objects of his attention, which indeed serve to establish and to define his subjectivity. The world of "things," however remote and impenetrable in an ontological sense, needs to be accommodated as sphere of potential experience beyond the horizons of perception-an extension of the hermeneutical field to be explored and analyzed, perhaps civilized and socialized. A common failing of both philological and philosophical hermeneutics has been the general neglect of social and historical context. Gadamer's conviction that "Being that can be understood is language" 13 does not seem adequate to the problem of gaining access to the dimension of inarticulate human action, individual or collective, rational or irrational. Such indeed is the implication of the critique of Gadamer offered by Habermas, who has tried to provide remedies by attending (in Marxist or at least Marxoid fashion) to problems of ideology, to action theory and to "social sys- tems."14 Gadamer rejects this as in effect a reversion to dualism, while at the same time acknowledging the force of Habermas's concerns. How then can we overcome the subject-object paradox (which may itself be inherent in Sprachlichkeit) and at the same time accommodate the process of history without succumbing to reductionism, economic or political, or to the fallacies of "value-free" social science? Gadamer's answer is most provocative, though not systematically followed up. "Legal her- meneutics," he has declared, "is able to point out what the real procedure of the human sciences is." This is the suggestion which, from a historical 13 Philosophical Hermeneutics, trans. D. Linge (Berkeley, 1976), p. 31. It should be understood that the present critique is limited to questions of historical investigation and interpretation and does not confront the problem of Heideggerian "4prejudice," which would in effect deny the possibility of historical understanding beyond our present Kulturkreis. This sort of epistemological relativism (which itself can be seen "historically" as well as logically and ontologically) is useful in suggesting the philosophical limits of historical knowledge and may even in effect reduce it, strictly speaking, to a form of imagination; but it can hardly be allowed to interfere with historical or anthropological inquiry; and indeed the aim of Gadamer, Ricoeur, et al. is precisely to salvage the philosophical standing of the human sciences. 14 See Thomas McCarthy, The Critical Theory of Jiirgen Habermas (Cambridge, Mass., 1981), p. 187, and Bleicher, Contemporary Hermeneutics, p. 153; also Martin Jay, "Should Intellectual History Take a Linguistic Turn?

III Unlike the long-standing relationship which Hermes has maintained with Clio, that with Themis, goddess of justice and social order, has hardly been noticed, except within professional legal scholarship-and that in- tellectual tradition has been largely cut off from the human sciences and even philosophy in the past century or more. This is a curious and la- mentable circumstance, for legal hermeneutics has a history almost as long and colorful as those of the theological, philosophical, and literary varieties. What is more, it has enjoyed some of the same harvest times, most notably in medieval commentaries on civil law (corresponding to biblical exegesis), in Renaissance treatises on the ars critica in law, and in romantic theories of interpretation parallel (as well as contemporary) with those of Schleiermacher and Friedrich Ast. It has not, however, enjoyed a comparable revival, or historical appreciation, in the present century. 16 Preoccupied with Schleiermacher, his Vorldufer and his epi- gones, Dilthey did not even deign to mention the almost congruent legal tradition, nor is it touched on in the authoritative survey of Wach or later sketches known to me. Even Emilio Betti, though the law furnished his own intellectual provenance and though he touches on the subject (in- terpretazione giuridica; juristische Auslegung) says virtually nothing about the historical background. 17 The starting point for such an inquiry must be Roman jurisprudence, although the debts to Greek philosophy and rhetoric were extensive and should not be forgotten. The pretension of Roman law to the status of true "science" and beyond that the highest form of human wisdom (sapi- entia as well as scientia) was based on two arguments: one that law was rational and universal, explicable in terms of "causes" and in accord with nature; the other that it took into account human values and social 16 There is extensive literature on legal hermeneutics beginning especially with Savigny (see below, n. 25), but little carries over into historical or social thought.

It rep- resented, in other words, both theoria and praxis. The great tradition of expertise in "legal science" began, as Max Weber has argued, with the empirical and theoretical masters called honoratiores, whose business was both to judge social reality (the facts of a case or, as legal reformers, the condition of a society) and to apply the reason of the law according to established method, eventually to contribute also to the analysis, con- ceptualization, and systemization of the law. 18 These professional scholars were at once practitioners (prudentes), scientists, and "priests of the law," but they were above all interpreters (juris interpretes), whose base was not only the accumulated (and accumulating) experience of civil law and the "law of nations" (jus gentium) but also the ill-defined concept of natural law. The legal hermeneutics developed by these forefathers of social science from at least the second century B.C. was the life principle of Roman, Romanist, and Romanoid jurisprudence for two millenia and more. The great landmark in the history of Roman legal science is the work of legal codification carried out in the sixth century by the Emperor Justinian and his Byzantine editors, who tried to sum up and to systematize more than ten centuries of legal experience and interpretation. One of the premises of this effort was the hope of the Emperor that his law should "prevail forever, " and one corollary was the ban he placed on all "interpretation" whatsoever.19 But to avoid what Justinian himself called "the vain discord of posterity" was an illusion, not only because of the instability of the human condition but also because of the demise of imperial authority in general. Beginning with the twelfth century revival of civil law, legal hermeneutics found new life and, through the ambitions and controversies of medieval juris interpretes, an astonishingly active career. For scholastic jurisprudence, "interpretation" was essential not only to discover the meaning or "spirit of the law" (mens legum, ratio legis) but also to give applicability to modern society and even to reform and to "correct" laws; and it did not hesitate to treat questions of political 18 On Law and Society, trans.

In the course of such discussions there emerged practical awareness both to problems of subjectivity and to the necessity of making judgments in terms of times, places, circumstances, and persons: the science of law had also, in short, psychological, epistemological, and sociological dimensions.20 The first great age of modern legal (as of theological) hermeneutics was the sixteenth century. In connection with the widespread search for a proper scientific "method" in various disciplines, legal scholars also began to produce treatises on legal methodology and then specifically on the theory of interpretation (De interpretatione legis and De exten- sionibus being the conventional ways of defining the subject).2' These discussions were informed not only by the issues of scholastic jurisprudence but also by the historical and literary insights of humanist scholars- "grammarians" who approached the legal canon of Justinian, as they approached holy scriptures, as human documents. As Erasmus interpreted the Bible in the light of philology, so his younger friend Andrea Alciato introduced similar critical methods into the study of civil law. This was the age, too, of the great methodological conflict between "legal hu- manism" and the old-fashioned scholastic jurisprudence, reflected most famously in Alberico Gentili's dialogue of 1582 but more profoundly in contemporary treatises devoted to the problem of legal systematics and its relation to history and philology.22 This polemical and "scientific" 20 More detailed treatment in my articles, "Vera Philosophia: the Philosophical Significance of Renaissance Jurisprudence," Journal of the History of Philosophy 14 (1976): 267-79; "Civil Science in the Renaissance: Jurisprudence Italian Style," The Historical Journal 22 (1979): 777-94; and "Civil Science in the Renaissance: Jurisprudence in the French Manner," History of European Ideas 2 (1981): 261 -76.

It is worth noting, too, that the collateral descendant of Roman juris- prudence (that is, canon law) likewise, congruently and dependently, developed a theory of interpretation which was even more "extensive" and socially conscious than that of the civilians.23 For in their efforts to give social meaning to laws canonists attended not only to doctrinal tradition and professional convention (the communis opinio which might also reflect tacit consent) but also to the variables and unpredictables of the human condition-time, place, social condition, and circum- stances -basic to what from the twelfth century has been called "positive law." Canonists have had their own peculiarly flexible standards of judg- ment (aequitas canonica) because of their special need to join public and private spheres, and as a result they have had recourse to various interpretive strategies -exceptions, privileges, dispensations -in order to "relax" abstract laws and accommodate them to society as well as to transcendent demands. Most characteristic of all was the canonist technique of "harmonizing interpretation," which was consummated in Gratian's great collection originally entitled "Concord of Discordant Canons" and subject to the same sort of interpretive glosses and commentaries as Justinian's secular canon. It is significant that canonist interpretation came to maturity at just the time of that religious "Reformation" which, besides challenging canonist tradition, formed the context of that seminal phase of modern hermeneutics described by Dilthey. Since the "golden age" of legal science in the sixteenth century there has been a fairly continuous tradition, or set of traditions, of interpretation theory down to modern times. For theology Dilthey has located some of the major figures between Flacius and Schleiermacher, but for juris- prudence the trail remains largely unexplored, as has the stage since the early nineteenth century. The rise of "historicism," which produced the "higher criticism" of the Bible, gave impetus likewise to controversies over that reincarnation of civil law which was the Code Napoleon of 1804. Like his prototype Justinian, the French emperor tried to forbid 23 Important discussions by Charles Lefebvre, Les pouvoirs du juge en droit canonique (Paris, 1931); J.

" as Savigny phrased the question, and "What is the relation of what is now to what will be ?" The effect of the historical school under Savigny's leadership was not only to reinforce ties between historical and legal scholarship but to introduce hermeneutics into the partnership.26 This new trinity of Hermes, Clio, and Themis was involved, at some points collectively, in efforts of considerable importance for the human sciences. Until fairly recently the achievements of this partnership have been limited mostly to historical scholarship and to the professional domain. On the one hand we have seen the proliferating offspring of the historisches Rechtschule in the form of investigations of legal, institutional, and certain kinds of social history; on the other hand the endless and divergent debates of jurists over the value of historicism, positivism, formalism, naturalism, and various sorts of socialism (not only Communist law but also droit social and Rechtssoziologie, which is also heavily endebted to Savigny). Less significant has been the theoretical contribution of specifically legal hermeneutics to history and the human sciences, though Weberian sociology certainly owes much to legal categories (Weber himself having been trained in the law) and Gadamer has touched upon "the exemplary significance of legal hermeneutics."27 Only one philosopher has tried comprehensively to follow up this insight, however; and this is Gadamer's most searching critic, Emilio Betti, a man who has himself been a major figure in contemporary hermeneutics, though little appreciated 24 Code Civil, art. 5, discussion in P.

Since Betti came to hermeneutics from jurisprudence, bringing with him essential juridical ideas and insights, he is ideally suited to appear here as the principal witness for the defense of the partnership of Hermes, Clio, and Themis. IV Betti was a center of professional controversy from at least 1927, when he published his Milanese inaugural lecture on Roman law and contem- porary legal doctrines.28 Ostensibly, his aim was to restore the normative value of Roman law (and in this sense, perhaps, to "return to Savigny"); but more importantly his hope was to restore the "autonomy" and neutrality of jurisprudence in a period when it was being threatened by the positivism of jurists like P. De Francisci and especially by the political priorities of Fascism. In this period of a "crisis" both of historicism and of jurisprudence29 Betti wanted to reconcile historical tradition and legal system (storia and dogma) in much the same way that Savigny had tried to distill his historical reconstruction of the Roman tradition into an up- to-date "Pandectist" system intended to form the basis for a German Code. In another sense, however, Betti was pursuing, in the crucible of Fascist experience, the age-old goal of reconciling the ideals of justice with social reality, and especially with the intrusions of political power. It was a losing battle for the most part, but it did prepare him for a larger intellectual effort. Betti's transition to philosophy after the war represents a sort of expansion, or sublimation, of his original professional and "technical" goal, culminating in his monumental treatise, published in German as well as in Italian, on "the general theory of interpretation. "30 It was via legal hermeneutics, then, that Betti passed from Crocean "idealist historicism" to a more concrete and differentiated (though non- 28 "Diritto romano e dogmatica odierno," Archivio giuridico 99 (1928): 26- 66; and see the articles of Antonio de Gennaro and Pietro Costa in Quaderni Fiorentini per la storia del pensiero giuridico moderno 7 (1978): "Emilio Betti e la scienza giuridica del Novecento," pp. 79-111, and pp. 311-93. 29 See especially Karl Heussi, Die Krisis des Historismus (Tuibingen, 1932). 30 Betti's treatise is cited from both Italian and German versions, Teoria della interpretazione (Milan, 1955), and Allgemeine Auslegungslehre als Methodik der Geisteswissenschaften (Tiubingen, 1967).

The encyclopedic range of Betti's work opens up a richer historical perspective (as well as philosophical range) than the orthodox tradition. In significant contrast, too, with the existential and phenomenological concerns of Gadamer (and the "ideo- logical" concerns of Habermas) Betti's purpose was to return to the tradition of the human sciences and to the enterprises of philosophers like Dilthey, Cassirer, Erich Rothaker, and Michael Landmann. What is more, Betti's approach was methodological and in this sense prescriptive, being directed (as Gadamer himself acknowledged) to the quaestio juris and not merely the quaestiofacti of interpretation, which is to say to the possibilities rather than the limits of hermeneutics.31 This may be the main reason, too, that Betti refused to be bound by either the text-model or even the privileged position of language. Be-tti's point of departure was epistemology (gnoseologia; Erkennt- nistheorie)-the relation of the thinking subject (soggetto pensante; den- kende Subjekt or subjectives Bewusstsein) to a world inferrable through experience, yet identified not with the Kantian Ding an sich but rather with an "ideal objectivity" inseparable from subjective judgment. He joined subject and object in a single dialectical process mediated by hermeneutical constructs he called "representative" or "meaning-full forms," through which meaning is communicated and preserved, according to Betti's famous four canons of interpretation which define the whole continuum of understanding.32 Here the legal connection is clear. Jurists were always supposed to respect the "meaning" of laws, the mens in the sense of will or intention of the original lawgiver; and to a large extent Betti preserved this professional "intentionalism." We may be the ones who pose questions of a text, but this text has a will of its own and literally "talks back" to the interpreter (or judge). As Betti put it, "We must assume that the text has something to say which we do not know from ourselves and which exists independently of our act of un- derstanding."33 This is what Betti meant by his first canon, which asserts "the hermeneutical autonomy of the subject." Whence Betti's motto, Sensus non est inferendus sed efferendus: meanings are not to be imputed to objects of analysis but derived from 31 See Bleicher, Contemporary Hermeneutics, p. 146. 32 Teoria, p. 19, and Auslegungslehre, p. 16.

Jurists had to establish the "facts" of a case, and necessarily such facts had to be given legal, which is to say social, meaning in order to be subjected to categorical or equitable judgment on the basis of legal principle. Similarly, the nonverbal materials of the historical process had to be given meaning through selection and interpretation. Like Habermas, in other words, though in a more integral fashion, Betti tried to confront problems of social context, historical tradition, and implicitly ideology. Beyond "philological," "critical," and "psychological" moments of exegesis in which an interpreter tried to recreate a cultural object or pattern there is also what Betti calls a "technical-morphological moment," which seeks particular structural meanings defined in relation to other fields, including economic and social action.35 Gadamer would have none of this; but though he might seem to have the best of this debate in philosophical terms, Betti's broader, more encyclopedic (and more eclectic) vision seems better suited to the needs of historical understanding. Historical interpretation is not simply a matter of apprehension and formal judgment, of course; it has also to take into account human volition and values, those of the interpreter as well as the object of study. Inter- pretation is itself a social process, in other words, depending on a species of "good faith" (bona fides) and carried out in a "world of values" (cosmos di valori; Kosmos der Werte ) in which value judgments (giudizia di valori; Werturteil) were unavoidable.36 Again the mediating position of the jurist suggests a model, since judgments had to involve not only original intention but also rationality and social values, such as equity or public utility. Historical judgment is not normative in this direct sense; and yet historical interpretation does have its own standards of larger meaning, which depend on the norms and direction of (professional) historical inquiry. Historians, too, must work within a "meaning system," not only to pass judgment but also to formulate meaningful questions. For the epistemological, sociological, and anthropological requirements of history and the human sciences jurisprudence offered benefits which 34 Teoria, p. 100; Auslegungslehre, p. 65. 35 Teoria, p. 291; Auslegungslehre, p. 204. 36 Teoria, p. 1 1; Auslegungslehre, p. 10.</page><page sequence="15">658 Kelley were wholly lacking in what Betti called the "mathematical" and "me- chanical" (automatica) "surrogates" of naturalism. 37 In general, it seems to me, the significance of Betti's work for the study of history is that it addresses itself precisely to the problem of how to accommodate the scholarly inquirer as well as the object of inquiry in discussions of "method" and "truth," and that it posits an object of interpretation(oggettivazione della spirito in unaforma representativa; Objektionen des Geistes der sinnhaltigen Formen) in terms of a multiplicity of texts and testimonies. What he took from the law in particular was its "gnoseological" and "axiological" orientation-that is, its concerns with the problems of knowing and judging, of human will (conscious and, implicitly, unconscious), aspirations and values in a context of structured social "reality." What he discarded was its formalism and professional estrangement from the human sciences in Dilthey's sense. Betti stands in somewhat the same relation to the tradition of legal her- meneutics as do Gadamer, Habermas, and perhaps Ricoeur to the theo- logico-philosophical tradition. V What does the legal model of hermeneutics have to offer to the study of history'? I have suggested that it is superior to, or at least historically richer than, the more familiar philological, philosophical, and theological varieties because it is concerned more directly with social reality, human actions, and collectivities. Like "general" hermeneutics, the legal theory of interpretation further offers an alternative to conceptions of history which look to, or lust after, scientific models of one sort or another, especially Betti's "mathematical surrogate." This point is intended not to revive the old quarrel between "historicism" and "naturalism" (in the words of Ernst Troeltsch, characterizing the famous distinction made by Wilhelm Windelband and Heinrich Rickert between Kultur- and Na- turwissenschaften) but only to avoid the naive fallacies about "objectivity" and "value-free" social science generated in particular by the Wertur- teilsdiskussion opened by Max Weber in 1914.38 At the very least her- meneutics offers an alternative to this blind alley. Hermeneutics does not presume to ban investigations based on quantitative or behavioral assumptions but only to insist that the meanings attributed to such research are themselves the products of culturally conditioned human effort. Hermeneutics has implications for the "philosophy of history" in both of the forms it has tended to assume in recent years the "analytical" 37 Teoria, p. 180; Auslegungslehre, p. 120. 38 Survey of these problems in Pietro Rossi, Lo storicismo tedesco contemporaneo (Turin, 1956).</page><page sequence="16">Historical Interpretation and Legal Hermeneutics 659 and the "speculative" or (as Arthur Danto calls it) "substantive."39 Despite a long and distinguished heritage reaching from Toynbee and Spengler through Hegel back to Otto of Freising and Augustine himself, the speculative philosophy of history seems to have fallen on bad times, despite noble efforts by Peter Munz, Haskell Fain, and others to seek "the whole truth about history."40 Emerging from theology and myth, this genre seems bound to return to its source, at least in its conventional universal (i.e., Judaeo-Christian) form. This is the classic sort of "me- tahistory" and has ties as well with the classical tradition of hermeneutics. Explicitly or implicitly, it is also tied to beliefs about prehistory, especially myth, and posthistory, especially prophecy. It is hard for critical historians nowadays to take seriously such neo-Augustinian efforts to find the "grand design," whether of God or a mindless, material "law." Yet it may be equally foolish for historians to pretend that they do not operate in effect from metahistorical assumptions, at the very least from those present in language; and one might wonder about the advisability of devoting some critical effort to deciding about some of the larger meaning of history from our perspective. Not to do so may condemn us to the pre- dicament ascribed by Whitehead to those who affect to have no meta- physical presumptions -which is to be disadvantaged by the instinctive metaphysics of the nursery. Legal hermeneutics has long grappled with the questio-n of the need of a large conceptual framework in order to achieve validity and consistency in judgment and interpretation, and the analogy may well hold for historical studies as well. The "analytical philosophy of history" is something else again. Although it has been represented as a reaction to idealism (especially that of pre- 1914 Germany) and uncritical speculative philosophy, it is historically as old as F. H. Bradley's Presuppositions of Critical History (1874). Obviously, this "critical" approach had little to do with that of neo- Kantian philosophers like Rickert or Dilthey; it intended, and portended, a recourse to logic and naturalism as a way of making history "scientific" beyond the dreams of Ranke or even J. B. Bury. As a consequence, especially in the past generation or two, the theory of history has been' dominated by a new scholasticism whose stock in trade includes pre- scriptive talk about "holism," "covering laws," action theory, the most naively positivistic notions of research (as "data-gathering"), and the 39 Arthur C. Danto, Analytical Philosophy of History (Cambridge, Mass., 1965). As in the case of hermeneutics this brief critique is offered from the point of view not of philosophy but of historical method and interpretation. 40 Fain, Between Philosophy and History (Princeton, N.J., 1970), and Munz, The Shapes of Time (Middletown, Conn., 1978), the most leamed and provocative of recent contributions.</page><page sequence="17">660 Kelley most rigid insistence of the primacy of "explanation" in history.41 Mar- ginally, this literature, which has gained the status of a professional specialty, may have a cleansing effect; but mostly it has been irrelevant because of its tendency to focus on explanatory logic to the exclusion of concrete understanding-to empty form of its content, except as para- digmatic cases (and even then the cracking of a radiator or an automobile accident is often preferred to even a generic historical "event" like a war or a revolution). In such arid discussions one would like to recommend Clifford Geertz's arguments for "thick description" and that sort of evidence jurists would call circumstantial.42 The spectre haunting these discussions is that of causal analysis -and lurking behind, perhaps, that minor offspring of La Place's Demon, the "covering law." Here submission to a scientific model is most complete- and seems most inappropriate. No one has shown this more convincingly than the analytical philosophers themselves, notably Karl Popper, who has argued that the purpose and indeed the premise, of causal analysis is prediction. The historical counterpart of this operation can only be (as Isaiah Berlin and Paul Veyne have pointed out) "retrodiction," a process which has little utility and less verifiability.43 Or rather, it introduces a serious misconception of historical understanding, representing another example of the "tendency among tough-minded philosophers," noted by Leon Goldstein, "to assimilate knowing the historical past to knowing the natural present."44 The point is not that causal analysis is not useful for special lines of inquiry, only that it does not suffice for many interpretive and synthetic purposes and that it may often be illusory-a mockery of scientific procedure. As Berlin has pointed out, strategic placement of "thus's" and "therefores" does not necessarily constitute demonstration; and as Veyne has suggested, it may be more appropriate to offer some information on the grounds simply that it is "interesting" ("c'est inter- essant que . . ."), the precise relevance being either indeterminate or yet to be determined, yet significant for evaluation and judgment. As in jurisprudence, meaning must be established not only through particular 41 Standard literature collected in William Dray, ed., Philosophical Analysis and History (New York, 1966); Patrick Gardiner, ed., The Philosophy of History (Oxford, 1974), and Theories of History (Glencoe, Ill., 1959); and Sidney Hook, ed., Philosophy and History (New York, 1963); while various Beiheften of History and Theory have gathered more extensive bibliography. 42 See Ronald G. Walters, "Signs of the Times: Clifford Geertz and Historians," Social Research, 47 (1980): 537-56. 43 Berlin, "The Concept of Scientific History," in Philosophical Analysis, ed., Dray, p. 13, and Veyne, Comment on ecrit l'histoire (Paris, 1971), p. 182. 44 Historical Knowing (Austin, Texas, 1976), p. 161.</page><page sequence="18">Historical Interpretation and Legal Hermeneutics 661 facts, their linkages and their classification, but also through what Geertz has called structures of signification and W. H. Walsh has termed "col- ligatory concepts," including correlations, coherences, and continuities which cannot be subsumed under the rubric of causation.45 "Interest" suggests another school of analytical philosophy, this one identified as "narrativist" (Maurice Mandelbaum calls it "reactionist"),46 though it is not really concerned with the philosophy of history as com- monly understood. Rather it is interest in history as the construction of "story" (the root meaning of "history") and so it has a closer affinity with the rhetorical tradition, which since the time of the sophists has carried on its own running warfare with philosophy. The strength of narrativism is that it has helped to redress the balance upset by the naive realism and naturalism which so often accompany the "normal science" of history. Yet it is also in danger of falling victim to the old "scissors- and-paste" fallacy criticized by Collingwood, to the extent that it tends to neglect or to undervalue the sort of intertextual criticism and controls by which historians try heuristically and imaginatively to restore earlier mental and social contexts. In any case narrativism, which takes its inspiration from literary criticism, tends to be, as Goldstein remarks of W. B. Gallie, "a philosophy of history for readers of history only."47 This is especially the case with textualists like Hayden White, who focus more or less hermetically on "historical imagination" and its literary expression, and of course critics like Foucault and Derrida, who have thrown off the "burden of history" altogether. Indeed this school seems in the process of declaring its independence of historical scholarship in much the same way that literary criticism has at times (and especially in recent times) separated itself from literature. This would be a pity, for the study of history needs the sort of scrutiny offered by this descendent of philological hermeneutics. VI But let us look more closely at the model of hermeneutics suggested by jurisprudence. The point of departure of the legal tradition has always been the conscious, willful, and in some sense "interested" subject. That this subject may be prey to unconscious, natural, or social forces beyond his control or perceptual horizons limits but does not change this 45 Geetz, The Interpretation of Cultures (New York, 1973), 3 ff., and Walsh, "Colligatory Concepts in History," in The Philosophy of History, ed., Gardiner, pp. 127-44. 46 "The Problem of Covering Laws," in The Philosophy of History, ed. Gardiner, p. 51. 47 Historical Knowing, p. 164.</page><page sequence="19">662 Kelley premise. In contrast to natural science this human orientation defines an evenly observable field and, in a metaphorical sense, a "perspective." It has been the boast of science that it has overcome subjectivism on several levels -that it removed man from his sovereign position first in the cosmos, then in nature, and finally in his own psyche. Yet this is not a view which can be maintained in the practical business of living, achieving, or even surviving, and certainly not of observing the remoter reaches of the human condition in the past. Social life is necessarily anthropocentric and in many ways, because of linguistic limitations, anthropomorphic; and hermeneutics makes this circumstance an axiom of historical understanding. The basic structure of conventional law derives from the ubiquitous juridical trinity of person, thing, and action (persona, res, actio), and I would emphasize four suggestive feautures of this arrangement.48 First is the principle of personality, which is to say that law is subject-centered and, in a variety of ways, concerned with individual will, or at least responsibility, consciousness, and judgment. Secondly, from this an- thropocentric point of view, a systematic attempt is made to comprehend the surrounding world of "reality," referring above all to social "things" (ranging from goods, or property, to complex institutions, culminating in the "public thing," the respublica itself). Third is the circumstance that legal interpretation must address itself not only to facts and "real" predicaments and to the "letter and spirit" of texts but also to questions of values, which implies problems of partisanship and "ideology" as well as social goals. Finally, like language but more broadly, law implies a large system of meaning in which facts and patterns acquire a significance in terms of location and relationship. In Betti's conception legal inter- pretation involves a two-fold operation which accommodates subject as well as object-attribution of human significance (Sinngebung) as well as determination of objective meaning (Auslegung).49 The historical observer struggles, then, with a cultural predicament as well as a recalcitrant and sometimes intractable object of study-a context as well as a text. He cannot observe and judge his domain with omniscient objectivity, and perhaps in his writing he should stop posing as the "omniscient observer" of Victorian fiction; for he is limited by cultural horizons, temporal perspective, and a largely impenetrable fu- ture.50 Looking around, the observer sees a natural world challenging 48 Further discussion in my "Gaius Noster: Substructures of Western Social Thought," American Historical Review, 89 (1979): 619-48. According to Betti's distinction this discussion focuses on "technical-juridical" interpretation in "historical" rather than "normative" terms. 49 Teoria, p. 574; Auslegungslehre, p. 438. 50 Cf. Martin Duberman, The Uncompleted Past (New York, 1965), pp. 43 ff.</page><page sequence="20">Historical Interpretation and Legal Hermeneutics 663 him, relatives and neighbors facing the same challenge, more remote actors competing with and perhaps threatening him; and he sees, or at least feels, the pressures and demands of institutions, political as well as social and economic. Looking back, through various professional aids, he may perceive a tradition, a heritage, which sustains and weighs on or obstructs -his own actions. Looking forward, he formulates hopes and aspirations, perhaps even programs of action, as well as doubts and fears. In all of these observations ego-centric value judgments and social interpretations must be formulated in a particular cultural and linguistic context. And as it is with the individual, so it must be, on a larger scale, with a society, with a meaningful social science, and with historical understanding in general. But if the interested, participating, time- , space- , and culture-bound observer must remain content with a limited social science, he also occupies a field of inquiry in which social interaction-"intersubjectivity" be- comes plausible and self-criticism possible (as well as necessary). Ha- bermas's "self-reflection of the cultural sciences" is a built-in condition.51 Interpretation, involving interaction between subject and object, takes place in an intellectual continuum, and here the legal analogy is clear. Legal interpretation likewise has to give priority to the person (legal "subjectivity") and to judge in terms of times, places, and circumstances, yet within a social and cultural tradition. The task of the juridical interpres is not only to determine the "facts" and to apply principles but also to evaluate the appropriateness of principles, themselves derived from earlier experiences, just as the historian must find some standard or resonance- "prejudice" in a nonpejorative hermeneutical sense- in his own expe- rience to give meaning in that of others. He observes and judges within a conventional social field and professional tradition which themselves represent both subject and object. In legal, and analogously historical, terms the interpreter makes transits of what is generally called the "her- meneutical circle." Such interpretation involves not only a hermeneutical circle connecting alien and familiar experience but also, as Gadamer has argued, a double focus including judge and the observed "reality" to which he is profes- sionally bound to "do justice." Hence it must also involve a double set of values, corresponding as it were to the home and alien territories. Here is one of the dilemmas of the hermeneutical process, familiar to critics through the quandaries involved in translation and historians in the form of anachronism. In methodological terms, for example, should nineteenth-century political, social, or psychological theory-institutional, 5' Knowledge and Human Interests, trans. J. Shapiro (Boston, 1971), p. 161.</page><page sequence="21">664 Kelley class- or psycho-analysis-be projected back into the Old Regime, and if so, how far? Or is it advisable to utilize what have been called "nativist theories," conceptualizations drawn and adapted from the cultural context of the object in question? In any case the past is indeed a "foreign country," and the guide books for which historians are responsible must try to show the ways in which "people do things differently there."52 Since understanding the past depends in part on appreciating its values, while its significance depends on modern values, the hermeneutical circle involves a most complex axiology. By it are determined the selection and definition of "facts," the patterns inferred and reconstructed from these facts, the "genealogy" of particular generalizations, and the long- range interpretation of the historical process. What preserves the integrity of the interpretive process, what makes it possible to complete the hermeneutical circle, is above all the medium of language, which like historical facts can only be understood in societal terms. "Everything in a given text which requires fuller interpretation," wrote Schleiermacher, "must be explained and determined exclusively from the linguistic domain common to the author and his original public."53 One consequence of this premise (much criticized by phenomenologists beginning especially with Heidegger) is that historians must often be content with convention rather than logic in their analyses-with "humanly followed rules," as Peter Winch- puts it, rather than with causal laws.54 The persistence of myth, ritual, and other metalogical behavior must be kept in mind when the historian pursues what E. D. Hirsch and Betti have called "recognitive interpretation."55 A corollary is that historical interpretation must take notice not only of language in general but of particular languages. It is a curiosity of most American and English work in the human sciences, especially sociology and most especially the analytical philosophy of history, that practitioners seem to assume that a science of society can be adequately formulated in a single brand of technical English devoted to generalized factors (and one may doubt that exclusive recourse to German-or Greek-is much more adequate). Her- meneutical understanding depends on the particularity and "thickness" which only varied linguistic experience can afford. Yet the language surrogate, like the "mathematical surrogate," is surely insufficient for a hermeneutics of history; for while it makes plausible 52 L. P. Hartley, The Go-Between (London, 1953), p. 1. 53 Cited by Hirsch, The Aims of Interpretation, p. 76. 54 "Concepts and Actions," in The Philosophy of History, ed. Gardiner, pp. 41-59, and cf.

According to the Whorfian view and what has been called "GWdel's theorem of language," language can yield no ultimate human meaning.56 This is where the legal theory of interpretation seems to open up the frontier of historical understanding. Unlike philological hermeneutics, which confines itself to the text, and unlike philosophical hermeneutics, which expands its horizons to existence itself as the text analogue, and unlike theological hermeneutics, which devotes itself to a still higher transcendent object-unlike all of these legal hermeneutics has concentrated, however artificially, on a concrete expression of human society and culture. Unfortunately, while hermeneutical attitudes have made their way into social and cultural science (especially in the work of Gadamer, Habermas, Ricoeur, and especially Betti), with many a glance back at the classical theory of interpretation, little or no attention has been paid to the legal model.57 By way of conclusion let me suggest some of the points at which the historical study of society and culture may draw (and perhaps inadvertently and uncritically have drawn) insight and inspiration from the tradition of European law. VII Contemporary hermeneutics seems to me monopolized by philosophers and literary critics, all of whom invoke the historical tradition but without a comprehensive grasp of it. The larger pattern of development should take into account not only the centuries-long interplay between philo- sophical and rhetorical interpretations-the debates of Platonism and sophism repeated in changing contexts, complicated by the intrusions of theology-but also the theories and practice of interpretation elaborated by ancient legal (and more recent social) science. Not that normative jurisprudence carrying on its strictly professional functions (any more than Christian theology, carrying on the pursuit of the "historical Jesus") can be imported directly into current hermeneutical discussions. The point is rather that the needs and interests of historians may be better served, their sense of the relevance of hermeneutics enhanced, by bringing into these discussions some of the questions, conventions, and connections made with the nowadays unfortunately isolated legal branch of the Western tradition of hermeneutics. Legal hermeneutics is unrepentently anthropocentric. It starts with a conception of personalitas, of the individual and perhaps psychological 56 Hirsch, pp. 50, 66. 57 See the collection edited by Paul Rabinow and William M. Sullivan, In- terpretive Social Science (Berkeley, 1979), and the work of Baumann (above, n. 1).</page><page sequence="23">666 Kelley aspect of the humnan condition; then goes on to realitas, which is to say social reality, based above all on the institutions of property and economic behavior; and finally treats actio, action theory, collective as well as individual. Within the framework of this conventional legal-sociological triad legal interpretation confronts a wide range of essential social cat- egories and concepts. Suffice it here to mention just a few types: ideas of social organization (family, kinship structures, corporative groups, subversive groups, administration, nationality), ideas of authority and power (popular and traditional as well as public, political, and admin- istrative), ideas of social interaction (commerce, war, international problems), ideas of social continuity ("wills," succession, inheritance) and discontinuity (the whole range of criminal law), ideas of social change (not only legislation but legal reform and the rise and fall of custom, consuetudo and desuetudo) and ideas of causation (one of the grounds for the claim of law to be a true "science").58 Of course modern legal science (since the thirteenth century) has been intensively interpreted and, through historical and comparative as well as philosophical methods, reinterpreted and transformed by these ideas. Legal science has never been value-free, however, and all of these themes have been interpreted in normative and even teleological terms: social organizations have their own goals (families to ensure their future strategies, corporate groups their "interests," etc.), authority is joined to "public utility," social interaction is supposed to further the common good and continuity, and social change is intended to take place in the direction of legal ideas, especially peace and justice, perhaps prosperity and political expansion as well, while causation has indissoluble ties with "just" and "good" causes.59 For the jurist these norms represent ideals, or at the very least professional pretexts; but for students of social and cultural structure and change they also reflect a basic dialectic of historical change. The point is not that historians should interject such values into their analyses but rather that the meaning of actions and perceptions should be assessed in terms thereof-and ideology be joined to society. For legal interpretation has always made an effort, according 58 A sampling of relevant works includes Riccardo Orestano, Azione, Diritti soggettivi, Persone giuridiche (Bologna, 1978); Paolo Zatti, Persona giuridica e soggettivita (Padua, 1975); Carol Maiorca, La cosa in senso giuridico (Turin, 1937); Peter Stein, Regula luris (Edinburgh, 1966); Pietro Costa, Iurisdictio (see above n. 20); and more generally Eugen Ehrlich, Fundamental Principles of the Sociology of Law, trans.

Bentham rejected the old legal tradition in favor of simplistic social calculus; Comte rejected it in favor of a naturalistic conception of society amenable to control by "positive" science; and Marx rejected it in favor of a dialectical method joined to economic analysis. For all of these jurisprudence was the ghost of a dead, or dying, culture, scientifically useless because of its freight of ancient conventions and "values"; for Marx, indeed, it was the very embodiment of bourgeois ideology.61 In the past century and a half these disciplines, since become vast and imposing professions, have been dominated by scientism, especially in France and England, where the legacy of positivism has been intimidating; and in various ways the study of history has fallen under the spell of quantitative and explanatory social science. For anthropology, on the other hand, and for the science of culture and more generally speaking, the inadequacies of economic or sociological reductionism have become increasingly obvious, especially with the passing of old-fashioned ideas of objectivity (Wertfreiheit) and naturalistic "explanation." And this, for historical studies, is where hermeneutics comes in. Dilthey and his followers have reached back profitably to older and in some ways richer conceptions of historical change and understanding, drawing in particular upon romantic literary and biblical interpretation. It seems to me that this line of inquiry could be deepened and given a more social orientation by attending as well to the insights and suggestions to be found in the legal tradition, though without neglecting the criticisms of recent philosophers, including Gad- amer, Habermas, and Apel, as well as Betti. And so the old question, "What is history?" this time in the light of the theory of interpretation associated with legal (and more recently 6( Geertz, The Interpretation of Cultures, and Skinner, " 'Social Meaning' and the Explanation of Social Action," in The Philosophy of History, ed.

To this question there have been many prescriptive an- swers, from the idealizations of Cicero ("the light of truth, the mistress of light," etc.) to those of E. H. Carr ("the study of causes"), from the mystifications of St. Augustine (the working out of God's "grand design") to those of Gadamer ("the great dark book . . . written in the language of the past"), and from the aestheticism of Pliny ("always pleases") to that of Hayden White (a story well told). My own preference lies between the extremes of philosophy, theology, and rhetoric. Like law and her- meneutics history is a human form of apprehension-prudentia or phro- nesis rather than episteme (or praxis, for that matter). And like legal interpretation, historical interpretation had the same ultimate aim, which according to Ricoeur remains "to make one's own what was previously 'foreign."'62 According to Johann Huizinga's still useful definition, "History is the intellectual form in which a civilization renders account to itself of its past."63 Without being too rigid, this formulation seems to provide for the traits of hermeneutics listed above: it is anthropocentric, value-oriented, responsible to tradition, and grounded in a meaning system. Less formally, it envisions the study of history as a human operation aimed at finding answers about the human past. What better way to express the significance of the partnership of Hermes, Clio, and Themis? 62 Interpretation Theory, p. 91; and see Richard Rorty, Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature (Princeton, 1979), pp. 315 ff., discussing the transition "from epistemology to hermeneutics." 63 "A Definition of the Concept of History," in Philosophy and History, ed.
