Salloum, and Clyde C. Culver Research Laboratories, General Motors Corp. THIS INVESTIGATION was undertaken to develop polymeric materials which would simulate the response of human muscle and ligaments when incorporated in dummy necks. The fol- lowing conclusions were made: 1 . To obtain the correct torque -displacement, the polymer must act as a short bending beam in compression. 2. Flexion and extension response can be incorporated in the same unit by changing the beam thickness. 3. Two systems were developed which fit the design criteria. The polymers are a cast polyurethane and a polyvinylchloride- chlorinated polyethylene (PVC-CPE) blend. NECK SIMULATION REQUIREMENTS More humanlike anthropomorphic dummies are needed to simulate people in impact environments. Human simulators are used to evaluate cars and automotive components under a variety of rapid deceleration conditions. In an effort to im- prove the correlation between human and dummy responses, many components of the dummy are being investigated by the automobile industry, the dummy manufacturers, and the government. The movement of the head is controlled to a great extent by the neck portion of the dummy. However, the neck assem- blies of the commercial dummies did not conform with data obtained in human tests (1)*. These data were obtained at Wayne State University by instrumentation of humans and cadavers that were subjected on an impact sled to different deceleration loads. Current neck simulations were found to be inadequate for simulating the neck response. (2) A split ball segmented design was developed for the neck and reported by the members of General Motors Corp. Biomedical Science Department. (3) This paper deals with the screening and de- velopment of the viscoelastic materials used in the split ball neck. The approach to the problem was dictated in part by the design of the metal portion of the neck (Fig. 1), which consists of a series of metal segments connected by split balls. The viscoelastic material fits between the discs. Therefore, the polymer used must simulate, while being in compression be- tween the discs, the response of the neck muscles and liga- ments under tensile loading. The composite metal-polymer neck must have a torque -angle response associated with head angle which falls in the envelope ι *Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper. ABSTRACT Several polymeric materials were developed and evaluated for possible inclusion in the neck structure of state-of-the-art anthropomorphic dummies. These included three types of foam- Polyvinylchloride, polyethylene, and polyurethane, and two flexible polymers- polyurethane and a Polyvinylchloride chlorinated polyethylene blend (PVC-CPE). Two materials, the polyurethane elastomer and the PVC-CPE blend, were found to be satisfactory in their dynamic response. Because of the ease of casting, the polyurethane material will be used in the GMR 1 state-of-the-art dummy. 3104</page><page sequence="2">Fig. 1 - Metal split ball neck structure determined from the humans tested (Figs. 2 and 3). (1 ,4) The shape of the envelope with zero slope over the central angular region suggested that a solid block of polymer might not be satisfactory when strained in compression. This was con- firmed by laboratory experiments, as shown by the response of a solid resistive element (Fig. 4). Unlike the response of the human neck, the torque obtained using the solid polymer block has a linear viscoelastic response when loaded by angular displacement of the disc. A single joint test apparatus (Fig. 5) was used to study the single joint response to angular inputs. A strain-gaged torque arm was used to measure the input torque, and a potentiometer measured the joint angle. Load and displacement were cross plotted on an oscilloscope from the strain gage and potentiometer output. The joint was ac- celerated by dropping a weight from several heights on a rod attached to the torque arm. This technique provided data for different angular displacements and accelerations. POLYURETHANE FOAM After examination of several solid polymers, including PVC, silicone rubber, natural rubber, and polyurethane, it was de- termined that the flat portion in the torque curve could not be obtained using this geometry. The next material evaluated was integral skin polyurethane foam. The foam resistive ele- ment had a cross section as diagramed in Fig. 6. Skin is formed completely around the part when it is foamed. How- ever, the top and bottom skin were removed on a lathe. The foam formulation used to produce this material is given in Table 1 During the molding cycle, the mold was held at .145° F and was clamped shut. A typical single joint response 140 - (70, 140) !

There is a rapid initial rise in torque followed by a plateau region which sweeps to the rapid rise in torque at high angular displacements. The molded foam was also found to be rate sensitive. Several samples were prepared and evaluated on the single joint tester. A computer mathematical model and laboratory experiments showed that the response characteristics were not sufficient to warrant further work. There was also consider- able difficulty in accurately controlling both skin formation and core foam properties. However, the integral skin foam had several important desirable qualities: rapid initial torque rise, a plateau at intermediate angles, and a rapid rise in torque at high angles.

To further de- velop this approach, several systems were tested including PVC and polyethylene foams, molded and machined PVC-CPE blends, and cast polyurethanes. PVC-CPE BLENDS It is generally known that specific mechanical properties can be obtained by blending two or more different polymers.

Therefore, these blends were investigated for possible neck application. One of the requirements for human neck simulation is a viscoelastic response, that is, the high mechanical energy damping factor. Necks based on rubbers had been found to be too elastic, whereas yielding thermoplastics or metals were not practical in that they would only be useful for a single loading. The PVC-CPE blends were intermediate between those extremes. Mechanical analysis of skinned polyurethane foam resistive elements indicated that the required neck re- sponse (Fig. 2) could be achieved by the buckling of an end- loaded beam. Evaluations of various configurations of the resistive element led to the final design as shown in Fig. 8. The blend consisted of 80 parts CPE, 20 parts PVC, 20 parts carbon black, 10 parts plasticizer, and 5 parts stabilizers. The composition was cross-linked with free radical-type initiators. The ingredients were dry blended and then mixed ona heated two -roll mill. The blend was then molded into a solid disc with a center hole and cured at 360° F for 20 min. The final configuration was achieved by lathe cutting and grinding. A resistive element made of PVC-CPE blend with the con- figuration, as shown in Fig. 8, was found to fall essentially within the Mertz response corridors shown in Fig. 9. The low angular displacement portion of the curve was achieved by the buckling of the beam section, A, in Fig. 8. At higher displace- ment, lips Β and C came into contact producing a rapidly in- creasing torque-displacement response. The high mechanical damping (large hysteresis loop) evident in Fig. 9 is a basic property of these blends. With resistive elements of this design, it is possible to ap- proximate a second feature of the human neck response. It has been found (1) that the human neck is more resistant to rotation to the front than to the rear. This behavior can be duplicated by providing a thicker section A to the front of the neck resistive element than to the rear (Fig. 10). The shape of the resistive element was achieved by offset grinding. OTHER MATERIALS Two other types of foam were investigated to determine if they would be useful in the neck simulation.</page><page sequence="5">3 1 08 G. A. CAMPBELL, ET AL. Fig. 10 - Resistive element designed to simulate both extension and flexion modes POLYETHYLENE FOAM - The polyethylene foam for the neck resistive elements consisted of a cross-linked blend of polyethylene (PE) and ethylene propylene rubber (EPR) blown to a density of 0.2 to 0.25 g/cm^. This plastic-rubber blend, being less stiff than the unmodified polyethylene, gave better control over the force-deflection character of the re- sulting resistive elements. Peroxide cross-linking improved the compression set resistance. A typical formulation consisted of 75 parts PE (Tennite 831 A - Eastman), 25 parts EPR (Vistalon 404 - Enjay), 5 parts TiC^, 2 parts Celogen OT (Uni- royal), and 1 part dicumyl peroxide. The blend was melt compounded on a two-roll mill at 260°F. The resistive elements were prepared by compression molding at 3 50° F and 2000 psi for 30 min followed by cooling under pressure. The amount of compound placed in the mold con- trolled the density. 60 ι - - SLED VELOCITY 22 FPS STOPPING DISTANCE 17.5 IN. 50 SQUARE WAVE 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 HEAD ANGLE RELATIVE TO TORSO (DEG.)

All other materials from Union Carbide. The force-deflection behavior of the polyethylene foam re- sistive element is a function of the PE/EPR ratio and foam density. Increasing the density or the percentage of PE in- creased the stiffness of the resistive element. The directional response of this system can be varied by using different foam formulations in opposite sectors of the same resistive element. The PE foam neck resistive elements closely simulated the lower deflection region of the neck response curve. The en- ergy absorption behavior of necks with these resistive elements was very good. They did not, however, give the steep rise in torque as maximum angular displacement was approached. PVC FOAM - Neck resistive elements were also made of open cell PVC foam. The PVC foam was chemically blown with 2-3 pph of azodicarbonamide from plastisols which were stabilized with lead phosphite. Both low and high molecular weight suspension grade PVC resins were used with a variety of monomeric plasticizers. Foam densities and concentrations of plasticizer were the controlling factors which varied from 0.5 o to 1 .0 g/cm and 60 to 100 pph of resin, respectively. The plastisol formulations were poured into molds which were then sealed and heated in a press at 350° F for 20 min at 1000 psi. The PVC foam resistive elements did not simulate human response as well as the other materials used in this study. The softer and less dense foams did not yield the proper hysteresis loops, while the stiffer and more dense foams did not exhibit the proper torque deflection curves. CAST POLYURETHANE - The cast urethane system was investigated because of the ease of making this material. Sev- eral formulations were developed which had different cross- link densities and stiffness. These were evaluated and, after several trials, a material which had the correct response was selected (Table 2). The preparation of these resistive elements was accomplished in the same manner as the polyurethane foam, except that the mold is not sealed. The torque displacement curves for extension and flexion are presented in Figs. 1 1 and 12. This neck system is currently being incorporated in the GMR 1 state-of-the-art dummy. SUMMARY The development of polymeric resistive elements for dummy necks has been undertaken by investigating several different chemical systems and confìgurational concepts. Polyurethane foam, PVC foam, and PE foam were found deficient in the overall properties needed to simulate human response. PVC- CPE blends and cast polyurethane were found to be suitable when shaped in the configuration of a short bending beam. The present state-of-the-art GMR dummy neck is equipped with polyurethane and PVC-CPE blend resistive elements. Because of ease of handling, cast polyurethane resistive ele- ments will be given foremost consideration for a production neck system. REFERENCES 1 . H. J. Mertz and L. M.
