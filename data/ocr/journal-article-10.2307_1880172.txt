INTRODUCTION Social conflict occurs in two basic forms: conflict between individu- als and society, and conflict between and among groups within society. Historians are predominantly concerned with the study of competing, conflicting groups, "the play of social forces." Freudian psychoanalysis, by contrast, is predominantly oriented to the analysis of conflict between individuals and society. Freud was certainly aware of the sociological dimension of analysis, but his attempts at explaining group behavior failed. Freud failed to create an adequate sociological frame of reference because he was concerned with intrapsychic conflict and consis- tently devalued the importance of external social reality.l Psycho- analytic ego psychology, which Freud introduced but which the post-Freudians have developed redresses this imbalance to a degree. Psychoanalytic ego psychologists are concerned with how individu- als orient themselves to social objects, and they emphasize the adaptive ability of people to cope with realistic problems. Ego psychology has thus moved well beyond the earlier psychoanalytic emphasis on drive and defense. Nevertheless, psychoanalysts have still not succeeded in systematically integrating the intrapsychic and social levels of analysis; the study of groups has continued to elude psychoanalytic theory. Psychohistory has developed in the context we have outlined, and the discipline reflects the strengths and weaknesses of psycho- 1 See the discussion in Fred Weinstein and Gerald M. Platt, Psychoanalytic Sociology (Baltimore, Md., 1973), pp. 7, 47. Moreover, Freud conceived of group relations only in regressive terms, at the expense of what psychoanalysts call "synthetic functions," i.e., perceptual and cognitive functions. Thus, in Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego (New York, 1965), pp. 16, 60, 68, Freud observed that people "constantly give what is unreal precedence over what is real," and man "wishes to be governed by unrestricted force." Man is a horde animal led by a chief toward whom only a passive-masochistic posture is possible. Freud bolstered this argument by reference to phylogenetic propositions which no psychoanalyst at present would want to defend.

Psychohistorians, therefore, are involved overwhelmingly with biographical analysis as opposed to the analysis of groups and movements. Moreover, because there is in psychoanalysis no systematic way of relating psychodynamics to social processes, psychohistorians have not taken full advantage of the findings of ego psychology in their biographical work. Psychohistorians still largely explain individual behavior in terms of drives and defenses, that is, inevitably, in terms of neurotic and regressive forces, at the expense of reality factors. Historians have thus remained skeptical of the psychohistorical enterprise.2 II. THE SOCIAL WORLD IN PSYCHOANALYTIC THEORY: A CRITIQUE OF CLASSICAL AND EGO PSYCHOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO HISTORY References to external reality are quite common in the psychoana- lytic literature. Freud, for example, described the human dilemma as an inevitable conflict between drive-s and reality.3 The question, however, is what Freud meant by external reality and whether this meaning is adequate for historical work. Freud conceived of external reality in various ways in the course of his work.4 In Freud's earliest work, sexual trauma was under- stood to result from real external events, for example, parental seductions. Freud learned, however, that his patients' descriptions of these events were for the most part fantasies and had not actually occurred.5 Freud responded to this discovery by replacing the 2 See the review of psychohistorical contribution by the psychiatrist Robert Coles, "Shrinking History," New York Review of Books, pts. 1, 2 (February 22, March 8, 1973), pp. 15-21, 25-29, respectively. Coles suggested that a historian who ap- proaches his work with empathy, insight, common sense, and scholarly integrity will do good historical work and the theoretical categories of psychoanalysis cannot do much for him. We take exception to this position. Good theory illuminates: it serves to organize data. We have discussed our position.on the value of theory elsewhere, and we will not pursue the issue further (see Fred Weinstein and Gerald M. Platt, " History and Theory: The Question of Psychoanalysis," Journal of Interdisciplinary History 2 [Spring 1972]: 419-34). 3 See, e.g., Freud's New Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis, trans. and ed James Strachey (New York, 1965), p. 57. 4 In addition to the predominant conceptions-of reality discussed here, Freud also offered more random suggestions. For example, in his General Introduction to Psychoanalysis, trans. Joan Riviere (New York, 1968), p. 321 (hereafter referred to as the Introductory Lectures), Freud observed that society's motive for restraining sexuality was at bottom economic. And in Civilization and Its Discontents, trans. and ed. James Strachey (New York, 1962), p. 27 n., Freud commented on the importance of work in the conduct of life, in tying people to reality and to the community. But such statements do not have much import in a systematic sense. 5 Freud's first defense theory was against the meaning and affect of a reality experience and not against drive cathexis (see Robert Wallerstein, "Psychoanalytic</page><page sequence="3">204 Weinstein and Platt etiological role of seduction and other traumatic incidents with instinctual conflict, shifting his attention from external to internal events. Freud concluded that whether the external events had oc- curred or not, what really mattered was the individual's construction of reality, a construction that was based on the need to constrain drive expression.6 Freud generalized this insight to all relationships, including those between individuals and society. He took the position that society demands of people the renunciation of instinctual gratification in the service of order. However, Freud also assumed that because instinc- tual urges press continually for gratification, conflict between man and society is constant and inevitable. Drive and reality are irrecon- cilably opposed forces and people must forever be restless and discontented with life in society. People cannot satisfy their most cherished wishes; they must come to accept socially purposive substitutes. Their ability to do so is derived from moral mandates which, internalized in superego, serve to repress man's sexual and * . aggresslve lmpu ses. Freud conceived of external reality, then, as the network of cultural and moral values and norms which serve to orient people to society and its institutions. In sociological terms, these moral man- dates serve to guide and to structure behavior in relation to economic, political, familial, religious, and other institutions and to define the character of authority structures and legal systems as well as social systems of stratification and of the distribution of prestige. This normative level of behavior is not necessarily conscious, but it is real enough in that it encompasses beliefs and feelings about, and standards for, the evaluation of behavior in society. The normative orientation to social reality is very important, but it is not sufficient for purposes of historical analysis. We must add to it a sociological conception of actual behavior, a conception that Freud had in fact considered and then in a causal sense discarded. This focus on the actual behavior of people (originally of parents and others in their treatment of children but now suitably generalized to include all interactive behavior) must be reintegrated in any comprehensive notion of external reality. Moral and actual levels of behavior, after all, are analytically and practically distinct. Reflections on the Problem of Reality,$' Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association 21, no. 1 [1973]: 9-10; hereafter cited as J. Amer. Psychoanal. Assn.). 6 Freud thereafter did have patients whose problems derived in part from actual traumatic events. But in the end, what Freud meant by internal reality was the unconscious input to action, and whether an event had actually occurred or was fantasized did not matter; what mattered were the screen memories. On this point, see Freud's comments in the Introductory Lectures, pp. 376-77.</page><page sequence="4">Crisis in Psychohistory 205 People become involved in various roles which they approach in terms of a general orientation to appropriate behavior. But people must interpret these roles in the light of real circumstances, and there may be considerable latitude with regard to such interpreta- tion. Indeed, one's definition of appropriate behavior in an actual situation may force the violation of moral codes without leading to any disruptive sense of guilt. . . . And there is yet a third aspect of external reality Freud never systematically considered: the circumstances any society must face with regard to such factors as natural resources, physical environ- ment and demography. The availability or nonavailability of re- sources is not the result of fantasy or wish, even though it is a factor which people must take into account in their actions. The ratio of men to women in a society will also affect behavior (e.g., marital patterns or patterns of sexual practice). External events in such cases shape orientations to reality, including fantasy and wish. With the best will in the world, the problem cannot always be seen as Freud wanted to see it- the other way around. Though Freud tended to devalue the influence of external reality on behavior, it is important to note in this context that he continued to theorize about the problem. Freud took up the issue of external reality most forcefully in the late revisions of his theory, in his The Ego and the Id (1923), and then again in Inhibitions Symptoms, and Anxiety (1926).7 Freud sketched out in these works some rudimen- tary elements of a psychosocial position, including ideas about the ways in which children are related to and affected by loved persons. Freud considered character to be built upon the strength of relations with loved figures, initially the parents and subsequently other authoritative persons. This process of character development entails giving up external sexual objects in reality but preserving them intrapsychically via "an alteration of the ego which can only be described as a setting up of the object inside the ego." The implications of this "identification" process are obvious: it is 7 It has been pointed out before that in Inhibitions, Symptoms, and Anxiety, Freud turned to the problem of reality adaptations and established the theoretical basis for a concept of ego autonomy (Peter Barglow and Leo Sadow, "Visual Perception: Its Development and Maturation from Birth to Adulthood," J. Amer. Psychoanal. Assn. 19, no. 3 [1971]: 435). Ernst Kris observed in 1947 that Freud's reformulations in his work on anxiety reached further than was realized at the time and probably by Freud himself ("Problems in Clinical Research: Discussion Remarks," American Journal of Orthopsychiatry 17 C1947]: 210). For an example of how this orientation to external reality changes the nature of psychoanalytic interpretation, in this case with regard to the problems of women in this society, see Robert Seidenberg, "The Trauma of Eventlessness," Psychoanalytic Review 59, no. 1 (Spring 1972): 95-109 (hereafter cited as Psychoanal. Rev.).</page><page sequence="5">206 Weinstein and Platt by means of this process that patterns of socially appropriate be- havior are transmitted to the child. But even more important, Freud considered this process to result in the desexualization of object ties. Identification represents a ;;transformation of object libido into nar- cissistic libido"; there is implied an "abandonment of sexual aims, a desexualization- a kind of sublimation7 therefore."8 Freud subse- quently underscored the importance of this position by pointing, for example, to the capacity for reality testing which comes with mat- uration: In the course of development the superego also takes on the influence of those who have stepped into the place of parents-educators, teachers, people chosen as ideal models. Normally at departs more and more from the original parental figllres.... Nor must it be forgotten that a child has a different estimate of its parents at different periods of life, At the time at which the Oedipus complex gives place to the superego, they are something quite magnificent; but later they lose much of this.9 Freud contributed significantly in many other respects to the theory of ego development.1° The important point, howeverS is that 8 Sigmund Freud, The Ego and the Id) trans. Joan Riviere, ed. James Strachey (New YorkS 1962), pp. 2Q, 36. It should be said that Freud immediately ascribed sociological significance to this process, concluding that "social feelings rest on identification with other people, on the basis of having the same [superego]" (ibid., p. 27). In Erikson's terms, "Children at different stages of their development identify with those part aspects of people by which they themselves are most immediately aSected, whether in reality or in fantasy. Their identifications with parents, for example, center in certain overvalued and ill understood body parts, capacities, and - role appearances. These part aspects, furthermore, are favored not because of their social acceptabdity . . . but by the nature of infantile fantasy which only gradually gives way to a more realistic anticipation of social reality" (Erik Erikson, "Identity and the Life Cycle," Psychological Issues 1 [19S9J: 112; italics in original). 9 The material here is adapted from Henri Parens and Leon J. Saul, Dependence in Man (New York, 1971), pp. 49-53; the quote may be found on p. 50 (italics added). We have selected this work because the discussion is concentrated on the point we are addressing. The reader may note here Freud's observation that psychic structure is 'ideveloped by the exigencies of life," that the ego as an adaptive system acquires standards for the gratification of id wishes, and that the ego tends to pursue 4'the most favorable and least perilous method of obtaining satisfaction, taking the external world into account." The emphasis on ego and the ego's adaptation to reality is most important. It should be noted that Freud thought that identification with the "later" parents affected only the ego. Not long afterward, however, Robert Waelder pointed out (in ibid.) that superego must also be modified at the same time and in similar ways. 10 Freud paid particular attention to the problem of anxiety in this period, em- phasizing the capacity to master anxiety, especially in relation to separations from loved figures in childhood. This childhood mastery of anxiety became paradigmatic for dealing with danger situations in adult life in realistic rather than in regressive terms. Freud conceived of phase-appropriate forms of separation from loved figures; the capacity to control anxiety associated with such separations brings the individual to a higher level of ego autonomy and diSerentiation (see Freud, The Problem of Anxxety, trans. tIenry Alden Bunker [New York, I9631). Robert White suggested that Freud's organization of anxiety theory was compelling enough for him to place</page><page sequence="6">Crisis in Psychohistory 207 his ideas about the human ability to achieve separation and the desexualization of object tiesS along with other ideas of a similar quality, led after Freud to the concept of ;;secondary autonomy,'? that is, thoughts and character traits which can and do become relatively independent of their instinctual origins. These conceptions taken together lead in psychoanalysis to a theory of ego develop- ment and ego autonomy, a sense of the human capacity to be relatively independent not only of the drives but also of authority , ngures. Erikson picked up Freud's formulation of the development of ego autonomyS describing the effects of this-process throughout the life cycle instead of limiting it solely to childhood. FurtherS Erikson linked the process of ego development to 'specific aspects of the social order. He observed, for exampleS that identity formation depends on ;;economic opportunities? realizable ideals and available techniques s in a society. Erikson' s notion of identity formation includes the proposition that individuals reidentify with parents as workers and tradition bearers rather than as sexual and familial beings? arld he suggestss too, that ;;work mastery is in any culture the backbone of identity formation.' Eriksonss conception of identity further implies that individuals must develop social functions and status as indispensable supports for ego; selSesteem stems fmm the conviction thM -one is developing a defined personality within a comprehensible social reality.Il Through identification and these other developmental processesS then individuals become more independent of loved objects and sn anxiety on a par with libido and aggression as motivating forces (i'Ego and Reality in Psychoanalytic Theory," P*ychological I3sue3, monegraph 11 [New York, 19633). Funher, on the problem d what is referred to as separation-individuation see e.g. Margaret Mahler, ';On the First Three Sub-Phases of the Separation-Individuation Process," Intertzational Journal of Psychoannlysis 53 (3) 333-38 (hereafter eited as ht. J. Psychoana1.3. Mahler also refers here to oWect 1QSS as cxperienced matura- tionally and to separation-individuation from the standpoint of the entire life cycle. On the latter problem see Muriel C. Winestine, and Irwin M. Marcus, '; The Experience of Separation-Individuation in Infancy and Its Reverberations through the Course of LifeSS J. Amer Psychonal. Assn. 21, no. I (1973): 135-54 and 155-67, respectively. The developments we have oudined would also include the problems d ngcissism as these have recently been discussed. See, e.g., Heinz Kohut, The Anal:ysis of e Self (New YorkS 1971)7 Otto F. Kernberg, ;; Factors in the PsychoanSytic Treatment of Narcissistic Personalities,5' J. Amer. Sychoanal. Assn. 18, no. 1 (1970). 51-85; and, in the social terms we are considering here, Gregory Rochlin, Man's Aggression: The Defense of the Self (Boston, 1973). It is not yet possible to say how these different features of psychoanalytic investigation are related to each other there simply is no systemMic overview of the discipline. And in no case does any of this extend conceptually beyond the family in any eSective way. This represents a very specific source of the inability of psychohistorians to deal with what is of interest to them: what a person does or what people do with their lives in their time and world. llEriksonS pp. 128, 163, llle 89.</page><page sequence="7">208 Weanstein and Platt this way are enabled to accept a social situation in which tasks and rewards come to be organized outside the family. 12 Individuals become fully integrated into group and social life when libido7 mandest as ego interests7 is transferred from self to community, Freud and Erikson have suggested in short the necessity for focusing not only on biological needs and drive pressures but also on ego requarements. 13 Libido transferred to - the self, manifest as ego interests7 is the basis for the expression of character traits and for action in terms of internalized standards and expectations. These ego interests then represent the primary tie between the mature self and society. Encompassed in this tie are such functions as status, prestige? and rewards. The ability to act on ego interests? the ability to fulfill ego requirementsS bolsters self-esteem and serves to main- tain the sense of identity. In random instances of course, drive pressures may undermine the capacity to actS leading to various and unpredictable forms of behavior. But in a sociological sense, the ability to act on ego requirements generally leads to "expected behavior and thus to social stability, We can concludeS therefore that it is arbitrary to assume that people are related to economic or political processes primarily in terms of drive or defenseo The principle of multiple filnctions (e,g. that every act involves all levels of personality: id, ego superego) suggests irther that it is arbitrary to assume that the most important features of every act are the unconscious ones. People do attend to problems and issues that impinge on them in realistic ways Freud required the idea of isdesexualized? object relationships because he had to explain realistic behavior in consistent terms.14 12 See Roy Schafer, 4;An O^erview of Heinz Hartmannss Contribution to Psychoanalysis't h£t.

Freud wrote in 1917 that i'the life of ollr sesual instincts cannot be wholly tamed and that mental processes are themselves Imconscious and only reach the ego and come under xts control through incomplete and untrustworthy perceptions- these twn discoveries amount to a atement tht the ego is not mster in it own house" (;iA Difficulty in the Path of Psychoanalysis5' The Standard Edatfon of the Complete Worb of Sigmund Fread trans. and ed.

Kurt Eissler, discussing Freud's subsequent revision of anxiety theory writes that ';the reader can hardly firlish Freud's 1926 treatise on anxiety without getting the impres- sion that the egoe once endowed with the efficacy of the anxiety signal, is strong and well prepared to navigate the treacherous watersS with their dangerous undercu¢ents and backflows8 Xued in Weinstein and Platt Psychoanalytzc Sociology, pp. 50-51).</page><page sequence="8">Crisis in PsychohistoMy 209 Erikson added a psychosocial dimension to Freud's suggestions because it was necessary to root observations of behavior in particu- lar contexts. But these additions to theory have created serious problems for psychoanalysis. Ideas about identification, internaliza- tion, and related processes suggest that character traits and motiva- tions are or can become independent of drives. The classic position, derived from emphasis on instinctual conflicts originating in fantasy, points in the opposite direction: The result is an ever-increasing estrangement of ego psychology Eom psychoanalytic drive theory. Ego psychology has had to take account of the plasticity of behavior, of such phenomena as cognitive ;iautonomy from stimulation, of capacities for choice and volition, and of the development of abilities and intelligence.... As long as the ego was definitely secondary to drive, its satellite as it were, no intolerable difficulty was present. But with more and more evidence of nonsexual motivations, not easily linked to the basic drives, and the need to incorporMe adaptational motivations other than those of defense and the implementation of drive discharge, the theory really breaks apart. 15 See also in Weinstein and Platt many other statements of Freud's on ego strength and contrast these with the statement of 1917, above. Finally, Heinz Kohut recently said: "There is a place for ego autonomy; the rider off the horse; man as he reflects, coolly and dispassionately, in particular as he scrutinizes the data of his observations. But there is also a place for ego dominance: the rider on the horse; man asx he responds to the forces within himself; or as he shapes his goals and forms his major reactions to the environment; man as an effective participant on the stage of history." Of course, as Freud would have it, the rider is often thrown by the horse; there are personal and social disasters, and the human condition stands as a constant reproach. But human failure is not the whole of the story, and it is necessary to find the means to integrate all the dimensions of experience, not just the regressive (Heinz Kohut, "Narcissism, and Narcissistic Rage," Psychoanal. Stud. Child 27 [1972]: 365-66). 15 Freud essentially meant by internal reality the unconscious inputs to action. At the same time, however, Freud obviously had important ideas about ego dynamics and about levels of conscious control. The difficlllty is that the tWQ positions have not been integrated, although there are at present analysts who are striving to do so, most notably Roy Schafer. The quote is from George S. Klein, " The Ego in Psychoanalysis a Concept in Search of an Identity," Psychoanal. Rev. 56, no. 4 (1969-70): 520. Kl-ein, in fact, was the leading critic of Freud's metatheory until his untimely death. See also the following by Klein: "Freud's Two Theories of Sexual- ity," in ClinicaZ-Cognitive Psychology. Modes and Integrations, ed. Louis Breger (Englewood Cliffs, N;J., 1969), pp. 13641; "The Vital Pleasures," inPsychoanalysis and Contemporary Science: An Annual of Integrative and Interdisciplinary Studies, vol. 1, ed. R. R.

Holt, ';Beyond Vitalism and Mechanism: Freud's Concept of Psychic Energy," in Historical Roots of Contempor- ary Psychology} ed. Benjamin Wolman (New York, 1968), pp. 196-226. Freud's position, of course, has also been defended; see, e.g., Victor H. Rosen, "Ihe Role of Metapsychology in Therapeutic Interpretation," in Currents in Psychoanalysis ed. Irwin M. Marcus (New York, 1971), pp. 305-16. On thought processes and character traits that become independent of their drive origins see, e.g., Anna Freud, "The Mutual Influences in the Development of Ego and Id," Psychoanal. Stud. Child 7</page><page sequence="9">210 Weinstein and Plcltt This last point is further connected to a very significant sociologi- ca issue. The classic psychoanalytic view of life in societyS as we have noted? stressed the'inevitability of conflict between man and society because of the ever-pressing claims of the drives. But the contemporary psychoanalytic theory we have been discussing leads in fact to the opposite conclusion: ego-oriented integrative (rather than drive-oriented disintegrative) behavior is a critical feature of everyday life. Thus for example7 because identification is defined as ;'the acquisition of generalized . . . values attitudes beliefs moti- vated by an attachment to [a social] object,''16 it becomes theoreti- cally necessary to supplement Freud's idea of punitive superego with the idea of a "loving and beloved superego,''l7 to suggest a socially integrative function to superego analogous to'the integrative functions of ego.t8 (1952): 49. She writes that it is known from experience that ego interests which originate in narcissistic, exhibitionistic, aggressive, and other tendencies may persist a lifetime as valuable "sublimations" regardless of the fate of the original part instinct that gave rise to them. Thus, character traits may become a function of "secondary autonomy" and cannot be explained solely in terms of drive and defense. See also Rudolph M. Loewenstein, "Ego Autonomy and Psychoanalytic Technique," Psychoanalytic Qunrterly 41, no. 1 (1972): 3 (hereafter cited as Psychounal. Quart.). 16 W. W, Meissner, "Notes on Identification, pt. 2," Psychoanal. Quart. 4O, no. 2 (1971): 282. 17 Roy Schafer, "The Loving and Beloved Superego in Freud's Structural Theory,' Psychoanal. Stud. Child 15 (1960): 163-t38, explains why Freud focused only on the punitive features of superego; Schafer also explains that Freud had introduced the idea of a "benevolent" superego, a position which Schafer expands in this paper. As Schafer writes, "This is another place where a major theoretical position [of Freud's] is implied but not worked out. What we ordinarily call ego strength, for example, is seen in this connection as a matter of the mutual relations of ego and superego; the availability, and possibly the quantity, of energies, in the ego to be used in adaptation seem to depend in large part on a faithful, benevolent superego." Schafer now would undoubtedly repudiate the anthropomorphic and mechanistic language employed in this paper, but the principle would remain (ibid., pp. 169-70, 175). 18 Readers familiar with the contemporry psychoanalytic literature should not be surprised by this idea of nonpunitive, integrative functions of superego. Erikson's conception of individual development in a given social space and time, combined with his conception of 4'mutuality" of relationships, points to the integrative functions of ego and superego. Similarly, Heinz Hartmann, toward the end of his career, was coming to this very conclusion, that is, the relationship of the individual to society could not simply be a hostile one but had to include and even stress, in theoretical terms, integrative functions and behavior. On Erikson's concept of "mutuality" of relationships and the development of individual personality in a particular social and temporal space, see David Rapaport's introduction to Erikson's 4'Identity and the Life Cycle," p. 15. On Heinz Hartmann's changing views, see Schafer, "Heinz Hart- mann's Contribution to Psychoanalysis," p. 436. Freud, of course, conceived of socially integrative action but only in terms of punitive superego and at the cost of the ego's capacities for synthesis. For example, Freud explained that obsessive behavior was a private religion and that religion was public obsession. Religion, however, served to keep people from falling ill, and Freud thought, therefore, that the increase in neurotic behavior was the result of the declining influence of religion. But in this sense, social action in its integrative features is always regressiveX</page><page sequence="10">Crisis in Psychohistory 211 Freud's extraordinary cultural appeal has stemmed in large part from his critique of civilization, that is, from the sense of abiding tension and alienation between men and society and the imminent rebellion implicit in such an idea as "the return of the repressed." But this orientation of Freud's is derived from individual psychol- ogy, and it is applicable only to conflict between the individual and society.l9 19 Herbert Marcuse would, of course, disagree; in fact, he took precisely the opposite position in Eros and Civilization (New York, 1962). We cannot discuss Marcuse's position at this point, but we would like to underscore the relationship implicit in this paper between psychoanalytic theory and Marx's orientation to history and social change. In the past, attempts to link Freud's thought to Marx have centered on the drive theory. This is the basis of Marcuse's approach, obviously, but of course it is much more extensive than that [see, e.g., Wolf Lepenies and Helmut Nolte, "Experimental Anthropology and Emancipatory Practise (Reflections on Marx and Freud)," International Journal of Sociology 2, no. 1 (Spring 1972): 4-52]. This approach fails to persuade because it cannot surmount the analytic incongruities between Marx and Freud in drive terms and in terms of internalized morality as this is usually understood in psychoanalysis (implying, for example, fixity of character). First, there are, as noted, two paradigmatic forms of conflict at issue: Freud stressed conflict between man and society, Marx between groups within society. But furtherS Freud stressed the dynamically repressed, drives, and the unconscious; Marx stressed social reality and ego-oriented decisions based on interest and necessity. Freud stressed the disruptive tendencies within all individuals vis-a-vis culture, and he understood control to be a function of punitive superego (this last an over- simplification, but essentially true). Marx stressed disruptive tendencies as be- tween classes, but within classes he stressed the integrative features without any parallel to punitive superego (again an oversimplification, but essentially true of the workers). Finally, the actual expression of conflict in Freud's individual is idiosyncra- tic (in Psychoanalytic Sociology and in this paper, we have stressed libidinal expres- sion in these terms, but it seems that Freud considered that the patterning of ego functions was idiosyncratic in individuals, too). The actual expression of conflict in Marx is systematic. More specifically, Freud saw conflict arising from an internal predisposing factor (libidinal fixation) and an external factor (frustrationAbut the external factor was accidental for Freud. For Marx, of course, external factors are systematic, not accidental. (On this point, see Freud's Introductory Lectures, p. 355.) As we noted above, it is possible to explain systematic action in drive terms, via phylogenetic propositions. But even if we granted the viability of these propositions it would be difficult to explain the psychic and demographic heterogeneity of sociai movements. It is not clear, for example, why people from the same class and familial backgrounds should end up on opposite sides in a social conflict. This is not to say that we can accept Marx's sociological position; the criticism outlined below with regard to the uses of categories would apply as well to the category of class. This is to say, however, that the link between Freud and Marx is not in the drive theory but in the ego psychology. In the language of Freud's metapsychology analysis rendered in terms of genetic, dynamic, economic, structural, topographic, and adaptive terms the ego orientation is based particularly on adaptive considerations. "Adap- tive" has been vulgarly defined as being reconciled to the status quo and hence as ideological. But as we explained this in Psychoanalytic Sociology, chap. 4, and as we will indicate again below, adaptive responses include the need to master reality in terms of internalized mandates, and when social change renders these dysfunctional, radical action can follow. As there is no presumption of the automatic failure of that action, or, to say it the other way around, as it is possible that successful resolutions can issue from radical action, we fail to see the virtue of the continued stress on drives, especially in light of the logical problems we have outlined.</page><page sequence="11">212 Weinstein and Platt By contrast, a sociological study of contending groups within society can be derived only from those aspects of psychoanalytic thought that focus on ego orientations to reality, internalized ideals, and the integrative features of psychic and social structures. Radical critics have always been hostile to ego psychology precisely because of this integrative emphasis. Within such a framework, the impetus for rebellion, and hence for change, seems to disappear from psychoanalytic theory. However, this is not the case. A cogent view of revolutionary change can not only be derived from ego psychol- ogy but it can be derived in a way that is more consistent with historical evidence. Psychoanalysts are struggling to recast their discipline in order to resolve the problems raised by the drive and autonomy concepts.20 However, psychoanalysts have not yet examined the implications for history of the integrative stress that has emerged in the theory, nor have they resolved how the theory of autonomy is related to drive theory. Thus, it is hardly surprising that psychohistorians have largely avoided dealing with both problems and have sought the "safes' ground of drive and defense. This position, however, can never adequately encompass historical data; historians cannot generalize all actions in society in terms of fixed personal (and idiosyncratic) defensive resolutions to drive conflict. Psychohistorians, therefore, will have to resolve these problems or fail to create an empirically adequate approach to history. The central propositions of psychoanalysis, pertaining to drives and to ego, illuminate individual ontogenetic development. The explanatory power of the theory is fixed on the effects of activity from infancy through late adolescence. But whether we discuss individuals or groups, the decisive issue is the fulfillment of ego requirements in relation to real problems in the environment. Historians cannot treat all the contextual and environmental variables suggested by the need to fulfill ego requirements as subsidiary to the residual factors of childhood experience. The ontogenetic-familial orientation may be decisive for therapy, but the parallels between therapy and history are limited and risky at best. The problems of the historian and the problems of the clinician are distinct. 20 See, e.g., Roy Schafer, "Action: Its Place in Psychoanalytic Interpretation and Theory," inAnnual of Psychoanslysas, vol. 1 (New York, 1973), pp. 159-96. See also the references to Klein's work (n. 15 above). One major problem is Freud's metatheory, which is cast in mechanistic terms of force and energy. Some psychoanalysts would like to separate the mechanistic theory from Freud's clinical theory, which employs a different language, one of meanings, intentions, and pur- poses. For an introduction to this problem, in addition to Schafer, above, see Holt and Peterfreund (n. 15 above), pp. 3-24.</page><page sequence="12">Crisis in Psychohistory 213 Even Erikson's work is problematic in these terms. On the one hand, Erikson's theory of psychosocial stages through the life cycle is still directed toward the analysis of individuals, focusing on childhood conflict in ontogenetic terms.2t On the other handS Erik- son did make the problem of social order prominent in psychohis- tory and he did also consider the real age- and phase-appropriate problems adults face in relation to various dimensions of the social order. But Erikson's theory is so tenuous that psychohistorians have been unable to pursue his leads. Psychohistorians have tended to ignore important aspects of Erikson's work even at the level of biography, for example, his ideas about phase-appropriate, interlock- ing, complementary conflicts between parents and children.22 The social structural implications of Erikson's workS however, are even more important, and these have hardly been systematically pursued or even critically appraised. To the extent that psychohis- torians have attempted sociological analysis, they have rooted them- selves in Erikson's ideas about childhood development and familial socialization. But the family presents difficulties as a basis for sociological generalization.23 For example, one cannot predict the psychodynamic consequences of life for children in the same family, let alone for all children in a give-n society, and particularly not in the drive and defensive terms which are so often chosen as the basis for psychohistorical explanation. Writers in one discipline will sim- plify the variables in another as the disciplines move toward integration.24 But in failing to take advantage of or pursue critically 21 See, in reference to this point James T.

'23 Erikson's theory presents other problems for the study of mass phenomena as well. For example, mass movements cut across age (as well as class and other) lines, and a frame of reference is needed to explain this. Erikson has not provided one. We should also note that psychoanalysts are themselves beginning to see the problems raised by the family for sociological analysis; see, e.g., Robert Wallerstein, " Psychoanalytic Perspectives on the Problem of Reality," J. Amer. Psychoanal. Assn. 21, no. 1 (1973): 22; and John A. Lindon, "A Psychoanalytic View of the Family: A Study of Family Member Interactions," Psychoanalytic Forum 3 (1969): 18-19. See also Dale R.

Rev. 60, no. 3 (Fall 1973): 365. The psychosocial orientation developed by the Frankfurt school was also based on the vicissitudes of familial socialization. Our statements apply to this position as well. 24 Robert S. Wallerstein and Neil J. SmelserS ;'Psychoanalysis and Sociology: Articulations and Applications," Int. J.

Thus, one writer attempted to identify the motivational and affec- tive preconditions of revolutionary behavior, focusing on "a simplified psychodynamic portrait of the revolutionist." Social, economic, and political factors which impinge on revolutionary be- havior were held equal, with no implication, of course, that such factors are unimportant. "These kinds of factors have been rather extensively studied, however, while the psychology of the rev- olutionist has been rather neglected."25 But while these social, economic, and political factors have been extensively studied, they have not been systematically studied in connection with psychological variables. The purpose of an inte- grated approach is precisely to connect to each other the personal and social levels, the psychic and social realities. Abc)ve all, there is no way to separate these phenomena from each other or to hold constant the social order while analyzing the psychology of indi- viduals (e.g., revolutionaries) and! come to a sensible conclusion. There is no "psychology of the revolutionist" independent of his or her circumstances as an actor in a particular situation of social crisis. There is no special style of upbringing, no special range of experiences which would enable us to identify a revolutionary type or distinguish a revolutionary from other people.26 Psychoanalysis in its present form, then, including ego psychology and Erikson's contributions, is not adequate to the analysis of group P lenomena. . ze t zeory as it stands forces attention on the biog- raphies of elite figures. But the persistent focus on ontogenetic- familial factors makes psychoanalysis problematic for history even at this level, as the discussion on "the psychology of the revolution- ary" was meant to indicate. Moreover, most psychohistorians do not really believe that indlvidual biography is so important that it warrants such concentrated attention. This contradiction alone is enough to call the whole enterprise into question. In order to avoid the consequences of the dilemma we have outlined, psychohistorians must reexamine psychoanalytic proposi- tions in light of the problems presented by history. We refer to propositions concerning ego and the.ego's modes of adaptation to 25 E. Victor Wolfenstein, The Revolutionary Personality (Princeton, N.J., 1973), pp. 16, 23. Wolfenstein is a political scientist, and his work should more properly be referred to as psychosocial rather than psychohistorical per se. But because the assumptions that undergird any individual analysis are the same as those employed typically by psychohistorians, we will treat the work in these terms, returning to an examination of it below. 26 See Coles (n. 2 above), pt. 1, passim.</page><page sequence="14">Crisis in Psychohistory 215 social reality; nothing is so central to psychohistory as an adequate theoretical and practical grasp of the ways in which people orient themselves to the real exigencies of daily life.27 We have been critical of Freud's cultural and historical perspectives in these terms, but we have also identified an important line of thought in Freud's clinical and theoretical work quite relevant to this task. Freud's reformulation of the anxiety theory (1926) is particularly crucial in this respect. Freud indicated that anxiety may result from internal or external causes, though he still focused on internal dynamics. But Anna Freud, in her classic The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defense written a decade later, repeated this prop- osition and observed moreover that behavior is the same whether the source of anxiety is internal or external. Anna Freud argued, in other words, that regressive experience may be forced by threaten- ing unconscious impulses which require such defensive maneuvers that behavior becomes constricted and limited. But she went on to point out that such experience can also be forced by external conditions which affect the capacity of people to act on iIlternalized standards and expectations. In the first instance, drive regression affects the ego; in the second, ego regression, forced by the inability to master reality problems, implicates the drives.28 The decisive point herend the indispensable step in linking ego requirements to external social factors, making psychoanalytic ob- servation consistent with historical perspectivess the reversal of the classic drives-reality paradigm. Inevitably, from a historical viewpoint, the correct perspective must be ego-drives and not drives-ego. Drive expression is important, of course, but it must be viewed as subordinate to a more basic problem. Soclal conflict is not a matter of the eruption of drives, as Freud insisted. Social conflict occurs when the integrative bases for action in society are disrupted by change a conclusion implicit in the direction pursued by psychoanalysis since Freud. The mass behavior that follows must be understood as a response to real problems in the social world which afEect the capacity of people to act on culturally valued standards and expectations. 27 The interests of history and psychoanalysis diverge most elearly at this point. For various reasons, reality factors have proved to be the last sphere of systematic interest for psychoanalysts while such factors are of the first importance for history. On the slowness of psychoanalysis to address itself to reality factors see, e.g., Robert Wallerstein, " Psychoanalytic Reflections on the Problem of Reality," J. Amer. Psychoanal. Assn. 21, no. 1 (1973): 6; and Edward M. Weinshel, "The Ego in Health and Normality," J. Amer. Psychoanal. Assn. 18, no. 3 (1970): 718. 28 Anna Freud, The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defense, rev. ed. (New York, 1966), pp. 54-61 .</page><page sequence="15">216 Weinstein and PUtt More specifically, social conflict follows from a situation which threatens the sense people have of the adequacy of their behavior in particular contexts; behavior in such a sitwation no longer "feels right." Social conflict then7 stimulates unusual and unwelcome drive and affective experiences in people. The response to such experiences may entail a search for the consolations of the past, that is, "inappropriate" solutions for terminating such experiences. But social conflict may also lead to revolutionary solutions7 to a greater degree of personal freedom, to changed images of self and society, which are independent of the historical and/or personal past.29 This orientation to psychoanalytic insight emerges from a sys- tematic consideration of reality factors in analysis. The question arises, of course, as to why psychoanalysts and psychohistorians have been so slow to take wp these ideas, which, after allS are more consistent with historical endeavor than the classic position. We cannot attempt an answer to that here at bottomn this is a problem in the sociology and psychoanalysis of psychoanalysis.30 But there are two aspects of the problem that we will discuss in an effort to elaborate the approach we have outlined: the implications for psychohistory of ontogenetic propositions in psychoanalysisS and the psychoanalytic view of reality as implicitly or explicitly expressed in therapy and in the literature.31 29 We cannot discuss here all the variables involved in the solution of social conflict. But obviously, leadership and ideology are crucial factors; revolutionary leaders, as we know from experience, can contain and manipulate drive and affective experience. It is not necessary in these terms that drive and affect undermine the hold on reality. 30 In a very specific way this is an ideological problem, and as one feature of this it is necessary to consider the exclusive "possession" of psychoanalysis by psycho- analysts,- which raises questions about medicine and psychiatry in the West. For example, in a letter to Paul Federn of March 27, 1926, Freud wrote that ias long as I live I shall resist that psychoanalysis be swallowed up by medicine." Compare that statement, which refers to the problem of lay analysis and to the uses of psychoanalysis in the pursuit of cultural problems, which does not require a license to practice medicine, with the situation as it has existed for, say, over fifty years in the United States (see E. Federn, "How Freudian Are the Freudianso Some Remarks on an Unpublished Letter,5' jourMal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences 3 [1967} 270). In any case, we do not want to leave the impression that we think the problem is an intellectual one, although we may discuss it in such terms for limited purposes. 31 There is a third important problem, referred to in psychoanalysis as "transfer- ence." Transference refers to unconscious and inappropriate feelings about and perceptions of a person. The feelings and perceptions are a repetition-of responses that originated in regard to loved persons in childhood displaced onto a person in the present. Transference is always regressives it ignores or distorts reality. This pertains specifically to the relationship of patient to analyst but it has been generalized to include all relationships. However, there is also a reality factor involved in the patient-analyst relationship, a factor that must alsc) be generalized to include all relationships. The literature on transference is enormous.

SOME IMPLICATIONS FQR PSYCHOHISTORY OF ONTOGENETIC PROPOSITIONS IN PSYCHOANALYSIS The problems raised by ontogenetic propositions are a matter of considerable concern to psychoanalysts. Peter Blos has suggestedS for example, that the psycheanalytic tenet that an infantile emotional disturbance lies at the core of every adult neurosis has survived the many years of discussion that the concept of infantile neurosis has evoked. This clinical fact has become so closely 1inked with the definition of the adult neuresis that the latter has often been construed as the mere repetition or continuation of an illness that originated in pre-latency. This simplistic formulation, however, has been challenged by child observation, longitudinal studies, and child analysisS which have pointed out the diffuse and transitory nature of most infantile disturbances5 as well as the fact that these are, more or less a ubiquitous part of normal child development. It has been generally accepted, moreover that pre-latency disturbances are unreliable predictive indicators of the nature and severity of an adult illness.32 Blos further quotes Anna Freud to the effect that ';there-emerged first a disappointing discovery concerning a discrepancy between infantile and adult neurotics.... there is no certainty that a particular type of infantile neurosis will prove to be the forerunner of the same type of adult neurosis. On the contraryS there is much clinical evidence which points in the opposite direction¢" Gregory Rochlin has also warned against expecting a literal expression of a repetition in later life of earlier childhood conflicts, Rochlin in tuin refers to Jeanne Lampl-de Groot's comments on the fallacy of sCtransposing back.' Erikson's admonitions against "originology,' by which he meant ';a habit of thinking which reduces every human situation to an analogy with an earlier one, and most of all to that earliest, simplest, and most infantile precursor which is assumed to be its worigin must also be viewed in this perspective.33 Iiterature deals with the reality capacities of people in analysis. Psychohistorians have employed the theory of transference in their work-following the strong tendency in the literature but they have not explored the reality factors involved in human relationships. Once again, the clinical situation and the historian's interests are not equivalent, and the same emphases would not apply to both situations. We will discuss this problem at another point. On the reality factor in therapy and for definitions of both orientations to the analyst, see Ralph R. Greenson and Milton Wexler, "The Non-Transference Relationship in the Psychoanalytic Situation," Int. J. Psychoanal. 50 no. 1 (1969): 28-29.

For Gregory Rochlin's commentss see</page><page sequence="17">218 Weinstein and Platt The point is that "there is no rigid causal chain between an infantile trauma and a later neurotic illness. The adaptive outcome? whether neurotic or healthy, if it is traced along a developmental continuum, cannot remain identical throughout and therefore cannot be regarded as unchanging or unchangeable." A phobic neurosis in childhood may well change subsequently into a compulsive- obsessive neurosisS or there may be no neurotic illness at all. "It is by no means a novel idea that the irruption of a neurotic illness can be aveAed, despite the existence of a neurotic potential, whenever the growing individual is able to draw on constitutional resourcesS object relations, and environmental conditions so as to work out a serviceable adaptation to life"34 There is no ;irigid causal chainss no Enear progresslon from an e£rly point in childhood to a bter point in adalt life becaase ego development and socialfActors intrvene. In short, the resolution to adult conflict occurs at such a qualitatively different level in terms of personal development and social demands from the earlier resolution that the two are not really comparable. Oedipal conflict is experi- enced again in adolescence, but this time it is carried toward a final conclusion 4;on a higher level of intgration while the individual moves toward a more definitive mastery of the attendant conflicts. . . . The respective resolutions will therefore be dissimilar, regard- less of whether they are normal or pathological in nature.'35 Erikson has also observed that "the final identity . . . as fixed at the end of adolescence is sllperordinated to any single identification with individuals of the past: it includes all significant identifications but it also alters them in order to make a unique and a reasonably coherent whole of them.Ss This identity process forces ';the young individual into choices and decisions which will, with increasing Winestine (n. 10 above) pp. 143-44.

On Erikson, see Eriksonss Young Man Luther (New York, 1962), p. 18.

With regard to longitudinal studies see, e.g., M. L. Rutter, "Relationships between Child and Adult Psychiatric Disorders,&lt;' Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavia 48 (1972): 3-21, esp. pp. 5-19; and L. N.

To be sure, adult neurosis is linked up to genetic sources, but it did not exist "in an immutable form," and the form that it finally assumes Cquires delineation and structure in the adult years. Infantile and adult neuroses are "complementary formations: both depend on an advanced stage of ego development for their structuralization, and they are forced into existence simultaneously by the adaptive demands that physical maturation, instinctual de- velopment, and social fitting-in exert on the young personality."37 Now, in spite of such admonitions, psychohistorians invariably interpret behavior in terms of the infantile neurosis, or at least in the language of drive and defense, and social objects in the immediate environment-are taken as substitutes for earlier familial objects.38 Ego development and "social fitting-in" are not seen as affecting this process in any practical way. The pervasiveness of ontogenetic propositions in psycheanalysis has constantly directed attention away from problems of realistic interaction between the individual and society.39 These propositions also give the impression of an inevitability of action which is belied by the complex nature of the social world. It is because the social world changes and because people approach various roles with general expectations which re- 36 Erikson, ''Identity and the Life Cycle," pp. 113, 110-11 (italics added). 37Blos, pp. 109, 113. 38 It should be understood that the language of drive and defense is used to explain both symptom formation and the development of character traits; this raises problems for the theory of character development (see Martin N. Stein, "The Problem of Character Theory," J. Amer. Psychoanal. Assn. 17, no. 3 [1969]: 677). 39 For an appreciation of the importance of the genetic viewpoint in psychoanalysis, see Anna Freud, Difficulties in the Path of Psychoanalysis: A Confrontation of Past with Present Viewpoints (New York, 1969), pp. 50-51. However, as we have noted several times, parallels between clinical concerns and historical concerns are limited and risky, and the historian must be aware of this problem. The genetic model served Freud well enough, it should be remembered, because he thought in ahistorical and cyclical terms. No one was more emphatic than Freud about the proposition that the more things change the more they remain the same. Historians, however, typically think otherwise and must therefore be wary of the genetic mode. As one author phrased it in regard to this point, "There are ways that tomorrow cannot be fitted into yesterday's categories" (Lawrence Friedman, "How Real Is the Realistic Ego in Psychotherapy?" Archives of General Psychiatry 28, no. 3 [1973]: 381).</page><page sequence="19">220 Weinstein and Platt quire flexibility of interpretation that the stress must be on ego requirements and ego orientations to reality. The emphasis on drive expression and defense does not help us understand how anyone faced with real problems can make realistic decisions in regard to them. Psychohistory is most frequently criticized on these grounds, because the strong impression resulting from the emphasis on these aspects of ontogenetic development is that no one in fact makes, or even can make, realistic decisions. IV. THE PSYCHOANALYTIC VIEW OF REALITY There is also a tendency in psychoanalytic therapy (it exists in the theory as well) to assume that there is one reality "out there" which the analyst knows and which he can bring his patient to see and act on.40 This tendency derives in part from the failure to make the distinction between moral and actual levels of behavior that we discussed earlier and in part from Freud's assumption that there is one legitimate moral basis for action in a culture, internalized in the superego. Social reality, however, cannot possibly be formulated in one way for all "realistic" egos. The analyst in fact cannot tell his patient "how the world really works," because there is no one way to make it work and no one way to understand how it does or should work. In complex societies except in the broadest terms -there is no single moral basis for action or belief. There is no approach to reality that is not molded by class, age, religion, unique experiences, and the changing circumstances and situations of everyday life. Yet psychoanalysts and psychohistorians approach their data as if there were one realistic way to act in a given situation. There is little sense in psychoanalysis of widely divergent appropriate forms of behavior based on different legitimate orientations to reality.41 There is little sense of social structural changes impelling psychic 40 "The well known adage 'the analyst stands for reality' is often misinterpreted to mean that the analyst must concern himself with orienting the patient in some general way regarding worldly realities" (Paul Gray, "Psychoanalytic Technique and the Ego's Capacity for Viewing Intrapsychic Activity," J. Amer. Psychoanal. Assn. 21, no. 3 [1973]: 478-79). There are many such references in the literature, but this one is indicative. Moreover, because this must be understood not only in terms of any analyst's personal preferences but in terms of ideology in the sociological sense that Marx intended, the situation is actually more pervasive in psychoanalysis than is implied in this quote. The social position of the analyst is bound to compel ideological interpretations of behavior indeed, psychoanalysis is peculiarly vulnerable to this process. 41 See Roy Schafer, "The Psychoanalytic Vision of Reality," Int. J. Psychoanal. 51, no. 3 (1970): 179. Schafer refers to this problem, but such a reference is rare in the psychoanalytic literature.</page><page sequence="20">Crisis in Psychohistog 221 reorientations except in terms of punitive superego, guilt, and re- gressive behavior.42 Psychoanalysis invites single interpretations of behavior and derogatory interpretations of "deviant" behavior. 43 This is a posture that follows from rigid adherence to ontogenetic propositions and consequent notions of fixity of character and the impoverishment of ego "energies" in defense against the thrust of impulsive wishes. Thus, psychoanalysts and psychohistorians tend to become ideological, to formulate subjective and socially interested interpretations, insisting that these are the result of objective scrutiny.44 The idea that a single moral orientation binds action in society is not peculiar to Freud. It is characteristic of such diverse writers as Rousseau, Marx, Durkheim, Sorel, and George Herbert Mead (morality being variously referred to as the general will, class con- sciousness, the sacred, the generalized other). But this idea is particularly important in psychoanalysis because it explains the dynamic forces that inhibit aggressive action against a depriving environment. Guilt, for example, may be experienced even for the thought of transgression. However, because such drive and affective expressions are idiosyncraticS this orientation can be applicable only to individual psychology, as we explained earlier. A systematic sociological orientation requires another view. The fact that reality cannot be formulated in one way for all realistic egos, that ego and superego processes overlap but are not entirely congruent, suggests a principle of multiple moralities, or multiple orientations to reality. There may be agreement in broad terms in a society on general principles (e.g., the sanctity of life, the use of a common language). But beyond that, the class age, reli- gious, ethnic, regional, and personal differences that characterize complex societies are bound to affect behavior. We stated earlier that social conflict arises not from drive expression but from re- sponses to real problems in the social world which affect the capacity of people to act on internalized standards. We may now sAte more specifically that social conflict stems from different and 42 It is not that reactions to change in these terms have not occurred, but the fact is that such reactions in situations of change have also not occurred, and it is difficult to explain this in psychoanalytic terms. 43 See Friedman, i;How Real Is the Realistic Ego in Psychotherapy?" pp. 377-83. 44 We can underscore the nature of ideological interpretations in psychoanalysis best by example, such as the following: ;iThe Weathermen are a small fringe of individuals in whom the reaction formation against violence did not take solid hold' (Martin Wangh, i4Some Unconscious Factors in the Psychogenesis of Recent Student Uprisings," Psychoanal. Qaart. 41, no. 2 [1972}: 216, n. 13). Such a statement does not represent a psychoanalytic interpretation butS a political choice couched in psychoanalytic language.</page><page sequence="21">222 Weinstein and Platt competing orientations to action based on incompatible views of reality, a situation which arises when internalized standards become ineffective or dysfunctional because of social change. Drive and affective expression are manifest in situations of conflict because of the resistance to the domination of one moral orientation over others. But if there were no resistance there would be no drive and affective expression systematically affecting behavior, or none worth speaking of. This view is not only more consistent with historical and sociological requirements but it also enables us to surmount the ideological judgments that are bound to follow from the idea of a single morality. And further, it permits us to appreciate and to understand the perspectives of the conflicting factions, separately and in relation to each other. V. A TYPICAL EXAMPLE OF THE PSYCHOHISTORIAN s DILEMMA In order to see how the ontogenetic, reality, and transference problems constrain and delimit interpretation in practice, it will be instructive to review critically a work we have already referred to, E. Victor Wolfenstein's The Revolutionary Personality, in particular his analysis of Lenin. In Wolfenstein's view, . . . the revolutionist generally is a person with severe conflicts over masculinity. He is a person on the one hand whose Oedipal hatred of his father has not been dissipated and on the other, who feels unusually guilty about asserting his masculinity. In the leader this pattern- is accentuated because the individual has a more grandiose image of his own masculine powers and more intense feelings of guilt. The sense of power grows out of some apparent manifestation of the strength of one's sexual desire, such as the hoped for death of the father in the [case of Lenin].... But because the Oedipal wish is so literally fulfilled, a great guilt builds up which can be assuaged only through the most radical measures, by sexual asceticism in particular and a thorough self denial in general.... The leader's propensity to suSer provides an indication of his view of authority relationships: either one kills the father via the assertion of one's masculinity and courage or one is punished by him. Moreover, the image of both the father's and one's own powers is preserved larger than life, maintained at the level of development of the Oedipal conflict and its rebirth during adolescence.45 Wolfenstein thus establishes oedipal conflict as the origin of rev- olutionary aspiration and potential. In Lenin' s case we have an intense love-hate relationship with his father, originating in fantasy. This relationship could not be expressed but was resolved in a highly idiosyncratic and fortuitous way, permitting disciplined politi- cal action.46 The action, however, betrayed its drive origins by the 45 Wolfenstein (n. 25 above)? pp. 228-29. 46 Ibid., p. 98.</page><page sequence="22">Crisis in Psychohistory 223 expression of unconscious guilt and by the way that the good and bad features of the father were split and respectively displaced onto Marx and the tsar.47 In this way Lenin could find a place for himself that was confirmed both by the revolutionary tradition and by the internalization of an alternative morality. Lenin, then, could turn an internal problem into an external one.48 All these transference manifestations notwithstanding, Lenin was a singularly successful man whose remarkabl-e talents and prodigious energy were in no small measure responsible for one of the great events in world history. Moreover, even Wolfenstein sees Lenin as an unselfconscious man, a man of simplicity, a posture which is "a sure indicator of a highly integrated and self-confident personality." Lenin was able to achieve this kind of stability on the basis of ego strength ("presumably because he has received adequate support and love from the people in his environment") and the facilitating contemporary conditions. He also mastered his guilt through the internalization of ideology, the legitimation of aggression, identifi- cation with his father's virtues, and ascetic control.49 The oedipal-transference relationship described by Wolfenstein is based on the psychoanalytic theory of character development as a function of drive expression and defense. This drive and defense scheme is critical for Wolfenstein's argument because he must identify some dynamic force propelling Lenin's revolutionary ambi- 47 Wolfenstein writes, "In Marx Lenin found a benevolent, omniscient father, a wise and methodical teacher, a fit repository for the feelings of love and respect for his real father. And in the Tsar, the perfect embodiment of the vengeful oedipal father, he found his dangerous opponent, over whom, however, Marx promised victory" (ibid. , p. 11 7). 48 Ibid., p. 14. The emphasis on the sexual component of the problem does not leave room for a consideration of aggression except as a response to the frustration of sexual wishes. On the one hand, this is not the position that Freud finally took with regard to aggression as an independent instinct, as in Civilization and Its Discontents; and on the other hand, it ignores the possibility of aggression expressed as a means of defending self-esteem and narcissistic integrity, more or less independent of sexuality. This is the position taken by Rochlin in his Man's Aggression (n. 10 above). Rochlin, in other words, does not view aggression as an end but as a means in the service of self-esteem. On the problem of self-esteem and narcissistic integrity as the source of radical activity, see Weinstein and Platt, Psychoanalytic Sociology,- chap. 4. That Freud had considered aggression in ego terms is clear from the following quote: "The ego hates, abhors, and pursues with intent to destroy all objects which are a source of unpleasurable feeling for it.... Indeed, it may be asserted that the true plrototypes of the relation of hate are derived not from the sexual life, but from the ego's struggle to preserve and maintain itself. As an expression of the reaction of unpleasure . . . [hate] always remains in an intimate relation with the self-preservative instincts" (Freud, "Instincts and Their Vicissitudes," 14:138-39). The terms Freud employed in this work are not the same he employed in subsequent discussions of the ego. But changing the terms presents no problem. 49 Wolfenstein, pp. 120, 136, 168.</page><page sequence="23">224 Weinstein and Platt tions. Given the classic emphasis in psychoanalysisS Wolfenstein necessarily focuses on the vicissitudes of drive expression in an oedipal situation of"unusual" intensity. Political authority is as- sumed to be a surrogate for the father, and views of authority must therefore be distorted.50 This kind of analysis is effective only if Freud' s emphasis on sexuality and drive expression is retained; it does not account for the ways in which Freud' s later work might undermine such an * ana ysls.5l Thus, on the one hand, Lenin manifested reactive traits (e.g., asceticism) indicative of the need to control urgent sexual impulses. On the other hand, however, Lenin had a remarkable capacity to be decisive in tough situations, and his cognitive orienta- tions, relative to anyone else's, remained unimpaired. What weight, then, to give to these characteristic traits of Lenin?52 If we consider that certain types of defensive and adaptive be- havior can arise as readily from social as from drive conflict, we can say that such behavior serves the purpose of regulating the quantity of novel, unorganized, and otherwise potentially disabling informa- tion. This is a twofold process: there is an inhibiting tendency which by repression or postponement limits the perception of disturbing stimuli, and a reality-testing tendency which enhances perceptions of potentially disturbing but controllable phenomena. In combination this allows for a certain level of freedom to attack a problem which may otherwise seem insurmountable. The problems presented by revolutionary situations become approachable because the ego can focus on and organize solutions in particular areas.53 This alternative 50 Ibid., p. 171. Wolfenstein states further that "displacement and projection are at work, for the revolutionist not only hates this surrogate father but views such authority as hating him...." 51 One way of looking at the problem is that the oedipal conflict suggests the immediacy of a sexual or sensual object, while the unusual intensity which Wolfen- stein says characterized Lenin's behavior implies this even more so; but ego mastery suggests remoteness from a sexual object and motivations which are relatively independent of their instinctual origins. The high level of integrated behavior cannot be accounted for in terms of an unusually strongxoedipal complex. Yet it seems that psychoanalysis provides no other theoretical basis for explaining such revolutionary behavior. One seems compelled to root Lenin's ability to act and his character traits in the circumstances of symptom formation. Thus, Wolfenstein (pp. 14, 168) sees that "much" of the political activity Lenin engaged in was a way of managing repressed impulses and of relieving internal conflicts by working them out in a social context. 52 Obsessives find it difficult to act unless they can justify action by rigid adherence to principle and prescription. It would follow from this that Lenin' s dogmatic adherence to Marxism freed him to act. Thus Wolfenstein's statement (p. 173): "The root characteristics of the ideology serve as the conscious justificatory formula for the individual the token of his management of intense and disruptive feelings. Any challenge to that formula is also a challenge to the tight control the individual has established over himself. Shatter the formula in the person's mind and you shatter his personality as well." 53 The statement above is meant to indicate an approach; it is not meant to</page><page sequence="24">Crisis in Psychohistory 225 explanation of certain questionable features of Lenin' s person- ality which is fair enough becomes possible, however, only when the real social conditions are a part of the analysis and not viewed essentially as external to some prior and more basic problem. The results of the "contradictory signals" in contemporary psychoanalytic theory are then evident. What inspires a man to challenge the world, to proceed with undeviating tenacity to a revolutionary goal in light of normatively defined and personally intolerable conditions? To answer that question in classic psy- choanalytic terms, one must paint a somber picture indeed: "But in the person who is to be a revolutionist both love and hate are felt unusually strongly so that the individual is being psychically torn apart by intense internal con0!ict between his basic drives and the stern strictures of his superego."54 This conflict, however, ml.lst not only be mastered but the mastery must be sustained in the face of the most anxiety-provoking, chaotic events imaginable revolution, civil war, famine. Deriving great strength from great weakness puts more of a burden on the theory than it can sustain, and, as George Klein put it, the theory breaks apart.55 constitute an analysis. However, this type of approach is crucial for a leader like Lenin who, by his own strength, however defined, serves to prevent withdrawal from situations of apparently overwhelming complexity and potential danger and serves also to bridge a transitional period until novel forms of behavior are institutionalized and internalized. In these terms it is necessary to consider also the problem of temporary "regression" as useful and necessary in the face of difficult external conditions. (On distinctions among different types and levels of regression, see Anna Freud, Normality and PathoZogy in Childhood: Assessments of DeveZopment [New York, 1972], pp. 71-73. On hierarchy of defenses see Irving Shuren, "A Contribution to the Metapsychology of the Pre-analytic Patient," Psychoanal. Stud. Child 22 [1967]: 105; and George E. Vaillant, "Theoretical Hierarchy of Adaptive Ego Mechanisms," Archives of General Psychiatry 24 [1971]: 107-18.) Once defensive behavior and adaptive behavior are viewed in these terms, the implication of "neu- rotic" behavior, i.e., behavior that is inappropriate or that is immediately threatened in its integrity because it is based on transference rather than on realistic considera- tions, is bypassed. 54 Wolfenstein, pp. 167-68 (italics added). Coles, in his critical comments on Wolfenstein, picked up on "unusually" as above, in the sense of "how do you measure that?" Wolfenstein did write of developing indices for measuring ambiva- lence, although none exist and Freud, at any rate, thought that none could exist (i.e., "Mental events seem to be immeasurable and probably will always be so"; quoted in Ernest Jones, The Life and Works of Sigmund Freud, 3 vols. [New York, 1957], 2:419). Wolfenstein wrote further that this "combination of feelings, Oedipal ambiva- lence, is common to most men" (p. 167). In Freud's view it was common to all people; there are no unambivalent relationships. Freud did describe one possible instance of such a situation, in his description of mourning processes. But here Freud was discussing an ideal-typical instance, and so in practice his principle would hold. It should also be understood that the more one insists on "unusual" degrees of ambivalence, the harder it becomes to explain integrated behavior in difficult external circumstances. 55 For another interesting example of a possible alternative explanation, this time of</page><page sequence="25">226 Weinstein and Platt VI. A NEW DIRECTION FOR PSYCHOHISTORY The problems with the analysis of Lenin we have reviewed arise from one quite specific source: the use of fixed categories which imply psychological predispositions to specific types of action. However, because each event is a unique event, psychohistorians cannot approach their material with the assumption that any given familial structure or fantasy content will account for a personality type that is bound to act in a given situation in some predetermined way. It is necessary to approach data with a sense of the processual nature of human interaction with the environment rather than in terms of predispositional categories.56 This concept-of process, the focus on ego and reality, and on society as encompassing multiple orientations to reality, is a necessary line of thought for psychohis- tory to pursue. But it is also particularly necessary to reconsider psychoanalytic approaches to personality development which, as presently conceived, are not really adequate to explain the behavior of a revolutionary like Lenin.57 Another sense of personality de- velopment must be formulated, and in the following terms. It may happen, and historically it has happened, that important aspects of personality become dysfunctional as a result of structural changes and strains in a society. These changes and strains create in effect a revolutionary situation from the standpoint of psychic struc- ture. In such a situation, identity must be reorganized and redefined a rather well-known anecdote, see Wolfenstein's statements on Lenin and Trotsky (p. 251) and the comments of Schafer in "The Loving and Beloved Superego" (n. 17 above), p. 174. On the issue of the impossibility of deriving great strength from great weakness, see our theoretical statement on alienation, G. Platt and F. Weinstein, "Alienation and the Problem of Social Action," in The Phenomenon of Sociology} ed. Edward A. Teryakian (New York, 1971), pp. 284-310. 56 This criticism of the use of categorical analysis and characterological predisposi- tions is applicable to sociology as well as psychoanalysis; see, e.g., Clark McPhail, "Civil Disorder Participation: A Critical Examination of Recent Research," Ameri- can Sociological Review 36, no. 6 (December 1971): 1058-73. For an indication of the problems involved in the use of psychoanalytic categories in particular, see the following articles by Martin Wangh: "A Psychogenetic Factor in the Recurrence of War: Preliminary Reflections," Israel Annals of Psychiatry and Related Disciplines 6, no. 1 (1968): 128-33; "A Psychogenetic Factor in the Recurrence of War," Int. J. Psychoanal. 49 (1968): 318-23; and "Some Unconscious Factors in the Psychogenesis of Recent Student Uprisings," Psychoanal. Quart. 41, no. 2 (1972): 207-23. The point here is that there is no psychoanalytic category-and certainly none in drive terms-that can adequately encompass the complexity of historical data. We cannot establish this position here definitively; each interested person will have to confront the material in these terms. 57 There are basically four theories of character development in the psychoanalytic literature (see Peter Blos, "Character Formation in Adolescence," Psychoanal. Stud. Child 22 [1968]: 246-47).</page><page sequence="26">Crisis in Psychohistory 227 to adjust to changed conditions. But the basis on which this redefinition occurs has no structured or - legitimated past in the society-or in the personalities that have developed within the society. Redefinition of identity in such situations cannot therefore be understood to derive simply from the familial past. Personality in these terms must be conceived of as a product of ongoing contem- porary social relationships.58 Moreover, this capacity to define and redefine identity should be seen generally in broader terms than psychohistorians have thus far considered. The primary analytic focus in all events should be on the way people relate to their present environment. It is necessary to stress ego orientations to reality in terms of the situational circumstances of daily life rather than in terms of the ontogenetic- familial background. Furthermore, it is necessary to consider the changing nature of social processes and what this means for images of self and others, as well as for the capacity to maintain or alter the personal bases of decision maliing. And it is necessary to focus attention on the psychic processes central to these contexts of behavior, self-esteem, narcissistic integrity, and identity. People act and react to social pressures because such pressures threaten the adequacy of the ego to master reality; failure to do so directly affects these psychic processes. Psychoanalytically, this means emphasizing object relations and object loss. Sociologically, analysis must be centered in the various institutional organizations people are related to, of course, but especially in the cultural and social standards for action. It is these last social factors that shape common attitudes and, at the same time, make action in society personally meaningful. The emphasis on standards and expectations which shape com- mon attitudes provides us with the basis for the analysis of group and mass phenomena. This becomes sociologically consistent, how- ever, only when people are linked to each other because of their shared normative perceptions of real problems in the social world. No consistent sociological frame of reference can be derived from traditional psychoanalytic theory which emphasizes the universality of fantasy contents, the similarity of drive needs, or a common socialization process within the family. In these last terms, people 58 There have been several social-psychological theorists who have conceived of personality in generally similar terms. These theorists, however, have not integrated ego psychological, drive, and affect concepts as we have done here. See, e.g., George Herbert Mead, Mind, Self, and Society (Chicago, 1934); and Harry Stack Sullivan, The Interpersonal Theory of Psychiatry, ed. Helen S. Perry and Mary L. Gawel (New York, 1953). See also Talcott Parsons, Social Structure and Personality (New York, 1964); and Weinstein and Platt, Psychoanalytic Sociology, chap. 4.</page><page sequence="27">228 Weinstein and Platt are unique-and this is why we stress also the personal meaning of action. People accommodate their own unique resolutions to psychic conflict to the needs or requirements of the group. Thus, an obses- sive person will orient himself by activity and accomplishment, a hysteric by dramatization and symbolizationS a paranoid by explanation.59 It is possible, therefore, to encompass both the Freudian level of conflict, man and society, and the sociologicalr, if one prefers, the Marxist-level of conflict, groups contending within society. On the one hand, this framework provides an empirically sound psychodynamic basis for the explanation of mass behavior which sociological orientations based on interest, rationality7 and con- sciousness have always lacked. On the other hand, it extends the possibility for psychosocial analysis of mass behavior well beyond the customary limits of rigid and intolerant responses of ;;in-groups' to "out-groups" based on projection, denial? and other affective and cognitive forms of distortion. - - 59 See D. A. Schwartz, ';A Re-View of the sParanoid' Concept," Archives of General Psychiatry 8 (1963): 354.
