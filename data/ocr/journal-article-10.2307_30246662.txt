WEBSTER Department of Anthropology University of Arizona Tucson, AZ 85721 KELLEY A. HAYS-GILPIN Navajo Nation Archaeology Department Northern Arizona University Flagstaff, AZ 86011 ABSTRACT New research on Anasazi origins is augmented with data from sandals, bas- kets, and textiles collected at the time when Basketmaker culture was first defined by archaeologists. Relationships among decorative style, technology, and social processes are examined. We discuss (1) the distribution of techno- logical and stylistic features of baskets and textiles to address the question of Anasazi origins, and (2) ways archaeologists can approach an understanding of the artistic expression of social identities by contrasting Basketmaker II and Basketmaker III baskets, textiles, and sandals. RESUMEN Se discuten nuevas observaciones sobre los ortgenes Anasazi basadas en datos obtenidos de sandalias, canastas, y textiles que fueron colectados, aiios atrds, cuando por primera vez los arquedlogos definieron la cultura Basketmaker. Se examinan las relaciones entre estilos decorativos, tecnologia de elaboracidn y procesos sociales. Nosotros discutimos (1) la distribucidn de razgos estilisticos y tecnoldgicos de canastas y textiles para tratar la cuestidn de los ortgenes Anasazi, y (2) la forma como los arquedlogos pueden acercarse a comprender la expresi6n artistica de entidades sociales contrastando las canastas, textiles, y sandalias entre el periodo Basketmaker II y el Basketmaker III. Baskets, textiles, and sandals collected by Earl Morris, A. V. Kidder, Sam Guernsey, and others in the Four Corners region are the stuff of which Basketmaker II was made when first defined by archaeologists. To these early twentieth-century investigators, cultural unity among occupants of widely scattered rock shelter sites was assumed largely on the basis of re- semblances in perishable artifacts (for example, Colton 1939:52-53). Today, current research on Anasazi origins can be augmented using data from these and other old collections. In this article we first examine the question of de- lineating regional cultural variations, and address the origins of Basketmaker people by examining decorative style and technology of baskets and textiles. We then discuss some ways that perishables can express social identities, us- ing examples from Basketmaker II and III sites. 313</page><page sequence="2">314 WEBSTER AND HAYS-GILPIN 016 118 e17 COLORADO 13 Sb ) / .Kanab ' Durango ARIZONA Kayenta 2 I NEW MEXICO Tu c tty Key (1 - 10 on iset) or SWhiteDog Cave 2 Marsh Pass Cave 6 UTAH 3 Sunfloer Cave AR0A s 4 Woodchuck Cave .- 5 Kinboko Cave 1 6 Kinboko Cave 2 + .

Technological details of artifact manufacture are complicated to master, and habitual motor skills acquired and ingrained in youth are cus- tomarily retained through life and passed down to the next generation. Be- cause these behaviors seem more resistant to change than stylistic ones (Arnold 1985:233-236), they may serve as far more reliable indicators of cultural origins and common histories (Adovasio 1986, 1977; Kent 1983). Decoration, in contrast, is easily imitated from afar, and can change rapidly in response to social factors (Hantman and Plog 1982:238). PERISHABLE ARTIFACTS IN BASKETMAKER II For the first part of this study, Webster examined stylistic and techno- logical variability in Basketmaker II textiles and basketry. We note at the outset that the data base for this preliminary study was derived from pub- lished descriptions, and collections have not been examined firsthand; quan- titative data are not uniformly available, and findings are simply stated here in presence/absence terms. Further, because many important Basketmaker II collections such as those from Grand Gulch and Canyon de Chelly have never been described in print, we consider the present data base to be con- spicuously incomplete. We also have little to contribute to the problem of re- fining chronology, since we currently lack the chronological control to ad- equately measure change and variability during this period. We hope to convince other scholars that direct dating of some of the artifacts in question by means of the C-14 accelerator method would be a worthwhile endeavor. In the present discussion, we contrast Basketmaker II sites clustered in the San Juan-Kayenta region of northern Arizona and southern Utah with those located outside this area to the north, east, and west. The fifteen Basketmaker II sites considered by the study are shown in Figure 1. The Kayenta sites we have examined are concentrated in the Marsh Pass and Monument Valley areas and include the type site of White Dog Cave. Non- Kayenta sites include Cave du Pont on the west, Bernheimer Alcove on the north, and the Durango Rock Shelters to the east. Comparisons of baskets and textiles from these regions suggest techno- logical similarities in textiles, significant technological differences in basketry, some degree of stylistic unity overall, and differences in degree of stylistic di- versity. Some patterns are pan-regional, while others are spatially restricted. We take each of these points in turn, then attempt an interpretation. Certain textile and basketry types are ubiquitous at Basketmaker II sites; these include coiled baskets with non-interlocking stitches around a two- rod-and-bundle foundation, twined rabbit fur blankets, and weft-twined</page><page sequence="4">316 WEBSTER AND HAYS-GILPIN bags. The widespread presence of these artifacts helped form the basis for defining a Basketmaker II archaeological "culture area." Kidder and Guern- sey (Nusbaum 1922:65), for instance, were struck by remarkable similarities between the Kayenta area artifacts and those from Cave du Pont, 200 km (125 miles) to the west, and Morris and Burgh (1954:75-78) cited a 70 per- cent correlation of traits between the Kayenta sites and Durango Rock Shel- ters, 160 km (100 miles) to the east. Lipe (1967:116-120) also detailed simi- larities between Kayenta sites and those on the Red Rock Plateau further north. These similarities include (1) types of artifacts constituting site as- semblages, (2) decorative style of these artifacts, and (3) certain behavioral patterns, for example, the mortuary practice of covering the deceased with baskets and oversized twined bags. While useful for discerning gross patterns, emphasis on shared traits has also obscured some real differences in material culture within the region of Basketmaker II settlement. By using White Dog Cave in the Kayenta region as the type site for Basketmaker II and comparing other Basketmaker assem- blages to it, archaeologists have overlooked the stylistic and technological variability that characterized settlement on the Colorado Plateau during Basketmaker II times. It is this variability that provides clues for understand- ing Basketmaker origins. (See Matson 1991 for recent work on this problem.) Coiled baskets, for instance, vary in wall construction technology across the region (Table 1). Coiled basketry with two-rod-and-bundle foundations has been reported from virtually all Basketmaker II sites (for example, Guernsey and Kidder 1921: 60; Morris and Burgh 1941:12). While not oc- curring at early sites north of the Colorado River (Adovasio 1971:104), this is the predominant coiling technique at Mogollon sites such as Tularosa and Cordova Caves (Martin and others 1952). Other variants of coiled basketry structures are almost entirely restricted to Basketmaker II sites located out- side of the Kayenta region. One-rod, one-rod-and-bundle, or half-rod-and- bundle foundations have been reported from Cave du Pont, Sand Dune Cave, Bernheimer Alcove, the Durango Rock Shelters, and Kinboko 1, all but the latter located outside the Kayenta area. These technological variants share affinities with Great Basin and Fremont technologies to the north and west (Morris and Burgh 1954:68; Adovasio 1971:104-6; Hewitt 1980:55). Adovasio (1971:104) speculates that one-rod coiling diffused into the South- west from northern Utah during Archaic times. Spaced or sifter coiling, while described as a local Basketmaker II development (Morris and Burgh 1941:18; Adovasio 1971:106), is likewise reported only from Basketmaker II sites outside the Kayenta area (Cave du Pont and the Durango Rock Shel- ters). (Morris and Burgh 1941:17 report an additional example from a site in East Canyon, north of the San Juan River). Though not reported from Basketmaker II sites within the Kayenta region, these one-rod basketry</page><page sequence="5">New Trails for Old Shoes 317 Table 1.

The incidence of these divergent basketry types varies considerably across the region. At Cave du Pont, Sand Dune Cave, and Bernheimer Al- cove, for instance, these one-rod types comprise only a minor proportion of assemblages in which two-rod-and-bundle basketry predominate (for in- stance, 10 percent at Cave du Pont); in contrast, at the Durango Rock Shel- ters, variants of half-rod and one-rod foundation basketry dominate the site</page><page sequence="6">318 WEBSTER AND HAYS-GILPIN assemblage (95 percent) and only one example of two-rod-and-bundle bas- ketry is reported. While acknowledging important differences between the Durango Rock Shelters and other non-Kayenta sites further west, we observe that as a group, Basketmaker II sites located outside of the Kayenta area show considerably more diversity in basketry technology than those within the Kayenta region; this variability suggests development from a more finely tuned gathering tradition, such as that described for the Great Basin regions of Nevada and Utah. In contrast, within the Kayenta region we find a remarkably uniform basketry tradition, consisting almost exclusively of two-rod-and-bundle foun- dation technology; significantly, it is here that we see considerable diversity in textile artifacts (Table 2).

Although these techniques rarely appear at Basketmaker II sites out- side of the Kayenta area, they are reported from Mogollon sites to the south including Tularosa and Cordova Caves (Kent 1983; Martin 1952). At this point, we attribute these differences to cultural and demographic factors, but recognize that greater chronological control over the artifacts is needed if we are to test these hypotheses in a meaningful way. (For example, we would like to know if one-rod basketry structures are contemporaneous with two-rod-and-bundle structures in sites such as Cave du Pont, Rehab Center, and Bernheimer Alcove. It is possible that earlier Archaic materials were mixed with "true" Basketmaker II materials, thus the co-incidence of structures could be more chronological than cultural.) Here we infer that these patterned differences in basketry and textile technologies signify dif- ferent cultural origins for Basketmaker II people, with Basketmaker II cul- ture representing an intermingling of northern and southern populations within the defined Basketmaker culture area. (For a related discussion in support of the latter argument, see Matson's (1991:311-316) recent work on Basketmaker cultural origins and demographics.) Specifically, technological evidence suggests to us that the White Dog phase sites in the Kayenta region share affinities with Mogollon and Cochise populations to the south, whereas Basketmaker II populations outside this area derive in part from proto-Fremont/ Great Basin Archaic traditions. Regional differences in perishable technologies are paralleled by varia- tions in decorative style. At most Basketmaker II sites we examined, baskets and twined bags were decorated with simple encircling bands. But in the Kayenta region we found decorative systems to be more elaborate and di- verse than those found at non-Kayenta sites. Kayenta basket designs are con- siderably more complicated, and twined bags from the Kayenta region are commonly decorated with more colorful and elaborate geometric designs. Since decoration is often used to express an ideology of unity among people of formerly distinct cultural backgrounds (Wobst 1977:333-334), we might expect decorative style to converge across the entire Basketmaker region, but apparently the White Dog phase Basketmakers developed an elaborate decorative system for their baskets and bags that was not imitated by others. The stylistic unity we do find across the Basketmaker II culture area occurs in rock art, and in certain behavioral patterns such as treatment of the dead. COMPARISON WITH ROCK ART AND INFERENCES ABOUT RELIGION In rock art, some degree of stylistic fusion between northern populations and the Basketmakers of the Kayenta region apparently did take place. The</page><page sequence="8">320 WEBSTER AND HAYS-GILPIN San Juan Anthropomorphic Style (Schaafsma 1980) is found throughout the Basketmaker region. It appears to have northern affinities in that the large, rectilinear, frontally depicted humans have antecedents in Archaic period rock art in Utah, and stylistic diversity in Basketmaker rock art is apparently much greater north of the San Juan. Cole (1989, 1990) attributes this rock art's content to shamanistic beliefs and practices. Although shamanism, as a kind of religion, is widespread, Cole's rock art studies show that a particular iconography associated with Basketmaker shamanism was shared, at least to a degree, over this wide area. Mortuary ritual also suggests a shared belief system for the Basket- makers, but does not reveal much about specific beliefs. Belief in a world- of-the-dead is implied - as is the case in most North American cultures. The Basketmaker dead were dressed in fur robes and interred with tools, medicine pouches, and other personal effects. Some bodies were sewn into large, decorated twined bags. Coiled baskets were placed under the heads of the dead, or inverted over them. Often these baskets were "killed," perhaps to demarcate the portal between this world and the next to allow the spirit to pass through, or to symbolically consign the basket to the world of the dead by converting it from a whole, useable container to a broken, unuseable one. Even though these objects do not carry iconography that is recognizably reli- gious, they show that specific religious practices were apparently shared over a wide area. "Medicine bundles" containing odd-shaped stones, crystals, and feath- ers, found in Basketmaker II sites (Kidder and Guernsey 1919), lend cre- dence to an individualistic component to Basketmaker religion, but are not uniquely Basketmaker. Similar bundles are widespread throughout North America (Gill 1982:163). Ethnographically, some bundles belong to indi- vidual shamans, but others are held communally by sodalities and passed down the generations. Without direct ethnographic ties, there is probably no way to tell which archaeological bundles were made by and for individuals, and which, if any, were communally held and buried as a result of the de- mise of a whole lineage or society. Shamanism is considered to be a religion that stresses individual com- munication with other worlds, individual acquisition of helping spirits, heal- ing, success in hunting, and entry into other realms, such as the realm of the dead (Eliade 1964; Hirschfelder and Molin 1992:260-261). Anthropologists formerly associated shamanism exclusively with hunting and gathering economies and with social values stressing individual achievement - values posited to conflict with the communal, cooperative ones necessary in agricultural societies where religious specialists are priests rather than sha- mans (Lessa and Vogt 1965:451). Use of these "polar types" is no longer current, as the dichotomy greatly oversimplifies the religious life of native</page><page sequence="9">New Trails for Old Shoes 321 peoples. Both shamans and priests, for example, co-exist in the intensively agricultural historic Pueblos, and the duties of some individuals include as- pects of both roles. We cannot assume that prehistoric agriculturalists such as the Basketmakers were limited to one kind of religious practice either. Further research on rock art, mortuary practices, and spatial organization of artifacts and architecture in Basketmaker sites should, over time, help clarify the relationships between individualistic and communal religious activities. BASKETMAKER II SUMMARY In the Kayenta area in Basketmaker II, we find an apparently homog- enous basket technology and a heterogeneous textile technology, both shar- ing affinities to the south. At Basketmaker II sites outside the Kayenta area, we have a heterogeneous basket technology with affinities both to the south and to the Great Basin Archaic, co-occurring with a much simpler textile technology. Decorative expression in baskets and textiles is more diverse and labor-intensive in the Kayenta than at non-Kayenta sites. A rock art style is shared but seems to be more elaborate and intensive in the north, and mor- tuary patterns are shared. These overlapping spheres of technological and stylistic patterns suggest a population with diverse origins that is unified, or becoming unified, by a common ideology as well as a shared agricultural economy. COMPARISON WITH BASKETMAKER III The rest of our study explores the intensification of textile and basket decoration that apparently began in the Kayenta area but became very wide- spread in the Basketmaker III period. This discussion is derived from Hays- Gilpin's (Hays 1992) restudy of material from the Prayer Rock District, northeastern Arizona, a symbolic/contextual analysis of Basketmaker III decorative systems. Previous studies of Basketmaker III culture have em- phasized growth in community size, appearance of community structures sometimes called great kivas, increased reliance on agriculture (or, at least, the addition of beans to the diet), and the appearance of pottery. Another in- triguing change is the increased investment in decoration of artifacts, espe- cially twined sandals, which become technologically complicated and deco- rated with both colored and textured designs. (Inter-site technological and stylistic data for Basketmaker III textiles and basketry are not presently available to permit thorough comparisons between Basketmaker II and III assemblages. The authors concur that further investigation of these changes would be most valuable for elucidating sociocultural aspects of the Basket- maker II - III transition. (For detailed overviews of Basketmaker III textiles and basketry, see Kent 1983 and Morris and Burgh 1941.)</page><page sequence="10">322 WEBSTER AND HAYS-GILPIN Most Basketmaker II sandals are relatively simple, roughly rectangular wicker or twined items, though a great deal of variability occurs. Some san- dals are woven of fine cord and have elaborate fringe added to the toes. Earl Morris (n.d.) noted that the fringe is sometimes so long that it would have made walking difficult. This feature suggests that some sandals were made not simply to protect the foot, but had some social or symbolic role as well. There is clear technological and stylistic continuity between the twined cord sandals of Basketmaker II and III, at least for those of the Kayenta and Can- yon de Chelly areas, and over time, the elaboration of sandals increases dramatically. Sites in the Prayer Rock District were excavated by Earl Morris in 1930 and 1931. Tree ring dates from pit houses delineate two occupation periods. Obelisk, Pocket, and Broken Flute Caves were occupied in the late A.D. 400s. The presence of plain, polished, gray pottery places this occupation in Bas- ketmaker III, or the early ceramic period, but decorated pottery did not appear until the second occupation, in the seventh century A.D. Broken Flute Cave was reoccupied in the late A.D. 620s, and several other sites nearby, Caves 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8 and probably Pocket and Ram's Horn Caves, were occupied in the A.D. 660s through 680s (see E. A. Morris 1959, 1980; Ban- nister and others 1966; Ahlstrom 1985). In contexts dated to the A.D. 480s, Earl Morris found square-toed twined and tapestry weave sandals with elaborate weft-wrapped textured designs on the soles, and tops occasionally decorated with simple colored stripes; he notes that each sandal would have left a unique footprint in the dry dust of the cave floors, as well as when worn outside on fields and trails. Most sandals from contexts dated to the A.D. 600s have scallop-shaped toes; a few have round toes (Deegan 1993:Figs. 3c,e, 4c). Similar scallop-toed twined sandals have been found at Mesa Verde (Nordenskiold 1893:Plate XLVI:6; Rohn 1977:227-229), and in the Kayenta (Guernsey 1931:Plate 9, Plate 47:a-b; Baldwin 1938:465, 1939:224; Cummings 1953:109) and Can- yon de Chelly (Kidder 1926; Morris n.d.) areas. Most have a textured sole, with the texture reserved for the heel and midsole, the part of the sandal leaving the clearest footprint. Midsoles usually have a band of colored deco- ration and very often the toe zone is also decorated. Designs often have four colors, are always symmetrical, and are usually very detailed. According to Leon Lorentzen, University of Arizona archaeologist and former United States border patrol officer (personal communication with Hays-Gilpin 1990), modern law enforcement officers trained in tracking focus on heel prints to identify individual shoes, and mark their own bootheels with carved notches in order to leave unique tracks that identify their whereabouts to other officers. When the Basketmakers added colored designs to the upper surfaces of their sandals, the weaving technique precluded intricate sole tex- turing beneath the colored areas. The fact that heels were left uncolored on</page><page sequence="11">New Trails for Old Shoes 323 the top and textured on the bottom, while the texture on the front part of the sandal was sacrificed, suggests that a tracking function for the heel designs was important. Kidder (1926:632), describing one of these sandals from Canyon de Chelly, says, "The raised patterns of the soles were doubtless serviceable in giving extra wear, and in providing a firm grip on smooth rocks, but the ex- traordinary richness and variety of these, and of the colored decorations as well, can only have been due to pride of workmanship, or to magical be- liefs." This, the last sentence in the article, perhaps implies that further in- vestigation of such beliefs in Basketmaker society is beyond the interest or ability of archaeologists. Despite admonitions from Kidder (1924) against following the "primrose path of speculation," we venture a short way down that path here. Colored designs on the upper surfaces of sandals would not have been visible when the sandal was being worn. It is possible that the designs were meant to be seen in the contexts of giving or receiving sandals, or when san- dals were left in doorways, showing who was inside. It is also possible that these designs were only meant to be seen by the maker and wearer (who might often be the same person). Investment in making these designs could have been a matter of individual self-expression and artistry, including but not limited to Kidder's (1926:632) notion of "pride of workmanship." The considerable investment in these two kinds of decoration on sandals sug- gests that both identification of the sandal and its print were in some way im- portant. Despite a fundamental unity of shape, weaving technique, and color, on close inspection each design is unique or nearly so. A plausible hypoth- esis is that the textured sole designs served to identify the individual or group identify of the wearer, while the colored designs expressed the iden- tity and skill of the maker. As community size increased from Basketmaker II to Basketmaker III, social relationships must have become more complicated. The increase in decorative activity can be viewed as part of a response to what Johnson (1982, 1989) has termed "scalar stress." As more individuals came into daily contact and formed relationships with each other, new relationships be- tween people and property had to be worked out. There is no reason to think of this as a simple, "natural" process; evidence for violence in Basketmaker III is strong. Nor is there reason to assume that everyone in an aggregating community would have spoken the same language or shared the same cul- tural background. Visual arts would have played an integral role in forging unity and emphasizing differences, with signs elaborated not only to signal relationships and identities, but to actively negotiate the meanings of rela- tionships among individuals, families (kin groups), households (economic groups), and communities (residence groups). Colored decoration is especially elaborate on sandals worn by the dead,</page><page sequence="12">324 WEBSTER AND HAYS-GILPIN according to Morris' notes. Increased elaboration in mortuary sandals, which exhibit no use wear, and baskets may point to an increasing emphasis on identification of the individual in the world of the dead, as well as, and perhaps even more than, in the world of the living. A Basketmaker funeral was invested with highly visible signs of group and individual identity - signs that could clearly be read by those in attendance. Possibly we are see- ing an increased emphasis on links between living farmers and their ances- tors, and thus a legitimization of land tenure. CONCLUDING REMARKS Many of the same design elements, layouts, and symmetry categories used in Basketmaker II baskets and especially Basketmaker III baskets and textiles including sandals, appear later in pottery, not only during Basketmaker III, but at least through Pueblo II. If this design style originally developed in a symbolic context, then its persistence over time can be under- stood, and changes that do occur can be examined in a new light. Decorative style may relate to cementing cooperative relationships among people of dis- parate origins, to expressions of gender ideas or roles, or expressions of indi- vidual identities. In any of these scenarios, artifact decoration was not merely idle doodling that simply reflected cultural boundaries, but was ac- complished with some social and ideological goals in mind that gave it great momentum over time.
