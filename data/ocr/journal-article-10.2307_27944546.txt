New York: Praeger, 2009. xiv + 301 pp. $49.95 cloth. (Reviewed by Robert S. Corrington, Drew University) The fifteen essays in this volume are taken from a symposium held in July 2008 at the University of Bologna, with contributions coming from ethology, evolutionary psychology, neuroscience, and anthropology, and with some sophisticated psychology of religion. The essays are of such high caliber and so free of wooden materialism that they are well positioned to invoke or provoke ongoing query. If one simply grows weary of the creationism vs. neo-Darwinian battles, it comes as a liberating moment when you can cast your Darwin-friendly eyes "downward" into the realms where evolutionary traits are observable in a roughly delineated way. Yes, and you can get predictions too. Peirceans will note that these scientists are more than willing to make abductions (hypothesis from law to case, namely, from thirdness giving its blessing to unruly secondness). We need to remind ourselves of the basics. Evolutionary theory asserts that biological life embodies descent with modification. All (random) variations in habit must work almost instantly or the organism and its "inclusive fitness" cohorts will fail to reproduce. Almost all mutations are fatal, and it only brooks confusion to see these changes as somehow "creative" or as mobile little improve ments somehow pleasing to the deity. Teleology got the bums rush some time ago, yet its appeal seems as strong as ever. The burden for evolutionary theory of the human and the religious is that it must secure its worldview without falling into the temptation to "find" something that is purposive in our species/nature interaction. For me, purpose is best discussed within the realms delineated by neo-Platonism; Darwin meets Plotinus as it were. Adaptation as a concept has some anthropomorphic echoes where we might say, "Yes, I will choose to adapt to the new evolutionary microniche." I prefer to say that nature (via our species-being) imposes the narrow band where we adapt or fail to reproduce enough to outpace the death rates in our specific population. It really is more like a key and a lock than as seen in the idealistic/panpsychist framework where both locks and keys coevolve (seamlessly?) together. We have natural selection, adaptation, and sexual selection. Darwin marveled at the astonishing growth in male peacock feathers and did not see how they American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy ? Vol. 32, No. 2, May 2011 ? 2011 by the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois</page><page sequence="2">190 American Journal of Theology and Philosophy were a natural selection or a viable adaptation. The extra feathers were seen as an unnecessary by-product (what today is called a "spandrel"?an epiphe nomenon that rides piggy back on an adaptive structure on its own right). The discovery of the absolute centrality of sexually selected traits enabled Darwin and the rest of us to grasp the astonishing drive toward the high end of genetic pairing. My big peacock tail does take me a bit longer to get airborne, but when it comes to mate selection, I have an even more valuable commodity. Studies have shown that when a female bird selects the sexy partner, she is also getting a partner with the fewest internal parasites and therefore, the strongest immune system, remembering that bad parasites can bring more death to a population than external threats. Religion also functions via natural selection, that is, it makes community inclusion more secure and adaptive as you have to pay a steep price to be ac cepted as one of the in-group, and part of the price is the almost automatic demonization of nonclan members. Identity and violence are part of an ancient species logic that may never be overcome no matter how strenuous our religions' peace-making efforts. Many of the authors are persuaded that religion has been on the side of the devils in our nature, although it can also uphold some modest eschatological visions that may themselves be adaptive in a different way. A controversial twist on this argument has to do with the alleged "evolutionary time lag" hypothesis that asserts that the foundation of our religious behavior goes back to the Pleistocene era (c30.000 BCE) and froze into habit and brain hardwiring at that time. So, the aspect of religion that was necessary for supporting bands of thirty to fifty has actually become a pathogen in the hyperglobal world. To use the Paleolithic mind to shape our own worlds of behavior and ideation is to live in the shadow of adaptation strategies that are now maladaptive. Of late, brain plasticity has drawn a lot of attention, especially when dis cussing the transit from phenotype ?&gt; environment ?&gt; genotype where the phenotype is species/nature imprinted/imprinting. Religion would be caught in an ancient phenotype recursion that would plow over any truly novel mode for being religious. While I don't (usually) side with the devils in our nature, I admit to being impressed with the "time lag" theory as it correctly delineates the fissure in our nature that cannot be fixed within religion. Outside of religion lies the infinitizing power of art which I now see as being constituted by spheres of hyperadaptability. The volumetric growth of the human brain is indeed wondrous, but we are far from having all of the ducks in a (infinite) row. It is becoming clearer that the brain is not simply a self-standing lock and key (now in a different way) but can take cues from the external environment?much of this being studied by MRI</page><page sequence="3">Volume 32, No. 2, May 2011 191 and other devices. The high watermark of brain plasticity occurs in adolescence where affiliations and differences begin the inevitable process of concrescing. I am less persuaded than some that this brief span of literal phenotyping in the ossicilating species-brain can overcome the "time lag" or makes sense in the brutal war-filled transition from our ancient sapiens to a condition, for some, of excessive overcompensations. I'm a middle-class European, say, and I go through my life with the "must have to survive" hard wiring such that I will still over-consume and live in an anxious state or flight state (Reich's "status anxiety") rather than deconstruct my habitual schema of experience and behavior. My Paleolithic brain wants food with very high fat content to keep circulating enough metabolic energy to my musculature so that it can respond fully and immediately to nature's penny-pinching and shifting ways. A number of the authors link the phenomenon of childhood punishments to primitive adaptations that assured the solidity of the community by making pseudocosmic projections onto nature that in turn became introjected. It's a bit like "Feuerbach, bring your whip;" that is, our species-being must be "ex ternally" policed vis-?-vis improper power moves from the Betas of the clan. Alpha to wannabe alpha contests must preserve the genetic and cultural fields so the losers live to try again. Those among us who have studied French thinkers (Sartre, L?vinas, Marion) know that the human gaze is part of an ancient dialect in which self/other con trasts and identities are born and sustained. Well and good. But suppose I argue that the biological structure of ocular othering is located in the white-to-pigment ratio on the human eyeball. When the commander on Bunker Hill shouts, "Don't shoot until you see the white of their eyes," he is being a spokesperson for the semiotic/signaling value of a white horizon surrounding a smaller pupil and iris. Simply put, with our species everyone gets a leg up by seeing the object that the powerful figure is eyeing. If there is no surrounding "empty" semiotic white zone, then the gaze-to-object correlation may not be discoverable. For example, a downward gaze that is presented within a large white eye can be read as a submission gesture. And after millions of years we have learned to negotiate fairly well among our highly codified "looks." Before looking at an example of ocular religiosity, I want to open the door a little wider for more "strictly" philosophical thinkers. Years back I bought into Heidegger's dyad that contrasts (mere) ontic reality with ontological (later, preontological) structures. There is a (founding) leap into the existentials that is not through analogy or the result of ontic inquiry but is more like an express elevator that will not (cannot) stop anywhere short of the lucid self-giving of the enveloping as it gives itself on the peak of the mountain. Alas, Heidegger</page><page sequence="4">192 American Journal of Theology and Philosophy delegates the messiness of the ontic to psychology, anthropology and other "human" disciplines thereby cutting them off from "grounding" mittances of the es gibt. But the so-called ontic messes are precisely what a more capacious and Darwin-friendly form of query must investigate. Now to the concrete example of how the gaze is a key piece in forming reli gious identity. In his stellar essay contribution, "Natural Gazes, Non-Natural Agents: The Biology of Religion's Ocular Behaviors," Thomas B. Ellis argues that there is a fundamental divide between those religions that demand a di verted gaze from the supplicant and Hinduism, which encourages a direct gaze between devotee and god/goddess. This divide can also be seen as a difference between religions of submission and obedience versus Hinduism, which is more like an adult one-on-one mutual gazing; namely, a religion of attachments. In the patriarchal monotheisms, the desideratum is to keep the (challenging) gaze away from Alpha Male frontal stare. A pro-Hindu thinker might aver that Darshan (one-to-one mutual looking) is the only comportment worthy of a religious adult, whereas always averting one's gaze downward both infantilizes us and, tragically, shuts out the radiant power of the Infinite (Parabrahman). I have witnessed the almost instantaneous power of Darshan during my several trips to India. While waiting for the inner sanctum of the Temple to become unveiled by the Brahmin Priest, the energy level builds sharply. The instant the curtain is removed from the statue of the deity, the celebrants burst-forth with horns, cymbals, and drums while pushing up to the front for the Darshan that awaits them. What I witnessed was a remarkable energy flow from disciple to deity and, importantly, from deity to devotee that enfleshed them both within the time process. I have long argued that Hinduism is the best energy mover among the major religions, and this transfer is horizontal because of the Higher Self within that is God, not God inferred or posited by a limp-along analogy. Ellis summarizes: Flat faces and bipedal (two-legged) gait militated against using simple body orientation as an indication of future behavior. Eye direction thus became of paramount importance. Reflecting this importance, the human eye's naturally selected, disproportionately larger sclera (white of the eye) with respect to the size of the iris enables the ability to pay particular attention to the conspecific other's eye direction (41). In the gritty life of food gathering, the sclera of the eye can tell a Beta where the higher conspecifics are looking. If their gaze is away from the food, then it is (momentarily) safe to eat that food. This epistemology-on-the-run attunes each clan member to hierarchy and opportunity vis-?-vis immediate metabolic needs. In conclusion, let me reiterate the high quality of each one of the articles, not only the one focused on. My initial worry was that I would be reading essays</page><page sequence="5">Volume 32, No. 2, May 2011 193 that reduced religion to "nothing but": 1) a rococo style Spandrel with dubious antecedent credentials, 2) just a hierarchal police mechanism, 3) a global war machine, 4) a deadener of liberal theological query, 5) a wounder of healthy narcissism, 6) a runaway effect that gilds the lily by piling on more ersatz but dramatic traits to an already overdrawn and fragile animal psyche, and 7) the eternal foe of art and autonomous (Kantian) creativity that stands on its own legs in affiliation with the sublime and the beautiful. I did not find a single article that indulged in reductionism. I have read a number of articles in evolutionary psychology and found some of them tainted with reductionism vis-?-vis religious phenomena. With this text those rather ham-fisted earlier efforts are transfigured on a higher level. This is a textbook that I shall assign to my students because it gets so much right so many times. One caveat is that the focus on biology puts the theological questions on the sidelines, as it must. For the philosophical theologian, the focus is also on the ontological nature of the referent and on the complexities of the self &lt;? ?&gt; world correlation where genuine sacred folds perennially punctuate our encounters with the heart of nature.</page></plain_text>
