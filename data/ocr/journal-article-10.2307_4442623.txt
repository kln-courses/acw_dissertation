<plain_text><page sequence="1">JUNIOR SCIENCE BOOK OF TREES, Robert S. Lemmon, 62 pp., $2.19, Garrard Publishing Co., Champaign, Illinois, 1968. This is a well-written, interesting volume for the elementary school stu- dent. Although the reading level, ac- 346</page><page sequence="2">cording to the publisher, is third grade, the manner of presentation would be acceptable to an older elementary school child. The illustrations are clear and easy to understand, though they would have been improved had some size indication been included to provide a better idea of relative sizes of dif- ferent trees mentioned. It is un- fortunate that the author has marred an unusually well done and modestly priced volume with an occasional un- necessary anthropomorphism. H. G.</page></plain_text>
