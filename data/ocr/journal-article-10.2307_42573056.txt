<plain_text><page sequence="1">Walter Blair Mark Twain's Other Masterpiece: "Jim Baker's Blue-Jay Yarn" Walter Blair I. "At His Best and Brightest" Grizzled Jim Baker, the lone dweller in a deserted California mining camp, begins a story about favorite woodland neighbors by summing up his scientific findings during seven years: "There's more to a blue-jay than any other creature. He has got more moods, and more different kinds of feelings than other creatures; and mind you, whatever a blue -jay feels, he can put into language. And no mere commonplace language, either, but rattling, out-and-out book-talk- and bristling with metaphor, too- just bristling! And as for command of language- why, you never see a blue-jay stuck for a word. No man ever did. They just boil out of him! And another thing: I've noticed a good deal, and there's no bird, or cow, or anything that uses as good grammar as a blue -jay. You may say a cat uses good grammar. Well, a cat does- but you let a cat get excited, once; you let a cat get to pulling fur with another cat on a shed, nights, and you'll hear grammar that will give you the lockjaw. Ignorant people think it's the noise which fighting cats made that is so aggravating, but it ain't so; it's the sickening grammar they use. Now I've never heard a jay use bad grammar but very seldom; and when they do, they are as ashamed as a human; they shut right down and leave."1 Bernard DeVoto thought "Jim Baker's Blue-Jay Yarn," an interlude in A Tramp Abroad (1880), typified Mark Twain's humor in part because of the way it combined fantasy and reality. Baker's furred and feathered friends not only talk but achieve levels of diction, metaphors, and even grammar. But Baker, "a creation from the world of reality," DeVoto says, is born not of fantasy but of "the sharp perception of an individual." "Fantasy," he concludes, "is thus an instrument of realism and the humor of Mark Twain merges into the fiction that is his highest reach."2 Critics of several persuasions saw Baker's yarn as what W. E. Henley called it in an early review of A Tramp Abroad , Twain "at his best and brightest, . . . delightful as mere reading [and] of a high degree of merit as literature."3 DeLancey Ferguson, for example, thought it stood out in a book which "contained phrases and passages that were Mark Twain at his best," and added, "were one asked to choose from all Mark Twain's works the most perfect example of the genuine Western tall tale, patiently and skillfully built up . . . the choice would come down at last" to this story.4 132</page><page sequence="2">A case can be made for the claim that, just as Huckleberry Finn is the greatest of Twain's longer comic works, "Blue-Jay Yarn" is the greatest of the shorter ones. Although it does not have the depth, the scope, or the variety of the novel, it is equally characteristic, and judged on its own terms it is in some ways superior: it has fewer flaws and greater unity. Besides, it is delightfully funny. So it is worth a close look. The story's background partly accounts for its pre-eminence and helps one define its genre. Story-telling sessions with some masters of the art in the winter of 1864-65 helped the humorist not only discover the substance of the yarn but rediscover the form that was appropriate for it. Later practice and analysis helped him give the written narrative qualities that- quite rightly- he prized. And literary traditions and models also in important ways contributed to its excellence. II. Calaveras County Bonanza During the years before he went West in 1861, Sam Clemens constantly heard stories told well. His mother, an "obscure little woman" with an "enchanted tongue," he called "the most eloquent person" he ever met. Ned, his father's slave, told "The Golden Arm" story which Twain retold year after year to lecture audiences. On the Missouri farm where he spent boyhood summers, he enjoyed his uncle's storytelling; at night in the Quarters he heard Uncle Dan'l "telling the immortal tales which Uncle Remus Harris was to . . . charm the world with, by and by." (Dan'l effectively prepared childish listeners for jimdandy nightmares by unloosing a bloodcurdling ghost story just before he sent them to bed.) During Sam's Wanderjahren, fellow jour printers and steamboatmen were memorable yarnspinners.5 He grew up when American humorists were trying to catch in print the substance and the manner of oral yarns. At his printer's case in Hannibal and elsewhere he set up their writings; in his leisure hours he read them. At about the time he went West, however, new styles of writing became fashionable. Many comic journalists replaced rustic yarnspinning with word-play, topsy-turvy sentences, parodies and burlesques.6 Writing for the Virginia City Territorial Enterprise and for San Francisco newspapers, Twain ground out comedy of the sort currently popular.7 Throughout the rest of his life, he would often- too often- write Phunny Phellow humor of diction. But a visit to the California mining country reacquainted him with the stuff and the style of fireside storytelling that shaped many of his best writings. Clemens, a twenty-nine-year-old San Francisco journalist, peeved officials by publishing feisty expos√©s. When he found it expedient to absent himself a while, Jim Gillis, pocket miner out in the area where 133</page><page sequence="3">Baker lived, asked him to be a guest. Between 4 December 1964 and 25 February 1865 the budding author stayed with Gillis and his partner, Jim Stoker, in a Jackass Hill cabin or bunked in a nearby Angel's Camp hotel. The region once had swarmed with goldseekers, but the rich diggings had played out, and now only a few desultory pocket miners dotted fields, hills, and forests. Clemens did a little pocket mining without luck and was kept from doing more by a rainy season which- even for a state where what natives call Unusual Weather flushes houses down hills- was worse than usual. He, his hosts, and soggy neighbors huddled for hours around the cabin fireplace or the hotel bar-room stove. His notebook jottings gripe about endless deluges and the "beans and dishwater" monotonously served by the hotel's French restaurateur. He complains that "4 kinds of soup which he furnishes to customers only on great occasions ... are popularly known among the Boarders as Hellfire, General Debility, Insanity and Sudden Death." The booze must have been as corrosive: in a plaint that has the poignancy of a personal reminiscence, Clemens holds that a shot of the tavern's straight whiskey "will throw a man a double somerset and limber him up like boiled macaroni before he can set his glass down."8 All the same, looking back, he would call this area a "serene and reposeful and dreamy and delicious sylvan paradise" where he had "a fascinating and delightful time." He fondly remembered dates with the Eves of this Eden, a miner's pneumatic daughters whom he called "the Chapparal Quails."9 More important, every few years during more than four decades, he praised the purveyors of the chief entertainment aside from drinking, the mining camp yarn-spinners, analyzed their artistry, and at the top of his form imitated them and retold their stories. There is support for the guess several scholars have made that the mining country visit, because of the impact of those storytelling orgies in Jim Gillis's Jackass Hill cabin and the Angel's Camp caravanserie, brought a turning point in the author's career. The very first sketch he published after he got back to San Francisco had as its best and chief ingredient a vernacular monologue by one of the Angel's Camp crowd.10 One evening he told anecdotes to a group of fellow reporters so well that they lost all track of time. Within months he decided that he had a "call" to "drop all trifling ... &amp; strive for a fame" by cultivating his "talent for humorous writing."11 Soon after this discovery of his vocation, he published one of the tales that he had heard "around the tavern stove"-"the germ," as he put it, "of my coming good fortune," a piece of writing that "became widely known in America, India, China, England- and the reputation it made for me . . . paid me thousands and thousands of dollars. . . ." 12 The story furnished the chief part of the title of Twain's first book, and though 134</page><page sequence="4">he infrequently revised any piece once it had been printed, he carefully- and substantially- revised this one three times. Other retellings of California mining camp yarns came out in 1865, 1867, 1871, 1880, 1884, 1893, and 1907. L' The cream of what turned out to be a bumper crop was the "Blue-Jay Yarn" on eleven pages of A Tramp Abroad , published in 1880 when the author paused part way through the writing of Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. The "lovable" personality and the skill of the original teller of this story in the Mother Lode country doubtless helped Twain see its merit. This was Jim Gillis, "gray as a rat, earnest, thoughtful, slenderly educated, slouchily dressed and clay-soiled," but "a gallant creature" whose "style and bearing could make any costume regal ... a man, and a whole man." "A much more remarkable person than his family and his intimates ever suspected," Jim in the humorist's opinion was a genius- "a born humorist, and a very competent one" who "would have been a star performer if he had been discovered, and had been subjected to a few years training with a pen." Twain identified Jim, who he thought was the best raconteur in the diggings, as the originator of three of his mining camp tales, though one of them almost certainly was told by Jim's partner. The writer's notebook jottings, his characterizations of the tellers, and his vivid picturings in memoirs and in the stories themselves justify the other attributions. When inspired, Jim stood with his back to the fire, unleashed his imagination, and spun yarns. Each was a gaudy lie created as he went along but soberly told as "history undefiled." Usually he made his "pard" Stoker the incongruous hero, and Stoker sat smoking, listening solemnly but amiably to his "monstrous fabrications." One of the stories that Twain retold celebrated Stoker's prodigious cat, Tom Quartz, a beast that "had never existed," Twain said, "outside of Jim Gillis's imagination." Another was "Jim Gillis's yarn about the blue jays"- "a charming story, a delightful story, and full of happy fancies."14 When he theorized about oral story-telling and a writer's adaptation of its ways, he found Jim Gillis a useful teacher. III. A "High, Delicate Art" Adapted Twain would call the oral story as Gillis told it "high and delicate art," and would find "no merit in ninety-nine out of a hundred [stories] except the merit put into them by the teller's art."15 He deliberately tried to use that art in his books. But he repeatedly said that written art had to modify the ways of oral storytelling. If an author merely set down the golden words of a fine storyteller, a funny thing happened on the way to the printer: they turned to dross. Clemens 135</page><page sequence="5">prohibited publication of an interview he gave because quoting talk in print is "an attempt to use a boat on land or a wagon on water."16 He decided that careful artistry alone could give printed words the sound of free-and-easy speech. "I amend dialect stuff by talking and talking and talking it till it sounds right."17 Measures like those he took to give painstakingly memorized platform monologues the qualities of off-the-cuff utterances helped him write colloquial passages- "a touch of indifferent grammar flung in here and there, apparently at random" but in fact shrewdly deployed; "heaving in ... a wise tautology"; "sprinkl[ing] in one of those happy turns on something that has previously been said."18 The chief incongruity in the two hundred word opening paragraph of Baker's story- between fulsome praise of book-talk and grammar and abysmal ignorance about both- is made apparent by only four assorted- and strategically placed- grammatical mishaps. And the paragraph illustrates "wise tautology" by reiterating half a dozen times the belief that a jay can express whatever it feels. Twain lauded Gillis for "build [ing] a story as it goes along, careless of whither it is proceeding, enjoying each fresh fancy as it flashes ffom the brain." In "How to Tell a Story," he held that the very basis of the American art was "to string incongruities and absurdities together in a wandering and purposeless way."19 He downgraded jokes with payoff lines, praised stories with "pervasive" humor which, like that of William Dean Howells, "flows softly all around about and over."20 So his aim was to ape in print the leisurely imagining and inundating humor of Gillis and other experts. Twain makes "The Blue-Jay Yarn" seem to meander, for one thing, by prefacing it with an apparent unhurried digression of his own, then by having Baker sidle into his monologue at his leisure. The humorist, a continent and an ocean away from the Mother Lode country, strolls into the woods above the Neckar. Soon, remembering German legends that he has been reading about the area, he falls "into a train of dreamy thought about animals which talk, and kobolds, and enchanted folk." Later, lost and alone in the dense silent woods, he fancies that he glimpses some of these creatures in the shadows under the trees. Suddenly the quiet is shattered by the croak of a raven staring down from a branch at the intruder. A second bird comes along: The two set side by side on the limb and discussed me as freely and offensively as two great naturalists might discuss a new kind of bug. . . . They called in another friend. This was too much. I saw that they had the advantage of me, and so I concluded to get out. . . . They enjoyed my defeat as much as any low white people could have done. They craned their necks and laughed at me (for a raven can laugh, just like a 136</page><page sequence="6">man), they squalled insulting remarks after me as long as they could see me. . . . When even a raven shouts after you, "What a hat!" "O, pull down your vest!" and that sort of thing, it hurts you and humiliates you, and there is no getting around it with fine reasoning and pretty arguments.21 The confrontation leads Twain to recall the man who could understand birds and animals- Jim Baker. Baker's background and some of his opinions are detailed. Only after this preamble- one that at first glance appears to be very loosely related- does Baker's monologue start with the remarks about the great skill with which jays communicate. In a passage a bit longer than the first, and therefore an apparent over-elaboration, Jim next argues that "a jay is just as much a human as you be" by mentioning sundry human traits and ("wisely tautological") repeating the claim several times: "You may call a jay a bird. Well, so he is, in a measure-because he's got feathers on him, and don't belong to no church, perhaps; but otherwise he is just as human as you be. And I'll tell you for why. A jay's gifts, and instincts, and feelings, and interests, cover the whole ground. A jay hasn't got any more principle than a Congressman. A jay will lie, a jay will steal, a jay will deceive, a jay will betray; and four times out of five, a jay will go back on his solemnest promise. The sacredness of an obligation is a thing which you can't cram into no blue-jay's head. Now on top of all this, there's another thing: a jay can out-swear any gentleman in the mines. You think a cat can swear. Well, a cat can; but you give a blue-jay a subject that calls for his reserve-powers, and where is your cat? ... Yes, sir, a jay is everything that a man is. A jay can cry, a jay can laugh, a jay can feel shame, a jay can reason and plan and discuss, a jay likes gossip and scandal, a jay has got a sense of humor, a jay knows when he is an ass just as well as you do- maybe better. If a jay ain't human, he better take in his sign, that's all. The impression that Baker is loquacious is heightened by the introduction here of a different type of comedy. These remarks, proving as they do that his birds are human chiefly by arguing that they are depraved in as many ways as human beings are, have the bite of satire. Twain would have said that Jim's equating of humanity with total depravity, in addition to "wandering in an apparently purposeless way," introduces an important component. "It takes a heap of sense to write good nonsense," he told himself in a note shortly before he wrote the blue -jay yarn.22 As an oldster, he would marvel at the way his humor outlasted that of more than eighty popular contemporaneous humorists, thus living "forever." ("By forever," he explained, "I mean thirty years.") His explanation: "I have always preached."23 The humorist was repeating a judgment of his best 137</page><page sequence="7">friend, Howells, who said that "what finally appeals to you in Mark Twain ... is his common sense."24 The way the tale that follows is unfolded reinforces the impression that it wanders since- simple though it is- it (in Twain's phrase) seemingly "fools along and enjoys elaboration" for almost thirteen hundred words. It does not, in fact, detour: each of two parts illustrates a claim Baker makes as he starts his monologue. Part one: Baker describes the comic doings of some jays around a deserted log house near his cabin. One finds a knot-hole in the roof and decides to fill it with acorns. Though he dumps in huge numbers, since the house is "just one big room," he fails. The bird becomes increasingly frantic, frustrated, outraged; and his more and more eloquent orations prove that "whatever a blue -jay feels, he can put into language." Part two: Attracted by his commentaries, first one, then more jays gather and discuss the phenomenon. Finally one learns what the trouble is and announces his discovery. Thereupon greater and greater numbers of birds fly in, study the scene, and jeer about the frustrated jay's mistake. The reactions prove that jays are "just as human as you be." When he makes this uncomplicated fable laughable, Twain proves that the effect of a humorous story depends less upon matter than on manner, in a printed story as well as an oral one, if the author of the printed version adapts oral procedures. IV. Literary Influences Writings as well as oral storytellers of course shaped the blue-jay yarn. A beast fable, this narrative is in a genre that had amused audiences, literally, for ages. Even before Aesop, its beginnings, like Aesop himself, are hidden in the mists of antiquity, and from those beginnings to the present, the form has flourished. A few outstanding practitioners were Hesiod, Aristophanes, and Socrates in the ancient world; Chaucer and myriads of anonymous celebrators of Reynard the Fox in the Middle Ages; Robert Henryson and William Caxton in the fifteenth century; Francois Rabelais in the sixteenth; Jean de la Fontaine (twelve books; "I use Animals to teach Mankind") and Sir Roger L'Estrange in the sevententh; Jonathan Swift, John Gay, Gotthold Ephriam Lessing, Bernard Mandeville, Matthew Prior, William Cowper, Johann Wolfgang Goethe, and Benjamin Franklin in the eighteenth; Leo Tolstoi, Ivan Krylov, Rudyard Kipling, Trilussa (C. A. Salustra), Guy Wetmore Carryl, and others in the nineteenth. Since (as scholars have proved) Clemens read widely, he knew several of his remote predecessors in the anthropomorphic field. About the time he wrote Baker's yarn, his reading had helped him remember or discover three 138</page><page sequence="8">Americans working in the genre in the 1880s. As co-editor of a forthcoming anthology- Mark Twain's Library of Humor (1888)- he was jotting down in Notebooks 15 and 16 lists of possible inclusions. Four times he mentioned George T. Lanigan (1846-1886) or his World's Fables, and the anthology would include seven of Lanigan's pieces. Twice he named Ambrose Bierce; one entry recalled fables published in a newspaper as many as thirteen years earlier; and the anthology had seven of Bierce's fables, at the time still uncollected. In Bierce's "The Robin and the Woodpecker," the latter bird admits that he does not know why he pecks holes in a dead tree: "Some naturalists affirm that I hide acorns in these pits; others maintain that I get worms out of them." Alert source-hunters will notice the bird's theoretical kinship with Baker's blue-jay, which dumped acorns into his knot-hole for reasons that never were clarified. They also may be interested in the fact that at one time when he talked about his story long after he wrote it, Twain called it "a tale of how the poor and innocent woodpeckers tried to fill up a house with acorns."25 "Uncle Remus (?) writer of colored yarns," another notebook entry, Clemens made before the yarns had appeared between hardcovers and, evidently, before he had learned that the creator's name was Joel Chandler Harris. Clemens and his co-editors included two of Harris's narratives in their anthology; he read Harris's tales to audiences, corresponded with him, swapped stories, arranged meetings, called him "a fine genius," and even tried to get the shy little man to share lecture platforms. It seems possible that partly because he so admired Harris and, like him, as a boy had heard Black storytellers tell animal legends, he did well when he exploited what Harris called "that incongruity of animal expression that is just human enough to be humorous" in the "Blue-Jay Yarn."26 Several passages in Jim Baker's story are enriched by comic linkings between bird and animal- for instance the jay's discovery of the hole: "He cocked his head to one side, shut one eye and put the other one to the hole, like a possum looking down a jug"; or the dog-like gesture showing the jay's puzzlement: "he took a thinking attitude . . . and scratched the back of his head with his right foot." (A kinship- perhaps something more- is indicated when one compares a passage in "Uncle Remus Initiates the Little Boy," the first Uncle Remus story and one included in Twain's anthology: "Den Brer Rabbit scratch on one year wid his off hine-foot sorter jub'usly. . . .") More incongruities are of the sort Harris mentioned- between bird and humans. After he drops the first acorn into the hole, the jay "was just tilting his head back with the heavenliest smile on his face, when all of a sudden he was paralyzed into a listening attitude and that smile faded gradually out of his 139</page><page sequence="9">countenance like breath off'n a razor,27 and the queerest look of surprise took its place. ... He cocked his eye at the hole again, and took a long look; raised up and shook his head; stepped around to the other side of the hole, and took another look from that side; shook his head again." His puzzlement grows; so does his anger: "He fetched another acorn, and done his level best to see what become of it, but he couldn't. . . . Then he begun to get mad. He held in for a spell, walking up and down the comb of the roof and shaking his head and muttering to himself ; but his feelings got the upper hand of him, presently, and he broke loose and cussed himself black in the face. I never see a bird take on so about a little thing." Now he decides that he'll be damned if he doesn't fill that hole if it takes a hundred years, and for two hours and a half, he heaves in acorns without stopping: "Well at last he could hardly flop his wings, he was so tuckered out. He comes a-drooping down, once more, sweating like an icepitcher, drops his acorn in and says, 4 Now I guess I've got the bulge on you by this time!' So he bent down for a look. If you'll believe me, when his head come up again he was just pale with rage. He says, 'I've shoveled acorns enough in there to keep the family thirty years, and if I can see a sign of one of 'em, I wish I may land in a museum with a belly full of sawdust in two minutes!' " The culmination of his frantic efforts and of his frustration is accompanied by his greatest flight of eloquence: "He just had strength enough to crawl up on to the comb and lean his back agin the chimbly, and then he collected his impressions and begun to free his mind. I see in a second that what I had mistook for profanity in the mines was only jyst the rudiments, as you may say." In addition to the animalization or the humanization of birds, the story as Baker tells it amuses because of its comic picturings. Incongruities, as Max Eastman has noticed,28 are stressed when they are made highly concrete. Twain creates pictures because, as Howells says, "he is the impassioned lover, the helpless slave of the concrete:"29 the jay peering into the knot-hole, shaking his head, cussing himself black in the face, turning pale with rage, taking a thinking attitude, and leaning his back agin the chimbly attest to this slavery. There are more humanizations and bodyings forth in the second movement of the story. A jay passing by hears the baffled bird "doing his devotions," stops, learns the reason, and calls in other jays: 140</page><page sequence="10">"They called in more jays; then more and more, till pretty soon the whole region 'peared to have a blue flush about it. There must have been five thousand of them; and such another jawing and disputing and ripping and cussing, you never heard. Every jay in the whole lot put his eye to the hole and delivered a more chuckle-headed opinion about the mystery than the jay that went there before him. They examined the house all over, too." The figurative comparison to "a blue flush" helps make this vivid, joining earlier figures to give substance and a comic quality to the proceedings and to justify Baker's aper√ßu that a jay's language, sharing a conspicuous merit with written as well as oral American humor, just bristles with figures of speech. In the final paragraphs, after the old jay solves the mystery and announces his findings, his fellow jays become "a blue cloud," manifest vividly additional human traits, and prove their sense of humor is superior to an owl's: "They all came a-swooping down like a blue cloud, and as each fellow lit on the door and took a glance, the whole absurdity of the contract that the first jay had tackled hit him home and he fell over backwards suffocating with laughter, and the next jay took his place and done the same. "Well, sir, they roosted around here on the house-top and the trees for an hour, and guffawed over that thing like human beings. It ain't no use to tell me a blue-jay hasn't got a sense of humor, because I know better. And memory too. They brought jays here from all over the United States to look down that hole, every summer for three years. Other birds too. And they could all see the point, except an owl that come from Nova Scotia to visit the Yo Semite, and he took this thing in on his way back. He said he couldn't see anything funny in it. But then, he was a good deal disappointed about Yo Semite, too." DeVoto felt that the last sentences "mar the effect of a passage in pure humor" because "they strain toward a joke, escaping from the clear medium of the tale itself into burlesque." Those who have heard an audience respond to the recitation of the sentences by a master- a Hal Holbrook, say- may disagree. Blemish or not, the sentences (as DeVoto adds) are typical of Mark Twain. And their mingling of horseplay with delicate fancifulness is typical of both printed and oral American tall tale humor. V. "The Principle of Life" An exchange between Clemens and Joel Chandler Harris indicates that the humorist might well claim that this discussion so far has failed to deal 141</page><page sequence="11">with the chief aim of this story. Clemens had complimented Harris on his picturing of Uncle Remus as he told Negro folktales to a boy on an antebellum Georgia plantation. Harris, as modest as he was shy, protested that the folktales were far more important than characterization: "my relations toward Uncle Remus are similar to those that exist between an almanac maker and a calendar." Nonsense, Clemens answered, "the principle of life" was in the frameworks. The enclosed tales were only alligator pears- one merely eats them for the sake of the salad dressing. Uncle Remus is most deftly drawn, and is a lovable and delightful creation; he, and the little boy, and their relations with each other, are high and fine literature, and worthy to live for their own sakes; and certainly the stories are not to be credited with them. 30 Granted that Clemens overstated, he was sincere in praising an achievement that he admired and tried to duplicate: the using of a framework to make up for attritions- over and above those previously discussed- that an oral story suffers when it is reduced to print. When Clemens refused to let that interviewer publish an accurate transcript of an interview he had granted, he explained that he did so because an immense something has disappeared from it. That is its soul . . . everything that gave that body warmth, grace, friendliness and charm and commended it to your affections- or, at least, to your tolerance- is gone and nothing is left but a pallid, stiff and repulsive cadaver. Such is "talk" almost invariably, as you see it lying in state in an "interview." The interviewer seldom tried to tell one how a thing was said; he merely puts in the naked remark and stops there. When one writes for print his methods are very different. ... He loads, and often overloads, almost every utterance of his characters with explanations and interpretations. . . . Now, in your interview . . . you have not a word of explanation; what my manner was at several points is not indicated. Therefore, no reader can possibly know where I was in earnest and when I was joking; or whether I was joking altogether or in earnest altogether. Such a report of a conversation has no value. 31 A fiction writer, this implies, has the obligation of so representing his listener and his storyteller as to relate them to the story. Somehow, by showing the pair in action and reaction, an artist must clarify such matters as why the one hearkens to a long-winded monologue and why the other gives it the substance and form he does. Somehow, too, the writer must simulate what Twain called "the spontaneity of a personal relation, which contains the very essence of interest." 142</page><page sequence="12">The "Mark Twain" who listens to the jay story, and enjoys it and repeats it in toto is characterized by the long first person account of his ramblings in the Black Forest and his recollection of a far away friend. He is a relatively complex and ingratiating person- a fact that is made clear when one compares him with the "Mark Twains" who were auditors for a couple of other mining camp story tellings. One of these "Mark Twains," gifted with as little humor, say, as a Canadian owl, is steered by a practical joker into the clutches of a monologist who mercilessly corners him and bores him to death with what he feels are irrelevant maunderings, but which are actually hilarious, before he gratefully escapes. He gives his account because he is outraged. The other "Mark Twain" has his curiosity raised to a fever heat by jocose miners. He therefore listens eagerly to a long-winded chatterbox who barely mentions his subject but spins out (very funny) irrelevancies till whiskey overcomes him, he falls asleep, and his listener at long last learns that he has been hoaxed.32 By contrast the Black Forest "Mark Twain" has humor and understanding. He relishes the "deep and mellow twilight" and the silence of the pine wood; he has enjoyed the German M√§rchen; he imagines that he glimpses "small flitting shapes here and there down the columned aisles of the forest." When the ravens jaw at him, he can relish their insults and joke about the way "the thing became more and more embarrassing." His amused and amusing account of his adventures has shown why he can hear Jim Baker's monologue with delight, remember it, and at a much later date lovingly repeat it verbatim. He has prepared the reader for his mock-solemn claims that animals talk to each other, that Jim is the one man he has known who can understand them, and whimsical proof: "I knew he could . . . because he told me so himself." Jim, like his auditor, benefits when compared with his counterparts in the two Mother Lode stories mentioned above. Both of the other story-tellers are non-stop babblers simply because they are cursed with total recall and are allergic to relevance. Besides, one of them is "tranquilly, serenely, symmetrically drunk- not a hiccup to mar his voice, not a cloud upon his brain thick enough to obscure his memory." By contrast, Jim is loquacious because he has an appreciative audience; he has endless leisure; and his way of living has given him his awe-struck reverence for birds which most normal people find completely unlovable. The biography of this "middle-aged, simple-hearted miner" shows how he discovered that jays can talk and he can understand them. He has been pushed by solitude into a strange companionship that he fondly recalls and celebrates at length. He "had lived in a lonely corner of California, among the woods and mountains, a good many years, and has studied the ways of his only neighbors, the beasts and the birds." Finally- to put it more 143</page><page sequence="13">bluntly than his compassionate portrayer does- this hermit has become a mite touched in the head. Seemingly random sentences give pertinent evidence: "Seven years ago, the last man in the region but me moved away. There stands his house- been empty ever since. . . ." And a bit later: "Well one Sunday morning I was sitting out here in front of my cabin with my cat, taking the sun, and looking at the blue hills, and listening to the leaves rustling so lonely in the trees. . . ." The statistics, and the pathetic fallacy of "lonely" leaves are doubly poignant because they are unobtrusive. Equally unstressed is the casual relationship between the recluse's history and (1) a misanthropy that equates the birds' prodigious orneriness with human-ness, and (2) admiration for creatures that eloquently curse a thwarting world and that band together to jeer damfoolishness. Not surprisingly, he fantasizes about these kin-birds, and as DeVoto says, "His patient, explanatory mind actually works before our eyes and no one can doubt him."33 Awareness of one of the humorist's favorite devices may help the reader to notice a final touch in his portrayal of Baker. For years, Twain had been making use of counterpoint-repetitions with meaningful modulations: While writing A Tramp Abroad , he cited one use of the device and its effect. He would, he said, place cheek-by-jowl "a perfectly serious description of 5 very bloody student duels which I witnessed in Heidelberg" and a broadly burlesqued account of a pretentious but completely harmless French duel. "The contrast," he predicted, "will be silent but eloquent comment."34 Another echoing with variations comes in "Blue-Jay Yarn" when the account of the jeering at "Mark Twain" by raucous ravens is followed by Baker's account of the jeering at the befooled blue-jay by other jays. But note the contrast: Whereas the victim richly elaborates on "Twain's" droll humiliation and abject retreat, Baker says not a word about the mental state, the retorts or the behavior of his embarrassed protagonist. This chief character, in fact, at this point vanishes from the story. The "silent but eloquent comment" that this contrast suggests is: So completely has Jim Baker identified with a woodland neighbor who, like him, has been defeated and, unlike him, has beautifully and directly voiced his feelings, that he skips any report on the jay's humiliation. A way of talking, telling a story, thinking and fantasizing that is delightful and funny thus is made probable by a characterization of Jim Baker which is complex enough to encompass a heartwarming touch of pathos.35 T he University of Chicago 144</page><page sequence="14">NOTES 1 Mark Twain, A Tramp Abroad (Hartford: American Publishing Company, 1880), pp. 36-37 .

Social satire, realistic low life characterization and highly imaginative fantasy in combinations occur in much American humor. 5 Fred W. Lorch, The Trouble Begins at Eight (Ames: Iowa State University Press, 1968), pp. 10-12, gives a good summary. 6Walter Blair, "Introduction," Native American Humor (San Francisco: Chandler, 1960), pp. 38-124. 1 Ibid., pp. 147-150; Edgar Branch, The Literary Apprenticeship of Mark Twain (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1950). 8Most accounts of the stay are gathered in Mark Twain's Frontier, ed.

Clemens said that the "high praise" of his writings by Eastern editors brought his decision. 12 Mark Twain's Letters, I, 170. 13 "An Unbiased Criticism" appeared in March 1865. "Jim Smiley and His Jumping Frog," later "The Celebrated [or Notorious] Jumping Frog of Calaveras County," first appeared 18 November 1865 and was frequently reprinted; it was revised in 1867, 1872 and 1875. Versions of "The Great Landslide Case," which the humorist evidently heard told orally for a second time during his pocket mining days, appeared in the Buffalo Express 2 April 1870 and as Chapter 34 of Roughing It (1872). "Jim Blaine and His Grandfather's Old Ram," Chapter 53, and "Dick Baker's Cat," Chapter 61, of Roughing It were other mining camp tales. The year 1880 brought the blue-jay yarn; 1884 "The Royal Nonesuch," a story originally told, apparently, by Stoker but attributed by Clemens much later to Gillis, in Adventures of Huckleberry Finn , Chapter XXIII; 1893 brought "A Californian's Tale" and 1907 the lecture circuit version of the old ram story. The frog story, the ram story and the blue-jay yarn were included in Mark Twain's Library of Humor (1888), an anthology he helped compile. 14 Eruption, pp. 283-284, 358-366. 15"How to Tell a Story," Youth's Companion, 3 October 1895; Definitive Edition, 263-270; Ernest J.

The frog story was an example, the ram story a more extreme one. In Life on the Mississippi (1883), Chapter XIII, he gave a sample of the art of Brown, who "could not forget anything." Huck tells a rambling history of English royalty in Adventures of Huckleberry Finn , Chapter XXIII. In "How to Tell a Story," Twain nominates as "about the funniest thing I have ever listened to" James Whitcomb Riley's impersonation of an old farmer "who gets all mixed up and wanders hopelessly round and round" as he tries to tell an ancient joke. 20"William Dean Howells," Definitive Edition, XXVI, 228-238. 21 Tramp Abroad, p. 35 . The humorist liked these birds so well that, carrying them to India and calling them Indian crows, he put them into Following the Equator (1897): "If I sat on one end of the balcony, the crows would gather on the railing at the other end and talk about me; . . . they would sit there, in the most unabashed way, and talk about my clothes, and my hair, and my complexion, and probable character and vocation and politics, and how I came to be in India . . . and how I had happened to go unhanged so long . . . and so on, until I could no longer endure the embarrassment of it. . . ." 22 Notebook 14 (1879), Mark Twain Papers, Bancroft Library, ^University of California, Berkeley. 23 Eruption, p. 202. 24 "Mark Twain: An Inquiry" [1901] , in My Mark Twain (New York: Harper and Brothers, 1910), p. 182. 25 Eruption, p. 361 -autobiographical dictation of 1907. 26 Joel Chandler Harris, Editor and Essayist, ed.

Sut Lovingood telling in an 1867 book that Twain reviewed how it was when a rampaging bull smashed into a little bald-headed man: "he jis' disappear'd frum mortui vishun sumhow, sorter like breff frum a lookin-glass."-¬ªSW Lovingood's Yarns, ed. M. Thomas Inge (New Haven: College and University Press, 1966), p. 110. Twain listed George W. Harris, the author of this book, and its publishers in his notes on American humorists in 1880, and he included one of Sut 's stories in his anthology. 28 Enjoyment of Laughter (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1948), pp. 76-80. Eastman cites as an example a memorable Arizona colloquialism: "He's so stingy he wouldn't pay ten cents to see Christ wrastle a bear." "An Inquiry," p. 179. Twain in turn praised Howells for "translating . . . the vision of the eyes of flesh into words that reproduced their forms and colors." 30Julia C. Harris, The Life and Letters of Joel Chandler Harris (Boston, 1918), p. 168; Mark Twain's Letters, 11,401-402. Mark Twain 's Letters, II, 504-505. 32 The first "Mark Twain" is cornered by Simon Wheeler in the frog story; the second is inveigled into hearing the drunken Jim Blaine tell about his grandfather's ram and many unrelated matters. 33 Mark Twain's America, p. 251. Another "Mark Twain" listens with pleasure to a long story and appreciates its mining camp teller-clearly Jim Baker although here he is called Dick Baker: "Whenever he was out of luck and a little down-hearted, he would fall to mourning over the loss of a wonderful cat he used to own (for where women and children are not, men of kindly impulses take up with pets, for they must 146</page><page sequence="16">love something). And he always spoke of the strange sagacity of that cat with the air of a man who believed in his secret heart that there was something human about it-maybe even supernatural." Roughing It, Chapter 61. 34Walter Blair, Mark Twain &amp; "Huck Finn" (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1960), pp. 235-328, passim, treats numerous instances. 35Brander Mathews, writing about "the immense variety" of Twain's style, writes: "Consider the tale of the Blue Jay . . . wherein the humor is sustained by unstated pathos: what could be better told than this, with every word the right word and in the right place?"-"An Appreciation," in Mark Twain, Europe and Elsewhere (New York: Harper and Brothers, 1923), p. xxviii. In Mark Twain &amp; " Huck Finn," pp. 172-178, I have discussed various factors in the humorist's personal situation that caused him to write sympathetically about the misanthropic Jim Baker and the frustrated blue-jay. 147</page></plain_text>
