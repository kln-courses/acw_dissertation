<plain_text><page sequence="1">32 FRICTIONAL FIRE-MAKING WITH A FLEXIBLE SAWING-THONG. BY HENRY BALFOUR. AMONG the various methods whereby fire is obtained by friction of wood, there is one whose varieties and geographical distribution have not hitherto been described with any degree of comnpleteness, although its ethnological significance is an important one. I have, therefore, thought that it might prove of use if I were to bring together rny notes on the subject, with a view to placing on record the wide range of this special method, as far as I have been able to trace it through a study of the literatuire and of specimens preserved in inuseums and private collections. I hope that the descriptions and the maps which I offer may be the means of eliciting further data, and that thus the complete geographical range of this fire- making appliance may become known. The better-known frictional fire-making apparatus which involves the employ- ment of a rigid, blade-like saw of bamboo or wood, is to be traced over an area which, to put it briefly, extends from India and Assam, though the Indo-Chinese region, the Malay Peninsula, and the Asiatic Archipelago, to Australia. It is also employed in the Nicobar Islands and in North America, and has been claimed for one district in Ceintral Africa. In Europe, too, it has been used in various regions. I do not propose here to give a detailed description of its geographical dispersal, buit merely refer to it as being a sawing method which is closely allied to the one under consideration, and whose geographical r'ange coincides to a very great extent with that of the latter. In the East, at any rate, it seems probable that the flexible saw, as applied to fire-making, is merely an ilnteresting variant of the rigid saw, and that these two methods have one comrnon origin. The essential difference between these two " sawing'" methods is to be seen in the "saw " itself, which in the one is a rigid blade or stick, and in the other is a flexible band or thongu. In nearly all cases where the flexible saw is employed, the procedure is essentially the same. A stout piece of bamboo or wood is held in position, and a narrow thong of cane or other suitable material is looped round it, the friction beino caused by pulling the ends of the thong alternately, so that it is sawn across the stick or post, detachingi, in the process a fine wood-powder and generatingr by the friction sufficient heat to ignite the powder and cause it to smoulder. From the smouldering dust a flame can readily be obtained with the help of some quickly inflamtmable material, such as dry grass, etc. The details and accessories of the process are referred to in the various local descriptions which I</page><page sequence="2">F'rictiona -Fire-making with a Flexible Sawing-thong. 33 quote below in the order of their geographical dispersal, which, as far as I have hitherto ascertained, is as follows:- NAGA HILLS, ASSAM.-The north-westerly extremity of the main area of geographical range of the practice of fire-making with the flexible saw is to be found amongst the NAGAS of the Naga Hills, who adopt this method, at any rate locally. Reference to this region was given by the late Mr. S. E. Peal, formerly resident in Sibsagar, who wrote' that fire was obtained by the Nagas (or Nogas, as he preferred to call them) " by means of a long piece of cane passed under a dry log and pulled (i.e., the ends) alternately by the right and left hand, so as to ignite somie tinder placed in a hollow or split underneath" (see Fig. 1). NAGA, ASsAM. FIG. 1 a ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Ci NAGA, ASSAM NA A,SSAM. FIG. 2. FIG. 2A. In the Ethnological Museum at Berlin I saw a Naga fire-making apparatus of this kind (Fig. 2), the native names for the various parts being given as follows, yung = the cane strip, mniset = the wooden stick, renr-a = the tinder. I have also just received, through the kindness of Mr. J. H. Hutton, a complete fire-making set from the Naga Hills, consisting (Fig. 2A) of a billet of lime wood, split at one end and wedged open with a stone. The thong is a narrow sliver split from a piece of bamboo and whittled smooth, the shavings from this supplying the tinder, which is placed under the fork. The billet is held down on the ground 1 Joturn. Antkrop. lnst., xxii, 1893, p. 252, and Plate XVIII. VOL. XLIV. D</page><page sequence="3">34 HENRY BALFOUR.-Frictional Fire-makcing witlh the foot, and the thoing is sawn round it in the usual way. Aliuost any wood may be used but lime is preferred. CHITTAGONG HILLS.-Captain T. H. Lewin' describes in detail this metlhod as practised by the TIPPEKAH tribe of the Chittagong hill-tracts. "They take a piece of dry bamboo about a foot long, split it in half, and on its outer round suirface cut a nick or notch, about Sth inch broad, circling round the semi-circuinference of the bamboo, shallow towards the edges, but, deepening in the centre, until a miniute slit about a line in breadth pierces the inner surface of the bamboo fire-stick. Then a flexible strip of bamboo is taken, about 12 feet long aind 1th inch in breadth, to fit the circlinig notch or groove in the fire-stick. This slip or band is rubbed with fine, dry sand, and then passed round the fire-stick, on which the operator stands, a foot on either end. Then the slip, grasped firmly, an end inl each hand, is pulled steadily back and fortb, increasing gradually in pressure and velocity as the smoke comes. By the time the fire-band snaps with the friction, there ought to appear through the slit in the fire-stick some incandescent dust, and this, placed smouldering as it is in a nest of dry bamboo shavings, can be gently blown into a flame." ANNAM.-Away to the eastward, the same process of making fire is adopted by the o4ois, a primitive people inhabiting the table-land and mountains betweenl the Mekong River and the Annam coast, from the fronatiers of Yunnan to Cochin-China. They are probably of Indonesian stock. The process is almost identical with that followed by the Tipperahs. According to M. A. Gauthier,2 half of a split bamboo is notched on the convex surface and is held downl by the feet. Strips of green bamboo-rind are split off, c. 8 mm.- thick and 50 cm. long. To each end a little wooden toggle is fixed. About 100 of these strips are usually prepared at a time. Fire is obtained only after expending some 30-40 strips which break after seven or eight sawing movements. The method is not common, as slow-matches are usually carried, and the Mois also employ the fire-piston.3 MALAY PENINSULA.-In this region, the SAKAI, SEMANG and MALAYS all employ this method. W. Skeat and C. Blagden4 mention that it is a common method among both the Western, or Kedah Semang, and the Eastern Semnang, or Pangan, who use a rattan thong and a dried branch (of certain special trees only) which is held down with the feet. T. N. Annandale and H. C. Robiinson5 give a full description of the process as witnessed by them in Grit in the Upper Perak district, where the older men still resort to it in place of more modern methods. They describe how a SEMANG chief " took a billet of soft wood, about 1I feet long, and split it at one end so as to form a cleft of about 6 inches. Into this he inserted a small stick, which The WVild Races of S.E. India, 1870, pp. 207, 208. 2 Bull. Soc. Geog. du Havre, xiv, 1901, p. 95. v. H.

Beside this he placed some 'palmn-scurf.' He then took a stout strip of rattan, about 5 feet long, and passed one end of it under the billet as it lay on the ground. To each end he fastened a stick, which acted as a handle (of. the Mois above). Then he grasped one of these sticks in each hand, and, holding down the cleft billet by means of his right foot, he began to draw the rattan backwards and forwards across the inner surface of the billet. He grasped the peg which kept the cleft open between the great and second toe. The friction caused by the rattan rubbing against the soft wood soon produced a, considerable amiount of heat, which first blackened the wood and then caused the tinder to take fire. Lifting up the billet, the man had no difficuilty in lightiiig a cigarette at the palm-scurf, which was now smouldering in the cleft." A specimen of this apparatus from Upper Perak is shown in Fig. 3. FIG. 3. In the British Museum there is a fire-making set from the Semang of Grit, with a sawing-thong of bamboo strip, the ends of which are fitted with small wooden toggles (Fig. 3A), as described above in connection with the Semang fire-saw alnd also with that of the Mois.' MNALAY STA-TES FIG. 3A. The same authors2 describe a similar process among the MAI DARA'T (SAKAI) of the Batang Padang district of Southern Perak. The actual procedure differed slightly from that seen among the Semnang, as the wooden billet was not split and no peg was inserted. The tinder was held near the groove formed by the rattan thong. "The ends of the rattan were held by a man sitting on the ground, and the same man shoved against the billet of wood with his riglht foot, thus keeping it pressed hard against the rattan, which he drew backwards and forwards round it. 1 Handbook to the Ethn-ographical Collections, 1910, Fig. 7c. 2 "Fasciculi Malayenses," Anthrop., pt. i, 1903, p. 14. D 2</page><page sequence="5">36 HENRY BALFOUR.-Frictional Fire-making This method is considered most efficient if suitable materials could be obtained; but very strong rattan was necessary, as well as peculiarly soft wood." Alternative methods with the Mai Darat are fire-making, with the stiff bamboo saw or with the thong-drill. A specimen from the Mai Darat is in the British Museum. Captain G. B. Cerrutil gives a somewhat different version of the process as seen by him among the SAKAI. " A bamboo reed is taken and a small hole is made in it, into which is introduced the tinder, a downy substance found at the base of palm-leaves and known by the name of lulup among the Malays. Round the bamboo is wound two or three times a long strip of very flexible rattan. The operator holds in his hands the two ends of the rattan, and, pressing firmly upon the -bamboo with his feet, commences to pull first one end and then the other, forcibly and with great rapidity" (Fig. 4). Leaves of dry grass are thrown on to the tinder when this has ,(, &gt;) become ignited. The way in which the smoke of the resultant fire behaves is observed and is used for divininig whether a selected site for a new habitation is auspicious or not. I must confess to feeling some doubt as to the cane thong being " wound two or three times " round the bamboo, since it is likely that the friction would be too great to admit of rapid sawing, and to pass the cane thong more than once round is contrary to the practice of other peoples who employ this method. _ __ - The MALAYS of the Peninsula are mentioned by S AKAI. Nelson Annandale and by Leonard Wray as employing FIG. 4. at times the flexible-saw apparatus for fire-making, though ordinarily other imore modern methods are available. A specimen of the Malayan apparatus (Fig. 5) was sent to me in 1892 by Mr. Leonard Wray, and is now in the Pitt Rivers Museum. It is practically similar to the Semang apparatus M1PLAY, PERAK. FIG. 5. (Fig. 3) and consists of a stout stick of very soft, white wood, split at one end and with a wooden plug inserted in the cleft, to keep the two halves apart, a collar of rattan preventing the slit from extending. Tinder formed of bamboo shreds is inserted in the cleft at the point where the sawing takes place. The saw is a long 1 NVel Paese dei T'eleni, 1906, p. 161; and in the translated version, My Friends the Savages, 1908, p. 146.</page><page sequence="6">with a Flexible Sawing-thong. 37 and flexible cane thong. In using the apparatus,ithe Malay sets the stick vertically against a tree, fixing the, upper enid by binding a cane strip round it and the tree (Fig. 6). The lower end is steadied with the foot, and the ends of the cane thong which is passed round the stick at the spot where the tinder is, are alternately pulled horizontally. BORNEO.-Passing eastward, as I have no reference to the occurrence of this method in Sumatra, the next reaion to be noted is Sarawak and the adjacent parts of British North Borneo and Central Borneo, where it is employed nowadays ceremonially by the KAYANS and KENYAHS, especially by the former. W. H. Furness' describes the ceremonies observed in connection with the naming of a child at the house of Tama Bulan, a Kenyah chief, living about 400 miles inland on the Pata River, a tributary of the Baram. New-fire had to be procured by friction. He says, "The Musa consists of a piece of soft fibrous wood, which is KENYAH MALAY, PERAK FIG. 6. 7. held down by the feet, firinly on the ground, and rests upon a bundle of fine slivers of dry wood; underneath it is passed a strip of dry but flexible bamboo, which is sawed back and forth until the friction starts a spark in the fine dust which has been thereby rubbed up; the spark is fostered and soon blown into a flame in the bundle of slivers. When the materials are in proper condition, fire can be produced in much less than a minute. Should all the fires in a house go out, or when fire is to be started for the first time in a new house, the Musa is the only method whereby fire may be kindled,-no flint and steel, nor fire-drill, nor fire- syringe, nor matches (common enough, thanks to the Chinese bazaar), can be used; it must be the Musa, and the Musa alone. At the naming of a child, the piece of soft wood is carved into a grotesque head at one end. The image thus nmade is called 'Laki Pesong,' the god of the Musa." In Fig. 7 I reproduce this author's 1 Home Life of the Borneo Head-hunters, 1902, p. 37.</page><page sequence="7">38 HENRY BALFOUR.-Frictional Fire-making figure of the apparatus. It will be noted that in this example, the stick is not split at oile end, but a narrow longitudinal slit is cut through it and answers the same purpose as a cleft. A number of the bamboo strips are shown. Mr. Furness also refers to the Musa in Folk Lore in Borneo' and mentions that it is also employed when consulting the omen birds. It appears that divination is also practised in conjunction with the production of lnew-fire at a child-naming, since, if the cane saw, at the moment when the spark is obtained, breaks in even lengths, the omen is regarded as unlucky and a new name must be chosen, whereas if the two pieces are of unequal size, the omen is auspicious alnd the name is a good one. FIG. 8. FIG. 9. Fig. 8, taken from a photograph given me by the late R. Shelford, shows a Kayan making fire in the manner described. Figs. 9, 10 and 11 are from specimens collected by Mr. C. Hose in 1904 and 1906 from the Kayans of the Barain district, Sarawak, and were made for use during the child-naming ceremony. One specimen (Fig. 9) is completely anthropomorphic. Fire has been obtained by sawing the FIG. 10. cane thong round one of the legs of the figure, and not across the slot which separates the legs. Mr. Hose states that the figure represents Laki IPesong, the god of fire, to whom Kayans pray for long life for a child, and he adds that the 1 1899, pp. 8, 10 and 24.</page><page sequence="8">with a Flexible Sawing-thong. 39 carved wooden piece is called pesong, the cane thong pusa. The second specimen (Fig. 10) is also anthropomorphic, the head of Laki Pesong being carved at each end, the longitudinal slot at the centre representing in a conventional manner the fused legs of the two figures. The third example (Fig. 11) is not carved, but one end is split, the cleft being wedged open with a piece of wood. As in the example shown in Fig. 9, the fire groove appears on one limb only of the fork, and does not extend across the cleft. Some palni-scurf tinder accompanies this specimen. A similar apparatus is in the British Museum. Hose and McDougalll describe and figure another example of the Kayan apparatus (Fig. 12) in which Laki Pesono KAYAN K AY A 14 FIG. 11. FIG. 12. is represented as a squatting figure, carved at one end. "For each child who is to be named a small human image in soft wood is prepared. This is an effigy of Laki Pesong, the god whose special function it is to care for the welfare of the children. A small mat [shown in Fig. 12 and also in Fig. 9] is woven and a few strips of rattan provided for each child. Each child sits with his (or her) mother in the gallery beside the door of their room, and the parents announce the name they propose for the child. Then the father, or some other man, after killing a chick or younig pig, lays the image on the mat before the child, passing one of the rattan strips beneath it, and, holding the image firmly with a big toe on each end of it, pulls the strip rapidly to and fro, until it is made hot by its friction against the imiiage, and smoke begins to rise." The cane thong breaks eventually and the auspiciousness or inauspiciousniess of the suggested name is divined according to whether the two pieces are of unequal or of equal length. If the latter occurs, another name is suggested aind is submitted to the same test. The name pusa appears to be applied to the whole apparatus and also to the ceremony. 1 The Pagan Tribes of Borneo, 1912, ii, p. 160, and Plate 168, Fig. 2.</page><page sequence="9">40 HENRY. BALFOUR.-Frictional Fire-making Dr. A. W. Nieuwenhuis' figures a specinlen obtained from the Kayans of Ceiltral (Dutch) Borneo, a sketch from his photograph being reproduced in Fig. 13. This specimen is almost identical with that shown in Fig. 11, the stick, however, being merely split for half its length, the "limbs" retaining their rouch edges, instead of being rounded off as in the latter example. Also, if we can judge from Dr. Nieuwenhuis' photo- graph, the " saw " passes round both limbs, instead of round olle only, as in the more specialized, anthropo- X /. morphic apparatus of the Kayans. Since in the other regions where this method of fire-production obtains, the band almost invariably passes round both "limbs" of the stick, when this is split and wedged open, we nmay regard this example as re- FIG. 13. presenting the more primitive type in Borneo, and it seems likely that the anthropomorphic association in this island was first suggested by the bifurcatioin of the stick, which simulated body and legs, the human resemlblance being improved upon subsequently. This involved iincidentally a shaping and rounding of the legs of the figure, and, the rough edges having been eliminated, it was probably found that the requisite friction was more readily produced by sawing round one of the rounded limbs than by sawing round both, and also that the little pile of friction-dust became concentrated upon smaller space, enabling it to accumulate the heat quicker. We may, I think, account in this manimer for what appears to be a departure from the normal procedure. This method appears nowadays to be restricted in Borneo to purely ceremonial. use. For domestic purposes alternative methods of fire-production, associated with various tribes, are the rigid fire-saw, the hand fire-drill, percussioni with bamboo and crock, flint-and-steel, the fire-piston, and, recently, imported matches. PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.-In the Philippine group the thong-saw is again met with among the Negritos of Casiguran, N.-E. Luzoni, whose apparatus was collected by Dr. Semper and has been described and figured by Dr. A. B. Meyer.2 It consists (Fig. 14) of a stick, 32 cm. lonig, split for two-thirds of its length, the two parts being wedged apart with a piece of wood, some white bark-cloth serving as tinder, and a long strip of rattan, beJuco, about a metre long, serving as a saw. The bark-cloth is fixed in the cleft of the stick and the rattan thong a is sawn round both liinbs of the fork in the usual manner. The specimens are in the Dresden Museum. The Mangyans of the Bako district of Mindoro Island (which lies between 1 In Central Borneo, 1900, i, Plate XIX. 2 Die Philippinien, publication of the Royal Museum, Dresden, No. ix, 1893, Plate II, Fig. 7, and p. 5.</page><page sequence="10">with a Flexible Sawing-thong. 41 Luzon and Palawan), also make fire with the rattan thong-saw. Mr. M. L. Miller writes of them as follows: "In the Bako region practically every man met with, and some women as well, wears on the left upper arm 1 or 2 or 3 armlets of -rattan. These appear ornamental, but are used in makinig fire. A piece of dry wood about 3 cm. in diameter is selected, one end of it is split for a distance of 12 or 14 cm. and a plug is put in to keep the slit open. A few shavings are then put tightly into the pl slit where it is narrow. One of the armlets is taken from the arm, un- wound, and passed round the split stick just under the shavings. The split stick is held firmly on the ground with the two feet, and the rattan is drawn rapidly backward and forward until the shavings ignite. A few seconds are sufficient." Mr. Miller has traced Negritic affinities in this district of Mindoro, and it is probable C L I ~~~~~~~C AS I U RAN ,L UZON . that there formerly existed a Negrito FG 14 population in this island. A photograph by Mrs. F. Cooper Cole showing a " pygmy " of the Island of Palawan making fire, is reproduced in The,e Customs of the World.' A sketch from this photograph is given in Fig. 15. The stick in this instance does not appear to be split. Although described as being a " pyginy," it is not certain that the native represented is a NegTito, , though it is probable that he is at any rate partially Negritic. The Island of Palawan forms a geographical link between N.-E. Borneo and Luzon. NEW GUINEA.-We next meet with this apparatus in the Island of New GuLinea, where its distribution covers a wide area, which extelnds into the Dutch, British and German territories. In Dutch New Guinea the most westerly district from which I have a record of the use of the flexible-saw is that of the upper waters of the Mimika River, where it was observed by the members of the recent expedition organized PALAWAN ,PHILIPPINES by the British Ornithologists' Union, 1910-1911, among the FIG. 15. 1 1913, p. 657.</page><page sequence="11">42 HENRY BALFouR.-Frictional Fire-making TAPIRO pygmies of the lower slopes of the mountain range, c. 40 13' S., 1360 43' E. Mr. A. F. R. Wollaston has given a full description of the process.' He also very kindly gave me two sets of the apparatus, and a third set to the Pitt Rivers Museum. Two of these are seen in Figs. 16 and 17. As will be seen, the stick, TAPIRO. TAPIRO,1DUTCrH N GuNEA FIG. 16. FIG. 17. which is quite short in all the examples, is as usual split, the cleft having a small stone inserted so as to keep it open. The example shown in Fig. 16 is split for about three-quarters of its length; the other (Fig. 17) is split right through, but the lower end is kept closed by means of a binding-collar. The thong-saw is a very long strip of rattan, which is kept neatly coiled up in a thick ring. The tinder is usually a piece of the fibrous sheath of a palm-shoot, or a piece of dry moss. The tinder is placed in the narrow part of the cleft, behind the stone. The operator places the stick on the ground, holding it down with one foot. " Then, having unwound about a yard of the rattan, he holds the coil in one hand and the free end in the other, and looping the middle of it underneath the stick at the point where the tinder is placed, he proceeds to saw it backwards and forwards with extreme rapidity (see Ficr. 18). In a short space of time, varying from ten to thirty seconds, the rattan snaps and he picks up the stick with the tinder, which has probably / by this time began to smoulder and blows it into a flame." The thong passes round both limbs of the forked stick. 4 4@ge Both the specimeis figured have been much used and show numerous charred grooves, each of which indicates where a &lt; jj " sawin " has been performed. The fire-saw is most frequently -TAP RO used for lightina tobacco. The Tapiro showed no signs of FIG. 18. surprise at the Englishmen's matches, and did not wish to 1 Pyqmies and Papuans, 1912, pp. 200, 201, 202.</page><page sequence="12">with a Flexible Sawing-thong. 43 possess them, preferring their own primitive contrivance, which they use with such skill and rapidity. Captain C. G. Rawling,' another ulember of the expedition, also refers to fire- making among the Tapiro, and gives three illustrations of the process. Mr. Wollast,on, during the more recent and very successful expedition to Dutch New Guinea in 1913, again observed this method amiong the hill people, of supposed Negritic stock, on the slopes of Mount Carstensz, c. 1370 12' E., 40 10' S., living at an elevation of between 4,000 and 6,000 feet. I am much indebted to him for givino me particuilars in a letter. The practice in this district, which lies somewhat to the east of the region occupied by the Tapiro, is almost identical with that of the latter tribe, only "whereas the Tapiro carry the thong in a long, strip twisted into a ring, the Carstensz people carry it, cut into short lengths, each oile sufficient for one operationi only. They are carried folded in U-shape, tied together in a bundle of a dozen or so . . . They secure the stick with both feet, while the Tapiro hold it down with one foot only, but this may be only a chance This method is not used by the people of the coast."' It is important to note that fire-making with a pliant canie-saw is restricted in Southern Dutch New Guinea to the hill people, who are either true pygmies, or at any rate are largely of Negritic origin. The Papuans of the Mimika River arid Parimau district, as also those of the coastal plains fturther eastward, do not employ this method of procedure. Further eastward, againi, a record of this fire-miiaking method is furnished by Dr. H. A. Lorentz,3 who, during his successful attack upon Wilbelmina Peak, 1907-1909, observed it among the hill natives of the Treub Mountains, on the head- waters of the Lorentz River (Noord River), c. 40 24' S., 1380 42' E. He does not describe the process, but merely says " we learnt how by friction of rotan one can make fire." While Dr. Lorentz states that he did not meet any pygmies, he differentiates between the mouintain Papuans and those of the plains, saying that the former " are not so large as the people of the Lorentz (north) River." Thus, it is very possible that there muay be traceable some Negritic element in the highlands, which would suggest an affinity between these people and the Tapiro, whose method of fire-produiction is the same. On the southern slopes of Mount Goliath, 40 43' S., 1390 51' E., drained by the Eilanden River, Army-Surgeon A. C. de Kock saw natives of Negritic affinity who procured fire after the manner of the Tapiro. Two pieces of 'wood, about 1o cm. long, were bound together so as to enclose a wedge-shaped space at one end, into which tinder from the leaf-sheath of Caryota .Rrnuphiana was inserted. A slender strip of rattan was passed under the forked wood and drawn to and fro.4 1 The Land of the .Vew Guinea Pygmies, 1913, pp. 111 and 273. 2 See also The Geographical Journal, xliii, 1914, p. 262. 3 The Geographical Journal, xxxvii, 1911, p. 489. 4Van dem Broek in Zeit. f.

It was recorded by L. M. D'Albertis1 in 1876, on the head-waters of the Fly River, above the junction with the Alice River, and near the lower slopes of the Victor Emanuel Range. He says, " I observed some round logs of wood, probably- the trunks of small trees-which bore spiral marks of fire. On examiiination I ascertained that with these the natives are accustomed to kindle their fires. A piece of rattan about two feet long, and split in two for about half way its length, used like a rope round a drill, causes the wood to take fire by its friction." There evidently has been some slight confusion in writing up his field-niotes, and we may assume that the words " split in two for about half way its length," applied by him to the cane thong, should rather refer to the log. The partial splitting of the thong seems to be unnecessary, whereas, as has been seen, it is a very usual procedure in other regions in preparing the log or stick for this puirpose. Moreover, D'Albertis himself figures2 a fire-stick (though, unfortuinately, without any data in the text) which is clearly split at one end, and exhibits two transverse grooves across the cleft, evidently produced by sawing-friction (Fig. 19). UPPER FLY R,NEW &amp;=UI NEA FIG. 19. At the mouth of the Fly River this apparatus was observed by the Rev. J. Chalmers in the Island of KIWAI.3 He gives no details, merely saying that fire is sometimes obtaiined " by a length of cane drawn swiftly across a piece of wood held down by the foot: the ends of the cane are held in both hanlds as among the Koiari at the back of Port Moresby." An alternative method of fire-making in Kiwai is the "ploughing" method. The Kiwaians appear to be true Papuails, thouch the statements as regards their stature vary somewhat, and it is possible that some may show a slight admixture of Neuritic blood. A little further eastward and again inland in the mountainl region, the Hon. M. Staniforth Smith discovered the flexible fire-saw among the Bush-natives of the SAMBREGI tribes, a little to the N.W. of Mount MURRAY, liviIng at an altitude of about 6,000 feet above sea level, c. 143' 50' E., 60 40' S.4 'Their niethod of making fire is superior to the usual Papuan system. They get a piece of dry soft wood, split one end and insert a piece of tapa cloth, thenl taking a piece of cane, which they carry twisted round their waists, they place it under the wood on 1 New Guizea, 1880, ii, p. 99. 2 Loc. cit., p. 378, Fig. 2. 3 Journ.

Grasping each an end of the cane, they pull it backwards anld forwards vigorously; when it has eaten half way through the wood to the tapa cloth the heat generated is so great that the cloth smoulders and is blown into a flame. The whole process is accomplished in tenl or fifteen seconds. I am informed that certain niatives on the main range about Kagi adopt this system also; if so, it is interesting as possibly showing soine connection between them." He describes the physique of the Sambregi people as magnificent, and it is unlikely that there is any marked inftusion of Negrito blood among them, although the physique is described as not being uniform. It is suggested that there may be some mingling of Papuans and Paptio-Melanesians in this district. The next locality of which I have record is the district of the Purari Delta, where the MAIPUA tribe is of Papuan stock. I have two sets of the apparatus, karo karo, from this tribe in my collection, and one which is shown in Fig. 20 is in the MAPL!'A PURARP DELA ,NEW CGUINEA. FIG. 20. Pitt Rivers Museun. I puirchased all three together in 1899. Each set consists of one or two long and fairly stout staves or fire-sticks of very light wood resembling Hibiscus, and a bundle of strips of cane in fairly long lengths; two of the sets have in addition a coil or two coils of cane-strip. Also each set has two long wooden pegs, roughly pointed at onie end, as though for fixing in the ground to hold down one end of the fire-stick. The fire-sticks are not split, but are- pointed at one end. No details as to the precise methods pursued in using the apparatus accompanied the specimens, but we may, perhaps, infer that the pointed end of the fire-sticks is driven inito the ground diagonally, the other end of the stick being held in position by the two pegs which are also forced into the ground in such a way as to cross onie another above the stick. One of the cane-thongs would then be passed under the stick and the ends pulled alternately as usual. One of the fire-sticks exhibits a longitudinal groove on one side, evidently produced by fire-makiing by the " ploughing " method, which appears from this to be an alternative method, perhaps derived from contact with Papuo-Melanesian culture, the inifluenice of which extends westwards as far as Cape Possession at least, and nay well have reached the strictly Papuian tribes still further to the westward. We know of the " ploughing" method of fire-making in other parts of the Papuan Gulf, extending as far west as Kiwai Island at the mouth of the Fly River. We next meet with the flexible fire-saw in a group of localities to the west of the extended Owen Stanley Ranige, in a region where the western Papuo-</page><page sequence="15">46 HENRY BALFOUR.-Frictional Fire-makWing Melanesian stock is more or less in direct, contact with the pure Papuanl, and where Negritic affinities have already been traced in certain districts and seem likely to be noticed over a wider area when the various tribes have been subjected to more critical investigation. The Rev. Father V. MI. Egridil has described and figured the process among the KUNI tribe (Kovio group) of Dilava, in the mountains behind Mekeo, c. 8? 33' S., 146? 52' E. These people speak a Melanesian language, though this is probably not a safe guide to the racial affinities of this short, dark, frizzly-haired people. The Kuni usually keep their fires burning, and guard them jealously, and when travelling, carry a smouldering piece of soft wood or of bark-cloth; but when fire has to be obtained, dry leaves are laid upon the ground, and over these some old bark-cloth, to catch the spark caused by sawing a cane strip round a stick held upon the ground by the feet, until the cane breaks (Fig. 21). The operation of IKuNI,DILAVA,,N GUIlEA KAMBISA CHIRIMA VALLEY,N GUINEA FIG. 21. FIG. 22. fire-mnaking is called vinW-jaka, i.e., to pull the cane thong (vine); the fire-stick is called aukapa. These names are only used when these materials are employed for fire-making, au and valo being the ordinary names for the wood and the cane. To the east of Dilava and on the south-east slopes of Mount Albert Edward, in the valley of the Chirima (a tributary of the Mambare River), lie the KAMBISA villages at an altitude of about 6,000 feet, c. 147' 30' E., 8? 35' S. In this district Mr. C. A. W. Monckton in 1906 met with a people of short stature, allied, apparently, to the Kovio group, and therefore to the Kuni. Their system of fire- rnaking is, like that of the latter tribe, by means of the flexible thong-saw. A piece of dry wood is split in two, the two parts being bound together with bark strips towards one end (cf. Fig. 17), and forced apart with a bamboo peg towards the other end. This piece of wood is held down with the foot. A bamboo sawing-thong is passed underneath and round both limbs of the split billet, the ends being alternately pulled, the spark is caught in tinder lodged at the point of friction2 (Fig. 22). It is to be noted that between the Kuni and the Kambisa tribes lie the 1 Anthrovos, ii, p. 108. 2 C. A. W. Monckton, Annual Report, Brit.

Williamson, whose researches have revealed a very strong Negritic strain in this section of the Fuyuge-speaking people. Mr. Williamson and others think it probable that this Negritic element is traceable over a wide area of the nmountain region in this part of New Guinea, and the short stature of the Kuni and Kambisa tribes, to take one characteristic only, would lend colour to the belief that these people also show pygmy affinities. OWE.N STANLEY RANGQ,N.G&amp;UINEPi FIG. 22A. A fire-stick from the Owen Stanley Range (exact locality not specified), now in Mr. E. Bidwell's collection, is shown in Fig. 22A. The stick is, as usual, split at one end and wedged open with a peg. It has been sawn once with a strip of rattan about 6 mm. in diameter. I am indebted to Mr. Bidwell for particulars and sketches. At KAGI, on the western spurs of the Owen Stanley Range, under Mount Kaneve, c. 147? 40' E., 90 10' S., and at an elevation of 4,000 to 5,000 feet, fire is made with the same apparatus, according to Colonel Kenneth Mackay.' " They make fire by passing a length of cane under a partly split piece of soft stick (the cleft being held open by a pebble), and draw it quickly up and down where the wood rests on some dry mulberry leaves. In response to the friction, smoke begins to rise in three or four minutes." Mr. Staniforth Smith (op. cit.) has drawn atten- tion to the similarity in physique observable between the Kagi people and the Sambregi of Mount Murray, who also practise this method of fire production. In the neighbourhood of Kagi, i.e., on the upper waters of the Naoro or Brown River and on the slopes of the main range, this process was observed by Dr. H. 0. Forbes at Uburukara, situated on Mount Archer, which is due south of Mouint Owen Stanley, c. 147? 32' E., 90 0' S.2 He says, "Most of the men wore on their arms, or hanging in their girdles behind, coils of rattan rope, which are used by them for 'making fires.' For this purpose the operator, first selecting a dry fraginent of wood, makes in it a split, in which he inserts a peg to keep it agape; into this split he places loosely a morsel of tinder plucked out of his girdle or skirt. He next cuts from his dry coil of rattan a short length, lays it on a dry leaf on the ground alid places over it the tinder plug in the cleft stick; then placing his knee or foot on the end of the stick, he pulls the rattan cord rapidly to and fro under it till the tinder ignites, when, by blowing gently through the cleft, he fans the spark into a flamie. The whole operation is the most effective and rapid of any native fire-producing contrivances that I know."' On the lower slopes of the main Owen Stanley Range, in the hinterland of Port Moresby and the Motu area, the KOIARI employ the same device, as observed 1 Across Papua, 1909, p. 149. 2 Proc. Geogn. Soc., xii, 1890, p. 562.</page><page sequence="17">48 HENRY BALFOUR.-Frictional Fire-making by the Rev. W. G. Lawes in the Tabure and Sogere villages on the slopes of Mount Warirata (Astrolabe Range), c. 90 25' S., 147' 20' to 147? 33' E., the natives of which are typical Koiarians.1 " They get a dry stick of pithy wood and split it a little way. In the cleft they put a piece of wood or a stone to keep it open, then puttilng a little rubbish as, tinder under the split part of the stick, they stand onl the other end and pass a strip of rattan cane or bamboo under the cleft, drawing it rapidly np and down, when it soon begins to smoke, and a spark appears between the fork of the stick, which with a little manipulation sets fire to the tinder and a flame is soon obtained. It seems to me easier and quicker than the common way of getting fire with two sticks." Dr. 0. Finsch also saw fire made in the same manner amongst the Koiari. He tells us2 that the stick, called ntewata, is short, peeled and lonigitudinally split at onle end, the cleft being wedged open with a stone. The native takes a handful of dry grass, rubs it up into a pellet and lays it under the cleft stick, on which he places his foot to hold it firmly. A long strip of split bamaboo, called ana, is drawn to anld fro throuigh the cleft, fire often being obtainied in - ) ~ 30 seconds. The atnc is carried by every native; any ____ _ dry stick will serve for the " hearth." It will be noted that the thong is described as passing through the cleft, but the figure (Fig. 23) given by L. Frobenius3 of the apparatus which Finsch gave to the Berlin Museum shows the thong passing round both limbs of the cleft 1KOIAF8 N. G~tJ~Nstick, in the more usual manner, and, moreover, the FIG. 23. friction-grooves appear to indicate that this was actually the case. It seems likely that Finsch's description was slightly at fault, in spite of there being precedent in Borneo for the procedure as described by him, and in German New Guinea also, if Miklucho-Maclay's description, quoted below, is correct upon this point. In German New Guinea the occurrence of the flexible fire-saw has been noted by several observers, though the recorded localities are all confined to the eastern district lying between Astrol.abe Bay and Huon Gulf, and are situated either on the coast or at no great distance inland. The first personi to refer to this process in German New Guiinea was the Russian, N. v. Miklucho-Maclay,4 who observed it in 1872 in some of the hill-villages of Enalam-inala and Tieingurn-manla near the Malay Coast (Rhaj Coast), to the, south of Astrolabe Bay. A piece of very dry wood, called ilol, was split at one end with a stone axe, and a strip of split cane or liana was passed through the cleft and sawn backwards and forwards with inereasinig rapidity in the usual manlner. The wooden billet was held down on the 1 Letter fronm Mr. Lawes to the Roy. Geograph. Soc., Proc. B.G.S., v, 1883, p. 357. 2 Ann. d. K.K. NaturI&amp;ist.

The operation lasted half an hour. Here, again, the thong is described as passino through the cleft, and olne would have liked confirmation of this. The time stated to be required to obtain the spark is remarkable in view of the statements by other observers as to the ease and rapidity with which fire can be procured by this method. One wonders how a thin strip of cane could withstand the friction so long without breaking, and also how the operator could continue the motion for half an hour without becoming exhausted. Half a myiinute is nearer the time usually required to produce the desired effect. Further south, the method is employed by the POUM, who dwell in the mountains inlaiid from the coast, to the north-west of Finsch- Hafen. The process has been described by Dr. Rudolf Pbch,l to whom it was shown by Mazeng, one of the chiefs of the tribe, who selected a dry sticI' with the bark attached, about a. metre long and about 5 cm. in diameter. This was split longitudinially at one end,, Pour1 GCeRMAN N GUINEA FIG. 24. the cleft beinig wedged open with a small piece of wood (Fig. 24). This stick was bound round to preveiit the cleft extending too far. It was then firmly bound to the house-post in a horizonital positionl. Next, Mazeng, tore a fragmenit frolm his bark coat and forced it into the cleft. Then he uintwisted one of the many armlets of coiled rattan strip which lhe was wearing, so as to have a thong about a metre in length.

K</page><page sequence="19">50 HENRY BALFOUR.-Frictional Fire-making suggesting that the wearing of this particular kind of cane armlet is connected with this method of makiilg fire. It is very commonly worn amongst the Poum, but is rare among the neighbouring Kai tribe of the Sattelberg district, who do not appear to make fire in this manner. The cane thong is always ready to hand, as it is oily necessary to untwist a convenient length from the armlet, and, as has been pointed out, the Tapiro pygmies of Dutch New Guinea wear identical armlets and employ them in an identical manner for fire-making. The Poum do not exhibit any marked Nearitic affinity, but it is noteworthy that the Kai, though speaking a pure Papuan language, are a mlleso- to brachycephalic people of low stature, the men averaging 5 feet, while a considerable percentage measure only 4 feet 4 inches.1 So that it appears that a pygmy element remains in this region. The HUPE, who are near neighbours of the Pouni, livinig to the south-east of the latter, in a district to the west of the Sattelberg, inland from Finsch-Hafen (c. 1470 30' E., 6? 20' S.), produce their fire in a manner nearly identical with that practised by the Poum. The following description is derived from Dr. R. Neuhauss.2 Among the Hupe, (as among the Poum, two men perform the operation. The cleft 8tiek is lashed to two other long sticks so as to form a tripod. Dry grass or bast is lodged in the cleft and two men saw a rattan thong across the cleft over the tinder, pullinig the ends alternately (Fig. 26). Fire is quickly and easily obtained by tlhem. Neuhauss cinematographed the process. In order to have a ready supply of cane strip for fire-making, the iupe wear armlets of coiled cane like those of the Poum and Tapiro.

Lastly, the natives of the district inland from Samoa Hafen, in Huon Gulf (c. 70 S.), as observed also by Neuhauss (op. cit.), employ the cane fire-saw after the less elaborate fashion prevalent in British and Dutch New Guinea. They do niot 1 Geographical Journal, xxx, p. 610. 2 Deutsch Neu Guinea, 1911, i, p. 252, and iii, p. 24.</page><page sequence="20">with a Flexible Sawing-thong. 51 fix the stick upon a framework, but the operator (one only) stands upon a stick which is cleft and holds some dry grass as tinder, and saws with the cane thong passed under it (Fig. 27). The neighbouring Lae-Womnba on the lower Markham River employ the " fire-plough." The references which I have so far given show a very wide, though undoubtedly conqnected, geographical range for this specialized system of fire production, extendino, as it does, from Assam to Eastern New Guinea, the two extremes of dispersal being linked by sporadic occurrences of this method throughout the intervening area. There can be little doubt that the flexible thong-saw is closely related to the better known sawing method, i.e., with a rigid, blade-like " saw " of bamboo or wood, which prevails in the Asiatic Islands as far east as the Philippines and the Kei Islands, and to the westward extends to the Malay Peninsula, Burma, Siam, the Nicobars and India (Madras Presidency). In Australia, too, this method of " sawing " fire is fairly common. In some instances, where wood is used instead of bamboo, the lower stick is split and the cleft is wedged open, just as is so very frequently done where the cane thong-saw is employed. Or, instead of splitting the wood, a piece may be chosen which has a natural crack in it, answering the purpose of a cleft, or again a groove or pit is cut in the wood and the "saw " is worked across this. This use of a cleft or longitudinal groove across which the sawinig is performed, affords an additional link between the two methods of fire- sawing. It is difficult to determine which of the two methods is the more primitive, but perhaps the rigid saw may claim to be regarded as the earlier. It is rather more simple, and its prevalence in Australia. where the flexible saw does rnot exist, may emphasize that clairn to priority of invention. On1 the other hand, the flexible saw is a marked feature in the culture of those tribes in New Guinea which show vNegritic affinities, or which are adjacent to Negritic tribes, amongst whom the rigid fire-saw is not known. The one method has not been, strictly speaking, evolved from the other, since intermediate stages do not occur, and cannot very well do so; but it seems likely that both are variants of the scame -procedure, arrived at in slightly different ways and converging. A previous -knowledge of the rigid fire-saw would readily have suggested the adoption of the flexible saw as a variant or alternative in districts where cane is common and is used for other purposes in the form of narrow strips. AFRICA.-Leavino, now this important and extensive eastern area of dispersal of the flexible fire-saw, let me turn to other regions in which this particular manner of producing fire has been observed. As far as I am aware, there is only one other part of the world where this process has been noted amongst a people living under conditions of strictly primitive culture and this, curiously enough, is completely isolated from the rest of the geographical distribution. This is in West Africa, among the Ba-Kele (Ba-Kalai or A-Kele) of the Ogowe6 River district. The late Miss Mary Kingsley wrote,' " On one occasion I saw a Ba-Kele ' Travels in WVest Africa, 1897, p. 600. E 2</page><page sequence="21">52 HENRY BALFOUR.-Frictional Fire-mnaki'g woman make fire by means of a slip of raphia palm drawn very rapidly, to and fro across a notch in another piece of raphia wood." As far as I am aware, there is no other similar reference to this method in any part of Africa, and one must regret that Miss Kingsley's description of the process is so meagre, as it barely suffices to convince one that this is an undoubted instance of the employnment of a flexible saw in fire-making. Anl illustration would have made it clear, but this, un- fortunately, is lacking. The expression " a slip of raphia palm drawn. . . to and fro across ....," seems definitely to suggest a narrow and therefore pliaint band of the material, the ends of which were alternately pulled, to cause the friction by sawing transversely across the stick, and if this is the correct diagnosis, thenl the apparatus is strictly analogous to the flexible fire-saw of the Indonesian area and of New Guinea. Moreover, the description cannot apply either to the "hand- drilling" method or to the "ploughing" (" stick and groove ") method of fire- making, which are the only other frictional methods described from "Savage" Africa, unless a statement, which has, I believe, been made, that a form of fire-saw is used in Katanga, is substantiated. Perhaps some light may be thrown upon the Ba-Kalai fire-saw by other witnesses. In the meanitime I merely refer with a certain amounit of reserve, due to lack of detail and corroborationl, to the only record I have found of this characteristically eastern method being practised in Africa. EUROPE.-It is interestingo to note that among several other methods whereby "New-fire " or " Need-fire" is, or has been, produced for ceremonial purposes, the flexible fire-saw finds a place. I need not here enter into the general consideration of the survival in Europe of primitive frictional fire-making appliances, as a feature in certain religious or superstitious observances. The belief that fire after prolonged use becoines stale, as it were, and loses its mystic power and virtues, is, or at any rate has been, very widely spread in Europe, even amid environmeints of highly developed culture. The persistence of this belief into quite recent times is very remarkable.' The actual procedure varies in the different localities, and the apparatus employed to elicit the niew-fire occurs in several different forms, but I will confine myself now to the instances of the employment in Europe of the flexible fire-saw for this purpose. SWEDEN.-The following descriptions and figures of the various procedures as practised in Sweden, when need-fire (nodeld or gnideld) was required, are culled from a very interesting paper by Nils Keyland.2 First method.-A length of rope, willow-strip or strap is passed completely round a log of wood, and the ends are pulled alternately by two men until a spark is generated and can be caught upon a piece of tinder (Fig. 28). This imianner of making fire is employed in Eksharad, Vermland, both for amusement and 1 Vide Grimm, Teutonic Xythology; Tylor, Early Hist. of Yankind; Kuhn, Die Herab- kunft des Feuers, etc. 2 "Primitiva eldgdrningsmetoder i Sverige," Fatabutren, 1912, pp. 15-17, anld 1913, pp. 92-94.</page><page sequence="22">with a Plexcible Sawing-thong. 53 ceremonially, in cases of special need. August Bjornander, of Manstads socken, Kindshuirad, Vesterg6tland, who was born in 1839, describes a similar process, in which a bast rope is wound twice round a dry branch of birch or aspen, on which the bark remains, or else round a dry tree-stump. The cord was pulled by two men. VERMLPNO. 5WEDEN. VERMLSPND, 5WEoEN. FIG. 28. FIG. 29. Second method.-This varies from the first only in the thong being passed half r-o2&amp;nd the logf or stump. One man can thus perform the operation, pulling both ends of the thong himself, though in the illustration (Fig. 29), two are shown, each of whom pulls one end; Eksharad, Vermland. According to information supplied by Nils Olsson Lack of Lindhojden, Elga socken, Verinland, need-fire was produced by pulling a cord passed half-round a dry pine, or fir-stick, which was held firmly between the knees (Fig. 30). This method was practised by the forest peasants when necessity drove them to it. VERAMLAND. SWEUEN. VERM LAND. SWEDEN FIG. 30. FIG. 31. Third rnethod.-Jan Olsson of Vaxvik, K6la socken, Vermland, described a mianner of producing need-fire by sawing a rope backwards and forwards over the</page><page sequence="23">54 HENRY BALFOUR.-Frictional Fire-making top rail of a wooden fence (Fig. 31). The information was based upon hearsay, and it was not stated whether the process was conducted for any special purpose. Fourth method.-This is a peculiar variant, as the thong is fixed and the billet of wood is moved along it. One end of the thong, which is passed round a small stick, is attached to a stump, or other fixed object, and the other end is held by a man who strains it tightly, so that it grips the centre of the stick, which is thus held transversely. A second person, holding the ends of the stick in his hands, forces it backwards and forwards (spokeshave fashion) along the thong, the encircling portion of which causes enough friction to generate the desired spark (Fig. 32), Eksharad, Vermland. This inversion of the more usual practice is comparable with the inverted sawing process in Burma, Borneo and elsewhere in the East, in which the bamboo blade (or saw) is fixed, and the "hearth" is worked A;~~~~~~~~~~~~m VE RMLA4D,SWEOEN F1G. 32. FIG. 33. like a spokeshave along its upturned edge, a method sometimes practised as an alternative to the more usual one of sawing the blade across the fixed " hearth." Both ways are equally easy when bamboo is employed, and I have very frequently perforrned the operation successfully. Fifth method.-Another variant of the flexible-saw mechanism was used in Smaland, South Sweden, in the eighteenth century (1763) for averting the evil glance (fascinationenb) when fishing-gear was thought to have been bewitched. A hole was bored in an oaken door-post, and through it a strap or cord was drawn backwards and forwards till fire was obtained and could be caught in brimstone. The fishing-gear was then smoked over the fire so created. According to Smiback-Johannes of Vaxvik, Vermland, a mian of about 80 years of age, need-fire was made by a similar procedure in order to cure pigs when smitten by disease. A leathern thong was passed through a hole in a door, and a couple of men, standing on either side of the door, pulled the ends alternately until a spark was generated by the frictioln (Fig. 33). From this a fire of shavings, etc., was kindled at the door of the pig-stye, and the pigs were driven through it.</page><page sequence="24">with a Flexible Sawing-thong. 55 Sixth method.-The description of a very curious and seemingly unique thong- sawing method of fire-production is contributed by J. P. Hedberg, who says that his father, who was born in 1828, served in his youth as farm labourer with a peasant in Abyn, Savar socken, Vesterbotten, North Sweden. One day he and his employer were in the forest and wanted a fire, but had no means of making it. So they took a fairly lonlg strip of withy or birch which they twisted up into the form of a closed ring. This ring or loop they fitted round a dry old fir-stump, v and they then pushed the end of a stick between the stump and the ring, twisting the loop once ,,4 jf4 &gt; round the stick to make it grip the stump firmly, --. whereupon, using the stick as a lever, they walked ANGERMANLAND, SWEDEN round the tree-truink (Fig. 34). The friction of FIG. 34. the cord, thus sawn against the stump generated smoke, and later a spark, from which fire was obtained. J. P. Hedberg, although he was not present on the above occasion, at a later date saw fire produced for fun by the process which he describes. This was apparently in Angermanland, North Sweden. GERMANY.-Grin-ml quotes the following passage from Lindenbrog's Glossary of thle Capitularies:-" Rusticani homines in multis Germaniae locis, et festo quiden?, S. Johannis Baptistae die, palumn sepi extrahunt, extracto funem circumligant, illumque hu6e itlluc ducunt, donec ignernl concipiat, quern? stipula lignisque aridioribus aggestis curate fovent, ac. cineres collectos supra olera spargunt, hoc medio erucas abigi pQsse inane superstitione credentes. Eum ergo ignem " nodfeur&lt; " et " noclfyr," quasi necessarium ignem^, vocant." The description given in this account appears clearly to indicate a process of obtaining new-fire (nothfeuer of the Germans) by pulling a cord to and fro round a stake and causing a spark by sawing-friction. The expression " illumque huc illutc ducunt " seems more applicable to drawing the corcl (funis) than to turning the stake (palus), though the possibility occurs to one that, this record is merely a careless description of the far commoner method of turning a spindle, jammed between two uprights, with the help of an encircling cord, after the fashion of a " thona-drill." The latter process was widely practised in Europe, from Scotland and Scandiiiavia to the Balkan States. We may, however, be content to take the passage literally and accept it as affording an instance of the use of the flexible-sawing method in Germany; the more so, since there is precedent for its occurrence in various parts of Northern EuLrope. The particular use of the ashes of the fire kindled in this manner-that is, for driving away caterpillars from the kitchen garden-is interesting. In the Mark, Germany, the custom prevailed of making a nothfeuter on certain occasions, especially when there was disease among the swine. "Before sunrise two stales of dry wood are dug into the ground amid solemn silence, and hempen 1 Teutonic Mytholo,y, 1883, ii, p. 604.</page><page sequence="25">056 HENRY BALFOUR.-Frictional Fire-mak-ing ropes that go round them are pulled back and forwards till the wood catches fire; the fire is fed with leaves and twigs, aiid the sick animals are driven through."' Here, again, a suspicion may arise that the apparatus may have really been of the nature of a " thong-drill" rather than a " cord-saw." At least, the reference to two stakes fixed in the ground is suggestive of the two uprights between which a -spindle would be janimed, so that it could be rotated with a cord and create friction against the uprights. It is regrettable that the descriptions have not furnished more detail, making the precise method perfectly clear. The practice of kindling nothfeuer by frictioni conltinued in the Mark as late as the middle of the nineteenth century. RUSSIA.-An interesting account of procuring need-fire for prophylactic purposes, is given in a chapter on " leligio Russorum Aliae superstitiones," written in 1581.2 1 am indebted to Sir A. Evans for the loan of this book. The passage runs as follows :-Luemn castr-ensen?, quam nostri milites huc advexerant, tali modo eos propqtlsare vidi. Funem accipiunt, eumque per foramiien scamni in domo vetustioris tantisper trahunt et retrahunt. donec ignis scintillamn ex arido assere eliceant: flanmma conspecta, cereumn in delubro undis lustralibus pegfusum accendunt. Omnes deinde qui ex hac favilla prunas vel torremt do?ni conservant, tutos fore credunt a pestife'ra contagione, et fit nonnunquatm,- ut eventus fidei respondeat." The process here described is identical with that already referred to, as occurring in Smaland, in Southern Sweden. A cord was drawn to and fro through a hole in a dry old bench, and from the fire obtained by the friction a wax taper, which had been sprinkled with holy water, was lighted. Embers kindled from this and preserved in the houses, were believed to protect the people from the conitagion of camp- fever; and, as the autlhor dryly remarks, "It sometimes does happen that the result is in keeping with their belief." From the context it may be inferred that the above description applied to Ruthenia (Little Russia). I have now quoted the various references to which I have had access, dealing with the process of fire-making with a flexible sawing-thong, and it will be seen that there are three distinct areas of geographical distribiution. (1) An Easterii area extending from Assam to New Guinea; (2)West Africa; (3)Europe. These three areas must be considered separately, as, in the absence of evidence which might indicate a culture-connection linking them together, we must, provisionally at any rate, regard the use of the sawing-thong in fire-making as having very possibly ,arisen independently in the three regions. The first of these, the EASTERN AREA, in spite of the many gaps which break the continuity ifn distribution of this appliance at the present day, none the less appears very definitely to represent a connected culture-area.

An ethnological study of the flexible fire-saw seems to bring into prominence two of these racial elemeents more especially,-the Indonesian (pre- Malayan) and the Negritic stocks-and it appears probable that to one of these the origin and invention of this variety of the fire-saw is due. Although there are a few variations in matters of detail in the mode of employinent of the apparatus, these are not sufficiently distinct or localized to warrant a theory of independent invention in two or more centres within the Eastern area. As has been seen from the descriptions given above, these variations are nlot as a rule restricted to any special districts, but are liable to recur even in widely separated regions; while such instances as occur of local specialized types-such as the anthropomorphic design of the Kayan fire-stick-are clearly due to an elaboration of the normal and widely-spread form of the apparatus. At one extremity of the range of dispersal in the East are the Tibeto-Burman Nagas and the nearly-related Tipperahs, and they, as well as the Mois of tlhe Annamu frontier, must be linked cultuirally with the Indonesian peoples. There are very strong affinities between the culture of the Nagas alnd that of some of the natives of the Asiatic Islands, notably the natives of Borneo; while striking similarities m-ay be traced from Assam as far east as the Philippines and Melanesia, and eveni further. The coincidences are too numerous to be fortuitous. In the Malay Peninsula, which, presumably, was on the line of route of the early migration from the Asiatic mainland into the Archipelago, we find the Sakai, Semang and Malays all employing the thong-saw. The short-statured, curly-haired Sakai (pre-Dravidian or Dravido-Australoid) appear to have racial affinities with somie primitive peoples in the Asiatic Islands (e.g., Sumatra and Celebes), and even, according to Moszkowski, in New Guinea (Geelvink Bay). The Negritic Semang are akin to the Negritic pygmies, of whom traces may still be found in several of the islands of the Archipelago, and who persist, as a remnant of an early imiimigration, in New Guinea, and still form an important element in the local population. It appears likely that the Malays of the Peninsula derived the thong-sawing process either from the Sakai or the Semang, since, as far as I am aware, there is lno record of this method of fire-production in Sumatra, the original home of the Malays, nor among true Malays elsewhere. In Borneo, the Kayans, according to Hose, probably represent an offshoot fronm the Indonesian migration from the mainland, which spread froom the basin of the Irrawadi, and they have physical as well as cultural affinities with the Nagas. The Kenyahs are believed to have been a still earlier immigrant people exhibiting a blending of Caucasian and Mongoloid elements, who entered Borneo while it was still conlnected with the mainland. Hose is also of opinioln that the Kenyahs lhave derived the principal elements in their culture fronm the Kayans, whose characteristics they have assim-ilated very completely. Probably the use of the</page><page sequence="27">58 HENRY BALFOuR.-Frictional Fire-making thong-saw by these two tribes almost exclusively among the inhabitants of the island is referable to this transmission of cultural elements from the one tribe to the other, and in this case it is likely that this apparatus reached Central Borneo and Sarawak from the S. or S.E. parts of the island, and accompanied the migration of the Kayans along the larger rivers into the uplands of the central region.' The former existence of a Negritic people in Borneo, which although not colnclusively proved, is regarded as highly probable, gives rise to the alternative possibility of the Kayans and Kenyahs having derived the process from an earlier pygmy population, akin to the Semang, and of whom very few traces remain to-day. In the Philipyinies, the flexible fire-saw appears to be associated, mainly at any rate, with tribes of Negritic or partially Negritic stock, though the pre-Malayan, Indonesian element is widely represeiited in the group, strongly tinged with Mon- goloid characteristics; and it may be regarded as an open question, whether the thong-saw was introduced into the Philippines by Indolnesians or by Negritos. The passage from Borneo to the main Philippine group via Palawan and Minidoro would have been ani easy one, the distances by sea being short. When we come to New Guinea, the association of this apparatus with the pygmy Negi,itic race becomes more marked. Although from the descriptions given in this paper it is clear that in certain districts tribes of pure Papuans, or, in some cases, of Papuo-Melanesian stock, practise fire-making by this process, it must be admitted that the thong-saw is more particularly characteristic of the upland pygmy peoples, and of those tribes in whose physique some Negritic features are traceable. It is noteworthy that, with comyiparatively few exceptions, the Papuan and Papuo- Melanesian empLoyers of this systein of fire-makino, inhabit districts where they have been liable to come into contact with peoples whose Negritic affinities are more or less well defined; and in view of the frequenit occurrence of the thong-saw among the upland peoples, usually of low stature and presenting other Negritic tendencies, and also of the fact that the neighbouring taller Papuans and Papuo-Melanesians more usually adopt some other method (e.g., the " fire-plough ")-it appears probable that the flexible.fire-saw was introduced into New Guinea by the early immigrant Negritos, and was transmitted by them to some of the later dominant peoples, as a result of culture-contact. Apart from the general close resemblance observable in the apparatus and in its mode of employment in the two regions, the use of a cane strip in very long lengths, ordinarily kept coiled up for wearing as armlets, affords a striking link between the thong-sawing process in the Philippines and its counter- part in New Guinea, in both of which regions this method of fire-makin, is closely identified with Negrito culture. The final solution of this problem must await further investigation. At one (the north-west) end of the range of its dispersal in the east, the probability of an Indonesian origin of this contrivance is distinctly suggested; while, on the other I Hose and McDougall, The Pagan Tribes of Borneo, chapter on the ethnology of Borneo.</page><page sequence="28">with a Flexible Sawing-thontg. 59 hand, at the other (the east and north-east) end, the Negrito origin is equally definitely indicated. A wider knowledge of Negrito culture and distribution may enlighten us. Both the split and the unsplit forms of the fire-stick or " hearth " occur at the extreme ends of the distribution, and the details of method in the employment of the apparatus, while varyilng locally to some extent, do not present such well-defined variations in the several districts, as to offer any definite clue as to the original home of the system. It seems probable that the flexible fire-saw of the East was invented as a variant from the better-known rigid, blade-like fire-saw. It occurs to a great extent over the same area as is occupied by the latter, the two processes being some- times employed alternatively by the same people. Bamboo, which is the prevailing material employed for both parts of the rigid file-saw, is used, instead of wood, for the " hearth " of the thong-saw by certain tribes (e.g., the Mois and Tipperahs) and occasionally by the Sakai, and this affords a link between the two methods. A further link between the sawing-blade and the sawing-thong methods is suggested by the occasional splitting of the wooden "hearth" sometimes employed with the former, as, for instanice, in Australia. The second distinct area of distribution of the thong-saw-i.e., WEST AFRICA- is a peculiarly isolated one, since, as already stated, the only people in Africa who have been credited with the use of this method of fire-making are the Ba-Kalai of the Ogowe River district. The possibility of an independent origin of the system in this region is forcibly suggested. At the samne time, when we recall tlle numerous striking resemblances observable in the arts anid appliances of native tribes in Africa on the one hand, and those of the Southern Asiatic area and the Malayan Archipelago on the other, it inust be admitted that it is not quite impossible that the Ba-Kalai may owe their acquaintanceship with the thong-saw to somle remote contact with the sources of Asiatic culture, and that there may perhaps, be a true phylogenetic relatioiiship between these now widely separated forms of the apparatus. In connection with the Asiatic and Indonesian elements traceable in African culture, I can only here refer to Dr. L. Frobenius' book' and to a paper by Dr. B. Ankermann.2 The general subject is too wide for me to eniter into it here. The third area to be briefly considered-the EUROPEAN area-is again apparelntly very distinct from and quite unconnected with the other two, as far as the appliance under discussion is concerned. There seems little likelihood of tracing in Europe such affinities with Negritic, Indonesian, pre-Malayan or Bantu culture, as would warrant the suggestion of a probable common origin for the thong-saw of Europe and that of other parts. As far as the records show, the variety of frictional fire-production in Europe is and has been associated almost, if not quite exclusively, with the practice of procuring ceremonial-or need-fire, but for this 1 Ursp} ung dcer IKultur, 1898, vol. i. 2 " Kulturkreise und Kultursehiebten in Africa," in Zeit. f.

This thong- drilling process is widely dispersed in Europe (British Islands, Scandinavia, Switzer- land, Germany, the Balkans, etc.), and it has occurred to me as very possible, that it must frequently have happened that, owing to the spindle becoming jammed, it may have refused to rotate when the thong was pulled. In such an event, the thong would have slipped on the fixed spindle as its enlds were violently tugged alternately, and the friction created by this involuntary sawing of the cord upon the wood, would have caused smoke to arise in a very few seconds, thereby indicating that fire could easily be obtained by this method, as an alternativTe to employing the rotating spindle. The misuse of the one method may so readily have suggested the other, that a theory of the likelihood of the thong-saw having arisen indepen- dently in Europe may be regarded as a perfectly plausible one. In conclusion, let me say that whereas I have endeavoured to bring, together as many references to the use of the thong-sawing method as possible, I alm neverthe- less conscious of the fact that my list is probably far from complete, and that inuch more information and material is probably available. Many unrecorded examples of the apparatus must exist in museums, and there are, no doubt, miany references in literature which I have not yet seenl. I shall feel very grateful for any information which will help in tracing still further the geographical distribution and varieties of this interesting frictional fire-making process, and I trust that at a later stage many of the gaps in the continuity of dispersal nmay be filled up, and sufficient links in the series be forthcomiing to admit of a mole complete and detailed treatment of the subject.</page><page sequence="30">wvith a Flexible Sawing-thong. 61 M r A S E.E.AsIA eTHE ASIATIC.
