PORPHYRY AND DIDYMUS IN DEBATE OVER ALLEGORICAL INTERPRETATION Philip Sellew University of Minnesota Porphyry of Tyre, the disciple of Plotinus who composed his massive work Against the Christians under Diocletian, has attracted much attention in recent years as perhaps the most formidable intellectual opponent of the early church.1 Modem scholars continue to be impressed by Porphyry's knowledge, resource- fulness, and the evident respect shown him by such figures as Jerome and Augustine. Because his literary remains are both fragmentary and disputed, moreover, any new information about Porphyry's views is of considerable importance. Just such a discovery provides the occasion for this essay. Among the papyrus codices found in an ammunition dump near Toura, Egypt, during World War II, were several previously unknown works of Origen and Didymus the Blind.2 Most of these documents have been published only recently, lOn Porphyry in general see esp.

The new fragment was first noted by Gerhard Binder in 1968, a decade prior to the publication of this portion of Didymus's commentary. I shall refer to his various suggestions for the restoration and interpretation of the quotation below.4 In the new testimonium Porphyry appears to propose that the famous con- frontation between Achilles and Hector may be a more appropriate, more Hel- lenic emblem of the spiritual or moral conflict often symbolized in Christian literature as occurring between Christ and the Devil. Indeed the latter was a favorite subject for Christian allegorists, who were able to find references to Satan's dominion over earth while Christ's return was delayed in a host of seemingly innocent scriptural references. Here Porphyry considers whether Christ or Achilles would better represent the ideal of the Good, or of Victory, as well as the alternative of whether the Devil or Hector better symbolizes the notion of a strong, worthy, but ultimately defeated adversary. It is altogether fitting that Porphyry should select two epic heroes as his candidates to replace Christ and the Devil in this emblematic struggle. The Greek tradition of allegor- ical interpretation of Homer, Hesiod, and potentially other authors was highly influential, not only for learned Jewish and Christian analyzers of scripture, but also for Porphyry himself. THE NEW FRAGMENT Didymus's Commentary on Ecclesiastes makes up part of a large papyrus codex of the sixth century that was published in 1979 by a team at Cologne.5 The complete work likely comprised almost 380 pages. Sometime in antiquity the codex suffered the shock of nearly being split in two crosswise by a sharp instrument. Several of the quires have also experienced secondary damage, which makes restoration of some lines difficult. The papyrus was inscribed in a careful hand in scriptio continua: the original scribe made some of his own corrections, and in addition one or more later correctors made various changes in a smaller and more cramped script. The codex itself is a palimpsest; the underwriting was apparently from a documentary scroll. 3Didymus's commentaries are being published at Bonn in the series "Papyrologische Texte und Abhandlungen." The relevant volume is edited by Michael Gronewald: Didymos der Blinde: Kom- mentar zum Ecclesiastes (Tura-Papyrus), vol. 5: Zu Eccl. 9.8-10.20 (Papyrologische Texte und Abhandlungen 24; Bonn: Habelt, 1979). 4Gerhard Binder, "Eine Polemik des Porphyrios gegen die allegorische Auslegung des Alten Testaments durch die Christen," Zeitschrift fur Papyrologie und Epigraphik 3 (1968) 81 -95. 5For the codicological information in what follows see Gronewald, Didymos der Blinde. 80</page><page sequence="3">PHILIP SETI,EWT Even before the material was prepared for its second use and refashioning as a codex, the papyri already had holes in several places, which the newly written text carefully avoids. Perhaps this book was buried as part of a heterodox Ori- genist library after the condemnations of the sixth century; among the 1500 or so additional papyrus leaves discovered in a refilled cache were other commen- taries of Didymus on the biblical books of Psalms, Job, and Zechariah, as well as previously unknown works by Origen. The passage to be discussed here has suffered the usual damage in the middle of the page, where the quotation begins, but beginning with 18 the lines are complete.

And the things that we are accustomed to say about the Devil, he says about Hector, while what we say about Christ, he says about Achilles. And he employs this sort of expression: "Before the victory of Achilles, Hector used to strut before all his foes, and thought himself more powerful than all. But he did this in order to deceive." Here then he finishes with the anagogic interpretation. Often we in fact do violence to the historical letter, not to explicate the narrative, but rather to lead our hearer to understanding, as "Thorns grow in the hand of a drunkard."8 There is of course no difficulty in assigning this new fragment directly to Por- phyry, unlike some others; though its precise textual source is uncertain, the fragment most likely comes from his fifteen-book treatise Against the Christians (Kaxra XptoartavGv). A more interesting question is how to understand the import of this conversation between Porphyry and Didymus. What does it mean when Didymus comments that what Christians say about the Devil and Christ, Porphyry says about Hector and Achilles? DIDYMUS'S DEBATE WITH PORPHYRY Didymus's life spanned the entire fourth century, from his birth in Alexan- dria during the period of the final persecutions, to his death in the 390s under the new Christian empire of Theodosius I.9 Throughout his career as a monk, schol- ar, teacher, and exegete, Didymus remained constant to the Origenist principles of biblical interpretation: always to seek the spiritual and theological implica- tions of the text, not necessarily discarding the literal or surface meaning, but probing more deeply for what he called the "anagogical" and "allegorical" intention beneath the bare "historical" statements.10 Didymus was quite prepared, moreover, to reinterpret the literal sense of a passage quite dramati- 8Prov 26:9; Binder ("Eine Polemik des Porphyrios," 95) cites Origen's treatment of this verse in his Commentary on Genesis 3:21 (PG, 12. 101BC): xEKTcoV Oit o0 &amp;eT zC?pitX?EC alt To0 ypdagwLaTo; ti^ypacpfj; x; a&amp;Xloio, TOv 6 KEKp)V 0aupv v o riv ypdavpaxt nqxev. 90n Didymus's life and career see Johannes Quasten, Patrology, vol. 3: The Golden Age of Greek Patristic Literature (Utrecht/Antwerp: Spectrum, 1960) 85-100, and the convenient sum- mary of more recent discoveries in Frances M.

The section of the commentary where Porphyry is quoted is centered on the interpretation of one verse from "The Preacher," Eccl 9:10, whose second half reads as follows in the Greek version: O1cK OT1tV loirjlra Koia XoyoCtbS Kcal yvt0io Kac oopiola ?v a 'o'o, or ou t coperT CKet. There is no work, thought, knowledge, or wisdom in Hades, where you are going. Didymus's problem in this verse, to which he devotes three full pages of his commentary, is to explicate the spiritual significance of there being "no work, thought, knowledge, or wisdom in Hades," that is, in Sheol, the realm of the dead. His solution, briefly stated, is to argue that true "death" is not physical death, but sinfulness. Thus "Hades" is not a physical place, but a spiritual state. He argues this based on the contention that to claim that there is no Xoytoao6g, no reasoning, in Hades, is false, even though this is the literal state- ment of the biblical text. Didymus employs the principle of interpreting one passage in Scripture from another-a device well known from the practice of solving Homeric problems. 1 Didymus can cite examples of human beings "rea- soning," even conversing, from the realm of the dead, such as the rich man who appears to Lazarus in Luke 16. He also examines a presumably troublesome statement in Ps 6:6 (6:5), which reads: "In death there is no remembrance of you; in Sheol who can give you praise?" He claims that since the patriarch Abraham praises God from the afterlife, therefore this verse too speaks not of a physical death, but a death from the true life of righteousness. Didymus then turns to an excursus discussing and defending this sort of search for a more "spiritual" understanding, and it is here that he quotes Por- phyry on allegorism. In my view Porphyry is proposing the pair of Achilles and Hector as an alternative set of symbolic enemies to the pair of Jesus and Satan. Didymus explains that what Christians say about Christ and the Devil, Porphyry says about the Homeric heroes. Porphyry has in mind those passages in the Iliad where Hector is wreaking tremendous destruction on the Greek army while Achilles has absented himself; similarly, Satan has free rein on earth while be- lievers await Christ's return. One thinks of Ajax's appeal to Achilles to rejoin the battle in Iliad 9.236ff., or, quite plainly, the closing lines of Book 12, where Hector leads a successful breach of the Greek defenses (lines 436-71).

No one could have stood up against him, and stopped him, except the gods, when he burst in the gates; and his eyes flashed fire.'2 Compare 9.237ff.: Hector, in the huge pride of his strength, rages irresistibly reliant on Zeus, and gives way to no one, neither god nor man, but the strong fury has de- scended upon him.'3 These references in Homer, suggested by Binder,14 are enlightening, but we may still ask what Christian discussion of Christ and the Devil Porphyry might have been responding to. Binder's own attempt to provide an explanatory context refers to passages in Origen and Didymus where a verse in Job about one who is to conquer the mythic sea monster is explained as symbolic of Christ's victory over Satan.15 I do not find this tradition entirely satisfactory or appropriate in connection with the pairing of combatants that Porphyry and Didymus are dis- cussing. What in this conversation compels an equation of Hector = Satan = Leviathan? More problematic still in Binder's interpretation is the assumption that Porphyry's whole intention in making this symbolic suggestion was parody, to argue by ridicule, to provide a more or less humorous dismissal of the absurdi- ties of his opponents' allegorical interpretation. Binder says that Porphyry's comment is intended to "expose the allegorical method of the Christians as non- sense." By applying the Christians' method to Homeric texts, Porphyry shows his reader "to what absurd consequences" the principles of allegorical interpre- tation lead.16 This explanation of Porphyry's motives is based on some miscon- ceptions commonly held about the value given the allegorical method in late antiquity as well as about the complex history of controversy over correct interpretation to which Porphyry was heir.

PORPHYRY IN THE HISTORY OF ALLEGORICAL INTERPRETATION In the early centuries of the Common Era there was a long and often bitter debate over the proper method of interpreting the Bible. Among Christians and Jews, pagans and believers, questions arose about the purpose and meaning of scripture. On one side, Jews like Philo of Alexandria and Christians like Cle- ment, Origen, and Didymus the Blind argued that because the biblical authors were divinely inspired, the true import of their writings must often lie deep beneath the surface; hence biblical expositors were obligated to use the most advanced interpretive methods available in order to discover and elucidate that hidden significance. For Philo, Clement, Origen, and Didymus, who were all residents of Alexandria, the most appropriate tool was the allegorical method of interpretation, a device of Hellenic culture developed long since to explicate the poets. Arguing a contrary position were such critics of Christianity as Celsus, an eclectic Platonist of the time of Marcus Aurelius, and especially Porphyry of Tyre. One of the more interesting aspects of this long conversation is that the opposing figures can often be understood only in light of the response of their rivals. Celsus, for example, seems to be motivated in the writing of his True Discourse largely by the allegorical speculations of someone like Philo of Alex- andria, or the often strained christological readings of Old Testament passages by such Christian apologists as Aristides or Justin Martyr.17 Celsus's own con- tribution18 survives due to the detailed refutation of the True Discourse written some seventy years later by Origen, just at the outbreak of the Decian persecu- tion.19 As for Porphyry, he had met Origen personally and received a lasting impression of his erudition; he was moved to write his anti-Christian works in large part due to that scholar's lasting impact decades after his death. Porphyry's polemics in turn survive by virtue of his own detractors and opponents, including Didymus. '7Carl Andresen (Logos und Nomos: Die Polemik des Kelsos wider das Christentum [Arbeiten zur Kirchengeschichte 30; Berlin: De Gruyter, 1955]) argues that Celsus is responding directly to Justin; see the detailed discussion in Henry Chadwick, Early Christian Thought and the Classical Tradition: Studies in Justin, Clement and Origen (Oxford: Clarendon, 1966) 133. 18The Greek text of the 'AXrl0iS; Ao'yo must be reconstructed from Origen's reply (see next note).

Thus the myths and poems could be allegorized not merely to gloss over problems, but also for more positive pur- poses. The Stoics came to be especially skilled at finding evidence of cosmo- logical, theological, physical, and even geographical doctrine. The etymological interpretation of names had analogous purposes and held a similar attraction for both Jewish and Christian exegetes. Although the allegorical method of interpretation never won universal accep- tance in antiquity, at the start of the Christian era it was nonetheless the dom- inant scientific device to aid in understanding the true significance of ancient texts now far removed from their original contexts. Leading Academics could contemplate the myths of Plato, though the master himself had disapproved of the method on the grounds that the true philosopher must not be subordinate to external opinion,22 and thus should not need to divine the supposed inner mean- ings of even the most sacred texts. This did not dissuade the middlebrow Pla- tonist Plutarch from an elaborate allegorical interpretation of hellenized Egyp- 20For what follows see John Tate, "On the History of Allegorism," Classical Quarterly 28 (1934) 105-14; Felix Buffiere, Les mythes d'Homere et la pensee grecque (Paris: Les Belles Let- tres, 1956); Jean P6pin, Mythe et allegorie: les origines grecques et les contestations judeo- chretiennes (Paris: Aubier, 1958); Rudolf Pfeiffer, History of Classical Scholarship: From the Beginnings to the End of the Hellenistic Age (Oxford: Clarendon, 1968); Lamberton, Homer the Theologian.

Although his publication of the Vita and Plotinus's Enneads was Porphyry's most lasting contribution to philosophy, much of his other work is also impor- tant to historians of ancient religion. We learn that in the middle of the third century he went to Athens to study with Cassius Longinus, a man whom Plo- tinus called a good philologist, but no philosopher.27 Porphyry must have gained much from his association with Longinus and will have departed Athens well equipped with literary and historical skills. When he came under the influence of Plotinus at Rome, Porphyry may have turned most of his energies to other pursuits, but the philological training he had received remained of vital impor- tance for his subsequent role as a critic of Christian learning. From the well developed practice of Homeric criticism Porphyry learned the techniques of discovering problems in a text, as well as the means to resolve those problems or to explain them away. He displayed this critical ability in his detailed works on questions in the Iliad and the Odyssey known as the Homeric 23Plutarch Moralia 351c-384c, nepi a'Io;6 Kai 'OolptSoq-text and translation available in LCL vol. 306 (ed.

Porphyry showed similar skill in editing and present- ing anew a variety of traditional religious utterances in his work called the Phi- losophy from Oracles.29 Thus when he turned to analysis of the Bible, Porphyry was armed with the tools of the Hellenic critical tradition for use in his attacks on the Hebrew prophets, the gospel writers, and Paul. PORPHYRY'S ENCOUNTER WITH ORIGEN Indeed it was in opposition to Christianity that Porphyry made what must surely be his most original contributions as a representative of late antique Hel- lenism. Much of his effectiveness as an opponent of the church was due to his intimate knowledge of the Bible and its exposition, and in fact he was apparently quite knowledgeable about Christianity from an early age. The church historian Eusebius of Caesarea has preserved for us Porphyry's own account of how, as a young man, he met Origen, the greatest Christian scholar of antiquity;30 and we lear how impressed he was with Origen's familiarity with "Greek," that is to say, Middle Platonic thought. As best we can tell, Por- phyry made a special effort to journey from Tyre to visit Origen before begin- ning his literary studies at Athens. The most likely site of their encounter is Caesarea Maritima, the Judean provincial capital founded as a Greek polis by Herod at the time of Augustus, and reestablished as a Roman colony by Vespa- sian. Caesarea, which was thus technically Hellenic and Roman in character, was in Porphyry's day populated largely by a mixture of Jews, Samaritans, and Christians.31 It was to this city that Origen had come, after his difficulties with Bishop Demetrius of Alexandria, in order to establish a center for Christian learning and advanced scriptural study. We have a valuable glimpse of Origen's scholarly and theological concerns in his new setting from the pen of one of his students in Caesarea, Gregory Thaumatourgos. In an oration of thanks delivered before his return home, Gregory extols the rigorous course of spiritual and 28Texts available in Hermann Schrader, ed., Porphyrii Quaestionum homericarum ad Iliadem pertinentium reliquias (Leipzig: Teubner, 1880-82) and Porphyrii Quaestionum homericarum ad Odysseam pertinentium reliquias (Leipzig: Teubner, 1890); also A.

The context, as quoted by Eusebius, is Porphyry's attempt to trace back to Origen himself the Christian application of allegorical methods of interpretation to the scriptures: "But this kind of absurdity," says Porphyry,33 must be traced to a man whom I met when I was still quite young, who had a great reputation, and still holds it, because of the writings he has left behind him. I mean Origen, whose fame has been widespread among the teachers of this kind of learning.... While his manner of life was Christian and thus contrary to the laws, in his opinions about material things and the Deity he played the Hellene, and introduced Greek ideas into foreign fables. For he was always consorting with Plato, and was conversant with the writ- ings of Numenius and Cronius, ... and the distinguished men among the Pythagoreans; and he also used the books of Chaeremon the Stoic and Cor- nutus, from whom he learned the figurative interpretation, as employed in the Greek mysteries, and applied it to the Jewish writings. The work of Porphyry from which Eusebius quotes here is generally agreed to have been his treatise Against the Christians.34 This work was apparently devoted almost entirely to learned and acute criticism of the Jewish and Chris- tian scriptures, raising pointed objections to historical contradictions, scientific implausibilities, and moral improprieties.35 Some suppose that Porphyry was 32Gregory Thaumatourgos Oratio Panegyrica in Origenem (PG 10. 1051 -1106).

It may well be, ironically enough, that Porphyry obtained much of his information for his attack on biblical questions from Origen himself and from his many writ- ings of biblical and theological scholarship. Recent dismissal of Porphyry's cri- ticisms as trivial and pedantic betrays a lack of understanding about the nature of the genre of rirnTiata or "Questions" on an authoritative text.37 Alongside this sort of detailed philological commentary, Porphyry also produced major works of philosophical and literary interpretation, and it is unfair or uninformed to accuse him of having an overly pedantic or wooden mind. PORPHYRY'S WORK AGAINST THE CHRISTIANS We can take it as a sign of respect that just as Porphyry had hinted that Ori- gen was in truth a Greek thinker only masquerading as a Christian theologian, so too Porphyry's Christian opponents often charged that he had once been a be- liever himself, who had apostasized after some unfortunate incident or maltreat- ment.38 To be sure, converts are often the most fanatic and well-informed opponents of their former faith, as the comparative history of religion well shows; yet in this case I suspect that the later church tradition reveals little more than grudging respect or even thinly veiled admiration for the depth of Porphyry's understanding. This work Against the Christians, as well as Porphyry's probably earlier and only implicitly polemical Philosophy from Ora- cles, caused great embarrassment and distress to the church. Both of these works were removed from circulation by a series of increasingly effective imperial proscriptions, beginning with Constantine I in 324, just before the Council of Nicaea, and ending with a decree of burning by Theodosius II and Valentinian III in 448.39 Porphyry's anti-Christian works, regrettably, are thus extant only as quoted, summarized, or refuted by his later opponents, chiefly in the works of Eusebius and Augustine. Other important evidence comes from Jerome's Commentary on Daniel, the writings of Didymus the Blind, the Eclo- gae of Stobaeus, and, less directly, from the Apocriticus or "Response" of one and of Mark (1:2-3) for quoting as Isaiah alone a text derived partly from Malachi (3:1) and partly from Isaiah (40:3). See Anastos, "Porphyry's Attack," 426. These criticisms were quoted by Jerome (Comm. in Ps. 77, PL. 26. 1108BC and Comm. in Matth. 1:3, PL. 26. 29-30), who explained the mistakes as due to copyists' errors. 36See most recently P.

In particular, Barnes has questioned the relia- bility of modem attempts to assign to Porphyry the later summary references to anti-Christian polemic, for example in Macarius; the Apocriticus presents detailed objections to Christianity and its scripture in the literary guise of a dialogue, without, however, identifying the sources or origins of the objections articulated by its "Greek philosopher."41 Barnes has also emphasized the prob- lems associated with deciding from which of Porphyry's several works a partic- ular fragment may come. The bulk of scholarship has too readily relied upon the collection of fragments assembled seventy years ago by Adolf von Har- nack.42 Nearly half of Hamack's material stems from Macarius, which means that although the quoted material may well represent the substance and tendency of Porphyry's remarks, at least indirectly, they will only doubtfully provide us with his precise words. Rather than adopt Bares's complete skepticism, how- ever, I choose to use Macarius, but only with such material as is coherent with attitudes otherwise known to be Porphyry's. It is only through the analysis of new material, such as we are now discovering in Didymus's biblical commen- taries, that any real progress can be made. As the collection of texts found at Toura is published in full and becomes better known among scholars, further light will be shed on this long-standing argument over allegorical interpretation of the Bible, both among various Christian groups or schools and between Christians and Hellenes. 40On the complicated literary problems see esp. Barnes, "Porphyry Against the Christians"; Wilken, "Pagan Criticism"; Croke, "Porphyry's Chronology" and "Era of Porphyry's Polemic." Among the older literature, see the conversation among Georg Schalkhauser (Zu den Schriften des Makarios von Magnesia [TU 31/4; Leipzig: Hinrichs, 1907]), Crafer ("The Work of Porphyry" and "Macarius Magnes, a Neglected Apologist" [JTS 8 (1907) 401-23; 546-71]), Geffcken (Zwei griechische Apologeten), and Harnack (Kritik des Neuen Testaments von einem griechischen Philo- sophen des 3. Jahrhunderts [TU 37/4; Leipzig: Hinrichs, 1911] and Porphyrius "Gegen die Christen," 15 Biicher). Barnes covers similar territory in refuting Harnack's complex literary solu- tion, but without mentioning Crafer. Binder and Gronewald seem unaware of critical developments subsequent to Harnack. 41Barnes, "Porphyry Against the Christians."

Porphyry and Celsus, his predecessor in philosophic opposition to the church, both objected that the "more educated" among the Jews and Christians misap- plied his method to scripture. Their protests were twofold: first, the inter- preters' motivation was inappropriate, namely, they sought merely to escape embarrassment over contradictions, impieties, and other internal difficulties; and second, the text being interpreted was itself inappropriate, because it was morally and aesthetically deficient and because its authors had not intended it to be understood allegorically. Origen and his successors replied to both charges by stressing the sacred, ancient, poetic, and oracular nature of the Bible as the storehouse for God's "hidden treasure of knowledge," and thus the need to plumb its depths through allegorical exegesis. It was clear to Porphyry from his extensive firsthand knowledge that there was much of value in the Jewish scriptures, especially in some of the prophetic writings, and that they in some sense proclaimed the One High God that he too reverenced.43 But Porphyry was also strongly repelled by much of the Bible, particularly by its anthropomorphic images of God, its frequent anti-universal- istic or even ethnocentric tendencies, and by such occasional episodes as Lot impregnating his own daughters in Genesis 19. Porphyry could not understand why the Christians did not simply reject the Jewish writings as no longer being religiously appropriate.44 Porphyry took over from Christian apologetics and its reading of the Hebrew prophets the notion that the Jews had lost the essence and potency of divine revelation; he saw Jesus as one who taught a simpler, more direct religious path. Augustine has preserved Porphyry's claim that it was Jesus' disciples and their successors who misunderstood his message and employed complex "Greek" methods of interpretation to what was clear and straightforward discourse.45 While the Christians erred in retaining the Old Testament's authoritative status, they also were mistaken in digging for deeper, spiritual meanings in Jesus' say- ings and stories. Porphyry apparently understood that Jesus himself had dis- cerned a pitiable lack of comprehension among his followers, as we see in a fragment preserved by Macarius that likely summarizes his comments on the following saying from Matt 11:15:46 43This is acknowledged by Augustine De civ. dei 19.22- 23. 44Apparently Porphyry did not know of the Marcionite Christians and their rejection of the Old Testament. 45E.g., Augustine De consensu evangelistarum 1.15 (23); cf. 1.7 (10-12). 46Macarius Magnes 4.9 (Hamack, Porphyrius, 79, frg. 52): Eosokoyooucal' oot, TnCdEp, KUcptE TO) o6)pavo) Kai y5iq, rtc KP oti Kpvlai; TaTXa (5o oocp(0v Kai oT)VE?)V, Kati aExcdauX\(aS acta&amp; vqcloti .... oGca(?oTpa oov 0?8 ?tVati Koa OUK aoiviy7aTzo) r TOS xoS VTlIotLS Koal a(uv?Tov ; ypa(p6ou?va- ?i y&amp;p 6dco 6 tV ooqcpov K?KpunTCTal Ta lucxTncrpla, v1t1iot; &amp; Kai 1n,a rl ou?ivotg; aXoyo; ?KK?rcXTat, P?ETIov T iv aXoyiav rylkov OvKal TxV &amp;acaOltav. This fragment is quoted by Michael 92</page><page sequence="15">PHILIP SE I IFW Jesus said: "I thank you, Father, lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from wise and understanding people and revealed them to babes." Therefore the things that are written for babes and the ignorant ought to be clearer and not wrapped in riddles; for if the mysteries have been hidden from the wise, and unreasonably poured out to babes and those who give suck, it is better to be desirous of senselessness and ignorance. Porphyry is thus suspicious of the authenticity of the parables ascribed to Jesus in the gospels, since they seem too obscure to have been intended for his "child- like" followers. With reference to the similitudes of the kingdom of heaven in Matthew 13, Macarius has preserved the following comment, which I quote only in part:47 When someone has a message to give concerning great and divine matters, he is obliged to make use of common things that pertain to human beings, in order to make his meaning clear, but not such degraded and unintelligible things as these.... These sayings, besides being base and unsuitable to such matters, have in themselves no intelligent meaning or clarity. And yet it was fitting that they should have been very clear indeed, because they were not written for the wise and understanding, but for babes. Porphyry has in fact singled out here a major problem in early Christianity having to do with the true character of Jesus' teaching: were his intended mean- ings "simple" and "clear" or were they "mysterious" and "dark"? The interpretation of parables made this question particularly pressing and was a major point of disagreement among Christian exegetes.48 Porphyry most likely drew on Origen's writings not only to learn about Christian doctrine on specific questions, but also as a prime source for examples of problems and difficulties in scriptural interpretation. Robert Grant has proposed, for example, that Por- phyry used Origen's collection of biblical and theological questions or aporiae, the Stromateis (no longer extant) for his work Against the Christians, which is Gronewald, "Porphyrios' Kritik an den Gleichnissen des Evangeliums," Zeitschrift fur Papyrologie und Epigraphik 3 (1968) 96.

If Porphyry was aware of Origen's explanation for Jesus' teaching in par- ables, however, he remained unmoved. In Book 11 of his Commentary on Matthew, for example, Origen had claimed that Jesus intended to tell stories with a common-sense moral for his "simpler" listeners, but at the same time to intrigue his more "pneumatic" followers with hints of a deeper, more mystical meaning. Since it appeared from the New Testament gospels that most of Jesus' explanations of the inner meaning of the parables were given orally to his disci- ples while in private and were not recorded,5? they remained as esoteric knowledge (yvCixc) and were lost to later generations. These deeper meanings could only be recovered by immense intellectual and spiritual effort.51 For Ori- gen and his followers the distinction between "simple" and "spiritual" believ- ers lasted down into their own times, and this in part justified their use of allegorical exegesis. Porphyry also believed that higher truths were only attain- able via extraordinary efforts and even mystical means, as his comments in the Philosophy from Oracles show,52 but of course the interpreter must use appropriate source texts when attempting spiritual askesis. It is in this context that Porphyry's famous comment about Origen as a lead- ing Christian allegorist should be understood. In his disagreement over exegeti- cal method, Porphyry does not chide Origen and his fellow Christians for the use of allegorical interpretation in itself, but rather for their use of the method with texts manifestly unsuited to it. The Jewish writings were morally unworthy, while Jesus' teachings were intended to be understood by the sim- plest of believers, which made allegorical interpretation useless and even dangerously misleading. Once again I shall quote only part of the fragment, this time preserved by Eusebius:53 49R. M. Grant, "The Stromateis of Origen," in J. Fontaine and C. Kannengiesser, eds., Epektasis: Melanges patristiques offerts au Cardinal Jean Danielou (Paris: Beauchesne, 1972) 285-92. 50E.g., Mark 4:10-12, 33-34 and parallels. 51On Origen's interpretive methods, see, e.g., Hanson, Allegory and Event; Torjesen, Hermeneuti- cal Procedure. 52See, e.g., Porphyry's opening remarks to his collection as preserved in Eusebius Praep. evang. 4.7: "And the utility which this collection possesses will be best known to as many as have ever been in travail with the truth, and prayed that by receiving the manifestation of it from the gods they might gain relief from their perplexity by virtue of the trustworthy teaching of the speakers" (trans.

For they boast that the things said plainly by Moses are riddles, treating them as divine oracles full of hidden mysteries, and bewitching the mental judgment by their own pretentious obscurity; and so they put forward their interpretations.... But this kind of absurdity must be traced to a man whom I met when I was still quite young, who had a great reputation,... I mean Origen.... There follows the remark of Porphyry that I introduced earlier, which continues with the accusation that Origen's methods are nothing more than watered down Hellenic philosophizing.54 Porphyry's accusation that Origen learned this method from Greek allegorists, particularly the Stoic interpreters of Homer, is of course correct, though the influence was not so direct. Origen (and his Christian predecessors, such as Clement) came to regard the method as fruitful for biblical exegesis through the successful example of their Hellenistic Jewish counterparts in scriptural exposition, Philo being the leading example. That is to say, Origen learned the allegorical method from the Hellenes, but he approved of it only at second hand. Although a modern historian of allegorism would not give Origen all the credit for initiating the method in the exposition of Christian texts, Porphyry's mistake or hyperbole can easily be explained in light of Origen's enormous influence and literary production (aop6opa e'8oi6tgion avTo; c(Xi (tt fi' &amp;v a Jtaa otrEv o,yypaLtad(ov e6Soictgovv og). Origen had encountered similar arguments in the course of his own work, and we are fortunate to have a detailed record of both sides of the dialogue in his work Against Celsus, written late in his career.55 Celsus had also commented on the Jewish and Christian manner of expositing the Bible. He admits that it is at least "the more intelligent" among his opponents who allegorize their books, "but this is an impossible task," he says, "for the books themselves are exceed- ingly simple and straightforward, and those who allegorize them are therefore 54It is not necessary to believe (1) that there was only one man named Origen who studied with Ammonius Saccas, so that later Neoplatonic references to an "Origen" are actually unwittingly quoting the Christian theologian; or, even less, the other extreme (2) that there were not only two Origens, but also two teachers named Ammonius, each with his own Origen as pupil. For the recent discussion see Franz Heinrich Kettler, "Origenes, Ammonius Sakkas und Porphyrius," in A. M.

One of the chief items of controversy was the choice of texts in and through which to find deeper truths. Celsus's and Porphyry's complaints that the method has been applied to an unworthy text are strikingly similar to the Academicians' charges against the Stoic allegorists of Homer, another "immoral" author.59 Not only did Celsus claim that the text allegorized by the Jews and Christians was inappropriate, he also maintained that the results were ludicrous and even worse than the bare narratives they had begun with:60 He seems to me [says Origen] to have heard also that there are treatises con- taining allegories of the law. But if he had read them he would not have said: "At any rate, the allegories which seem to have been written about them are far more shameful and preposterous than the myths, since they connect with some amazing and utterly senseless folly ideas which cannot by any means be made to fit." Origen assumes that Celsus is referring to the works of Philo or perhaps even to the Christian Gnostics, but he cannot imagine that his opponent has actually read the works themselves, since "in many places they are so successful that even Greek philosophers would have been won over by what they say" (?nei inoX- XaZoi oi0ToD; Entl:TEe)XOat gaLOt (paiveTal, (oaTE aipeEfiva( av Kai TOi); ev "E'tXXil (pqXoopooq vTa; &amp;dvc SCov X?yog?voCv). 56This is Grant's summary, Letter and Spirit, 28. 57The case for Celsus knowing Philo's works, and even borrowing from them for arguments against the historical sense of the Pentateuch is made in E.

Por- phyry wanted to understand the Jewish and Christian scriptures in their straight- forward, literal sense; in the case of the Old Testament this led him to reject the writings as unsuitable for religious philosophy. As for the New Testament, as I have mentioned, he was suspicious of the accuracy with which the apostles transmitted the true message of Jesus: they had turned an important and admir- able sage into a god. In the formulation preserved by Macarius: "the evangel- ists were inventors and not historians of the events concerning Jesus" (zoi; e?6a'ayy TaoS; ?peupe'r?T oi0 i'loopaS T&amp;v irpi Tbv Irlooiv yEyevijoat a pdecov).61 In fragments from the Philosophy from Oracles preserved by Augustine, Porphyry seems to give Jesus a very honored place indeed, equivalent perhaps even with such divinized heroes as Asklepios and Orpheus.62 He stressed the dramatic transformation that Christianity had effected on the ori- ginal call of Jesus to an ethically based, monotheistic faith, now become a bar- baric, magic-loving, dualistic system destructive of both society and philosophy. The Christians misinterpreted the various categories of being that mediated between the divine and human realms, to the point that they worshiped angels and demonized the spirits. Part of this unfortunate shift away from the more honorable way of Jesus was due to the Christians' mishandling of texts. Porphyry was a severe historical critic of pseudepigraphical writings (as were other students of Plotinus), using theological arguments to prove, for example, that the Apocalypse of Zoroaster was a forgery.63 He also trained his historical and chronological skills on writings of more direct political relevance, the most famous being his criticism of the Old Testament book of Daniel, which he correctly placed in the reign of Antiochus IV Epiphanes, the Seleucid ruler of Syria 175-163 BCE, nearly four centuries after its pseudepigraphic date under Cyrus the Persian.64 Instead of being an ancient seer foretelling future events, whom the Christians of Porphyry's time were using as a source for messianic prophecies and eschatological comfort under pressure from their own "wicked 6tMacarius Magnes 2.12 (Crafer, Apocriticus, 38). 62Augustine De civ. dei 19.23. 63Vita Plotini 16. 64On Porphyry's critique of Daniel, see Geffcken, Last Days of Paganism; Jay Braverman, Jerome's Commentary on Daniel: A Study of Comparative Jewish and Christian Interpretations of the Hebrew Bible (CBQMS 7; Washington: Catholic Biblical Association, 1978) 116-17; Paolo Frassinetti, "Porfirio esegeta del profeta Daniele," Istituto Lombardo 86 (1953) 194-210; Croke, "Porphyry's Anti-Christian Chronology." 97</page><page sequence="20">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW king," he showed that Ps.-Daniel was in essence describing prior history and the events of his own day.65 CONCLUSION The context provided by this debate confirms my interpretation of the new fragment. We cannot fully understand the conversation between Didymus and Porphyry apart from the pattern of interlocking discussion that I have sketched. As the decades and centuries pass, representatives of the pagan culture appear less and less sure of themselves, while the Christian thinkers slowly gain increasing confidence in the role of their own "philosophy" as the true and authentic culmination of Hellenic civilization. Second-century apologists like Justin Martyr are strikingly defensive about their understandings of Christianity vis-a-vis the literary and philosophic Greco-Roman tradition. Even in the case of Tertullian, much of his bristling arrogance presumably is fueled by similar self-conceptions. But with Origen, as E. R. Dodds has remarked, we now encounter a Christian theologian and ideologue who can articulate with great confidence how his understanding of Plato, to mention only the most important example, is both proper and reasonable.66 A generation or two after Origen's death, at the close of the third century, other factors of a more socio-political aspect have become important. Christianity no longer fits Celsus's picture of an isolated minority movement of the unlettered and disenfranchised. So when Porphyry attempts to re-present pagan religious philosophy in his work on orac- ular texts he seems compelled to find some suitable place for Jesus among humankind's inspired sages; when he turns to critique the scriptures, and espe- cially their interpretation by Christian theologians, he is not sneering at the uncouth and ignorant in the manner of Celsus; instead he is engaging in dialogue with partners he senses might very well be his intellectual peers. 65Jerome has preserved major chunks of Porphyry's arguments and summarizes them in the pro- logue to his Commentary on Daniel (PL, 25. 491C). Casey ("Porphyry and the Origin of the Book of Daniel") has argued (1) that Porphyry relied on Syriac-language traditional exegesis of Daniel for his information, and (2) that he was not completely successful in his chronological placement of the pseudepigraph; on the first point see the criticisms of Arthur J.

There is an excellent discussion of the broader question of relation to authoritative tradi- tion in later Platonism in Armstrong's essay "Pagan and Christian Traditionalism in the First Three Centuries A.D.," StPatr 15.1 (TU 128; ed. E. A. Livingstone; Berlin: Akademie-Verlag, 1984) 414-31. 98</page><page sequence="21">PHILIP SEITI EW Therefore I do not read his attempt to make Achilles and Hector symbolic of moral or spiritual combat as pure and simple sarcasm, as ridicule of his Chris- tian opponents, though this is how Binder and seemingly also Barnes have understood him. This approach hardly makes sense of Didymus's apparent charge that Porphyry's attack on Christian use of allegorical interpretation rather hypocritically ignores his own use of the method. As mentioned earlier, Binder claims that Porphyry's comment is intended to "expose the allegorical method of the Christians as nonsense." By applying the Christians' method to Homeric texts, Porphyry shows his reader "to what absurd consequences" the principles of allegorical interpretation lead.67 I would argue instead that once one has appreciated the depth of Porphyry's sincerity in attempting to find positive results in his "modernization" of traditional poetic and religious material, as is evident throughout his Philosophy from Oracles and to a lesser extent in the Homeric Problems, it seems more fitting to take his words here at face value. Other Hellenic interpreters are known to have given symbolic value to epic heroes, especially Achilles as the paradigm of the conquering hero.68 In the Cave of the Nymphs Porphyry himself rehearses the stock philosophical theme of Odysseus as emblem of the human voyage of spiritual discovery.69 Porphyry was surely familiar with the great emphasis Christians put on inter- preting spiritual struggle through the cosmic duel of Satan, the fallen angel, and Jesus, the Son of God, about to reappear as victor. Such discussions are fre- quent in Origen's works, including his handbook of theological doctrine, On First Principles, in his Commentary on Matthew, and especially in his apolo- getic work Against Celsus, where in Book 6 there is an extended discussion of Celsus's criticism of Christian teaching about Satan.70 The gospel accounts of Jesus' temptation by Satan7l most likely helped fan this interest, or, in view of the increased apocalyptic fervor of some Christians during the period of renewed persecutions, perhaps the more complicated symbolic pictures in 2 Thessalonians or the Apocalypse of John. In light of this ongoing discussion, Porphyry suggests the suitability of these Homeric figures as perhaps a more "ecumenical" pairing for the philosophical and religious truth that is trying to be expressed. Presumably we need not take Didymus's words to mean that Porphyry intended his pair of opponents to be a precise equivalent to the Christian duel of Jesus and Satan. In particular, 67Binder, "Eine Polemik des Porphyrios," 93-94. 68E.g., Achilles = the sun and Hector = the moon; see now more generally Katherine Callen King, Achilles: Paradigms of the War Hero from Homer to the Middle Ages (Berkeley: University of Cali- fornia Press, 1987). 69See esp.

The scholarly tradition upon which Porphyry drew was nonetheless very impressed with the "irrational barbarity" of the fury of Hector's onslaughts.72 One scholiast even comments that Homer in fact intends to portray Hector as possessed by a demon,73 but Porphyry's 5aixgove; (which he discusses at some length in the Philosophy from Oracles) are by no means equivalent to the Chris- tians' evil demons. What we read instead is a protest against the use of Chris- tian myth and especially biblical story to symbolize what Porphyry would want to discover in the divine Homer. Although we cannot be sure of his full inten- tion, given the nature of the surviving fragment, it appears that the suggestion of Porphyry to which Didymus refers was not merely an ad hoc jest. Much more likely it was an integral part of his own work. In a manner fully consonant with his philosophical and religious program, he attempts to find more appropriate language and symbols to replace what he sees as the crude and exaggerated claims of Christians about Jesus. He even uses the conventional wordplay of etymological interpreters when he claims that "Hector did this in order to deceive" (8tapaeliv). For better or worse, Christian exegetes, including Didymus the Blind, were not dissuaded from their own allegorical imaginings by Porphyry's valiant attempt at counter-allegorism.74 72See, e.g., the scholiast tradition about Hector's psychological state and martial excellence (scho- lia in Codex B on 11. 11.269; in Codex A on 13.137, discussed by Robin R. Schlunk, The Homeric Scholia and the Aeneid [Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1974] 41 -43). 73Cf. Schlunk's note: "Schol.

This presumably means no more than that he comes on 'like one possessed,' i.e., of an 'evil spirit,' such as Allecto" (The Homeric Scholia, 125-26 n. 14). 74Different versions of this essay were read as public lectures at the University of Minnesota and the University of California, Berkeley.
