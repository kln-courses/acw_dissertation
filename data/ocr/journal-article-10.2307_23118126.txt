<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews Open Fields: Science in Cultural Encounter by Gillian Beer. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1996. Pp. x + 341; 6 illustrations; index. $45.00. The fourteen chapters of this volume are all reprints of previously pub lished articles or book chapters that appeared over a roughly seven-year span—from the publication of the seminal volume One Culture, edited by George Levine (Beer's Chapter 7), to the publication of Ambix, 41 (March 1994 [Beer's Chapter 14]). Despite their various origins, the essays do hold up as a collection, in large measure because Beer frames them astutely as "all concerning] the crossings we make as readers between fields (some times, it seems, on open ground or over stiles, sometimes crouching behind barbed wire or plucked by brambles)" (1). The particular strength of Beer's Open Fields, as the title and the metaphorical exfoliation cited above suggest, is in her categorical unwillingness to permit any consideration of the episte mological without simultaneously considering the ontological. One comes to know what s/he knows by traversing—and in the process, negotiating—cul tural spaces that mediate, and ultimately transform what s/he knows. This process holds true no less for the scientist coming to do science than for the novelist coming to do fiction. Beer's focal interest, therefore, is on the subject position, and specifically on "the intimacy between intellectual issues and emotional desires and fears" (8). While providing her with an horizon adequate to engaging the texts she selects, Beer's focus raises two questions, that to her own mind "haunt this collection of essays: How does human encounter, actual or imagined, play into the making of theory? How do people reach new ideas within language, which is so freighted with communal pasts? Together, these raise further questions: about scientific writing and the depth to which it is^mbued with cultural experience; about the capacity of human beings to resporid to fresh knowledge as experience" (9). As befits the author of Darwin s Plots (1983), the first section, containing six of the fourteen essays collected—nearly half of the present volume—con cerns itself with "Darwinian Encounters." The first essay, "Four Bodies on the Beagle: Touch, Sight, and Writing in a Darwinian Letter," focuses on a letter by Darwin "addressed to his school and college friend Charles Whitley" (21). The letter contains a puzzling passage that links Darwin, as writerly body, with the body of a Fuegian, who gazes at him; with the body of Titian's Venus (i.e., Venus and Cupid with a Lute-Player), who gazes side long out of the picture plane; and with the body of a "small animal," gaze less because dead (presumably, shot by Darwin himself), that Darwin envisions eviscerating to prepare as a zoological specimen. Beer reads the passage as attempting to mediate Darwin's "sense of fascinated helplessness at finding himself unable to interpret the profound difference of the other man (i.e., the Fuegian)" (25). In his state of helplessness, Darwin recalls the other bodies as a way of trying out an erotics of interpretation versus an ad versative struggle of interpretation, ultimately writing himself into a state in which the gaze is averted; the pleasure of the gaze, subverted; the subject, disembodied; and his subject-matter, unsexed. In the second essay, "Can the Native Return?" Beer turns the Victorian engagement with the idea of progress upside down, making a start out of 433</page><page sequence="2">434 Criticism, Vol. XXXIX, no. 3: Book Reviews the question begged by Clym Yeobright's actions in Hardy's Return of the Native (1878): Can the Native return? Relying on various accounts of what followed upon Captain Fitzroy's return of the native Fuegians Jemmy But ton, York Minster, and Fuegia Basket to their homeland, then turning to Sir John Franklin's last Arctic expedition (1846), Beer sees these texts, along with the researches of Dorset poet and linguist William Barnes, as both under writing the question and overdetermining its answer. "In Hardy's imagina tion, as in that of other Victorian writers, return is not possible without the idea of retrogression" (53). In the third and fourth essays, "Travelling the Other Way: Travel Narra tives and Truth Claims," and "Speaking for the Others: Relativism and Au thority in Victorian Anthropological Writing," Beer concerns herself with the way that the cultural practices typified by the travel narrative and anthropol ogical writing in the first half of the nineteenth century had two simulta neous and related effects: remarking the otherness of the object of the discourse, while at the same time marginalizing that object by deploying that otherness against the cultural backdrop of the British upper classes. Since the third essay focuses principally on the 1830s, it does not address what happened in the second half of the century; however, the fourth essay argues that in the second half of the century, writers as diverse as Henry Mayhew, writing in London Labour and the London Poor, and Robert Brown ing, writing in "Caliban upon Setebos," attempted to interrupt "that equable, overbearing conversation among peers," and "to listen to other voices, be neath and beyond those of the dominant interpreters. . ." (81). Beer's fifth essay, "Darwin and the Growth of Language Theory," revisits the significance of Darwin's early reading—and, above all, of his Origin of Species—in the debate between the essentialists and the developmentalists regarding how language originates and changes through time. A student of language theory—by the 1830s he had already read Locke, Dugald Stewart, Monboddo, Home Tooke, Brougham, and Hensleigh Wedgwood, among others—Darwin "uses linguistic theory . . . not only as a metaphor but also as an example, an 'illustration' of evolutionary processes" (102). Language is, in other words, among those species-specific but evolved behaviors that we inherit. But as a natural historian with field experience, Darwin knew that while a theory might be complete, the evidence attesting it could at best be only incomplete, owing to the fact that the very natural processes of which one speaks have worked unremittingly to efface some of that evidence. Ac cordingly, Darwin transposes natural theology's "old idea of 'the book of na ture' into a new historical register, emphasizing the book as 'a history of the world,' a history whose script and language itself changes over time, and, furthermore, he describes it as a document which is itself a physically dam aged product of historical change, now tattered and incomplete, with pages and whole chapters missing" (109). Although linguistics and evolutionary theory parted discursive ways toward the end of the nineteenth century, the rise of interest in animal communication—above all, the engagement with the question of whether animals either have language or can be made to have it under certain circumstances—has brought the two fields together again in the context of the debate over whether language is a unique attri bute of humanity resulting from its unique creation, or whether language is</page><page sequence="3">Criticism, Vol. XXXIX, no. 3: Book Reviews 435 an evolved form of communication already evident in the hominids who precede humanity in the evolutionary chain. In her sixth chapter, "Forging the Missing Link," Beer analyzes Victorian cultural coding, exploring "some of the ways in which the idea of 'the miss ing link' functioned . . . not only in the manifest context of palaentology and evolutionary theory but in the implications it bore for race and class, and sometimes gender" (119). Looking at cultural sources as diverse as Dar winian evolutionary theory, P. T. Barnum's fabricated remains of a mermaid, cartoons culled from Punch, and Browning's poetry, Beer concludes that "The fear disguised" in the fascination with the possibility that such a crea ture existed "was not, in the end, of otherness but of sameness: the 'other of social class, or racial theory, or primate life, might prove to be indistin guishable from those who set out to describe it" (145). The next three essays, gathered under the rubric "Description and Allu sion in Scientific Writing," focus rather more closely than the previous six do on the actual literary techniques of written Victorian scientific discourse. The seventh chapter, "Problems of Description in the Language of Discov ery," ranges widely, from Wordsworth's 1802 "Preface" to the Second Edi tion of Lyrical Ballads to Pynchon's The Crying of Lot 49 (1967), with intermediate landing places in texts such as Claude Bernard's Introduction a Vetude de la medecine experimentale; James Clerk Maxwell's "Molecules" (1873); Ernst Mach's The Analysis of Sensations and the Relation of the Physical to the Psychical (1914); Leonard Bloomfield's Linguistic Aspects of Science (1939); and Steven Rose, Leon Kamin, and R. C. Lewontin's Not in Our Genes (1984). Beer astutely sees the conventions of scientific writing as bespeaking "tacit agree ments with a projected readership that literature evades," to the end "that the shifting of linguistic levels has notably different functions in literary and scientific communication" (149-50). To put the case in terms that Beer might have used but did not, the control of linguistic levels in scientific writing serves to marginalize the amateur, the figure who Michel Serres, writing in Hermes (1984) views as the personifica tion of noise, in the information-theory sense of that term. But with the ama teur excluded, "scientific writers move across levels of language and reference," to the end that "the apparent autonomy and neutrality of de scription are shaken" (160). The move that dare not speak its name is none other than metabasis, or the category mistake, as discussed by Amos Fun kenstein, writing in Theology and the Scientific Imagination from the Middle Ages to the Seventeenth Century (1986). It is only by means of metabasis, Funken stein argues, that Galileo, Descartes, Newton, et al. are able to render nature accessible in reading her book. Autonomy and neutrality are not the goals of the poet or novelist, however, and what is feared by the scientist as meta basis is welcomed by the imaginative writer as metalepsis. When Pynchon's Nefastis, speaking of Maxwell's Demon among other things, tells Oedipa Maas that "Entropy is a figure of speech ... a metaphor," connecting "the world of thermodynamics to the world of information now" (qtd., 167), he does not have it quite right. Entropy in this context is a metaphor for meta phor—metalepsis, in other words. In the final analysis, the distinction re-en acts the struggle between the lumpers (poets and novelists) and the splitters (scientists). In Beer's more elegant formulation, "Distrust of the simultaneity</page><page sequence="4">436 Criticism, Vol. XXXIX, no. 3: Book Reviews of reading levels distinguishes scientific discourse from other forms of crea tive writing" (170). Such distrust duly noted, however, scientists and other creative writers face the same threat of language reifying the categories of the known that Shelley noted in A Defence of Poetry. To give Beer the last word here: "The utmost resourcefulness and probity of language are needed, both by scientists and poets, to outwit the tendency of description to stabi lize a foreknown world and curtail discovery." Yet "scientists need to have recourse to . . . the instability of reference, with which literary language rec ognizes multiple simultaneous levels of event and meaning" (172). "Translation or Transformation?: The Relations of Literature and Science," the eighth chapter, anticipates Gross and Levitt's Higher Superstition (1994) by nearly five years. Beer's thoroughgoing acquaintance with the literary scientific relations of the Victorian era leads her quickly to grasp the fact that one comes to science, especially if he is a mid-nineteenth-century male, with the cultural endowments of the "mother-tongue," consisting of the glorious moments of written English of all genres, and of the "father-tongue" (175), consisting of the glorious moments of the written classical languages. These texts in common, far from endowing Victorian thinkers of the upper classes with a common ontology, because of the ways in which they were taken up, actually left those thinkers with ontological commitments in conflict. Science, especially "big science" at it grew throughout the nineteenth century and beyond, strove to marginalize the ontological component of the narrative. Its "workers strove to contain their procedures within a single epistemological frame," thus denying the "variety of conflicted epistemologies" (176) that each individual ontological narrative gives rise to. So it seemed that in 1989, the time at which Beer put forward her position, it had at least the partial re sult of constraining scientists to accept "the risks of uncontrolled reception," underwritten by "an international system of intertextuality" (195). But not for long: "The questioning of meaning in (and across) science and literature," while the activity never sought the "reconciliation" (196) that Beer cautions against, did eventuate an angry backlash against science studies by self-pro claimed concerned scientists. Beer s ninth chapter, "Parable, Professionalization, and Literary Allusion in Victorian Scientific Writing," looks at the genre in question as being rather more conclusively shaped by assumptions about the class of the writer and the class of his (emphatically, his) audience, and by the need for such dis course to function as a social gatekeeper of sorts, than by the subject matter of the discourse per se. "The language available alike to nineteenth-century creative writers and scientists," Beer's "mother-tongue," "had been forged out of past literature, the Bible, philosophy, natural theology" (206). Far from being free-standing or heterogeneous discourses, all of these shared a word hoard and common social assumptions alike, and these in their turn led to what E. P. Thompson has called "key-words" which, like their metaphoric original, keystones, operate strategically in shaping and sustaining a given social fabric. Tracking the threat of metabasis (and inherent threat of subver sion) that these words pose across time and context, Beer observes, "Key words . . . began to flee across categories: 'tissue,' as body, clothing, argument; property, as possession and characteristics; fact, as stable observa tion and act accomplished" (207). In the hands of a scientist such as Max</page><page sequence="5">Criticism, Vol. XXXIX, no. 3: Book Reviews 437 well, who mobilizes the "mother-tongue" and the "father-tongue" with equal aplomb, not to mention Milton, the most famous progeny of these par ents, the richness verges on the chaotic. Chaos theory is not far to seek. The parable and allusion of the title "not only worked as tactic and resource in Victorian scientific writing. They could also harbour anxieties and insights that tapped the further implications of current scientific theories, beyond the range for which experiment could vouch" (215). The next four essays, gathered under the rubric "Victorian Physics and Fu tures," survey the social and intellectual reception of mid- and late-nine teenth-century physical theory. "'The Death of the Sun': Victorian Solar Physics and Solar Myth," Beer's tenth chapter, shows how a mistaken appli cation of the Second Law of Thermodynamics caused a rift between physi cists, on the one hand, and geologists and Darwinians, on the other. The mistake lay not with the assumption that the heat emanating from the sun tends toward that condition of uniform distribution known as entropy, but in the assumption, championed by William Thomson (subsequently Lord Kelvin) that the sun's heat resulted from combustion or some other chemical process then already observable under laboratory conditions. According to Thomson's calculations, given "the rate of dissipation of energy from the sun's source . . . there could not have been sufficient time for Darwinian evo lutionary processes to have taken place" (221), nor could there have been time for the uniformitarian development of the earth's geology championed by Lyell. Moreover, there was not much time left, according to Thomson. The prospects underwritten by Thomson's position were grim indeed. Beer cites a frightening dream recounted in Frances Powers Cobbe's Darwinism in Morals (1872), having to do with the disappearance of the sun. No less fright ening is Richard Proctor's chapter on "Suns in Flames" in Myths and Marvels of Astronomy (1878). During this period, Max Miiller, in his Lectures on the Or igin and Growth of Religion (1878), situated the sun as the centering object to which mythic systems and the religions that valorize them are all responses, thereby heightening the collective sense of how much was at stake in this discussion. Beer notes correctly that the "half-formulated anxieties" about the sun's impending extinction "worked ... to generate much imaginative thought and production" (225), a point also made in 1989, the year in which Beer's chapter first appeared, by Peter Allan Dale in his In Pursuit of a Scien tific Culture. Beer and Dale overlap, in fact, in their discussions of Hardy and George Eliot. What distinguishes Beer's treatment of this moment of crisis in Victorian culture is her concluding focus on some of the recuperative strate gies mobilized by the principals in this discussion, Darwin among them. His The Formation of Vegetable Mould, Through the Action of Worms, with Observa tions on Their Habits (1881) presents the common earthworm as the symbol of the "[C]ontinuity [that] persists through change. Out of reach of the sun, whose energy is running down, the worm survives, blind and damp, per fectly at home within its limited environment, surviving amid more and more complex forms—and also surviving after them. Worms are the meek of the earth" (238). The eleventh chapter, "Helmholtz, Tyndall, Gerard Manley Hopkins: The Prepared Imagination," is an attempt, following the line of argument em barked upon by Tom Zaniello in Hopkins in the Age of Darwin (1988), to</page><page sequence="6">438 Criticism, Vol. XXXIX, no. 3: Book Reviews sketch out the oppositions that such an imagination must mediate. While Zaniello's focus is primarily on natural history and geology, Beer's, as the other two principals named in her title suggests, is physics, as that science contributes to "the force of scientific discovery and speculation within Hop kins's poetry, both in its sense and sound" (243). Hopkins, as Beer notes, "was increasingly fascinated by scientific issues . . . under discussion in the field of physics" (245). But as an ordained Roman Catholic priest and a member of the Jesuit order, Hopkins was a case-in-point of the uneasy status of "sense-experience[, which] seeks an intelligible form in science, a sacral ized in religion: the two patterns for the Victorians sometimes cohere, some times lurch apart" (244). Cohere or lurch apart as they might, the primary sources for the scientific half of "the two patterns" were Hermann Helmholtz and his disciple and popularizer, John Tyndall. Beer identifies Helmholtz's texts on physiological acoustics, such as On the Sensation of Tone as a Physiological Basis for the Theory of Music (1863; tr. 1877), and on physiological optics, such as the three-vol ume Physiological Optics (1856-67), as particularly influential. "By the 1870's," according to Beer, "Helmholtz is, with Darwin, the recurrent point of refer ence for writers in Nature and Mind, where the weight of his presence is felt within many diverse arguments" (247). Nor was that influence restricted to scientific journals only. Helmholtz's researches were as likely to be discussed in The Fortnightly Review as Nature or Mind. The significance of Helmholtz, as well as of his friend Tyndall, lay in the impact of his physiologically based theories on the validity of arguments from design resting on the covert as sumption of an anthropomorphic creator-God. The challenge to belief was much as it had been in the Rome of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, the age of Bruno and Galileo. Indeed, in his Belfast Address, Tyn dall made pointed reference to Bruno as someone who, early on, concluded "that Nature in her productions does not imitate the technic of man" (qtd., 259). In the face of Tyndall's materialism and the physiological researches of Helmholtz on which it rested, Hopkins, along with other poets such as Wil liam Barnes, and scientists such as James Clerk Maxwell, undertook an ar chaeology of language. Hopkins's purpose in studying the history and philology of English was to recuperate the religious dimension of everyday lived experience that the language, by reason of its development and its use by expositors such as Tyndall, tends to resist, even though, as Beer notes, "his views temptingly ran alongside the religious, even while they repu diated religious authority" (260). That Hopkins's was ultimately a losing lin guistic as well as theological "search for an expression that can keep control and encompass the unravelling of the world in his own life, in the universe" (271) is made pointedly by Beer's observation that Hopkins's letters to Na ture all concern the sunset (271)—and, by implication, the dark night of the soul to follow. But in the sense that he did not go gentle but instead raged against the dying of the light, Hopkins was perhaps even more the modern poet than the circumstance of a belatedly posthumous first volume appear ing in 1918 has led us to believe. The Reader's Wager: Lots, Sorts, and Futures/' Beer's twelfth chapter, makes a start out of considering Peter Carey's Oscar and Lucinda (1988) and</page><page sequence="7">Criticism, Vol. XXXIX, no. 3: Book Reviews 439 ranges widely through English and American fiction—from Charles Dick ens's The Old Curiosity Shop (1841) to Julian Barnes's A History of the World in Ten and a Half Chapters (1989)—to explore both the thematization of gam bling in late-nineteenth-century British fiction and the way that this fiction draws the reader in, making her/him an interpretive gambler in the bar gain. Particularly acute is Beer's observation, corroborated by Ian Stewart's observations in Does God Play Dice?: The Mathematics of Chaos (1989), that even the most comprehensive explanation of observed phenomena—evolu tionary theory or thermodynamics, for example—is far from acting as a de terministic engine, and may in fact give rise to "unforseeable (and yet predicted) conclusion^]. . (277). The inability to predict the future, when combined with the gradual but marked recession of a superintendent theodicy, made gambling into one of those symbolic behaviors by means of which the late-nineteenth-century sub ject played at being at ease in the world by controlling its outcomes. Beer usefully compares the hazarding of wagers in gaming with the hazarding by an infant of the familiar object in Freud's "fort-da" game (284). Ultimately, Beer reaches an unforseeable and yet predictable conclusion of her own in a discussion of Stefan Zweig's "Twenty-Four Hours in a Woman's Life," which appeared in Stories and Legends (1927), and Hardy's The Return of the Native. If, as Beer says in discussing the latter, gambling gratifies an "antique yearning . . . the longing for disaster, the full but fictive experience of obliter ation" (294), then there is a third term to consider in analyzing the tensions and interplay between eros and thanatos, one that at once mediates and pre cipitates both of these: Spieltrieb. "Wave Theory and the Rise of Literary Modernism," the thirteenth chap ter, looks at the fate of literary realism in the framework of "a single exam ple, that of James Clerk Maxwell," in order "to illustrate . . . the restiveness about representation in the later nineteenth century—a restiveness shared, and crossing to and fro, between physicists, philosophers, and poets" (296 97). The issue lay not so much with the wave model itself. As Beer notes, the educated read Heraclitus, Lucretius, and Ovid, and were accordingly famil iar with the analysis that postulates all of what the subject perceives as the result of matter in wavelike flux or motion. Moreover, these same readers were aware that the absence of motion, whether resulting from the entropic equilibration of heat or the death of the sun, portended the death of the sub ject as well. The problem, rather, arose from the growing awareness on the part of Maxwell and others that there exists "a distinction between our knowledge of the world and the possible nature of the world. . (308). To intervene with a model of any sort, including the wave model, is to impose human knowledge on that nature. Accordingly, Maxwell avoided merging his mode of explanation with the topic studied, but he was highly conscious of the "changing functions of metaphor as they extend across scientific fields, shifting from technical description toward generalization that allows produc tive switching to take place between two fields" (309). Where Maxwell acted with extreme restraint so as not to reify the world, his correspondent and contemporary John Tyndall mobilized a rhetoric the tendency of which "was not dissolution but making visible" (312), particu larly in his work on radiation in general and the " 'dark rays'" of the sun in</page><page sequence="8">440 Criticism, Vol. XXXIX, no. 3: Book Reviews particular. Tyndall's work in "conveying to a general readership information about current scientific work and illuminating its penumbra of meaning" (311) exerted a particular if long-range influence on Virginia Woolf's The Waves (1931). Ultimately, the rise of quantum mechanics out of the short comings of the wave theory taken by itself proved to foster a rebirth of real ism, but a realism no longer in expressive command of the external world it purports to survey. In Beer's fine conclusion, realism "has come to depend on paradox and on the logic of zeugma" (315). Beer's fourteenth chapter and coda, "Square Rounds and Other Awkward Fits: Chemistry as Theatre," looks at Tony Harrison's Square Rounds (1992), a "theatre-piece (he does not call it a play)" (323) that focuses on the life of the German-Jewish chemist Fritz Haber. Haber, who received the 1918 Nobel Prize in chemistry for his work on the synthesis of ammonia, was viewed by the Allies as a war criminal for his work in developing the poison gas that felled innumerable Allied troops and proved to be the ancestor of Xyklon-B, the lethal gas of the German concentration camps. Haber's life is read in re lief against other lives, such as that of James Puckle, who invented the gun bearing his name that fired square rounds and round rounds interchange ably, ostensibly so that one could fire the more painful square ammunition at Moslems, while showing mercy to fellow-Christians by using round bul lets (324). Then there are "the Hiram brothers, makers of both the maximite gun for TNT and of the anti-asthma glass pipe" (325). With apologies to Beer, Harrison's title and the piece that goes by that ti tle, above and beyond recuperating the notion of humanity-as-paradox, dem onstrate a good deal more than "the vacillations between good and evil outcomes in the world from apparently neutral experiment in the labora tory" (323). Beer correctly traces the problem that Harrison engages back to the alchemical origins of chemistry, but she fails to note that there are prior "vacillations" that are moral rather than chemical in nature. One of the rea sons that alchemists such as Michael Maier, writing in Atalanta Fugiens (1623), advises the would-be alchemist to emulate the procedures of the housewife going about her daily tasks (322) is that those procedures serve to conceal the alchemical project of transforming dross to gold. Such a transfor mation, not to mention the myriad of other transformations that underwrite it, is the handiwork of someone playing God. And playing God is precisely what the likes of Puckle and Haber did, the former in deciding that Christianity is the true faith while Islam is an abomi nation meriting a painful death, the latter in deciding that poison gas would shorten the war and cause the Germans, whose standard-issue military belt buckle bore the inscription "Gott mit uns," to triumph. The alchemical model in fact comes full circle with Haber, who proposed extracting gold from seawater as a means of funding German reparations. In the end, Harrison's audience should take away from Square Rounds an awareness that "There is no secure divide between the domestic world and the laboratory. Both look like private spaces; both produce and are involved in communal consequences, world-wide transformations" (331). Unless transformed to the "open fields" of Beer's title and interrogated by those who are able to frame questions for the values that underwrite them, both</page><page sequence="9">Criticism, Vol. XXXIX, no. 3: Book Reviews 441 the domestic world and the laboratory will continue to be sites of power re lations and oppression for those unable to frame the questions. My issues with the concluding chapter duly noted, I wish to note the fluid ease with which Beer mobilizes her nineteenth- and twentieth-century texts in the service of her arguments. Her writing itself is both graceful and eco nomical. If I have any reservation about the present volume, it has to do with Beer's theoretical isolation. She does not engage the likes of George Levine, N. Katherine Hayles, or Michel Serres in critical debate, choosing in stead to focus on historically or sociologically oriented science studies, and a relatively narrow band of these. On the one hand, it speaks well of Beer's sense of her own accomplishment that she does not feel the need to do so; on the other, one has a sense that something particularly rich has been lost by this failure to engage. But that loss looms small in relation to the value re ceived by the reader of Open Fields. Northeastern University Stuart Peterfreund</page></plain_text>
