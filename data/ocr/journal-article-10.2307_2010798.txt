An impetus to the advancement of scientific method in animal psy- chology is presented in this work. By means of objective study, it en- deavors to substitute for vague words and anthropomorphic interpreta- tions, analytic description of animal activities. After an historical survey of the subject, in which the opposed tendencies of alithropomorphism and pure automatism are contrasted, the present status of existing problems is outlined. The author finds the most fruitful method for the analysis of psychic phenomena to be the "ethological," "the study of the relations of living beings among them- selves and with the diverse modalities of the exterior environment." In the discussioln of the different problems considered the author has gath- ered together the various isolated contributions to the subject and thereby rendered an important service to modern comparative psychology. A review of the various criteria advanced for the determination of "psychism " in animal activities shows them to be generally unsatisfac- tory. The morphological tests do not agree and the functional determina- tions likewise prove inadequate. To say there is psychic activity when an animal learns, chooses, etc., tends to a discussion of words rather than to the discovery of facts. By giving a purely objective definition of "psy- chism " -viz., the association of sensations-the question as to the possi- bility of a comparative psychology is removed. Mlere variability of reactions does not suffice as a criterion of psychism. It is the analysis of the variability of reactions, the discovery if the origin of these is organic, peripheral, or central, which furnishes the means for the objective determination of psychism. It must be remarked that in this problem of psychism there is no question as to the subject of consciousness, but rather a purely biological interpretation of the mechanism of reactions.</page><page sequence="2">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 585 And now the way is prepared for the discussion of facts. Book III., which contains perhaps the most important contribution of the work, passes to the consideration of the "Dynamics of Psychic Phenomena." The author combats the anthropomorphic interpretations of the activities of the inferior animals, and seeks to discover the laws which regulate these phenomena. Observation and experiment lead to the conclusion that certain biological notions are generally adequate for the explanation of the movements of the inferior animals (infusoria, polypes, worms), and there is no requirement for a psychological interpretation, such as will, choice, etc. The notion of tropism is of fundamental importance in the mechanism of reactions. By tropism is understood those irresistible movements of the animal made in response to forces of the exterior environment. Many misunderstandings of this notion are due to the failure to recognize the influence of the law of symmetry in excitations, which causes the oscillatory movements in the phenomena of tropisms. A second essential characteristic of animal activities is that of " differential sensibility " (a conception employed for the first time in a work on com- parative psychology). Responses are modified by variations in the acting force. If Jennings had recognized these manifestations of differential sensibility, his theory of " trials and errors " would have been superfluous. The activities, which Jennings attributes to the result of trials and errors, are shown to be due to the superposition of differential sensibility upon tropisms. Again the manifestations of vital rhythms (an original chap- ter of the book) must be considered in the mechanism of animal activ- ities. Certain periodic activities of animals are the result of chemical changes induced by regular variations in the environment. This purely biological phenomenon has no need of such psychic explanation as pre- vision of the future on the part of the animal. It is important to distinguish between reactions which are the result of a combination of motive impulsions and those which respond to an association of sensations (selnsation in the physiological sense). In the former case the movements are automatic and obey the laws of mechanics and physics. In the second instance the reactions do " not obey directly the force of the exterior environment, but rather special states of the system of coordination (the lnervous system) provoked by the complexes of external excitants. Here we have an association of sensations, " psy- chism." Among the inferior animals (polypes, worms, mollusks) there is no evidence of any predominating psychic activity. Tropisms, differ- ential sensibility, and their combination, are the determining character- istics. Psychism among these animals is " rudimentary." Proceeding to the discussion of the reactions of the more highly organized animals (articulates, vertebrates), we are confrolnted with the phenomena of the "Acquisition of IIabits " (Book IV.), phenomena which involve the association of sensatiolns or psychism. The role of vision is fundamental in effecting this psychic revolution. The author combats the mechanistic interpretation which would make vision an example of tropism. In tropism a single reaction is possible, while in</page><page sequence="3">586 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY vision there is forcibly a choice. Experimental researches on the acqui- sition of habits have given rise to two opposed attitudes of interpretation; the mechanistic, which sees in these phenomena only the result of a com- bination of tropisms; and, on the other hand, these manifestations are explained as results of association of sensations. The tendency to explain everything by tropisms is deplored. In such phenomena as " the return to the nest," "the recognition of objects," "the relations of inisects and flowers," there is evidence of association of sensations. The confusion of tropism and associative memory may be partly explained by the fact that in associative phenomena one element is more predominant than others in exciting activity. In the discussion of finality in animal psychology it is maintained that adaptation to an end is no reason for qualifying an act as psychic. Thus the search for nourishment may often be explained by tropisms and differential sensibility, acts purely mechanical. Again, what are generally denoted as reflex movements can not be termed psychic, since they are not of central origin. If the fact that an act is adapted to an end es- tablished its psychic character, all nature would be psychic. A review of the classic conceptions of instinct shows little accord as to the significance of this termn. The word has been used to cover phe- nomena as diverse as tropisms, differential sensibility, and associative memory. The word is simply a word, of little service in scientific investi- gation. The conservation of this term has led to the opposition of in- stinct and intelligence, which notions may be more profitably compre- hended as two stages of the same process. The book concludes with a sketch of the probable evolution of psy- chism. This development has been generally accomplished by " psychic revolutions." We encounter the first psychic revolution in the perfecting of the receptive organs (primarily the eye). The second great develop- ment appears with the vertebrates in the formation of a registering appa- ratus, the brain. Here for the first time it is correct to speak of intel- ligence. The author denies intelligence among the articulates, and finds there " only a favorable soil for the birth of intelligence." The third psychic revolution takes place with the advent of man.
