<plain_text><page sequence="1">Natural Powers and Powerful Natures R. Harre and E. H. Madden The justification of a wholly non-Humean conceptual scheme, based upon the idea of enduring individuals with powers, rests in part on the success of such a scheme in resolving the problems bequeathed to us by the Humean tradition and in part must be achieved by a careful construction of the metaphysics of the new scheme itself. By this we mean a thorough exposition of the meaning and interrelations of the concepts of the new scheme. It is to the latter task that we turn in this paper, being satisfied that the power of the scheme to give a rational account of science has been shown,1 and that its effectiveness in resolving the Humean problems and dilemmas has been amply demonstrated.2 We are concerned with four main galaxies of problems in this paper. The first concerns the securing of a basis for assumptions about continuity and the rational accounting for change. Such a basis is required to put arguments which depend upon the concept of a nature on a sound footing. In these arguments, we believe, are to be found the most serious direct confrontations with the Ilumean way of looking at causality and science. The investigation of the concept of the nature of a thing or material leads us into a position from which we can usefully revive the notion of a natural kind. The development of a practical modern conception of natural kind, and the complementary examination of the fundamental assumptions of the rival event-ontology occupies the second section. The third group of problems surrounds the important notion of agency, and we shall develop that concept in a manner wholly independent both of anthropomorphic considerations and of the concept of spontaneity, with which it is sometimes misleadingly identified both in the lay and professional mind. Finally we undertake a further exposition of the nature of the concept of a power, particularly as it is exemplified in the physicist's conception of the field of potential. Natures and the Limits of Individuality One of the most powerful arguments against the Humean's tendency to base his theory on the assumption that what is not logically necessary is 1 R. Harre, The Principles of Scientific Thinking (London: Macmillan and Chicago: University of Chicago Press, I970). 2 E. H. Madden and P. Hare, 'The Powers That Be', Dialogue, 10 (I971), 12-3 1 . Philosophy 48 I973 209</page><page sequence="2">R. Harre and E. H. Madden absolutely contingent draws upon the distinction between changes in the way things behave for which a rational account can be given, and those for which such an account is impossible in principle. One of the basic assumptions of the Humean point of view is that in some well specified physical set-up anything whatever must be supposed to be possible. Thus if some sodium metal is put into water at room temperature our confidence that it will busily evolve hydrogen is supposed to be undermined by the thought that it might produce the Requiem Mass instead, or indeed anything whatever. Thus the description of the set-up, call it S, is supposed never to be contradicted by any other description whatever purporting to describe an outcome of S. We have argued elsewhere that the occurrence within S of descriptions of the natures of the things and substances involved provides an adequate response to the argument,3 since only by supposing a change in the nature of either sodium or water or both could it be argued that the conjunction of S and the statement of a formal contradictory of its usual outcome was not inconsistent. Underlying this argument is the principle that it is possible to give a rational account of the changes that do occur in the causal powers of things and materials by reference to changes in their natures. A Humean must repudiate this principle as being of only limited application, since the strength of his argument depends upon the assumption that there are cases in which changes in the causal powers of things and materials defy rational explanation, and that such cases can be taken as paradigms of situations to which we would wish to apply the concept of causality. To establish the central position and unchallengeable status of our counter-Humean principle we must examine and justify certain very important assumptions about the criteria for continuity and self-identity of those ordinary and typical individuals and substances for changes in whose causal powers our principle provides the basis of rational explanation. The first step then must be roughly to characterize the cases which we take to be paradigmatic and to contrast these with a similar characterization of the H-umean's central examples. We offer as a paradigm of explicable change the case of a substance which slowly loses certain of its causal powers while maintaining a recog- nizable set of other properties, sufficient to establish inductively that it is indeed in some sense the same stuff. For instance yeast may lose its power to produce fermentation, nitroglycerine its power to explode, duralumin its power to resist certain shearing forces and so on. Such cases cannot be offered in support of the Humean contention, since a rational account of these changes is possible in terms of the changing natures of the substances involved. Such an account is possible because in such cases there is an 3E. H. Madden, 'Hume and the Fiery Furnace', Philosophy of Science, 38 (1971), 6a-78. 2IO</page><page sequence="3">Natural Powers and Powerful Natures unproblematic material basis for the identity of the substance through change. The very same atoms are preserved throughout the tragic history of the waning powers of a piece of dynamite, but they have been slowly rearranging themselves into a less action-packed organization. The yeast still consists of Io6 microscopic plants, but they are not what they used to be as voracious consumers of sugar, and heavy exhalers of carbon dioxide. These examples are illustrative of cases where there is a sufficient retention of properties for an empirically ascertainable self-identity to be maintained, but a sufficient change in internal organization and so on has occurred for it to be proper for us to say that the waning powers are explained by these changes, which are sufficiently profound and far-reaching in their effects upon the powers of the substance to be elevated to the status of a change in its nature. One should note that there is a measure of convention in what is separated off as a change in nature, as against a change in identity and in contrast to a merely superficial change. This is partly determined by which powers of the substance we are taking to be central. For instance if, as one of the authors experienced, the dynamite were being used to prop up one side of a table in a forest hut, then all that mattered for that purpose was the power of the pile of sticks to resist compression! The paradigm for cases of inexplicable change has to be sought in the fertile imagination of Humeans since it is nowhere observed in nature, a fact of some significance. The fountain pen that becomes a pig,4 the vase that becomes a woman5 and so on, are the kind of cases the Humean asks us to contemplate as he prepares his case against the rationality of science. These cases seem to us to have a common underlying rationale which explains their apparent power over the minds of otherwise rational men. They are, one and all, susceptible of two exegeses, and in the slide from the one to the other the mind is carried from the reasonable to the absurd. They can be looked upon as cases in which one thing changes into another, or they may be looked upon as cases in which one thing is suddenly and inexplicably replaced by another thing, at the same place and continuous with it in time. The first exegesis directs us towards the production of a rational account, by advertence to a continuously existing substance upon which change might be predicated, while the second exegesis takes away the possibility of providing such an account, since it renders the course of change atomistic. The choice of bizarre examples is just what produces the underlying and powerful ambiguity upon which the argument rests. By being bizarre they leave us no way to look for the basis of a rational account, since they invite the second, 'replacement', exegesis, while by 4 For a general discussion of this kind of case, see J. L. Austin, Sense and Sensibilia, Clarendon Press, Oxford, i962, Ch. X. 5 E. H. Madden, op. cit. 2II</page><page sequence="4">R. Harre and E. H. Madden being stated in 'change' language they seem to invite all that is involved in the ordinary explanation of change of properties and powers by change in natures. The vase that becomes a woman is either a case of the rearrange- ment of molecules (swords to ploughshares) in which case it does not support the Humean line, or it is a case of the replacement of one entity, which has been annihilated, by the creation of another, in which case it is a Humean event pair, but is, a fortiori, incapable of being given a rational account, and so its logic is irrelevant to the understanding of science, which is precisely the set of rational accounts of change. Our argument is not yet complete, since we have to deal with those intermediate cases which can be claimed by a Humean to be scientific and also to be exemplifications of his subtly ambiguous paradigm. We would like to bring forward two cases in ascending order of difficulty. Consider the evolution of a population from one species into another. At the end of the process there are no individuals living which made up the population when the process began. And yet we want to be able to say not that one species mysteriously replaced another in that territory or ecological niche, but that the one evolved into the other, a phrase clearly implying some measure of continuity and thus calling for a rational account in the manner of our first paradigm. Biologists preserve the non-Humean and rational paradigm by one of two moves, either of which meets our requirements for the metaphysical basis of a rational account. One move is to treat the population as an individual, and to predicate the species changes of it. This, one might say, is the more metaphysical and abstract move, since the population, in this sense, is not a material existent which persists through time, but rather an overlapping set of material existences, each related to the other by progenitive bonds. Nevertheless, whatever may be the existential status of the quasi-entity which persists, the logical structure of the move is identical with that of the yeast/dynamite paradigm. But biologists do not all favour this way out. Some prefer to consider the matter in terms of genes, and have developed the concept of the gene-pool as a quasi-material entity which persists through the changes of species, at least in part. When we look a little deeper into the metaphysics of that concept it begins to look like the notion of population. The physical basis of the genes changes generation by generation. Only the structure of their order is mapped from one generation on to the DNA of the next. This can be treated in a very abstract way, as information, and the evolution of species seen as a thermodynamic phenomenon. But whatever the details the logical structure is clear, and it is that of the first, non-Humean paradigm. The reason why this solution arises so naturally in the context of biology may be that biological organisms are very far from being ultimate entities, and their powers and capacities are held to be explicable in terms of their essential natures, which are described in terms of molecular and histo- 212</page><page sequence="5">Natural Powers and Powerful Natures logical organization. Similarly the powers of the atoms of chemical elements are accounted for in terms of their anatomy. But there do seem to be cases, and it is upon these that the more sophisticated neo-Humean is often found to rely, of the ultimate irrationality of nature and science. It is supposed that there are interactions so fundamental that they must be assimilated to his paradigm, to the case of the pen and the pig, the sodium and the Requiem Mass, the vase and the woman, that is to cases where it is impossible to provide a criterion which would distinguish the continuous change of one thing into another, from the replacement of one annihilated object by another newly created object. The annihilation of the one and the creation of the other would form a pair of Humean, atomistic events. When an electron meets a positron they mutually annihilate one another and a gamma ray is the sole progeny to bless their union. Here surely is a case in science, and a fundamental case at that, which can be assimilated to the pen and pig paradigm. Now no one would deny that there is no empirical ground for the introduction of a material basis for the change and so no empirical ground for the preservation of rationality, such as clearly exists in the paradigm of the yeast, and, with a degree of abstraction, even in the case of the population. But what scientists do in the case of the electron/proton/ gamma ray case is to maintain the paradigm of rational explanation by inventing a quasi-substance to be the bearer of continuity through change, and thus the basis of a rational and non-Humean account of that change. The natures of electrons, positrons and gamma rays are all three seen in terms of energy. Nothing has been annihilated or created in this micro- fracas but the energy involved has taken on, in sequence, a variety of its possible forms. The essential nature of matter and radiation is energy, so it is maintained, but the point of maintaining this is precisely to allow one to make use of a notion of the nature of things, according to which, given the energetic nature of electrons and positrons, the conjunction of specifications of their joint natures with a statement contradicting the description of the usual outcome of their union, namely the appearance of the gamma ray with its nature, would be a violation of natural necessity. An electron and a positron cannot turn into a pig, but then neither can a pen, and we all know that. This is not to say that the assertion that the outcome is necessary is derivative only from the internal logical necessity of the formula 'If p has nature N, and produces q on stimulus s, and s happens, then q must occur' where N is what enables p to produce q, since this would lead to the assimilation of this case to the causally empty formula 'If p materially implies q, and p, so q' whose internal order is equally logically necessary. For us the completion of a deductive structure is neither necessary nor sufficient for the ascription of a natural necessity to the process it describes. It is not necessary since wve may be sufficiently well satisfied with the 213</page><page sequence="6">R. Harre and E. H. Madden generative powers of the productive mechanism described in the antecedent of the causal statement even when we are ill informed about the conditions which bring it into action, and the deductive structure is certainly not sufficient, since it can be satisfied by all manner of feeble explanations provided the effect can be subsumed under some sort of generalization. Natural Kinds and the Defects of the Event-Ontology The above discussion of material continuity provides the basis for a theory of natural kinds, which, as we shall see, the event-ontology of the Humean is unable to provide. A class or species of anything is said to be arbitrary or conventional when the individuals composing it have only the characteristics in common which formed the basis of the classification, while a class is labelled real or fundamental when the individuals composing it have a cluster of characteristics in common. Thus the class of people whose last names begin with the letters A to W is a conventional or arbitrary one, while the class of mammals is a real or fundamental one. But having a cluster of characteristics in common is far from sufficient for forming a natural kind. What is needed in addition is an account of why the properties clustered are not independent of one another, that is of why they are not to be treated as just accidental combinations that just happened to occur. Our discussion about the nature of continuity and the rational basis of change provides the needed account. What really makes a collection a natural kind is that the members share a genetic, generative mechanism which, along with the nature of the environment, explains why a particular set of characters are had in common. Changes in the set of characters are explained by changes in the generative mechanisms which can be identified as the nature or part of the nature of the natural kind. In the biological kind this would be the genotype. This latter point is important, since, as we well know, the nominal essences of classes frequently change. In view of such changes, one is led to the view that classification is arbitrary unless one is able to invoke the concept of a change in the generative mechanism. The only other way to render classifications non-arbitrary is the hopeless, pre-Darwinian one of insisting that real classes consist of individuals that never change their nominal essences through time. Such a move is hopeless not only because there are few, if any, such classes, but also because such a view provides no insight whatever into the enormous amount of change that does occur among nominal essences. The Humean's event-ontology, by its very nature, is incapable of providing a rational account of natural kinds. Before we can show why this is so it is necessary to clarify the concept of event, and to see precisely what sense of this term is involved in talking about the event-ontology of the Humean. 214</page><page sequence="7">Natural Powers and Powerful Natures Intuitively the concept of an event is easy to grasp; what we ordinarily mean by it is a 'happening' or occurrence, as against a permanent or semi-permanent state of affairs or an enduring or semi-enduring thing. In our own ontology, a 'state-of-affairs' consists of structures of particulars that endure (of which physical objects would be one type), properties and powers of those particulars, and relations among them. The commonsense view of 'event', then, is captured in this ontology as 'change in a state of affairs'. An example of an event in this sense would be the striking of a tree by lightning, the collapsing of a barn, a trip to Spain, and the recalling of a forgotten name. Such an event occurs at some time and place but is not itself a dimensionless point in space and time. A change in a state of affairs rather occupies a span of time, and usually a region of space. On our view, 'event' is to be understood in terms of an ontology of enduring things, while on the Humean view enduring things are conceived to be constructions out of events. The Humean notion of event, however, is quite different from the ordinary one we have incorporated into our ontology. An event in the Humean sense can be understood best as a temporal cross-section of what we would ordinarily call a physical object. 'x is red at tW', 'x is round at t1', 'x is sweet at t1', etc. would each be an event in this sense. The only connexion this sense of 'event' has with the ordinary one is that all Humean events are momentary 'happenings' in consciousness, the immediate awareness of the moment. A physical object is conceived to be a construction out of such events; it is a collection of such events bound together by temporal continuity and identity, or con- tinuous change of place, and of course requires the assumption of both the density and continuity of time; neither of which is an empirical concept. For intervals of space and time to be dense it is merely required that there be infinitely many spatial or temporal 'points' in any interval, however short, and this requirement could be met by supposing them to be sequences of points of the order of the rational numbers, which can be associated with the idea of a set of points produced by indefinitely pro- longed division of the intervals. One could thus imagine density as a kind of attenuated empirical concept. But for a sequence of points to be con- tinuous it must meet Dedekind's condition, which, as Weierstrass showed, implies that the sequence is dense, but is not implied by the assumption of density. A continuous sequence is of the order of the real numbers, and this concept certainly cannot be regarded as an attenuated empirical concept. The assumption of continuity, unlike the assumption of density, is quite certainly a metaphysical theory about the nature of space and time, towards which the possibility of indefinitely prolonged processes of division is quite neutral. A physical object in the sense of the Humean ontology is a homogeneous grouping of point-events like 'being red', 'being round', 'being sweet' and the like, in a given spatial region, and a homogeneous grouping of these 2I5</page><page sequence="8">R. Harre and E. H. Madden same events through a givern interval of time. The result of both sorts of grouping in the present case supposedly produces the required apple. Such a 'physical object' can be said to persist or endure precisely because the events homogeneously hang together for a certain span of time. These objects can be said to change if the point-events at tz differ in a systematic way from the point-events at ta. It is crucial to note that in this sense of 'physical object' physical objects can be said to have temporal as well as spatial parts, and that these collections-of-events 'physical objects' may or may not have any physical counterparts, depending on whether or not the epistemic leap from experiences to their objects is allowed. If a leap from impressions to what they are impressions of is allowed, then there are physical counterparts to these events; and physical objects, in this case, turn out to be collections of such counterparts bound together by spatial and temporal contingencies, such as collocation and conduration. If no such leap is allowed, then a physical object is literally construed as a collection of impressions, themselves events bound together by contingent homogeneity in a fictitious space and a subjective time. That this event-ontology cannot yield a concept of natural kind can be seen from the following considerations: the Humean event is instantaneous, punctiform and elementary, and from this characterization follows its atomicity, its lack of internal connexions with anything else. The atomicity of events in turn ensures the sequential independence of properties. The redness of X at t, and t2 happen to occur in that sequence but do not belong in that sequence, since the event-ontology eliminates the notion of an enduring entity whose nature explains why that thing exhibits a given property continuously. It is this sequential independence of properties that leads to the Huumean problem of induction. If properties are inde- pendent, then indeed what reason is there for supposing that at t2 the 'apple' will be round instead of square? Moreover the atomicity of events not only ensures the sequential independence of events but their co-existing independence as well. Redness, roundness, and sweetness at t1 or t2 happen to go together but do not in any sense belong together, since the event-ontology, again, has eliminated the notion of an enduring entity whose nature explains why properties of the apple co-exist. Consequently, from the independence of co-existing properties it follows in principle for the Humean that there can be no natural kinds. In being over-nice about the merits of the concept of substance, whose introduction would provide the basis for an account of the co-existence and endurance of ensembles of properties, the Humean finds he has lost the vitally important concept of a thing as well. A similar puritanism about the concept of necessary connexion finds the Humean with no concept of connexion at all. The event-ontology not only has the unhappy consequence of denying natural kinds, precisely what the scientist is trying to discover, but it also gives rise to the riddle of inductive inference. When we add the problem 2i6</page><page sequence="9">Natural Powers and Powerful Natures of distinguishing accidental and nomic universals, the paradoxes of confirmation, the paradoxes of time-centred concepts, the event-ontology begins to take on the dimensions of a philosophical disaster. Rather than problems to be solved with the event-ontology, these consequences constitute a reductio of that ontology. One cannot suppress the question why it found favour at all. The only answer seems to be that some philoso- phers were forced into it by what they took to be irresistible epistemic considerations, coupled with a genuine wariness of the over-extension of the concept of material substance. Illusion and hallucination supposedly show that sometimes we are directly aware of our own sensations (or sense-data), while the mediating function of the sense organs and nerve tracks supposedly shows that we are directly aware only of such entities. From the first step an event-ontology of one of the two varieties is in- escapable. But the whole thrust of epistemic studies during the past twenty years goes against this approach. The interpretation of physical object sentences in terms of sentences about events (whether the events are construed phenomenalistically or as physical happenings) has been shown to be hopelessly inadequate in a very wide variety of contexts and by a wide range of arguments. Most significantly, the whole point of departure for this philosophical misadventure, namely that we are alleged to be aware only of sense-data, has been successfully eliminated by the central insight that phrases about sensing must be interpreted adverbially rather than substantivally. Contemporary epistemic realism-which is both the heir of the tradition called critical realism, and the upshot of the destructive arguments of critics such as J. L. Austin-is the handmaiden of the ontological realism that we are defending in this paper. Finally the powerful psychological work of J. J. Gibson has shown that there is no empirical basis for the tacit assumption, shared by many philosophers, that as a matter of fact percepts are organized groups of sensations. Since there is no foundation for the event-ontology, there is no compulsion to retain any of its consequences. The Restoration of the Concept of the Natural Agent The concept of agency in nature has fared poorly in recent discussions. The usual alternatives offered are the positivistic denial of agency in nature on the grounds of an over-extended fear of anthropomorphism, or the interpretation of the notion in terms of human agency. On our view of powerful particulars 'agency' is a concept applicable to the physical world, but the problem is to characterize it carefully enough so that it is clearly distinct though not wholly different from that of human agency. If this can be achieved yet another promising infant will be preserved from the fate that sometimes follows the careless disposal of its bath water. 2I7</page><page sequence="10">R. Harre and E. H. Madden The concepts of agency and power are closely associated, but to grasp this association we need first to distinguish 'power' from 'natural necessity'. Locke was at pains to distinguish these concepts, though he gave no analysis of the latter. Our job is to show that Locke is correct in keeping these concepts distinct by showing exactly how they are different. Then we shall be in a position to see how 'agency' is legitimately applied to nature in the concept of power. Since air has weight, the 'sea of air' around the Earth exerts pressure increasing with depth. The atmosphere, we say, has the power to raise water in a pump when air is evacuated from the shaft. We explain the power of the atmosphere to do this by referring to its nature, that it has weight and exerts pressure, being what it is, and the fact that there was no air in the shaft to counteract it. Call the atmosphere p, its nature N, the releasing occasion of pumping air from the shaft x, and the result that water goes up the shaft y. As we have argued in detail elsewhere,6 the relationship between N of p and x, on the one hand, and y on the other, is a necessary one. If N of p plus x explains the occurrence of y, then to say that y did not occur after x, though p continued to exhibit N all the while, is inconsistent, saying at once that the nature of the atmosphere and the evacuation of the air does and does not explain the rising of the water in the pipe. This concept of natural necessity is distinct, though closely tied to that of power. It should be noticed first that our mention of 'the power of the air' is made in the claim about natural necessity. 'N of p plus x produces y' replaces the 'power of p to do y.'7 The former, so to speak, redeems the promise of explanation offered by the latter. But power statements are, in many cases, more than promissory notes. They refer to genuine agencies which are explained but not eliminated by adverting to the general 'natures of things' form of explanation. They refer to the agency of a physical particular in the sense of its ability to make something happen, i.e. its potency. It is the pressure of the atmosphere that makes the water rise in the pump when air is evacuated from the shaft, just as it is the pressure of the sea that crushes the submarine when it submerges too deeply. And this ability to make something happen is possessed in either a strong or a weak sense. The atmosphere is exerting pressure all the time, and so always exhibits the power that will have a certain result under specifiable conditions. Given its nature, a stick of dynamite also has the power to explode, though it does not manifest this power until the proper conditions obtain. Thus there is something latent in those entities in nature which have power and are agents, but are not continuously manifesting their powers. 6 E. H. Madden, op. cit. 7 R. Harr', 'Powers', British Journal for the Philosophy of Science, 21 (I970), 8i-ioi. 2i8</page><page sequence="11">Natural Powers and Powerful Natures The concept of agency applied to nature, as we have so far explained it, is similar to agency in human affairs. To say that John is an agent is to say that he is able to make something happen and that he is able to do so even when he is not at the moment making it happen. John is an agent when he moves the stone, and he is able, his muscles being what they are, to move the stone even when at the moment he is not moving it. The crucial difference between physical and human agency is that a physical entity does not usually initiate its own activity while a human being can and often does. Put in our terminology the occasion x for exhibiting the power y can be initiated by p himself in the case of human beings, but unless the conditions are specially circumscribed, not by physical objects in general. In this way the concept of 'spontaneity' can be distinguished from 'agency'. It has sometimes been assumed8 that an essential feature of the concept of human agency is that the causal sequence which ends in the desired outcome, if read 'backwards', so to speak, terminates in the human agent. A spontaneous happening has no causal antecedents. The paradigm of a natural agent, in accordance with this idea, would be the atom of radio-active material whose disintegration cannot be accounted for causally, and by a slight stretch of the concept, the unpredictable element in the outcome of an interaction at that level of nature where quantum rules reign. The concept of the natural agent that we are promoting is more general than this, in that the manifestations of the natures of things are usually to be explained by the occurrence of some stimulus, yet by invoking the concept of latency we can accommodate the cases in which the internal building up of some power-endowing substance (like water behind the dam), or quasi-substance (like kinetic energy in the electrons of the Bohr atom) reaches a point at which the 'barriers' containing it can no longer hold, and it discharges 'spontaneously', i.e. without stimulating cause. It is instructive to see what Locke has to say on this point. He classifies powers in a twofold fashion: 'as able to make or able to receive any change'. The one he calls 'active power', the other 'passive power'. Physical objects, he thinks, never exhibit active powers; they have no agency whatever. The first billiard ball smacking into the second imparts motion to it. The second ball is clearly a passive thing in this case, but the first one too, according to Locke, has only passive power, because its motion was not self-initiated, but brought into being from outside. Locke, however, conflates here 'the power to initiate x' with a strong sense of agency that only sentient beings can have-a conflation which would not be serious if it did not suggest that the former concept was insufficient for any sense of agency. The concept of energy was introduced into physics precisely 8A. M. Munn, Free Will and Determinism (London: MacGibbon and Kee, 1960). 219</page><page sequence="12">R. Harre and E. H. Madden to make possible the application of the latency/potency paradigm to such cases, since the moving ball is clearly an agent of change. Locke's account is instructively pre-dynamic. Hence the first billiard ball can be treated as a genuinely active or powerful thing by virtue of its motion, however the motion was acquired. It is a thing that makes things happen, even though what makes it make things happen was not self-initiated. When we add the latter concept, the agency becomes sentient in form, and of course does not apply to physical things. Contrasted with the active, powerful things and materials of nature are those which are passive and inert in nature, those to which things happen by virtue of the agency of the things which are active. We have already noticed that the rationale of this way of seeing interaction, and of the attribution of the power to the moving ball, is achieved by endowing the ball with a store of energy, proportional to the second power of its velocity, and in this way the various attributions of agency and passivity are made to fit the latency/potency paradigm. Many qualifications would have to be introduced to make the notions of power, agency and the contrast between active and passive entities com- pletely clear, but the following may be helpful in the pursuit of this goal. i. The distinction between active and passive entities marks out no absolute distinction among things and substances. Each thing, no doubt, has both powers and liabilities, nothing in nature being wholly active and nothing wholly inert. Something which is acted upon on one occasion may act upon another thing in different circumstances. A landslide may crush a tractor that crushed a rotting bridge. Indeed there is frequently some reciprocal action in the interaction of active and passive things. The chain saw cuts the tree and the tree dulls the teeth of the saw. 2. The power or agency of something to bring about a change may be a one time affair, or repeatable. The former is the case with a stick of dynamite, a can of petrol and a pyrobenzamine tablet, no less than an aspirin. The latter is shown by the atmosphere, the sea, an electric current and all those things which are not consumed in the process of manifesting their powers. The dissipation of power amongst things is on a rough continuum, depending on how far the manifestation of the power involves a change in the essential nature of the agent. The powers of the exploding petrol and of the avalanche are soon dissipated, since the exercise involves a change in the nature of these substances, so great as to involve a change in kind. Carbon dioxide and water are not petrol, nor is a heap of rocks and snow at the bottom of a hill an avalanche. The powers of the sea and of the atmosphere persist, since in manifesting these powers the essential nature of these substances is not changed. 3. In certain cases a power is perceivable in itself and while it is being exercised. We do not perceive waves and subsequently a diminished shore line, but we see the waves eating into the shore; not moving stones and subsequently debris, but an avalanche crushing things in its path, and 220</page><page sequence="13">Natural Powers and Powerful Natures so on. In other cases, such as the atmospheric pressure, the existence of the power or agency is inferred from the effects and the occasion of their production. 4. At one time a power statement attributed to a thing or substance may properly be analysed as a statement about potentialities and counter- facts, or possibilities, and at another time about actualities. We make both forms of attribution to petrol, one before the explosion and one after. In the former case the petrol exists but not the power manifestation, while in the latter the power manifestation exists but not the petrol. Once established, the concepts of power and physical agency can be used to make sense of the directionality involved in causality. Using our terminology one legitimate sense of cause can be phrased as 'N of p, plus x', i.e. the nature of a thing acting in specified circumstances, and one sense of effect as 'y'-where y is taken to mean 'the manifestation of some power to do or produce y'. Now the truth of N of p and x statements is necessary for the truth of y statements. But, considered strictly from the point of view of the logical relations involved, the truth of y statements is necessary for the truth of N of p and x statements. Hence if 'causality' were synonymous with 'necessary relation' it would be just as correct to say that the water going up the pump is the cause of the atmospheric pressure and the absence of air in the shaft, as it would be to say that atmospheric pressure plus the absence of air in the shaft is the cause of the water going up the pump. But this result is absurd, going against, as it does, our firm intuition that an effect must follow or be simultaneous with the cause that produces it. The ground of the intuition can only be that agencies or powers make things happen, and these actions, by definition, cannot run backwards in time. The crucial point that follows is this: while 'physical agency' or 'power' is identical with natural necessity, the former notions are required if natural necessity is to be distinguished from the straightforward logical sense of necessity through identification with which natural necessity has traditionally been criticized. Finally it should be noted that the Humean effort to ground the intuition of causal directionality on temporal priority of cause alone fails, because in fact some causes and effects are simultaneous. The moving knife cuts the orange. The cutting by the knife and the separation of the flesh of the orange, however, are not distinct in time but occur together. The cutting and the cut are conceptually as well as causally connected and could not be separate in time. They are not identical entities, however, since they refer to two distinct things, one an event and the other a state of affairs. And the event figures as part of the cause of the state of affairs. If the cutting of the orange seems to bring in human agency, and so vitiate the example, we have only to conceive of the knife being wielded by some mechanical device. If this mechanism or the very concept of a knife seems still to bring in human agency on a second level, then consider such an example i6 22I</page><page sequence="14">R. Harre and E. H. Madden as the desert stone, dislodged by frost, which in its fall breaks the eagle's egg. Indeed most cases of causation in nature involve the simultaneous production of the effect with the exercise of the power of the causal agent, which must have possessed the power before the causal process began. In summary, then, the epistemological argument which alleges that powers are not knowable, while their manifestations are, is turned by a denial of the alleged fact upon which the argument ultimately rests, that is that we do not perceive powers and potencies except in the field of our own actions. Locke, it seems, need not have accepted the epistemological argument, though we emphasize that the theoretical status which he assigned to all powers remains essential epistemologically for us; we agree with him that natural powers can be known by observation, even though we differ from him in emphasizing that not all powers and potencies are known in this way. Thus we can agree with Locke that from a theoretical point of view secondary qualities 'are nothing but powers to excite in us' the corresponding experiences, while repudiating the common premise of empiricists that powers never show themselves in our experience of nature. Thus 'potency', we would claim, is an empirical concept, and can be at least an element in the analysans of a concept of agency independent of our experience of human action. In discussing spontaneity we have already established a connexion between the latency element in the notion of a natural agent, and the internal accumulation of some substance or quasi-substance behind a barrier of only finite strength. This is not just a powerful image, controlling certain conceptions of the emotions as well as our manner of thought about natural agents, it is also a conceptual determinant, in that it provides a rubric according to which a great number of explanatory concepts in physics are fashioned. We can illustrate this with the example of motion, and at the same time explain the conceptual connexion between being in motion and being identified as the agent in an interaction. Increments in motion are supposed, in physics, to be accompanied by increments in a quasi-entity, 'kinetic energy'. The 'store' of kinetic energy is used as a latency concept to explain the power of bringing about changes which is manifested by the moving thing when its motion is arrested. Thus we are conceptually prepared to identify the agent with the mover, through the theoretical connexion between increment of motion and increment of energy. The fact that the choice of mover is ultimately arbitrary, and the degree of its motion relative, has no bearing upon the validity of the conceptual system we are advocating, since the system is applied only after a choice of inertial frame has settled a priori all such questions as to the identification of the mover. This point is already clear in Kant's treatment of phoronomy, the general metaphysics of motion,9 and its 9 I. Kant, The Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science, translated by E. B.

There can be no question that the damage done by a moving ball to a stationary pane is both real and considerable, and it is to be accounted for in terms of the same system of concepts as is to be used to account for the damage a moving pane suffers when it strikes a stationary ball. That the ball is never the one who suffers in this interchange of frames of reference is to be explained by the contingent fact that relatively speaking very little change occurs in its intrinsic nature as a consequence of meeting the pane. Powers and Potentials The final stage in our argument will be to investigate the metaphysical properties of those entities of natural science which most nearly exemplify these concepts of power and agency. There are two concepts in use in physics which have the desired characteristics. We have already drawn attention to those features of the concept of energy which exactly fit it for the role of expressing the natures of those things which are for us close to fundamental. With the concept of the field we reach a notion in physics which through the concept of potential is most directly connected to the concepts of power and agency. In particular, a field of potentials is the most plausible candidate for an entity whose powers are its nature, so that if there are any entities which are fundamental then the field is the one most likely to be so, since it meets, through that characterization, the one indispensable condition for an entity to be fundamental in science. Fields are structures of spatially distributed potentials, enduring and changing with time. One is strongly inclined to reason a priori that from this characterization alone it follows that space and time are conceptually prior to fields, since these concepts are evidently required in order to provide even the most general characterization of the field. And yet it may turn out that in cosmology we may want to say that there is space and there is time only in so far as there is the universal field, that is that space and time exist only as relations amongst the states and component potentials of the field. It seems then that while space and time are concepts necessary to the characterization of the concept of the field, the field is an entity necessary to the existence of space and time. Conceptual priority does not imply existential priority. The same may be said for the material object metaphysics. It seems that a material object is necessarily that which occupies space and endures in time, but that for the concepts of space and time to have empirical application in the real world, material objects must exist as a necessary condition for the exemplification of these sets of relations. One might also add, in the spirit of the analyses offered by 223</page><page sequence="16">R. Harre and E. H. Madden Gassendil' and Strawson,11 that space and time depend for their existence only on the existence of material things in general, and not on any particular assemblage of them. In a similar vein one might argue that space and time depend upon the existence of the field in general, and not on the existence of any particular distribution of its potentials in space and time. As Gassendi put it, space and time are systems of relations abstracted from any particular set of objects and events, but nevertheless conceptually related to the ideas of objects and events, that is we must conceive of space and time by an exercise of the imagination upon systems of things and changing states of things. The field, we said, is the field of potentials, the physicist's version of the concept of powers. Potentials are the causal powers of points, and are defined in terms of the effects they are likely to produce when a suitable test entity is at the given point. Of course we have long since abandoned the dispositionalist position that the potential at a point is only what the test body would do if it were there, in favour of the idea that a power is possessed in virtue of a nature, and thus, following in the wake of this conceptual revolution the potentials of the physicist's fields are its powers, that is the dispositions of the field in virtue of its having a certain nature at that point. No particular metaphysical significance yet lies in that characterization, since the concept of 'causal power at a point' leaves open the question of whether the nature responsible for it is independently characterizable, or whether the level is so fundamental that such powers are their natures. Ordinary material things have causal powers at each point, though in their case, the chemical and physical state, i.e. nature responsible for the powers, is capable of independent specification. In this way we are ready to assign and explain the causal powers appropriate to various points on the truncheon, the red hot poker, the nettle, and so on. In this respect fields do not differ from ordinary material things, nor from other classes of powerful particulars, such as the atmosphere, the water in a lake, and so on. Neither the occupancy of space nor the duration in time of a system of causal powers is sufficient to distinguish the concept of the field of potentials from that of the material thing. But fields can be shown to have certain features by which a conceptual and so metaphysical distinction can be made, by which they can be separated from the status of things. As Joske has perceptively pointed out12 there is no metaphysical justification whatever for treating the material object as what determines all thing concepts. Fluids are no less material than hard solid blocks. A lake or an atmosphere is as much a material thing as a rock or a plant. The success 10P. Gassendi, Syntagma (Lyon, i658), Book II, Ch.

Joske, Material Objects (London: Macmillan, i967). 224</page><page sequence="17">Natural Powers and Powerful Natures of the corpuscularian philosophy according to which lakes and atmospheres are swarms of rock-like, planet-like molecules must not blind us to the essential conceptual differences between these categories of material thing. When two fields meet they may relate in two distinct ways. They can continue to exist together in the same space and the same time, and in this respect they are quite distinct both from solids and from the meta- physical paradigm of thing, which obeys the solid-like principle that no two of them can exist in the same place at the same time. Since the days of Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures we have institutionalized within the corpuscularian philosophy the old metaphysical principle which allows two or more fluids to exist at the same time and the same place, and so preserved the universal application of the solid-like concept at the cost of reducing the concept of a fluid to that of a swarm of particles. The magnetic and the gravitational field can occupy the same place without merging. But fields may also relate in another way. When they meet they may cease to be two fields and become one. It is in this way that two magnetic fields relate when they come to occupy the same place at the same time. And of course one of the reasons for thinking the electric, magnetic and gravi- tational fields to be distinct in kind is that each can occupy the space of another in a different ontic category but in entering the territory of one of its own kind merges into it to become a new field, of which there is only one in that space. Fluids are not wholly unlike this, and once again before the advent of the reductive molecular theory the sparking of hydrogen and oxygen in the eudiometer to create vapour might have been seen in that light. There is some historical interest in this case, in that the error of Stephen Hales13 in interpreting the loss of volume produced by a mouse breathing in a sealed jar, or by combustion, as a loss of elasticity rather than as the extraction of a component gas, as Mayow had correctly interpreted the experiments in i68o, could be put down to a metaphysical predilection for the idea of the merging of fluids into one entity, considered meta- physically. The concept of fluid includes that of liquid and of gas. The field favours the latter. It is a characteristic and differentiating feature of liquids that though they have no fixed shape they do have a fixed boundary, while gases in the natural state, such as an atmosphere or an interstellar cloud do not have a clear boundary. But the field is different from both liquids and gases in another way. A field does not have a definite shape, and it has no sharp boundary, but it does have a very distinct structure. It is as structured as a solid crystalline thing, and very much more structured than either a liquid or a gas. It is worth noticing finally that though fields 13 S. Hales, Vegetable Staticks, edited M. Hoskin (London: Oldbourne, i962) (first published, 1727). 225-</page><page sequence="18">R. Harre and E. H. Madden do not have definite boundaries and share this conceptual distinction with fluids only of the gaseous type, unlike gases, which become tenuous and eventually can be said to have ended, from a theoretical point of view a field must be considered to extend throughout the universe and to be at least indefinite in extent. If we pursue this line of thinking a step further we come right up against a metaphysical problem of the greatest importance. What would be the status of the field of a unified field theory, in which the universal field filled all space and all apparently ontically differentiated fields were somehow seen to merge within it? How could we have the concept of the field as an individual, an individual with powers, capable of taking on all the metaphysical roles so ill performed by the old concepts of the substance with its qualities? It seems clear that for the ultimate field the concept of 'individual' would have no application. Such a field could not be conceived of as an individual with powers. However, it is not correct to take the easy positivist way out and say that so attenuated a being is no kind of entity at all. This error is the mirror of the mistake of one who argues that because both space and God must be infinite they must be identical. If there were a God his powers would be distributed and exercised in space, but the distinction between his being, his powers and the spatially extended ground necessary for their display remains undisturbed. This is nothing but the application of the general conceptual distinction between space and place. Neither space nor God if infinite would in the ordinary sense have places, and thus they would not qualify to be treated as indi- viduals, since the ordinary notion of an individual is related not to space but to place, in that ordinary things are individuated by the places they occupy as well as the properties they display. But there would be no impropriety in thinking of space and God both as being present at every place, God through the contingent presence of certain potentialities at the various places, space through the necessary connexion between space and the totality of places. Since neither is an individual there can be no rivalry between them as to their existence. The infinite field has no place, but because we suppose that there are internal differentiations of some sort within the universal field, that is that it has some structure, derived from the differentiation of potentials in space and through time, the concept of place does have application within the field. But were there to be no structure, if the field were quite uniform, a pond with no waves, the field would still be extended though the concept of 'place' could have application neither to it nor within it. A still pond has places on it by reference to the differentiated scenery of its banks, but an infinite pond has no banks, and in the absence of any disturbances there are no places within it. How then, if this is the status of the one great field, can it be said to exist? To get to the bottom of this problem we need to examine and develop an assumption which is involved in the epistemology surrounding 226</page><page sequence="19">Natural Powers and Powerful Natures the existence of ordinary material things. The ordinary modes of reference by which we pick out material things serve both to identify an entity, that is pick it out as what it is, and to individuate it, that is pick it out from all other entities. These elements, though combined in ordinary acts of reference, are nevertheless distinct. The latter depends upon the principle that no two things may be in the same place at the same time, since it is upon this principle that the individuation of a thing by reference to its place depends. But that metaphysical principle is not involved in the identification of an entity, since we may well identify entities which, not being things, violate this general rubric. For instance a wall and a spot of light are at the same place and may be separately identified, but their individuation cannot depend upon their occupancy of referentially different places since they are at the same place, and the same act of reference serves to pick out both of them. For ordinary material things the act which individuates and the act which identifies go together, since identifiably different individuals must occupy different places. For any entity which purports to be universal, identification and individuation cannot go together upon the same metaphysical peg, since universal entities do not have places. But since they do exist in space they can be referred to and of course they can be identified as being of this or that kind. Absolute space is easy to identify, any act of pointing will point to an element of it, but it cannot be individuated since the points of it cannot be re-identified. It is through the concept of a singularity within the field that field identification is possible. Singularities become reference points. By appoint- ing to a singularity the field of which it is a singularity is shown at least to exist. And since there is a conceptual connection between being that singularity and an element of that field, identification of singularities necessarily identifies fields. But since there is no room for individuation, these acts do not individuate fields, so we are free to interpret the singu- larities as being the structured elements of a unified and universal entity, the great field. Compare the way we can identify people, by their faces. Faces are parts of people, but the identification of a person by his face does not show that people are not essentially bodies too. Like the concept of singularity a human face is conceptually related to that of which it is an identifying mark. This is perhaps what lies behind the shock produced by the expression, 'faceless people'. Singularities come to play this identifying role because they are associated with referents suited in a practical way to our senses. The identification of a magnetic field by reference to its poles can hardly be unconnected with the fact that these poles are found to lie in the pieces of visible and tangible iron by which our first acquaintance with the magnetic field is mediated. But that the framework of magnets, Earth and Sun, solenoids and so on is in use for individuating fields seems quite contingent, though of course it is necessary that we have some reference framework. Were 227</page><page sequence="20">R. Harre and E. H. Madden we to be sensitive to magnetism the field and its changing and beautifully graded potentials would strike us just as a piece of plastic does now when it is put under stress and seen in polarized light. We would share a concept of existence with the people of magnetic sensibility, but we would use it in defence of a different ontology and a different set of ontic differentiae. It seems then that this metaphysical discussion can be summed up in the principle that a field is a distribution of potentials, fairly permanent causal powers, and that the establishment of its existence is through the usual device of identification, but that its special metaphysical character precludes a simple one to one correspondence between the referents of the identifying acts and the entity thus shown to exist. The field is one and its identifying singularities many. Thus the individuation and identification of a field are distinct. In this way it differs fundamentally from a thing, even such a thing as a gas or liquid, since it is characteristic of material things of all ontic forms that they are individuated in the process by which they are shown to exist. Does the field so conceived meet the requirements that might be demanded of an entity which is to be the occupant of the ultimate level of a scientific explanation? Ordinarily the pattern of behaviour of some thing or material is explained by reference to the internal structure and properties of its components. Generally speaking we begin the progression to the ultimate by explaining the behaviour of something by reference to the powers of its component parts. More rarely patterns of phenomena are referred to the entities in which the phenomenon is embedded. The ultimate level of scientific investigation would either be marked by reference to entities which had no components in terms of which their powers could be explained, or by reference to entities which were not themselves components of still grander entities whose influences their behaviour advertised. We think it interesting to discuss this question in a somewhat different idiom from that we have adopted so far. A good deal of light can be thrown on the conception of field and of the specification of an ultimate entity by using the distinction between extensive and intensive magnitudes. An extensive magnitude is some quality or property the degree of which is related to a measure of space or of time, since only space and time are such that their differences are also spaces and times. Area and volume and duration are extensive magnitudes. An intensive magnitude is one the degree of which is not related to any measure of space or of time. Degree of hotness and intensity of colour are intensive magnitudes. It is contingently the case that to us, equipped with the senses we have, many intensive magnitudes must be displayed along with a quality or property that has an extensive magnitude. Thus colour is usually displayed over an area, and scent through a volume, though both scent and colour have good title to be intensive magnitudes. 228</page><page sequence="21">Natural Powers and Powerful Natures It is clear that primary qualities must necessarily be extensive magni- tudes. We have noticed too that for- many secondary qualities it is a necessary condition for their being capable of manifestation to our senses that they be displayed along with an extensive magnitude. Further, since both primary and secondary qualities can be explained in terms of powers which do not involve either kind of quality, the ultimate level of explanation, if it is couched in terms of powers, need not involve primary or secondary qualities. So it need not involve the kind of magnitude common to both kinds of qualities, namely extensive magnitude. The properties of the ultimate then may be intensive magnitudes, capable of existing at a mere point, and for an instant only. Is there anything from our conceptual system which is not a secondary property, and yet could exist as an intensive magnitude? Powers as potentials seem to have the right characteristics and status to meet the demand both that they are not qualities, and that they have intensive magnitude. Potential, for instance, is clearly an intensive magni- tude, since it is attributed to points; but it has degrees, since the potentials of different points may be different, and the potential of a particular point may change. We might be tempted to construe the ultimate field as an ensemble of ultimate individuals each identified by having a certain potential and each individuated by being at a certain place in the space-time framework. As we shall see the idea that the places of the space-time framework can serve to individuate the ultimate entities is fraught with difficulties, since by our argument concerning the conditions for the attribution of places within the great field, these places can be marked only by reference to the potentials we attribute to them. It seems then that we cannot on pain of circularity use places in the great field to individuate potentials. It would follow from these considerations that the great field could be no more than the ensemble of its potentials, and that places within it would be identified via the individuation of potentials with respect to their intensive magnitudes, and the structure of intensive magnitudes of their neighbours. That we leave behind the possibility of explaining the structure and relations of the distributed potentials is just what we would expect if we are in fact at the level of an entity whose properties are its powers. We must emphasize again that for no given field of potentials can we know that it is at the level of which this identity is true. All we can do is to give a specifica- tion of the ultimate; we cannot identify it even (or perhaps particularly) if it is in front of our very eyes, so to speak. Just as corpuscularianism had two versions, the theory of the aether and the theory of action at a distance, the espousal of one or the other depending on how deep one thought one was in the investigation of the world and its processes, in the search for the ultimate, so the theory of individuals with powers is likely to bifurcate at the same relative point. 229</page><page sequence="22">R. Harre and E. H. Madden There could be a metaphysics which recognized only point-centres of power, i.e. potentials as ultimately real and thing-like, but which made of their structured interrelations the ultimate mystery. And there could be a metaphysics which recognized the field as ultimately real and fluid- like, and the potentials as its causal powers. But we do not think that it is wise to try to construct a new monadology which would try to have it both ways. Linacre College, Oxford State University of New York, Buffalo 230</page></plain_text>
