<plain_text><page sequence="1">first word THE CULTURED BODY n October 2002 the University of Iowa hosted an international conference that demonstrated the rich potential of the body and its adornments as springboards for research into political, historical, economic, re- ligious, and, of course, aesthetic practices. "The Cultured Body: African Fashion and Body Arts" focused on a variety of themes, includ- ing the global reach of African forms of adorn- ment and the body as a tool for political power and resistance as well as a source of inspira- tion for contemporary African studio arts. The discussions ranged widely, placing the body at the center of a constellation of subjects and artistic expressions that were focused on but not limited to the African continent. Generous funding from several sources at the university enabled us as organizers (Victoria Rovine, University of Iowa Museum of Art; Sarah Adams, University of Iowa School of Art and Art History) to bring together a large group of scholars-nineteen in all-for two-and-a- half very full days of panels and lively discus- sion.1 Equally important, as we will describe, we organized a corollary conference, held on the last day, that showcased innovative re- search in a variety of disciplines by six Uni- versity of Iowa graduate students. The proceedings of the '"he Cultured Body" reflect the state of African art history, which, like any vigorous field of academic endeavor, is constantly shifting-admitting new realms of inquiry, submitting old subjects to new meth- ods of analysis, and seeking analytical tools from neighboring as well as distant areas of study. Ideally, conferences provide a forum for original research presented in new combina- tions, revealing changing currents of analysis. One also hopes that the resulting discussions will shape these currents into a sustainable direction that informs research beyond the immediate subjects at hand. We conceived of "The Cultured Body" as a way to facilitate productive encounters be- tween different art historical methodologies, between art history and other disciplines, and between Africanists and non-Africanists. In spring 2001 we began discussing possible top- ics for a conference in the on-going series of African-art gatherings sponsored by PASALA (Project for the Advanced Study of Art and Life in Africa). We soon realized that the fundamen- tal link between our own research projects is an interest in the body (Adams on uli body and mural painting, and more recently on contem- porary studio artists who use the body as a source of aesthetic and spiritual inspiration; Rovine on textiles, garments, jewelry, and other body arts). A symposium on this subject would offer an opportunity to build on this common concern. Presentations addressed topics as varied as contemporary haute couture design, the cen- Continued on page 4 winter 2002 * afrlcan arts 1</page><page sequence="2">TRIBAL REALITY AFRICAN ART a) -1 C) co n _ Dn ? z JOHN FALCON 23rd Street at 7th Avenue New York City (212) 924-8346 BY APPOINTMENT ONLY ~rr~ r~rrrS INDIGO FOLKARTS AND TEXTILES FROM AFRICA, ASIA AND THE PACIFIC 530 NORTH THIRD STREET MINNEAPOLIS, MN 55401 612/333-2151 , - first word continuedfrom page 1 turies-old trans-Saharan trade in gold jewelry, and body politics in South Africa as expressed through beaded jewelry and mantles as well as studio artists' production. We also sought to present a subject that would have broad appeal to nonspecialists, drawing in members of the larger public. A diversity of voices, we hoped, would propel the conference into uncharted territory. We were not disappointed. As students of two pioneers in the field, Roy Sieber and Robert Farris Thompson, we came to this subject through our mentors' ground- breaking research.2 In his landmark book and exhibition African Art in Motion (1974), Thomp- son first asserted the body's central place in studies of African art. He continues to draw at- tention to the body as powerful aesthetic state- ment through his studies of the performative aspects of African arts-masquerade, dance, and gesture. Roy Sieber's 1972 exhibition and catalogue African Textiles and Decorative Arts is recognized as the first serious art historical presentation of this subject. More recently, his Hair in African Art and Culture (2000, with Frank Herreman) provided an unprecedented survey of an ephemeral art form. Dr. Sieber died in 2001, and in recognition of his impact on nearly all the participants in the conference, we ded- icated "The Cultured Body" to his memory. During breakfast with us in Iowa City sev- eral months before he passed away, Dr. Sieber described his theory of fieldwork. Many a stu- dent, in the midst of panicked efforts to identi- fy a topic for doctoral research, has heard it: a graduate student dropped from an airplane anywhere on the African continent should be able to find a topic and conduct research suffi- cient to write a dissertation. Sieber would like- ly have been intrigued by the fact that none of the papers presented at "The Cultured Body" could have been researched in this manner. For most of the presenters, a single site served as a mere starting point, the crossroads through which global forces transit and interact with local cultures. In fact, a graduate student para- chuting into an African town or village would soon have to travel to neighboring towns, to distant regions, and perhaps to Europe, India, or North America in order to conduct research. Additionally, as more African scholars enter the field, parachutes are no longer always neces- sary-many students of African art begin their research at home. Our call for papers sought presentations on African body arts broadly defined. Only after the roster was complete did we recognize the conference's striking subtext: in their topics, the vast majority of papers traveled outside Africa in order to elucidate African forms and practices. The responses suggested other re- vealing information about the field. With just one exception (Enid Schildkrout on Mangbetu cranial modification), all the proposals were about ephemeral adornments. Proposals on "irreversible modifications"-scarification, tat- tooing, and other means of literally shaping the body-were nearly absent. We can only specu- late as to the reasons for this omission, which may include a reluctance to address practices african arts U C L A editors Maria C. Berns Donald J. Cosentino Steven Nelson Allen F.

In another indication of a shift in the field, we received several proposals on studio artists who engage the body in their work. Consider- ing the ground broken by several prominent exhibitions and publications on contempo- rary African art (including the much discussed "Short Century"), we were struck but not sur- prised by these papers' approach: they bypassed the formerly obligatory basic introduction to the artist accompanied by declarations of the existence of important African studio artists, and moved instead to a detailed examination of one aspect of their subject's oeuvres. In a simi- lar vein, we received numerous proposals on topics related to fashion design-contemporary art in another medium. "The Cultured Body" incorporated these and other thematic foci, thus examining the body and its adornments from many angles. The disciplinary diversity of the partici- pants, who included art historians, historians, and anthropologists, matched the wide range of subjects. Within the large contingent of art his- torians, the conference included those who examined African body arts from the fields of contemporary art, Diaspora arts, and popular- culture studies, as well as connoisseurship and formal analysis. Presenters approached the theme from several distinct positions, creat- ing multilayered biographies of African body 6 adornments. The discussants did much to ex- tend the broad scope of the proceedings even further. Faculty from several departments and programs at the University of Iowa-among them Anthropology, Women's Studies, History, and Sculpture-read and responded to the pre- sentations on each of the five panels. None of the discussants were Africanists; their responses were drawn from research on Latin American, Amazonian, and Native American cultures. The conference's keynote address also served to open the exhibition "The Cultured Body: African Body Adornments" (through April 2003). Joanne Eicher introduced the sub- ject, touching on fashion, textiles, body modifi- cations, and the adaptations of African forms to non-African contexts. The panels that fol- lowed during the next three days reflected and magnified these issues. Although limited space precludes a discussion of all the papers, we will briefly describe the panels and one or two papers on each. As we divided the proceedings into thematic categories, we found that the panels spoke to one another in surprising and evocative ways. The panel "Reexamining the Traditional" looked at revivals and re-adaptations of adorn- ments that are defined as "traditional" within various cultures. Karen Milbourne focused on a single body-that of Barotse king Lewanika- and examined the many ways in which body and attire signal geopolitical positioning. In her discussion of dress and ethnic identity among a variety of Ethiopian groups, Peri Klemm described how Oromo spirit mediums use adornment and body modification to at- tract and repel spirits. The second panel, "Inside/ Outside Africa: Travels of People and Adornments," addressed the transnational movements by which objects and styles are dispersed and transformed. Both Kristyne Loughran and Victoria Rovine examined the burgeoning field of African fashion design, paying particular attention to designers whose work references indigenous forms and to West- ern designers influenced by those forms. Leslie Rabine provided a focused study of the Sotiba textile company, whose designers use "tradi- tional" motifs to produce "authentic" forms for both African and non-African markets. Friday's third panel, "Contemporary Studio Arts and the Body," dealt with body imagery in the work of three artists. Chika Okeke's paper explored "The Rainbow Series," a collection of photo- montages by South African artist Candice Breitz. Okeke's comparison of Breitz's work to Ger- man artist Hannah Hoch's 1925-26 collages, the Ethnographic Museum Series, yielded a new reading of Breitz's work, one deeply rooted in the images themselves. Gary van Wyk's paper on Berni Searle and Sarah Adams's on Ibrahim el Salahi traced body imagery and body themes in the current oeuvres of those artists. On the second day, the conference began with a panel on clothing and textiles, "Fashion and Invention: Weaving Tradition."

Joanna Grabski examined the global- ized world of fashion emerging from Dakar's streets and ateliers. The final panel of the main conference, "Beads, Hair, Jewelry, and Identity," added significant historical depth to the pro- ceedings. Labelle Prussin's work on jewelry as a commodity in the trans-Saharan trade re- minded us all that globalization has long been at work in Africa. Daniel Mato's examination of Akan coiffures extended the study of hair- styles back in time through terracotta me- morial figures, documenting the changes and consistencies in these styles. Held on the third day, the graduate con- ference, which included students from many departments at the University of Iowa, ad- 8 dressed the body more generally, not just in Africa. Interest in studio artists continued here with Kimberly Cleveland's analysis of critical responses to Brazilian artist Mario Cravo Neto's work. Sarah Clunis's paper traced body imagery in Trinidadian artist Susan Dayal's photographs and sculptures. Clunis's and Cleve- land's focus on diaspora artists created a strong link to the global undercurrents of the larger conference. Almut Haboeck discussed the Viennese Actionists' 1968 performance piece Art and Revolution as a visceral expression of the body politic and Foucault's notion of biopower. Kellie Beers looked at reactions to and interpretations of white women with dreadlocks, while Gitti Salami examined ibal- ibali and eblami, women's body arts in south- eastern Nigeria. Though they addressed the subject from a variety of directions, all of the conference's pre- sentations called into question the separation of artistic practices into binary categories such as traditional/modem, authentic/inauthentic, and art/craft. In addition, several participants documented how the boundaries between "African" and "Western" are being challenged by the movements of people, objects, and styles. Only by traversing disciplines and regions of study can we begin to apprehend the many ways in which Africans have used body adornment as a means of communicating ideas, exercising power, expressing identities, and adapting to change. Such a global perspec- tive also enables us see how non-Africans have used African images and forms to construct identities-their own as well as others'. These constructions of identities through the body and its adornments often carry powerful political and economic implications. Many of the presentations that addressed the colonial period touched on the use of bodies by both colonizer and colonized to negotiate their positions. Other papers demonstrated that in contemporary Western contexts, allusions to Africa through adornments and images such as those found in colonial-era postcards and con- temporary fashion photography still carry the weight of colonization and its aftermath. The African body has for centuries been an object of much fascination to Western observers, who framed it to fuel many misconceptions about the continent's peoples and cultures. The colo- nialist image of the "naked savage" long poi- soned the relationship between African and Western peoples; the forced or coerced aban- donment of indigenous attire in favor of West- ern dress was for much of the past two centuries a symbolof the "civilizing" process. Throughout Africa today, deliberate revivals of "traditional" forms serve as symbols of political and cultural movements, often coexisting with Western styles that have been modified to suit local tastes. The subject of African body arts is particu- larly resonant in a university environment, where tattooing and body piercing have be- come popular. The Modem Primitives move- ment in the United States transformed the aesthetics and meanings of body art. Its advo- cates used the non-Western body arts they saw in books and in their travels as sources of inspi- ration for their own body projects. We might ask, then, if contemporary Western forms such as tattooing and body piercing have roots in non-Western cultural forms or whether they are wholly new creations that reflect Africa in the Western imagination. Can we frame them as mere attempts to assert a sense of "authen- ticity" through association with African and other cultures? What are the implications of these appropriations? We hope that, formally or informally, these and other issues were dis- cussed among conference attendees, many of whom likely wear such body modifications. Participants told us that it is increasingly common for Africanists to teach courses on body arts (as do Joanne Eicher, Enid Schild- krout, Peri Klemm, and Sarah Adams) or to address the body at length within the context of more broadly defined survey courses (Sylvester Ogbechie, Carol Boram-Hays, Joanna Grabski). These courses are not necessarily limited to Africa. We feel that this trend in the classroom closely mirrors conference participants' general interest in the body and their overwhelmingly global approaches in their own research. Finally, we wish to note two other experi- ences from "The Cultured Body," both of which emerge directly out of the globalization that so many presentations addressed. One was a reminder of the negative reverberations that international networks may create. One invitee to the conference, Alfred Anangwe, an inde- pendent scholar based in Nairobi, was, in the final weeks of planning, unable to obtain a visa to come to the United States. Though scholars from a number of African countries have for many years encountered similar problems, we saw this unfortunate event as heralding what will likely be a long period of difficulty assem- bling international conferences because of po- litical tensions in the post-9/11 era. Clearly, globalization can create permeable borders or impenetrable barriers. On the positive side, we plan to extend the life of "The Cultured Body" by using the glob- alizing technologies of the Internet. The conference Web site3 allowed us to increase nonparticipant awareness of the event, and as a result we had attendees from all over the United States and from Morocco and the United King- dom. Because so many people at the close of the proceedings expressed interest in maintain- ing a dialogue with the participants, we are currently working with the Obermann Center for Advanced Studies, whose designer created the Web site, to transform it into a permanent Web community focused on Africa and the body. It will create an important forum for continu- ing some of the conversations that grew out of "The Cultured Body." We would like to thank conference partici- pants and attendees, many of whom have passed along much-appreciated positive feed- back. Perhaps the most flattering comment was from Christine Mullen Kreamer, who ex- claimed as she stepped onto the shuttle bus on the last day of the conference, "It was like a vacation!"

Major contributions to the study of Ogboni brasses include the following: Morton-Williams 1960, 1964; Williams 1964, 1974; Thompson 1971; Dobbelman 1976; Roach-Selk 1978; Brincard 1982; Witte 1988; Drewal 1989; Drewal, Pemberton III &amp; Abiodun 1989; Gosline 1989, 1992; Lawal 1995. 4.

A duplicate set can be found at the Eliot Elisofon Photographic Archives, National Museum of African Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C. I should note that I have seen the images; as Fagg indicated that the carvings were from Ila Orangun, they are quite different from the works under consideration here, in terms of not only style but iconography. 6. A related work is 87.R.234, apparently a more recent version of a standing Ogboni official in the style of the Adugbologe workshop in Abeokuta (H. 89cm). 7.

I want to thank the university's Department of Art History and Archae- ology for sponsoring that position, and Terry Gips, then the Art Gallery's director, for overseeing it.

I thank you all. 8. The sash is named itagbe in Ijebu and shaki among the Egba. See Aronson 1992:101, n. 29. Such cloths function as emblems of power and rank, particularly for chiefs and Ogboni or Osugbo members (Aronson 1992:53). The bird-surmounted hat is vari- ously called fila, ate, or akete (Babatunde Lawal, personal com- munication, April 5, 2001). Henry Drewal uses the term ege to denote these wide-brimmed hats, which he relates to the head- gear of sixteenth- or seventeenth-century Catholic (Iberian or Italian) clergy (see Drewal 1989:167). 9. Concerning this system of fashioning composite objects, Hans Witte also notes: "Not only were the figure-groups assembled from different statues, but many Egungun masks from Abeokuta are nothing but an assemblage of separate pieces nailed around the main figure. It suggests there was something of an Adugbologe carving factory where separate pieces were carved in advance, so that a mask could be put together according to the client's wishes. In these circum- stances it becomes, of course, difficult to assign a mask to one carver" (personal communication, April 16, 2002). 10.
