<plain_text><page sequence="1">Action and Narration in Psychoanalysis Roy Schafer F REUD EMPLOYED the term metapsychology to indicate that he was setting forth the general assumptions of a psychoanalytic psy- chology and the rules of conceptualization and explanation that would govern this psychology. The most general assumptions are these: psychoanalysis is a natural science; it is a general psychology; its method is introspective; its explanations are deterministic; and the pragmatic reality and moral principles to which many of its proposi- tions refer are simply given and unambiguously knowable through scientific methods and sound personal judgment. Freud's rules of conceptualization are of a mixed sort in that they are appropriate both to a Newtonian machine and a Darwinian or- ganism. In its mechanistic aspect, metapsychology is designed to yield accounts of the person as a mental apparatus. This apparatus is both constituted and controlled by principles (pleasure, reality), structures (id, ego, superego), mechanisms (defenses), and functions (reality testing, synthesis, etc.). The apparatus is made to work by mental energies (libido, aggression, and their modified forms). The status of processes in the mental apparatus may be conscious, preconscious (largely verbal and more or less easily made conscious), and uncon- scious (like the dream, largely imagistic and concrete, and made con- scious only under special circumstances such as pathological weakness or creative relaxation of the ego's defenses or the inroads of the psychoanalytic process). The Darwinian organism enters as the car- rier of instinctual drives (the source of the libidinal and aggressive energies), inherited emotional reaction tendencies (bisexuality, cer- tain fears and aversions), and a capacity to develop from an initial state of helplessness to one of adaptation to an environment largely hostile to its instinctual nature. The explanations that are governed by these assumptions and rules concern the normal and pathological features of individual psychological development and subjective experience and, to a lesser extent, the development of social groups; they also concern certain aspects of such cultural phenomena as art, ritual, myth, and jokes. Freud's metapsychology has continued to dominate much of the theorizing engaged in by Freudian analysts. That it is crudely positivistic and that its mechanistic concepts are obsolete have been CopyrightÂ© 1980 by New Literary History, The University of Virginia</page><page sequence="2">NEW LITERARY HISTORY made increasingly plain by advances in the theory of knowledge about (or interpretation of the activities of) human beings and the world they inhabit. Against Freud's nineteenth-century assumptions and preconceptions stand today's relativistic or pluralistic conceptions of methods, data, and reality; and there is as well the contemporary emphasis on the formative role of language in establishing what we claim to do, know, and understand. Additionally, modern devel- opments in biology have shown that there is no longer much to rec- ommend Freud's theory of instinctual drives and energies (consid- ered apart from his stress on infantile psychosexuality). Con- sequently, for the health and soundness of the general theory of Freudian psychoanalysis, it is necessary to develop contemporary al- ternatives to metapsychology. I have been developing one such alternative. I call it action lan- guage.1 In using action language, one systematically refrains from postulating autonomously acting mental entities such as mechanisms and psychic structures; one thereby restricts to an absolute minimum the use of blatantly anthropomorphic metaphors in giving theoretical accounts of the operations of these entities and their transformations. Far from accepting the project of making psychoanalysis a general psychology based on lists of instinctual drives and other such factors, one attends closely to the inextricable interrelationships of theory, method, and phenomena in the predominantly verbal clinical psy- choanalytic situation. One chooses a mode of conceptualization that matches the inescapably intersubjective, hermeneutic, and narrative features of that situation. What is action language? I have derived the formal aspects of action language from various sources in general philosophy and literary and historical studies. These formal aspects facilitate the operationalizing of psychoanalytic generalizations and preclude the customary reifica- tion of mental entities. One is now concerned with describing in a specialized way what people do in the psychoanalytic situation and how and why they do it. To this end, one relies on verbs and adverbs rather than nouns and adjectives; one thinks in terms of reasons for actions rather than the necessary and sufficient conditions of actions, that is, their causes in the strictly deterministic sense of causes; and one recognizes that in giving a specialized account of what people do, one is engaged in a narrational project. This project includes both what is told by analysand and analyst in the clinical situation and what is told about this dialogue in writings on psychoanalysis. Before going any further, it must be asserted that action language is not a new psychoanalysis. It is a new language for psychoanalysis. It is metatheoretical in that it specifies how it is best to conceive of and thus 62</page><page sequence="3">ACTION AND NARRATION IN PSYCHOANALYSIS to give accounts of psychoanalysis. And in its being essentially a set of language rules, it is applicable to all modifications of the content of Freud's empirical generalizations such as one finds in self psychology, object relations theory, and separation-individuation theory. With respect to competing empirical generalizations, action language is neutral. It is, however, true-and the argument that follows assumes this truth-that language is not an innocent and transparent vehicle of thought. Language does control the defining and understanding of methods and phenomena. Consequently, in employing action lan- guage as a form of linguistic control, one must expect to transform the selection and organization of methods and data, even if ever so slightly, and thereby to alter the empirical referents of psychoanalytic propositions. Still, in its not being a new psychoanalysis in the sense of a new set of empirical generalizations or a new technique, action language presents the familiar clinical features of Freudian psychoanalysis in a way that leaves them easily recognizable, even if seen in a different light. My discussion of action and narration in psychoanalysis has five sections. In the first section, I shall describe the psychoanalytic situa- tion as a series of narrative accounts of actions. In the second, I shall discuss the analysand's disclaiming of action as a narrative of special psychoanalytic importance. Third will be an account of self-reflexive statements as narrative actions. Fourth, the implications of talking "about" events as compared to the ideal observance of the free- association rule of psychoanalysis-simply talking. Finally, the psy- choanalytic project will be described as the narrative construction of a second reality. I. Narration in Psychoanalysis Psychoanalysts may be described as people who listen to the narra- tions of analysands and help them to transform these narrations into others that are more complete, coherent, convincing, and adaptively useful than those they have been accustomed to constructing. I em- phasize that analysts may be described in this way, for they have been described in other ways, most notably, of course, by Freud, who de- scribed them or what they do in several other ways. I want now to go on to explain the parts of the description I recommend. (1) The psychoanalyst. Today there are many kinds of clinical work that are called psychoanalysis. Each kind satisfies one or another un- derstanding of what it takes to meet the criteria of analyzing trans- 63</page><page sequence="4">NEW LITERARY HISTORY ference and resistance (in keeping with Freud's fundamental propo- sitions in this respect). I shall be speaking of the modern Freudian analyst. But let me caution at the outset that there is considerable dispute among those who do their work under this banner as to what is modern, what is Freudian, and what is analysis. Notwithstanding these disputes, most of these analysts would agree that the work of today's clinician is different in some crucial respects from the picture of the work Freud presented or implied in his writings; they would also agree that critical examination of Freud's texts alone, such as that done by some of the French writers, however valuable it may be, is arbitrarily ahistorical. Not only must one take into account advances beyond Freud in method, principles of interpretation, and general theory; one must also take into account that Freud has been shown to have presented many of his ideas and findings ambiguously and in some self-contradiction, and also to have misconceived crucial aspects of the discipline he founded. His major misconception was that psychoanalysis is a new natural science. On this basis, he would have rejected or at least criticized as incomplete or pretheoretical my de- scription of psychoanalysts as retellers of narrations. Consequently, when I refer in what follows to what Freud demonstrated, I shall be referring to my preferred modification and correction of his own views on the matter. My version, in turn, takes into account the views of many analysts other than Freud, though in the interest of brevity I shall not be explicit about this. In proceeding with this degree of independence, I am being no more presumptuous than a literary critic who dares to say what this or that poet or novelist was doing in a piece of writing, when this reading of the piece conflicts with the author's own explanations. It is not, after all, primarily the merit of the piece itself that is then in question; rather, it is the adequacy of the author's view of the piece, and to varying degrees that view may be incomplete if not confused or wrong. In principle, and without questioning Freud's genius as an interpreter of human action, anyone can claim to know better than Freud what the best conception of psychoanalysis is. More exactly, it would be a question of the best conception of psychoanalysisfor one or another purpose. Unfortunately, it has been traditional in Freudian scholarship to show that Freud knew it all or anticipated it all; at least it has been customary to invoke his authority about what psychoanalysis is or should be. For this reason, the remarkably innovative contributions of analysts as different as Melanie Klein, Heinz Hartmann, and Heinz Kohut can be shown to have been obscured and even diminished by their overconcern with the question of fidelity to Freud's judgments 64</page><page sequence="5">ACTION AND NARRATION IN PSYCHOANALYSIS about his innovative precepts and practices. None of the foregoing implies, however, that Freud on Freud should not be listened to carefully. His conceptions, while not altogether privileged, retain considerable authority, and much of what follows stems directly from his writings. If it sounds at this point as though I am talking out of both sides of my mouth, it is because many issues remain to be de- fined, not to say decided, and so it is wise not to be absolute about these matters. (2) The narrations of the analysand. This has two parts. (a) The analysand. The designation analysand is to be preferred over the far more familiar designationpatient. The word patient, which was usually used by Freud, manifests another of his self- misunderstandings. For what Freud showed, perhaps above every- thing else, is that, strictly speaking, neurotic persons are not diseased and thus are not to be understood as passive sufferers or victims, as the conventional use of the word patient instructs us to do. Rather, neurotics are more usefully viewed as unconsciously arranging their lives in such ways that they repetitively and more or less obscurely continue to enact certain prototypical scenes, conflictual courses of action, and crises of childhood. This is to say that Freud showed the neurotic to be the agent of the neurosis. The neurosis as lived and presented in the here and now of the analysis is the analysand's con- struction. It is an elaborately patterned compromise of interests or aims that, unconsciously, are viewed by the analysand as being so thoroughly and devastatingly incompatible with one another that they are dangerous to the survival of the physical and psychological self. The compromise entails inhibition, symptom-formation, consciously inexplicable anxiety, guilt or shame, actual and symbolic self- punishment, and so on. Patienthood does, of course, usually correspond to the analysand's consciously developed version of his or her status. But that narrative version is not psychoanalytic. It is conventional, and it is sanctioned by convention in the same way that convention sanctions other con- sciously prepared testimony.2 Freud may also be said to have shown the limitation of the argu- ment that the decisive infantile prototypes come into being in re- sponse to what happens to the child (the child as patient) rather than as actions of the child (the child as agent). On the basis of his account of psychosexual development and ego development, he demonstrated how one may systematically present the child as constructing experi- ence in the terms of aims and capacities appropriate to his or her stage or level of development. To put it schematically, the oral child con- structs experience in terms of breasts, milk, taking in, vomiting, tast- 65</page><page sequence="6">NEW LITERARY HISTORY ing good or bad, feeling full or empty or drowsy, etc.; the anal child constructs experience on the model of excrement as gift or weapon, scenes on the potty or in the toilet, and organs of elimination; and so on. To say that the child constructs experience is not to say that childhood is a time of pure fantasy; the events to which the child is exposed do matter a great deal, but for the psychoanalyst they matter on the basis of what the child makes of them. In showing how the child constructs his or her own experience, Freud was giving an account of the child, even the very young child, as performing intentional actions, as acting for reasons. Here, action must be understood broadly as including remembering, believing, wishing, and behaving emotionally, for any of these may be redesig- nated as performances that have their reasons. And Freud showed how to develop a coherent account of the adult in analysis as someone who is continuing to construct experience in terms of the infantile bodily zones and modes. In this account, even traumatic accidental events, those over which the child or adult could not conceivably have had any control, derive much of their impact from the construction put on them by their victim, that is, the meanings with which they are invested. In this narrative of actions and happenings or necessities, one avoids taking an either-or position. In other words, a sharp split between subject and object has no place in the psychoanalytic version of events. A simple positivist approach cannot be psychoanalytic. There are indeed happenings and necessities of existence. For example, the infant's biological equipment and its maturation in a necessarily influential social environment are given rather than con- structed. These are not actions of the child; they are happenings or necessities. But the term psychosexual indicates the analyst's narrative interest in showing what the child makes of this equipment and in- fluence and in showing how the child's earliest construction of expe- rience continues to be used by him or her as a template for construct- ing later experience. This story of zones and modes used as templates is, however, not the whole story, and it can be told and used without recourse to Freud's theory of innate instinctual drives. Thus, in addition to redescribing actions, the psychoanalyst devel- ops a specialized account of the sense given to happenings by the analysand at whatever stage of development these events occurred or are now being rehearsed. For instance, it is a familiar feature of psy- choanalytic narration to present people as characteristically assuming responsibility for having brought about the objectively given misfor- tunes and accidents in their lives, such as the death of loved ones; in these instances, the idea of a loss to be suffered is always compromised and perhaps overshadowed by the idea of a loss to atone for, the loss 66</page><page sequence="7">ACTION AND NARRATION IN PSYCHOANALYSIS being attributed to one's own devouring, expulsive, or rapacious de- signs on the lost person. In the terms of action language, these are instances of excessive claiming of action; in the terms of Freud's metapsychology, they are instances of superego guilt. In either case, the decisive constructions of experience are said to be effected un- consciously ("unconscious fantasy"). The opposite pole of excessive claiming of action is disclaiming of action. The idea that a neurosis is an affliction and that one suffers a neurosis passively is, according to the approach to human lives that was developed and systematized by Freud, to be designated an in- stance of consciously disclaimed action. (b) Narration. Freudian psychoanalytic interpretation is, in two respects, a systematic retelling of what someone is doing. First, it consistently redescribes the analysand's verbal and nonverbal com- munications. It redescribes them not only as being about actions but-and this is more important-as being actions in and of them- selves. Second, out of the innumerable possibilities of retelling the actions in question, the psychoanalytic interpreter selects those de- scriptions that center on sexual, hostile, conflictual, emotional, fan- tastic, repetitive, and other such familiar features of psychoanalytic content. In this second respect the psychoanalytic interpreter sys- tematically defines and organizes a set of interrelated themes for the distinctive narrative account that is to be given of the analysand's present actions. This is the perspective on psychoanalysis I shall be developing. Although other perspectives are, as I mentioned, possible, I shall bracket out any detailed consideration of them in order not to get lost in the minimally charted field of comparative psychoanalysis. As I indicated earlier, the assertions I have made thus far will perhaps seem a far cry from the standard readings of psychoanalysis. Tradi- tionally, psychoanalysis emerges either as an introspective method concerned with unconscious subjectivity or as a life-historical ap- proach to the individual viewed as a set of forces and psychic struc- tures or multiple selves; or else it emerges as a study of the propulsive force of biologically rooted drives, drives out of which a more or less precariously rational person must somehow be fashioned. But giving an account of what psychoanalysis is about is itself a narrative action. Consequently, what I have said so far can only be one segment of the narrative I am constructing. What is to be noted at this point is how different my narrative seems to be from the common positivistic, naively empiricist account of psychoanalysis. The traditional case report does not seem to corre- spond to what I have been saying; neither do the theoretical discus- 67</page><page sequence="8">NEW LITERARY HISTORY sions coordinate to these reports. But it is, I submit, a question of how one views or describes even these presentations, and thus it is a ques- tion of what sorts of narratives one takes them to be. One does have options in this respect. And here we catch a glimpse of a way of developing a comparative psychoanalysis, that is, through an ap- proach to the teachings of different schools as different narrative accounts of the psychoanalytic enterprise. To continue with my narrative: literary theorists have examined the roles of showing and telling in narration.3 This work is applicable to the psychoanalytic dialogue. During the course of the analysis, the analysand engages in a good deal of telling; typically, it is telling in the past tense. The analysand tells about the past, about his or her present life outside the analysis, about his or her life within the analysis. I shall reserve the term telling for those times when the analysand is talking "about" events. At other times the analysand seems to be showing rather than telling. These are the times when the analysand seems most freely to be associating unselectively and without rehearsal, that is, to be either voicing or nonverbally conveying ideas, fantasies, feel- ings, or reactions in a way that appears to be minimally mediated by selection and arrangement. Then he or she seems to be operating very much in the present tense, even when speaking of the past. If one takes into account the way the analyst is listening, however, the line between showing and telling virtually disappears, just as it often does in literary analysis. In the interest of focusing on trans- ference and resistance, the analyst will be listening to every telling as a present action and thus as a showing. For instance, the analyst may see a prolonged dwelling on the past as a form of resistant action in the present. And moving in the reverse direction, that is, from showing to telling, the analyst may listen to the most unprepared communica- tions, those which most closely approximate pure showing, as implicit tales of past formative experiences, tales that are being unconsciously and repetitively enacted in the present. For instance, the most spon- taneous railing against the analyst as a cruel SOB may be heard as a telling of how the analysand came to experience his or her father or mother in this way, and, on this hearing, it will be used to raise life- historical questions. These questions will center on the real or imag- ined events and actions of others that were experienced as cruel, on why they were experienced in this way, and on whether they were also experienced in other ways (e.g., as sexually exciting). Common sense alone tells us that, on the average, a guilty child will construct a more threatening experience of a father exercising his paternal authority than a child who is not guilty. Common sense also tells us that a father who is generally intolerant of infantile modes of 68</page><page sequence="9">ACTION AND NARRATION IN PSYCHOANALYSIS action will be playing an influential part in predisposing the child to become a guilty child of a certain sort. And psychoanalysis has en- hanced our recognition that punitive and guilty interactions may be- come a form of sexual relationship. In its life-historical aspect, psy- choanalytic investigation defines this set of vicious circles and traces their development, and in its specialized way it formulates reasons for their active, though unconscious, repetition by the analysand in the present analytic relationship. In brief, the analyst may be said to be asking two questions: "What is the analysand showing at this time by telling me this or that?" and with equal appropriateness, "What is the analysand telling me at this time by showing me this or that?" On this account of the analytic dialogue, both the analyst and the analysand may be viewed as agents engaged in a narrational study of agency. It is particularly the agency of the analysand that is in question, although when it comes to what is called counter-transference and the technique of analysis, the agency of the analyst will be in question as well. Yet another of Freud's misconceptions must be noted here: his formal account of free association is faulty. He often viewed the free association method as a study of chainlike sequences of ideas that are directed and linked by the force of a drive and that have a revealing end point; he also viewed this method as an introspective consulting of what goes on in the theater of the mind on the analogy of a pas- senger looking out of a window of a moving train. In this formal account, the analysand is not being presented as constructing at each moment the thoughts allegedly being introspectively observed; further, it is as though there is unquestionably a theater of the mind. According to Freud's account of the process, it is not possible or sufficient to say of the free-associating analysand simply this: "Now he or she is thinking this or saying that and doing so in this way and for these reasons." Viewing Freud as a narrator, it is as though he was saying that it is not possible to present psychoanalysis as a method of systematically giving a certain kind of account of what the analysand is doing at any given moment (so far as possible) and of what may be told, in some distinctively psychoanalytic narration, about these ac- tions considered in the context of the analysand's life history, present life situation, and situation in the analysis itself. Freud's formal ac- count does not present his own method of using and interpreting free association as accurately as the account I have just given. In the more exact narrative of free association, it is neither free nor association: it is rule-governed narration; and only when it is viewed as such may it be retold (interpreted) in other ways that are better suited to the purposes peculiar to the psychoanalytic project. 69</page><page sequence="10">70 NEW LITERARY HISTORY II. The Analysand's Disclaiming of Action In my recent publications, I have been identifying the many locu- tions analysands use to disclaim their own actions.4 Examples are: "The impulse overwhelmed me" and "The thought of you slipped away." I have emphasized particularly the defensive or resistant value of disclaiming. What is being defensively disclaimed is the personal agency that would be plain if the analysand were to say instead: "I did the very thing that I consciously and urgently did not want to do" and "Unexpectedly, I stopped thinking of you." By attributing agency to impulses and thoughts rather than to oneself, the analysand disavows responsibility. Thereby the analysand attempts to preclude the ex- periencing of his or her actions in an anxious, guilty, ashamed, or otherwise disturbing manner. Through such disclaiming, one simply appears as the victim or witness of happenings whose origins and explanations lie entirely outside one's own sphere of influence- outside the "self," as some would say. In using disclaimers, the analysand is constructing experience in a way that is different from acknowledging personal agency. Accord- ingly, any spontaneous restatement in action terms changes the mode of constructing experience. The two types of statement are not syn- onymous. The analysand's switching to action language, when it is not merely compliant, transforms experience rather than translates or paraphrases it. I have also been emphasizing the rich store of disclaiming locutions in our common language. We learn to disclaim in learning to speak and think, which is to say in learning how to live in a human fashion. The art of disclaiming is a basic lesson in our socialization. This re- source is useful in regulating emotional difficulties. As a rule, for example, it is more comfortable to say, "I couldn't get away from my thoughts of him" than it is to say, "I continued to think of him no matter how much I resolved to stop doing so," and the difference between the two is this: in the former, disclaimed version, one is narrating thoughts as pursuing a single-minded, even if harried, self, whereas in the latter, action version, one is narrating that one has been performing contradictory actions and does not understand why one has been doing so. Ordinarily, it is the second narrative that is by far the more burdensome or threatening in that it throws into ques- tion one's ability to regulate and understand one's own conduct. To continue with my review, I have been emphasizing that the origin of many of the disclaimers we use is to be found partly in the infantile, "bodily ego" or sensorimotor antecedents of thinking in words.5 What distinguishes this infantile mode is its concretized and</page><page sequence="11">ACTION AND NARRATION IN PSYCHOANALYSIS animistic rendition of psychological activity, according to which it consists of the movements of substances and energies through physi- cal space. "I don't know what's gotten into me" is one of the locutions that indicates the formative influence of the "bodily ego" on our ordi- nary notions of mind, personality, motivation, and action. As body- centered beings, we corporealize our mental actions from the first; the learning of ordinary figurative language facilitates and consoli- dates this apparently unavoidable way of constructing experience. In this connection Freud referred to "spitting out" as the infantile pro- totype of negative judgments.6 Among the instances of this corporealization that deserve special attention are the so-called mechanisms of defense.7 Each of these defensive actions has one or more bodily referents. For example, Freud pointed out that the mechanism of isolation commonly refers to preventing objects from touching dangerously.8 Similarly, projec- tion is commonly taken to refer to physical expulsion of noxious emotion-substances. Another such instance of corporealization is the spatial narrative of mind in terms of internalization and the many variations and correlates of that word, such as inner world, internal objects, and external reality.9 Throughout these earlier writings I have indicated that people are fantasizing whenever they disclaim action. That is to say, they are imagining their selves or their minds as spatial entities existing in a split up and split off way. And I have also indicated, in connection with both the psychoanalytic life history and the multiple visions of reality, that it is more illuminating to approach these acts of imagining as narratives or tellings that constitute experience than as reports of some independently constituted, introspectible experience.10 Introspection-looking within the mind-is itself a spatial account of mental activity; this account is optional rather than mandatory. I want now to go on to show in more detail how disclaiming is a narrative action and how in each case the narrative being composed and the subjective world being constituted may be inferred from the analysand's language and its context." In order to deal adequately with these topics, however, it will be necessary first to take up briefly the charge of literalism that has been directed against my proposal of action language as a new language for psychoanalysis.12 (This criticism may have already troubled some of you.) It is an important charge in that it raises fundamental questions about what is conveyed by language in general and where the analyst stands in relation to language. According to this charge, as I under- stand it, in my critical use of action language I am ignoring the fact that people use metaphors knowingly when thinking and speaking, 71</page><page sequence="12">NEW LITERARY HISTORY and I am making too much of conventional speech acts. For example, when a man says, "I am crushed by this defeat," he knows, so the argument goes, that he is not literally crushed; he is merely using a manner of speaking. But, I would say in response, in one way or another people do act "crushed" when they say genuinely that that's how they feel; otherwise in most cases we would not know how to take their saying so. They slump physically, lower their voices, behave in a listless or dazed manner, etc. Certainly that man would confuse us or would appear to be dissembling or histrionic if, while saying he is crushed, he were to carry himself proudly and speak authoritatively. Suppose that this defeated man were to dream anxiously of a great stone falling on him; or suppose that he were to carry on in a curi- ously fragmented, uncoordinated way in both his physical and cogni- tive actions: given the expectable sorts of associations to these phenomena, an analyst might well surmise, as a partial explanation or retelling of them, that the analysand did indeed believe he had been crushed, which is to say that having been crushed was somehow psychically real for him. (In each case it would be desirable to eluci- date the significance of being "crushed," such as having been punished for wanting to mix into the tangle of bodies in the primal scene.) The point of my rejoinder, then, is this: the psychoanalytic listener must always listen literally in order to develop specifically psychoana- lytic interpretations. Psychoanalysts say that, unconsciously, one al- ways takes things literally, whether one has consciously decided to do so or not; in working as an analyst, however, one decides to do so deliberately. Freud's studies of dreams, free associations, errors, jokes, and symptoms amply established the heuristic benefits of this literalism, this going on as though there could be no purely figurative speech. Divorcing language from the concreteness of "the Uncon- scious" would be fatal to the psychoanalytic enterprise. At the same time, of course, the analyst must listen to the ordered, communicative, adaptive aspects of figurative language; in other words, he or she must take into account the relative autonomy and conventionalization of this language. There is no contradiction in saying that the analyst simultaneously listens in more than one way. In the interest of developing specifically psychoanalytic accounts of action and thereby maximizing in this special way the intelligibility of otherwise puzzling or obscure phenomena, the psychoanalyst pre- supposes that there is a second reality.13 This is the reality of uncon- scious mental processes, and it is characterized by modes and contents of a special sort (about which, more later). To speak of this second reality is to restate the basic psychoanalytic assumption systematically 72</page><page sequence="13">ACTION AND NARRATION IN PSYCHOANALYSIS set forth by Freud in his paper "The Unconscious" and never ques- tioned by him thereafter: that there is a concrete, magical, illogical mode of unconscious activity which plays a part, however variable, in all the ways that people constitute their lives.14 And to put this point yet another way, the distinction we draw between dream-thinking and thinking while awake is only relative; these two forms of thinking are not mutually exclusive. Described in the psychoanalytic way, we con- tinue in part to dream while awake, so that our waking construction of experience can only be fully understood psychoanalytically by draw- ing on Freud's dream psychology.15 Consequently, an analyst should welcome rather than reject the charge of literalism, for that charge may be taken as a statement that he or she is remaining psychoanalytic. In my own case, my attitude is equally welcoming when the charge of literalism is directed against my theoretical critique of Freud's metapsychological concepts. From the standpoint of action language, these concepts implement somatic-mechanistic-anthropomorphic narrative strategies which, far from satisfactorily explaining things psychoanalytically, themselves require psychoanalytic explanation. A structure, a mechanism, a mental apparatus, a discharge of energy, an automatization, or an internalization: these and other such metapsychological terms evi- dence the importing of blatantly corporealized fantasy content into psychoanalytic theory. Elsewhere I have tried to show how this is so, while at the same time recognizing and appreciating, as others have done, the historical-scientific grounds on which Freud usefully began, more than eighty years ago, to employ these narrative strategies to develop his account of psychoanalysis on the model of the laboratory sciences of his day.16 In its being relatively demetaphorized, action language is beset by fewer of the problems that beset metapsychology in this regard and so may serve as a desirable systematic alternative to it. It is not being advocated that action language be the enforced and exclusive or even pervasive language of the clinical dialogue. It would be fatal to clinical exploration and effectiveness to do clinical work in that way. A keen recognition of disclaimers is, however, technically useful, especially in analyzing resistances.17 I should say, resisting. And no matter what form the clinical dialogue has taken, any account of personal change and insight achieved through psychoanalysis must give a prominent place to an increase in the range and comfort of consciously acknowledged agency and responsibility on the part of the analysand.18 Returning now to the fantasizing or narrative actions implicit in disclaiming, I shall first assemble and state one generalized disclaimer 73</page><page sequence="14">NEW LITERARY HISTORY and then illustrate it with some of the more or less common locutions that convey and implement it. The generalized disclaimer is this: I inhabit a world of autonomously acting mental entities. These entities include thoughts, feelings, desires, atti- tudes, impulses, prohibitions, and judgments. They act on me or on one an- other, and these actions take place in me or around me in space. The actions of these entities is more evident at some times than others. They cause my suffering and my gratifications. At best they are only sometimes or partly subject to my influence or control. Examples: I couldn't seem to shake off the sad feeling about my childhood. The thought of revenge suggests itself. My anticipation of today didn't let me go to sleep. The sadistic fantasy came between me and my climax. The dream stayed with me all day. The idea of the hopelessness of our relationship washed away the good feeling about you. The thought of the weekend took over. Bad feelings about you came up suddenly. The edge of a doubt began to intrude itself. I can't escape the feeling that it won't work. What sort of world is being made in these condensed narratives? Certainly it is very physical and animistic. It is full of surprises, many of them bewildering if not ominous. It is so densely populated that to be alone with one's thoughts is not to be alone at all. In these instances what Hamlet called "the pale cast of thought" does not adequately describe the experience of thinking. The world presented through disclaimed action is a hectic, often unmanageable world. This is so even when, as is often the case, the subjective self is portrayed either as a poised master of its fate or as a detached, passive, perhaps help- less witness of psychological events that are taking place. For whether they are mastered or suffered, the events in question are being pre- sented in ways appropriate to a tightly run ship, a bloody arena, a blooming garden, a fantastic theater, a turbulent or tranquil beach, or a raging battlefield. Viewed as narratives, these locutions do not seem to describe the personal life of a unitary, fully responsible agent. How different the world seems when the mental actions just cited are being claimed by the analysand rather than disclaimed. Examples: I continued to review my situation sadly no matter how much I thought I wanted to conceive of it in other ways. (In this version there are no sad feelings to shake off.) 74</page><page sequence="15">ACTION AND NARRATION IN PSYCHOANALYSIS Just now I thought the word revenge, and I do not see its relevance to what I've been saying. Alternatively: I wish to take revenge! (In either case, there are no autonomous thoughts suggesting themselves.) I kept on anticipating today so excitedly (apprehensively, eagerly) that I never did relax enough to go to sleep. (Now no independent power is being attributed to anticipations.) I delayed and attenuated my climax by imagining sadistic situations. (No longer is there a rude intrusion by self-motivating fantasies.) All day I continued to think about what I had dreamed. (Thoughts that stick or cling are not part of this narrative.) I was thinking of you affectionately until I realized once again that I could not hope to have a relationship with you. (The account no longer depends on liquefaction of the modes of emotion.) Once I began to think of the weekend, I thought of nothing else. (Personal authority is not now being usurped by thought-entities.) Suddenly and surprisingly I do not like you, and I dread saying so directly. (Here buried thought-entities are not erupting.) I am beginning to doubt the truth of what I just said. (The subject attributes no spatial extension and motion to thoughts.) I continue to think that it won't work, and I wish I didn't think of it in that dismal way. (The speaker is not now beset by implicitly persecutory feelings.) These action locutions establish the analysand as a single or unitary and fully responsible, even if conflicted and puzzled, agent. Now the analysand is someone who is acting as a person in a world made up of other people who are also agents. Gone is the populous, animistic "inner world," and gone is the posture of either a commander or a detached, passive, helpless witness of dramatized psychological events. One might say that the analysand is more fully awake; alter- natively, one might say that he or she is doing less dreaming while awake or at least is not emphasizing as much as before the dreamlike aspects of psychological activity or the second reality it implies. Now the analysand is not so much harassed by mental life as engaged in clarifying, extending, and communicating the complex, uncertain, distressed, or pleasurable aspects of his or her activity. In one way, not having fragmented and distributed himself or herself in an "inner world" narrative, the person as agent is more alone; in another way, having maintained personal agency, he or she is at least potentially involved in intersubjective or social relationships and communication. In this connection it should be recalled that Freud emphasized the neurotic's retreat to fantasy, and that he called the neurotic asocial even if still, unlike the schizophrenic, fundamentally object (person)-related.19 Disclaimed action is asocial action in Freud's sense. Not that the use of disclaimers should be equated with neurosis; as I said, we all use this language and often use it adaptively. But in func- tioning neurotically, one is, among other things, likely to be depend- 75</page><page sequence="16">NEW LITERARY HISTORY ing excessively or desperately on the defensive use of disclaimers in critical life situations. In other respects, such as presenting oneself grandiosely or as neurotically guilty, one is depending excessively on irrational claiming of action-but that is another whole chapter of psychoanalysis that I shall not review at this time. III. Self-Reflexive Narrations Constructing narratives in psychoanalysis is not limited to inventing or repeating disclaimers and excessive claims of action. It should not be going too far to assert that for the analyst it is profitable to regard any act of thinking and speaking as an instance of narration and, on the basis of this claim, to propose that one aspect of learning language is learning which tales to use in organizing action (knowing what you are doing) and which tales to tell about actions already performed or else encountered (knowing what others are doing). That is, one learns not only how to compose and use these tales, but, more fatefully, how to act so as to be able to give a coherent and continuous account of one's activities. At least superficially, this account will be comprehen- sible and useful under one or another set of circumstances. One learns how to construct experience. In this view, language is a set of instructions for narratively constituting events, and the narrative constituting of these events is a uniquely and pervasively human form of action. As narratives concerning the self make up a large portion of these analytic tales, and as the self figures ever more prominently in clinical and theoretical discourse, it should be useful to analyze further these self-narrations.20 To begin with a clinical example: A male analysand is telling of having wanted to flirt with a married female colleague. He adds, "I didn't give in to myself." In this rendition he is giving a two-person narrative account of what, in action terms, could be presented as his having decided on a course of action that he did not altogether want to undertake. In his narrative, one person, with whom he consciously identifies, is insisting that he adhere to certain standards that he has set, while the other person is trying to overcome this opposition by insisting that the flirtatious course of action be undertaken. Although the analysand refers to the second person as "myself," he nevertheless maintains the vantage point of the first person, and he disapproves of this second or other self. In portraying the action as, in effect, going on between two people in opposition to one another, he is engaged in 76</page><page sequence="17">ACTION AND NARRATION IN PSYCHOANALYSIS constructing experience on the basis of what some psychoanalysts have called "splitting" of the self-representation. Another form of narrative splitting, in which disclaiming is still obvious, would go this way: "I overcame the impulse to flirt with her." Other such forms of disclaiming would be, "I controlled myself" and "I resisted the temptation." No splitting would be conveyed in a pure action statement of the following sort: "I wanted to flirt with her very much and was about to do so, but I decided it wouldn't be the right way to act and so I refrained from acting that way-reluctantly." Of course, we do not ordinarily compose pure action narratives of any length (nor do I imply that we should). Sooner or later we are likely to introduce figurative and disclaiming language into any action-oriented narration; then, for example, we might say, "I told myself it wouldn't be the right way to act," "I made up my mind not to do it," "I wouldn't like myself for it," or, resorting to quantitative figures of speech, "I held off with all my might." But that we do resort to these locutions only shows how much we rely on disclaiming forms of narration. Potentially, one always has the option of employing other narrative modes. In this respect, Nelson Goodman has spoken of "ways of worldmaking."21 The use of reflexive self-narratives is one way of worldmaking. An essential feature of analytic insight is the increas- ingly limited use of self-narrations of the sort that amount to flagrant disclaimers; at least this use is limited in critical situations, those which may have fateful consequences for the person, that is, the narrator. There is a large stock of self-reflexive terms in which the person implicitly portrays himself or herself as subject and object simulta- neously. In these instances, Freud said, the ego most obviously takes itself as object or perhaps is taken as object by the observing superego. These self-reflexive terms include self-control, self-love, self-hatred, self-indulgence, self-pity, self-searching, and self-destruction. Cer- tainly one may simply take these terms in the way that has become traditional, that is, as representing a form of thought, namely the self-reflexive form; it should be noted, however, that this usage has become traditional only over the past few centuries.22 Or one may take the logical line that any notion of a self necessarily implies both self as subject and self as object. I am proposing that one may usefully take these terms differently, that is, as condensed narratives. One's war- rant for doing so would be that in each instance it is possible to engage in and tell about the activity in question in some other way; for, as I indicated, there are nonreflexive ways in which to portray actions of this sort and thus to construct and communicate experience. One of these ways preceded the narrative language of the self by many cen- 77</page><page sequence="18">NEW LITERARY HISTORY turies. In this way it is visitation by pagan or Christian deities: it is the god of War or Love, the protecting angel or tempting devil who is the other agent in the transaction rather than (or in addition to) the subject-self or the object-self. Except in unusual circumstances, these narrations are no longer widely used by educated persons. My recommended alternative to the self-narrative approach is the utilization of action language. I recommend it for theoretical purposes. This approach is commonly used in an unsystematic or intermittent way in everyday discourse. One says, for example, "I wish I had thought of that" and "I regret my having yelled at him." But in order to clarify further the issues raised in this connection, let us consider one self-reflexive term, self-indulgence; and for the sake of clarity and specificity, let us refer only to the manifest form of self- indulgence usually called overeating. How might one tell of this activ- ity in action terms rather than the reflexive terms of self-narration? One might say, "I ate excessively according to the standards I main- tain regarding quantity, and I contemplate what I did regretfully and contemptuously." (The standards being referred to might just as well pertain to expense, occasion, manner of eating, etc., and the con- templating might be done guiltily or anxiously or in some other emo- tional way; however, as none of these variations of content would affect the form of the narrative, they may be ignored for present purposes.) In this action version of self-indulgence, rather than two selves being at odds with one another or at least interacting with one another, there is a single agent performing and considering certain of his or her actions in different, more or less incompatible ways, which is to say performing them, and perhaps consciously considering them, conflictually. By narrating self-indulgence in action language, one will confront the paradox that one is violating the very standards or ideals that he or she is applying at that very moment. What we call standards or ideals may be stated as actions. A standard or ideal refers to an agent's applying a set of criteria to an action; it has no force of its own. A standard or ideal is a way we use to measure performances against criteria of excellence or perfection. Contrary to Freud, the tale of an Ego Ideal or Superego measuring the ego, judging it, and shaming or punishing it, as though it were another forceful person or another person's forceful will-this tale need not be told by a psychoanalyst in his or her theoretical formulations. Finally, it must be emphasized that, according to the approach being developed here, self-reflexive narratives are not composed only subsequent to actions. Narration covers more than what has already been enacted. The actions come into being in narrative form or at 78</page><page sequence="19">ACTION AND NARRATION IN PSYCHOANALYSIS least in narratable form, and that form is almost infinitely changeable. The analyst may retell a significant action, such as overeating, in many ways before the analysis is considered reasonably thorough (e.g., as nursing greedily, as retreating from heterosexuality, and as punish- ment of self and others). IV. Talking "About" Something as a Defensive and Controlling Action If narration constitutes experience, then it, too, must always be regarded as a present action. Conventionally, however, narratives are thought to be "about" some actions or events other than themselves that have already taken place; they are said to refer to something else that is otherwise knowable. Narration has been defined "most mini- mally as verbal acts consisting of someone telling someone else that some- thing happened."23 For example, one may tell about one's last trip abroad or about a dream or memory. The story of narration is, how- ever, more complex than this. Analysands often raise the question, "What should I talk about?" or they demand, "Tell me what to talk about," or they announce, "I have nothing to talk about," or they come in with an agenda of "things to talk about," such as the events that took place over the weekend or a dream of the night before. Talking "about" something may be regarded as a specialized form of telling. It is a present action by which one deliberately and explicitly encourages the listener to expect to hear just a story of some kind. By establishing this narrative atmosphere, one attempts to define and thus also to limit what will be experienced. One is giving instructions, much as authors do in the way they tell a story, if not in their explicit authorial pronouncements. For instance, the analysand may be estab- lishing a detached position as chronicler of events; the analysand may be implicitly flouting the free-association rule; or he or she may be attempting to limit the analyst's attention to some presumably pure content whose only context exists outside the consulting room. Un- consciously or preconsciously, however, the analysand may be under- stood to be making such statements as these: "I am afraid to fall silent and thereby enrage you," "I am afraid to be alone with you," or "I am afraid that I will be shocked and mortified by what I unexpectedly think." Although for technical reasons the analyst may decide not to intervene in this regard, he or she cannot listen to what is being told purely as story-content. The analyst's highest priority must be to at- 79</page><page sequence="20">NEW LITERARY HISTORY tempt to understand in a psychoanalytic fashion the construction and communication of experience in the here and now of the analytic session. To achieve this understanding, the analyst must attend to the analysand's selection and arrangement of what to talk "about," the context and timing of this move in the discourse, the style or manner in which the telling is performed, the past and present subjective situations that may be inferred from this performance, and other such matters. Of course, the allegedly pure story-content may itself be treated as a valuable source of information about the here and now, as when what is being related is taken to be a piece of obvious acting-out (the alternative to acknowledged remembering) or when an ostensible memory that just "came to mind" is taken to be a further elaboration of the current phase of the transference (e.g., suddenly remembering how intrusive one's mother was just at the point when it seems that one dares not think consciously that this is how the analyst is being experienced). Further, the analysand's account of what he or she is talking "about" must be regarded as merely one version of the story-content to which reference is being made. There are so many ways in which one can tell "about," say, a tennis match, an escapade, or an argument with one's spouse. Each account presents a more or less different event. There is no one, final, true, all-purpose account of that event. Synonymity exists only under very special circumstances. As analyst, one wants to redescribe psychoanalytically the point of the specific story-content's having been introduced in the way that it was; in other words, one wants to formulate psychoanalytically the implicit question to which that story-content is an answer, the wishful and defensive course of action of which it is the compromised representative, the doubting it is intended to bring to an end, or the topic it is meant to exclude. In daily life and for practical purposes, we accept paraphrases as referring to one and the same event; we proceed as though these paraphrases converge on one definitive account of the event in ques- tion, that is, as though synonymity is not to be questioned. Minor variations do not matter; we just know what is being told. Although in one's role as analyst one does often follow this practical course of action, too, one does so provisionally, that is, only so long as one detects no indications that the account being given by the analysand should be examined psychoanalytically as an account of a certain sort rather than as a transparent vehicle of the analysand's saying anything at all. The analysand's question, "What shall I talk about?" is an indi- cation that transparency is not to be assumed. This is so because the 80</page><page sequence="21">ACTION AND NARRATION IN PSYCHOANALYSIS rule of free association calls only for talking; essentially, it does not recognize talking "about." In the ideal form of free-associating, one will say, "I think of what happened at work yesterday"; one will not say, "I'm going to talk about what happened at work yesterday," for in this latter case, one may be taken to be conveying a conscious plan, a deliberate selection, an imagined distancing of oneself from the content, and other mes- sages of that sort mentioned earlier in this section. Analysands do not, of course, consistently free-associate in the way I just mentioned, but far from failing as analysands in this respect, they may be taken to be indicating where their problems lie and in what these problems con- sist. In the psychoanalytic retelling, there is no right and wrong in free-associating. It is in this sense that resisting is not fundamentally unanalytic or antianalytic; it is further material to be interpreted or retold analytically (e.g., silence as an enactment of constipation or of triumph over the analyst's confidence, authority, phallus, or breast). Insofar as telling "about" something deliberately, even if uncon- sciously, establishes a conventional narrative atmosphere, it tends to put the analyst in the role of audience or archivist and inactivates him or her (or so it is hoped) as analyst. It becomes plain that this is the intended effect when the analyst is made to feel hesitant to interrupt the account before it has been "ended" or when the analysand com- plains of having been interrupted or insists on getting to "the end" before (if ever) reporting thoughts and feelings that have "come to mind" during the narration. Further, even when the ostensible free- associating has been designed to be an uninterruptible narrative, it is anyway usually interrupted privately by the analysand, who will, for example, think things over while telling his or her tale or will notice but pass over emotional constituents of the telling. The analysand's insisting on going on with the narrative and deleting this allegedly extraneous material in the interest of remaining coherent, consecu- tive, and complete is, in this respect, usually a defensive action. Strictly speaking, free-associating cannot be said to be interrupted by analyst or analysand, for by definition it has no beginning or end. For the analyst, both the beginning and the ending of free-associating coin- cide with the beginning and ending of each analytic session. Mention should be made here of Wittgenstein's comment in this regard: he noted a self-contradiction in Freud's account of the free- association method in that, by definition and contrary to Freud, there is no way to determine the end of a chain of free-associations.24 I have tried to meet Wittgenstein's criticism elsewhere by putting the ques- tion of end points in the perspective of the complex circular and 81</page><page sequence="22">NEW LITERARY HISTORY configurational ways in which analysts actually listen to and use the associations.25 Analysands do, of course, get to do productive, more or less freely associative work between analytic sessions, and then they may come to their sessions with analytic material to talk "about." The analyst, however, deals only with those accounts of this continuing work that are given in subsequent sessions, and he or she takes them as narra- tives to be considered as actions that it might be fruitful to analyze further. These supplementary accounts may, for example, be more "revealing" than what was told within previous sessions; they may be presented in a self-effacing or competitive manner or in a way that is intended to prove that the analyst is not needed. None of which is to deny that this self-analytic work may not also advance the analysis appreciably. As I mentioned, some analysands regularly come to their analytic sessions with an opening topic that they have selected to talk "about." It may be a report of the events of the day, a description of the mood they've been in, a rehearsed dream, etc. One defensive function served by this entrance is to avoid narratively experiencing the open- ing of the session itself-how it felt to come in and rejoin the analyst, how the analyst looked, what would just "come to mind." A similar function is served by silent or conspicuous preparation for the end of the session-e.g., choosing not to say certain things because there is not enough time to talk "about" them. Often, entrances and exits of this sort may be viewed usefully as unconsciously contrived enact- ments. For example, they may be said to enact anal orderliness or omnipotent narcissistic control; for to flounder, blurt out things, or "be sent away abruptly" may signify to the analysand humiliating incontinence as well as angering rejection. Although it is often clini- cally appropriate to defer confronting the analysand with the appar- ent significance of this sort of talking or not talking "about," one may always approach it as a controlling action within the transference: specifically, it may be taken to be a defensive escape from the trans- ference and the as yet consciously unknown "self" who, one fears, might emerge if one were to engage the analyst more directly and spontaneously as a coagent in the here and now of the analysis. V. Conclusion: The Second Reality What has been presented here amounts to a hermeneutic version of psychoanalysis. In this version, psychoanalysis is an interpretive disci- pline rather than a natural science. It deals in language and equiva- 82</page><page sequence="23">ACTION AND NARRATION IN PSYCHOANALYSIS lents of language. Interpretations are redescriptions or retellings of action along the lines peculiar to psychoanalytic interest. Action can only be named or described from one or another point of view, that is, on the basis of certain presuppositions and in keeping with certain aims. The analyst examines the presuppositions and aims of the analysand's narratives, which is to say, the rules the analysand is fol- lowing in free-associating or resisting free-associating. But the analyst does not define these rules in a way that is theory-free and method- free. A simple positivistic conception of analytic work is inadequate, for there is no sharp split between subject and object. The facts are what the analyst makes them out to be; they are a function of the specifically psychoanalytic questions that guide this narrational pro- ject, and these questions implement the narrative strategies that are favored by the analyst's own presuppositions, however unsys- tematized these might be. On this account, only a radically relativistic conception of psychoanalysis will do. No stand may be taken on a single reality to be arrived at by purely objective analysis. Accordingly, the criteria of validity of psychoanalytic interpretation are those of coherence, con- sistency, comprehensiveness, and ultimately, conformity with refined common sense. Refined common sense has always sanctioned in- terpretation of unconscious motives, emotions, wishes, and fantasies, as well as the influence of early experience on later action.26 It recog- nizes that no person is always the best witness of the intent or signifi- cance of his or her own actions; it also recognizes that anyone may be expected to contest vehemently certain redescriptions of his or her actions (e.g., envy or insensitivity) that others will easily and unani- mously accept as valid. Additionally, refined common sense also rec- ognizes symbols of sex and aggression in their various forms; these symbols are recognized to pervade jokes, slang, art, and myth. Within the approach being used, interpretations may be accepted as valid or retellings may be accepted as indispensable when they can withstand further tough questions that have been generated in keeping with this same approach. In saying there is no single knowable reality as a final test of truth, one establishes a basis for characterizing psychoanalysis as a narrative method for constructing a second reality.27 This second reality is or- ganized largely in the terms of what Freud called unconscious mental processes, which he described as timeless, concrete, magical, tolerant of contradictions, etc. Analysts speak in this regard of psychic reality or unconscious fantasy. But so long as appropriate criteria of descrip- tion are being applied systematically, this reality is as real as any other reality. Although this second reality sometimes overlaps the ordinary, 83</page><page sequence="24">NEW LITERARY HISTORY conscious, rational, or pragmatic reality of everyday life, it need not do so, and in crucial respects it does not do so. In many ways, the second reality of psychoanalysis is more akin to the reality constructed in poetry, story, visual arts, and myth. It both supplements and com- petes with pragmatic conventionalized reality. Both kinds of reality are constructions. Each construction has its uses. In hermeneutic fashion, the foregoing schematic remarks on nar- ration, actions, and reality serve simultaneously as a guide for under- standing psychoanalysis and as the version of psychoanalysis one may develop on the basis of this understanding.

This is so because insurance coverage is conceived within the framework of conventional law and conventional definitions of responsibility in terms of conscious knowledge, volition, reflection, and practices. Different conceptions of neurosis come into being for different purposes. Consequently, my discussion should not lead to economic disaster for analysts and their insured analysands. 3 See, for example, Wayne Booth, The Rhetoric of Fiction (Chicago, 1961). 4 See my New Language for Psychoanalysis and Language and Insight. 5 Sigmund Freud, "The Ego and the Id" (1923), The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud, ed.
