<plain_text><page sequence="1">Yeats, Fairies, and the New Animism Sinead Garrigan Mattar The slogan for our times then is, not things fall apart, but things come alive —W.J. T. Mitchell Max Beerbohm's famous 1904 cartoon of "Mr. W. B. Yeats presenting Mr. George Moore to the Queen of the Fairies" is only an early distillation of the ridicule Yeats's investment in fairy lore has often invited.1 By concentrating on the formal dynamics of Yeats's "Celtic Twilight" poetry, some critics have sidestepped the embarrassment of his beliefs about fairies altogether,2 whilst others have employed nuanced understandings of both the occult revivals of the 1890s and the function of fairy lore in rural Ireland to create a historicist critique that can address his enthusiasm without seeming to succumb to it.3 Those who have actively defended Yeats have done so largely by assimilating his credulity towards the fairies into the bigger picture of his evolving and multifaceted occultism: seen in tandem with his interests in esoteric mysticism, spiritualism, and Eastern religions, and with the development of the arcane system outlined in A Vision, his early investment in the fairies looks to be part of a grander (and, to some, a more plausible) antimaterialist, Neoplatonic philosophy.4 But none of these approaches comes near to grasping the radicalism of Yeats's attitudes. Recent developments in social theory bring that radicalism into a new focus and suggest that Yeats's particular approach to the fairies demands both reassessment and renewed interest. It is in regards to the concept of "animism" that contemporary theo ries (from across the disciplines of anthropology, psychology, theology, sociology, and philosophy of science) find a touchpoint with Yeats's fairy lore. In the "Compositionist Manifesto" he published in New Liter ary History in Summer 2010, and in challenging the "bifurcation" of human consciousness and "nature" after the "epistemological break" of the Enlightenment, Bruno Latour suggested that "there is no way to devise a successor to nature, if we do not tackle the tricky question of animism anew."5 At the end of the nineteenth century, Yeats too was engaged in reassessing the tricky question of animism by challenging New Literary History, 2012, 43: 137—157</page><page sequence="2">138 NEW LITERARY HISTORY contemporary anthropological negotiations of the concept that were (as Latour diagnoses now, and as Yeats realized then) the product of a post-Enlightenment, anthropocentric insistence on the primary "ma terialism" of the cosmos. Of course, Yeats's contexts were literary and occult, where Latour and his contemporaries work within or through the parameters of social science. Moreover, the openness to a relational view of the pluriverse that we find in Yeats's early folklore and poetry cannot be found as readily in the more arcane and hieratic voice of his later writing. Yet there is a remarkable consonance between Yeats's vi sion of fairy-human-environmental relations in the 1880s and 1890s and the recent redefinition of "animism" by social scientists. Finally, because they are so indebted to Victorian anthropology, a proper analysis of, first, Yeats's writings on world belief-systems acknowledged as animistic and, secondly, his Irish fairy lore reveals something new about the rela tionship between the materialist narratives of nineteenth-century social science and the concurrent, related "re-enchantment" of the world by nineteenth- and early twentieth-century litterateurs. If at first it seems only idiosyncratic that Yeats should use science contra science in his fairy lore, in the end it seems significant of some forgotten but endur ing aspect of that science that he did so. It is worth remembering that the word "animism" was coined by Edward Tylor in his foundational study of 1871, Primitive Culture, to describe the first stage in the development of religious thought: the stage at which "naturalism," an entirely materialist understanding of the world, was superseded by a stage in which souls and spirits were considered to play a part in the functioning of life.6 Out of animism was supposed to grow religion proper, ultimately itself to be superseded by scientific rationalism. Primitive Culture was a text that was grounded in the idea that culture, like biology, evolved (PCi 1-2), and that certain cultures (Western ones) had evolved further than others. It depended implicitly on "the myth of progress." Tylor wrote, "The educated world of Europe and America practically settles a standard by simply placing its own nations at one end of the social series and savage tribes at the other, arranging the rest of mankind between these limits according as they correspond more closely to savage or to cultured life. . . . Few would dispute that the following races are arranged rightly in order of culture: - Australian, Tahitian, Aztec, Chinese, Italian" (PCi 23-24). The workings of this "social series" implicitly valorized imperialism, since "elevation is much more apt to be produced by foreign than by native action" (PCi 48). Animism, as Tylor defined it, was a savage stage of development, the very purpose of which was to be outgrown, and for this reason twentieth-century anthropologists were justifiably uneasy with</page><page sequence="3">YEATS, FAIRIES, AND THE NEW ANIMISM 139 the word, although it remained a part of the discipline's descriptive vo cabulary.7 But since the 1990s the term has been undergoing revision and revival: Philippe Descola, Nurit Bird-David, Eduardo Viveiros de Castro, Tim Ingold, and now Latour have built on the work of forerunners such as Marilyn Strathern to redefine a series of comparable worldviews, and their thinking has been popularized as "the new animism."8 Theirs is a renegotiated understanding of relations within an animated pluriverse that carries the name "animism" without its stigma of belatedness. The crucial point for all is, as Bird-David enunciated in 1999, that animism should be seen as a "relational (not a failed) epistemology."9 The "failure" of animistic ontologies, according to the rationalist and materialist standards of Victorian anthropology, was not simply determined by the evolutionism of Tylorian thought but also (and as Latour correctly indicates) by its dualistic (one might say, Cartesian10) basis. Tylor's definition of animism depended upon the argument that, in the first throes of the animistic stage of development, primitive peo ples assumed by analogy that just as they had "separable souls," which seemed to leave their bodies temporarily in sleep and permanendy in death, so things in the natural world must be likewise animated. Out of this first leap of (mistaken) rational thought grew their sense that the world beyond them operated with a will akin to their own. Edward Tylor, Andrew Lang, James Frazer, and their contemporaries argued that this idea was reflected in the mythology, folklore, and belief that sprang from this period of development and lingered on into the "adulthood" of the world as a series of "survivals" (PCi 15, also chapters 3 &amp; 4 passim). The basis of animism, in this understanding, was anthropocentric, cerebral, and analogical—if delusive (PCi 20-21). Not only did the subjectivism of this view spring from the "epistemological break" of the seventeenth/ eighteenth centuries, but also the argument that a process of analogy was the basis for animistic belief: Andrew Lang, in Myth, Ritual, and Religion, cited Hume's dictum that "There is an universal tendency in mankind to conceive all beings like themselves, and to transfer to every object those qualities ... of which they are intimately conscious"11 to justify the Tylorian hypothesis. This dualistic conceptual framework, modern anthropologists insist, was incapable of grasping the bases of animistic ontologies, which oper ate, rather, according to a subject-subject or "relational" pattern. This is how Tim Ingold defines the issues at stake: According to a long-established convention [i.e., after Tylor], animism is a system of beliefs that imputes life or spirit to things that are truly inert. But this conven tion ... is misleading .... First, we are dealing here not with a way of believing</page><page sequence="4">140 NEW LITERARY HISTORY about the world but with a condition of being in it. This could be described as a condition of being alive to the world, characterised by a heightened sensitivity and responsiveness, in perception and action, to an environment that is always in flux, never the same from one moment to the next. Animacy, then, is not a property of persons imaginatively projected onto the things with which they perceive themselves to be surrounded. Rather ... it is the dynamic, transforma tive potential of the entire field of relations within which beings of all kinds, more or less person-like or thing-like, continually and reciprocally bring one another into existence. The animacy of the lifeworld, in short, is not the result of an infusion of spirit into substance, or of agency into materiality, bvit is rather ontologically prior to their differentiation. The obvious conclusion, for Ingold, is that Western science needs to admit its failings and to reinvent itself: "Re-animating the 'western' tradi tion of thought means recovering the sense of astonishment banished from official science,'n2 Ingold's description has much in common with authoritative views shared by other social scientists. Yet the inheritance the nineteenth century bequeathed to the twentieth was more complicated, less static, and less confined by the dualism of "official science" than such accounts would have one believe.13 W. B. Yeats, for one, saw the value of "ani mistic ontologies" in a way that is consonant with twenty-first century re-evaluations, but he did so, crucially, by plundering the rich resources that "official science" provided, even as he scorned its anthropocentric scientism: it is the richness and complexity of these resources that has been forgotten. What has not been forgotten is that the conception of "animism" that Tylorian anthropology developed (especially via James Frazer and An drew Lang) was strongly dependent upon the evidence of literature.14 So, as well as generating questions about the existence of spirits and the workings of the uncanny, it fed debates about perception and represen tation, analogy and metaphor, that were immediately transferable into an aesthetic mode and which (as we shall see) are strangely resonant with modern theorizations about animism. In a book that Yeats read and annotated, Andrew Lang diagnosed the "nebulous and confused" state of mind of the animistic savage by stating that "The savage draws no hard and fast line between himself and the things in the world," as part of an extended argument about the myths to which this state of mind gave rise: "The dead and the living, men, beasts, and gods, trees and stars, and rivers, and sun, and moon, dance through the region of myths in a burlesque ballet of Priapus, where everything may be any thing, where nature has no laws and imagination no limits."15 In one sense, Lang is here conforming absolutely to a Tylorian anthropology,</page><page sequence="5">YEATS, FAIRIES, AND THE NEW ANIMISM 141 in which the "savage" is the agent who interprets, or misinterprets, the world to which he feels connected, and his "imagination" is the force that animates it. But, in another sense, Lang is also passing beyond that orthodoxy, suggesting that, in fact, in Ingold's words, "'These peoples are united not in their beliefs but in a way of being that is alive and open to a world in continuous birth,"16 and that this is the stuff of poetry: a mythopoeia, beyond catachresis, analogy, and simile, but alive with ever-changing, enacted transformations. To say that the "savage draws no hard and fast line between himself and the things in the world" is not to limit the relationship between man and world to a one-way street of subject-object interpretation, especially given Lang's subsequent description of the an thropomorphic mythic world of both savage and Western culture—and Yeats (among others17) seems to have noticed this. In fact, it was precisely because Tylor and his followers were not solely interested in the single idea of the animistic as "the imputation of life to inert objects"ls that they provided such a wealth of material for writers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries to draw upon. Whatever the stated basis of his theory, Tylor's acceptation of "animism" was complex, wide-ranging, and inclusive: any "doctrine of souls," be it provided by ghost story, poetry, canon law, telepathic experience, or, indeed, "sav age" religious belief was a viable object of study—as the lengthy witness of Primitive Culture's second volume testifies. Yeats (among others) was able to plunder the storehouse of evidence that Tylor and his popular izers provided, even as he rejected the "materialist philosophy" upon which their discipline was founded. Just as Comtean positivism obliquely noted the value of "fetishism" even as it placed it at the lowest end of a developmental arch, so Tylorian cultural evolutionism made much of the animism it disparaged.19 The works that grew out of Tylor's vision, and especially those that pursued the questions of mythology and religion it raised, all added to the stockpile of evidence of an animism that was as vital an ingredient of poetry as it was of societal development. One of the most interesting pieces of writing Yeats produced in this context is a book review that has otherwise rather flummoxed his critics. John P. Frayne, the editor of Yeats's Uncollected Prose, comments that the article Yeats wrote in October 1893 about B. Douglas Howard's account of the Ainu of Sakhalin, Life with Trans-Siberian Savages,20 was "certainly Yeats's strangest reviewing assignment," but as an example of Yeats's in terest in global animistic traditions it is resonant with significance. Yeats is shrewdly critical of the book, but is won over by Howard's estimation of the "beautiful creed" he finds in Sakhalin as the "crown of all the Ainu life." In Yeats's gloss of Howard's findings, this animistic creed is not the product of a dualistic projection of self onto world, but rather it</page><page sequence="6">142 NEW LITERARY HISTORY takes the personhood and the godliness of all so-called objective realities as its first principal. Here is Yeats's precis of an account that is clearly described in such a way as to be conducive to his own mysticism: The savage looks upon naked eternity, while we unhappy triflers have built about us a wall of odds and ends. Mr. Howard's friends affirm one supreme god the maker of gods and men, but hold that he has under him innumerable minor divinities, such as the god of running waters, the god of lakes, the god of the sea, the god of the waters as a whole, and as the great goddess of the sun's fire, and the minor and mediatorial goddess of the household flame. There is an ancient Catholic writer who holds that "The Most High set the borders of the nations after the number of the angels of God." Are not fire and the waters more unchanging and mightier than any nations?21 The very first sentence is enough to suggest what is at issue here: the "wall of odds and ends" of a scientific age is an image of both a determinedly material and a scrappily inadequate construction, whereas "naked eternity" combines the physical and the abstract in a single phrase that affirms its connection with both realms even as it obfuscates it. Yeats's description is antirational in every respect, but his core point is one with which our contemporary anthropologists might agree: the Ainu's faith, as Yeats gives it to us, does not depend upon "an infusion of spirit into substance, or of agency into materiality, but is rather ontologically prior to their differentiation."22 The most radical part of the review, though, comes towards its conclu sion, when Yeats leaves off his reverie and turns a more critical gaze to the gritty political questions about representation that the book raises: "Mr. Howard tells all this so admirably and sympathetically that his conclud ing appeal to someone to go preach Christianity to his late subjects may excite surprise. . . . Should we not rather ask them to send us a tattooed and hairy missionary to help evangelise our own heathen?" (UPi 297) The vision of such a figure evangelizing in Bedford Park is titillating, but Yeats's instinctive outrage pre-echoes the theoretically-inflected an ger of more recent commentators. Writing about the West's battle with ontologies conceived as "other" in 2004, Latour argued emotively that historically "Westerners have not understood themselves as facing on the battlefield an enemy whose victory is possible, just irrational people who have to be corrected. . . . Westerners have until now been engaged in pedagogical wars. But things have changed of late and our wars are now wars of the worlds, because it's now the makeup of the cosmos that is at stake."23 For Yeats, animistic worldviews, such as that of the Ainu, were an object of fascination because "the makeup of the cosmos" was always what was at stake: let the Ainu do the teaching, he argued in 1893; let</page><page sequence="7">YEATS, FAIRIES, AND THE NEW ANIMISM 143 the pedagogical war be reversed. Yeats's own "postnaturalism" may have been driven by a Blakean belief in the primacy of spirit, but, ironically, it led to some of the same conclusions as those of the twenty-first-century inheritors of a more sceptical tradition. We often forget much about Yeats that should be remembered in this context. Yeats is too easily parodied (as in the Beerbohm cartoon) as an occultist who dabbled amidst the opportunities that the late nineteenth century generated for the spiritually disenfranchised Victorian: a victim of "Huxley and Tyndall" who, having been "deprived" of his childhood faith by evolutionary science,24 restlessly sought alternatives—amongst the fairies, amongst the Ainu. Yet, as I (and better scholars) have shown elsewhere, Yeats plundered the very science he decried, reading widely and comparatively. Although there is no evidence that he read Primitive Culture directly, Yeats read much that was influenced by it, leaping on John Rhys's "Hibbert Lectures" when they were published in 1888, read ing works by Lang, Alfred Nutt, Edward Clodd, and Frazer in the 1890s, entering into debate with members of the Folklore Society, and reviewing works of and on folklore that had assimilated modern anthropological and ethnographical ideas.25 The early 1890s were a period of intellectual expansion for Yeats and they are also the years in which his writings contain the greatest openness to multiple, unsystematized alternative ontologies: after this burgeoning period his margins become tighter. So, in assessing Howard's account of the Ainu, he mentions a work by "Isabella L. Bird," published in 1880 and called Unbeaten Tracks in Japan, as the only previous account of their animism. Howard's strength, for Yeats, is that he makes an attempt to adopt an "insider" perspective in Sakhalin, unlike Bird who remains always an "outsider" in her account of the Japanese Ainu (UPi 296). This incisive critical comment would not be remarkable if Howard had himself pointed to the Bird text, but Howard never mentions the book. Yeats's interest in the Ainu was clearly not limited to an arbitrary reviewing assignment: he knew about the subject from a range of sources. In 1893, with the publication of his three-volume edition of William Blake's work and its extraordinary, vicarious expression of his antimaterialist manifesto, with the appear ance of The Celtic Twilight, and with his commencement of a group of poems that were announced to be the first stirrings of The Wind Among the Reeds, all roads led to a realm in which spiritual and bodily forms existed with an equal and relational personhood, including the unbeaten tracks of Trans-Siberia. How Yeats came to know of Unbeaten Tracks in Japan is open to specula tion, but it seems possible that he sought it out, having seen it mentioned in a single footnote of another book that he also reviewed in 1893: T.F.</page><page sequence="8">144 NEW LITERARY HISTORY Thiselton Dyer's four-hundred-page account of miscellaneous spiritual phenomena, The Ghost World}6 Although Dyer's book is less valuable eth nographically than Howard's (being a collection of beliefs from around the world concerning everything from fairies to headless horsemen), it is more useful for determining precisely what the baby was that Yeats saw paddling in the bathwater of Victorian anthropology, since Dyer protests his (armchair) scientism repeatedly, and what comments he offers on the "ghost world" place him clearly in the camp of the "mate rialist philosopher." Edward Tylor himself is Dyer's chief authority for accounts of animistic custom from beyond the British Isles and, indeed, this book may well be the nearest Yeats came to a direct experience of Tylor's writings in the 1890s. Dyer quotes Tylor extensively and dutifully rehearses his theories about the evolution of animism and the varying forms it can take (as well as seeking evidences from Herbert Spencer, John Lubbock, Clodd, Lang, and Frazer). Where for Yeats, Howard's fault was his Eurocentricism, Dyer's is his rationalism, and in his review Yeats goes so far as to claim that the latter's "scientific" bias leads to a total philistinism: The outside of the book is far from comely to look at, and the inside is that mix ture of ancient beauty and modern commonplace one has got used to in books by scientific folk-lorists. Mr. Dyer collects numbers of the most entirely lovely and sacred, or tragic and terrible, beliefs in the world, and sets them side by side, transfixed with diverse irrelevancies—in much the same fashion that boys stick moths and butterflies side by side upon a door, with long pins in their bodies. At other times he irritates by being hopelessly inadequate, as when he follows a story of priceless beauty with the remark that "these folktales are interesting as embodying the superstitions of the people among whom they are current." But then no one expects the scientific folk-lorist to have a tongue of music, and this one gives us a great deal less of himself than the bulk of his tribe. (UPi 285) That Yeats objects to the lack of poetry and the fatuousness of judgment that the book contains is not surprising: throughout the late 1880s and 1890s he persistently objected to the soullessness of the "scientific folk lorist's" world.27 The value of folklore to Yeats was not as a specimen or a "survival" of savage culture, but as a continually revivifying source. The manner in which Yeats reverses the terms of ethnographic study, here, and sees the scientist as a "tribesman" is also typical of his particular irony in this context. What is more unusual, though, is the counterclaim Yeats's article makes that although Dyer's book is aesthetically worthless and "irreverent" of the beliefs it contains, it is a necessary book: a book that will reopen a world in danger of being lost to a scientific age. At the very start of his</page><page sequence="9">YEATS, FAIRIES, AND THE NEW ANIMISM 145 article, and having described an illustration by Blake—"Out of every flower and every grass-blade comes a little creature lifting its right hand above its head"—Yeats had argued, "It is possible that the books of folk lore, coming in these later days from almost every country in the world, are bringing the fairies and the spirits to our study tables that we may witness a like affirmation, and see innumerable hands lifted testifying to the ancient supremacy of imagination" (UPi 284). "We," of the present age, for want of a "living tradition" of belief in gods and spirits, "are trying to persuade the lecture and the scientific book to look, at least to the eye, like the old poems and dramas and stories that were in the ages of faith long ago" (UPi 285). Here is a moment of prophecy that the next forty years would bear out: that the science of comparative anthro pology could become the inspiration for a new literature, replacing the very animistic ontologies that it dismissed as delusive with an inclusive (if sceptical) account of them. In this context, Dyer's book, for all its faults, is "one of those classifications and reviews of already collected facts of which we stand in great need," and the "mythical method" of modernism raises its head. The stories that catch Yeats's particular attention from Dyer's book are those dealing with the destiny of the soul after death and, more particularly, those that suggest the spiritual value of birds and beasts: he has no truck with the humdrum accounts of ghosts of the normal "ghost-story" variety that actually make up the larger part of the work. Moreover, Yeats's review makes the book seem more global in scope than it actually is, because the examples of beliefs he cites from it are Tylorian and comparative in origin.28 Yet, typically, Yeats assesses these neither as delusive nor as proof of an "us/them" analogical anthropomorphism, but rather as examples of a dynamic, environmentally engaged aware ness of a world in flux that is both in itself creative and inspirational to poetic creativity: All these stories are such as to unite man more closely to the woods and hills and waters about him, and to the birds and animals that live in them, and to give him types and symbols for those feelings and passions which find no adequate expression in common life. . . . Let us listen humbly to the old people telling their stories, and perhaps God will send the primitive excellent imagination into the midst of us again. Why should we be either "naturalists" or "realists" alone? Are not those little right hands lifted everywhere in affirmation? (UPi 287-8) "Naturalism" was, of course, the term for both the Tylorian world in its preanimistic state and that peculiar, Lamarquian form of literary real ism that had captured the Zeitgeist of the late nineteenth century in France and beyond. "Naturalism" is, too, the word that modern theorists</page><page sequence="10">146 NEW LITERARY HISTORY use to denote a "Western fundamentalism" that has failed to grasp the importance of the "cosmos" because of its blinkered, anthropocentric materialism.29 Here is a lovely Yeatsian irony embedded in an argument that speaks to and supplements the claims that social scientists are making a hundred years later: modernist Western science has inadequate tools for treating the "astonishment" of animic ontologies with an appropriate "reverence," but the imagination of the West needs to reconnect with that astonishment and may do so (for want of other means) via the works of science that fail to do so. The question of how and why Yeats was able to see the potential of science to provide this resource, despite its entrenched materialism and his own equally entrenched mysticism, is explained by looking again at the inclusivity of "animism" as it was conceived in the 1870s and after. Tylor, in fact, only chose the word "animism" to designate the essential, delusive core of all religion because the more directly descriptive word "spiritualism" had already been appropriated by the spiritualist move ment, from which he wanted to distance himself.30 In trying to dissoci ate his theories from spiritualism, though, Tylor inadvertently made a connection that is essential to Yeats's later assimilation and colonization of his material. Tylor used the evidence of spiritualism to explain the beliefs of "savages" in a move that modern anthropologists have under standably seen as topsy-turvy,31 but, for Yeats, this was the legacy of his thinking that was most exciting. Yeats owned a copy of Andrew Lang's 1893 edition of Robert Kirk's The Secret Commonwealth of Elves, Fauns and Fairies, in which Lang had argued that the folklorist and the psychical researcher should acknowledge their shared interests,32 and it was an argument that Yeats would increasingly embrace when, in the twentieth century, his own spiritual interests shifted towards those of the Society for Psychical Research.33 Lang's embrace of psychical research may have been an apostasy in the eyes of his contemporaries (especially Frazer and Clodd),34 but it made his version of Tylorian anthropology particularly conducive to Yeats's vision. This, then, raises the concomitant question of why Yeats needed sci ence at all—if spiritualism was able to address the same issues as science in a way more conducive to his beliefs. What evolutionary comparative anthropology gave Yeats that spiritualism could not was a sense of the cultural authenticity of the animistic experience. Basing its findings on the evidence of folk belief and on "savage" practices observed throughout the colonies, sociocultural evolutionists suggested that the shared experi ence of the peoples of the world at an early stage of their development agreed as to the existence of shifting boundaries between the so-called spirit and the so-called body; between humanity and the natural world</page><page sequence="11">YEATS, FAIRIES, AND THE NEW ANIMISM 147 and other worlds. Embarking on his study of animism, Tylor had argued that Dr. Johnson was right—although he said it contemptuously—that, "one set of savages is like another" and "an English ploughman" and a "negro of Central Africa" have "scarce a hand's breadth difference" between them (PCi 6). This was an idea that would appeal greatly to Yeats, even if his emphasis was always on the continuity of that experi ence, rather than its evolutionary development; as he wrote in 1889: "The Irish peasant believes the whole world to be full of spirits, but then the most distinguished men have thought not otherwise. . . . Tradition is always the same. The earliest poet of India and the Irish peasant in his hovel nod to each other across the ages and are in perfect agreement."35 To acknowledge continuity was to put aside unanswerable questions about the relationship between the human mind and material nature that were the inheritance of the Enlightenment: Yeats could wield tradi tional wisdom to argue that the fairies were there, whether one believed in them or not. Yeats adapted ideas freely from Victorian anthropology, but he always refused its scientific methods and its materialist philoso phy. It is probably for this reason that he consistently avoided using the word "animism" itself, freighted as it was with the burden of its positivist acceptation.36 Nurit Bird-David's argument that we should see animism as a "relational (not a failed) epistemology" was partly foreshadowed, as a consequence, by Yeats's practice in his collections of Irish folklore in the eighties and nineties. His refusal to belittle folk belief as primitive, his insistence that "an assumption of [the fairies'] existence is the only fit theory to build a selection of fairy tales on,"37 and his rejection of the idea that the fairy beliefs he recorded were the result of an analogical/logical process all ally him with more recent defenders of animism. Even his continual juggling with the proper terms by which one should refer to the fairies foreshadows more recent debate: "the others" and "the gentry" and the "persons of the Tribes of Danu" are all traditional, "relational" terms that Yeats repeats. His motivations for doing so might be occultist, rather than observational, but the result is the same: the "personhood" of his fairies makes them comparable to the devaru of Southern India and the xapiripe of Amazonia. Moreover, it is quite possible that the anthropolo gists of his day helped him towards this nuanced understanding: Andrew Lang, in his introduction to Modern Mythology (complaining that Tylor's word "animism" "is not very clear"), described the savage's worldview as "a philosophy of things, stated in stories based on the belief in universal personality," and suggested (as ever) that this "hypothesis of universally distributed personality" was the core element of myth:38 this is not simply a dualistic definition.</page><page sequence="12">148 NEW LITERARY HISTORY Crucially, Tylor had argued that poetry was one of the few "civilized" spheres in which the animistic/mythic mode persisted,39 an idea that implicitly engaged with wider Victorian debates about the representation of "soul" in nature, and the question of whether in art and literature such representations could ever be more than the analogical projection of a subjective sensibility. In as much as his argument was that poetry needed the fluid and astonishing possibilities of animism, he seems to have been endorsing John Ruskin's diagnosis of the "pathetic fallacy" as a modern malaise that both apes and falls short of classical mythopoeic views of the cosmos. Although it is not yet clear to me whether Ruskin influenced Tylor directly, his ideas certainly seem to have shaped how Yeats in turn championed appropriately "reverent" treatments of the pluriverse. One early review of John Todhunter's poetry, for example, shows Yeats reflecting Ruskin's distinction in order to attack the egotism of the "Saxon" poet and to praise instead the flexuous "Celt," engaged, as he is, with a folklore that is intrinsically animistic. The Saxon, Yeats argued, is "always a lens colored by self."40 The same distinction had been made in a still earlier review of Samuel Ferguson: "At once the fault and the beauty of the nature-description of most modern poets is that for them the stars, and streams, the leaves, and the animals, are only masks behind which go on the sad soliloquies of a nineteenth century egotism" (UPi 103), whilst Ferguson's poetry expressed the animated world itself. By the time he wrote The Celtic Twilight, Yeats was "proving" that in Ireland nature was animated beyond the "sad soliloquies" of the mate rialist British Empire: the subject-object relations of nineteenth-century science were defiantly replaced by the subject-subject experience of the Celtic dawn in these prose anecdotes. In an extraordinary passage at the crux of "Regina, Regina, Pigmeorum, Veni," Yeats recounts an invocation of the Queen of the Fairies and her troops in which he was involved, on a "far western sandy shore." The fairies are explicitly defined as an intrinsic part of the landscape and not as the emanation of the emotions of the human beings who invoke them. Yeats sets about questioning the Queen through his "friend," who is entranced: "I then asked whether she and her people were not 'dramatizations of our moods'? 'She does not understand,' said my friend, 'but says that her people are much like human beings, and do most of the things human beings do.'"41 "As above, so below" was the watchword of Yeats's occultism in the 1890s and to question the fairies' autonomous personhood was a failure of respect, as this anecdote rather comically shows. In his poetry of the period we see the inner view of a spiritual land scape in which the "elemental creatures" that go about Yeats's table are transformed into the ghosts of the Irish nation itself—not living in its</page><page sequence="13">YEATS, FAIRIES, AND THE NEW ANIMISM 149 hills, but existing as part of them and part of the lives of the people whose mythology and lore continually remembers them. A poem like "The Hosting of the Sidhe" is an act of spiritual mapping,42 but it is also an aesthetic act of reanimation: from the geographic locale, "Knocknarea," we move to the pseudomythic grave of "Clooth-na-Bare,"43 and from this grounded signifier of animistic presence, the relentless tetrameter car ries us into the mythopoeic realm itself, into the continually changing, sexually-charged world of the persons of the Tribe of Danu. In fact, the whole world teeters on the edge of vision in The Wind Among the Reeds: it is a collection which heralds a new apocalypse by returning us to the "mental condition of savages," as defined by comparative anthropology,44 and celebrating that return. It is a world in which "anything might flow and change, and become any other thing," as Yeats described that of the ancient Celts in 1897,45 and where there is no strict division between this world and the "other." Here "sun and moon and hollow and wood / And river and stream" are all alive in a "mystical brotherhood," as Yeats tells us in "Into the Twilight" (Poems 76), and have wills that need work ing out as ours do. In this world, a trout can become "a glimmering girl / With apple blossom in her hair" before calling a name, and run ning, and fading into air (Poems 76-77). Like the "animic" worlds Tim Ingold struggles to describe, it is "in perpetual flux, as the beings that participate in it go their various ways."46 Here, nothing begins or ends with the human; nothing begins or ends with the defining subject of the poem, who is himself, like Mongan (Poems 78-79), constantly subject to change. That Yeats first used and then deleted the character names of the "voices" of some of these poems (Aedh, Hanrahan, Robartes, and Mongan himself) suggests how he struggled to find a suitably flexuous poetic voice to meet the demands of such a vision: beyond the objectivities of the nineteenth-century dramatic monologue and somehow intrinsic to the shifting, aerial landscape of which these voices form a part. In fact, "air" is a word used as often in the collection as the "wind" of its title, and both words together operate to confirm that this is a col lection that semantically, as well as actually, approximates the animistic. A favourite fact for Tylorian theorists of animism was that the words for "breath" and "air" and "wind" were related to that used for "spirit" in most languages.47 The "sidhe" who do the hosting in Yeats's poems, likewise, are both the spirits who haunt and the wind that blows: they are both the air that is breathed and the breath that animates. This is a "weather-world" (to use Ingold's phrase) in which Yeats's sidhe/winds are nature seen as spiritual and animate, rather than as sublime, or beautiful, or, indeed, picturesque.</page><page sequence="14">150 NEW LITERARY HISTORY In his 1897 essay "The Celtic Element in Literature," Yeats stated his favor for Matthew Arnold's view of the Celt over Ernest Renan's, because he agreed with Arnold that "naturalism" was not the word to describe the Celtic worldview: "The Celtic Passion for Nature comes almost more from a sense of her 'mystery' than of her 'beauty,'" he argued (£7173). But Yeats was not really favoring Arnold-the-theorist over Renan-the theorist, he was favouring Arnold-the-poet over Tylor and Lang and all the scientists.48 Yeats mounts a direct assault on the anthropological construction of animism when he writes that all the melancholy and beauty of Celtic literature comes "From this "mistaking dreams," which are perhaps essences, for "realities," which are perhaps accidents" (EI 181-82). The ironizing use of inverted commas begs us to prioritise the "animistic" view itself (based in its Tylorian form on the mistaken over-reading of dreams) over the rationalist view that has defined it as such. His purpose is made explicit in the flourish with which he ends his essay: "The reaction against the rationalism of the eighteenth century has mingled with a reaction against the materialism of the nineteenth century" (£7187) and the arts are about to become religious again. The evolution of thought from the magical to the religious and thence to the scientific is unravelling, for Yeats, and a new animism seems to be just around the corner. Appropriately then, and despite his continual questing for some absolute apocalyptic canvas against which to paint his fairytopia, the folklore that Yeats collates and comments upon in this period is actually suggestive of a series of relations between the things of this world and their parallels in an "other" world that are performative in just the way that modern theorists of animism insist they should be.49 So, trees and bushes and mounds of earth do not simply have a "life" that is analogous to what the Irish peasant feels within him/herself, they are part of a complex nexus of social and supra-social relations, involving, but not simply originating from, the cerebral responses of those human beings. In the first of a series of six major folklore articles, "The Tribes of Danu" (1898), Yeats notes that certain "queerly-shaped bushes" and certain trees are "frequented and protected" (UPii 60), but the relation between the trees and "tree-spirits" is ambiguous: "The people say that you must not hurt these bushes and trees, because 'the Others' have houses near them; but sometimes it seems that, if you hurt them, you hurt one of 'the Others'. ..." And he goes on to tell us that "souls are sometimes said to be put into trees for a penance" (UPii 61). There is no single relationship between the tree and its soul, or in the tree's inhabitance by an "other" or in the tree's inhabitance by a human soul—and Yeats allows it to be so. The "persons" of the fairy world, as Yeats presents</page><page sequence="15">YEATS, FAIRIES, AND THE NEW ANIMISM 151 them, are "dividual" ("a person constitutive of relationships"50) and the things of the world are part of a locally defined network of relations between the environment, the human beings who form a part of it, and a spiritual realm that is both separate and intrinsic to this. Fairy spirits, as Yeats shows us them, "operate within the context of social practices." Writing about the Clonmel witch-burning trials in his 1902 essay "Away" (the last of the six articles), Yeats argued that those on trial "only half knew" their beliefs, because they did not realize either their relational or their performative nature: "In fact," he explained, "mankind and spirit kind each have their hostage. These explanatory myths are not a speculative, but a practical wisdom" (UPii 277). To use Morten Pedersen's phrase, Yeats presents the Sidhe as part of a "super-sociality: that weaves together persons of all sorts, be they humans, animals, or spirit entities."51 This is apparent when Yeats explains that 'Young children are believed to be in greater danger than anybody else, and the number of those whose cries are heard in the wind shows how much 'the others' have to do with the wind" (UPii 76). The wind is not simply a metaphor for the Sidhe, nor simply a reason why the peasants need to invent the Sidhe, but rather the wind-Sidhe equation is part of an interaction in which the wind, the Sidhe, and the human beings all partake of the same society, whilst each having different natures. The interaction might be instructively compared with the description Eduardo Viveiros De Castro gives of the workings of spirits in Amazonia: "A spirit in Amazonia is less a thing than an image, less a term than a relation, less an object than an event, less a transcendent representative figure than a sign of the immanent universal background—the background that comes to the surface in shamanism, in dreams and in hallucinations, when the human and the nonhuman, the visible and invisible trade places."52 That de Castro sees this process of trading as being linked to a diachronic reconnection with the ancient but timeless realm of the mythic,53 and that he continually discusses the xapiripe in terms that are related to language and "image," only makes the comparison with Yeats the more tantalising. Tim Ingold also argues that "In most animic cosmologies . . . the winds are taken to be alive and to have agentive powers of their own."54 This is how Yeats saw the winds of Irish fairy-lore, but for him their as sociation with change was apocalyptic, as well as continuous. He would reinvoke both the formal and the actual presence of these winds in his poems of the 1920s dealing with the Irish War of Independence and the Civil War: the final part of "Meditations in Time of Civil War" carries a title that reminds us of the Mongan poem in The Wind Among the Reeds and the wind blows through and partakes of the tricksy, self-destructive</page><page sequence="16">152 NEW LITERARY HISTORY images of Loie Fuller et al in "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen" that turbulently embody unwilled macrocosmic changes that the poet descries behind those changes that are simply the product of human will. It is no accident, perhaps, that in order to illustrate her claim for the "ani mism" of Yeats's formal and imagistic practices in this later poetry—his ability to "think unallegorically" in poems in which "[poetic]form is not a body but an agent"—Angela Leighton must refer back to Yeats's writ ings from the 1890s:®5 this was the period of Yeats's deepest immersion in the currents of an animistic super-reality, both intellectually and in terms of his poetic practice. Moreover, Yeats's sense that animistic forces have an intrinsic, radically anti-anthropocentric power allies him with modern anthropologists, and with Viveiros de Castro especially. In a guest editorial to Anthropology Today, written in January 2009, Latour describes a disputatio between Descola and de Castro, which took place in Paris that month about "perspectivism" (where "perspectivism" defines the relational view of ani mistic personhood particular to the fieldwork of these anthropologists). Latour recounts how de Castro distanced his own view from Descola's: "Perspectivism, in [de Castro's] view, should not be regarded as a simple category within Descola's typology, but rather as a bomb with the po tential to explode the whole implicit philosophy so dominant in most ethnographers' interpretations of their material. If there is one approach that is totally anti-perspectivist, it is the very notion of a type within a category, an idea that can only occur to those Viveiros calls 'republican anthropologists.'"56 One is reminded of Yeats's zeal for that mystical bombshell: "the revolt of the soul against the intellect,"57 as well as his oft-expressed hatred of the scientific practice of "pinning" the evidence of folkloric ontologies as so many dead butterflies. When Irish fairy lore was finally collected and recorded in an ethnographically authoritative way, after the foundation of An Cumann le Bealoideas Eireann in 1927, it was indeed seen as "a type within a category." In Sean O Suilleabhain's 1942 classic, A Handbook of Irish Folklore, memorats of the fairies were collected as a type under the category "Supernatural Beings," which was itself a subsection of "Chapter X: Mythological Tradition." "The Afterworld" was also a subsection of this chapter, but "Nature" was seen as an entirely different category and had a chapter all to itself (Chapter 6), as did "Human Life."58 For Yeats in Ireland in the 1890s, as for de Castro in Amazonia in the 1990s and 2000s, the implications of accepting the indigenous ontology of animating spirits were explosive to Western post-Enlightenment thinking, precisely because they were at the heart of a human-natural-supernatural sociality that gave the lie to such neat ethnographic boundaries.</page><page sequence="17">YEATS, FAIRIES, AND THE NEW ANIMISM 153 It would be wrong, however, to imply that Yeats somehow managed to overcome all problems inherent in a Cartesian dualism by being "baptised with fairy water" in the 1890s: there was no total immersion for him, and he struggled to frame appropriately his knowledge, first, that fairy lore was not actually part of a current, complete ontology in Ireland and, secondly, that he was not himself a part of the peasant communities he represented. Rather than seeing how problematic this relationship was, in fact, Yeats chose to suggest increasingly that his oc cult studies somehow gave him access to the spiritual root of the beliefs that these communities were in the process of losing. Whatever else I am claiming for Yeats, I am claiming neither that he was a disinterested ethnographer nor that his "animistic" period lasted long. By the time Yeats wrote "Magic" (which cites Andrew Lang by name) in 1901, he had moved away from the inclusive embrace of animistic possibilities that was his in the 1890s. The "credo" at the heart of this essay is uprooted from the material realities of community life, although it recounts ex periences from the 1890s that seemed then to partake in a "wisdom" shared by the Ainu, "the Indian sage," and the Irish alike. Yeats merely argues in "Magic" that the borders of mind are ever shifting, that sym bols give access to the "great mind" and the "great memory," and that he himself and his fellow mages have been experimenting for years in the invocation of magical visions: the grave of Clooth na Bare seems as distant as Sakhalin. But something did remain in the new century: despite his growing elitism, Yeats's conception of Celtic spirituality continued to be associ ated with his commitment to an aesthetic of (idealized) communality. Just as he fondly drew a distinction between Saxon egotism and the more generous sympathies of the Celts in the 80s and 90s, so in "Magic" he distinguished between the "modern" view of things and the view of "barbaric" people: "We [the moderns] are always praising men in whom the individual life has come to perfection, but they were always praising the one mind, their foundation of all perfection" (£7 44). In so saying, he was echoing a Theosophical teaching, "the one self has to forget itself for the many selves,"59 which would ultimately become his own famous cry for impersonality in art: "all that is personal soon rots; it must be packed in ice or salt" (EI 522)—but these ideas had been fuelled by his studies in animism. Addressing the issue in 1899, he had written: "A change in thought in the world makes us understand that we are not walled up within our immediate senses, but bound one to another, and to some greater life, by a secret communion of thought and emotion" (UPii 165). And the legacy of this stayed. Yeats's "Great Mind and Great Memory," and their appearance as the "Anima Mundi"</page><page sequence="18">154 NEW literary HISTORY in his later theorizations (Lang notes in The Making of Religion, the book Yeats cited in "Magic," that for Tylor, "Animistic conceptions thus reach their utmost limit in the notion of the Anima Mundi"60), were his expla nation for the source of his symbolism and the medium through which he might break down "the dykes that separate man from man" (£7241): all were testament to his belief that the limits of "modernity" included the limiting of personhood to homologous individuals. Ingold has argued that, "above all," positivist commentators on ani mistic societies "make the mistake of assuming that life and mind are interior properties of individuals that are given, independently and in advance of their involvement in the world."61 Yeats is no positivist and does not succumb to this mistake, despite his commitment to the power of the individual imagination. "The mind changing changes all," but it is also acted upon by "moods" that lie beyond its scope and by an an thropomorphic world in which image, object, and "soul" snakishly fuse and refuse. In his fairy lore and in the poetry that springs from it in the 1880s and 90s, Yeats opposes his understanding of the "relatedness" of persons in the world to the "totalizing scheme of separated essences" that is, in Nurit Bird-David's terms "the object of modernist epistemol ogy," but he does so in a way that is tellingly indebted to the details that lie behind the "totalizing schemes" of nineteenth-century science.
