<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE MIME OF GOD: VIVES ON THE NATURE OF MAN BY MARCIA L. COLISH Until recently, Juan Luis Vives' philosophy of man has been of peripheral interest to scholars. Working primarily from his psycho- logical and educational writings and his social and political thought, most commentators have drawn Vives into focus either by viewing him as a precursor of subsequent contributors to these disciplines or by using him to support a religious or nationalistic bias.2 With the printing of an English translation of his Fabula de homine, however, a fresh approach to Vives has been made which starts from his ideas on the nature of man. Yet, although placed among the selections published by the editors of The Renaissance Philosophy of Man, the Fabula has been included only as a "sort of appen- 1 See especially W. C.

Until this is done, however, it remains impossible to discern both the precise extent of Vives' debt to Pico della Mirandola and the position he occupies in the thought of the Renaissance. The Fabula de homine (1518) is one of Vives' earliest works, written when Vives (1492-1540) was twenty-six, and had recently come to Flanders after completing his formal education at the Uni- versity of Paris. Employed at the time as tutor to William de Croy, Cardinal and Archbishop-elect of Toledo, and Antoine de Berges, the young Belgian nobleman to whom the opuscule is dedicated, the youthful Valencian had already composed a series of brief de- votional works9 and several commentaries on classical authors.10 3 The Renaissance Philosophy of Man, ed.

Although stating in 1518 his intention to develop the theme of human life in another, more extensive work, "if, some day, I should have the free time," Vives deals with the nature of man per se in the Fabula alone. His intention was unrealized; the Fabula remains the point from which any discussion of his philosophy of man must begin. The Fabula is conceived in theatrical terms. Jupiter, in com- pliance with Juno's wish to provide an entertainment for the gods on the occasion of her birthday feast, creates the vast amphitheatre of the world, containing celestial stalls occupied by the divine spec- tators according to their rank and the stage of the earth, where the action is to take place. Scenarist and director of the drama as well as creator of the amphitheatre, Jupiter "instituted everything and instructed all that they might understand. So that nothing might be done differently from what he pleased, he prescribed to the troupe of actors the entire order and sequence of the plays, from which not even by the breadth of a finger, as they say, should they de- part." 12 So that his production may proceed as planned, Jupiter stands as it were in the wings, giving the starting signal and the cue for each of the players in turn. The last to perform is the protagonist, man. The wisest in the audience and those sitting close to Jupiter do not hesitate to grant him critical recognition. The pleasure Jupiter takes in "the human archmime" 13 is enough to make his paternity patent; a closer look confirms the judgment. Recognizable as "the image of Jupiter," man, although "concealed under a mask," often seems on the verge of bursting through it, revealing himself "in many things . . . clearly divine," and participating in the imnmortality, wisdom, prudence, memory, and many other attributes of his celestial progenitor.14 As man's performance gets under way, the extent to which he partakes of the powers of the greatest of gods is made manifest. "Jupiter's own mime" 15 at once proceeds to "transform himself so as to appear under the mask of the plant," simple and devoid of sensation.'6 Withdrawing, he soon reappears in a thousand animal shapes, representing various moral traits.17 Then, after a brief inter- mission, "the curtain was raised and he returned a man, prudent, just, sociable, human, kindly, and companionable. He frequented cities with other men; he ruled and was ruled in turn. With others "lJuan Luis Vives, dedication to Fabula de homine. Opera omnia . . ., ed.

COLISH he attended to matters of public interest and welfare, and, in a word, was in no way either uncivil or unsocial." 18 Having changed his masks with his own hands up to this point, man, much to the surprise of the gods, now indulges in a passive metamorphosis, being "remade into one of their own species, transcending the nature of man and relying entirely on a most wise mind." 19 Hailing him as Protean, the gods beg Juno to let him unmask and join them, "to make of him a spectator rather than an actor," 20 but before she can ask her husband's permission, man reappears in the r6le of Jupiter, mimicking his father with such accuracy that some of his fellow players, de- ceived into swearing "that this was not man but Jupiter himself, ... underwent harsh punishment for such an error." 21 The gods, however, are wiser than men. Although at first dis- comfited by man's performance, they at once realize that what they have witnessed has been but an imitation of the divine, albeit apt and skillful, rather than the divine itself. 22 Renewing their request, they obtain the compliance of Jupiter, who "granted the gods what he himself, long before, had decided to transfer to man," recalling him from the stage and seating him among the gods in triumph. 23 With man in their midst, the gods avail themselves of the opportunity to scrutinize him closely. Stripped of the mask of his body, which had made him the desultory creature they had seen on the stage, "the whole man, laid bare, revealed to the immortal gods his nature akin to theirs.. . . 24 Examining man's stage costumes themselves, and noting that his body is so ingeniously contrived as to be no less handsome and harmoniously disposed than it is useful and appropriate, "they praised Jupiter's wisdom and skill and adored him... .p2B Man, received as a brother by the gods, 26 who deem it "unworthy of him to . . . practice the disreputable theatrical art,"' 27 is further perceived to possess wisdom, prudence, knowledge, memory, speech, and reason. By means of these faculties he brings forth institutions, arts and sciences, language, and writing, through which he transmits many doctrines, including religion. 28 Religion, linked with memory, enables man almost to approximate that power to know the future enjoyed by the divine.29 So delighted are the gods with their human guest that many of them pass the afternoon contemplating him and questioning him about his various activities, which he lucidly explains. Then, crowned and clad in purple, refreshed with nectar and ambrosia, he observes the festivities from the best seats in the house. As the Fabula draws to a close, man is seen reclining in honor at an Olympian repast. He replaces his bodily mask; "since it had suited the needs of man so 18Ibid, 5. 9,20,21Ibid. 22Ibid.) 5-6. 23 Ibid.) 6. 24,25 Ibid. 268Ibid.) 7. 272,9Ibid.</page><page sequence="5">VIVES ON MAN' S NATURE 7 well it was judged worthy of the most sumptuous feast and of the table of the gods. Thus it was given the power of perception and enjoyed the eternal bliss of the banquet." 30 There are many similarities between the conception of man which emerges from the Fabula and that voiced by Pico della Mirandola in his Oratio de homtinis dignitate. Equally striking are the differences in terms of which Pico and Vives envisage the scope of man's powers, the nature of his end, and the means by which he is to reach it. The formal structure of the Fabula is the first point at which it may be compared with the Oratio. Both works begin almost immedi- ately with the framing of man as a changeable creature. It is only partially true to state that "Vives' version, in its mythological setting, is less precise than Pico's. " 31 As a piece of deliberate mythog- raphy, the Fabula, with its cosmological scope, unity of theme, and full-blown pantheon, is at once more detailed and more compact than the Oratio. Unlike Pico, Vives makes no excursions from the text to comment on the opinions of a host of philosophers of varying degrees of relevance. In addition, his use of a narrative rather than a rhetorical style makes the Fabula a work with more economy and integrity than the rambling Oratio. The motif of the stage, left inchoate in the Oratio,32 becomes the organizing principle of the Fabula.83 In lieu of Pico's nondescript God, neither pagan nor Christian, Vives selects a coherent cast of classical deities with which man's nature may be compared. Although by no means a mystagogue of Pico's proportions, Vives indicates in this choice of a pagan setting that he wishes to cloak the sublime in the mythological rather than overtly to demonstrate the possible compatibility of Ciceronianism and Christianity.34 Since the Fabula was directed to the cognoscentes, Vives could confidently express the profound parabolically. In detailing the extent of man's powers, however, Pico is far more explicit than Vives. The God of the Oratio leaves nothing in question in His creation speech to Adam: Neither a fixed abode nor a form that is thine alone nor any function pe- culiar to thyself have we given thee, Adam, to the end that according to thy longing and according to thy desire thou mayest have and possess what abode, what form, and what functions thou thyself shalt desire.... Thou, 30Ibid., 8. 31 Lenkeith, op. cit., 385. 32 Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, Oratio de hominis dignitate, trans. E. L. Forbes in Renaissance Philosophy of Man, 223, 238. 33 It is surprising that Miss Lenkeith, so anxious to show Vives' dependence on Pico, does not note the latter's use of this motif although she does mention its classical sources. Op. cit., 385. 34 The filiation of this taste is given masterful treatment by Edgar Wind, Pagan Mysteries in the Renaissance (New Haven, 1958), 14-20, 24-30.</page><page sequence="6">8 MARCIA L. COLISH constrained by no limits, in accordance with thine own free will, ... shalt ordain for thyself the limits of thy nature.... We have made thee neither of heaven nor of earth, neither mortal nor immortal, so that with freedom of choice and with honor, as though the maker and molder of thyself, thou mayest fashion thyself in whatever shape thou shalt prefer.35 For Pico man's freedom is hence unlimited. God posits no criterion in whose light the exercise of man's creative volition is to be judged. That human freedom is at all qualified by a moral imperative results from the self-initiated action of man's will. Cognizant of his own nature, he decides that some of his potentialities are better than others, and that these must be developed toward the good in pref- erence to the rest lest his freedom be rendered "something harmful instead of salutary." 36 The good is the eternal; this must therefore be his end. Accordingly, Pico's man directs himself toward God, Who, having left man to unravel his own destiny after the creation, now appears only as an object of erotic contemplation. In spanning the gap that separates him from God man is led by philosophy, a guide whose powers enable him to carry out the three Delphic precepts. He can comply with the injunction "Nothing in excess" with the aid of moral philosophy, by which the grievous discord raging between the flesh and the spirit is subdued, the animal passions are bridled, and internal harmony is brought to his soul.37 Man achieves knowledge of self through natural philosophy, which, in addition to allaying "the strife and differences of opinion which vex, distract, and wound the spirit from all sides," 38 "urges and encourages us to the investigation of all nature, of which the nature of man is ... the connecting link.... For he who knows himself in himself knows all things. ..."39 Rational progress, "in a rhythmical measure," 40 is accomplished by means of Platonic dialectic, appeasing "the tumults of reason made confused and anxious by inconsistencies of statement and sophisms of syllogisms." 41 Theology now ushers us to the final stage of supra- rational mystic frenzy, at which point, "uttering the theological greet- ing, ... 'Thou art, 42 "roused by ineffable love as by a sting, .... rapt from ourselves, full of divine power we shall no longer be our- selves but shall become He Himself Who made us." 43 Thus by his own efforts man transforms himself into God. Endowed at first with an indeterminacy so unqualified as to be in practice no different from divine omnipotence, man also shares with his Maker the attributes of creativity and universality. In freedom he devises his own end; the definition of the good and the desire for it emanate from his own judgment and will.

The achievement of this goal depends on man's successful completion of a personally instituted programme. The man who reaches the top of the ladder of the Lord is neither absorbed into the Godhead nor granted communion with God as a creature, albeit worthy. At the point of culmination, man actually is God. By his own powers he has created himself. God may contribute the raw matter of human self-deification, but man provides the guiding lines and conceives the end toward which he propels himself without out- side aid. Compared with this fully autonomous creature, Vives' archmime seems feeble indeed. The contrast may be placed in still clearer relief if the ideas on man found in Vives' other writings be brought to bear on the issue. Although testifying to human nature only in passing, these writings at no point contradict the views enunciated in the Fabula. The random references they provide are, in addition, more than merely consonant with Vives' central concept of man. His other works function as the Fabula's embodiment, embellishment, and exegesis. The limitations under which Vives' man labors are, like his poten- tialities, divinely imposed and regulated. Even as the creation takes place the outgoing gesture of a self-sufficient deity rather than the anthropomorphic manifestation of a supreme Architect 45 who sub- sequently packs up his tools and departs, so the play begins, proceeds at all points, and culminates in accordance with Jupiter's express directions. Man is given a script of the scenario; he may extemporize only within the limits of the stock situations and stock characters he is called upon to represent. Capable of donning the mask of the vegetable, the animal, and the human being. by himself, he must be acted upon by an outside power before he can assume a celestial costume. He shares only some of the talents of the divine; his posses- sion of "a most wise mind" enables him to be made godlike and his filial resemblance makes it possible for him to masquerade as Jupiter. At best, however, he is only the mime of Jupiter. Vives makes it quite clear that man cannot become Jupiter, either actively or passively.46 That those who are foolish enough to think so are subject to severe punishment is enough to correct Miss Len- 44Ibid., 225. 45Ibid., 224. 4- Thus he does not have "an unlimited power of self-transformation," as Miss Lenkeith claims; also her opinion that "he transforms himself into the god Jupiter" is mistaken. Op. cit., 386.</page><page sequence="8">10 MARCIA L. COLISH keith's interpretation of this point. She finds a reminiscence of the dogma of the Incarnation in the "co-essentiality of Jupiter and his son." 4 This proposed co-essentiality, as well as being non-existent in the text of the Fabula, is also less suggestive of Vives' man than of Pico's. Vives doubtless would have considered the idea blas- phemous. The mimicry of Jupiter is hence more of a warning than a man- date. Man's apotheosis for Vives consists in his recall from the stage and his permanent installation on Olympus as the honored guest and brother of the gods. This involves not self-transmutation in the crucible of frenzy but Jupiter's explicit invitation. No gate crashers are tolerated at the banquet of the gods. The welcome which renders the stage obsolete comes man's way less because of the virtuosity of his performance than because Jupiter has previously decided to extend it out of his gratuitous benificence.48 Escape from the domain of process is thus the goal for both Vives and Pico. Differing as to the extent to which man personally effects this redemption, they yet agree that his mutability is the pathway to the realm of eternal repose. Describing man as Protean, their allusion to the classical myth shares the same transformation of meaning. Vergil's Proteus is subject to endless indiscriminate meta- morphoses simply because change is of his nature; the Proteus of Pico and Vives is a Proteus who climbs Jacob's ladder. Process, although it cannot be conceived as an end in itself, still exerts a powerful attractive force upon both thinkers. This is par- ticularly true of Pico. Unending peace seems wan and monotonous compared with the brilliant intensity of the colors he uses to delineate the luxuriant diversity of man's inner faculties and the exhilarating dynamism of man's creative powers. His is a philosophy of agency rather than a philosophy of Being. The vision of the Empyrean he finds infinitely less fascinating than the multiform paths by which man reaches it. Vives, too, is struck by the range of man's activities, despite the fact that he dilates on the delights of beatitude somewhat more fully than Pico does. Both of them are deeply impressed by the interrela- tionship of human nature and human action. Pico treats the idea that one is what he does in explicit fashion: For if you see one abandoned to his appetites crawling on the ground, it is a plant and not a man you see; if you see one blinded by the vain illusions of imagery, . . . and, softened by their gnawing allurement, delivered over to his senses, it is a beast and not a man you see. If you see a philosopher 47Ibid., 385. 48 Miss Lenkeith, ibid., 386, holds that this grant is a reward for man's activ'ity.</page><page sequence="9">VIVES ON MAN' S NATURE 11 determining all things by means of right reason ... he is a heavenly being and not of this earth. If you see a pure contemplator, one unaware of the body and confined to the inner reaches of the mind, he is neither an earthly nor a heavenly being; he is a more reverend divinity vested with human flesh.49 Vives deals with this question more generally through the use of the image of the stage; in the first instance, the nature of man is approached in terms of the part he plays. His intrinsic self, however, fascinating as it may be, is not necessarily coextensive with his actions. Like Pico,50 Vives deems the essence of man a marvel. On seeing man unmasked and stripped of his accidents, the gods of the Fabula are moved to silent wonder.51 Yet it is the contemplation of his accomplishments and the inquiry into his manifold operations which evoke their insatiable curiosity. This distinction drawn by Vives between man's essence and his activity springs from his conception of man's intellectual limitations. The essences of things may be objects of wonder; they are not, how- ever, legitimate objects of knowledge. Although Vives as well as Pico is concerned with self-knowledge and repeatedly enjoins his readers to seek it,52 he does not think that a grasp of the essence of the soul falls within its scope.53 The intrinsic nature of the soul remains hidden from man.54 "It is not a matter which should be too important for us to know what the soul is, but rather . . . what it is like and what its operations are," 55 he states. God has not granted us the faculties of intelligence, will, and memory so that we may know what they are; "what they may be is known to Him Who is their Author.... " 56 When Vives does at length analyze the nature of the soul, he proceeds not by definition but by description, in terms of its functions and its aptitudes.57 There are several reasons why the inquiry into essential qualities is forbidden to man. One is entirely practical. So immense, so un- limited is the nature of things that it is impossible for man fully to comprehend it. All efforts to do so will be unfruitful; man will only 49 Pico, Oratio, 226. &gt; "It is a matter past faith and a wondrous one . . . that man is rightly called and judged a great miracle and a wonderful creature indeed."

COLISH dissipate the energies and abilities which might better be applied to endeavors more hopeful of results.58 Idle curiosity may be dangerous to man as well as wasteful,"9 since the things that are hidden are the province of God, and of God alone.60 Any attempt to penetrate them is rebelliously to presume the prerogatives of the Deity, to invite punishment at His hands, and this, to Vives, is distasteful as well as sinful. Pico, on the other hand, reveals in the Oratio a certain restlessness and, indeed, a trace of libido sciendi. The worship of God is not enough for him; it is an agency through which "we may like heavenly eagles boldly endure the most brilliant splendor of the meridian sun." 6l Vives is more cautious and more reverent. Majesty, in his opinion, shouild inspire not the perverted obsession to know all but the humble joy of adoration.62 Moreover, to fix one's gaze on the eye of Apollo is to be met with a blinding stare. "He who searches into divine Majesty will be devastated by its glory,"' 63 he affirms. Human omniscience, in addition, would rob the universe of its rich, mysterious life, its drama, its arcane meaningfulness. It would make God an unwelcome stranger in His own dwelling place. To Vives such a world would have seemed sterile, hollow, and colorless, as disagreeable as it would have been inconceivable. Man, then, can operate solely within certain specifically regulated areas of inquiry and endeavor. His freedom is qualified not only by the nature of its object but also by the composition of his will. The will tends toward the good; 64 it "can desire nothing except that which is seen under some aspect of the good and can reject only that which is seen under some aspect of evil. . t 65 Hence, "the will is free to the extent that it chooses between an act and its omission," 66 and to that extent alone. When faced with a good object, it may choose to react either positively or passively; it cannot react negatively. Similarly, when faced with an evil object, it may react either neg- atively or passively, but cannot react positively.67 In deciding whether an object is good or evil, the will is counseled by the reason and the judgment. Despite the fact that it is not bound to accept their advice, it works out in practice "that the will craves or avoids 58 De veritate fidei Christianiae, I,ii;iii.

God has granted us liberty sufficient for us "to form ourselves as we wish with the aid of His favor and grace." 69 These aids and limitations mark the resources and boundaries of the terri- tory wherein human creativity may function. Although man's creative activity seems radically circumscribed here when compared with the scope it enjoys in the Oratio, the land it rules is for Vives both wide and fecund. Its dominion-what is generally described as man's natural life-may be subsumed in the Fabula under the masks of the vegetable, the animal, and the human being. The vegetable is not an object of undue concern for Vives. He quickly passes on to the animal, which symbolizes for him the reign of the passions and which acts as the setting of a psychomachia. Like Pico, he describes a state of civil war between the mind and the body, almost comparable to the schism existing in the soul of the sinner,70 a breach which can be healed with the aid of moral philosophy.7' The passions are not to be excised, even for therapeutic purposes, for this would place man "outside the human condition, to be sure, in a kind of mental eclipse or in a perpetual spasm of the spirit. . "72 Rather, the passions are to be domesticated, re- oriented, instructed in virtue. When ethics has completed its task of moral integration, the passions may be made to bear the classic fruits of prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance, and man may begin to restore himself to his original humanity.73 Above all, Vives is fascinated by the mask of the human being. This is the role in which man's talents may be exhibited par excel- lence. To play it with all its innuendoes requires the fullest use of his freedom and the consummation of each of his natural faculties. The prudence and justice revealed in the man of the Fabula having been gained by the exercise of morality, it remains for him to develop his humanity, to become cordial, kindly, and wise, to be "in no way either uncivil or unsocial." Man reaches this goal by the twin paths of education and action. Education includes every ramification of the studia humanitatis. Vives defines the various disciplines so com- prised as those "by means of which we separate ourselves from the 68 Ibid. Opera omnia, III,382. 69Ibid.

COLISH way of life and customs of animals and are restored to humanity. ". 74 "The branches of learning are called humanistic; since they make us human." 75 This cultivation of the mind has a harvest richer than mere erudition; the more closely one approximates the ideal of humanitas, the more generous, courteous, affable, and well spoken will he be.76 Thus the subject matter of education has both an inward and an outward dimension. Philosophy, for example, which enables man "to live well and happily," 77 to escape the humiliating allegiance exacted by Fortune,78 to achieve inner composure, also imposes "truly human customs" in cities and households as well as in each man's heart.79 "Without its principles and without its precepts, neither private nor public matters could exist; nor would it be possible to gather men together in groups." 80 Man can scarcely enter into har- monious relationships with others unless he is at one with himself; 81 conversely, true knowledge conduces to true action. Learning must thus be put into practice in everyday life for the good of society as well as for the personal benefit of the savant. "This then is the fruit of all studies.... Having ourselves acquired the arts of scholarship, we should seek to apply them to the arts of life, and employ them for the public good. . . . Every study is unlimited in itself, but at some point we ought to begin to turn it to the con- venience and advantage of other people." 82 There is one humanistic discipline in particular which is by nature supremely suited to this purpose: the study of history. Vives is explicit on the uses of the past: The true usefulness, indeed also the necessity of history, is discerned in 74De disciplinis. Opera omnia, VI,5. See also De tradendis disciplinis, V,iii.

See also De tradendis disciplinis, I,iv. Opera omnia, VI,259-60. At times statements of this type lead Watson, in the introduction to his translation of De tradendis disciplinis, to depict Vives as a forerunner of modem utilitarian social theory. However, since human society is not an end in itself for Vives, neither can the social utility toward which he directs education be seen as an end in itself. Cf. Otto Burger, Erasmus von Rotterdam und der Spanier Vives (Munich, 1914), 20-I; Paul Jlg, Die Selbsttiitigkeit als Bildungsprinzip bei Johann Ludwig Vives (1492-1540) (Lan- gensalza, 1931), 18; Gunther, op. cit., 23; Hofer, op. cit., 104-S5. The humanistic ideal of utilitas has been understood most clearly in this connection by Florence A. Gragg, "Two Schoolmasters of the Renaissance," The Classical Journal, XIV (Jan. 1919), 211.</page><page sequence="13">VIVES ON MAN S NATURE 15 daily life.... What shall I say of its great importance for the conduct of public affairs and the regulation of the labors of the populace? . . . Yet there are those who persuade themselves that a knowledge of the past is useless, since the ways of life have changed everywhere. . . . It is undeniable that everything has changed, and changes daily, for, to be sure, these changes spring from our will and industry. But such alterations do not take place in those things encompassed by Nature.... It is more important by far to know this fact than to know how men of old dressed or constructed build- ings. For what greater prudence is there than to know how and what the human passions are; how they are roused, how quelled? To know also what influence they bring to bear on the commonwealth, their motivating forces, how they can be contained, healed, put aside, or, on the other hand, inflamed and fomented, whether in others or ourselves? What can be more expedient either for the ruler of a city or for any of his subj ects to know? And what can be more delightful, what more conducive to the most fruitful kind of prudence? For, in truth, is it not more auspicious to be warned by the evils others have suffered than to learn from one's own misfortunes? Thus it is that history acts as an example of what we should follow, and what we should avoid.83 History is thus useful to instruct as well as to delight, since it reveals the unchanging character of human nature, knowledge of which is indispensable to the conduct of public affairs. This places a great responsibility on the historian's shoulders, for "the first law of history is that it be true, insofar as the historian can achieve this." 84 The historian may neither add nor subtract; he must represent the facts in the same perspective in which they really appear.85 The image produced by history, "the mirror of past things," 8 must be un- distorted so that it can function didactically for the greatest benefit of society. In social intercourse and civic and political life man's human role finds its most complete realization. These areas of existence are necessary for the attainment of humanitas; "we men are, in truth, born for society, and cannot live fully without it." 87 Acting in collec- 83De tradendis disciplinis, V,i. Opera omnia, VI,389-90. History is not only the most useful discipline, it is also the most delightful: "I know not how else history may be seen to surpass all other studies, since it is the only one which either gives birth to, or nourishes, develops, or cultivates all the arts. It does this not through bitter and troublesome precepts and exercises, but by delectation of the mind, so that you drink in at the same time the most noble and fruitful knowledge and a real recreation and refreshment of the mind."

COLISH tive bodies implies mutual dependence among men and imposes upon them a joint responsibility for those unable to care for themselves.88 Public life, law and order, productive work as well as the life of study and contemplation, "all those things which make men better," can flourish only in peace; hence Vives condemns war.89 His pacifism also has Biblical roots: God is the Father of all men; they should therefore live together as brothers.90 For Vives, men are equal in the eyes of God, but nowhere else. He is well aware that knowledge and power may be perverted and made instruments of evil by those who do not have the capacity or the inclination to use them properly. "One need not place a sword in the hands of a madman," 91 he states. Men have been granted varying degrees of intelligence and judgment, qualities which he finds conspicuous for their absence in the ranks of the common people. The multitude he calls "a many-headed monster"; 92 its opinions are notoriously erroneous and should be avoided by the seeker of wisdom even as they are by the ruler.93 Clearly no democrat,94 Vives believes that man can best perfect his social and political nature by fulfilling the duties of his own particular station conscientiously and cheerfully. The very order and fitness which permeate the full blossoming of man's humanity bear witness to the wisdom which rules and attends it. This wisdom is prudence, born of man's judgment and experience. It is "the skill of accommodating all things of which we make use in life to their appropriate places, times, persons, and functions." " All the activities that fall within the scope of man's natural life should properly take place in accordance with it. There 88De subventione pauperum, I,xi; II,i. Opera omnia, IV,461,465.

He is corrected by Enrico Rivari, "Un grande umanista spagnuolo del secolo XVI contro il communismo," Nuova antologia (Dec. 1, 1937), 359-60, whose rabid partisanship, however, tends to prejudge the issue. 89 Letter to Henry VIII of England, De pace inter Caesarum et Franciscum Gallorum regem, deque optimo regni statu.

This is piety, which "stands alone and has a special claim to the name of Wisdom. . . . " It exists "to teach us who God is, and how we ought to act towards Him"; 96 it comprehends the celestial light that makes it possible for man to view the immutable.97 The "most wise mind" upon which the protagonist of the Fabula relies entirely when he is made a god, "transcending the nature of man," is a mind illuminated by piety. The cultivation of this wisdom extends throughout the whole of life.98 Compared with it the wisdom of the world is pure ignorance and folly.99 Its beginning is the fear of God, its end is the vision of God; the pathway it follows is the love of God. On the road that leads to beatitude man is by no means alone. He is guided by the mediatrix of religion,10 theology, which for Vives, as for Pico, is the queen of the sciences. Religion has been granted to man by God; "it not only teaches us how to come to Him, but also leads us by the hand," 101 since man's natural powers are in- adequate to secure that end: This then is religion, which we receive from God Himself, a ray from His Light, strength from His Omnipotence. This alone leads us back to the source whence we came, and towards which we bend our way. Nor is there any other perfection of man, for when this is accomplished, every end for which he was formed is obtained.... Wherefore, since that is the perfection of man's nature, and the consummation of all its parts; and since piety is the only way of perfecting man, and accomplishing the end for which he was formed, therefore piety is of all things the one thing necessary.'02 Man's aspiration to consummate his form is thus preceded, aided, and resolved by the grace of God. Vives describes man's love for God in terms of Platonic Eros: "Love is the desire to delight in the good, to unite with it, so that the lover, by contact with the beloved, that is, the good, may himself become good." 103 But the good must 96 Ibid.

COLISH be recognized as such before it can be desired by the will, that faculty of man which naturally tends toward it. Knowledge of the good must hence precede erotic desire; "before being loved, a thing must be known." 104 Man can identify the good only by virtue of the fact that the good introduces and manifests itself to him. The will has but to set out on the pathway of the good for the good "to approach it in order to embrace it, whence arises the desire for union." 105 Faith, man's response to this revelation, "will show what things ought to be loved.... " 106 God's abundant love for man cannot be confined to this one activity. After showing the will its proper object, it then "joyfully raises it as if on wings toward its good.... 1 107 Thus man returns to God in the same way he came forth from Him, the way of gratuitous grace. Playing every part assigned to him, signifying his heavenly longings by his own ability and volition, he can be robed in celestial garb and crowned with physical resurrection only through God's loving indulgence, in accordance with the divine plan. Although Vives sees piety, supernature, and the divine as discrete from prudence, nature, and humanity, he by no means holds that the one is irrelevant or unrelated to the other. The links between the two realms are forged by Vives' epistemology, which, like much of his theology, is fundamentally a Christianized Aristotelianism. Accordingly, he agrees that the knowledge of nature appropriate to man can be known inductively. The senses are the gateway of knowledge.'08 They cannot be deceived since they simply reflect the natural data they receive without judging them; and such data will not deceive the soul if the sense organ is healthy, if the natural object is close enough and stable enough to be perceived, if the medium through which it is perceived is clear, and if the spirit is attentive.109 Accurate data may thus be referred to the mind so that accurate general ideas may be formed about nature."10 This interest in precision does not stem from a purely scientific frame of mind; 104De anima et vita, III,iv.

Man must know nature because the works of creation proclaim the Creator."12 If his conception of the cosmos be distorted, man would misconstrue the nature of God. Vives sees the analogia entis less as a necessary ontological link between God and the world than as an expression of the harmony and benevolence with which God disposes His creation and draws it back to Himself. Even as man's spirit and body function in a comparable fashion,"13 so the operations of his soul reflect the activi- ties of God."4 All his potentialities are proportionate to their actu- alities; all his faculties correspond generically with their objects."5 Man has been granted a full range of innate aptitudes which are conducive to his natural and supernatural ends.1"6 Thus there exists a certain conformity between humanity and divinity, between pru- dence and piety, between the truths of reason and the truths of faith.""

COLISH of Pico are precisely those points at which his insights are informed by Scripture, the Church Fathers, and ecclesiastical tradition. Vives' final literary effort, barely completed before his death in 1540, is a work of Christian apology, conceived along conservative theological lines. The De veritate fidei Christianiae is rhetorical Thomism, but it is Thomism with a difference. While at no point diverging from Catholic doctrine, Christian apologetics witnesses in this tract a shift in emphasis at once striking and characteristic of the period. St. Thomas begins with the nature of God; Vives begins with the nature of man.121 God, to be sure, is the keystone of Vives' apology, but this is so because He functions, in the first instance, as the perfection and eternal end of man. Thus ethics rather than metaphysics com- mands Vives' prime attention, a point of view early crystallized in the Fabula. This is the philosophical orientation of all his later works, the motivating concern of the systematic treatise on human nature which he did not live to write. Many of his contemporaries share the mental inclinations of Vives; by no means do they all seek to compass their ethical quest in so fully, so devoutly, so explicitly orthodox a fashion. Vives' polygraphical talents, his erudition both wide and deep, his confident stylistic elegance evince beyond question his participa- tion in the humanistic tastes and predilections of his times. His conception of human dignity should not, however, be seen as nothing more-or less-than that of a third generation Florentine Platonist. He is fully capable of employing the vocabulary of Pico della Mirandola, but he uses it to express a different order of ideas, with fundamentally different ultimate concerns. Faced with the rich re- sources of Renaissance humanism, he develops a view of man more heavily weighted toward the Christian than the classical. That Vives alone adopts this particular arrangement of ideas on human nature as a guide amid the free-flowing and often turbulent emotional and intellectual currents of the time renders it no less important as an indication of the kind of effort which the time evoked and made possible. Set against the kaleidoscopic scene of Renaissance thought, Juan Luis Vives' philosophy of man forms a coherent, if evanescent, synthesis.
