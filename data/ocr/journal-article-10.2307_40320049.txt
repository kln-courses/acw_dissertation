<plain_text><page sequence="1">Laws of Nature, Rules of Conduct and their Analogy in Peirce's Semiotics* Helmut Pape "Anthropomorphic" is what pretty much all conceptions are at bottom; otherwise other roots for the words in which to express them than the old Aryan roots would have to be found. And in regard to any preference for one kind of theory over another, it is well to remember that every single truth of science is due to the affinity of the human soul to the soul of the universe, imperfect as that affinity no doubt is. To say, therefore, that a conception is one natural to man, which comes to just about the same thing as to say that it is anthropomorphic, is as high a recommendation as one could give in the eyes of an Exact Logician. (CP 5.474903)1 1. Nature and Semiosis: An Analogy Peirce's evolutionary philosophy of nature and cosmology, viewing nature as the evolution of mind, have not only been criticized - they have been made fun of or treated with contempt by important phi- losophers.2 W. B. Gallie described the situation appropriately when he said in Peirce and Pragmatism that Peirce's cosmology was looked at by most people as a sort of white elephant: Perhaps it exists, but why care about such a strange creature? Quite to the contrary, Peirce's logic and semiotics have been taken seriously, praised and discussed in and out of philosophy departments. But his semiotics and his philosophy of nature are in fact very closely connected. I don't think that we should ignore Peirce's hypothesis that such a connection exists. For what is philosophy good for, if it does not help us to understand those basic general connections be- tween man, the zoon symbolicon, and matter?</page><page sequence="2">210 Helmut Pape Here I am going to argue that "rule" or "regularity" and "law" in semiotics and in the philosophy of nature constitute, according to the interpretation given to them by Peirce, an interesting, that is, informa- tive analogy. I will endeavor to show that the analogy exhibits a part of the systematic unity of mind and matter which Peirce developed in his philosophy. It informs us that a law of nature can be understood as a successful strategy to deal with nature. And it goes on to tell us that just in this sense of habit or strategy a certain sequence of signs is ut- tered in a certain way because this accords well with another sort of strategy or habit which will enable us to communicate a certain con- tent. I will not discuss whether or not there are arguments from analogy with a special kind of validity. But I do think that there are good, i.e., informative analogies and metaphors: For one, philosophy can have no deductive structure. We have to use some analogies, if we want to con- vey new information about the world as a whole by relating it to some body of established knowledge in a number of varying instances. And, of course, some body of knowledge, if only the vague contents of our common and everyday orientation in this world, has to be presupposed as being established. But this common sense perspective closely relates instinct, reason and experience. It is the state from which we have to set out, if we want to gain an understanding of the world we find our- selves in which goes beyond a mere cognitive reaction to the arbitrary circumstances of our individual lives. However, almost all philosophers tell us that we can only do phi- losophy if we go beyond or beneath everyday experience and knowledge in some way or other - even if it needs some analysis of language or mathematics, properly applied, to do it correctly. What is unique about Peirce's methodological treatment of metaphors and analogies is his way of stressing that one term in all analogical transformation is con- stant: in experience it is a qualitative and monadic element expressed by some monadic predicates and by some metaphors; with regard to human conduct it is the influence of instinctive drives which is part and parcel of common sense orientations; and in our theoretical think- ing it is the anthropomorphic form of most of our hypotheses. Indeed, these three tenets taken together are the very core of Peirce's</page><page sequence="3">Peirce 's Semio tics 211 critical common-sensism and, on the methodological level, have to be taken as so many different forms which the logic of abduction has to account for. It is easy to misunderstand Peirce's theory of the anthropomorphic character of all our thought, because at first glance it seems rather irrational to defend such a thesis. For one, we might be tempted to think that endorsing anthropomorphisms is not a methodological thesis at all, but because of its irrationality, a denial of methodology in toto and a mystification of instinctive powers.3 But Peirce's thesis that all human thought has an anthropomorphic character4 is a rational thesis; it is even a methodological thesis if developed fully. It is a rational thesis, because in the wider context of Peirce's Critical Common-sensism it invites us to assess deliberately the extent to which the form of our thought is tinged, stanced or otherwise influenced by an anthropo- morphic mold. Only after such an assessment of what the anthropo- morphic character of our thought actually is can we say whether or not we should give it up for another, neutral concept. In a next step we should look at some cases in which the use of an anthropomorphic expression, our "law of nature" for example, seems to be appropriate. Is this phrase indeed limited to popular talk about science or may we use this metaphorical expression in philosophy? As always in philosophy the answer to this question has to combine systematic and historical considerations. This is the way Peirce in Ms 870 "What is a Law of Nature?" formulated our question: The question seems to be, not whether a word is metaphorical or not, but whether the fitness [of a] metaphor is confined to the analogies that suggested it, - other features of the fact, not thought of when the metaphor was invented are found to be equally harmonious with it. ... In order to answer that question it is plainly requisite to look into the history of the phrase so as to discover how men came to apply it as they now do, and what it was that they originally had in mind in doing so. (Ms 870, 1901; p. 6)5 According to Peirce, the use of an anthropomorphic metaphor is just- ified if</page><page sequence="4">212 Helmut Pape (i) the range of its application involves an important element of human conduct or thought, shown by historical facts about the use of the phrase in the past and by scientific evidence for the present, and (ii) the anthropomorphic expression conveys to us information about the topic it is applied to which otherwise might be overlooked or hard to get hold of. 2. Habits in a Chance World Albert Einstein when confronted with the indeterminacy in quantum mechanics is said to have denied its conceptual and ontological status by some remark like "God doesn't play dice." Einstein has done more than anybody else in the 20th century to change our views about the universe surrounding us, but on the issue of causation he adhered to the mechanistic conception depicting nature as the perfect machine governed by the unerring causal necessity of its laws. Quite to the contrary, Peirce's philosophy of nature is unique in the 19th century in allowing for a response to Einstein's remark which we may rephrase in a more colloquial, up-to-date version like this: "We don't know whether God is still playing the game, but around here, in this universe, we all had to learn to play all sorts of games in order to accommodate ourselves to matter, men, and animal." Not only indeterminancy but absolute chance was what Peirce believed in. In this paper I shall take the Einstein-Peirce contrast concerning the rationality and dignity of a statistical conception of nature as a starting point for the discussion of some topics which would otherwise be hard to understand although they are important for explaining why laws of nature and rules of conduct are so closely connected in Peirce's philo- sophy of nature as well as in his semiotics. I think that one may indeed say, in a somewhat loose manner, that it would accord well with Peirce's objective idealism, if we would regard ourselves as God's partners in a game. Only, the game is not dice - though time and again dice is Peirce's</page><page sequence="5">Peirce 's Semiotics 213 model - the game is called evolution: how a universe can grow out of a chaos of chance by adopting only those habits which allow us to stay alive and well. Einstein, when using the dice-metaphor, attacked the rationality as well as the metaphysical dignity of a world full of chance, aberrations and spontaneous fluctuations. In contrast to this, Peirce considered a statistical study of nature a promising research project. In 1878 in his paper "The Order of Nature" he constructed the model of a world where chance was depicted as the non-recurrence of a single combination of five ordered characters. With a few other assumptions he was able to show that even in such a world of chance distribution all sorts of regularities will evolve. But what about the theological significance of a chance world? In a late manuscript, Ms 478 (1903), Peirce develops an argument pointing out the different sort of theological dignity which accrues to a world left in an undetermined state by its creator but which becomes more and more determined. Now Peirce's argument runs like this. Even if we suppose that the creator of the universe is a most perfect being, who manifests himself by creating this universe, it does not follow that it is more rational and more dignified to create something completely and perfectly determined. For to create something perfectly finished in every respect is to create a sort of copy of God's own nature: A realization of the perfect plan its creator had in mind. Such a universe would be unable to change in any minute detail, even if it were for the worse, because its perfection depends upon its reflexive relation to God. Obviously, the history of such a universe would end in the very moment when the act of creation were completed. For this reason, if God acts as a creator, he will create a universe whose character and fate is independent of God's perfection. Indeed, since his being a creator is essential to God, he has to desire that his creation be independent and even opposed to himself. So we have at least this one argument combining a possible development of a more regular, and that means more rational, structure of physical processes with God's creation of a chaotic chance universe which will produce its own line of development. Peirce's general line of argument in his own words:</page><page sequence="6">214 Helmut Pape The fault of "Substance and Shadow" is that it represents the desire of God to confer independence upon that which is most opposite to himself to be a special peculiarity of God. But God has no whimsys nor pet weaknesses: it is on the contrary the essential nature of Purpose that it cannot be directed toward itself but develops itself in Creating. The Representation is directed towards its object into rationaliza- tion, making a statue out of a stone, the Thought accomplish- es itself. (Ms 478, alternative draft, pp. 19-20) In sum, this is the anti-Einsteinian theological underpinning of Peirce's evolutionary cosmology: creation, or the realization of a purpose is only possible, where we have an independent process of growth not necessitated by God's act of creation. But let us scrutinize Peirce's concept of chance and its role in his philosophy of nature more closely. In 1884 we find him describing chance as a productive factor in the cosmologica! eveolution: You have all heard of the dissipation of energy. It is found that in all transformations of energy a part is converted into heat and heat is always tending to equalize its temperature. The consequence is that the energy of the universe is tending by virtue of its necessaary laws toward a death of the universe in which there shall be no force but heat and the temperature everywhere the same . . . But although no force can counteract this tendency, chance may and will have the opposite influence. Force is in the long run dissipative; chance is in the long run concentra tive. The dissipation of energy by the regular laws of nature is by these very laws accompanied by circumstances more and more favorable to its re-concentration by chance. There must there- fore be a point at which the two tendencies are balanced and that is no doubt the actual condition of the whole universe at the present time. (Ms 875, "On Natural Law and Chance," 1844, pp. 29-31)</page><page sequence="7">Peirce 's Semio tics 215 But is it not a disgrace and degradation of scientific rationality to con- ceive laws of nature as only so many "reconcentrations by chance"? It will strike even the contemporary philosopher of science and nature as a remarkable though problematic achievement that Peirce, when confronted with a challenge of the rationality of his notion of causal- ity, ends up by demonstrating that the model of evolving games or dialogues with nature is the more rational one. But he does so in a very effective way by urging two general arguments. The first step is Peirce 's argument that we need a totally different sort of explanation, if we want to formulate a cosmological hypothesis within the range of a philosophy of nature. With regard to the extension of matter in time and space our cosmology is the most general theory that we can formulate in a philosophy of nature. This is the reason why we need an evolutionary explanation of theories, laws and regular- ities, if we want to gain a cosmological understanding of them.6 One might be tempted to say, using contemporary terminology, that Peirce advanced a research program in which not only epistemology but also physics is to be naturalized. In 1893 he defended this methodological aspect of his cosmology in his reply to Paul Cams' criticism: If an evolutionary explanation is to be adopted, philosophy, logic, and the economy of research all dictate that in the first essay, at least, that style of explanation be carried as far back as explanation is called for. What elements of the universe required no explanation? . . . Being, and the uniformity in which being consists, require to be explained. The only thing that does not require it is non-existent spontaneity. This was soon seen to mean absolute chance. The conclu- sion so reached was clinched by a careful reexamination of the office of chance in science generally, and especially in the doctrines of evolution. (CP 6.604, 1893, "Reply to the Necessitarians") This approach to cosmology links the quest for an explanation of the laws of nature depicted as products of a universal development with the assumption of an element of absolute chance which cannot be ex- plained in this fashion. But why is chance equated with "non-existent</page><page sequence="8">216 Helmut Pape spontaneity"? Whereas relative chance is chance only with regard to the amount of information about the causes we take into considera- tion, absolute chance is a violation of a law of nature, even if it occurs only to an infinitesimal degree and on excessively rare occasions. Now existence, e.g., of an individual object, is a rather general property, because it consists - according to Peirce - in "the resultant genuine dyadic relation of a strict individual with all the other such individuals of the same universe" (5.336, 1909). 7 But since an event is said to happen absolutely by chance, because there was no cause for it to happen and since the absence of a property, in this case "having a cause to happen," does not constitute a genuine dyadic relation, it makes sense to say that an event happening by absolute chance does not exist. If such an event takes place, it is always an exception, an aberration from a law of nature and it is, therefore, adequate to call it "spontane- ous." But will it not lead us straight into a contradiction both to assume a state of affairs governed by absolute chance and then go on to explain causally determinate laws as evolving out of it?8 Peirce foresaw this objection to his method arguing that no causally determinate law could ever possibly be explained as the result of a state of affairs governed by absolute chance. On the contrary, the only uniformity characteriz- ing a state of affairs in which absolute chance was prevalent is the fact that there were no determinate laws at all (cf. 6.609ff.). Instead, courses of events governed by absolute or relative chance come to be governed by another type of law, which is a statistical result or "law of habit," as Peirce calls it. That is, Peirce assumes a weak type of law limiting the spontaneity of events, and fortuitous distribution of matter is ac- quired by the initial chaos. But this already leads us to the second part of the argument. Toward understanding Peirce's second argument, we can draw on what we found out about absolute chance, namely, that it doesn't exist, in a general sense of existence, so that it doesn't follow that an indi- vidual thing's existence could ever be due to absolute chance. For the crucial consideration in Peirce's evolutionary philosophy of nature is that the existence of events by absolute chance is not itself an absolute chance but is, rather, governed by some weak statistical laws operating</page><page sequence="9">Pence's Semiotics 217 even in the initial stage. In this second move Peirce explicates ten- dencies towards what we normally call a law of nature as the "habits" of matter developed in the course of time. But if matter acquires in this way the ability to exclude absolute chance of events, it will have a "general tendency toward the formation of habits, toward repeating reactions that had already taken place under like circumstances" (NEM, Vol. IV, p. 140). It is obvious that the concept of habit is formative by mediating a stage where only individual events exist by absolute chance and a uni- verse of law and structure. The question is, whether the concept of habit can bear out the task Peirce assigned to it. The answer is hard to make out. But let us stick to our insight that absolutely arbitrary events don't exist in the sense in which individual things do. If a tendency to repeat a certain reaction is enforced, the sequence of events dis- criminates past, present and future. The system of events has started an irreversible development in time, because its future reactions will depend, to some degree, on its past reactions. By the same token the isolation of the individual event is gone - there must exist some regu- larities and therefore individual things (CP. 6.72 or 1.348). Let us accept this step from the isolated events to the existence of things for the time being. Still a universe filled with individual particles all behaving, once in a while, in a regular way, that is, as they did before, is a rather strange universe when compared with the one we know. Peirce needs a much stronger antidote against chance. Indeed Peirce claims for the law of habit - which he sometimes describes as a process of general- ization - a very strong reflexive property which would be regarded by many a modern logician as the original sin in logic. But Peirce saw no vicious circle involved when he enlarged his conception of habit by the concept of a self-controlled growth of habit: "A habit of acquiring habits began to be established, and a habit of strengthening the habit of acquiring habits . . ." (NEM, Vol. IV, p. 140). Is the concept of a self-controlled habit indeed circular? And if not, are we justified in calling a habit a statistical law? The concept of self- organization or self-generation of systems keeping their structure con- stant throughout is in contemporary science, in thermodynamics and biology, a hotly debated subject. It is indeed very fascinating to see</page><page sequence="10">218 Helmut Pape that we can use the same set of kinetical equations to describe, e.g., a cycle of autocatalytical chemical reactions and a cycle of interacting species of animals in an ecological system. And, what is more to the point, Manfred Eigen developed in his The Hypercycle: A Principle of Natural Self-Organization a model to explain the genesis of life as the evolution of macromolecules acquiring the ability of self-organization. Of course, I am not going to use these notions concerning the concept of self-organization as evidence for Peirce's hypothesis that the acquisi- tion of habits is the crucial principle of cosmic evolution. But what we can learn from these theories is under what conditions a reflexive property may be part of a reasonable, i.e., a non-circular hypothesis. Namely, in all the theories we describe the morphology of evolving structures of systems existing in space and time. A system, e.g., of molecules or cells, is said to be a self-organizing one, because it is cap- able of controlling some sequence of changes which will usually happen in contact with its environment. If there is a drastic change in the environmental conditions a system either will be doomed or it will be able to accomodate the altered conditions, in Peirce's terminology, "the breaking up of a habit" (CP 6.264nl). My conclusion is that if habit is the ability of a system to control the changes brought about in interaction with its environment, then this ability involves a highly com- plex property of the system, but to assume such a property implies no paradox of self-reference. In fact, it is not a strictly self-referential property like, e.g., the class of all classes which do not contain them- selves. It is based on simple assumptions like, e.g., "habits control the changes of a system" and "for the process of habit-taking of a system diversification does not antedate all time!" (CP 6.65, 1892). On the other hand, the self-organization of a system by some habits based on previous reactions must be indeed like statistical law. For even in a highly uniform environment no two events of interaction with the environment will be exactly alike. Therefore, a habit to react in a certain way is successful, if and only if it is adequate to some degree in the majority of cases. In sum, we can reconstruct Peirce's account of habit- taking insofar as it explains the capacity of matter to build up types of local order by means of the atoms and molecules acquiring strategies of behavior which preserve their form self-genera tively:</page><page sequence="11">Peirce 's Semiotics 219 . . .all things have tendency to take habits. For atoms and their parts, molecules and groups of molecules, and in short every conceivable real object, there is a greater probability of acting as on a former like occasion than otherwise. This tendency itself constitutes a regularity, and it is continu- ally on the increase ... It is a generalizing tendency; it causes actions in the future to follow some generalization of past actions; and this tendency is itself something capable of similar generalizations; and thus is self-generative. (CP 1.409, 1890) Clearly, even if one remains doubtful about the cosmologica! hypoth- esis that all matter and all laws of nature developed in such a way, one salient aspect of Peirce's account is that the habits of matter are con- structed like strategies in a game insofar as only those strategies will survive which stabilize a result allowing the respective class of players to repeat their course of action. In this way, in the long run a chance setting favors only those habits or strategies which are performed in reaction to the largest possible range of chance occurrences. The game metaphor is, by no means, an arbitrary exemplificaton of how the process of habit-taking may work. This model supplies an explanation both for the cumulative effect of the development of habits strengthening the acquisition of habits and the force of its dynamic. The kind of game chosen as a model for the development of self- organizing systems is always a finite zero-sum game, that is, a sort of game in which the rules determine a definite result in a finite number of steps. By tacitly assuming that the resources of the players enabling them to continue the game are unlimited, or at least very large, Peirce assimilates his game-model to the sort of open system life on earth is an example of. I will again take the liberty of quoting an unpublished passage of some length which brings out the close connection between habit- taking and the game-model: The main element of habit is the tendency to repeat any action which has been performed before. It is a phenomenon at least coextensive with life, and it may cover a still wider</page><page sequence="12">220 Helmut Pape real realm. Imagine a large number of systems in some of which there is a decided tendency toward doing what has once been done, in others elements having one tendency and elements having the other. Let us consider the effects of chance upon these different systems. To fix our ideas suppose players playing with dice, some of their dice are worn down in such a way that the act of losing tends to make them lose again, others in such a way that the act of losing tends to make them win. The latter will win or lose much more slowly, yet after a sufficient length of time they will be in danger of being ruined and destroyed. Those whose dice are so worn as to reproduce the same effects, will be divided into two parts, one of which will quietly be destroyed, the other made strong- er and stronger. For every kind of an organism, system, form, or compound, there is an absolute limit to a weakening pro- cess. It ends in destruction; there is no limit to strength of the objects remaining. Systems or compounds which have bad habits are quickly destroyed, those which have no habits follow the same course; only those which have good habits tend to survive. (Ms 875, "On Natural Law and Chance," pp. 23-25) We will now simply stop our examination of Peirce's thesis that laws of nature are habits growing in a chance world. We will assume that this is a reasonable hypothesis to defend in a philosophy of nature for it leads to the recognition of some interesting properties of physical pro- cesses which are hard to account for in any other way. Nevertheless, it is still open to us to ask, whether this conception of physical pro- cesses is consistent with his realism, especially with Peirce's realistic interpretation of scientific concepts and theories. Obviously enough, what is dealt with in a scientific theory is a part of reality, if the theory is true. But the real is that which is independent of what you or I or any finite number of men might think about it. Therefore, all theories and laws of nature that we might formulate and base our experiments upon are laws about entities independent of what we think about them. But the same independence does not hold good for the type of entity,</page><page sequence="13">Peirce 's Semiotics 221 namely actions, those rules of conduct with which we are concerned in everyday life and in science. How I will act depends on what I think would be the best thing for me to do relative to my norms, aims and the circumstances under which I have to act. If my acts do not depend on what I think about them, what else does? The analogy between laws of nature and rules of conduct seems to break down even before it can be developed fully semiotically. But the situation is, of course, not as bad as it looks. Two avenues are open to us, if we want to rescue our analogy. For one, we may suppose: I. All laws of nature are in the first place determined by the aims, norms, and interests governing our conduct towards nature. This is the kind of relativistic thesis which many people are eager to equate with a pragmatistic outlook on nature. Relative to the way we interpret the force and degree of dependence between the ideological package of aims, norms, and interests on the one hand and nature on the other, the thesis will become part and parcel of a thoroughgoing relativ- ism, comprising all sorts of "Lebensphilosophie." The modern locus clas- sicus is Nietzsche's skeptical epistemology. In some of his remarks Niet- zsche argues that all our knowledge is just a disguise for what was once an instinctive drive in, e.g., a flock of sheep. At first glance Peirce seems to argue in a similar vein by stressing the anthropomorphic quality of human knowledge which has its point of departure in common sense and in instinctive knowledge. Our mind and some of our basic skills as well as our basic knowledge about motion, space and time are innate, products of the successful endeavor to survive in this universe. But we have survived, because all these habits contain a huge amount of correct understanding of reality. That is, Peirce defends the view that a good adaptation to a physical environment cannot but result in an instinctive knowledge approximating a true conception of the surrounding universe: General consideration concerning the universe, strictly phi- losophical considerations, all but demonstrate that if the universe conforms, with any approach to accuracy, to certain</page><page sequence="14">222 Helmut Pape highly pervasive laws, and if man's mind has been developed under the influence of those laws, it is to be expected that he should have a natural light, or light of nature, or instinctive insight, or genius tending to make him guess those laws aright, or nearly aright. (CP 5.604, 1904) If we want to stick to a realistic interpretation of the theories and concepts of science, the analogy between laws of nature and habits becomes feasible on the condition that we adopt a second thesis: II. All adaptive and, in the long run, successful rules of conduct are developed in interaction with a level of reality in such a way that in everyday experience and scientific experiment reality is an independent variable acting as a regulative ideal which all true opinions, theories and laws of nature approx- imate to some degree. According to Thesis II, we can explain why Peirce put such an emphasis on common sense, everyday experience, instinctive drives and their cognitive counterpart, the anthropomorphic hypothesis. These are, in their range of application, the "winning strategies" tested for many a generation. And we should not let them go without a definite and decisive reason, but should stick to them as long as possible. Even in science and in philosophy we are well advised to choose deliberately the anthropomorphic hypothesis in all cases where decisive reasons for other types of hypotheses are missing: . . . indubitable beliefs refer to a somewhat primitive mode of life, and that, while they never become dubitable in so far as our mode of life remains that of somewhat primitive man, yet as we develop degrees of self-control unknown to that man, occasions of action arise in relation to which the or- iginal beliefs, if stretched to cover them, have no sufficient authority. (5.511, ca. 1905)</page><page sequence="15">Peirce 's Semiotics 223 At this point we can see a consequence of Peirce's concept of habits in a chance world: The growth of knowledge as well as that of human societies is built upon the circumstance that in this universe we have the chance to develop all sorts of fruitful, reproducible courses of action, habits, and rules of conduct, if we are able to develop them in the face of changing circumstances, thereby outwitting, in the long run, chance itself. 3. Laws of Nature What we have to do next is to give a general account of "law of nature" and then go on to see what the role of this conception in semiotics might amount to. For our first purpose the Ms "What is a Law of Nature?" will supply us with the answers we need. In this Ms Peirce argues that beyond all the differences between the various instances of laws of nature there is one general character they all share: . . .there is, however, one character which all truths called laws of nature possess in common and it is a character that ought never to be lost sight of, it is the best guide to right inductions! It is that every proposition called a law of nature can serve and does serve, as basis for predictions. (Ms 870, p. 3) This character, upon which we will build our analogy, relates to a prob- lematic ontological circumstance, their being in futuro, which both human conduct and laws of nature exhibit. The predictive meaning of laws of nature has been acknowledged by the majority of contemporary philosophers of science - from Popper and Mary Hesse to Quine and Norwood Russell Hanson - as an important property of science and its laws. For obvious reasons the analogy between rule and laws of nature was not considered to be important. Some people dealing with rules even denied the analogy by claiming that we cannot base predictions on our knowledge of rules of conduct, because they allow for exceptions. In her book Rules (Den Haag, 1971), J. S. Ganz, for example, arrives at the conclusion that "There can be no predictive value to rules" (p. 66).</page><page sequence="16">224 Helmut Pape This is, of course, the position I have to attack. For to build the analogy Peirce and I have to suppose that a rule-based prediction has a predictive meaning even if it is successful only in the majority or in an important subclass of the instances considered. Somebody may act according to a certain rule of conduct but not always; a certain type of event may occur regularly according to a certain law of nature, but not in some borderline cases. What, then, is the predictive meaning of rules and laws? For our purposes we will highlight a rather special version of this property: (1) All laws of nature and rules of conduct have a predictive value insofar as they enable us to predict situations which occur regularly and in which certain kinds of events or acts take place. Two other results are obtainable from the Ms "What is a Law of Nature?" and these are of some importance: (2) All through the middle ages and also for the ancient phi- losophers the phrase "law of nature" has generally been understood as the moral instinct or the moral law of con- sciousness of men set up by nature or by God in creating nature. But always a law of nature was considered to de- scribe the order of nature (ordo naturae) in relation to human conduct. (3) In the history of philosophy, up to the time of Descartes, almost all the different concepts which approached our notion of a law of nature were generally conceived of as admitting exceptions, at least in some borderline cases. (Peirce observes in passing that Heraclitus is one of the few philosophers whose concept of the order of nature does not permit exceptions.) The above results are not only interesting observations about the history of the notion of "law of nature" or "ordo naturae" but also serve as data for Peirce's philosophy of nature. The history of science was</page><page sequence="17">Peirce fs Semiotics 225 studied by Peirce as a systematic discipline in the hope of gaining "an understanding of the whole logic of every pathway to the truth" (Ms 1269). In respect to all three results Peirce is preparing the ground for urg- ing the independence of the determinista thesis that laws of nature don't allow exceptions and are absolutely valid from that other char- acterization that they help us to predict future events. Whether determinist or indeterminist, we want to say that a law of nature is that which allows us to predict future events to some extent, and this is what (1) suggests. Therefore, if we were going to analyze the laws of nature formulated in the sciences from the point of view of a philosophy of nature seeking the general character of the universe, it is the possibility of predicting future events which will supply us with an important datum: It shows us that there is a stratum of regularity in nature represented by our successful predictions. That is, the reality of laws of nature are so many successful ways of dealing with nature, rela- tive to a limited, though always expanding, range of interaction with the physical processes of the surrounding universe. The task designated by Peirce for a philosophy of nature is not the quest for "ultimate foundations" or for an omnipotent methodology but a sort of inquiry into the possible future developments of science. Therefore, it is important to estimate also the extent of our ignorance manifest in scientific knowledge in order to prevent a philosophy of nature from becoming a mildly generalized version of the latest the- ories of science. In asking, "the general fact that there are laws, how is that to be explained?" in Ms 875, Peirce was attacking the determin- istic conception of nature as being governed by absolutely precise laws and at least one of his reasons for doing this was his insight that it was not our knowledge but our ignorance concerning this universe which is unlimited: The forces we know can be but a small part of all those that are operative. Our ignorance of small things and great, of distant times and of very slow operations. We are equally ignorant of very rapid performances which nevertheless we know to take place. Our science is altogether middle-sized</page><page sequence="18">226 Helmut Pape and mediocre. Its insignificance compared with the universe cannot be exaggerated. (6.119, "History of Science," 1896) In sum, Peirce's criticism of the 19th century views that, (a) science will be completed soon, and (b) that the laws of nature are determining absolutely, enabled him to construct the analogy between laws of nature and rules of conduct in the following fashion: Not only semiotical rules can be viewed as "statistical facts" - that is, as what we nowadays understand in terms of conventions in language games - regulating the verbal interaction of an indefinite multitude of people in a successful way but also laws of nature in the sciences, e.g., in physics and chemistry. As far as I can tell, Peirce's guesses are confirmed by the results in the thermodynamics of irreversible processes. Ilya Prigogine, for example, describes in his books statistical laws governing the dynamic instability of chemical processes. This is the development Peirce was expecting when in 1884 he wrote: Certain laws of nature, laws of Bovle and Charles, the Second law of thermodynamics, and some others are known to be results of chance - statistical facts so to say ... I cannot help believing that more of the molecular laws - the principles of chemistry for example - will be found to involve the same element - especially as almost all these laws present the same peculiarity of not being rigidly exact. (Ms 875, "Design and Chance," p. 31) This is neither the time nor the place to develop Peirce's philosophy of nature in relation to contemporary physics. I have only taken the liberty of drawing attention to this topic, because it has rarely been taken into consideration when Peirce was pronounced guilty of pro- ducing a cloud of vague concepts in which a correct understanding of terms like "law of nature" inevitably got lost. In building up the analogy between laws of nature and rules of conduct</page><page sequence="19">Peirce fs Semiotics 227 in this way one has to come to terms with the common and well-founded opinion that habits are acquired in a process of learning or by another type of acquisition and may be lost again by conscious efforts to resist the force of habitual repetition. According to this common sense opin- ion it does not make sense to say, e.g., that bodies have acquired the habit of attracting one another inversely to the square of their distance. But if the laws of nature are indeed statistical facts, we can interpret them, contrary to common sense, as laws acquired in the course of an irreversible development which is still going on : May not the laws of physics be habits gradually acquired by systems? Why, for instance, do the heavenly bodies tend to attract one another? Because in the long run bodies that repel or do not attract will get thrown out of the region of space leaving only the mutually attracting bodies. Why do they attract inversely as the square of the distance? This may be only their average law of attraction. (Ms 875, p. 26) 4. Laws and Rules in Peirce 's Semiotics It seems to be easy to describe the semiotical part of the analogy in terms of Peirce's philosophy: The rules of conduct are to a large extent manifest in consciously adopted habits governing our once and future conduct. But what else is habit than a mental tendency or disposition to repeat any action which has been performed before? That is, if we know the habits of a person, including his linguistic and semiotical habits, we know what his future acts will be, given certain circumstances to which the habits relate. We will now investigate how exactly the anal- ogy is applied in Peirce's semiotics. That is, we will look for a type of sign which is both used according to deliberately adopted rules of conduct and relates to other types of signs whose functioning as a sign is not exclusively determined by such rules. In modern biology some people, when describing living beings with regard to the multiplicity of systemic properties, speak about them in terms of a hierarchy of systems, one more specialized and refined than the other, but using the more primitive ones as starting points. This</page><page sequence="20">228 Helmut Pape has been called the "order-on-order" principle in living beings. Something closely similar to this holds for the way in which the linguistic sign-functions form so many different levels of representation with the higher level presupposing the more primitive ones. For Peirce, the symbol is a sign-function which exhibits such a cumulative effect. Symbols are used to perform a sophisticated sign function which oper- ates upon a range of interactional values. In the most paradigmatic and universal case the symbolic forms of a language are all the complete propositions building upon and comprising indexical and iconical constituents without being reducible to them. In Ms 478 we find a definition of the symbol where Peirce explicitly states the analogy between laws of nature and rules of conduct by making use of our property (1), the predictive power of laws of nature: A symbol is a sign whose significant character consists in the fact that it will be so interpreted. Take the word 'owl' for example ... in everyday use, the only reason the word is to communicate the idea is that the speaker is certain that it will be so interpreted. It is the same with every word and sentence of speech. Now a certainty that something will be so and so is of the nature of what we in physics call a law. It can be only true of something which can recur again and again, indefinitely. . . . These recurrences exist, but the sym- bol itself regulates their existence. We are now in a position to say, with the help of the analogy, what, in general, the knowledge of symbols as laws of communicational inter- action amounts to: to know a symbol is to know under what circum- stances replicas of the symbol will be interpreted correctly. 5. Iconical Content and Indexical Structure of Semiotical Habits The relation between symbol, index and icon in our semiotical habits was said to be governed by an order-on-order principle to the effect that every symbol will contain an index and an icon of some sort. In-</page><page sequence="21">Peirce 's Semiotics 229 dices and icons, symbolically contained, are apt to show, in addition to their genuine way of signification, the typical feature which the symbol containing them exhibits. For example the demonstrative pronouns T, 'here', and 'now' are used on the assumption that their interpreta- tion is, at least to some degree, an established fact within a community of people using those signs. Or, to use Peirce 's terminology, they are degenerate indices or icons, because a symbolical feature is added to their semiotical character which is not part of their definition as signs sui generis. This fusion of sign-functions takes place in every dicisign as well as in every proposition. Peirce takes a proposition to be a species of dicisign which is a symbol whose utterance (replica) is interpreted to contain a (degenerate) index of an object as its subject-term and a (degenerate) icon as its predicate-term. In cases where semiosis starts with something perceived we have sometimes an icon acting as the qualitative content of the object or the fact indicated. Now a proposi- tion, which always refers to an indefinite number of instances, cannot represent a perceptual fact, but a replica of it in a sentence can do this. In one of Peirce 's favorite examples, the sentence "This is an indenta- tion by a human foot" may represent the symbolic structure of a dici- sign in which the fusion of icon and index is particularly strong: Decisigns are either symbols, when they become genuine prop- sitionSj or they are informational indices. Almost all indices are either informational or they are elements of informational indices. Thus, when Robinson Crusoe found the footprint generally spoken of as Friday's, we suppose that his attention was first attracted to an indentation of the sand. So far it was a mere substitutive index, a mere something apparently a sign for something else. But on examination he found that "there was the print of toes, heel, and every part of a foot", in short, an icon converted into an index; and the connection of this with its presence on the shore, could only be inter- preted as an index of a corresponding presence of a man. (Ms 478, from an alternative draft, 1903)</page><page sequence="22">230 Helmut Pape My purpose now is to investigate in what way the iconica! and the indexical components of a dicisign and a proposition contribute to the predictive meaning of the proposition or dicisign. The distinction between icon, index and symbol is, of course, the semantical part of Peirce's semiotic, because it differentiates three types of relations a sign might have to its object. Peirce's semiotic of the object-relation is unique in that it links the semiotic al-syntac tic al features of a sign to its semantical features. By prescribing the qualities of its tokens, a symbol of a certain type will be tantamount to a convention to the ef- fect that every single token is formed in accordance with a rule of formation. The uniformity of formation is exemplified by the indi- vidual token, inducing the interpreter, who, of course, has to know this type of symbol to think of objects correctly: We speak of writing or pronouncing the word "man"; but it is only a replica, or embodiment of the word, that is pro- nounced or written ... It is a general mode of succession of three sounds or representamens of sounds, which becomes a sign only in the fact that a habit, or acquired law, will cause replicas of it to be interpreted as meaning a man or men. The word and its meaning are both general rules; but the word alone of the two prescribes the qualities of its rep- licas in themselves. (CP 2.292, 1903, from Ms 478) As we already saw, the function of a symbol depends on a conventional fact, on the fact that our audience will understand it correctly regardless of the context. In contrast to this, the crucial property required by an index cannot be made subject of a convention, because it is a/acf about an existential relation to the object indicated. The crucial property of the index, its "significant character" as Peirce sometimes calls it, is a fact about the world and it is a mere accident that we use this fact as sign. But because we proposed to defend the order-on-order principle the question arises: how is it possible for an indicating fact to be subjected to a symbolic convention in such a manner as to contribute to the pre- dictive meaning of a more complex sign? Clearly, the index does not</page><page sequence="23">Peirce 's Semiotics 23 1 have nor need to have a predictive meaning, but it must at least be com- patible with the predictive meaning of the proposition. The answer to our question comes forward rather easily, if we take into account a second property that - according to Peirce - all indices have. First of all, all genuine indices are very prominent features of their respective environments and they are used (or produced) just because they "stick out." In Ms 478 (alternative draft) Peirce gives the example of a taxi driver, who shouts "Hi, there": "(the very event, when it takes place) considered as simply calling attention to him is an index." And this is the answer to our question: Devise a conventional com- plement for an index in such a way that (a) the object to be indicated is present in a situation; and (b) the utterance of a sound expressing the co-presence of a certain ontological category will direct the attention of the interpreter to this object. Then because of (a) and (b), we will be able to predict that the interpreter will identify the object indicated, if the degenerate index is placed in the position of a subject term in a sentence. We may formulate Peirce 's semantico-semiotical contrast of symbol and index in the following fashion: (i) While the sign-function of the symbol is based on an assumption about the behavior of all possible interpreters, i.e., that all the ob- jects of the tokens will be understood by all the interpreters in much the same way as the utterer understands them; (ii) the sign-function of an index assumes that the behavior of the person uttering a token thereby tries to call the attention of the interpreter to something present, i.e., that the utterer directs the possible interpreter to identify the object the sentence is about.9 But what about the icon's contribution to the predictive meaning of a proposition? The icon seems to be kind of neutral when it comes to a rule-oriented distinction which takes different ways of coming to know an object of a proposition for utterer and interpreter for granted. In- stead, in communication the idea symbolized by "... is blue" is an icon that constitutes a sort of "common consciousness" (Ms 318, Prag. 33) of utterer and intepreter, although they are going to do different things with it: for there is the immediate object of a statement which is</page><page sequence="24">232 Helmut Pape an "apprehension in the intention of the utterer" (ibid., Prag. 41) which differs from an "image, or notion in the mind of the interpreter before the sign is uttered" {ibid., Ms 218, Prag. 17). Nevertheless, it is the same "immediate object," for example, a red rose in a garden which both the utterer and the interpreter confront, which gives rise to just one "idea the sign is built upon" (ibid., Prag. 33) in the idea of a red rose. In sum, though there is one idea of a red rose, we are still able to distinguish the specific contribution of this idea in respect to the participation of utterer and interpreter in some simple piece of com- municational exchange. The following diagram makes explicit how people normally cooperate to establish the immediate object they speak about: common consciousness: "the idea the sign is built upon" (Ms 318, Prag. 33) utterer: interpreter: apprehension in the "image, or notion in the intention of the mind of the interpreter utterer" before the sign is uttered" (Ms 318, Prag 41) (Ms 318, Prag. 17) "immediate object" or "the object as it is represented in the sign" (NEM, Vol. Ill, p. 886) According to its definition an icon signifies its object, because the sign exhibits a quality which it might have in common with its object, if such an object exists. But the existence of the object is not required for the</page><page sequence="25">Peirce 's Semiotics 233 icon having this significant character. Therefore, the iconical component of a more complex symbolical sign has at least no definite bearings on either the predictions about the interpreter's apprehension of the ob- jects described or on the way the utterer directs the attention of an interpreter to an object. The theory of the directive meaning of indexical expressions10 was developed by Peirce in 1893, when he tried to give a definition of what exactly the role of the indicating pronouns of our language is. In a Ms called "The Short Logic" he wrote: A pronoun ought to be defined as a word which may indicate anything to which the first and second persons have suitable real connections, by calling the attention of the second person to it. (CP2.287nl) What Peirce here called "real connections," to which the attention of interpreter or "second person" is called, are the real connections to the object intended to be identified by the interpreter who follows the leads the indices provide. Note that the concept of "attention" is understood by Peirce in a rather special sense, which includes a per- son's thinking and remembering as a necessary mental context for any relevant perceptions, i.e., the ones triggered by grasping the import of the token, and contributing iconically to an understanding of the whole sentence. The important thing here is that the attention of the Interpreter is directed to a present situation, because the utterance of the index builds upon an iconical consciousness which is, for the people com- municating, a range of "common experience". In a passage written in 1903 Peirce described the intersubjectivity of a common iconical con- siousness on which the use and understanding of an index relies: But if one person is to convey any information to another it must be upon the basis of common experience. They must not only have this common experience, but each must know the other has it; and not only that but each must know the other knows he has it, and must know the other knows that he</page><page sequence="26">234 Helmut Pape knows the other has it; so that when one says "it is cold" the other may know that he does not mean that it is cold in Iceland or in Laputa, but right here. In short it must be thoroughly understood between them that they are talking about objects of a^collection with which both have some familiarity. (NEM, Vol. Ill, 1, p. 407, 1976) For some people talking, their consciousness of what they know and perceive in a given situation results in an iconical consciousness of an object, i.e., an idea. This is simply the state of mind from which they have to set out in their communication, because it is the state they find themselves in. Therefore, the immediate object of communication serves as a starting point in very much the same way in which the in- stinctive beliefs of common sense serve this function for all scientific investigations. In the icon of an immediate object Critical Common- sensism finds its semiotical counterpart. Admittedly, there are some types of icons we should go on to dis- cuss here. The degenerate icons and indices which are part of symbolic forms may sometimes play an important role in formal logic and math- ematics. But an adequate discussion of their peculiar semiotical pro- perties would require that we bring much of the work Peirce did in the semiotics of logic, especially with regard to his graphical logic, and in the semiotics of mathematics into the scope of our investigation.11 But what we can do is to relate our findings about the icon to the semantico-semiotical contrasts between indices and symbols in a dia- gram which exhibits some of the similarities between semiotical classi- fications, logical forms relative to a linguistic example: Linguistic Example Semiotical Category Logical Form Communication al Role [&lt;. . . is red" Icon Fx Neutral Content "This is red" Index (Ex)Fx Direction "All roses are red" Symbol (x) (Fx DGx) Prediction</page><page sequence="27">Pence's Semiotics 235 6. Conclusion Linguistic communication begins with the indication of that part of reality we will communicate about. But even this first step of identify- ing the immediate object of our communicational exchange depends both on the linguistic and on the non-linguistic parts of the situation. One way of putting it, indices coordinate linguistic behavior and cog- nitive activities of the people communicating in relation to some icon- ical features of the world, thereby constituting a common consciousness. Although the directive meaning of the index is part of the meaning of a symbolic form, it will relate us to what cannot be symbolized, to a possible future co-presence of a token with the object and the people communicating in some situation. What is philosophically important about Peirce's semiotic is not only the idea of a general theory of signs or "physiology of forms" (Ms 478) which does the job which in traditional philosophy epistemology was assigned. More important and substantial than that is the idea of making lawful, or establishing regularity in the way signs will be interpreted, the most comprehensive feature of all our ways of relating signs to their objects. Only insofar as physical processes are predictable do they ex- hibit for us an anthropomorphic quality. That is, they are similar to human conduct in all those cases where we do know the habits govern- ing them. Therefore, if semiosis opens up new ways of dealing with nature, symbols enable us to find a rule-governed determination of objects, indices provide the directions for finding out which one of these objects is actually present (cf. 2.230, 1903), and icons tell us what this object will possibly be like. The predictive meaning of symbolic forms helps us to predict future events and directs our actions in accordance with our aims. The anticipation of possible future actions characterizes all important knowledge about man and his world. Small wonder that for Peirce the increase of knowledge about possible courses of actions is the crucial function of all signs: It appears to me that the essential function of a sign is to render inefficient relations efficient, - not to set them into</page><page sequence="28">236 Helmut Pape action, but to establish a habit or general rule whereby they will act on occasion. According to the physical doctrine, no- thing ever happens but the rectilinear velocities with the ac- celerations that accompany different relative positions of the particles. All other relations, of which we know so many, are inefficient. Knowledge in some way renders them effi- cient; and a sign is something by knowing which we know something more. (Semiotics and Signifies: The Correspon- dence Between C. S. Peirce and Lady Welby, ed. C. S. Hard- wick, 1977, pp. 31-32) Peirce's monistic approach in semiotics has a number of interesting consequences. For one, we should expect that, if we add the general definition of a sign to the icon-index-symbol triad and apply Peirce's method of categorial analysis, most of the other divisions, classifica- tions and nomenclature of his theory of signs will be generated.12 Secondly, we can use our results to explain the unity of practice and theory in semiosis using the results achived up to this point: if we accept predictions as the characteristic of theory and directions as the char- acteristic of all practical applications of knowledge, it follows that this unity is achieved, because, for all symbols and indices, our know- ledge about their role in other people's consciousness can be used as a basis for predicting and directing other people's semiotical behavior. Last but not least Peirce's analogy between laws of nature and rules of conduct gives us some reason for accepting Peirce's cosmological claim that mind and matter are really one. Even today Peirce's claim challenges us intellectually. A unified theory of mind and matter would have us understand all our knowledge about the evolution of man, nature and culture in such a way as to enable us to determine whether or not "the main laws of cerebration and particularly the formation of habit could be accounted for by the principles of probability" (Ms 875).

Sections 2 and 5 were written in response to some of the objections raised in the discussion at the meet- ing. My attendance was made possible by a travel grant of the Deutsche For- schungsgemeinschaft and I hereby express my gratitude. 1. This and all the following references starting with 'CP' and followed by a decimal numberirg refer to the Collected Papers of C. 5. Peirce, Vol. I- VIII, Harvard University Press, 1931-1956. All references starting with 'NEM' refer to one of the four (in five) volumes of The New Elements of Mathematics by C. S. Perice, ed. by Carolyn Eisele, 1976. 2. A good case in point is Rulon Wells' 'The True Nature of Peirce's Evolutionism," Studies in the Philosophy of C. S. Peirce, ed. E. C. Moore and R. S. Robin, 1964. He himself calls his paper an "essay in diagnostic pathology,'* thereby stating at the very beginning his negation of any reasonable "principle of charity" for his interpretation of Peirce. Of course, it is an easy way out of the problems and ambitious claims always present in Peirce's highly systematic way of doing philosophy to treat all this, with a sort of Neo-Wittgensteinian atti- tude, as just another symptom of the malady called philosophy! But almost twenty years ago, at such an early stage of Peirce scholarship, Wells' basis of textual evidence was severely limited and his whole approach strangely inappropriate, to say the least. For much more serious, but also very criticial discussion of Peirce's evolutionary metaphysics, see A. O. Lovejoy's "A Note on Peirce's Evolutionism" (Journal of the History of Ideas, 7, 1946) as well as in Bernard Suit's "Doubts about Peirce's Cosmology" {Transactions of the C. S. Peirce Society, Vol. XV, 1979). 3. In his book Peirce's Philosophy of Science, 1980, Nicholas Rescher reaches the conslusion that grounding the creative impulse for a new hypothesis in an instinctive preference, that is, Peirce's thesis that we have an abductive talent, is basically an anti-methodological mystification which he contrasts with his shift to a "methodological organon of hypothesis-construction": "This shift from an instinctive and biological to a methodological and cultural hypothesis-selection process enables us to preserve all the advantages of Peirce's approach, while avoid- ing its problematic reliance on a somewhat mysterious instinct" (p. 63). One reason for my disagreement with Reseller's conclusion is this: I believe that Peirce's logic of abductive arguments allows for a combination of an evolutionary theory of the biological and social conditions of human knowledge with a methodology describing the formal structure of its present and future growth. 4. Compare the rather poetic motto of this paper stressing the cosmo- logical and metaphysical background of this thesis. But in the unpublished Ms 870 "What is a Law of Nature?", c. 1901, Peirce supplied a methodological j usti-</page><page sequence="30">238 Helmut Pape fication for the use of anthropomorphic metaphors: 5. But since there is no possibility of framing words, or conceptions either, unless it be in the most scanty and insufficient supply, other- wise than by metaphors founded on human conduct, if a metaphorical word fits the facts not only in the respects which were sufficient to suggest its use and render it intelligible in the fust instance but also in respects that were not thought of when it was invented, search for a more appropriate word would be in vain (p. 6). 5. All numbers of manuscripts refer to the listing of Peirce's manuscripts in Richard S. Robin's Annotated Catalogue of the Papers of C. S. Peirce, 1967. The quotations are transcripts taken from the microfilm edition of Peirce's papers. 6. An evolutionary explanation of laws of nature was described by Toul- min and Goldmann in The Discovery of Time as a possible next step in the de- velopment of science: "And if the 'laws of nature' turn out to change slowly from one cosmic epoch to another, that will be only the last step in a historical trans- formation which has already affected the rest of science" (p. 271). The crucial question is, of course, what a "cosmic epoch" means. In astrophysics, for example, it was possible to prove that the fine structure constant ^TTe where e is the electron's charge, h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light, was constant during the last two billion years. See A. D. Tubbs and A. M. Wolfe, "Evidence for Large-Scale Uniformity of Physical Laws," in Astrophysical Journal, 1980. But every cosmologist, who accepts the standard model, that is, the Big-Bang theory, will admit that it is reasonable to ask (a) whether the laws of nature existed before the time zero of the Big-Bang and (b) why we have in this universe the laws of nature that we do have and not different ones. Possibly both questions require an evolutionary explanation. 7. Another passage bringing out how general Peirce's notion of existence really is comes from the unpublished part of Ms 478: "The 'existing' thing is individual only in the sense of being a continuous law regulating and unifying events of a series of instants." For Peirce, only singular events have a 'genuine' individual existence and in this sense an event happening by absolute chance is Peirce's paradigm of what he, e.g., in CP 3.93, calls individual existence in the strictest sense. But this is, of course, not the standard notion of an individual thing existing in space and time, and most of the time Peirce is well aware of the fact that his "strictest sense" of individual existence is quite another conception than the usual one, for it assumes that the existence of things is analyzable in terms of regularities in the existence of events. It is, of course, the usual or standard notion of existence which Peirce denies to an event happening by absolute chance. G. Riley's essay on "Peirce's Theory of Individuals," in Transactions of the C. S. Peirce Society, 1973, points out the generality of Peirce's conception of an in- dividual.</page><page sequence="31">Peirce 's Semiotics 239 8. This is one of Arthur O. Lovejoy's arguments against Peirce 's cos- mology in his "A Note on Peirce's Evolutionism." See note 2. 9. Speaking about the way the utterer directs an interpreter by using an index and attributing a directive meaning to an index and a predictive meaning to a symbol should make the reader aware of the fact that Peirce's semiotical seman- tics was rather close to the game-theoretical analysis of language which David Lewis has proposed in his book Convention: A Philosophical Study in 1969. The close connection between Peirce's pragmatism and the theory of games was discovered in 1956 by Jurgen von Kempski. See his paper "Der Aufbau der Erfahrung und das Handeln" in Archiv der Philosophie, 6. A good exposition of ''Peirce's Anticipation of Game Theoretic Logic and Semantics" was given at the meeting of the Peirce Society and the Semiotic Society of America in Lubbock, Texas, in 1980, by Jarrett Brock. 10. See note 9 above. 11. For example, it would be very important to see in which way iconical or diagrammatic reasoning, which transforms a set of premises in order to arrive at a conclusion, is the sort of reasoning required for every instance of theorematic deduction. Theorematic deduction, in contrast to corrollarial deduction, which does not require any transformation within the set of premises needed for deduc- tion, was described by Hintikka in his paper "C. S. Peirce's 'First Real Discovery' and Its Contemporary Relevance" in The Monist, 63, 1980, as the distinguishing mark placing Peirce within the formalist, that is, "symbolic, proof-theoretical tradition of Frege and Hilbert" (p. 313). However in his treatment of the indexical and symbolical components of reasoning Peirce pursued a constructivistic ap- proach. 12. Of course, this "consequence" presupposes a realistic semiotic. That is, a semiotic which accepts the thesis that its most important aim is to describe the way in which the reality of objects is grasped by the universal categories of cognition. On this topic see Klaus Oehler's paper "Peirce's Foundation of a Semi- otic Theory of Cognition," Peirce Studies, Institute for Studies in Pragmaticism, 1979.</page></plain_text>
