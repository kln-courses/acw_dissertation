<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Chapter  ix Male to female Social opposition versus communal solidarity The myths This chapter takes us to the ‘male’ socio-ritual sphere. Two out of the three  Kaware myths (Ml, M2) summarized in Chapter III are strikingly similar to,  yet different from, their Asmat counterparts.1 In Kamoro Ml and its Asmat  counterpart the two heroes of each set, though named differently – Kamoro  Muanuru and Asmat Yenip – are also namesakes, one from the world-in- between of humans, the other from the underworld. In this respect they are  similar to the Kamoro heroes of the sun and the moon related to the upper  world. Likewise, antisocial behaviour, namely brother-sister incest on the ini- tiative of the brother (unlike Ema Kame) in the case of the Kaware and Yew  Mbu myths, adultery with an older brother’s wife (Kamoro sun myth), and  theft by a neglected orphan (Kamoro moon myth), drives the hero out of his  world and into the world beyond. In Kamoro M2 and its Asmat counterpart  the terrestrial hero, Kamirima and Fumuripic respectively (similar names,  different language), arrives at the underworld after drowning in a dubious  accident after having intercourse with his mate’s mistress. Also in line with the upperworld narratives, the earthly hero of M1 and  his Asmat counterpart get the better of their underworld namesake. The plot  is identical. They use a trick to pilfer their namesakes’ ‘fried’ mussels or sago  grubs (Asmat). In addition, the Asmat earthly hero appears to be superior to  his namesake in being physically complete. The underworld hero’s eye sockets  and anus are stuffed. His earthly namesake opens them up with a bamboo  knife. In spite of this benevolent service, the Asmat hero from below, like his  Kamoro counterpart, punishes the earthly visitor for stealing his sago grubs  (or mussels) by tricking him into the arms of a human mbish in the central pil- lar or – as in Mimika – a separate spirit pole. The victim gets stuck and is in the  process of being tortured to death when his earthly relatives and affines arrive  1 For the full texts, see respectively Offenberg and Pouwer 2002:108-11, 98-102, 102-8, 93-8. </page> <page sequence="2"> 180 Gender, ritual and social formation in West Papua just in time to chop off the head of the underworld malefactor. The earthlings  get off with the booty. There is a difference, though. The Asmat loot includes  almost every item of material culture: the blueprint of the men’s house and  other ceremonial houses, war shields, eating bowls, various kinds of bags,  a variety of tools, drums, and all kinds of ceremonial outfits and carvings.  With canoes brimming to capacity, the men return to the village in triumph:  ‘That is why we now have men’s houses, why we wage war and hold festi- vals. Thanks to Yenip, life has become worthwhile. [...] Some people learned  to drum and sing; others learned to work wood. Each family was assigned a  task.’2 Before the exploits of Yenip, ‘when people had not been living in this  country for long, there were no yeu [yew]. [...] Each family lived and took care  of itself. Their lives consisted of nothing but collecting food, eating and sleep- ing. There was no entertainment (Offenberg and Pouwer 2002:102).’ In short,  the Asmat ascribe their cultural heritage to the exploits of Yenip. This also  includes the prescribed way in which the body of a victim of headhunting is  dealt with. Yenip’s sister cuts off the head of his underworld namesake after  he has been killed. The rest of the body is butchered and cut up as they used  to do with pigs of the forest. So Yenip-from-below rates as the first victim of  headhunting.3 This ‘total’ ascription of society and culture to the exploits of  Yenip seems to reflect and validate the central position of the yew and the  men’s house in Asmat society and culture. The Kamoro, however, restrict their  narrative ascription of cultural items to the blueprint and paraphernalia of the  Kaware house and ritual, but do include all the sacred songs of all their rituals,  taught to them by a noma watersnake in the vicinity of the ceremonial house.  This specific Kamoro addition seems to highlight the dominant position of  males in oral communication with the sacred (puri) world of the dead and the  spirits. In the Asmat story the watersnake teaches Ton Yenip the proper yew  songs; he was singing the wrong ones. The Kamoro also owe to the culture  hero Muanuru all foreign garden produce, such as coconuts, white pumpkin,  papaya, breadfruit, taro and sweet potatoes; these are not mentioned in the  Asmat version. This may equally reflect the important though not exclusive  say of males in the ownership of garden produce, especially of the arboreal  kind (Pouwer 1955a:151-6). Kamoro M2 and its corresponding Asmat narrative initially revolve around  the theme of life and death. An anthropomorphic sea eagle resurrects the dead  body of the culture hero, washed up on an island, by spreading medicine on  its vital parts with a smouldering stick (Asmat). In the Kamoro version the  body is revived by a variety of scratching birds and stinging ants and wasps.  2 Zegwaard in Offenberg and Pouwer 2002:108. 3 For details of the apportionment, see Offenberg and Pouwer 2002:107. </page> <page sequence="3"> IX  Male to female 181 This reflects what happens when, for instance, a woman in labour faints: the  ipu (Kamoro), the spiritual life force that is supposed to have briefly left the  body, is recalled by means of applying a smouldering stick to vital body parts.  When the Asmat hero is brought back to life, he says that he did not even  know he had been dead (Offenberg and Pouwer 2002:95).  After this common start, the Asmat and Kamoro versions, both widely  known throughout the area, diverge. The Asmat hero, returning to the main- land and feeling lonely, builds himself a yew house and carves out men and  women on small poles, and they come to life through his drumming and  singing (Offenberg and Pouwer 2002:96). I presume that these ‘small poles’  are believed to constitute the foundation piles of the first men’s house from  which humans originate (Eyde 1967:335). Eyde makes the important observa- tion that  [e]laborately carved poles resembling foundation pilings [though bigger] are  carved during the spirit mask ceremonial cycle [Yipae] among the Keenok [inland  Northwest Asmat], but not, to my knowledge, among the Kawenak [lowland  Central Asmat around Flamingo Bay]. Even among the Kawenak, however, the pil- ings of men’s houses which perform the Jipaj ceremonial cycle are crudely carved  into human form. (Eyde 1967:335.)  While travelling west immediately after his creative act, Fumuripic repeats  the exercise, thus bringing to life the people of other Asmat yew, of the neigh- bouring Kamoro settlements, and of other Papuan locations as far as Kaimana  in the far western part of Mimika. He also creates the Surabaya people (white  men), and arranges for the present location of Kaokonao, where he builds a  big men’s house and supplies the local people with iron axes. He then returns  to Asmat, to the Fai River, where two of his sons supplied with guns were  already living (probably a reflection of a police station in this area). He leaves  for Kaokonao a second time, calls in there for a big feast, but then discovers  that the people have stolen his axes. He shoots them all, but for one man and  one woman from each river (who then multiplied). He then proclaims him- self to be the District Officer, and arranges for his children to join him: they  become the Chinese traders (who had a store in Kaokonao) and look after his  supplies. So the Asmat story accounts for their neighbours and for the foreigner, his  wealth and power. By far the greater part of the myth deals with foreigners.  The section on the District Officer was added by men from Ewer who hap- pened to attend the telling of the story by men from Shuru (Offenberg and  Pouwer 2002:97). This second part of the Fumuripic narrative, rather than  being on a par with the second part of the Kamoro Mamirima story, resembles  the Mirokoatayao story of Ema Kame. The two heroes have in common that  they carve out the social groups of their kin, though in different ways: one  </page> <page sequence="4"> 182 Gender, ritual and social formation in West Papua from the flesh of the monitor lizard, the other from piles of the men’s house.  In this way the previously unknown is appropriated, ‘kamoroized’ and ‘asma- tized’ respectively. The killing of the monstrous monitor lizard in the ceremo- nial houses constructed by the Kamoro hero is located on a beach on the far  western border of the Kamoro area. The site of the men’s house built by the  Asmat hero is also located far to the west: on the shore of the mainland oppo- site the island where he was brought back to life. This site is said to be near  the mouth of the Owap River on the far western border of the Asmat area. He  himself originates from the Sirec River to the east in Central Asmat. (The site  is not too far removed from the Kamoro island of Puriri in Pisang Bay, where  Fumuripic’s Kamoro namesake Mamirima is said to have been revived.) The  Fumuripic narrative, like the Mirokoatayao narrative, is sung but not acted out  during the Yew Mbu and Ema Kame rituals. This is another parallel, which  might have a bearing on the ‘foreign’ subject matter. The second part of the Kamoro Mamirima myth, instead of dealing with  the articulation of social groups, foreign commodities and power, exempli- fies Kaware ritual. Mamirima not only constructs its ceremonial house on the  model seen in the underworld – like Fumuripic who builds the first men’s  house, the ritual centre of most Asmat ceremonies – but also initiates the ritual  of male adolescents, who lie down at the central supports of the house as if  dead, without a fire or loincloth, entirely naked, and with drawn faces like  the dead. Evidently this is an enactment of the hero’s death, followed by an  enactment of his subsequent return to life (see Chapter III). The story also tells  of his invention of the drum, in which he is assisted by a fish, which hollows  out a block of wood. The drum serves to accompany the sacred songs acquired  in M1. The story continues with the hero carving out a mbitoro and making  the nokoro kao boards for the symbolic canoe of the culture hero Nokoro, two  crucial Kaware ritual attributes. A malevolent earth spirit is annoyed by the  drum, tramples it to pieces and kills the hero, who is hidden in the drum.  His parents, meanwhile, arrive on the scene, mourn their son, and avenge his  death by beating the evil spirit to death. They then thrust their lances into the  sand of the shore: they wage a battle against the evil comrades of the killed  spirit. This battle is acted out on the beach as a spectacular show: it marks  the ritual end of the Kaware ceremony. Finally, in the story as well as in the  ritual, Kaware is concluded by a social ceremony: a massive distribution of  pile-worms and mussels among the guests ‘from the east and the west’, as the  story has it (Offenberg and Pouwer 2002:102). All these enactments (except the  distribution of food) are absent in the Asmat ritual.  So, the Kamoro differ from the Asmat in that there is a close correspond- ence between the myth and the ritual. In Tipuka, which rates as the Kamoro  main centre of Kaware, the initiates are even confronted with the hero’s dead  body, while the Sempanoweof Inawka, who do not celebrate Kaware, never- </page> <page sequence="5"> IX  Male to female 183 theless re-enact his resurrection by birds (Chapter III). The virtual absence of correspondence between the Asmat Fumuripic myth  and the ritual of Yew Mbu/Tow Mbu on the one hand, and on the other hand  the similarities to myths accounting for the genesis of ethnic groups, includ- ing the ethnic groups of foreigners and their wealth, give credence to Eyde’s  (1967:335) suggestion that Fumuripic’s creation of humans from foundation  piles of the original men’s house is associated with Yipae, rather than with Yew  Mbu and Tow Mbu. In addition, foundation piles of men’s houses, where their  occupants perform the Yipae ceremonial cycle or the related Firao Wu cycle,  are carved into a human form, whereas piles of houses, where the men perform  different cycles, are not (Eyde 1967:96). The sacred songs about Fumuripic (see  Chapter VI) are performed together with songs of the Yipae heroes Kurap and  Sarawap in the course of the Yipae ritual. Since Yipae originates from inland  Northwest Asmat and this region is adjacent to inland Nafuaripi to whom the  Sempanowe are related, the very fact that the Sempanowe of Inawka (who do  not practise Kaware, yet re-enact the resurrection of the hero) seems to point  to an original connection between Fumuripic and Yipae. Yipae relates to the  Mbish ritual and to Emak Cem as the ‘female’ component of social reproduc- tion of Asmat society. Its ‘male’ counterpart, Yew Mbu, is associated with polit- ical power and communication with the underworld and the upper world. The Kamoro Kaware myth M3, which has no Asmat mythical parallel  (although it does have a ritual one, as we shall see), is partially a ‘male’  inversion of the ‘female’ Asmat Emak Cem myth of Ufiripic and his daugh- ters (Chapter VII, Ml). In Kamoro M3, the widower, Kinako or Nokoro, is  cheated by his daughters. He deserts them by leaving for the underworld  in a short and heavy ironwood canoe of his own making. He leaves behind  a longer model of it for them. This is the mythical predecessor of the tradi- tional river-going dugout canoe. In the course of the story the daughters turn  into tidal trees subject to submersion, ever since then tormented and shaken  by their father as a punishment for shaming him. In the Ufiripic story it is the  other way round: the father cheats his daughters into marrying him. When  they find out and drown him, he turns into a turtle, ever since then consid- ered to be the sacred local lord of the land. Not he but his daughters leave  for the underworld with a prototype of a canoe of their father’s making, his  invention left for them. He orders them to go west. In line with the ‘female’  Ema Kame/Emak Cem orientation, these women are instrumental in the  making and acquisition of earlier Western wealth by their male companion  on the far western border of Mimika. It is interesting to note that Nokoro, as  well as being acted out in the ‘male’ Kaware ritual, also turns up as a Kaware  counterpart of ‘female’ Ema Kame by the acquisition of contemporary  Western wealth in East Mimika. This has materialized since the arrival in  the 1960s and 1970s of the huge Freeport Indonesia mining enterprise, which  </page> <page sequence="6"> 184 Gender, ritual and social formation in West Papua excavates copper and gold and attracts Kamoro labourers from west to east.  It so happens that Freeport’s Portsite complex, including a facility for drying  copper concentrate and for loading it onto ships, situated at the mouth of the  Tipuka River, is adjacent to an island called Nao Nokoro by the Tipukans,  or Karaka (lobster) island by outsiders. This island is part of the territory of  Tipuka, the main location of Kaware celebrations. Its name means ‘Nokoro  in the shadow (or invisible)’ (Drabbe 1937:86). At high tide it is submerged,  and therefore invisible. Hence the belief that Nokoro has resided beneath the  island ever since he left his daughters.4 An Atuka group of men moved to  this island in the early 1970s to work for Freeport at the Portsite Amamapere.  They did not compensate Tipuka for the use of their island, for ‘[t]hey [the  Tipukans] never come out here to challenge us because they are afraid of  a giant whale that according to their stories lives just on the other side of  this island’ (Harple 2000:201). It seems likely that this whale impersonates  Nokoro, who rocks his daughters, alias the tidal trees, with huge waves.  Tidal waves are indeed heavy in this area, due to the shallow sea. It is also  interesting, as Harple rightly notes, that the Tipuka mythical fear of Nokoro  is resorted to by the Atuka mining personnel to justify their occupation of  the island without compensation. There may be even more to it. Harple  refers to a solemn prediction (imakatiri) in which an elderly man, Natalis  Nokoryao, from his hospital bed in 1960, ‘claimed that he had prepared  roads for cars at Timika [the inland main site of Freeport] in order to receive  goods that would arrive on large boats. He went on to say that the goods and  the boats were already present, but not always visible’ (Harple 2000:184). He  ‘held that at some point the goods would become visible and very quickly  be spread throughout Mimika’.5 Numerous Kamoro came to his bedside  (Harple 2000:185). His cargo-cult-like prediction was made in an atmosphere  of high expectations raised by the activities of the Dutch colonial govern- ment and initial explorations by a Dutch company, a predecessor of Freeport.  The prediction came true. That same year a company expedition reached the  Ertsberg, thus confirming Nokoryao’s prediction, although political circum- stances delayed its actual realization (Harple 2000:196). Unfortunately, we  do not know whether the name Nokoryao, meaning son of Nokoro, is merely  coincidental, or whether it was given or claimed on purpose as a reminder  of the culture hero. 4 For this literal meaning, see Harple 2000:201. 5 Harple 2000:185, citing Mampioper 1961:11. </page> <page sequence="7"> IX  Male to female 185 The rituals Eyde (1967:334-5) notes that there is a tendency for Asmat ceremonial cycles  to be arranged in pairs: another manifestation of dual organization. The inau- guration of a men’s house and the sago grub ritual is such a pair. Although  the cultivation and consumption of sago grubs are part of almost every  Asmat ceremonial, the connection between the inauguration of a men’s house  and the sago grub ritual is intrinsic and strong (Zegwaard 1953b). The sago  grub ritual is also part and parcel of Kamoro Kaware, but is explicitly associ- ated with Nokoro (see Chapter III). This is not so among the Asmat, at least  not explicitly. Zegwaard’s report is based on observations by David Yakafa,  a Sempan assistant teacher from Otakwa, who attended the ceremonies in  Kapi, Northwest Asmat, celebrated from 7 January to 29 March 1953. His  findings tally by and large with Zegwaard’s own experience observing these  ceremonies in Shuru, in December 1954.  The Kapi recently lived together with the Ao-Marpac, but a war in the  region and brawls with Ao-Marpac occasioned a retreat. Its 300-350 inhabit- ants were organized in two sets of paired yew mopan, hence two times two,  Amnes-Taray and Kapono-Kapi. The four men’s houses or quarters were  situated in that order on one side of the river, from upstream to downstream.  Amnes was the host of the ceremony, assisted by Taray; Kamtar, a fairly young  man from Amnes, was the leader. On 7 January all the men of the village went  to a particular site in order to inspect the number and quality of mature sago  trees to be selected for the cultivation of a large number of grubs, a sort of  stocktaking by the feast givers meant to show their generosity to the guests,  namely the two other yew. At night there was yi muc singing in the village:  songs (muc) about yi, the sacred ‘in the beginning’, by professional singers and  drummers. The next day temporary shelters were made on the site. Kamtar  invited volunteers for felling the first sago trees. After some [merely theatri- cal?] hesitation, a man of the host yew volunteered, assisted by two others.  He was presented with an axe by Kamtar; its acceptance commited him and  his helpers to providing the singers with plenty of food during the ceremony.  Four men representing the other yew also offered their services. The seven  volunteers selected four adjacent mature sago trees, one for each yew. While  felling these, they saw to it that the trees crashed down simultaneously with  one impressive thud. These acts were accompanied by songs sung by the  official singers about cutting the tail (epe) of a tree kangaroo and the juicy top  (wu, ‘palmite, millionaire’s cabbage’) of the sago tree. The two extremities (epe)  apparently have their vital energy in common [compare this with Kamoro ipu  enakoa]. Also, four axils of palm leaves were cut for making four bowls, one for  each yew. Finally, four cylindrical blocks of about 80 by 35 centimetres were  cut out of four trees [or one tree, according to informants from elsewhere].  </page> <page sequence="8"> 186 Gender, ritual and social formation in West Papua These, representing the four yew, would serve as ceremonial containers for the  heap of sago grubs at the ceremony.  These acts ceremonially announced the start of massive felling of trees, in  which many personally owned square holes were made, serving as cultiva- tion beds for the sago grubs, which take about eight weeks to mature. During  this period the sacred songs about Ton Yenip and Aman Yenip of M1 were  performed at night and repeated many times by professional singers. The  singing rose to a climax at sunrise, and, similar to its Kamoro counterpart, was  attended by every adult and young man.  New canoes were made in this period. However, hewing canoes is not  restricted to one ceremony but also occurs during rituals such as Emak Cem  and Yipae. Songs in honour of deceased persons carved out in a sitting posi- tion at the bow of the canoe are also performed repeatedly.  If the bark of the blocks of wood is so dry that it makes a ‘krr’ noise when  it is scratched, the sago grubs have matured. On 2 March the grubs were ready  for consumption. The next day men left for the woods to collect materials  for building a new men’s house. The bachelors in particular were assiduous.  Women and children were not allowed on the premises. After three days of  keen work, the materials were ready. The construction of a men’s house is  described in detail by Eyde (1967:90-7). Here I merely note some distinguish- ing features. The men of Kapi cleared the vegetation from a rectangle of about  54 metres on each side. Around this clearing, piles stripped of bark, 5 to 6 feet  long, cut with points at one end, notched on the other end, and spaced about  a metre apart, were pushed into the ground by groups of men. They climbed  on them or embraced them, giving a loud ‘vuh’ with each heave that forced  the pile into the ground. Zegwaard notes that heaped trunks reinforce the  muddy ground of the rectangular clearing. The construction has to be solid to  accommodate hundreds of people, including many guests, and must stand up  to massive dancing and stamping. On this foundation a floor of rounded hard  outer layers of sago trunks, face upwards, is laid on and tied to underlying  joists with the piles as their support. The piles are lashed together with poles  running the length of the house. Two horizontal lines of poles join long verti- cal wall-poles over the full length of the house. Walls are braced with split ribs  of sago fronds. A line of very long posts (yipic oc), extending 5 to 6 feet above  the walls down the length of the centre of the house, supports the roofbeam.  These alternate with shorter posts (mis os), each with an arm sticking out and  upwards (an aerial root stood on its head) that support in their crooks the  poles on which the rafters rest; the rafters in turn support a thatched roof.  Provisions are also made for a covered porch at the front of the house.  In Kapi the shorter posts were not carved. Usually crude carvings represent  deceased relatives of a household, the members of which sit and lie under- neath and between these posts around their fireplace. A square about 3 by 3  </page> <page sequence="9"> IX  Male to female 187 feet formed by four poles surround the fireplace; a rack above the fireplace  serves to store firewood, fish, meat, weapons and other personal possessions.  In the new men’s house in Kapu there were seventeen fireplaces, each cor- responding to a door opening: eight upstream, eight downstream for each  moiety of the Amnes [or for each yew of the pair; the description is not quite  clear on this point], and a common fireplace in the middle. The space at the  rear running the length of the house near the central beam was reserved for  living quarters. Its width of about two metres was considerably less than the  adjacent open space on the front of about three metres over the full length of  the house for public use, walking, dancing, sitting and lying. This division was  reflected in the roof: its rear side was shorter and steeper than its front side  (Zegwaard n.y.e:3). The front wall or parts of it are often left uncovered as a  reminder of unavenged relatives (Zegwaard n.y.e:3). The construction of the men’s house was completed in one day. The neigh- bouring villages of Kapi, Yeni and Atat were then invited to attend the inau- guration of the house.  This began with a festive testing of its strength. Men and boys trampled  the floor over its full length while beating shields with daggers. Bachelors’  houses upstream the Utumbuwe and Sirec Rivers are inaugurated by women  dancing in it for a full night and morning (Zegwaard n.y.e:3). Sometimes men  of other yew, with the approval of the builders, playfully attempt to ruin the  new house by forceful dancing and stomping.  On 8 March men and women left together for the sago grub sites to col- lect the grubs and in particular to fill the four ceremonial bowls made earlier.  These bowls are named after living or deceased of the four yew, particularly  murdered male or female members. Their bride-receivers are the stewards of  these bowls and it is their duty to fill them; for instance, one bowl, named after  a living man called Kakay, was administered and filled by his daughter’s hus- band. Meanwhile, a number of men in the village prepared a long cylindrical  tube about 3 metres long, made of pandanus leaves with the sides of the leaves  sewn together. It is called samu mini, meaning spirit of a decapitated member  of one’s own yew. It was placed in the centre of the new house. The tube was  named after the host’s main wife, who was deceased. A special platform was  built above it. The trays stuffed with grubs were provisionally stored in the  vacated men’s house and decorated with paint, feathers, and young sago  fronds. Large quantities of grubs were stored in family houses. At night the  trays and the four cylindrical blocks were taken to the new house. The blocks  were placed in a square around the bottom of the tube, thus constituting a  container sharing its name with the tube. The women danced wildly, and the  drumming was highly excited. The grubs were placed carefully into the tube  by women [and men?], who emptied and refilled the trays. The quantity of  grubs was so huge that a surplus was deposited on the platform. A Taray dig- </page> <page sequence="10"> 188 Gender, ritual and social formation in West Papua nitary, a young man, was the master of ceremonies. He inherited the function  from his father, a renowned storyteller. He sang: ‘We, as numerous as parrots,  will eat today the sago grubs of ...’, and then enumerated three sites. The peo- ple distinguished between grubs consumed during the drumming sessions  and grubs consumed in honour of the new men’s house. Bride-receivers of the  host slowly unbound the upper sides of the tube, seeing to it that no grubs  came out until the moment the lower sides were opened up. Then the grubs  tumbled out in large quantities and spilled over the enclosure. The adolescents  fled in all directions. The grubs were then distributed, first to the men of Yeni  and Atat, then to the men of Kapom and Kapi, and finally to the men of the  hosting yew of Amnes and Taray. The massive consumption and distribution  of sago grubs, promoting a sense of community, probably has connotations of  fertility. Sowada insists that it was at this time that new papish partners were  selected and that communal wife-swapping was celebrated. At the conclusion  of this phase in Ac there was mass wife-swapping (Trenkenschuh 1970c:37).  On 10 March the guests returned home and the people of the village went  fishing. On 11 March some men worked on their new canoes, while others  took it easy. On 12 March festivities resumed. Now it was women’s day, their  turn to celebrate. Fully dressed up, they danced on the premises of the men’s  house. Kamtar’s bride-receivers made a new tube, with a different name  (acir), made of different material: sheaths of the sago palm decorated with big  leaves of a passion flower which are used in mock battles; hence the name nao  (killing) in a headhunting party. The tube was named after a festive leader’s  young daughter who had died when the ceremonies began. The same young  man acted as ceremonial leader. The tube was opened in three stages by  bride-receivers, during which there were three bouts of ceremonial praising of  headhunting achievements in three locations. Again the young men fled when  the sago grubs tumbled down. A number of older men took this opportunity  to collect and hide a good number of grubs for their own secret consumption.  By so doing they acted out what the culture hero Yenip-from-above did when  he deceived Yenip-from-below. Zegwaard notes that during the ceremony in  Ayam older men even made a double bottom in the tube to secure their secret  share of the catch. It is this observation of the Asmat ceremony which makes  intelligible a similar act by Kamoro older men during the Kaware ritual: secret  consumption of grubs (see Chapter III). Women have priority in the distribu- tion of sago grubs. There was drumming, singing and dancing until dawn. In  Amborep (November 1952) and Shuru (December 1954) women danced in the  men’s house.  After a fortnight’s rest there was a spirits’ (nat) play by women on 25 March.  The men left the village in their canoes in a semicircular war formation. The  young men went fishing while the older men stayed in temporary huts. In the  </page> <page sequence="11"> IX  Male to female 189 village a number of older women, impersonating spirits wearing mock battle- dress made of big leaves as mentioned earlier, chased the younger ones with  fronds of sago leaves; this mock battle went on for hours. At dusk all the men  returned, blowing on bamboo horns as if returning from a headhunting party.  The young men meanwhile shared their catch of fish with the older ones. As  soon as the women heard the horns, they stopped the game. A communal fish  meal concluded the day.  After a few days of collecting sago, the festivities continued at dawn on  27 March, by acting out how Yenip-from-above evaded his namesake while  pilfering his sago grubs by moving round the row of burning firewood over  the full length of the men’s house, in a direction opposite to the direction his  namesake was moving in. A row of burning firewood was placed over the  full length of the men’s house. Young men from upstream Amnes and Taray  lined up on the upstream side of the men’s house, and young men from down- stream Kapom and Kapi lined up downstream. While singers performed ‘in  the beginning’ songs, the two parties shifted their position: from upstream to  downstream and the other way round. This game of running youngsters was  repeated many times, for about two hours. Then people were free to take a  nap, but everybody was on deck again for the final sunrise singing and danc- ing (as in Mimika).  The ceremony ended with another massive exchange of sago grubs. On 28  March everyone except the singers and drummers collected large quantities  of sago grubs at the cultivation sites. At dawn part of the harvest was tacked  on sticks and taken to the men’s house. First of all, the singers received their  share from everybody. Then a ceremonial exchange was performed between  the paired upstream yew on one hand and the paired downstream yew on  the other. The upstream ones took their grubs to the centre of the house and  offered these to the downstream yew, then the latter moved to the centre  and reciprocated. The grubs were consumed at the individual fireplaces.  Singing and dancing continued till sunrise. After this collective exchange  there was also an individual exchange. All social and individual relations  were expressed and confirmed by these exchanges. On later occasions these  exchanges were sometimes recalled as ibu ipic: ‘the man (ipic) with whom I  exchanged’. On the same night four large parcels of about 125 x 15 centime- tres stuffed with large quantities of grubs were made, roasted and stored in  racks. The next day these parcels were exchanged among the four yew and  ceremonially carried to the canoes. They were taken to the temporary shelters  for consumption. Men of note and the singers stayed there and enjoyed eating  the grubs, while the others went fishing. After some days of rest or working  on canoes, the last of the grubs were eaten. It was now time to move seawards  and enjoy fishing. </page> <page sequence="12"> 190 Gender, ritual and social formation in West Papua In a comment on an illustra- tion of a container for sago  grubs used at the initiation  of a new men’s house in Yao- Sokor, in 1978, after 20 years  of prohibition, Schneebaum  (1985:105) opines that this  container, known as basu  suangkus, is unique for some  Keenakap-speaking villages  of upstream Sirec River and  surroundings.

Kaimo, Asmat, 1982. From:  Konrad, Konrad and Sowada 2002:153. is merely a local variant of  the samu mini container as  described above. It differs  only in that the Yao-Sokor  four cylindrical pieces, cut out of one trunk, are interconnected by a mat  serving as a bottom of the container. The two horizontal sections also have  carved human figures at each end. This container constitutes to my mind the  fascinating ‘missing link’ with the Kamoro Kaware container for sago grubs,  also provided with a mat serving as a bottom. This container represents  nokoro kao, the outer form or cover shell (kao) of the short sinkable (ironwood)  canoe of the culture hero Nokoro, by means of which he travels underwa- ter to the underworld (see Chapter III). The tube is missing in the Kamoro  ritual, but ‘right’ and ‘left’ men do throw large quantities of sago grubs into  the canoe container; the dancing Nokoro impersonator standing in his canoe  container is surrounded on his left and right by large heaps of sago grubs  that are then distributed, as in the Asmat case. It seems likely that the Asmat  containers are also at least reminiscent of canoes. Hence the human figures  representing deceased persons of note, carved on the imaginary bows of the  Yao-Sokor container. These persons are explicitly sung about in the ritual  song Ci Bi So, literally the (canoe’s) bow song, performed during the period  of maturation of sago grubs and on the day the tube is opened for women, a  tube that explicitly connotes war and headhunting parties. Although, at least  as far as we know, Nokoro is missing in the Asmat myth and men’s house  ritual, the ceremonies and massive ceremonial distribution of sago grubs of  Kamoro and Asmat are similar in their evocation of threat and war by men  in canoes. There is a difference, though. In the Kamoro case Nokoro stand- ing in his canoe exhorts the women to take good care of ‘us men’. His call is  yet another demonstration of gender opposition. The men board canoes for a  </page> <page sequence="13"> IX  Male to female 191 risky and demanding trip inland to cut timber for new canoes; they run the  risk of falling victim to an attack. The Asmat case evokes its very counterpart:  not the victims but the initiators of an attack, men boarding canoes for a war  party. The emphasis is on gender solidarity in the face of war. Both men and  women act out a mock war, each in their own way. Kamoro and Asmat final  ceremonies have in common a massive distribution of the powerful delicacy  of mussels or sago grubs.  Conclusions The intricate web of connections between myths, rites and social reality, and  a comparison of the Asmat and Kamoro rituals, may be summarized as fol- lows.  Both the Asmat and the Kamoro associate two myths, respectively about  Yenip (Asmat) or Muanuru (Kamoro), and Fumuripic (Asmat) or Kamirima  (Kamoro), with the ritual concerned, though in varying narrative versions.  The Kamoro myth about Nokoro is, as far as is known, not shared by the  Asmat. However, the Asmat and Kamoro do have the subject matter of this  myth, namely the sago grub ceremony, in common in the rituals under discus- sion.  Nevertheless, there are marked differences in orientation and focus between  Kamoro Kaware on the one hand and Asmat Yew Mbu and Tow Mbu on the  other.  The main concern of the Asmat ritual initiation of a new men’s house, the  sago grub ritual, is the celebration and promotion of communal strength and  solidarity, explicitly including relations between men and women. Its prin- cipal culture hero is Yenip-from-above, Ton Yenip. He is credited with the  transformation of society from small, dispersed, rather isolated, self-sufficient  bands that scarcely made a living, into a large, powerful community enjoying  access to abundant natural resources, and the pleasures of a rich social and  cultural life, including warfare and headhunting as highlights. In short, Ton  Yenip rates as the primeval founder of Asmat society and culture. His exploits  playing tricks on his namesake-from-below are re-enacted in the ritual. The  massive ritual collection and distribution of sago grubs expressing and pro- moting cross-gender social strength, solidarity and exchange, is accompanied  by a mock enactment of warfare by males and females separately. In the course  of the ritual, females praise and encourage males in their martial exploits,  which are proudly spelled out by the war leaders. In the past, the ritual was  either preceded or followed by a headhunting party.  The exploits of Fumuripic, the culture hero of resurrection and of the  creation and demarcation of neighbouring and foreign social groups and  </page> <page sequence="14"> 192 Gender, ritual and social formation in West Papua their wealth, are not enacted in the ritual but are sung about. His exploits are  associated with the more inland-oriented Yipae. It is reported, though, that  the choreography of dances performed while reciting the Fumuripic myth  on the occasion of consecrating a new men’s house in settlements at the Sirec  River mimics limbs that come to life and slowly begin to move to the rhythm  of drumming.6 For the Kamoro, on the other hand, the Kaware ritual marks not the soli- darity but rather the opposition between males and females. Kaware is prima- rily a male affair. It is men’s prerogative to communicate with the dead. The  transition from death to life is a male secret. Not the myth of Muanuru, but  the myth of Kamirima’s resurrection is acted out. The male initiates play dead  and stagger back to life. Kamirima himself is regarded as Kaware’s initiator.  The effigies in the mbitoro spirit poles, representing recent dead, are also ritu- ally brought back to life by men. Nokoro of the underworld is impersonated  as well. He acts as the males’ representative in demanding and receiving large  quantities of sago grubs and he exhorts the women to take good care of the  men. Last but not least, it is the men who act out the revenge of Mamirima’s  violent death by waging war and thrusting their lances into the sand: they  are crushing the evil spirits who killed the hero and who threaten human  life. Kaware also offers a proud demonstration of male skills: men construct  canoes, sago bowls, sago pounders, paddles, masks and spirit poles in the  course of the ceremonies and they are ceremonially rewarded for their services  by women. In sum, in terms of gender relations, Kaware is a demonstration of  male impression management, male secrets, and male skills and tricks, such  as snatching prepared food from the women.  The myth of Muanuru only shows up in the Kaware ritual in the prohibi- tion on consuming garden products that originated from the ceremonial house  in the underworld.  Admittedly, Kaware also resembles the Asmat Yew Mbu and Tow Mbu  rituals in its massive exchange and distribution of pile-worms and sago grubs,  but its emphasis is on highlighting the contribution of males to life, in contrast  to the Asmat demonstration and promotion of a sense of community among  both men and women. For the Kamoro there is no ‘women’s day’. Kaware is  a male stronghold.  6 Van der Zee 2005:405, referring to Van Renselaar 1956 without supplying page numbers.  </page> </plain_text>
