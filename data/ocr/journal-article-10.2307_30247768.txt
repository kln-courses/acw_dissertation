LOPEZ MUSEUM OF CULTURAL HISTORY UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES ABSTRACT Most Tarahumara aesthetic manifestations occur in ritual circumstances. Meanings frequently refer both to Christian and non-Christian ideas. Contact with European culture seems to have expanded the possibilities of creative expression among the Tarahumaras. Aesthetic manifestations among the Tarahumaras occur both in cere- monial and secular contexts, but a greater elaboration and profusion is found in the former as opposed to the latter. Holy Week celebrations are particularly important, for it is here that artistic developments reach their broadest use in terms of community participation. Of somewhat less significance are ceremonial dances, all of which may include in their performance the use of objects carrying some form of decoration. Men's and women's costume, pottery, basketry, and toys serve as avenues for aesthetic development among the Tarahumara; however, profane objects do not necessarily demand from the Tarahumaras intense creative involvement, and shall not be considered in this paper. Easter ceremonies have been discussed at length by Kennedy and Lopez (in press), however, with treatment of the ceremonial paraphernalia being limited to its function. In Samachique and other areas of the southern Tarahumara region arches made from pine branches are placed at intervals marking the route Holy Week processions are to take (Figure 1). The arches measure about eight feet in height and are generally decorated with three or sometimes twelve wreaths made from the woven leaves of a dasylirion; when three are used, two are placed at the sides of the arch and one at the top. The diameters of these measure about ten to twelve inches, and the crown stands about three inches from the base. The brilliant cream color of the crowns contrasts dramatically with the green of the pine branches. These arches are of an ephemeral nature and last only from Wednesday until Saturday of Holy Week, when they are uprooted and destroyed. They do not seem to have any sacred significance, or if they do, it is of a temporal nature. The wreaths are salvaged as souvenirs by some of the people attending the ceremonies. Historically the arches can be traced to the last quarter of the seventeenth century, when they were reported by Salvatierra (Pennington 1963:165). Pennington's idea that the "use of arbors for festival occasions" 207</page><page sequence="2">THE KIVA Vol. 37, No. 4 Figure 1. Pine arches mark the route of a Holy Week procession. may be pre-contact in origin seems to be founded on rather tenuous evidence, since Salvatierra's letter, which Pennington uses as his basis for the thought, does not refer to these arches until almost three quarters of a century after contact with European culture had been initiated. There is, furthermore, no use of these arches in connection with indigenous ceremonies. It seems very unlikely that the practice of using decorated arches in association with autochthonous ceremonies would be transferred to the celebration of a single Christian holiday, no matter how great the overlap of form and timing of beliefs, and that the arches would be then omitted from all other ritual or formal occurrences. It further seems doubtful that a concept as complex and 208</page><page sequence="3">Vol. 37, No. 4 THE KIVA monumental as the use of decorated arches for procession would be indigenous to a society having so limited a material culture. In the northern area, at Sisoguichic, the arches have degenerated to the placement of pairs of pine saplings along the procession route. These lack the dasylirion wreaths; however, they designate the Stations of the Cross as they do in the southern area. The most important ritual element produced by the Tarahumaras for the Easter celebrations is a Judas figure. Two types are made shortly before Holy Week ceremonies begin. In the southern area straw dummies are made over a wooden frame, and are sometimes used in pairs (Bennett and Zingg 1935:313; Kennedy and L6pez, in press). These generally measure from two to three feet in height and appear to be little more than formless straw bundles. As with the arches, they are ephemeral and are destroyed on Holy Saturday afternoon after they have been ravaged by lances. In Sisoguichic and some of the surrounding villages, a life-sized wooden statue of Judas is carved from madrofio, the color of which is said to be the color of human skin. The work is done secretly, with only a handful of select people knowing the location of the activities surrounding the statue. These individuals generally belong to the fariseo sodality that is active during the Easter celebrations. The figure is roughed out at the spot where the tree designated to become Judas has been felled. Since this spot is usually a good distance away from the village, the figure is brought in closer to town to be finished. In spite of its closer proximity to the community, the location of the figure is still kept secret from all but the few above mentioned fariseos. Work on the final stages of Judas now commences. It is important to the Tarahumaras that the statue be made as realistic as possible, particularly certain parts of his body which perforce take the greatest amount of detailing: the head, arms and hands, and lower torso. Detailing begins with the head and work on the figure moves downward to the feet. The head is carved with ears, nose, eyes, and mouth, all carefully delineated. The mouth is a cavity with teeth placed in it, these being either dog's, pig's, or small pieces of wood shaped to look like teeth. Eyes are constructed by gouging deep sockets and placing small pieces of charcoal and bits of white stone to indicate eyeballs, which are then covered by pieces of green glass, giving the face a realistic and fierce look. The arms are articulated at the shoulders and attached to the figure by means of wooden pegs. Each arm and hand is made of a single piece of wood, and the hands have knuckles and fingernails clearly defined. On occasion a finger of one hand may be inadvertently broken off during the carving process, and the carver will simply form the other hand to conform with the broken one, since a symmetrical design is considered proper for Judas even at the sacrifice of realism. The arms, when the figure is in ritual use, are positioned at a right angle to the body, as if reaching out for 209</page><page sequence="4">THE KIVA Vol. 37, No. 4 someone. The lower torso is realistically equipped with an anus and rather large erect penis. The member is sometimes omitted, although the fariseos consider it to be of major importance to the figure. Schematic feet are carved and nailed into notches at the bottom of the legs, and an attempt is made to have the statue stand without props of any sort. The final touch is to dress the statue in Western clothing, invariably discarded hand-me-downs. Cow's hair is glued to the head for hair, face for a moustache, and to the pubic area emphasizing the realism attempted in the figure. The statue is employed on Friday and Saturday of Holy Week, during which time it is carried in processions, fought over, watched over, ritually given food and tezgiiino (corn beer), danced to, wrestled for, and finally ritually destroyed and later burned (Kennedy and L6pez, in press). To the fariseos the Judas statue is needed to maintain fertility in plants, animals, and the people of the community. The earliest reference to the construction of figures around early spring appears in Lumholtz (1902:354), and relates the making of a straw figure that represented Father Sun. This was dressed in Western costume and involved in a "performance" of some sort, and later taken to a field to ensure plant fertility. It is clear that Lumholtz' figure relates to fertility, and the contemporary straw and wooden Judas statues are more than likely a continuation and outgrowth of the earlier straw figures. The Judas in Figure 2 was carved especially for the UCLA Museum of Cultural History's collection in the summer of 1966 by the same people who had made the Judas for the previous Easter celebrations, Refujio Vecino, the fariseo General, and his cousin and compadre Abelardo Vecino, a fariseo Capita"n. As it is customary and essential for Judas to be destroyed on Holy Saturday afternoon, the writer felt it better to obtain a copy of the statue rather than to disrupt important elements of the Easter celebrations by collecting a statue of ritual significance. The fariseos use various accouterments as identifying insignia during the Easter celebrations. These consist of wooden lath swords, reed flutes, drums, feathers, and on occasion, body painting. The lath swords measure about forty inches in length and carry painted designs on both sides and along the narrow edges. The designs consist of astral motifs individually placed into clearly defined equal spaces running the length of the sword (Figure 3). Astral motifs may at times be replaced by zig-zag designs extending the length of the sword. Of the two types of designs, the former is traditional, while informants say the latter has made its appearance on swords only recently. The zig-zag design is the same in concept as that found on girdles, and these can be traced at least as far back as the end of the nineteenth century (Lumholtz 1902:249). Traditional colors are red, white, and black, and are generally found on older swords which are kept by individual owners year after year for use in these celebrations. Pigments used are ochres and 210</page><page sequence="5">Vol. 37, No. 4 THE KIVA Figure 2. A wooden Judas statue is shown which was made for the UCLA Museum of Cultural History. charcoal; however, more recently the use of commercial coloring agents are encroaching on the older traditions. The swords are carried in processions in which the fariseos participate as well as used to guard the Judas statue on Holy Friday night. A few fariseos are now nailing flattened bottle-caps to the swords in order to make them rattle, but this is not within the tradition. It is somewhat difficult to determine the length of time that swords have been used by the fariseos since there are no historic records that mention their use; however, informants maintain that they have "always" been used. Because of the commanding positions of those who use swords in the processions, it is possible that these pieces refer ultimately to the still extant authority staffs (see below). The drums played by the fariseos are generally about twenty-four inches in diameter and four to six in depth (Figure 4). A thin strip of fresno is bent into a roughly circular shape and the ends tied together with either wire or rawhide. A length of twine with several small beads is stretched over one 211</page><page sequence="6">THE KIVA Vol. 37, No. 4 Figure 3. Left to right: two soldado lances, a fariseo sword, the authority staff of a lesser dignitary, and that of a gobernador. head, the beads hitting at its center. The twine is tied at one end to the rawhide lacing and to a wooden tuning peg inserted into the fresno side at the other. The sound produced is rather like a snare drum. Fariseo drums are identified by astral designs painted on one or both heads. These are stylized depictions of the sun and the moon, and are traditionally executed in the colors of the fariseos: red, black, and white. More recently the use of wax crayon polychrome has seen the deviation from the less colorful tradition. Crayons are frequently used in conjunction with a straight-edge; thus much of the spontaneity of earlier designs is lost. In Sisoguichic the drums are owned and kept by individuals; however, in other areas, such as Panalaichic and 212</page><page sequence="7">Vol. 37, No. 4 THE KIVA Figure 4. Left to right: fariseo drum, soldado flute, fariseo flute, and rattle constructed from wood shavings. Aboreachic, they are kept in a subsidiary room to the village church. It is possible that the present-day drum used by the Tarahumaras is post-contact, since the word used by the Indians, kampdra, seems to be from the Spanish tambor. Reed flutes are quite simple, and consist of a section of cane with a bill at one end, to which is tied a similar convex section to form the mouthpiece. They are equipped with four stops, and both the fariseos and soldados (a Holy Week sodality) use them during the Easter celebrations. As with the drums, there is a difference between those used by the soldados and those pertaining to the fariseos, in that the former are shorter than the latter. In addition to being longer, the fariseo flutes also carry simple linear designs, while the soldado flutes are undecorated, as are their drums (Figure 4). Plumed coronas, or headdresses, were reported by Bennett and Zingg (1935:313) as being worn by the "Judas" and "Pharisees" during Holy Week, and an earlier reference to their ritual use is mentioned by Lumholtz (1902:313). With the earlier reporter, however, the reference is to a shaman wearing "a headdress of the plumes of birds" at a feast. This was done in order to gain information from the birds and to keep the wind from entering them and causing ill. An even earlier mention is made by Juan Fonte (P6rez de Ribas 1944, 111:160). Fonte speaks of headmen wearing "plumeria" when receiving him in the early seventeenth century. It is possible that the plumeria refers to a feathered headdress. Somewhat later, shortly before 1767, Steffel 213</page><page sequence="8">THE KIVA Vol. 37, No. 4 (1809:345 ff.) speaks of dancers wearing feathered headdresses. Thus, the association of feathers with ritual and authority is established at an early colonial date, and probably has roots in pre-contact times. Fariseos at Sisoguichic still use feathers, but there is no evidence of elaborate headdresses being utilized by them during Holy Week. They simply stick turkey feathers into their straw hats or head bands. Body painting is still practiced in some parts of the Tarahumara area, e.g., Samachique (Figure 5) (Kennedy and L6pez, in press). Dots and meandering vertical stripes in white and red are the general rule today, while forty years ago, red, black, and white were used (Bennett and Zingg 1935:313). The colors red, black, and white are symbolic references to the fariseos in Sisoguichic, although body painting is no longer done in this town during Holy Week. Face and body painting were reported in Samachique by Bennett and Zingg (1935:304) for the Virgin of Guadalupe's day; however, they did not elaborate on the nature of the painting. Wooden lances are used by soldados during Holy Week as an insignia of office. These are frequently painted in red ochre on the raw wood, the designs being simply a single line spiraling around the length of the pole, while the point generally carries broad chevrons linked by a single vertical line intersecting the chevron angles (Figure 3). Old bayonets attached to poles are also employed in Sisoguichic and were reported earlier at Samachique, as Figure 5. Tarahumara body painting is exemplified by two fariseos. Note swords with zig-zag pattern. 214</page><page sequence="9">Vol. 37, No. 4 THE KIVA were lath swords painted orange and white (Bennett and Zingg 1935:304). The ceremonial use of lances is reported in the early seventeenth century by Juan Fonte in a description of his arrival at a Tarahumara rancheria:. "... toda la gente ... se juntaban en hileras para el recibimnienlto, precediendo el cacique con su lancilla o chuzo, plumeria y otros adornos que ellos iusanl" (Perez de Ribas 1944, III: 160). Unfortunately, Fonte does not give a description of the "lancillas"; nevertheless, it is an historical reference to their early ceremonial use. Bennett and Zingg (1935:207) cite the use of lances by capitanes as "symbols of office" in Cusaire. Another design appearing on lances used by soldados at Sisoguichic during Holy Week is one made up of a field of multi-colored lozenges covering both sides of the wooden point. According to informants, this is a recent development, both in the type of design and in the use of polychrome (Figure 3). The cross permeates almost all Tarahumara ritual, either as a physical entity or in hand motion. During Holy Week celebrations there are two types of crosses used that carry decoration. Pennington (1963:164) states "elaborate crosses made of aori (Juniperus pachyphlaea) and decorated with large rosettes made from leaves of sereke (Dasylirion Wheeleri) are erected in or near the churchyards during Easter festivals." Apparently (in the area visited by Pennington) these large crosses replace the arches mentioned above as markers for the Stations of the Cross utilized by Holy Week processions. The second type are small, measuring about twelve inches in length and are hand-held throughout the processions (Bennett and Zingg 1935:313; Kennedy and L6pez, in press). These are decorated with geometric linear patterns in red ochre. Although the contemporary crosses are simple in design and pattern, evidence of more elaborate crosses similar to these can be seen in one reproduced by Lumholtz (1902:174). In spite of the fact that Lumholtz does not discuss the use of the cross, its size and decoration place it in the same genre as the small Easter crosses. On occasion, large wooden crosses placed in dancing patios will be decorated by cutting rectilinear symmetrical patterns along the outside edges of the post and arms (Figure 6). The cross recorded by this writer was erected for a fiesta at which the yurmari was danced. A small altar containing food and tezgiiino offerings was set up at the base of the cross. The more elaborate matachin was danced following the yumari, and informants indicated that the former dance is frequently performed in front of a large cross and altar with offerings. Bennett and Zingg (1935:287) feel that the nature of Tarahumara religious beliefs would necessitate any indigenous form of the cross being a Greek rather than a Latin type. Since most crosses used by the Indians have a post that is considerably longer than the crosspiece, they feel that crosses were introduced by missionaries. Their successful adaptation by the Tara- humaras was largely due to autochthonous religious ideas that were 215</page><page sequence="10">THE KIVA Vol. 37, No. 4 Figure 6. Wooden cross erected in dancing patio contains both Greek and Latin attributes. compatible to the cross concept, e.g., the significance of the four cardinal points in Tarahumara religion. It is of interest to note that the carving on the cross illustrated in this article delineates the Greek type, even though the overall form is obviously Latin. This interplay between Latin form and Greek decoration is not unusual in the Sisoguichic area, as this writer has seen several large crosses similarly carved. Whether or not the play between the two types of crosses has any deeper significance to the Tarahumaras remains unknown; however, this writer feels that on the basis of the extremely broad, almost obsessive, use of the cross motif and its multifaceted meaning to the Tarahumaras, the interaction between form and decoration is very likely of some symbolic significance. 216</page><page sequence="11">Vol. 37, No. 4 THE KIVA The most elaborate costumed Tarahumara dance is the matachil. An early account of it appears in Steffel (1809:345 ff.) without, however, any mention of the dance's name. From his description, nevertheless, it is clear that this particular dance is the one being alluded to. It is performed on all holidays, generally lasts two days and two nights, and is danced by young men dressed as Europeans. One of the earliest references to the Tarahumaras employing masks appears in the same passage, where Steffel creates a rather charming vignette of two men masked with grey beards and hunchbacks, each carrying a "plumpsack", or some kind of bundle. As these two individuals move around the dancing matachines they murmur to them, and occasionally strike them with the "plumpsack". Steffel's eighteenth century masked murmurers are obviously the matachines' chapellones of today. Lumholtz (1902:354) relates that matachines carry "skin bags of fox, squirrel, or opposum", and use face paint, as well as deer masks and heads. Basauri (1929:64) in his section devoted to crafts calls attention to the production of anthropomorphic and zoomorphic matachin masks. Bennett and Zingg, in their study (1935:300 ff.), give a somewhat more detailed description of masks associated with the matachin dance. Here the chapell6n oversees the dance and wears a mask as a symbol of his authority. The mask is made of wood, painted with white lines, and has white hair and beard glued to it. It is worn on the back of the head at Samachique, and over the face in Guadalupe. At Samachique the chapallones, in addition to their masks, also carried inflated bull bladders used to scare away stray dogs threatening to disrupt the dancing; the plumpsack seemingly no longer being directed toward human targets. The matachin costumes reported by Bennett and Zingg are well in keeping with Steffel's narrative: that is, a degeneration of eighteenth century European dress. Feathers were still incorporated in the headdress and dance wand, or palma, and strands of rattles continued to be wound around the ankles. The rattles themselves, however, had changed from interlaced rabbit claws to interlaced cocoons with pebbles sewn into them, such as the pascoleros use (Basauri 1929:70; Bennett and Zingg 1935:245). As in Steffel's day, the matachin of 1930 was danced on numerous holidays, including those related to the Christian calendar as well as those of a more indigenous bent (Bennett and Zingg 1935:303 ff.). Today in and around Sisoguichic the matachin is danced at almost any kind of celebration, with the possible exception of Holy Week, although a non-elaborate version may be performed at the tezgiiinadas associated with the Easter celebrations. Tjhe matachines wear denim trousers, which at times are rolled up to slightly below the knee, and a large square cloth with flower prints on a white ground folded diagonally and tied around the waist with the point hanging at the front. A long-sleeved white shirt is worn, with a flowing dark colored cape tied at the neck extending well below the knees, over which multicolored neckerchiefs are tied with the points at both front and 217</page><page sequence="12">THE KIVA Vol. 37, No. 4 back. A variegated kerchief is sometimes tied around the lower part of the face. Ideally, colored stockings and shoes or boots complete the costume. A corona made of a framework of thin slats of wood is placed on the head. It is decorated with painted red flowers and long streamers are attached to the superstructure (Figure 7). A palma, made of a wooden frame to which are wired crepe paper flowers, is carried in the left hand (Figure 7), and a gourd or wood rattle is carried in the right. The chapellones wear denim shirt and trousers, a not uncommon form of male dress for the Tarahumaras. Accouterments that identify them in their role are masks and whips. The masks are either anthropomorphic or zoomorphic. The former are at times painted with wax crayon in bright colors, frequently with indications of beard and hair. They can also be left unpainted, with no hint of facial hair, or they may be embellished with a white or black beard and moustache (Figure 8). Normally, carving is shallow, the most prominent relief feature being the nose. Some attempt is made to smooth the surface as a manner of finishing the piece. Zoomorphic masks are never painted, nor is hair ever attached to them. The hair used is cow's tail, or at times raw sheep's wool may be employed. Masks appearing to be monsters are sometimes made and used by the chapellones, as are pieces combining both zoomorphic and anthropomorphic elements. When masks are made that draw on both human and animal forms, they frequently depict an anthropomorphized owl, the Tarahumara harbinger of death to men. This is Figure 7. The corona (left) and palma (right) of a matachin. 218</page><page sequence="13">Vol. 37, No. 4 THE KIVA Figure 8. A chapell6n mask. well in keeping with the function of the chapell6n as seen by the Tarahumaras living in the area of Sisoguichic, for the role is one of instilling fear into the matachines in order that they dance properly. The whip is explained as a threat of fearful punishment, thereby adding to the frightful stature of the chapell6n. It has apparently replaced the plumpsack, skin bags, and inflated bladders of earlier times, if indeed these were ever used in the Sisoguichic area. Rattles are commonly employed ritually by the Tarahumaras in both indigenous and Christian ceremonies. Early rattles were reportedly made of gourds (Steffel 1809:245), and by the end of the nineteenth century Lumholtz (1902:313) reported types "made from coarse (wood) shavings and glued together". He further mentioned that rattles made from wood shavings were at times decorated with simple "daubs" of color. Contemporary gourd rattles on occasion carry geometric patterns made of tiny holes placed around the circumference of the gourd. The holes are important in that they allow the dust generated by pebbles rubbing against the inside of the gourd to 219</page><page sequence="14">THE KIVA Vol. 37, No. 4 escape, thereby ensuring a sharp sound from the instrument. Considerably more work is required for producing a rattle from wood shavings than from a gourd. Five or six concave sections of equal dimensions are glued together to form the body of the rattle. These wrap around a wooden handle which frequently carries a carved cross at the top (Figure 4). Although this writer has never seen this type of rattle with decorative painting, he has observed, on rare occasions, gold metalic paper strips glued over the joints of the sections making up the rattle. Violins are associated with ritual as accompanying instruments for certain dances. Steffel (1809:320) mentions not only violins, but the zither and lute (Steffel 1809:346) as musical instruments played by the Tara- humaras. Today neither of the last two are found among the Tarahumaras, but it is not unusual to encounter guitars being played in lieu of, or along with, violins when matachines or pascoleros are performing. Violins and guitars are made by many Tarahumara men, but only the former are occasionally decorated. Carved embellishment is restricted to the head of the instrument, and takes the form of either an anthropomorphic or zoomorphic (coyote) head carved in full relief (Figure 9). More infrequently, the violin Figure 9. Full-relief carving on head of Tarahumara violin. 220</page><page sequence="15">Vol. 37, No. 4 THE KIVA will be covered with crudely executed wax crayon designs, usually geometric and in a single color. No mention is made by any of the early writers of decorations appearing on Tarahumara stringed instruments; however, little attention has ever been paid to the aesthetic manifestations of these people, so it is certainly possible that such minor decorations could have been overlooked. The final area of Tarahumara ritual aesthetic expression to be touched upon in this paper is that of authority staffs. The use of some form of baton to indicate office may date to a period prior to that of contact with European culture, as Fonte, one of the first missionaries in the Tarahumara area, mentions village headmen forming a reception line holding a "lancilla" or "chuzo" (P6rez de Ribas 1944, III:160). Spaniards encouraged the use of authority staffs among the Indians they came in contact with; thus the idea may have been easily accepted by the Tarahumaras, if they already had a similar concept. At any rate, batons of this sort have a well established history among these people dating to the colonial period. They are mentioned by Steffel (1809:312) shortly before the Jesuit expulsion in 1767, and by twentieth century writers. Bennett and Zingg (1935:201) describe the staffs as being about two feet long and one inch in diameter. At the head they have carved crosses and a drilled hole which takes a thong or string for hanging. Often they are equipped with a brass cartridge case or silver adornment at the tip. Lumholtz (1902:140) gives a similar description, although he does not mention the crosses. Today the authority staff is still very much in evidence among the Tarahumaras, and two types are currently in use in the Sisoguichic area. The first closely resembles the descriptions of Lumholtz and Bennett and Zingg, while the second differs considerably. Both types have carved designs, and one takes painting in addition to the carving. The first staff seems to be the more traditional of the two. It is made of a tapering straight piece of wood, though which a hole has been burned just below the head. The hole is for the attachment of a leather thong or a piece of looped twine. Lumholtz (1902:140) mentions red ribbon being passed through the hole; however, this writer has never observed this. The cane is carved with an architectonic design consisting of a series of contiguous flutes with arrises between each flute. The flutes run the entire length of the piece (Figure 3). The cane is left unpainted and represents a form that identifies lesser dignitaries in Tarahumara officialdom. The second type is bent at the upper end to form a handle which is the only part of the cane left undecorated. From the bend at the cylindrical handle to the bottom, the four-sided piece is covered by carving and painting. Immediately below the handle and on the front of the staff is a small anthromorphic figure carved away from the body of the staff. The figure stands erect with arms outstretched at the sides, forming a cross - a possible 221</page><page sequence="16">THE KIVA Vol. 37, No. 4 reference to the crosses on canes mentioned by Bennett and Zingg (see above). Directly below are two more anthropomorphic representations, one drawn as a stick figure, and the other a highly stylized figure in very low, abstract relief. This latter figure stands with its arms at its sides, while the other have outstretched arms. The lower figure also wears a rather elaborate headdress, somewhat reminiscent of matachin coronas, and what may be a representation of a mask. Below and around the figures the staff carries geometric linear patterns, some of which are similar to astral motifs found on fariseo swords. The colors used are red (vegetable dye), black (charcoal), and white (white clay), the fariseo colors. This staff refers to the office of gobernador, or area headman (Figure 3). CONCLUSION Kennedy (1963:634) has argued that Tarahumara living patterns tend to inhibit creativity in the individual, and Bennett and Zingg (1935:297) have intimated that exposure to European culture has allowed the Tarahumaras amplified avenues of expression. These ideas are not necessarily contradic- tory, for Tarahumara creative efforts are rudimentary and seem to be largely directed toward European religious introductions. Indigenous activities that could accomodate aesthetic efforts remain, by our standards, rather drab, or have incorporated European forms. Archaeological evidence, although not particularly comprehensive, has produced nothing that might point toward previous highly developed or sophisticated art traditions (Zingg 1940, Asher and Clune 1960, Clune 1960). It is of interest to note that the introduced cultural elements and the immigrants carrying the European culture seldom, if ever, manage to maintain the same level of intensity or complexity encountered in their original state. The physical geographic realities of the area impose a tremendous strain on cultural ideas developed in entirely different ecological systems, forcing them to assume altered manifestations if they are to survive at all. The Tarahumaras, on the other hand, have tended to reinterpret and adopt European culture traits, thus generally enriching their own society. This has been particularly true in the area of aesthetic manifestations.
