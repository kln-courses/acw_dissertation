<plain_text><page sequence="1">74] Recent Literature Bird-Banding January tectively colored; some seek shade during the intense heat of midday. It is un- fortunate that this chapter contains a number of serious errors and implications. Contrary to the allusions on pages 9 and 10, birds and most terrestrial reptiles are known to excrete nitrogenous wastes chiefly in the form of uric acid and not as urea. The suggestion in this chapter, as well as elsewhere in the book, that fat "yields an especially high amount of metabolic water . . ." as "an emergency water reserve . . ." is without documentary evidence. As Schmidt-Nielsen (Desert A-nimals. Oxford Press. 1964) points out, 1 g fat may yield 1.07 g H20, but this process requires oxygen which can be supplied only by increased ventilation of the lungs. The latter process would evoke increased evaporative water loss from the lungs, thereby negating any "gain" in metabolic water from fat oxidation. Lastly, it was disturbing to find no discussion in this chapter of salt balance among desert vertebrates. Certainly the recent investigations on this subject in marine and terrestrial vertebrates suggest some fascinating problems on the desert. The accounts of the bird species are typical of Miller's careful observations and precise expressions. With few exceptions these accounts include behavioral adjustments of birds to the rigors of desert life-secreting themselves in midday, dry vs. succulent food consumed, panting, migratory habits. For the breeding birds there are data on nests, their positions, construction, and contents. Among the more intriguing discussions are those relating to problems facing migrants, such as flycatchers, warblers, and fringillids. Certainly for these birds, and probably other forms as well, autumnal migration is particularly strenuous be- cause the migrants encounter not only extremely high ambient temperatures but also a potentially unreliable food supply (insects) in unfamiliar territory. As a result, the authors detected numerous casualties among migrant birds, especially immatures. Other fascinating accounts are those of the jays, phainopepla, and the several species of sparrows. In many of the species accounts, interesting questions of survival and adaptations to desert, existence are raised. In other cases problems are dismissed too lightly, as in the roadrunner account where there appears the statement that it "is not bothered by heat or lack of water." Mammals, some amphibians, and a host of reptiles are also encountered in this desert area, even though many of them are nocturnal or subterranean in nature. Discussions of these species follow the same format as that of the birds. The best-known mammal, from the standpoint of adaptation to desert life, is the kangaroo rat, and the account of this form includes much of the Schmidt-Nielsens' earlier work. For some unexplained reason, however, the authors did not include relevant data on temperature regulation and aestivation in the pocket mouse pub- lished by Bartholomew and Cade in 1957. In the various reptile accounts one might question the value of including data on body temperatures (averages and extremes)-do they really mean anything when virtually no correlations are made with substrate type and its temperature, air temperature, recent activity of the animal, wind currents, and other variables? On the whole, this book achieves its avowed goal of presenting a resume of physiological and behavioral adaptations to the severity of desert existence. No doubt it will be a valuable source book and guide to those interested in the desert vertebrates of southern California.-David W. Johnston. 59. Black Brant/Sea Goose of the Pacific Coast. Arthur S. Einarsen. 1965. University of Washington Press, Seattle. 142 pp. $5.00. There are relative- ly few books devoted to North American bird species, in contrast to the steadily increasing number of such monographs from Europe, and especially Germany. The value of this approach, of gathering in one place all pertinent aspects of the Black Brant's biology, is well illustrated by this useful book, and a few of the pit- falls show up as well. In the author's words. the book was "written as an attempt to engender a better common understanding of the brant's living habits, the hazards to its survival, and the means by which better management of the species can be obtained .... The style employed is clearlv for the layman, but the scope is broad and the approach sufficiently scholarly to interest the ornithologist. Einarsen begins by describing his bird, and discussing its classification. He explicitly states (p. 4) that he will follow the A. 0. U. Check-list, which considers Branta nigricans as a distinct species, but immediately contradicts himself by using the name B. bernicla nigricans, without, however, referring to Delacour and others who have grappled with this problem. A fuller discussion of brant system- atics might have clarified what seems here to be a vague muddle. Breeding and</page><page sequence="2">Vol. XXXVII Recent Literature [75 1966 wintering distribution is discussed next. It is noteworthy that, although nigricans breeds as far west in the Soviet Arctic as the Taimyr Peninsula, the migration route passes down the east edge of the Pacific. The author chooses to view this as a mystery ("logic must be cast aside"), but it parallels the migration pattern of other recent avian colonists of Siberia, such as Grus canadensis and Hylocichla minima, and clearly indicates a North American origin for the Black Brant. Winter distribution is discussed more fully than breeding, where several important references are not cited. There is also a brief section of Asian records, but unfortunately no Soviet sources were consulted. Chapters three, titled "Distinctive Characteristics," includes wing structure and flight power, flight mannerisms, and feather wear, the substance of which is that brant, ocean-adapted, are among the fastest anserine fliers, but exhibit extreme plumage abrasion also. They are wary but gregarious, and easily decoyed if large spreads are set out. Voice and calls are discussed here, though with unnecessary anthropomorphism. A short chapter on feeding habits follows. When the brant are not breeding, they eat little besides sea lettuce (Ulva) and eel grass (Zostera), and the disasterous results of this near-monophagy is well-known in Atlantic brant populations However, the information given on eel grass disease is scanty, and most readers would want to know more. Another gap in this section is the lack of data on brant food habits during the breeding season. Having set the stage, the author proceeds to chronicle the life cycle of the brant, with detailed discussions of breeding behavior, mating, nesting, care of goslings, migration, and predation and other sources of mortality, including hunt- ing. The book closes with chapters on the brant as a game species, and discussions of current management practices, with recommendations for future changes. Einarsen concludes that although most native hunting is not a threat to brant populations, unregulated harvest near population centers such as Nome is po- tentially dangerous, and urges closed-season protection from Eskimo hunting in these places. Excessively large numbers of decoys, scull boats, and offshore blinds are hunting practices calling for prohibition or limitation. Most effective would be establishment of special brant refuges, with four sites recommended: nesting grounds on the Yukon Kuskokwim delta and migration and wintering areas at Izembek Bay, Alaska, Humboldt Bay, California, and the Scammons-Black Warrior lagoon complex in Baja California. Finally, the need for further intensive research on brant is made clear. The book is somewhat marred by contradiction and repetition. Thus we read on page 3, that "the first flight of the black brant marks the opening of the [spring] hunting season", and on page 11, that "it [brant] arrives there the latest of all the birds, after nearly all the other geese have passed." The lead sentence of Chapter 4 reads "Unlike most other waterfowl, the brant do not include a wide variety of both plant and animal matter in their diet" (p. 28). On the next page, the reader is again told "Unlike most other waterfowl, their diet does not include a wide variety of both plant and animal matter." Much of this distracting lack of ac- curacy and conciseness might be due to insufficient editorial care on the part of the publishers. I have only one other general criticism; the ink sketches scattered throughout the text are disappointing. In happy contrast, the photographs are of good quality and add much to the book's usefulness. In sum, although the reader must have patience with a certain amount of irrelevant, repetitive or contradictory detail, there is much interesting and val- uable material brought together in Einarsen's work.-Robert S. Hoffmann. 60. Birds in Florida. Edited by R. J. Longstreet. 1965. Trend House, Tampa. Illustrated. 176 pp. $4.95. This is apparently the fourth "edition" of the book, the first one appearing in 1931 as "Florida Birds: Biographies of Selected Species Occurring in Florida." The present volume differs little in format from the earlier issues except that Mr. Longstreet has attempted ". . . revision, adding and subtracting and. . . re-ordering the bird categories. . . ." It appears to me, how- ever, that the greatest improvement has been the addition of Sam Grimes' beauti- ful color plates, 32 of these. No doubt these illustrations will help to sell the book. Apparently, it has been the conception of the several authors of Birds in Florida that the general public is more interested in a few common birds than all the species occurring in the state. As stated in the foreword, "it was the original aim to present biographies of birds which the untrained observer would be likely</page></plain_text>
