<plain_text><page sequence="1">ELI iUnI I I]rU i eMU OJ~MW Section Editor: Louise Poissant Leonardo Editorial Advisor The New Media Dictionary project [1] was born out of the desire to name and define the many and varied forms of art that have devel- oped in conjunction with technology. A whole lexicon is being created to describe the many processes, techniques, instruments, and critical and aesthetic concepts-in short, the entire emerging culture-of this immense laboratory workshop. The terms selected for this issue form Part 2 from the field of Multimedia. The initial dictionary installmentfor Multimedia terms appeared in Leonardo 36, No. 1. The terms and definitions have been chosen by the Groupe de recherche en arts mediatiques (GRAM). Interested artists and researchers are invited to submit additions and comments to Section Editor Louise Poissant [2]. These contribu- tions will be added to the electronic version of the dictionary, with credit to the author. In this way, the New Media Dictionary will gradually become a collective project, in which each significant contribution willfind its place. These definitions were prepared by Jean Dubois and Suzanne Leblanc. Project director: Louise Poissant. Translator: Lou Nelson. DICTIONARY TERMS-PART VIII: MULTIMEDIA PART 2 MAZE-a web of connections typical of computerized com- munications networks and of the navigational pathways used in hypertext and hypermedia programs. The maze metaphor is widely used, especially in video games. MEDIA LAB-a research center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology working in the field of cyberspace and related technologies, particularly computer graphics, hypermedia, virtual reality, electroacoustic music, and networks. MEMEX-a memory extension system using associative index- ing and links to other similar systems. The memex system was originated by Vannevar Bush, who described it in an article called "As We May Think," published in 1945. It was intended to help cope with the information explosion, which was evident even then. The memex project was never com- pleted, but its main features, including the multimedia na- ture of the information and the creation of links as pathways between information resources, resurfaced some 20 years later during research on hypertext and hypermedia. The memex is considered the forerunner of these concepts. MEMORY MACHINE-a concept for the spatial organization of computerized data. Memory machines are based on the idea that information can be organized spatially. Using virtual reality and hypermedia navigation, these machines structure databases to resemble buildings and even urban environ- ments. MESSAGE SWITCHING-a data transmission method that uses intermediate links or switches at which the data can be stored before being forwarded to its final destination. This technique is also called store-and-forward (commutation, stock- age et retransmission). MOTHERFRAME-the main node in a hypertext or hyperme- dia program. MULTIMEDIA-See "New Media Dictionary Part I," Leonardo 33, No. 2 (2000). MULTI-PLATFORM-software that can run on different kinds of computers using different operating systems. IBM and Macintosh are examples of two types of computers that use different operating systems: DOS and Windows, for example, in the first case and one of the many versions of the Macin- tosh operating system in the second. MULTISCREEN-a multimedia application that uses a number of projection screens. Each screen can show an independent image or part of a larger image. MULTI-SENSORY ENVIRONMENT-an environment in which a number of the user's senses (sight, hearing, touch, smell, taste) detect or receive feedback from various elements. NANOTECHNOLOGY-technology in which circuits and ma- chines, called nanocircuits and nanomachines, are built on the scale of individual atoms and molecules (nanometric), rather than at the micrometric scale of groups of atoms and mole- cules (a thousand times larger than the nanometric scale), as is the case in microelectronics. The term molecular technology (technologie moleculaire) is also sometimes used. NARROWCASTING-the use of a cable network to provide specialized television programming to a precisely targeted and relatively small audience. NATURAL LANGUAGE-human language. May refer to any one of the many languages spoken in the world. NEON-a rare gas most commonly used in discharge lamps. The term "neon" has entered the popular vocabulary to refer to the discharge tubes used in illuminated signs. Neon produces red light and also, when mixed with helium, a red laser beam. NODE-a unit of basic information in a hypertext or hyper- media program. The node may include a block of text, a chart or diagram, a picture or sequence of pictures (ani- mated or video), a sound or series of sounds, or any combi- nation of these. A node can contain a number of anchors and be the destination of a number of links. Anchors are generally "hotspots" within a block of text or a picture, for LEONARDO, Vol. 36, No. 2, pp. 15151-156, 2003 ? 2003 ISAST</page><page sequence="2">example, that can be activated to jump to a different node. Nodes come in various basic forms, depending on the graph- ical interface (card, page, window, screen) of the authoring software used to create them. OBJECT-1. Basic concept in object-oriented programming. 2. Element in the graphical user interface of a hypermedia program that may have a script attached to it. This use of the term is borrowed from object-oriented programming in the high-level languages used by authoring systems. OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING-a computer program- ming method based on the concept of objects. Unlike tradi- tional programming methods, where procedures are separate from the data on which they operate, object- oriented programming combines procedures and data into one type of entity (object) that is the basic building block of the program. In object-oriented programming, objects use messages to communicate with each other. Each object con- tains appropriate reactions to the various messages it can receive, which determine what its next action will be. The objects are grouped into classes, and the classes are orga- nized into a hierarchy in such a way that objects lower down in the hierarchy can inherit behavior defined for objects at higher levels. ON-DEMAND PUBLISHING-the publication of documents in printed form, on CD-ROM or online over a network, based on selections made by a consumer from the catalogue of an information source, such as a publishing house, a govern- ment agency, or even a private individual. OOP-See object-oriented programming. OPTICAL FILTERS-transparent screens of glass, plastic or gelatin used to alter various properties of light (color, inten- sity or diffusion). In photography and videography, very high-quality filters are sometimes placed in front of the cam- era lens; other filters are mounted directly in front of a light source and are highly resistant to heat. Color filters are used to control the color of the ambient light. Neutral density filters affect the intensity of light without changing its color. PANRAMA-a technique in which an image is projected on the inside of a hemisphere so that it completely surrounds the viewer, resulting in an image with no frame. Experiments with Panrama, which was patented in 1958, initially used 16mm film before moving to the standard 35mm format. The process was used in public for the first time at Expo '67 in Montreal, where a film was projected on a 360? screen. In 1969, the first permanent theater, with a diameter of 12 m, was built in Montpellier, France. Since 1974, two types of screens have been developed in the United States: the first, called Omnimax, has a screen 22 m in diameter, uses the Canadian IMAX projector (70mm film, 15 perforations per frame) and is found in planetariums; the second, Atmo- spherium, has a screen 18 m in diameter and uses the stan- dard 35mm format with fish-eye lenses. The word panrama is a contraction of panorama, "circular view around a point." Similar to Philippe Jaulmes's "total cinema" concept, the presentation is tilted, with spectators seated comfortably in front of a hemispherical screen that is inclined at a 30? angle, parallel to the rake of the seating. This places the spectators in conditions that closely mimic real-world visual perception. PCM-See pulse code modulation, "New Media Dictionary Part VI," Leonardo 35, No. 4 (2002). PERIPHERAL VISION-parts of the human visual field located outside the area of central vision. In humans, the field of vision extends about 220? horizontally and 140? vertically. Peripheral vision accounts for the major part of this field. Shapes and movement perceived in these parts of the visual field help us to determine our position within the real envi- ronment, a characteristic that is put to good use in the crea- tion of virtual environments. Generally speaking, the feeling of immersion in the virtual environment varies depending on how much of the visual field is engaged by the VR display. Since central vision is always covered, this actually refers to how much of our peripheral vision is included. PHOSPHORESCENCE-a glow emitted by a substance after it has been exposed to intense light. PHOTO CD-a system for storing photographic images on CD-ROM and displaying them on a television set. This system was developed by the Kodak and Philips companies. PHOTOCELL-a photosensitive device that, when exposed to light, allows electrons to flow in an electric circuit. The pho- tocell resistance varies with light intensity. Photocells can be used to measure illumination and to control optical sensing systems. Unlike photovoltaic cells, photocells do not produce electricity; they simply allow the current generated by an energy source to flow. PHOTODIODE-an electronic component that converts visi- ble and infrared light into electrical signals. Photodiodes are used as light sensors for video cameras and compact disc players. PHOTOVOLTAIC CELL-a photosensitive device that trans- forms light energy into electrical energy. When exposed to light, photovoltaic cells generate an electric current; under the same conditions, photocells simply allow current to flow in a circuit that already includes an energy source. Solar cells are composed mainly of photovoltaic cells. The term photo- voltaic is derived from photon (particle of light) and volt (unit of electrical force). PIEZOELECTRICITY-an electrical current produced by the compression or mechanical distortion of certain crystals, notably quartz. Conversely, when an electrical current is passed through these crystals, they change shape or vibrate. The piezoelectric effect is used to measure vibration and mechanical stress. Piezoelectric crystals can emit and receive ultrasound; they can also be used for needles in phonograph cartridges. POLARIZING FILTER-an optical screen that blocks out all light rays except ones at specific angles. In photography and videog- raphy, this type of filter eliminates glare from non-metallic surfaces and reduces the atmospheric diffusion of light, thus improving color saturation and, in particular, making the sky a deeper blue. In sculpture and kinetic art, polarizing filters are used in the creation of optical illusions or interactive devices that are activated by the spectator's movements. POP-UP WINDOW-a window linked to a particular element in a graphical interface, for example a word or part of a 152 New Media Dictionary</page><page sequence="3">picture. The pop-up window opens automatically when the element is activated. POSITION SENSOR-a device linked to virtual reality periph- erals (headsets, wired suits and gloves) that sends data about the user's actions (in six degrees of freedom) to a virtual reality system. These data are used to change the virtual environment in response to the user's actions, thus re- creating how things would appear to the user if he or she were moving in a real environment. Examples of position sensors include infrared cameras; LEDs; radar; electromag- netic and ultrasound devices. This type of device was first designed by the U.S. Air Force. POSITION TRACKING DEVICE-See position sensor. POSTMASTER-See system administrator. POWERGLOVE-a type of wired glove that uses electrically conductive ink, a relatively inexpensive technology. The PowerGlove was introduced by Mattel in the late 1980s as a video game interface. PROJECTED REALITY-a virtual reality system that takes a real-time video image of the user interacting with the system and integrates it into the projected computer display. Exam- ples include Myron Krueger's Videoplace system and Very Vivid's Mandala system. RARE GASES-gases that do not form chemical compounds and that glow under low pressure when a strong electrical current is passed through them. They are also called noble gases, e.g. helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon. Because they have low electrical resistance and emit colored light when ionized, the rare gases are used in discharge lamps for illuminated signs. Neon produces a red-orange or bright red light, argon is lavender, helium is white or yellow, krypton is purple and xenon is blue. Mixing these gases with mercury vapor and phosphorus can enhance the brightness and make a range of over 150 colors available. Argon and neon are the most frequently used rare gases because the others are much more expensive. REALAUDIO-a system developed by RealNetworks (formerly Progressive Networks) for broadcasting real-time audio sig- nals over the Internet. RealAudio provides access to live audio files as if it were an AM radio broadcast. In streaming mode, the transmitted data is erased as soon as it has been heard. There is also a transfer mode, in which the audio file is stored in the computer's memory for later listening. REALITY ENGINE-a computer system that generates the visual and sound features of a virtual environment. RICH TEXT FORMAT (RTF)-a text file format that also con- tains page setup parameters. ROBOT-an automatic apparatus designed to perform a task normally done by a human. The term robot is taken from a Czech play, where the word robota ("compulsory work") is used to designate an "artificial worker." The industrial robot does not look human; its role is strictly functional. In con- temporary art, robots have largely been used to make ironic commentary about the social behavior of humans. In 1964, Nam June Paik created a remote-controlled robot, Robot K-456, that approached spectators and said hello. A year later, Edward Kienholz presented The Friendly Grey Computer-Star Gauge Model 5, a computer sitting on a chair that could answer yes or no to spectators' questions. Robots have also been used to create artworks automatically. In Amsterdam in 1978, Harold Cohen exhibited a small robot that could produce large abstract drawings on paper placed on the ground. The robot had an ultrasonic navigation sys- tem and was programmed with several rules of composition. Today, a number of artists are building robots, including Jennifer Hall, Laura Kikauka, Chico Macmurtrie, Stelarc and Norman White. ROLE-PLAYING GAME-a game in which the players play different characters in a story. Role-playing games became popular in the United States in the mid-1970s with Dungeons and Dragons, an interactive story developed by Dave Arne- son and Gary Gygax in the style ofJ.R.R. Tolkien's mid-1950s trilogy, The Lord of the Rings (published in French as Le Seigneur des anneaux). The story has a number of characters with very specific skills who face a series of challenges in which their particular skills will give them a greater or lesser advantage, depending on the situation. Similar games were available for computers in the late 1970s, but it was not until the 1990s that role-playing games such as W Industries' Leg- end Quest were installed on virtual reality systems. RTF-See rich text format. RTP-See real time protocol, "New Media Dictionary Part VI," Leonardo 35, No. 4 (2002). SCENE GENERATOR-the component of a virtual reality sys- tem that controls the environment's visual dimension and, in particular, calculates the variations in the display in response to the user's actions. The data set describing the physical features simulated by the virtual environment is combined with positional data from the user to generate images that show the various points of view corresponding to the chang- ing positions. The idea for a scene generator developed out of Ivan Sutherland's work on a visual system for use in flight simulators in the mid-1960s. Sutherland imagined a system that, instead of taking pictures directly with cameras, would generate its own images of the simulated environment. SCRIPTING LANGUAGE-a very high-level object-oriented programming language used in some authoring systems, e.g. HyperTalk, used in HyperCard systems, and Lingo, used in Macromedia Director systems. SENSOR-a device that translates physical phenomena (sound frequencies, light intensity or air temperature) into electrical signals that vary proportionally in intensity or po- tential, e.g. heat sensors, pressure sensors, radiation sensors. Common applications for sensors include microphones (sound sensors), light meters and solar cells (light sensors) and motion sensors (infrared sensors). Some sensors are used as data-entry interfaces for computers and robots, pro- viding digitized electrical signals for computer processing. Sensors must not be confused with detectors, however; sen- sors are components of detectors. SERVOMECHANISM-a type of feedback control mechanism that works by monitoring the state of a device and comparing it with the state predicted by its programming. Servomech- New Media Dictionary 153</page><page sequence="4">anisms can correct their position or speed by measuring the difference at any given moment between where they are and where they should be. SHUTTER GLASSES-viewing gear used with desktop virtual reality. The device consists of a pair of glasses with a stereo- scopic display and an infrared connection to a monitor. The stereoscopic effect, with its accompanying sense of depth, is produced as the shutters in the left and right lenses open alternately in synchronization with the monitor, which dis- plays alternating images showing the angle of view from the left and right eyes. The glasses are also equipped with ultra- sound position sensors. Although these sensors allow the picture on the monitor to coordinate with the user's head movements, the sense of immersion is limited by the fact that the user must always be looking at the screen. SIMULATION-a computerized representation of an entity, a process or an environment, real or imaginary. SIX DEGREES OF FREEDOM (6-DOF)-a key concept in posi- tion tracking, related to an object's position and orientation in space. Any movement through space can be defined by an object's changing position along the x-, y- and z-axes of Carte- sian geometry and by its rotation around these same axes. Six measurements are thus used to determine movement: three numbers representing the object's displacement in space along the three axes (translation), and three angles, called yaw, pitch and roll, that represent the object's move- ment around a fixed point (rotation). Yaw is rotation around the vertical axis; pitch is analogous to the seesawing motion of a boat, where the bow and stern rise and fall in alterna- tion; roll is like the side-to-side rocking motion of a boat around its long axis. These six measurements, which corre- spond to an object's position and orientation in space, can be calculated by a sensor, which then sends the data to a virtual reality program. SOFT ACTOR-an anthropomorphic computer-generated image that plays a role in a multimedia or virtual-reality pro- gram. In some cases, notably that of the VActor system by SimGraphics Engineering Corporation, the soft actor is linked to a real actor by a system that can generate image sequences from data recorded by a special device, such as a face tracker or a sensor mask. With this device, the computer can track the morphological changes related to the changing facial expressions of the real actor playing the soft actor's role. Tracking devices can be extended to the hands or the entire body, or can be combined with other equipment (slid- ers, digital pedals, 3D mice) used to control the position and actions of the virtual actor in virtual space. This system is used for both animation and real-time applications, with the real actor located offstage or even outside the performance space. SPEECH RECOGNITION-the analytical processing of the human voice to allow computers to understand speech. For speech recognition, the voice signal must first be converted from analog to digital. An analysis module breaks the signal down into segments and compares them with reference samples. The resulting matches are then assembled into phonemes or syllables, which are subjected to further pro- cessing to isolate words and even intelligible phrases. STEREOSCOPE-a virtual reality device, used in head- mounted displays and binocular omni-orientation monitors, that reproduces binocular vision. Our two eyes see the same scene from slightly different angles, and this creates an im- pression of depth, characterized geometrically by three- dimensionality. This difference in points of view can be reproduced by generating two images of the same scene from two angles, with the difference between them propor- tional to the interocular distance. These images are displayed on screens mounted side by side in such a way that each image is seen only by the corresponding eye, that is, neither eye sees both images at the same time. This gives the user a sense of depth. Because the display screens are very close to the eyes, special lenses are required for focusing. The first stereoscope was built in 1830 by Charles Wheatstone to view geometric designs in three dimensions. STEREOSCOPIC GLASSES-See shutter glasses. STEREOSCOPIC PROJECTION SCREEN-a display device used for desktop virtual reality. The stereoscopic projection screen is a variation on stereoscopic glasses (shutter glasses). Instead of alternately displaying the two images corresponding to the two angles of view typical of binocular vision, the screen displays a single image made up of zones showing what the left eye would see and zones showing what the right eye would see. A pair of passive polarizing glasses filters out the pixels not intended for each eye, and the brain synthesizes the two images into one. STREET, THE-a metaphor used by the technology culture to mean everyday life, referring in particular to the many ways, expected or unexpected, that real people use the technology available to them. STROBOSCOPE-an instrument that produces flashes of bright light that can be set at various frequencies. Strobo- scopes are particularly useful in studying moving objects. If the instrument is in phase with the observed phenomenon, the frequency of light flashes can be adjusted to make a cyclical vibration or rotation seem to freeze at a particular phase. In photography, the stroboscope makes it possible to superimpose the various phases of a movement on one nega- tive during a single exposure. The flashing of the strobe can also be adjusted to simulate slow motion. SURROGATE TRAVEL-navigation within a hypermedia pro- gram or virtual reality system that re-creates or simulates a geographical environment. Aspen Movie Map, created in 1978 by Andrew Lippman and his team at the MIT Architecture Machine Group, was the first example of a surrogate travel program. SYNTHESPIAN-See soft actor. SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR-a person responsible for keeping the connections, software and hardware that link a group of computers working properly. A network manager who mainly deals with e-mail is known as a postmaster (maitre de poste). Network managers usually handle questions and requests from network users. TACTILE FEEDBACK-the principle underlying virtual reality devices designed to provide users who "touch" objects in the virtual environment with the same sensation that would come from touching real objects. Tactile-feedback devices are currently limited to the hand, where our sense of touch 154 New Media Dictionary</page><page sequence="5">is most concentrated. They attempt to convey certain proper- ties of real objects, such as texture (roughness or smooth- ness), contour (geometry), temperature and, in some situations, movement, which are characteristic of the sensory information provided by our hands. Feedback devices for the entire body, not to be confused with datasuits, have yet to be developed. The various techniques used to reproduce the sensation of touch in the hand include pneumatic feedback (miniature air pockets), vibro-tactile feedback (voice coils, micropin or air jet arrays, memory metal actuators), electro- tactile feedback (electrical impulses with varying frequencies and amplitudes) and neuromuscular stimulation (signals sent directly to the primary cortex). TELECOMMUNICATIONS (TELECOMS)-a set of processes for communication by electromagnetic signals, using copper wire, coaxial cables and fiber optics as well as radio wave transmitters such as radios, televisions and satellites. TELECOMMUTING-the use of telecommunications and com- puter equipment to do paid work at home. TELECONFERENCING-real-time business meetings or conver- sations held over a computer network among individuals who may be widely separated. The information transmitted can be text, video or sound. TELEPUTER-a multimedia system combining the television and the computer, expected to be the eventual replacement of both. TELEROBOTICS-a field of research into remote control processes for robots. One objective of telerobotics is to create robots that can function in places that are inhospitable to humans. TELETEXT-a technique for one-way transmission of visual and graphic data using spare capacity within the band used by a television signal. A special device is needed to receive, decode and display the data. 3D SOUND-See binaural sound, "New Media Dictionary Part VII," Leonardo 36, No. 1 (2003). TOKEN BUS-a technique for controlling the information traffic on a network with a ring or bus topology. The token is a series of bits that travels continuously from node to node in a network. Any message to be transmitted from a given node must wait to receive the token. When a message is transmit- ted to the token, the token must deliver it immediately be- fore it can receive another message. TOKEN RING-See token bus. TOUR-a structured pathway offered to a hypertext or hyper- media user as a way of approaching the range of available information. Some hypertext and hypermedia programs even offer users a selection of tour profiles that provide different perspectives on the same subject. These types of pathways are found mainly in the field of education. TRACKBALL or TRACKER BALL-an input device for a desktop virtual universe. This device consists of a ball mounted on a base that has on/off controls for its various functions. The ball is equipped with force sensors that translate the pressure and movement of the user's hand into angles of view and movements of objects in the virtual environment displayed on the screen. ULTRASOUND-very high-frequency sound waves (over 20 kHz), above the range of human hearing. One property of ultrasound waves is that they are very directional. Bats and dolphins use reflected ultrasound emissions to detect obsta- cles in the dark or under water. A number of scientific imag- ing applications are based on the same principle. Medical ultrasounds, sonar (SOund NAvigation Ranging) and autofo- cus cameras all use ultrasound to measure distances and shapes. ULTRAVIOLET-part of the electromagnetic spectrum be- tween visible light and X-rays. Ultraviolet rays induce fluores- cence in a number of materials and affect most photographic substances. UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR (URL)-an addressing sys- tem used for the World Wide Web (WWW) to standardize access to the various Internet resources: Usenet, Telnet, FTP and Gopher. This practice makes it possible to use a single WWW client program to access a number of different ser- vices instead of needing a specialized program for each one. UNIVERSE-a virtual environment taken as a whole, i.e. in- cluding the hardware, software and virtual elements. URL-See uniform resource locator. USENET-an electronic bulletin board system made up of a huge collection of discussion groups, most accessed via the Internet. The system organizes the distribution of messages (articles) by classifying them according to field of interest (newsgroups). VACTOR-See soft actor. VALUE ADDED NETWORK-a data transmission network that provides certain additional services associated with data transmission (speed or character code conversion), network administration (network traffic statistics) or the data itself (data processing). VAN-See value added network. VIDEODESK-an extension of Myron Krueger's Videoplace interactive environment to a desktop format. The video camera captures the user's hand movements and generates a composite image that displays a digitized image of the user's hands over the digital information on the screen. The user can then draw, paint and select menu items using his or her hand as a cursor. VIDEOPHONE-a telephone equipped with a screen that can display a real-time picture of the person to whom the user is speaking. VIDEOPLACE-a computer-generated interactive environ- ment used for artistic and educational purposes. Videoplace is based on the principle that the computer should have ways of perceiving the user, rather than having the user actively enter data into the computer. The computer generates a composite image, combining a real-time picture of the user New Media Dictionary 155</page><page sequence="6">captured by a video camera installed in the environment with computer-generated images (mainly graphic objects) that are programmed to react to the user's actions. Some programs can provide long-distance communication between two users displayed in the same composite image in real time. Computer-generated sound can also be integrated. Video- place was constructed in 1974 by U.S. artist and computer technician Myron Krueger. Many interactive programs were developed for it, including Digital Drawing, which lets the user draw on a screen that contains his or her own image. VIDEOTEX-a technique for two-way communication over telephone lines between a service provider's computer sys- tem and a personal computer or specially adapted television set. France's Minitel terminals and TELETEL service use this technique. Videotex was invented in 1970 by British telecom- munications engineer Sam Fedida, who called it viewdata. VIRTUAL ACTOR-See soft actor. VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT-an environment created by a vir- tual reality system. VIRTUAL IMMERSION-See virtual reality, "New Media Dictio- nary Part I," Leonardo 33, No. 2 (2000). VIRTUAL REALITY MODELING LANGUAGE (VRML)-a model- ing language used to create virtual environments that can be accessed through the World Wide Web. VIRTUAL SEX-virtual reality systems that allow the user to interact sexually with various entities in the virtual environ- ment. These entities may be generated by the system itself, or they may represent other real people who are online at the same time. For the most part, virtual sex systems are desktop rather than immersive, and the feedback devices (biosensors and biostimulators) that would allow these systems to reach their full potential have not yet been perfected. VIRTUALITY-1. Strictly speaking, an impression of reality produced by computer-generated simulations to the extent that the resulting sensory perceptions are comparable to those that would actually be produced by the real or imagi- nary entities, processes or environments being simulated. 2. Broadly speaking, the quality of something that is about to happen and that is given a kind of reality contingent on its happening. VOCODER-a speech synthesizer that enables a computer to speak to the user. VOICE RECOGNITION-See speech recognition. WALK-THROUGH-a computer-generated image that is ani- mated to simulate the point of view of a person moving around in the virtual environment. WAN-See wide-area network. WEARABLE COMPUTER-a computer that can be linked to a mobile person to assist in operational situations with real- time data interpreted through such interfaces as voice recog- nition and tactile commands. The wearable computer is the product of social and technical convergences in different professional worlds (military, security, maintenance, medical monitoring, mobile communication, tourism and fashion). Performance arts have provided wearable computing a new field of experimentation in dance and circuses. Future re- search is oriented toward the integration of computing and interactive textiles. WIDE-AREA NETWORK-a communications network with nodes that are separated by great distances and that are of national or international scope. The Internet is an example of a wide-area network. WORLD GAME-a game designed by Richard Buckminster Fuller based on a computer simulation of the earth's re- sources. Players must devise the best strategies for using these resources. XANADU-a hypermedia project that would give users access to all the graphical, sound and text resources in all the li- braries in the world. This project was initiated by Ted Nelson in the 1970s, but obviously has not yet been fully realized. XCMD (external command)-an executable code module attached to a HyperCard stack in order to make a new fea- ture available. For example, an XCMD might be used to control an external device such as a CD player. XENON-a rare gas sometimes used in discharge lamps. It produces blue light when ionized. XEROX PARC-a specialized center for research and develop- ment of computer-based technologies operated by the Xerox company and located in Palo Alto, California. PARC stands for Palo Alto Research Center. The center opened in 1970 and became the Palo Alto Research Center Incorporated. XOBJECT-a program designed as an addition to Macrome- dia Director authoring software to make new features avail- able in the Macintosh environment. As its name implies, it is an object-oriented programming element. X-RAY PHOTOGRAPHY-photography using X-rays, which pass through opaque bodies instead of being reflected. X-rays are invisible to the naked eye and fall between ultravi- olet rays and gamma rays in the electromagnetic spectrum, with a wavelength of about 10-10 m. Radiography is used in medicine to examine internal organs and in industry for non-destructive testing of metal structures. In art, some artists use X-rays of the human body in their work. These are usually found objects. ZERO-a group founded in Diisseldorf in 1957 by Otto Piene and Heinz Mack, later joined by Gunther Uleker. These three artists explored ways of combining science, technology and nature. From 1957 to 1967, they also published a maga- zine (called Zero) promoting the exploration of new tech- nologies in art. References and Notes 1.
