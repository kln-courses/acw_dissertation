<plain_text><page sequence="1">Calais and Amsterdam The early work of Jean Fautrier The complementary exhibitions: Fau- trier 1925 at the Musee des Beaux-Arts, Calais (closed 19th February) and Jean Fautrier 1925-35 at the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam (to 2nd March; then at the Kunsthaus, Ziirich, 15th March to 4th May) are a revelation.* The former shows paintings and graphics from 1917 onwards with a whole corpus of work that was not included in the major Cologne retrospective at the Josef- Haubrich-Kunsthalle in 1980; the latter, with its emphasis on the periode noire, has been conceived as a 'painter's exhibition'. It is an inspiring and substantial exam- ination of the works that prompted Andre Malraux in 1933 to note Fautrier's 'almost constantly tragic resonance', due both to the artist's own nature, and to his attempt 'to push intensity of colour to an extreme and to achieve the essential through sacrifice. Each of his canvases seems violently spontaneous'. The Calais catalogue is based on the scrupulous research of Marcel-Andre Stalter, whose doctorate of 1983 has sup- plemented the pioneering critical biogra- phy by Palma Bucarelli of 1960, and Gior- gio Galansino's attempt to complete her tentative catalogue raisonne in a Chicago Ph.D. of 1973. Both Stalter's thesis and the Calais and Amsterdam exhibitions owe a great debt to Marie-Jose Lefort, director of the Galerie Jeanne Castel, whose catalogue raisonne will be pub- lished in 1987. It will, we hope, definitively answer some questions sur- rounding the mysterious 'Glacier' scenes c.1926-27 and the Inferno series of litho- graphs, c.1928-30, which preoccupied Fautrier throughout his life and which substantiate his claim as pioneer of the informel. Fautrier's artistic beginnings were aca- demic and English. It is the Glaciers, link- ing the Calais and Amsterdam exhibitions, which demonstrate most clearly the debt to Turner, Fautrier's sole passion as a child. After the death of his father, Fautrier, who had been brought up in Paris largely by an Irish Catholic grandmother went to England, and at the age of fourteen entered the Royal Acad- emy until 1915, followed by the Slade School under Sickert to 1917, the year of his mobilisation. This early work is largely 239</page><page sequence="2">EXHIBITION REVIEWS lost, but the small pastel Head of a Russian Jew, no. 3, Chelsea shown in Calais both demonstrates his accomplishment and suggests a certain milieu. Stalter publishes a note by Fautrier of 1946, claiming that he shared a studio in London with a Bel- gian actor, and though only eighteen or nineteen years old, exhibited enough to support himself with the patronage of friends such as Bernard Van Dieren, the composer, critic and future biographer of Epstein. Stalter raises the point of Fau- trier's illegitimacy and the fact that his true father may have been a Jewish art- dealer based in London. From the start Fautrier was a virtuoso and an outsider: on his return to France he could hardly speak his native tongue, such was his anglicisation since childhood. Dis- charged from the army on medical grounds in 1920, Fautrier did not base himself in Paris until 1922, though he may have started painting mountain scenes as well as portraits during his trips to the Tyrol in 1921-22. Between 1922 and 1925, however, he established himself as a Salon painter of such importance that Andre Farcy, curator of the Musee de Grenoble, named him along with Maillol, Segonzac, Braque, Lurgat and Gromaire as candi- dates 'Pour un musie franfais moderne' (Art Vivant, 1925). His companion of these years was one of Gromaire's models and Fautrier apparently took over Gromaire's studio from 1923 to 1927. While the charming brothel sketches shown at Calais recall Degas and Pascin, and were presumably commercial exer- cises, the superb very large-scale sanguine drawings of 1923, like Nu de dos (Fig.52), show the strength and intensity of Fau- trier's vision of woman. The strong mod- elling was to be translated into sculpture by 1927. Particularly interesting in this drawing is his lack of attention to head or legs, reducing the form to a central loz- enge, and the sense of the material surface as flesh, of line as caress, which continued through to the Otages period of the 1940s. Alongside these highly-charged nudes a hitherto unknown aspect of Fautrier is revealed in works such as Monsieur et Madame Edouard croitant, (Salon d'Automne, 1923; Fig.53), in which the solid modelling and sombre palette is linked both to the retour a l'ordre of Derain and Lh6te and the interest in the peuple and their argot that links Fautrier to the literary circles of Francis Carco or Celine. A series of surprising engravings from 1922-23 shows Fautrier interested in both Poe and Baudelairean melodrama (Double assassinat dans la rue Morgue and Le vin de l'assassin respectively), and, on a more realistic note, the weary and ravaged face of his sleeping concierge. By 1925 Fautrier was a highly profes- sional artist with an important one-man show behind him and a new patron in Jeanne Castel, who promoted his work faithfully for the rest of her life. Patrick Le Noeune's weighty catalogue essay estab- lishes the 1925 context: the Ecole de Paris, the boom in the market preceding the crash of the late 1930s and so on. He makes the interesting point that Fautrier was typical of a certain figurative painting in the late 1920s and central to the post- Hiroshima, existentialist, matieriste period of the 1940s. How ironic that while Fau- trier himself would promote his ante- riority as a quasi-abstract painter in the 1957 exhibition Trente ans defiguration infor- melle, it is his early realism, his unmediated expression that should now be taken up as exemplary for young painters today. The Calais catalogue, while lacking a com- plete bibliography, aspires to academic thoroughness and with a certain sleight of hand gives asterisked catalogue entry numbers and illustrations to works actu- ally lost, unavailable or in Amsterdam. Some works, like Perdreaux 1926 have been shared between the two exhibitions. Sud- denly in 1926, the debt to Vlaminck and Soutine in Fautrier's thickly impastoed still lifes gave way to expressions of horror, whose anthropomorphic overtones sub- vert the celebratory and even the contem- plative aspects of the nature morte. In a dark space haloed with grey light - no longer a dish or a table - five disembowelled small birds, plucked, helpless, almost embryo- like represent a Massacre of the Innocents - a prophetic Oradour' (Fig.56). This piriode noire is pursued in Amsterdam. Fautrier takes Chardin's rabbits and hangs them brutally by the neck in Les lapinspendus: the shreds of iden- tity, their fur and features are scratched cursorily on to a black ground. They dan- gle from a gibbet beyond the frame. The implications of torture and a certain banality, and play of victim and absent executioner point forward to the Otages. The great black boar of 1927, again sus- pended by the throat, is a bloody meta- phor for the Crucifixion. 'Mon Dieu, Mon Dieu, pourquoi m'as-tu abandonne'? was the scream of a man nailed to an X-shaped cross in a tiny engraving of 1923 shown in Calais, and the cry of the victim, the god- forsaken, echoes across Fautrier's work from the Otages, (hostage) series created during the Nazi Occupation within ear- shot of massacre, to the Budapest series of 1956. As always in Fautrier, the fascina- tion with the moment of death goes hand in hand with a disturbing eroticisation of the wound, at its most striking and explicit in L'Homme ouvert, L'autopsie, 1928-29 (Fig.55), a work of extreme fragility, trav- elling for the first time from the Donation Granville, Dijon. The series of sculptures at the Stedelijk, like Grand torse, 1928 (Fig.54), armless and with obliterated, twisted features, restores to the convention of the torso a sense of mutilation and loss; a tense adolescent pain and clumsiness reveals the link between Fautrier and the lumpy, 'unfinished' sculptures of Degas. Far before Degas in time, the headless breasts and buttocks of prehistoric Venuses are also evoked. (The Lespugue Venus, discovered in 1922, was the subject of a poem Fau- trier illustrated in 1942). Fautrier's rough, rock-like bronze surfaces of 1927-28 dra- matically anticipate the 'brutalised' sur- faces of post-war sculpture. The moment poised between life and death, between figuration and annihi- lation achieves its most monumental expression in the Inferno series of 1928, commissioned by Andre Malraux. Twenty-three of the designs in litho- graphic inks - blue, ochre, terracotta and a vivid green - are shown here, orches- trated in patterns of residual figuration. The Shades of Dante's hell advance, implore and disappear into mere stria- tions - sometimes horizontal. It is an extraordinary and unimaginable pano- ply. The Stedelijk exhibition is a triumph: very few key works of the period are miss- ing (one laments the absence of the pecu- liar suspended Christ en Croix of 1927 from the Centre Georges Pompidou). The show is hung with great drama and sobriety: three large rooms of oils are com- plemented by a succession of four small alcoves where series like the small black nudes or the 1928 oil landscapes with their hallucinatory English greens are seen to their best advantage. After major exhibitions in Hamburg (1973), Cologne (1980), Tokyo (1975, 1976, 1983), and now with the Calais initiative and the Amsterdam and Ziirich retrospective, it is time that Fautrier, perhaps Turner's tru- est disciple, was recognised in this country and the United States. The M.O.M.A. in New York sold the one minor painting they possessed before 1970; the Tate Gal- lery has apparently just purchased a few fine etchings of the 1940s. Not only does Fautrier's art embody two very different, very complex periods of European art, he is, though so intimately linked with Malraux, Francis Ponge and Georges Bataille, a painter's painter. His importance for an artist like Baselitz cannot be overestimated. Ironi- cally enough, the major collectors and admirers of Fautrier's work are German. Fautrier's black visions challenge the stri- dency of colour, the banalisation of the image of the third generation of German expressionists, so tediously over-exposed today. With his confrontation of Eros and Thanatos, torture and innocence, beauty and decay, with his rage and the sup- pression of his own virtuosity, Fautrier stands as a true non-conformist of the twentieth century, beyond the cacophony of academies and avant-gardes.
