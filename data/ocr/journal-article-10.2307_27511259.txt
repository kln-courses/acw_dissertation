<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of Religion and Health, Vol. 37, No. 3, Fall 1998 Divination, Synchronicity, and Fate STEPHEN KARCHER ABSTRACT: This is an essay in the occult, not occult philosophy but the philosophy of what we usually keep hidden, liminal, on the fringe. Divination can enlighten you, but it works through the shadows and the borderlines. Rooted in our troubles, in what "crosses our path," divination seeks its ground in a realm full of spirit. If we were to give this process a motto, it might be C. G. Jung's famous observation that "to serve a mania is detestable and undignified, but to serve a god is full of meaning" (CW 13, ?55).1 The symbolic life What is divination? What does it mean, "to divine"? The English word (which comes from the Latin divinare) links two clusters of meanings.2 One means to discover what is hidden by "supernatural" or irrational means, to see things through "magical" insight. The other means to make something divine, some thing belonging to or associated with a god. Let us start with this combina tion of meanings. Divination reveals what is hidden through irrational means. It does this by connecting us with something divine?god, spirit, an gel, daimon, or archetype. Outside of spirit-possession cults, however, the practice of divination does not involve becoming a god or spirit or archetype. It involves talking with them, participating in their identity in a complex imaginative way. A divina tion system facilitates this contact by giving you a symbol, a symbol chosen for you by the spirit involved. By interacting with the symbol your awareness is moved and changed. You learn to see things differently. You become aware of what is hidden, such as the hidden sources of events. All divination sys tems act in this way: they "provide symbols." I am using the word "symbol" in both a Jungian and a Chinese sense as an image that has the power to link the visible and the invisible. It points at something that cannot be exhausted in normal speech or thought. Stephen Karcher, Ph.D., has published an encyclopedia of divination and a guide to the use of the / Ching, as the footnotes make clear, and has lectured widely on their contents and related materials. 215 ? 1998 Blanton-Peale Institute</page><page sequence="2">216 Journal of Religion and Health A symbol is a living thing. It is both a psychic image and an attitude to wards images. We are constantly "symbolizing things," seeing greater mean ing in them than bare fact. This symbolizing is compelling. What emerges from it is "life-giving, life-enhancing" and "redeeming" (Jung, CW 6, ? 812 29).1 We participate in symbols and symbolic reality, like a dancer putting on a mask. We are fully aware of the imaginary nature of our identification at the same time we experience it as incontrovertibly real. Jung called this process of producing and interacting with symbols the Transcendent Function. Re leased from the jargon of clinical psychology, it points at how symbols have a healing function in divinatory practices. A diviner's symbols represent a language, a language that mediates human and spiritual forces. It refers to actions, to active experience, to focal points in the idea of action. This language can pick out or delineate an individual's crisis and then join that crisis with a spirit or spirit-process that sanctifies it. The situation then speaks to our feeling and our thought. We can see it, be lieve it, understand it. Here is an example of a divinatory symbol, one with a long history in both the East and West. It is one of the 64 figures of the J Ching or Classic of Change called Ting, "the Vessel." This was the symbol given to Jung when he asked the oracle to speak in its own voice in his famous Foreword to the Wilhelm-Baynes translation of the / Ching. In the East it has long been thought of as an image for the act of divination. The symbol has several dif ferent texts attached to it that expand its meaning, but the basic image is that of a bronze vessel used in sacrificial meals. It was used to prepare food for the gods, for ancestors, and noble people. The actual vessel comes from about 1000 BCE. It is often thought of as the J Ching's own persona. This vessel possesses several meanings, all implied in its name: establishing a connection with the gods; spiritual or imaginative transformation; holding on to something and cooking it; creating a receptacle or finding a concept; a secure base; the founding of a family or dynasty. It suggests that this is a time to grasp renewal, for the gentle light and warmth of awareness are spreading. You are to correct your basic stance so that you are in harmony with your fate. All these meanings and more are invoked when the vessel is presented to you as an answer to a question you have posed. The symbol Ting is meant to connect you with the spirit, archetype, or force called Ting. Your job is to "turn and roll the words in your heart," letting them break down and move the way you imagine your situation. Symbols in traditional cultures In traditional cultures the transforming and connecting power of a symbol was valued highly. Divination revealed the will of the gods in the great forces</page><page sequence="3">Stephen Karcher 217 that controlled and shaped the world It also carried a culture's myths and stories through its symbols, and gave people access to those myths. It is hard for us now to imagine the extent to which a traditional culture produces im ages, images that can carry and explain the "inner pandemonium." Divina tion was a threshold, a place where the individual and the great archetypal images could interact. Divinatory practices permeated traditional societies, producing medicines, reading omens and sky signs, judging quarrels, deter mining which were propitious moments, relaying messages from non-human powers. Political leaders could and did use divination to ensure their power, claiming the gods had set them on their thrones. But the strongest attraction in divinatory practices was individual contact with the spirits they afforded. This was both a need to act in accord with the gods and a desire to feel their presence.3 The Chinese would call this living in accord with the way or tao. Divinatory systems evolve The systems we are looking at today are extremely sophisticated imaginative instruments that represent thousands of years of refinement and change. They carry their history with them, and that history is an integral part of how they work. What we know as the J Ching began as a loose collection of omens, a shared divinatory language that goes back at least to 5000 BCE. The words and symbols of this /-language probably originated with the wu or spirit mediums who could go into trance and speak with the voice of the various spirit-beings. The language existed side by side with another form of divination that used two kinds of sticks or lines to determine whether an action was acceptable to the spirits. The line oracle is the origin of what was later called yin andyang. The first written record of the /-language occurs in the oracle bones, a vast library of the kind of pyromantic divination used by the Shang Dynasty kings (1500-1050 BCE). The Shang kings used the Fire and Bone oracle frequently, particularly in their relations with the ancestors on whom their power de pended. The new oracle The symbols of the /-language were first codified in the Chou Dynasty (1050 600 BCE). The "voice of the unconscious" or "voice of the tad" became con scious. The relations between the Shang and the Chou constitute a very im portant Chinese myth. According to this myth, the virtuous Chou rulers over threw the decadent Shang rulers and re-established a long-lost Golden Age in China. Their reign became a model for all kings to come. They were able to do this much because they had the "mandate of Heaven" {Tien ming), which had</page><page sequence="4">218 Journal of Religion and Health been taken away from the Shang because they had turned to evil. A very important part of the mandate was a new oracle, a much more effective ver sion of the language and practice of J. It was called the Chou I or "I Book of the Kings of Chou," the first form of the / Ching. The Chou I was revolutionary in many ways. It systematically combined the "yin-yang" line oracle with the language of symbols by creating six-line figures and using them to organize and display words. These figures are called gua. There are 64 of them, all possible combinations of six opened (yin) or whole (yang) lines. To access these figures, Chou diviners (particularly a figure named Wu Hsien or "Joining-together Spirit-Medium") originated a method of counting at random a set of 50 yarrow stalks to produce the num bers associated with the lines. This was explosive. It meant that instead of going into full trance, or setting up the very complicated ritual apparatus for the Fire and Bone oracle, you could know the way the spirits were moving through a simple 30-minute ritual. This made the Chou I a very important strategic tool indeed. Two other divinatory techniques soon developed. The first, the idea that any of the lines in a hexagram could spontaneously transform or turn into its opposite, lets the diviner distinguish between an overall situation and the specific point where action was occurring. This idea of transformation also generated the "Relating Hexagram" (chih gua), used to explore future devel opments or important emotional connections to the matter at hand. The second major development was in the use of eight three-line figures, the Eight Trigrams (pa gua). The hexagrams of the Chou I were seen as each composed of two of these trigrams. These eight three-line figures represent what we would call process thinking. They were used to connect the figures of the J Ching with a wide range of other systems, so that all could be accessed through divination. Each has an identity?Heaven, Earth, Thunder, Wind and Wood, Running Water, Fire and Brightness, Mountain, Mists and Marsh?and a quite elastic set of associations. Diviners could use the wide range of trigram association to analyze a situation by exploring the tension between the inner or lower element and the outer or upper element. By about 600 BCE, the Chou I had become quite sophisticated. It had the capacity to assimilate and use most other systems with which it came in contact. The people who used it, however, had changed. Professional diviners moved among the centers of power and culture. The text was now available to anyone with the ability to read. It became the central book in Chinese spiritu ality. The symbols became an integral part of culture, immediately recogniz able even outside of the context of a divination. A very "F time Over the next 500 years China fell apart. The Warring States period was a time of constant civil war, radical social change, and destabilization. This</page><page sequence="5">Stephen Karcher 219 fragmentation gave rise to the fundamental books of later Chinese culture. Among them are the Confucian classics, the Analects (Lun yu) and the Meng tz'u; the Taoist masterworks, the Lao-tz'u and the Chuang-tz'u; the utilitarian philosophy of the Legalists (Han Fei tz'u); the universal love and logical argu ments of Mo-tz'u, and the extreme individualism of Yang Chu. Because it was such a central text, each of these conflicting philosophies sought to define what the Chou I meant. The greatest battle was between the Confucians, who espoused a static, hierarchical, and moralistic philosophy, and the Taoists, whose outlook was mystical, antinomian, sacrilegious, and individual. The battle over meaning became an integral part of the book itself and ensured the book's central place in the intellectual sphere. In the midst of this chaos, other schools grew up schools that worked di rectly with the Chou I as a means of personal transformation. They intro duced something quite new?divination as an individual spiritual practice? but they saw it as the re-invention of something very old, the sage or medium's practice of attracting a helping-spirit, a shen. This idea is most clearly expressed in a treatise called the Hsi t'zu chuan (Commentary on the Attached Words) or Ta chuan (The Great Treatise). The classics and the new empire The chaos in China finally came to an end in a devastating total war, a short lived Empire (the Chin), and the ensuing stability of China's first Imperial State, the Han Dynasty (226 BCE-220 CE). After over three-hundred years of war and chaos, China was at peace. One of the first tasks undertaken by the many bureaucrats and scholars of the new government was to rectify language and establish the Ching or classics. These classics, it was felt, rep resented the wisdom of the ancient peoples and contained a very powerful magic. The first among them was the / Ching or Classic of /. The scholars, however, did more than establish the text. They collected the oral traditions that had grown up during the Warring States period, tran scribed them, and added them to the basic divinatory text as the Ten Wings (Shih I). Thus the Chou /, the divination text of the old Chou kings, became the / Ching, full of philosophical and mystical dimensions. The text of the / Ching is virtually the same today as it was in 200 BCE. Although respect and love for the symbols and the power of the / Ching per meated all of traditional Chinese culture, the text led a sort of double life. It was a fixed star in the pantheon of Confucian philosophy, knowledge of which was necessary to pass the imperial examinations. It was also a divination text consulted at all levels of culture. The use of the book spread even more widely with the advent of printing and commercial activity. In Ching, the last dynasty before the end of traditional China, virtually everyone who could read had and used a copy and there were professional diviners of a high caliber available on every street corner.</page><page sequence="6">220 Journal of Religion and Health The twist of fate The last chapter in this Odyssey occurs in this century. The use of the / Ching is now prohibited by law in the People's Republic of China, though it may be studied as a cultural treasure. It flourishes in Taiwan and other parts of the Chinese diaspora, though with a very thick overlay of Confucian moralism. But in 1927 a very important event occurred. A German Evangelical mission ary to China, who was proud of the fact that he had never actually converted a single Chinese, published a translation of the I Ching, one that for all its scholarly flaws treated the book as a living spiritual document. Shortly after this, at Keyserling's Schule der Weisheit in Darmstadt, he met a Swiss psy chologist who was passionately interested in this old Chinese book. C. G. Jung gave Richard Wilhelm's translation to Cary Baynes and asked her to translate it into English. It took her 20 years. When she was finished, the Wilhelm/Baynes version of the / Ching, with a foreword by Jung, became the largest selling university-press book in history.4 It opened a door in the West to the Classic of I, just as the East was closing. In Jung's words, it "inocu lated" us all with the living power of tao. That living spirit is "really at our gates" (Jung, CW 15, ?78).x The psychology of divining The attitudes and perspectives you need to begin center first of all on being able to "entertain" the symbols. The Ta Chuan5 says you must "turn and roll them in your heart" so that they can gather up and bring out hidden associa tions. This skill is like the symbolic participation of a mask dancer. You are convinced of the utter reality of the spirits that "enter" you at the same time that you are quite clear that this is an imaginary identity. The challenge is to let yourself be moved and changed rather than reducing the experience to a concept. The / Ching will often seem extraordinarily convincing, making deep connection with your images in one fell swoop. Your task is to let yourself think symbolically and imaginatively. Part of this comes from belief in the worth of what is hidden: you see that what is invisible is just as valuable as what is visible. Part of it is being comfortable with what our culture labels "irrational"?chance, non-causal connection, the power of intuition, the power of images. Traditional theorists of the / Ching say again and again that it is the shen or spirits that make the book work. The shen are constellated by the book's "numbers." The "numbers" (there are over 10,000 of them) are contained within the 64 divinatory figures or symbols. Each is a possible pattern of fate. When activated through consultation, these "numbers" draw down and focus the spirit. The words of the symbols then connect us with the spirit. Rather than try to rationalize this, I think we should make it part of our approach:</page><page sequence="7">Stephen Karcher 221 we all are connected to an invisible spirit that like a Greek daimon is both inside and outside us. Divination facilitates communication with this spirit. It is a gift of these spirits, an expression of their friendship and concern. As we have seen, a divination system provides symbols. It offers a certain symbol to a certain person at a certain time. The moment, the complex of time that includes the inquirer, empowers the symbol. The moment belongs to a certain kind of time. For many traditional peoples, what we call the "future" belongs to a special order, a metaphysical order of being that we might call "what is out there in front of me" or "what is hidden." It denotes what is in the process of manifest ing itself. This category contains more than the future, it contains all that exists in the heart and mind: desire, emotion and thought striving towards manifestation. The symbol establishes a continuity between what you are and the world of desire, the thought at the heart of things. It translates you into this order. This order is often thought of as a great river flowing from the future to wards the past. The moment "now" is a threshold of manifestation where what is potential begins to become actual. Symbols move on this river of time. The oracle presents you with the one that is approaching you. It is potential, the seed of things to come. Chance The key element chance links your question, the symbol that answers it, and the spirit or daimon. We think of chance as "meaningless co-incidence" or "random activity." Traditional cultures saw it as the work of the gods and spirits. Jung saw it as the engine of what he called synchronicity or acausal connection, a form of experience in which time and space are relative. Chance, its friend chaos, and their offspring, synchronicity, are windows into a paradisiacal state that myths often call the Golden Age. As syn chronicity, chance opens a space in the imagination, a symbolic field where time and space are fluid and anything goes. What happens there puts you in touch with the Other. Many ancient peoples have thought that the spirits or daimons do not have human language. Choosing a divinatory symbol gives them a voice. But the contact occurs only if something besides the human ego does the choosing. Chance lets the spirit decide. It links the spirit, the symbol, and the inquirer. Daimon and devil The words "daimon" and "devil" point at something else. They carry the dark side of divination. Divining has always been a borderline activity. An encoun</page><page sequence="8">222 Journal of Religion and Health ter with the unknown, it works and sees through shadows, outside the "nor mal" world. The diviner seeks the source of something that is in itself obscure. This figure is strange?liminal, outcast, blind, lame, disfigured, transsexual, an eternal stranger. It is precisely through his experience as an outcast that the diviner can help the temporary outsiders and deviants who come to him as clients. The traditional diviner is a daimonic man. He works with what breaks the fabric of life and belief. Traditional divination is a daimonic activ ity. Its healing powers are directly connected with this subversive and reju venating energy. In pagan antiquity, the kind of spirit we call daimon?a mediating spirit involved in the events of everyday life?sponsored divination as well as a whole range of other imaginative practices that provided an experience of the gods. The daimons are mediators. They connect us to the inner and the outer world. Sometimes quite painfully, they keep us in contact. In late antiquity, however, as part of a great drive towards monotheism and the Kingdom of Heaven, the daimons were turned into devils, demonized through the inven tion of evil. The final anathema was proclaimed in 391 CE. The pagan gods were judged to be fallen angels and thus in league with the Devil and the minions of Hell. All divinatory practices, which they sponsored, were made a capital crime. This attitude, one that would "make every thought a prisoner for Christ," is behind the strange resistance to divinatory practices we often meet, even if the fear is cloaked in ridicule and scorn. It makes us afraid of our own imag ination or of letting the living world around us have a voice. The daimons mediate the world to us. They help us to speak to our soul. Without the kind of spirit they represent, a living spirit that speaks in the events of everyday life, we live in a much impoverished and dangerous world.6 I want to suggest that there is a therapeutic aspect in our interest in di vination. But it is not just therapy for us. By allowing us to give voice to the "others" within us and around us, divination helps us return something pre cious to the wonderful and mysterious world in which we live. Seven words from the classic of change Divination, both practical and religious, was an integral part of life in tradi tional China. It ranged from blocks tossed to say Yes or No to spirit-mediums and "wisdom-divination" associated with spiritual practices. This concern goes back to China's pre-history. It gave rise to a view of divination as a "way" of spiritual transformation. I would like to look at seven key words from the J Ching as an example of this way or tao of divining. All these words are quite important. They have long and often conflicted histories and represent impor tant clusters or complexes of thought and feeling.</page><page sequence="9">Stephen Karcher 223 Tao Tao means "way" or "path." In its oldest uses it denotes either a literal road or the life and code of behavior of a particular kind of person: a carpenter's tao, a wife's tao, a warrior's tao. It developed into the most fundamental, the most mysterious, and the most attractive term in Eastern thought. Tao has been called the "on-going process of the real." It permeates, sup ports, and changes everything in the world while itself remaining unchanged. It is a great mysterious flow of energy that animates and shapes all things. It offers a path or way?an identity?to each thing in the world. The great mystery of tao is that it is individual and particular and all-encompassing at the same time. Though not at all anthropomorphic, tao has very high reli gious or spiritual value. To be "in" tao is to experience meaning. It is conceived of as the highest good. It brings joy, connection, spontaneity, creativity, and compassion. The basic divinatory signs of the / Ching reflect this: "the way is open" or "the way is shut." Te Te, which I translate as power and virtue, is another very old word. It is closely associated with tao, as in the famous book the Tao Te Ching or Way Power Classic, also known as the Lao-tz'u. Te is the power or virtue that allows a thing to exist fully. Both things and people have te. In the human world, the oldest meaning would be the cha risma or inner power that makes a "great person," a tajen. Someone full of te is quite numinous. This numinosity evolved into something like "the power or ability to realize tao in your person," that is to realize (make actual) the pat tern that is offered to you by tao. The emphasis was on ways to accumulate and store this power until a "critical mass" was reached and your personality was transformed. The oracle was a way to accumulate te. Chun Tz'u The term chun tz'u or realizing person is an ideal of conduct and self-realiza tion. I read its basic meaning as "the person who uses the oracle to follow the tao and thus accumulate the power and virtue (te) to become who he or she was intrinsically meant to be." The oldest meaning of the term is "nobleman." We see pictures of this chun tz'u in the Book of Poetry, dating back at least to 1000 BCE and the "Golden Age" of the Chou. The poems are very beautiful and graceful and the portrait of the nobleman striking. He is not simply pow erful. He is beautiful, desirable, highly skilled and quite refined, capable of</page><page sequence="10">224 Journal of Religion and Health profound thought, noble behavior, and self-sacrifice. There is a numinous glow around him that represents te: this is someone who fully expresses what it is to be human. About 400 BCE a particular philosophical sect, Confucianism, appropriated and re-defined chun t'zu. They turned it into a moral term, whereby it came to mean someone who was perfected in Confucian moral discipline. Confucius idealized a particular historical period, the early or Eastern Chou (1100-c. 700 BCE). He tried to "reconstruct" its rites and rituals as a new basis for moral behavior. His moral discipline consisted of introjecting this set of rules and rituals until they became automatic. This was the Confucian definition of "being in tao? It re-created the tao of the early Golden Age. Someone who was in tao was "superior" to those around him and deserved to rule them. Thus the common western translation, "superior man." Confucians also es tablished the hierarchical and cosmological superiority of man over woman and yang over yin, and projected this into society as a whole, insisting on complete social stasis. These two meanings, "morally superior Confucian" and "one who uses the oracle to realize him or herself," as well as the shadow of the numinous nobleman, all exist in the word chun t'zu. The kuei shen These ghosts and spirits represent the kind of non-human beings, the psychic complexes, that we encounter in divination. Their interaction can give us a profound insight into how the psychology of spiritual divination works. Kuei and shen are opposites, as yin and yang are opposites: their opposed natures are actually complementary. They represent realms or kinds of expe rience that connect directly to our psyche. The Chinese think we have two kinds of souls, hun and p'o. The hun or yang soul rises at death to become shen, while the p'o or yin soul goes into the earth and the tomb where, if it is angered or offended, it may become a kuei. Shen is a "bright spirit," very potent and very mobile. In the oldest thought, shen existed outside the individual. Sages went through elaborate ceremonies to induce the shen to take up residence in their bodies. Through such in dwelling they acquired a helping-spirit. The shen confers intensity, clarity, and depth on the soul. The shen make the oracle work and are "conjured" by its numbers. Kuei are quite different. If shen make the oracle work, the kuei are the problems it confronts. Contrary to shen, kuei do not like to move. They are dark earth-bound spirits, malevolent ghosts that become active through an ger, insult, and injury. They represent compulsive negative emotions and pain. Kuei can easily poison a person or a situation, spreading contagion. They can cause a paralysis of the personality that leads to bodily or spiritual death. On a moral level, they represent a deep negativity, pain, and anger</page><page sequence="11">Stephen Karcher 225 that we must come to grips with. Kuei are implacable. Once activated or con stellated, they must be dealt with through propitiation or exorcism. The job of the oracle is to move the kuei, to transform the fixed emotion, so that the process of living can go on. The act of consultation focuses the bright spirit of the shen directly onto the problem, the heart of the dark bound-up kuei. This is a conjunction of yin and yang. It offers the knot of pain and compulsion a chance to be seen, mirrored in the symbolic order. It brings to light what is hidden and offers ways to deal with it in everyday life. It trans forms the problem. As the past comes to light, we are released from compul sive emotions. Hsiang Hsiang is the word for symbol, the tool used by the shen to move the kuei. As we have seen, a symbol has the power to connect things, to connect visible and invisible worlds. In this sense, the 64 figures of the / Ching are all hsiang, and were created by a kind of imaginative induction that is also called hsiang. Like other Chinese characters, hsiang is also a verb. We can use the oracle to hsiang something and turn it into a symbol. A hsiang is also a magic spell, a form, figure, or likeness and a pattern or model. You can hsiang?carry on the symbolic process?by creating an image, imitating something so that you become its image, by acting, playing, or writing. This leads to an important conclusion: we make the connection between the invisi ble world of the spirit and the visible world of our lives by playing with the symbols, by imitating them, by acting them out. Ming This word means both fate and mandate. It emerges from the transformation of the kuei. The term's two meanings are both quite old; they interconnect in a special way. As fate, ming shows us an individual destiny, marked off by the great limits of birth and death, given texture by character and articulated through significant meetings. This fate is not implacable. But it is very hard to see, buried as it is in the body and the unconscious. As mandate, ming shows us a clear command from on high, from Tien or Heaven. It gives us the ability to speak with authority, to be the voice of the gods. Heaven's mandate (Tien ming) is a very important phrase. It is not just the power given by Heaven to an Emperor. It is an in-dwelling part of each of us, the heaven within us. In the process of divination and symbolic perception, imaginative play con nects two meanings. Through using the oracle and working with its symbols you learn to see clearly, to recognize what heaven asks of you. You transform</page><page sequence="12">226 Journal of Religion and Health your fate into a mandate from heaven. You can be fully yourself and live in the tao. Change I or yi, usually translated as change, is the most mysterious word of all. It is the name of the book and represents what it does and how it does it. /, the book, and /, the process, contain many kinds of change. There are models of the orderly changes in nature, like the seasons or the stages of life, models of predictable transformations, like water turning to ice, a caterpillar turning into a butterfly or a live person turning into a dead person, and cyclic alterna tion, like day turning to night or yin turning to yang. I is something different. Its primary meaning is "trouble." It was first used to indicate sudden disastrous storms, unexpected losses, or political up heaval. Confusion intervenes. What was thought to be stable suddenly be comes fluid. Structures break down; something extraordinary happens. The world one way or another reverts to chaos. The second meaning of / shows the response to this kind of trouble: ver satility, imaginative mobility, openness, and ease. It suggests a fluid personal identity, a fertile imagination, and the capacity to move with destabilizing change. It is as mysterious, unpredictable, and fertile as the tao. Through I, the book tells us, we can move as fluidly and unpredictably as the chaotic force it represents, never rigid, never fixed. The spirits and the symbols that make up its "way" or tao will connect the I of the universe to our own J, our creative imagination, if we choose to use them. Reference Notes 1. C. G.

Eric Partridge in Origins: A Short Etymological Dictionary of the English Language (London: Routledge, 1958 [1982]) links diva (Latin divus or spirit), divine, divination, and divinity, all coming from the Latin dius, the adjective of deus, a god. Divination is linked particularly with divinare (to make something divine) and the "god-inspired" divinus and divinitas. In Latin, the Romance languages, and English, "divine" meaning "divination," and "divine" meaning "god," are very close indeed. 3.

The problem of how to translate divinatory symbols is a paradigm for the conflict over the nature and importance of the imag ination. 5. The Ta chuan or Hsi tz'u chuan (the Great Treatise or Commentary on the Attached Words) is our primary Chinese source for divination as a spiritual practice. It is one of the most impor tant documents in the history not only of the Chinese but of world religion. This treatise makes up two of the Ten Wings added to the divinatory text in the early Han Dynasty (c. 200 BCE). It was probably first elaborated as an oral teaching passed from master to student. There are currently no good translations of the Ta chuan. The Wilhelm-Baynes J Ching con tains an extremely flawed and outdated version. Richard John Lynn's The Classic of Change: The I Ching as interpreted by Wang Bi (New York: Columbia University Press, 1994) contains a moralistic interpretation by the first Confucian dogmatist. I recommend my own Ta chuan: The Great Treatise, forthcoming from Element. Willard Peterson's article "Making Connec tions: The Commentary on the Attached Verbalizations from the Book of Change," Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies, 42/1, June 1992, is a superb examination of the very radical spiri tual position taken in the Treatise. It is the only intelligent treatment in the literature, I think. 6. Theodosius took the final step in outlawing all pagan religious practices in 391 CE, while Gregory of Nazianzus coined the famous "take every thought a prisoner for Christ," several generations earlier. Though he did not originate it, it was Augustine who most fully articu lated the polemical stance that the "the gods of the pagans are demons" in his immensely influential De civitatus Dei. Modern depth psychologists and cultural historians emphasize that this split was not only historically decisive; it goes on in each of us every day. The work of James Hillman, including the essay "Peaks and Vales" in Puer Papers (Irving, TX: Spring Publications, 1979), is the most articulate formation of this idea. The most incisive historian on the difference between the world of the pagan daimons and the world of the Christian angels is Robin Lane Fox, Pagans and Christians, (New York: Alfred Knopf, 1987).</page></plain_text>
