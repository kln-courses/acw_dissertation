Printed in the Netherlands. Two years after publishing his first Critique, Kant offered the philosophical world his Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics as something of a popularized version of the argument contained in the former work. While there are variations in the Prolegomena from both editions of The Critique of Pure Reason, it basically follows the same development of thought and presents the same conclusions. The way these conclusions are presented, however, both in concept and vocabulary, is occasionally quite distinct. This is especially true with respect to the "con- clusions" of the Prolegomena, wherein his treatment of the limitations which must be placed on metaphysics in general and natural theology in particular are set forth. What is of special interest here is the specific way Kant discusses the distinction between "the bounds" and "the limits" of pure reason as they pertain to what can be known and said about God, and his introduction of the notion of analogy as a means of understanding the "positive" aspect of his overall negative conclusions concerning natural theology. I am particularly interested in his remarks on these topics to the degree that they might provide a way of overcoming the strong dichotomies established by Kant himself between the phenomenal and noumenal worlds. In this manner perhaps the scepticism and/or existentialism, as well as the limited humanism, which are traditionally said to follow from Kant's philosophy, can be seen as mere interpretational alternatives. I Kant begins his conclusions to the Prolegomena (all page references will be to the 1951 Liberal Arts Press edition, ed. by Lewis W. Beck) by suggesting that just as it would be absurd to hope for knowledge of things in themselves beyond the cate- gories of the understanding, so it would be a "greater absurdity" to fail to acknow- ledge the existence of such realities, "for this would be to wish to have the prin- ciples of the possibility of experience considered universal conditions of things in themselves . . ." resulting in these principles becoming "transcendent" (p. 99). It 19</page><page sequence="2">20 would seem, incidentally, that this is a passage which Fichte, Hegel, Schopenhauer, and even Emerson would have done well to ponder at some length. Next, Kant admits that although the human mind cannot know, content-wise, beyond all possible experience, we cannot abstain entirely from seeking to do so, since "experience never satisfies reason fully." Here he acknowledges what some have called the "metaphysical urge," the desire to find some substantive, rather than merely formal, reality amidst the fog banks that lie beyond the shoreline of what in the first Critique Kant termed "the island of truth," bounded by the cate- gories of the understanding. There, Kant seems intent on playing a kind of philo- sophical "catcher in the rye," saving would-be metaphysicians from certain suicide by drowning. Here, he seems more open to entertaining the possibility that such excursions may not be fatal after all. This possibility seems to hinge, at least in part, on the distinction made in the Prolegomena (p. 101) between "the bounds of reason" and "the limits of reason," a distinction which Kant does not, to my knowledge, make in the first critique. Bounds, according to Kant, "always presuppose a space existing outside a certain definite place and inclosing it," mich like a fence or the walls of a room. Bounds are impositions which confine the range of our activity from without, they crowd us in. Limits, on the other hand, "are mere negations which affect a quantity so far as it is not absolutely complete, perhaps as a tether or an horizon might restrict our range of activity or vision from within our standpoint, so to speak. Now, human reason experiences the restrictions provided by the categories of the understanding as limits when it is working in the areas of formal and empirical science, but as bounds with respect to the things in themselves. In the former case, there is no incompleteness in principle or quality but only in quantity regarding what can be known, while in the latter case this is not true; thus in the latter case the very incompleteness suggests something beyond itself. As Kant says: "Meta- physics leads us towards bounds in the dialectical attempts at pure reason, not undertaken arbitrarily . . . but stimulated thereto by the nature of reason itself." It is nature itself that has endowed us with the predisposition to seek "not only the bounds of the use of pure reason, but also the way to determine them" (p. 102). In Kant's view then, it is the transcendental Ideas (of God, freedom, and im- mortality), which we can neither keep from thinking nor ever give content to, that lead us, not only to the acknowledgement of the reality of the bounds of reason, but to their location and nature as well. The very existence of such ideas leads us to "the spot" where experience, structured by the categories of the understanding as the phenomenal world, "touches the void (that of which we can know nothing, namely noumena)" (p. 103). Kant's use of embodied kinesthetic, and tactile meta- phors at this juncture is especially interesting in its own right and we shall have opportunity to return to it before finishing up. The main point here is that whereas limits are experienced exclusively as nega- tions, bounds carry as well a positive significance. The point at which what we know, phenomenal reality, "connects" with what we do not know, noumenal reality, is the point at which we are rationally forced to think the transcendental</page><page sequence="3">21 Ideas even though we can never rationally know them, content-wise. These Ideas necessitate positing the existence of the noumena, of things in themselves, beyond our experiences within the phenomenal worls because they "actually have reference to something distinct from them . . . , as appearances always presuppose an object in itself and therefore suggest its existence whether we can know of it or not" (p. 103). At this point Kant introduces a distinction between deism, a la Hume, on the one hand, and two kinds of theism on the other. It is clear that he wants to go further than Hume by making room for some form of natural theology, even though it is generally thought that apart from the ethical structure of practical reason Kant saw no place whatsoever for a rational approach to religion. Kant accepts Hume's critique of all attempts to project human characteristics onto the divine nature on the basis of "dogmatic anthropomorphism" as simply futile exercises in transcendent metaphysics (p. 105). However, he goes on to maintain that a transcendental metaphysics, one which engages in "symbolical anthropo- morphism" is not only viable but is necessitated by the nature of reason itself (p. 106). Dogmatic anthropomorphism is avoided by refraining from attributing the phenomena of human nature and experience directly to the noumenal divine reality. But if "we attribute them to the realtion of this Being to the world and allow ourselves a symbolical anthropomorphism" we focus, according to Kant, on "language only and not the object itself (p. 106). It is this focus on rationality and language which I want to examine more closely presently, but first a few words on the difference between this move and that made by Kant in his critiques of pure and practical reason. Traditionally, Kant is interpreted, and not without good reason, as eliminating religion from the realm of pure reason and confining it to the realm of practical reason alone. As he says near the end of the first Critique, "I have set aside reason in order to make room for faith." It is this basic dichotomy, grounded in the absolute separation between the phenomena and the noumena, that has given rise to the split which has dominated contemporary philosophy until very recently, namely that between analytic and existentialist thought. Currently, however, there is a growing number of thinkers on both sides of this split engaged in the explor- ation of ways to overcome it. Those who interpret Wittgenstein as a phen- omenologist,1 together with those who interpret phenomenology linguistically,2 are especially suggestive in this regard. What is needed, it would seem, is a deeper understanding of the symbolic relation between thought and action on the one hand, as well as between language and reality on the other. Now here, in the Prolegomena, we find Kant himself speaking in ways that suggest these very notions, albeit somewhat cryptically. It is time to take a closer look. The basis of Kant's "chastened" theism lies in the distinction between dogmatic and symbolical anthropomorphism; the latter only attributes characteristics of human experience to the relation of God to the world, not to God's nature as such,</page><page sequence="4">22 and thus is concerned with language rather than noumenal reality. At this point (p. 106), Kant enters into a fairly detailed discussion of analogical predication, one which is extremely reminiscent of Aquinas' treatment of the same subject. To speak of God as "Supreme Understanding and Will," in relation to the world is not to convey knowledge of divinity as it is in itself, but only as it is known to us, just as to speak of a shipbuilder or a commander as wise and powerful, respec- tively, says nothing about them as such but only in relation to their ship or their regiment. Such a cognition is one of analogy and does not signify (as is commonly understood) an imperfect similarity of two things, but a perfect similarity of relations between two quite dissimilar things. By means of this analogy, however, there remains a concept of the Supreme Being sufficiently deter- mined for us, though we have left out everything that could determine it absolutely or in itself, for we determine it as regards the world and hence as regards ourselves, and more do we not require (p. 106). This shift from the idea of analogy to attribution to that of analogy of rela- tionality is quite parallel to Aquinas' shift to the "analogy of proportionality." In fact, in a footnote on the above quoted paragraph, Kant actually speaks in a manner that could be mistaken as coming directly from Aquinas' own pen. Not only does he stress the "as with this, so with that, each as it is appropriate to its own nature" pattern, but he even focuses on the relationship of causation as the crucial similarity. For instance, as the promotion of the welfare of children (= a) is to the love of parents (= b), so the welfare of the human species (= c) is to that un- known character in God (= X), which we call love; not as if it had the least similarity to any human inclination, but because we can suppose its relation to the world to be similar to that which things of the world bear one another. But the concept of relation in this case is a mere category, namely, the con- cept of cause, which has nothing to do with similarity (p. 106)- On this basis Kant moves beyond the limited deism allowed by Hume to a theism which still avoids attributing human characteristics to divinity. For his brand of theism only speaks of God on the basis of analogies drawn from the categories of the understanding in a formal rather than a material fashion. Rationality, for instance, is attributed to God, not directly and per se, but as the ground of ration- ality as it is experienced in the world. Thus we speak of the world as if its existence and nature are the result of the wisdom of a Supreme Being by analogically trans- ferring the ground of causal relationships from this world to its source. Kant calls this chastened or critical theism "the true mean between dogmatism, which Hume combats, and skepticism, which he would substitute for it" (p. 103). Kant continues to develop the spatial and kinesthetic metaphor of a boundary, which differs markedly from the static and passive imagery of the first Critique, in order to underscore his contention that the brand of theism he is promoting</page><page sequence="5">23 signifies a positive cognitive dimension as well as a negative one. He stresses the point that a boundary "belongs to that which lies within as well as to the space that lies without" itself and thus yields "an actual positive cognition" when reason "acquires by enlarging itself to this boundary" (p. 109). The bounds of reason constitute a relation between the phenomenal reality of experience and the nou- menal reality beyond our experience. It is in this way that Kant lays the foundation for a viable natural theology. Using the positive, relational cognition derived from the boundary between the noumena and the phenomena, natural theology can, indeed must, posit a Supreme Being as the "cause" of the world of sense "in order to guide the use of reason within it according to principles of the greatest possible (theoretical as well as practical) unity . . . though only of course by analogy" (p. 110). As I indicated earlier on, it will prove helpful to return to Kant's use of the metaphorical and analogical modes before we are finished. For at the very least this constitutes the unique contribution of the Prolegomena vis a vis natural theology, while at the most it may well provide a fulcrum for initiating, a fresh approach to this time- worn topic. By way of wrapping up his considerations of this general topic, Kant begins by summarizing the positive results of natural theology in terminology which would lead anyone familiar with contemporary theology to think it has come from the pen of Paul Tillich. He reaffirms the limited character of our reasoning about God and then says: But this limitation does not prevent reason from leading us to the objective boundary of experience, namely, to the relation to something which is not itself an object of experience but is the ground of all experience. Reason does not, however, teach us anything concerning the thing in itself; it only instructs us as regards its own complete and highest use in the field of possible experience (p. 1 10). Kant allows himself to speculate, not metaphysically but "anthropologically," as to the purpose of our being endowed with the disposition to transcend the phenom- enal world. He concludes that the transcendental Ideas serve to free us from limited human experience not for contemplative and speculative ends, "but in order that practical principles may be assumed as at least possible; for practical principles, unless they find scope for their necessary expectation and hope, could not expand to the universality which reason unavoidably requires from a moral point of view" (p. 111). A bit further on he suggests that the Idea of a Supreme Being, in par- ticular, as intelligent cause destroys materialism, naturalism, and fatalism, thus affording "scope for the moral Ideas beyond the field of speculation" (p. 1 12). Here we see Kant providing the transition between his first and second Crit- iques, between pure reason and practical reason. The standard interpretation at this juncture, and surely the Critiques themselves (as well as The Foundations of the Metaphysics of Morals and Religion Within the Bounds of Reason Alone) give ample basis for this interpretation, is familiar enough. Pure reason provides no</page><page sequence="6">24 ground whatsoever for metaphysics and theology, while practical reason requires, in some sense, the "postulating" of the reality of God, freedom, and immortality. Yet, here in the Prolegomena we find Kant exploring metaphors and speaking of analogies in a manner that might suggest a more integral connection between the pure and the practical dimensions of experience and rationality. In the second section of this paper I wish to return to some of these highly interesting and hope- fully fruitful possibilities. II Let us begin with Kant's rather extensive and straightforward use of metaphor and analogy by way of developing the positive aspect of his approach to natural theology. Although he, as well as nearly all those who consider themselves "modern," generally speaks condescendingly of "mere metaphor" and "only analogy," in this section of the Prolegomena Kant never really apologizes for relying on such informal and imprecise means of presenting and arguing for his conclusion. In my opinion this represents a strength rather than a weakness in his posture. For I am convinced, partly as a result of noting it in such great thinkers as Kant himself, that when we reach the deepest level of thought it is the metaphoric mode that best enables us to deal with the issues at hand. This is not an unfortunate limitation, but is rather appropriate to and necessitated by the complexity and comprehensiveness of deepest truth. Kant's fundamental distinction between bounds and limits, together with his subsequent development of it in terms of the former providing a positive cognition of the reality of the noumenal realm and divine existence, is of special interest. This is so because it represents a rather sudden shift from the predominance of passive and static images that characterizes his previous accounts of such matters, especially in the first Critique. The categories of the understanding, which constitute the bounds of reason, are nearly always treated in terms which imply limited or no activity on the part of the knower. In spite of the fact that the hallmark of Kantian philosophy is its emphasis on the active part the mind plays in shaping experienced reality, it remains true that Kant's treatment of the structure and structuring of the mind is itself characterized by such images as eyeglasses, filter systems, and passive sense perception. Thus Kant's image of boundaries which are approached through space and whose surface is contacted by the embodied knower is a rather remarkable and, I must add, welcome departure from his usual visual perspective. For far too long the history of Western thought, at least since Plato, has been dominated by the root metaphor of knowledge being a kind of passive visual experience of the real. Kant has strongly contributed to this tradition, and thus his employment of moitkines- thetic and tactile images is an important development, indeed. The major difficulty is that he did not explore this possibility far enough, nor in the right direction. The same potential arises when, in speaking about analogical speech about God, he men- tions the cruciality of relationship , but once again he lets it drop.</page><page sequence="7">25 What is needed precisely at this juncture, in my view, is an extension of this active, embodiment motif so as to construe our relationship with reality as inter- actional rather than observational. Following Kant's "hints," I would propose thinking of the knower and the known as inextricably connected, as two dancers holding hands and moving in the dark. As one dancer, the knower is unable to extricate him or herself from the dance in order to confront the other dancer, reality, directly as a "thing in itself." Nor is the knower able simply to create any type of dance he or she wishes, for reality has an agenda of its own, as well. Never- theless, through interactive cooperation, conflict, and resolution, the two together create the world as we know it, and thus the knower comes "to know" reality.3 The same issue arises when Kant speaks of our reasoning analogically from the world to its cause as we do from a watch or ship to its maker. He focuses here on the relationship between the artifact and the creator, and in passing mentions that relationship between a "regiment and its commander." What is surprising, however, is that Kant never notices that while the relationship in the former, more traditional cases is a one-way, causal and thus passive one from the point of view of that which is made, in the latter case this is not true. A commander does not cause or create a regiment in a one-way fashion; rather, the relationship between them is an interactive, personal one that far exceeds the limitations of mere causal connections. Kant would have been well-advised to pursue this example more thoroughly. The significance of all this for our purposes here is indeed considerable. Clearly, the results of one's approach to natural theology are going to be different depending on the sort of root metaphor one begins with. Kant's overall commit- ment to a visual metaphor leads him to an interpretation of the bounds of reason whose inherent passivity and staticity renders the cognitive gulf between the human and the divine essentially unbridgeable. Had he followed up on his more interactive motif, employing movement and touch, he might have been able to develop an interpretation of the bounds of reason which enables our knowledge of reality, including God, to be more relational and positive. The epistemic distance inherent in the visual metaphor of cognition is essentially avoided in a more kinesthetic and tactile metaphor. Error, here, is seen more as a false or surprise move, as the unhappy result of a dialectical process of cognition which involves interpretive and observational activity as symbolically interrelated. If we begin by assuming a gap between the knower and the known, between ourselves and reality, and then set about to devise ways of overcoming this gap, Kant's approach is about as helpful as one can find. What, it must be asked, is the rationale for such an initial assumption? It is, of course, necessary to avoid anthro- pomorphism in anything like the literal sense when speaking of God. However, does the choice between literalism and silence exhaust the possibilities? Given the Judeo- Christian belief in the image of God in human nature, as well as the created structure of the world, it would seem more likely and profitable to begin by assuming an interactive relationship between ourselves and God. Speaking strictly in a philosophical sense, given the fact that our basic way of</page><page sequence="8">26 being in and understanding the world is by means of interacting with it corporately and corporially, it would seem most productive to begin by defining reality and our knowledge of it in terms of increasingly complex and comprehensive dimensions of "experienced reality," rather than by stratifying it into a this-worldly realm and a transcendent realm from the start. Then the problem of our knowledge of "things in themselves" simply would never arise, since it would be seen from the outset to be a pseudo-problem. For, if noumenal reality is defined as essentially independent of our minds, then our knowledge of it is out of the question from the beginning. The whole issue reduces to a matter of how we are to conceive of the relationship between the knower and the known. On the face of it, it would seem that the knower and that which is known must be in some form of interactive relationship to each other. The very nature of the knowing process, from the way infants seek meaning and knowledge through move- ment and oral-tactile grasping, to Heisenburg's principle of indeterminacy which calls attention to the symbiotic character of knowledge and reality at the sub- atomic level, necessitates a non-passive, non-static understanding of the relation between the knower and the known. What we know is constituted by the inter- action between what there is to be known and our efforts to know it. Why should it be thought to be otherwise? Kant had it right when he insisted on the active nature of the human mind, but he failed to see that when the issue is approached from this direction the concept of "things in themselves" has no function whatsoever. There is nothing left un- explained or unknown; what we can know we know through interaction, and what we cannot know we have no need or way to talk about. This is neither a limitation nor a lack, it is simply the nature of human cognition. We are led into thinking that we are somehow falling short of true knowledge by first positing "things in them- selves" and then lamenting that we cannot know them. We overlook the fact that our very act of positing such a notion is itself a function of human cognition; the concept of "unknowable knowledge" is meaningless at best and counter-productive at worst. To put it differently, the very distinction Kant makes between how things are "in themselves" and how they are known "by us" is itself made within the structures and functions of human cognitive activity. So, in an important sense, even "things in themselves" only have meaning in relation to our knowledge of them. My own suggestion is that this whole problem of the knowledge of "things in themselves," both in Kant and in a large portion of Western epistemology, derives from what Wittgenstein termed "a one-sided diet." By focusing on our perceptual knowledge of physical objects as the paradigm case of cognition, we are led to the mistaken idea that the known is and remains whatever it is, independent of any interaction with us, the knowers. The truth of the matter is, that quite apart from the fact that such an account of physical reality and knowledge is highly question- able, the vast majority of our knowledge is of much more complex, intangible, and relational dimensions. Language, history, persons, aesthetic and moral values, politics, and religion are all clearly relational realities about which it makes no sense</page><page sequence="9">27 whatsoever to speak of what is known as being and remaining what it is apart from the interaction of the knower. Persons, to take the most relevant example, are not who and what they are independently of their interaction with one another. A person is a friendly person (or a "slow learner," or a "nigger") largely because and as they are related to as such. Moreover, we become persons by entering into relationship with other persons, and vice versa. Had Kant and others taken such relational realities as their model, it might never have occurred to them to speak of the "thing in itself independently of its inter- active relationship with those cognitive agents whose participation in them con- stitute both their nature and the knowledge of them. This is especially true of the knowledge of God. By far the dominant tradition in Western philosophy and theology alike has defined God more in terms of abstract, static forms, unmoved movers, mathematical concepts, etc. than in terms of persons, processes, and relationships. This is, incidentally, a very unbiblical, unHebraic Greek tendency that has taken over Western thought. The point here is that Kant was caught up in this tradition and thus failed to see both the pitfalls to which it leads and the possi- bilities provided by a relational understanding of both reality and knowledge. To come at this whole issue from a different, yet equally viable angle, much of the difficulty arises from Kant's rigid dichotomy between the two functions or types of reasoning, pure and practical His whole philosophic posture is predicted on keeping these two dimensions of human existence quite separate, pure or theoretic reason involving cognition and practical, moral reason involving volition. As I mentioned earlier on, it is this dichotomy which has led to the fact/value split that so thoroughly permeates the modern mind and is especially well focused in the antagonism between analytic and existentialist thought. The former is based broadly on Kant's first Critique and the latter on his second Critique, but they both accept the initial separation between pure and practical reason. Kant himself, here in the "Conclusion" of the Prolegomena , makes some moves which could perhaps form the basis for a reproachment between these two equally essential dimensions of human life, but he does not follow through with them. He specifically addresses this possibility when he suggests that the purpose of our "metaphysical urge" is to guide the use of reason within the phenomenal world "according to principles of the greatest possible (theoretical as well as practical) unity" (p. 1 10). He goes on to conclude that only by means of the transcendental Ideas (of God, freedom, and immortality) are the principles of practical reason able to provide the universality necessary for a rational basis of moral activity (p. Ill, 112). However, Kant is never really able to coordinate this connection ox unity between the two types of reason because he began by defining them as essentially separate. Here again, we might well ask why it was necessary to set things up this way at the outset. In addition to the obvious fact that in our everyday experience these two dimen- sions of life are not separable, there are several philosophical reasons for objecting to this epistemological dualism. As many thinkers have made abundantly clear in recent decades,4 obtaining knowledge about the world is not a simple matter of</page><page sequence="10">28 examining "the facts" without reference to various prior commitments, both theoretical and valuational. The facts we get are in large measure a function of the questions we ask, as the issue of whether light is "really" particles or waves clearly indicates. Moreover, as Michael Polanyi has demonstrated,5 even our preference for truth as well as our efforts to discover and communicate knowledge, is at bottom a commitment to the possibility of making veridical judgments and to our capacities to know reality. Such commitments are not first established rationally and then valued; if anything it would seem that the priority is the other way around. At the very least it seems misguided, if not pernicious, to pretent that the so-called "objective" and "subjective" aspects of human experience can, let alone should, be separated. In conclusion, I wish to return briefly to Kant's suggestion that a "symbolical anthropomorphism" avoids the difficulties of traditional theistic talk of God because it "concerns language only and not the object itself (p. 106). Here again we see the pivotal dualism that has plagued Kant throughout his monumental philosophy, even in those places, such as the "Conclusion" to his Prolegomena, where he seems to be struggling against it. The faulty understanding of metaphoric and analogical expression, to say nothing of the overstated contrast between language and reality, undermines any serious effort to. propose a positive cognition at the base of natural theology. Had he not begun by assuming the necessity of such dualisms, Kant might have been able to develop further his highly suggestive insights concerning the metaphoric and analogical character of theological thought and language. Indeed, these very notions themselves provided a foothold for a fresh approach to such matters, but Kant was unable to disentangle himself from his prior commitments. NOTES 1. Cf.
