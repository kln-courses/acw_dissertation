<plain_text><page sequence="1">[ The Personalist Forum. Volume 12, number 1. Spring 1996. 11-17. ] Theology as Rhetoric_ Peter Donovan Charles Conti's book offers a rich and subtle account of Farrer's philo sophical theology in personalist terms. As such, I find it impressive and convincing, but still able, perhaps, to benefit from an outsider's blunt ques tion about what is going on here. My efforts at an answer will be brief. Like Farrer, Conti relies heavily on his skill with words and allusions, an abundant use of poetic images and literary devices, and a blending of technicality and high abstraction with conversation and wit. He also takes for granted the various hidden sources of persuasiveness and authority accompanying his celebrated subject's texts and discourse. It is important to his work not only that Farrer wrote "brilliant philosophical theology" but also that he was an Oxford don and an Anglican divine, with an exceptional personal history and an impressive scholarly output. Unlike most philosophers of religion, neither Farrer nor Conti have been in the least afraid of rhetoric. They both appreciate that theological discourse succeeds not by offering a single line of reasoning but by a multidimensional presentation, a conjuring at many levels with words and tropes. While they are well aware of the academic, analytical expectations for professional philosophizing, they know too that their subject matter (God) invites far more, and their intended audiences (thinkers about God) offer much broader communicative possibilities. To choose the rhetorical as an angle from which to review Conti's work might seem demeaning or trivializing, when there is so much more there; a wealth of thought and research lies behind almost every footnote. Yet rhetoric is regaining something of its classic standing in scholarship, and the fair-minded exploration of contexts and strategies of persuasion promises to be a growing source of understanding, particularly in cross disciplinary endeavors like this one. Rhetorical analysis reminds us that one does not theologize or philoso phize at large. One must first convince oneself with chosen lines of reason ing and patterns of thought, and then go on to carry conviction to a certain</page><page sequence="2">12 Peter Donovan intended audience, a particular market or constituency. Thus one's presen tation, not just of arguments in the strict sense, but of a persuasive strategy as a whole (sources, vocabulary, images, associations, and resonances, tone and style, things left unsaid . . . ) invites critical reflection, not to debunk, but in the interests of better appreciating and evaluating the overall achievement. Consider, for instance, the rhetorical significance of Farrer's chief con ceptual shift, as Conti presents it: the move from metaphysical "being" and "substance" talk to more personalist and voluntarist images and ways of speaking about God. Conti portrays this as a development in thought influenced by, among other things, responses to logical positivism and linguistic analysis, dissatisfaction with Neoorthodox and other alternatives, and insights provoked by process theology. Another reading of this complex process of production is to see Farrer finding personalism increasingly attractive for a variety of strategic and rhetorical reasons. After all, Farrer was a priest and preacher, a pastor deeply concerned for "our terribly weak Church" with, as Conti says, "a sense of duty to historic Christianity" (223). He was seeking to communi cate his deepest convictions during a time when traditional theology faced growing academic irrelevance. Scholasticism was history; metaphysics had become a joke; veriflcationism threatened God-talk with vacuity. A personal, activist theism, however, might still be given credible intellectual support. Even positivists retained a respect for morality; lin guistic philosophers treated "persons" as logically different and saw "action" as something special. Alongside the spreading mood of skepticism about the supernatural was (by way of compensation) a growing recogni tion for immanent spiritualities and everyday values in our world. Love, human rights, freedom, social action, ideals of personal fulfilment and flourishing were beginning to receive endorsement by popular culture, with awakening public concerns also about the modern world's dehumanizing threats. Personhood seemed like one of the few remaining mysteries of everyday life, a precious, endangered gift. Psychologists, counsellors, thera pists began to replace clergy as moral guides, focussing on relationships and the interpersonal world as a definitively human domain. In the Christian community itself, the time was ripe for a return to per sonal, humanized images. The simple narratives of Holy Scripture, after Vatican II, gained fresh familiarity among lay Catholics. "Biblical" was an 'in' word with Protestants too, if not for the Bible's historical truths, then</page><page sequence="3">Theology as Rhetoric 13 at least for its revealed images and redeeming doctrines. Everyday Christian piety and experience remained alive, with even the hope of mass spiritual revival in the air in some quarters. Now an effective appropriation of personalist thought for theological and apologetic purposes was by no means novel for British theology. For instance, a generation of scholars and pastors in the nonconformist circles Fairer had left behind looked to writers like John Oman and H. H. Farmer for accessible philosophical theologies of prayer, providence, and a God present and active in Christian experience. But for theistic personalism to be commended to the established Church, looking to its own thinkers for solid reassurance in difficult times, a philosophical endeavor customized to Oxford-style tastes and in a more rigorous mode would clearly be necessary. Farrer had the capacity, if anyone did, for the task. In college chapel and university church sermons, his portrayal of God as personal is natural and unforced, handled with tact and sincerity and, despite sharp self-ques tioning at times, always triumphant biblical and doctrinal orthodoxy. In his more popular writing, too, adopting the words and images of a personal theism enabled him to develop, with discretion and discernment (no naive literalism or "petty providentialism"), a line of approach he could confi dently make his own and offer his Christian contemporaries and the wider world of faith and doubt. When it came to philosophical theology?his reputation already established as the English Church's leading metaphysi cian?what remained to be done was to show that a more voluntarist, active, and immanent mode of conceiving of God was by no means incom patible with the best in Christian philosophizing. Now Conti speaks often of Farrer's developed position as a "personal ist metaphysics." The book's title implies the same. But does Farrer ever offer a stand-alone personalist philosophy, or a metaphysics as such? Would his intended audience have gained much from either? What I find in Farrer, so far as I can understand him, (and this is intensified in Conti's paraphrase) is not metaphysics proper or a pure personalism, but a Christian theology expressed and illuminated through the use of philosoph ically suggestive personal categories: activity, morality, will, intention, grace, incarnation. In subtle analogical ways these are taken to carry a metaphysical load, but they make their most solid contribution at the level of plausibility, familiarity, and imaginative engagement.</page><page sequence="4">14 Peter Donovan In the best sense of the word, the exercise is rhetorical through and through. Shrewd discussions offered along the way of relevant conceptual and theological issues (which Conti summarizes for us with flair and originality) serve to maintain a general scholarly tone rather than to put in place any overall conceptual edifice. The main thrust is persuasion towards what Farrer calls "working faith and rational conviction," not demonstra tion of a distinct philosophical position. He tells us, "I would rather . . . provide materials for an exercise in understanding, than formalise a chain of argument" (FS, vi). Like understanding, plausibility is enhanced by association. In a climate of high regard for humanness and personhood, the more a theology can be shown amenable to person-talk the better its chance of appearing coherent, attractive, and reasonable. Like Conti, but for rhetorical reasons as well, I agree with the Feuerbachian, anthropological bridge building he finds Farrer endorsing. If God can be spoken of in personal terms with a gain thereby in spiritual and pragmatic efficacy (to which I shall come in a moment) and without offending too many established philosophical and theological sensibilities, then it makes sound sense to do so, whether we construct a personalist metaphysic to justify it, invoke the scriptural imago dei, or just call it good old-fashioned anthropomorphism. Understood in terms of rhetoric and communicative strategy then, Farrer's and Conti's personalist theologizing is intelligible and appealing, even if the exercise at times overwhelms one with its virtuosity and erudition. There does seems to me, however, a danger in trying to make the strategy work too well; in having a full-blooded traditionalist Christian theism seem so tailor-made for personalist construal that the whole exercise could smack of special pleading and contrivance. For instance, to disparage numinous, nonspecific senses of the divine, or to overwork Christology and Incarnation (to play too much to the creedal gallery, as one might crudely put it), will seriously affect a theology's usefulness these days by leaving a lot of other devout theists on the outer. Conti thinks that so long as Christology and Incarnation are used metaphysically rather than doctrinally there is still room for interreligious dialogue (217). I am not so sure. One remaining issue intrigues me. Conti introduces his final chapter ("The 'Becoming' of Being") by promising to draw the remarks on Faith and Speculation "to an apposite Wittgensteinian conclusion" (172). He has already told us in his introduction (xx) that that work "undoubtedly had a Wittgensteinian 'feel' to it," and he makes a similar point in note 9 on</page><page sequence="5">Theology as Rhetoric 15 page 233. Yet Wittgenstein receives no further mention by name or reference in Conti's chapter 6, and of course is nowhere to be seen in Faith and Speculation. What can this mean? I agree with the view that Wittgensteinian insights can help us uncover an important development in Farrer's thought. But it requires some deep digging, in perhaps unexpected areas. The area I wish to suggest is the pragmatic underside of theology's rhetoric. Whatever else Wittgenstein has brought to our attention, one emphasis seems particularly important for understanding religion and theology; it is the indispensability of practice. Beneath the things said are the things done. Sustaining religious metaphysics, doctrines, and rhetorical language games are certain social and personal forms of life. These include, of course, explicit moral practices, and the habits of mind, maxims, and exemplars accompanying them. Generally speaking, Christians model their conduct in various ways on the life and teachings of Christ, the Gospel parables and Pauline exhortations. Their moral instincts are shaped and reinforced by customary Church teaching, and especially by the instruction given at home and school, along with the influences of friends and relatives and the wider pressures for conformity and moral improvement in a particular religious community and subculture. In addition there are, within the lives of organizations and groups, subtle and implicit influences going well beyond the level of formal moral instruction. Every family, every center of learning, every parish and congregation has its own peculiar history, its distinctive ethos, its unspoken opinions and expectations, internalized role models, private satisfactions and benefits, hushed-up scandals and treasured memories. All these and countless other nonrational and seldom intellectualized factors affect what people think, feel and do, in their religious lives, as in everything else. And as well as the moral dimensions of practice, there are the socio political relations identified by classic sociologists such as Durkheim and Weber and refined in recent scholarship by social theorists like Michel Foucault and Pierre Bourdieu. These scholars remind us of the important part religion plays in creating the structures within which people experi ence interpersonal power and manage social and familial relationships. Their distinctive contribution is to highlight how language and authority are intimately connected, how rhetoric and theory accompany and interact with cultural, political, and economic matters in everyday life.</page><page sequence="6">16 Peter Donovan Devotional acts and attitudes include particular habits of respect and submission, not only towards God and other spiritual beings, but towards certain of one's fellow beings as well. Deference for hierarchies of gender, class, or expertise is accompanied by demonstrations of privilege and responsibility, patronage and condescension, dominance and compliance, whether in institutional or in domestic roles. Piety and spirituality, even when they seem elevated and otherworldly, inevitably affect communal tastes and values, and have their impact on divisions of labor and distribu tions of wealth. It is all too easy for those of us with largely philosophical interests to conceive of theology as more rational and cerebral than it actually is, relegating to social scientists and others those aspects of it we choose not to attend to. Yet when we look at living religions themselves we see that they in fact have much less concern with philosophical insights than with pragmatic results (spiritual and material), promising salvation, liberation, enlightenment, eternal life, redemption, happiness, escape from bondage, power over enemies, and so on. They provide ways, paths, methods, lessons, cures, disciplines. To ask "Do they work?" is not to cheapen them, but to take them on their own terms. Religious practice, then, in its broadest sense, helps construct complex social and experiential worlds without which the more theoretical dis courses of doctrine, theology, and metaphysics lack vital roots of meaning and relevance. It is matters like these which a "Wittgensteinian approach" invites us to take more seriously. There is much in Farrer's work that shows he shares this fundamentally pragmatic perspective. Despite the fact that he maintains an ongoing dialogue (sometimes rigorous, sometimes in formal) with philosophy on behalf of the believer, and that he claims to speak "philosophically, not dogmatically," his underlying confidence about the subject clearly arises from active involvement in a living tradition. To sustain plausibility, in other words, a theological rhetoric in person alist terms requires engagement with a practising constituency, a communi ty of persons immersed in a particular way of living, the social structures and dynamics of which are intimately connected with their beliefs, their habits and their words. Farrer presupposes this, speaking of the "life-in faith" of the believer in the midst of an ongoing community of experience and discipline, the church. However much he may have attempted to com municate a message in general, academic terms Farrer was a churchman, and even his metaphysics and his philosophical theology are, in a sense,</page><page sequence="7">Theology as Rhetoric 17 accompaniments of his sermons to Christian faithful and would-be believers. Just how Charles Conti would specify the life-world and sphere of practice that undergirds his discourse is by no means so clear. His interpre tation of Farrer's message as a personalist philosophy appears to envisage a more diffuse constituency. The instances of personal practice he invokes tend to be existential, private acts and volitions, within the realm of secular self-understanding rather than the domains of liturgy, service, and institu tional loyalty. To whom in particular is his exposition addressed? Whatever the answer to that (and I hope Charles will offer one in reply) I am pleased to record my gratitude at having been an observer, at points along the way, of a sustained scholarly exercise which displays great faithfulness to its subject matter, and creativity and discernment in analysis and interpretation.</page></plain_text>
