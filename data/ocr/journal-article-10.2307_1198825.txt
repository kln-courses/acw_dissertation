"To a greater degree than we real- ize, ordinary social change is a matter of moral revolution rather than of social organization." This moral revolution can come through the wor- ship of God as revealed in Christ. This moral revolution and this worship are never to be separated from understanding of the actual social situation in which we are living and the fruit of it is "social action" applied to the problems of justice, to relations between city and country, between farmers, traders, professional groups, and labor. (It is one of the au- thor's chief merits that he sees the problem of the farmer as vividly as that of the industrial worker.) The church has a central role in this proc- ess because it brings to men the constants by which they get their bearings and it trains them to worship the God who demands social righteousness. The social effectiveness of the church depends upon the depth of its reli- gious life. Dr. Holt has no illusions about the record of the church, but after describing the alliance between the clergy and the supporters of reaction in several periods of American history he still can say: "The fact remains that the stream of life which flows through the church from the foot of the cross is the purest stream that flows through history." One of Dr. Holt's friends has said that he is both a prophet and a social engineer. This is a book of prophecy rather than of engineering, but the wisdom of the book comes from the combination of those two functions in one person. JOHN C. BENNETT Pacific School of Religion Man the Measure. By ARTHUR HAZARD DAKIN. Princeton: Princeton University Press, I939. xiii+284 pages. $3.00. This is an essay on humanism as religion. As the Preface states, it is concerned with humanism in relation to belief in God and therefore presents a somewhat arbitrary account of only one side. The Manifesto, published in I933, outlines the general standpoint and main contentions of humanism. Thirty men signed it, including many Unitarian ministers, and a few prominent philosophers like Edwin A. Burtt, Roy Wood Sellars, and John Dewey. The author, who had his training at Princeton, char- acterizes the advocates of humanism and its objectives as "typical of middle-class, Anglo-Saxon, rationalistic liberals." He recognizes diversity among them, and finds it more difficult in the case of some than of others to keep sharply defined the contrast with theism. Perhaps it would have been better if he had discussed the opposition between his own super- I89</page><page sequence="2">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION naturalism and naturalism. He recognizes that theism has been given many forms from the low, anthropomorphic, more primitive types to those of thoughtful, modern theologians. For example, he says: "The the- ism characteristic of our age is not that of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries .... To attack that scholasticism under the impression that one is annihilating the Christianity of today has its rewards, like other forms of shadow boxing." His own kind of theism seems to be that of the mystic Baron von Higel and Clement C. J. Webb. The book is dedicated to the latter. In a chapter on humanism and scientific method, Julian Huxley, Bertrand Russell, and Roy Wood Sellars are shown to be inconsistent in their claims for scientific method. They emphasize the importance of sci- ence, and the author holds that the higher religions also employ self- criticism and a desire for truth as "untrammelled and exacting as that of any science." Science seeks to deal with facts but in doing so fails to recognize such a background as theism affirms; the author therefore re- gards the world which science presents as subjective and unable to justify an underlying order sufficient to avoid chaos and often consequent pes- simism. The fact that humanism, adhering to science, can find unity only in the organizing power of the human mind makes anything like a real universe illusory. The treatment of values-truth, beauty, and any ideal of perfection-leaves them outside scientific explanation or validation. The subject of humanism and psychology is dealt with chiefly in terms of the psychology of Freud and Jung, and therefore the idea of God is made to appear in humanism as a subjective illusion. Many of those listed as humanists, however, would scarcely regard Freudianism as the only psychology. They would not agree that "projection, suggestion, and wish-fulfillment" are the main principles of psychology. Thus John Dewey, for example, holds a definite conception of God, but in other than supernatural terms. In ethics, humanists hold to the supremacy of human personality, but they hold to it as valuable in its own right, without requiring theistic guaranties. For theism morality is insufficient in its own right and unable to call forth the necessary loyalty. Humanists regard ethical values as self-evidencing but do not hold that on this account there is no important place for religion. They believe that religion weakens its case by seeking supernatural guaranties for the virtues which experience justifies. One is sometimes surprised by concessions which the author makes on points for which humanists contend. An example of this occurs in the dis- cussion of the conception of the personality of God. Professor Julian S. Huxley is taken to task because he ascribes to Christianity a highly I9go</page><page sequence="3">CRITICAL REVIEWS anthropomorphic conception of God. The author contends that the con- ception of personality as applied to God does not belong to the "classical theology of Christendom" and that the phrase is unknown to Christian theology until well within the last two hundred years. On the whole this book gives the impression that humanism is too diverse and inconsistent within the writings of those included under the name of "humanist" to allow a clear and decisive refutation of it. The difficulty of refuting it is increased by the fact that the representatives of theism cited are not in agreement among themselves. The two terms- humanism and theism-really represent two general movements of thought: the former concerned with the development of modern science in the interest of human welfare and the latter with the defense of tradi- tional theological concepts. They thus move on quite different levels. EDWARD SCRIBNER AMES University of Chicago Our Knowledge of God. By JOHN BAILLIE. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, I939. ix+263 pages. $2.50. Besides being a significant contribution to the discussion of a peren- nially important theme, this is a delightful book, beautifully argued and beautifully written, and it will not have fulfilled its true vocation unless many besides the technical theologians read it. The basic thesis of the book is that our knowledge of God is not in- ferential, derived as a conclusion from a surer knowledge of the things of sense, but is direct and immediate. God is "of all realities that by which we are most directly and intimately confronted." His existence is there- fore not to be established by "proofs." Such proofs are really rationaliza- tions of a knowledge already possessed, and the traditional arguments have the value only of enabling us better to understand the God whose existence we either cannot doubt or cannot argue ourselves into believing. Baillie thus stands nearer to Anselm and Bonaventura than to Thomas. But this direct knowledge of God is not a prior knowledge in the sense of being something innate and independent of experience. Rather, God con- fronts us inescapably "in, with, and under" all of our experiences. Knowl- edge of him is thus not an inference from other knowledge but is part and parcel of all knowledge. We could not know ourselves, other minds, na- ture, or God, Baillie suggests, if we did not know all four together. He reviews recent researches into the problem of our knowledge of other minds to demonstrate that our knowledge of God, like our knowl- edge of others, is not knowledge of an object but of another subject; and I9I</page></plain_text>
