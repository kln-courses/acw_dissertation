Albany: State University of New York Press,  2009.  183 pp.  $35.00. This book is fascinating. For those of us for whom the study of Maimonides  has been rooted in history of thought or in systematic philosophy and theolo- gy, this book provides a psychotherapeutic and psychoanalytic reading of Mai- monides. And, for those of us for whom the study of Freud has been rooted  in history of psychoanalysis, this book provides an insight into an important  source for some of Freud’s most radical ideas. It is Merkur’s continuation of  the work of Bakan, who died before its completion. The choice of Maimonides was a good one for several reasons. First, Mai- monides’ The Eight Chapters, his work on psychology, and his The Guide for the  Perplexed existed in translations in Freud’s time. Second, Maimonides was a  “cultural hero” for assimilating Jews in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries  who read Maimonides as a “scientist” and “rationalist,” creating for themselves  a kind of “Jewish Kant.” Third, as a modern “cultural hero,” Maimonides was  almost surely the subject of lectures and conferences at the Vienna lodge of  B’nai Brith that Freud attended regularly and in which he also gave lectures.  Finally, as Merkur shows, Freud, while not himself observant or even religious  in a theological sense, came from an educated Jewish family in which the works  of Maimonides would likely have been available.  Chapter One argues that Maimonides saw his chief task as a healer of  body and soul. His therapy is composed of two parts: first, practice the op- posite virtue or vice until one has reached the golden mean of balanced behav- ior, and second, believe that sin can be corrected. Teshuva (repentance), in its  intellectual as well as its actional dimensions, is, thus, Maimonides’ cognitive- behavioral therapy.  Chapter Two presents Maimonides’ “intellectualist mysticism,” which is  “an ‘aha’ experience of creative inspiration . . . when someone ‘gets’ an idea . . .  when ‘the penny drops.’” Then, “through engaging in a certain specified intra- Shofar  ♦  An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies </page> <page sequence="2">   Book Reviews ♦ 155 psychic process,” it is possible to create “the possibility of radical reform of  the condition of human experience.” Merkur identifies this process as “medita- tion” (hitbonenut). It is accomplished by careful reasoning and is followed by  “practicing the presence of God,” i.e., “a cognitively rich and varied process of  inspiration that he [Maimonides] identified with biblical prophecy . . . engag- ing God in a prophetic dialogue.” Bakan and Merkur call the whole “rational  mysticism.”  As I read Maimonides in his twelfth-century context, I find that he teach- es that there is a “post-philosophic” experience of “being in the presence of  God.” Bakan and Merkur, however, dispute my claim and propose that there  is nothing “post”-philosophic at all. Rather, that “the bliss is never postrational  or nonrational . . . indicate[s] that a cognitively limited or seemingly empty  experience was emphatically not the content of Maimonides’ contemplative  experience.” I think Bakan and Merkur, by denying the extramental existence  of the Intelligences and the intellect, a belief that was common in medieval  Jewish and Muslim philosophical theology, have distorted Maimonides and,  therefore, also his understanding of the ultimate religious experience. How- ever, others scholars share Bakan and Merkur’s reading of Maimonides, and  they may be right. Nonetheless, I suspect that the denial of the postrational is  a projection of modern sensibilities and conceptualities.  Chapter Three argues that, for Maimonides, imagination is central to  prophecy, but imagination is also the source of sin in that it allows humans  to imagine that evil is good. Thus, imagining a bad act to be good induces one  to actional sin, and imagining God to be anthropomorphic induces one to  theological sin. Maimonides handled theological sin by making all prophecy  (except that of Moses) a metaphor, i.e., a dream or a vision. Freud must have  been fascinated by this “book on dreams and visions” in which the images of  the imagination can cause illness / sin. Chapter Four argues that Maimonides openly admits that sacred texts, as  well as his own text, use exoteric-esoteric methods of teaching; the interpreta- tion is always the true meaning, never the surface imagery.  Chapter Five argues that there were three categories of secret teaching in  rabbinic Judaism: matters pertaining to sexuality, the creation story, and the  interpretation of the vision of Ezekiel. Merkur does not deal with the first  except to suggest that its inclusion among the secrets of the law might sug- gest that the other two also had sexual content. As to creation, Merkur reads  Maimonides’ dichotomies of heaven and earth and Adam and Eve as referring  to form and matter respectively, with form being active and matter being re- ceptive.

The use of sexual imagery to expound the doc- trine of creation is Maimonides’ secret teaching. Freud would have been struck  powerfully by this.  The vision in the first chapter of Ezekiel known as “the account of the  chariot” was the most secret of all teachings. Maimonides, strictly following  the rabbinic prescriptions, does not expound this directly but gives only hints  and contradictory statements. Merkur interprets the image that is the center  of Ezekiel’s vision as the key metaphor for God, noting that it is fire from the  waist down and hashmal from the waist up. Ezekiel’s description of God in his  vision is, thus, another of Maimonides’ “paired ideas” and hence, as Merkur  sees it, contains a sexual teaching. Maimonides reads hashmal (a color in the  original) in its rabbinic sense of “rapid” and “cutting” (actually, “circumcising”).  This, Merkur takes to indicate that the figure is “engaged in coitus, sawing back  and forth in his seat,” a sexual metaphor for God. Freud would have been  struck powerfully by this, too. I doubt Maimonides had this in mind, though it is not impossible if the  true “secret” here is the permissibility and pervasiveness of sexual imagery— only as a metaphor, not as a theological assertion about creation and certainly  not about God. Given Bakan and Merkur’s Freudian reading of Maimonides’  reading of Ezekiel’s vision, I wonder how they missed the obviously homoerotic  dimension of the imagery. This would fit well with the pervasive sexuality of the  “secret” but also with the rigorously androcentric view of reality that is the core  of rational thinking. Such a reading was not unknown in later kabbala.  Chapter Six reviews very concisely the therapeutic method of Mai- monides. Here, Merkur admits that Maimonides’ cognitive-behavioral thera- py is only supportive; it does not provide “resolution of mental conflict, leading  to increased psychic integration.”  Chapter Seven lists convergences between Maimonides and Freud: (1)  Both believed that imagination projects imagery on the concept of God. (2)  Both admitted that the primary impulse for knowledge was preconscious, and  that it was imagination and thought that gave form to that primary impulse /  emanation. (3) Both admitted the reality of fantasy / imagination that creates  a true reality of it own. Further, both admitted that the reification of this imag- ination was the source of error. (4) Both understood that dreams (and visions)  were the result of mental and imaginative work; that dreams had exoteric and  esoteric levels of meaning; and that dreams used various techniques to conceal  their inner meaning. (5) Both privileged the hidden levels of dreams and es- pecially the place of sexual imagery. This is the fundamental “secret” teaching.  Shofar  ♦  An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies </page> <page sequence="4">  Book Reviews ♦ 157 (6) Both believed that “resistance” (the inability to recognize the wrongness  of one’s deeds or thoughts because of denial and repression) was the cause of  wrong / sinful behavior, and brought therapy to a halt. For both, inappropri- ate thoughts, desires, and deeds need to be admitted as part of therapy. (7)  Both recognized that behavior and belief could become compulsive / that God  punished sinners by cutting them off from Him, i.e., by hardening their hearts.  Hence, freeing / recovering one’s will through critical autobiographical work— and, for Maimonides, through behavioral change—was crucial to therapy. (8)  Both understood that religion rests on science and provides a framework for  social-religious teaching of proper behavior; further, that Judaism was a de- velopment out of more primitive religions. (9) Both shared an androcentric  view of the world. Finally (10), both were preoccupied with Moses and saw  themselves as teachers of a definitive saving truth. A great chapter that shows  two great minds at work, the one likely an influence on the other.  So much has been written on Maimonides and so much has been written  on Freud. This book is a definite contribution to that effort. David R.

Brighton, MA:  Academic Studies Press, 2009.  442 pp.  $49.00. This book addresses the contentious issue: what was Freud’s attitude to re- ligion, and by extension, to Judaism? On one hand Freud’s biographer, Peter  Gay, insisted that Freud was a “Godless Jew,” and that Judaism played no role  in the creation of psychoanalysis. On the other hand, Bruno Bettelheim has  pointed out that such conclusions emerge from the systematic mistranslations  of Freud’s works, particularly by James Strachey. He emphasized the rational  over the irrational, or as I would prefer to say, the non-rational elements in his  writings, in order to make Freud more acceptable to an American audience.  Freud was a wordsmith, perhaps as great as Goethe. When Freud chose to use  “psyche,” he specifically meant soul, not mind. Hence psycho-analysis is best  rendered “soul analysis,” not mind or mental analysis, a change which totally  recalibrates one’s thinking about Freud’s intentions. Freud did disparage God and religion, as Celia Brickman points out in  her excellent initial chapter on “Psychoanalysis and Judaism in Context.” But  his attitude was rather more complex than most readers realize. Like Torah  niglah and Torah nistar, the revealed and hidden observance of scripture, Freud  appeared to despise formal practices and simplistic views of God.
