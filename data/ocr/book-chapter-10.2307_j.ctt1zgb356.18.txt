Brady,  Fiona Petchey, Jerome Mialanes, Emilie Chalmin, Jean-Michel  Geneste, Ian Moffat, Ken Aplin and Margaret Katherine Introduction Western Arnhem Land in northern Australia has the rare distinction, both at national and global  scales, of containing a vast landscape of many thousands of rockshelters richly decorated with  art, some of which was probably made tens of thousands of years ago, others as recently as  a few decades ago. Yet the challenge remains as to how to date this art, how to find out how  old it is. While relative dating methods have been commonly applied, in particular patterns  of superimposition and changing faunal themes supposedly signalling changing environmental  conditions, we still lack a clear understanding of the age of almost all the region’s art styles  or conventions. Other chapters in this volume report direct dates for Arnhem Land art using radiocarbon  determinations on beeswax figures with the likelihood that the ‘art event’, the time when  a beeswax figure was made, is at most a few years different from the ‘carbon event’, the time of the  last biological capture of atmospheric carbon, which is the actual date measured by radiocarbon.  But many, in fact most, sites have no beeswax figures or other ways directly to date the art.  Sometimes, as again reported in this volume, there is some indication of date when a radiocarbon  determination is obtained on, for instance, charcoal in an archaeological deposit that can be  related to the art. Often that route is also blocked: many a painted surface without beeswax  figures is in no close relation to a deposit that might so be dated. What can be done then? Here we present results of investigations at a small rockshelter in Jawoyn Country, in the central- western part of the Arnhem Land plateau. Since its art cannot be directly dated, we follow a  different path. In the first instance, we aim to understand the history, and antiquity, of the  decorated rock surfaces, since the exposed surfaces of the boulder have undergone repeated  transformations over a long time. Determining when now-decorated rock surfaces were formed  can give us maximum possible ages for the art, since we can date when the surface first was  available. Taken with related archaeological evidence from deposits, such as ochre fragments with  signs of use, we can arrive at some indications for the age of the art, or at least how the range of  possible dates is constrained. This approach is akin to that used at other sites in Jawoyn Country  (see Chapters 11 and 15) </page> <page sequence="2"> 372    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia Site JSARN–0113/23 The small, shallow rockshelter site JSARN–113/23 in the Jawoyn Association’s GIS database  is on the southeastern side of a massive quartzite stack of the Kombolgie Formation that also  contains site JSARN–113/19 on its opposite side (Figures 14.1–14.3). This boulder stack is  located 150 m south of JSARN–124 site 3, which is studied in Chapter 15 (see Gunn et al. 2011  for details; Figure 1.1). All these sites are on Buyhmi clan lands in Jawoyn Aboriginal Country  (see Gunn et al. 2011 for the site’s environment).  The boulder stack sheltering JSARN–113/23 is a sub-horizontally bedded tilted block, individual  rock strata dipping slightly southward. The shelter is 5 m wide across the dripline, 3 m deep  from dripline to back wall, has an 87° mean aspect (i.e. it faces east) and is well-shaded in the  afternoon, with sunlight illuminating the floor and part of the wall in the morning. The back  wall appears to be well protected from rainfall. The floor is flat and sandy. The northern end  is bounded by massive rockfall that rises steeply above ground, demarcating the edge of the  site. Across the shelter, the floor level is flush with the surrounding plain. Spinifex (Triodia sp.)  hummocks and small Eucalyptus trees grow from the dripline onto the plain.  Square A was excavated under a low, convex, steep and slightly protruding rock overhang. Here,  two superimposed rows of red stick-figure anthropomorphs (from here on, ‘stick-figures’) occur  over red-and-yellow bichrome anthropomorphs on a fresh rock surface.

Our aim was to recover fragments of rock that had detached from  the wall prior to the paintings being made, creating the wall surface in the process and giving  a maximum age for the art on it.  Square A began as a 50 × 50 cm square, reduced to 50 × 40 cm below 2.4 cm depth, to avoid a small  termite runway at the western edge of the pit. Square A was excavated in mean 1.8 ± 0.6 cm  thick arbitrary Excavation Units (XUs) following the stratigraphy (Table 14.1). Excavation went  down 39 XUs to a maximum depth of 71.1 cm. In 2012, Square B, 75 × 75 cm in area, was added against the eastern wall of Square A. It was  reduced to an area 75 × 50 cm when overhanging rocks were reached in XU14 (i.e. below  26 cm depth). Square B was excavated in 2.2 ± 0.6 cm thick XUs following the stratigraphy  (Table 14.2); excavation progressed for 19 XUs to a maximum depth of 41 cm (Figures 14.3  and 14.4).

Stone artefacts ≥2 cm long  were individually plotted and bagged. Bulk  sediment samples were collected from each  XU of each square. The walls of the excavated  squares were photographed and sections were  drawn (e.g. Figures 14.5–14.7). The base of cultural sediments was not  reached in either square; difficulty of access to  this remote site, reached only by helicopter,  has meant deferment of completion of the  excavation.

SU1 is the loose  surface layer, the present treadage zone. It consists of light brownish-gray (dry Munsell: 10YR 6/2)  aeolian sand with minor leaf litter and charcoal. Its boundary with underlying SU2 is horizontal,  flat and c. 1 cm thick. SU2 consists of slightly consolidated and slightly compact grayish- brown (10YR 5/2) ashy, aeolian sand with abundant charcoal and few rootlets. The interface  with underlying SU3 is diffuse, c. 7 cm thick. SU3 is fairly compact and slightly consolidated  yellowish-brown (10YR 5/6 to 10YR 5/8) aeolian sand; charcoal decreases with depth and is  always more sparse than in SU2.  Within each SU, sediments are homogeneous except in SU3, where many small (typically  10  cm  long and 0.5–2.5 cm thick) tabular quartzite fragments from the overlying rock wall  lie flat or slightly slanted across a well-defined horizon at 35–45 cm depth in Square A (see the  west stratigraphic section of Square A, Figure 14.6). At the base of SU3, quartzite rocks with  flat surfaces and typically &gt;30 cm long occur in a sandy matrix; they lie either flat or slanted.  Here, excavation ceased without reaching the base of cultural deposits. The level where the  buried rocks were first encountered is deeper in Square A than in Square B, indicating that over  c. 1 m from the back wall towards the dripline, under the overhang with the red and yellow  bichrome anthropomorphs and the stick-figures, relatively little rockfall has occurred (see south  stratigraphic section, Figure 14.5). It is within this sandy SU3 layer that we have found evidence  for the age of the red and yellow bichrome anthropomorphs and stick-figures (see below). Ground penetrating radar Two ground penetrating radar (GPR) profiles were made in 2012, to understand better the  site’s stratigraphy, depth to bedrock and underground presence of isolated pieces of roof-fall.  While GPR is rarely used in this way, it has obvious application in stratigraphic (Neal 2004) and  rockshelter investigations (Conyers 2012:66–68). One transect line ran approximately west–east  (from back wall to beyond the dripline) a short distance north of Square A, along the northern  side of the subsequently excavated Square B. A second line ran approximately north–south  (parallel to the back wall) through Square B, a short distance east of Square A. The GPR data  were obtained using a Mala X3M unit with a 250 Mhz antenna using a sampling frequency of  5791 Mhz, time window of 83 ns, trace interval of 0.02 m, 480 sample and four stacks. The data  were processed and interpreted using ReflexW software using a suite of filters including subtract  mean (dewow), bandpass, running average, energy decay, move start time, Fk migration and  time cut (see Goodman and Piro 2013). Hyperbola modelling was used to define the velocity  of electromagnetic energy through sediment as 0.13 m/ns for the site. The results were initially  interpreted after completion of the excavation without reference to the stratigraphic plans or  photographs of Square B, to test the efficacy of GPR to locate subsurface features.  The interpreted results (see Figure 14.8) suggest a maximum depth of ‘soft’ sediments c. 1 m  below ground, but these ‘soft’ sediments are universally armoured from the surface downwards  by the presence of large pieces of rock. Several large blocks of rock surrounded by areas of ‘soft’  sediment containing small rocks are evident in the GPR plots. The three largest pieces of roof-fall  subsequently exposed by excavation (see Figures 14.9 and 14.10) are clearly evident in the GPR  results (Figure 14.8).  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="9"> 14.

Despite these positive results, improvements to field methods may further enhance the potential  of GPR at this and other similar sites. Here, the deep penetration of the GPR, over more than  4.0 m depth before the use of time cut, indicates that a higher frequency unit in the range of  500–1000 Mhz would provide significantly higher vertical and horizontal resolution (Rial et al.  2009); this would facilitate the accurate detection and determination of the detailed geometry  of sub-surface rocks. The depth of medium-sized rocks, as shown in Figures 14.8–14.10, is  significantly underestimated by the GPR conditions used, although the broad geometries of  the blocks are adequately represented. Small blocks of rock located close to larger rocks cannot  generally be distinguished as separate items; however, this could be remedied with a higher- frequency antenna.  Radiocarbon dating Twenty-five accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dates were obtained: 15 from  Square A, nine from Square B and one from a beeswax pellet applied to the wall near the stick- figures (Table 14.3).

Calibrations undertaken using  OxCal 4.2 (IntCal13) (Reimer et al. 2013). Source: Authors’ data. All dates have been calibrated with OxCal v4.2.2 (Bronk Ramsey 2013) and subsequently  evaluated using sequence analysis, with each phase of burning (as represented by the radiocarbon  dates) separated by a uniform boundary (Bronk Ramsey 2009). All 24 dates from the excavation  are in good chrono-stratigraphic order (Table 14.3; Figures 14.5 and 14.6). For the sequence  analysis, six Burning Phases are identified. From oldest (deepest) to youngest, they are: • Burning Phase 1: 28,740 to 26,160 cal BP (followed by a c. 10,000-year-long hiatus). • Burning Phase 2: 15,570 to 11,530 cal BP (followed by a 2000-year-long hiatus, in SU3). • Burning Phase 3: 9540 to 9260 cal BP (followed by a c. 700-year-long hiatus). • Burning Phase 4: 8510 to 3670 cal BP (followed by a c. 1500-year-long hiatus, in SU3). • Burning Phase 5: 2370 to 1650 cal BP (followed by a c. 1000-year-long hiatus, between the  top of SU3 and base of SU2). • Burning Phase 6: 520 to –30 cal BP. Burning between Burning Phases 3 and 4 (9540–3670 cal BP) appears to have been near- continuous. Within SU3, in Square B the layer of large rocks ends 12,750–12,160 cal BP  (Wk-34170 and Wk-34171). These radiocarbon determinations have been grouped, along with  dates from Square A, into Burning Phase 2 dated from 15,570 to 11,530 cal BP. In Square A,  adjacent to the back wall, large rocks occur in an earlier phase of rockfall dated earlier than  26,680–26,190 cal BP. The major period of rockfall thus ends with the onset of the Holocene in  Square B, and does not seem to have affected the area against the back wall. The horizon in SU3 containing the thin tabular quartzite pieces at 35–45 cm depth in Square A  dates to after 9540 cal BP, but before a phase of more rapid sediment build-up beginning 3670  cal BP (see Figure 14.6). These small tabular pieces of rock were first encountered in XU26 and  continue upwards to XU15, with peak numbers in XU25. In XU21, they include small, thin  pieces of rock cortex. Exactly when between c. 9540 cal BP (boundary between Burning Phases 3  and 2) and c. 3670 cal BP (boundary between Burning Phases 4 and 5) these tabular pieces began  to fall is uncertain, as the deepest ones come from sediments deposited when sedimentation was  slow. The sand in which these tabular pieces are now buried would have been loose at the time  of deposition. However, that these tabular pieces lay flat when excavated, or slightly slanted  where they were lying against small rocks, and that in XU25 many conjoining pieces lay next to  each other in correct alignment and orientation indicates that post-depositional movement was  minimal. The implication is that these tabular pieces were laid down close to 9540 cal BP, when  the level of the shelter floor was at XU25.  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="13"> 14.

While charcoal is abundant, no hearths or hearth stones were evident; much  of the charcoal may be from landscape fires (anthropic or natural). Small fragments of disused  termite runway in SU1, SU2 and the upper level of SU3 suggests minor bioturbation down to  the SU2–SU3 interface, corresponding with Burning Phase 6 (330–520 cal BP to present).

Charcoal occurs in each XU. In Square A, their raw weights give a bimodal distribution, with  peaks in XU1–XU9 in SU1 and SU2 (Burning Phase 6: 330–520 cal BP to present), and  XU14–XU21 in the upper half of SU3 (Burning Phase 4: 7850–8510 to 3670–4400 cal BP)  (Figure 14.11). However, each XU lasts a different length of time and covers a different area of  the square (because of intruding rocks). For each Burning Phase, we have therefore calculated  how much charcoal there is by standardised area and length of time: the mid-point of the start,  and end, year range was used to calculate the length of time represented by each Burning Phase  (Figure 14.12). For example, Burning Phase 4 begins between 7850 and 8510 cal BP and ends  between 3670 and 4400 cal BP, giving estimated start and end mid-ages of 8180 cal BP and 4035  cal BP, and thus a total duration of 4145 years.  These results again indicate a clear bimodal trend in Square A, with Burning Phase 6 having  nine times as much charcoal as the preceding Burning Phase 4 (Burning Phase 5 is absent in  Square A), and Burning Phase 3 having 139 times as much charcoal as the preceding Burning  Phase 2 and nine times as much as the subsequent Burning Phase 4 (Figure 14.12). The reason  why the peak distributions evident in the raw weights by XU (Figure 14.11) relate to Burning  Phases 6 and 4, whereas they relate to Burning Phases 6 and 3 when calculated by the sum of  XUs for each Burning Phase, is that Burning Phase 3 lasted a short time (90 years), giving high  deposition rates for this period of time. These results indicate peak charcoal deposition during a  short period of heightened burning activity between 9340–9540 cal BP and 9260–9440 cal BP  (Burning Phase 3), and again between 330–520 cal BP and present (Burning Phase 6).  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="15"> 14.

Here again, Burning  Phase 6 (represented by XU1–XU9) shows a  peak in charcoal both in amounts of charcoal  by XU and by Burning Phase. This suggests  that during Burning Phase 6, fires spanned  the areas of both Squares A and B; they  reached from close to the dripline to the  back wall. However, in Square B this period  from 330–520 cal BP to present is preceded  by Burning Phase 5 (1970–2370 cal BP to  1650–2040 cal BP), which has a third the  charcoal of Burning Phase 6 but 12 times that  of the preceding Burning Phase 4. Burning  Phase  3 is not evident in Square B, as there  are no radiocarbon dates between 9340–9540  cal BP and 9260–9440 cal BP, whereas earlier  and later ages do appear at that required depth  (41–48 cm in Square A). This suggests that  the fire(s) that caused peak charcoal densities  during Burning Phase 3 in Square A was close  to the frieze with the stick-figures (see below).  Excavated cultural materials:  Faunal remains No faunal remains were recovered, despite  the use of relatively fine-grained retrieval  methods. This is unsurprising for the sandy  and moderately acidic (pH mostly &lt;5;  Table  14.1) older levels whose sediments are  clearly not conducive to the long-term survival  Figure 14.12 Squares A and B.

Other Arnhem Land sites of essentially  similar geomorphic nature, including site  JSARN–113/19 that occurs under the same  boulder stack as JSARN–113/23 and, a few  kilometres away, Nawarla Gabarnmang,  have produced faunal assemblages in quite  good states of preservation dating to the past  c. 500 years (for other Arnhem Land sites, see  e.g. Foley 1985; Schrire 1982; White 1971;  Wright et al. 2013).  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="17"> 14.  Determining the age of paintings at JSARN–113/23, Jawoyn Country    387  Given these observations, we suspect that the complete absence of degraded macroscopic  fragments of bone, molluscan shell and even invertebrate exoskeleton in the upper levels of  JSARN–113/23 is a primary feature of the deposit, presumably reflecting an absence of any ‘on  site’ domestic or ritual activity that involved animal remains. Alternatively, this absence of faunal  remains might reflect the operation of an especially aggressive destructive environment that is  not commonly encountered. One possible candidate is termite activity, as termites have been  observed to rapidly destroy unburnt bone that becomes invested in runways (Aplin, unpublished  observation). However, this explanation seems unlikely to explain the absence of burnt or  calcined bone, which is an improbable target for termites. The total absence of faunal remains  in the upper levels of JSARN–113/23 thus suggests that the site was not used for meat-food  production, consumption and discard during the late Holocene; the acidic nature of sediments  does not allow us to make a call for earlier levels. Excavated cultural materials: Grindstones All three excavated grindstones came from a comparable depth in Square B: two were retrieved  during excavation; the third was extracted from the north wall after the completion of excavation: • XU16, base at 32 cm depth (Figure 14.13A). Fragment of orange quartzite lower grindstone  measuring 80 × 66 × 59 mm and weighing 427.0 g. It was intentionally broken, as indicated  by impact marks. Its edges are naturally rounded. We estimate that the fragment represents  one quarter of the original grindstone. The abraded surface is smooth, flat and slightly convex  along its edges. The degree of abrasive wear indicates extensive use. In cross-section, the  abraded surface is reddish grey and c. 2 mm thick. This colouring is clearly visible in the  sectioned edges, and may represent natural, iron-rich components within the rock, perhaps  enhanced by thermal alteration or mineral staining through ochre grinding. • XU19 in situ item #2, base at 41 cm depth (Figure 14.13B). Fragment of a small, yellowish- orange quartzite block with two abraded surfaces. It measures 67 × 71 × 24 mm and weighs  207.8 g. The grindstone originated from a rock with naturally rounded edges. The lateral  surface (A) is uniformly smooth, finely abraded and slightly convex; it also displays older  pitting marks. The other abraded surface (B) is more irregular, grainy and convex, suggesting  that it was used as the distal end of a top-stone. Its plano-convex surface is at the widest  margin of the original block, before it split along a natural bedding plane, probably through  use. The margins of the block were worked, hence the pitting marks, to shape it prior to use  as a top-stone. • North wall, base at 28 cm depth (Figure 14.13C). Whole lower grindstone originating from  a slab of pale yellow quartzite with smooth, blunt edges fractured down the sides. It measures  130 × 115 × 36 mm and weighs 755.7 g. The abraded surface is slightly concave from  grinding, smooth, uniform, finely abraded and occupies one whole face of the artefact. Old  pecking marks are visible. The opposite side is a split surface showing clear, invasive removals  from the edges. terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="18"> 388    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia Figure 14.13 Square B: Excavated grindstones.

The lesser number of artefacts in Square A  is probably related to the low headroom near the back wall; Square B is in a more open space.  The types of raw materials discarded, and the timing of flaking events, are also different in the  two squares (Figures 14.14 and 14.15). Square A saw a major peak in stone artefact discard  during Burning Phase 3, when rates are 16 times those of Burning Phase 2 and 14 times those of  Burning Phase 4. In Square B, the pattern is different, with peak discard rates occurring during  Burning Phase 6 (Figure 14.16).

Most are made on  locally available coarse-grained quartzite  (77.3  per  cent of the Square A assemblage;  73.1 per cent of Square B). Although coarse- grained quartzite varies widely in colour, very  pale orange (10YR 8/2) and pale yellowish- orange (10YR 8/6) predominate.

In Square A, Burning Phase 3 mainly  contains coarse-grained and, to a lesser extent,  fine-grained quartzite. These raw materials  also account for the peak deposition rates of  Burning Phase 6 in Square B. Variations in the  incidence of coarse- and fine-grained quartzites  occur in tandem, suggesting a common source  (see below). terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="21"> 14.

Most are broken, followed by  complete flakes and flaked pieces (Tables 14.7 and 14.8). The total absence of coarse-grained cores  suggests manufacturing from the wall. In Square A, complete coarse-grained flakes are on average  much heavier than those on fine-grained quartzite, while in Square B, coarse-grained quartzite  flakes are slightly lighter than those made on fine-grained quartzite (Tables 14.9 and 14.10).  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="22"> 392    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia Table 14.7 Square A: Flaked stone artefacts by fracture type.

In Square A, flaked stone artefacts are on average larger during Burning Phase 3 than at any  other time (Table 14.9); the greatest volume of flaked coarse-grained quartzite also occurs then  (Figure 14.19).  Figure 14.19 Squares A and B: Volume of coarse-grained quartzite artefacts by depth. Source: Illustrations by Jerome Mialanes. Square A is close to the back wall. Here, during Burning Phase 3, coarse-grained quartzite artefacts  were made from a large block that detached from the wall during an intensive knapping phase  (see below). As peak artefact densities are only evident in Square A at this time (Figures 14.14 and  14.15), knapping activity appears to have been restricted to the back wall. In contrast, Square B’s  coarse-grained quartzite assemblage consists of smaller complete flakes; with 82.1 per cent being  &lt;10 mm long, they suggest later stages of reduction of selected flakes (Tables 14.9 and 14.10). The absence of fine-grained quartzite cores suggests they were discarded elsewhere, or that  flakes were manufactured directly from local on-wall strata. In Square A, fine-grained quartzite  complete flakes average 13.4 mm in length, of which 58.3 per cent are less than 10 mm long.  In Square B, they average 7.3 mm in length, nearly half the size, with 78.6 per cent being less  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="24"> 394    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia than 10 mm long. This pattern suggests that later stages of reduction preferentially took place in  Square B where headroom is greater than in Square A. The same pattern applies to the coarse- grained quartzite, with smaller complete flakes in Square B than in Square A. Retouched quartzite artefacts are rare: only two, both fine-grained, were found. One is a broken  flake with abrupt ventral retouching along one margin from XU11 in Square A (in Burning  Phase 4). The other is a broken medial flake with fine ventral retouching along one lateral margin  from XU10 in Square B (in Burning Phase 5). With a maximum width of 21.4 mm, this is  the third-largest fine-grained quartzite flake from Square B, suggesting that only flakes above  a certain size met the requirements for an extended use-life.  The only formal artefact type is an unretouched fine-grained quartzite blade, 40 mm long by  11 mm wide (from Square A XU28 in Burning Phase 3). Other raw materials Most chert artefacts are broken flakes (Tables 14.7 and 14.8). A bipolar chert core (21.1 mm  long, 2.73 g) from Square A indicates advanced reduction and raw material conservation. The  largest flake scar on the core is 14.3 mm long by 7.6 mm wide, indicating the production of  relatively small flakes. Complete chert flakes are also small, the only two examples from Square A  being 5.4 mm and 13.3 mm long; in Square B (n = 6) they are 3.3 mm to 12.9 mm long (average  = 5.5 mm). The use of bipolar percussion together with the making of small flakes indicates  a high degree of curation of this non-local resource. Both milky and crystal quartz artefacts are present. They include a distal bipolar flake from  Square A, and a bipolar core from Square B, all other quartz flakes being too small and fragmented  to ascertain how they were made. Water-rolled cortex on opposite sides of the bipolar core  indicates the collection of quartz nodules from creek beds or the quartzite rock matrix. Flaked artefacts made on chalcedony, silcrete and volcanic rock, all exotic raw materials, are few.  No retouch is evident.  Coarse-grained quartzite artefact conjoining on back wall One flaked piece from Square A XU29 is of particular importance for the painted panel with  bichrome anthropomorphs and red stick-figures above Square A: the ventral surface of the  XU29 flaked piece conjoins perfectly over two of the stick-figures (Images #15 and #36) and  indeterminate Image #43 (see below) (Figures 14.20 and 14.21). The XU29 artefact lay buried  flat in sandy deposit, at 50.7 cm depth. It was found exactly 15 cm south, 10 cm east and 1.05  m below its conjoin scar on the shallow overhang, part of rock wall stratum D2 above Square  A. None of the artefact’s surfaces are patinated, nor do they show any other signs of weathering.  The edges are sharp and use-wear is absent. The artefact is 7.4 cm long, 2.9 cm wide and 1.4 cm  thick, and weighs 36.1 g. The XU29 conjoining flaked piece’s dorsal surface (Figure 14.20) is convex and contains at least  three, and possibly four, uni-directional flake scars sub-parallel to the longitudinal axis; there is  no evidence of core rotation from these scars. It was once part of a larger block originally attached  to the now-exposed rock wall at strata D3/D2. That block became detached from the wall, after  which its convex dorsal surface was flaked, resulting in the creation of the excavated flaked piece.  The pronounced concave profile of the ventral surface of the excavated artefact, and the  matching convex profile of the stratum D2 wall surface, indicate that the excavated artefact  and the large block that originally contained it did not simply detach from the wall as a result  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="25"> 14.  Determining the age of paintings at JSARN–113/23, Jawoyn Country    395  of gravitational collapse. The absence of a striking platform, bulb of percussion, eraillure scar  and ripple marks on the ventral surface of the excavated artefact suggests that the block was not  removed from the wall by flaking. Rather, the curvature of the wall together with the position of  the buried artefact beneath its originating scar on the wall suggest that the block was detached  through thermal shock caused by fire; solar heat would have been insufficient, especially given  the shadiness of this low part of the shelter. Here, the considerable length of the convex scar is  testimony to the large volume of strata D3/D2 rock that collapsed, in the vicinity of 300 kg.  Images #1–#46 were painted on this newly created surface sometime after the block fell. It is not known whether the fire that caused the thermal shock was purposefully built by people  against the back wall, perhaps to quarry the rock, or whether it was a bushfire whose flames  happened to reach this part of the wall. Irrespective of the cause, sometime after detachment by  fire from the wall, the block was flaked, creating the dorsal scars on the artefact. Initial stages of  that flaking took place at ground level where the block fell, explaining the flaking debris in and  around XU29 of Square A.

It is very hard, measures 2.5 × 2.0 × 1.5 cm  and weighs 9.5 g. One convex, facetted surface  is covered with multi-directional striations  from grinding. All other surfaces are rough  and irregular. The excavated piece broke from  a larger crayon, probably during use, as evident  by the sectioned ground surface. Under ×50  magnification, particles of intense red powder,  each c. 10 μm wide, are seen near the centre of  the ground surface (Figure 14.23). Non-invasive analyses were undertaken both of  the ground and rough surfaces. The elemental  composition was determined by portable X-ray  fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer (S1 Titan, Figure 14.22 Red ochre crayon from Square A  Bruker, 10 and 30 kV, 30s of acquisition time, XU26. analysed area = 0.5 × 0.5 mm) (Table 14.11).

X-ray diffraction (XRD) (INEL, Co anode, 5–120 θ angular domain) confirms the predominance  of haematite Fe2O3 and quartz SiO2 with an undefined secondary aluminosilicate phase on the  rough surface. These two latter phases (quartz SiO2 and aluminosilicate) can be attributed to  the fine sediments trapped in micro-cavities of the rough surface. XRD also confirms a well- crystallised phase of relatively pure haematite for the ground surface.

The art on the wall Much of the lower half of the hard quartzite wall is covered by a c. 1 mm thick, red-coloured  rock skin. Here red paintings abound, many of which are hard to distinguish from the red crust  because of their similar colours. Broad sections of this red crust have detached or been removed  from the wall, exposing a fresh, light-coloured surface beneath. On that underlying surface,  paintings are easier to make out. Exfoliation scars a few centimetres long also occur on both  painted and unpainted parts of the cortex (see below). All rock surfaces were examined in the field and photographed. The digital photographs were  scrutinised for rock art both prior to and following computer enhancement in Adobe Photoshop  CS6 and DStretch. Paintings were observed in three areas, which we refer to as ‘Wall 1’, ‘Wall 2’  and ‘Wall 3’ rather than ‘panels’, because the art is variably spread on each wall rather than  necessarily forming spatially delimited art panels (Tables 14.12 and 14.13; Figure 14.24).

Sixty-seven (57 per cent) of these are distinct enough to make out their shapes;  the other 50 are too degraded and thus treated as ‘indeterminate’ (Figure 14.25).

Zoomorphs A single red-outlined echidna is depicted in plan-view on Wall 1 (faunal identifications  are descriptions that resemble extant local fauna; they were not made from local Jawoyn  identifications). It has irregularly criss-crossing straight lines inside its body and short parallel  lines (quills) extending around its entire perimeter (Figure 14.27). The juncture between the  head and body is partly exfoliated. Two small, red-outlined and white-infilled flying-foxes (Figure  14.28, Images #90 and #91) are also on Wall 1; they are superimposed over a red stick-figure  anthropomorph (#92) and six indeterminate red images (#93–#95 and #97–#99). The flying- foxes are horizontal with triangular faces and ears. Nearby are the tail and legs (with back feet) of  a macropod (#113) superimposed over a red indeterminate image (#96); the upper section of the  macropod has weathered away. A probable macropod, bandicoot or, less likely, possum (#76) is  on Wall 3. It is depicted in profile view with a long, curving tail, small triangular ear and infilled  body with curved lines (Figure 14.29).  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="33"> 14.

They describe Ngar-mimi paintings as having ‘a large, round, infilled  headdress placed centrally over a thin stick-like body that bifurcates into a pair of parallel  stick-like legs, with a pair of short, straight arms (at c. 45° to the body) holding a limited  array of accoutrements’. One of the Ngar-mimi figures at JSARN–113/23 has a well-defined,  red-infilled circular head, two short arms angled downward and the upper half of a torso; the  lower parts of the torso and legs have been removed by a single large flake scar (Figure 14.34).  The second example is on (or in) red cortex that makes the red painting more difficult to  discern (Figure 14.33, #55). Like its better-defined counterpart, it has a red-infilled circular  head from which emanate two short, downward-angled arms and a torso; the torso is shorter  than those of most other Ngar-mimi figures in Jawoyn Country.  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="36"> 406    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia Figure 14.32 Yellow stick-figure (#61) on Wall 2.

The  function(s) of the hooked sticks depicted  in Arnhem Land rock art is uncertain: they  may represent spear-throwers, fighting  picks or ‘some other artefact’, with more  precise identification relying on context  (Lewis 1988:15). To the right of, and  parallel with, the hooked-stick is a vertical  line with a  ‘top knob’ (Figures 14.35 and  14.36, #68) akin to a spear or light club. The anthropomorphs with ‘beehive’  headdresses are similar in form to paintings  from other parts of western Arnhem Land  attributed to the Hooked Stick period by  Lewis, and that are associated with paintings  of hooked sticks (e.g. Lewis 1988:238, 244).  Lewis (1988:92) has a ‘loose estimate of  about 9000 BP’ for the start of hooked stick  depictions, and c. 6000 BP for its ending.

They were all painted after the large block of rock had detached from the wall through thermal  shock, as described above; here the art must have been painted sometime, or at various times,  after that event that exposed the present rock surface (see below). This now-painted, fresh,  curved surface is c. 140 cm long and mostly c. 35 cm wide; it is perched parallel to the floor.  That fresh surface extends further to the southwest as it curves around the back wall, where  at times it approaches c. 50 cm width. The two red-outlined and yellow-infilled paintings  (#40, #41) are found at the southern end of this fresh surface. Here, Image #40 is horizontal,  with arms and legs bent at the elbows and knees, head pointing upwards towards the top  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="39"> 14.  Determining the age of paintings at JSARN–113/23, Jawoyn Country    409  of the frieze; it has fingers and toes, and its ‘headdress’ has two E-shaped, winged features  emanating from either side. The other bichrome anthropomorph (#41) is juxtaposed to that  horizontal one; it is vertical with raised arms bent at the elbows, and legs bent at the knees  (see Figure 14.37). The upper half of the head extends onto the unexfoliated surface, where it  is partly covered by a wasp nest. A yellow-infilled anthropomorph (#42) is less clear than the  two bichrome anthropomorphs, and may originally have been part of a larger image involving  two copulating anthropomorphs, but it is too faded to be certain (see below).

One group has seven stick-figures linked hand- to-hand (#23–#29), next to another group of nine stick-figures (#30–#37). At the northern  end of that row of 16 stick-figures are an oval with vertical line (#38), and a complex linear  design (#39) (Figure 14.38). terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="40"> 410    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia • A second row of anthropomorphs consists of five stick-figures (some with fingers, eyes and  ears) (#1–#5), again aligned hand-to-hand, next to a tri-pointed spear (#6) and barbed spear  (#7) (see  below). That frieze continues northward with a group of nine anthropomorphs  depicted in a variety of ways, but always red linear or infilled (#8–#18).

Determining the age of paintings at JSARN–113/23, Jawoyn Country    411  Items of material culture As previously mentioned, two paintings of spears are present amidst a row of stick-figures near  the base of Wall 2 (Figure 14.38, #6 and #7). One of these, Image #6, is what Lewis (1988:306  and elsewhere) calls a ‘tri-pointed spear’ of a ‘type unknown in the ethnographic record’. He  attributes such spears to his Broad Spearthrower period, which he estimates to have begun a  maximum 6000 years ago and ended by at least 1000–2000 years ago (see Lewis 1988:95–98, 105,  324, 325). Lewis places such spear depictions sometime within this period because tri-pointed  spears are often associated with images of lanceolate spearheads that, for the first time in the art  sequence, resemble stone points that first appear in excavations c. 6000 years ago. Furthermore,  the Broad Spearthrower period art that has images of tri-pointed spears also has depictions of  fauna that became extinct c. 3500–3000 years ago: The Tasmanian tiger (Thylacinus cynocephalus)  and, apparently somewhat later, the Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii). It is during this phase  that colours other than red first become regularly apparent, a product of preservation rather  than the real commencement of painting in multiple colours (Lewis 1988:95). This period  includes what Brandl (1973) had called Late Mimi art, and it possibly but uncertainly continues  until the beginning of early X-ray art (Lewis 1988:97–98). Chaloupka has no depictions of  tri-pointed spears in his discussions of spears in the art (cf. Chaloupka 1993:146–148). An age  between 6000 and 3000 years ago for the tri-pointed spear is consistent with our findings at  site JSARN–113/23, which dates the underlying and therefore older red-and-yellow bichrome  anthropomorphs to 9260–9540 cal BP (see below).  The second spear painting, Image #7, is next to the tri-pointed spear and part of the same  painted scene (Figure 14.38). This painting has a multi-pronged spearhead with a thickened  base (probably indicating hafting), a kind of spear depiction also found in, but not restricted to,  the Broad Spearthrower period (e.g. Lewis 1988:325, 367) (see below). Chaloupka (1993:146)  identifies ‘composite spears’ with ‘uniserially barbed wooden heads, with barbs cut in the solid  and attached to the wooden shaft’, such as the one discussed here, as first appearing in his Simple  Figures with Boomerangs style, which he suggests came after both Dynamic and Post-Dynamic  Figures, during the late Pre-Estuarine Period, which he estimates to date shortly before 8000  years ago. Such multi-barbed uniserial composite spears continue into subsequent styles, and  could thus date to any time after the start of the Simple Figures with Boomerangs style. We have already discussed the single example of a hooked stick in the art of JSARN–113/23  (Figure 14.35, #69; see above).  Non-figurative images The non-figurative paintings are straight lines  (n = 4) and one image each of an arc, an oval  and straight line, a circular shape, a circular  shape and linear infill, a simple linear design,  a  dash cluster and a complex linear design  (e.g. Figure 14.40, #83, #84).  Wall 1 has a red-painted cluster of 48 dashes  surrounding the end of a horizontal straight  line (Figure 14.41, #49). Some of the dashes  are damaged by exfoliation. There is also a complex set of lines associated Figure 14.40 Non-figurative images (#83, #84)  with the row of stick-figures in the lower on Wall 1. section of Wall 2 (Figure 14.38, #39).

Superimposition in the art The paintings include scenes dominated by rows of anthropomorphs on the fresh surface of the  lower section of Wall 2 above Square A: this is where 32 (73 per cent) of the anthropomorphs  occur, including the distinctive bichrome outlined/infilled motifs, and the stick-figures linked  hand-to-hand. This localised panel closest to the archaeological excavations contains 41 per cent  (n = 46) of the 113 paintings at the site.  Several superimpositions offer insights into painting episodes, style changes and the sequencing  of motifs. On Wall 1, a macropod (#113) overlies an indeterminate red image (#96); here the  macropod is also superimposed by a white-infilled anthropomorph (#78) that also superimposes  a yellow anthropomorph (#89) and various other indeterminate white, yellow and red images  (#79, #102, #103–#105, #112). A second set of superimpositions on Wall 1 has two red- outlined and white-infilled flying-foxes (#90, #91) over a composition of red indeterminate lines  (probably weathered anthropomorphs, #93–#95, #97, #99), a red stick-figure (#92) and an off- white indeterminate image (#98) (Figure 14.28). The white of the flying-foxes is noticeably  clearer and fresher than the red images, suggesting that some time had elapsed between painting  episodes. Based on these superimpositions and levels of clarity, the red paintings (#92–#97, #99)  were the earliest, followed by the macropod (#113) and the indeterminate off-white image (#98),  followed by the red-outlined and white-infilled flying-foxes (#90, #91), with significant amounts  of time elapsing between painting episodes.  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="44"> 414    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia On Wall 2, superimpositions consist of the beeswax line-and-dots image (#56) over an  indeterminate red painting (#57) (Figure 14.43), and a beeswax dot cluster (#64), as well as  a yellow indeterminate over a red indeterminate painting; the beeswax figures are the most  recent. As one of these (#56) has a calibrated age of 310–440 cal BP (see above), the underlying  indeterminate red painting (#57) must be older.

The fresh, curved rock surface caused by thermal shock (see above) near the base of Wall 2, just  above Square A, also has a number of superimpositions, the major ones being (see Figure 14.45  for a full list): • The two bichrome infilled and outlined anthropomorphs (#40, #41) are superimposed by  two red stick-figures (#25, #26) in the row of seven linked stick-figures (#23-#29), part of  a larger scene (#23–#39). • The yellow anthropomorph(s) of Image #42, and the other, indeterminate yellow paintings  (#44, #45) nearby, are superimposed by Images #28–#32, part of the red stick-figure scene  (#23–#39). These superimpositions are consistent with the apparent contemporaneity of the  two bichrome anthropomorphs (#40, #41) with the other yellow paintings (#42, #44, #45)  that, as a group, together represent the underlying and therefore oldest art layer on this surface. • Overlying both the yellow and red Images #40–#42, #44 and #45 of the lowermost art  layer, and the next layer up as represented by the red scene of Images #23–#39, is a third,  uppermost and thus most recent layer of red paintings (#1–#22). This too is a scene, all in red:  the stick-figures appear with more embellished heads, two spears and varied linear and infilled  anthropomorphs (Figure 14.46). From youngest to oldest, four superimposed painting layers can thus be identified on the frieze  above Square A:  • Layer 1 = Images #1–#22 (Figure 14.46C).  • Layer 2 = Images #23–#39 (Figure 14.46B). • Layer 3 = Images #43, #46: red lines of a slightly different hue to the red outlines of the  bichrome anthropomorphs (#40, #41), and different also to those of the red paintings in  Layers 1 and 2 (Figure 14.46A). They are similar in hue to some red images in Layer 4, so may  be contemporaneous with that layer (see also the Harris Matrix in Figure 14.45). • Layer 4 = Images #40–#42, #44, #45 (Figure 14.46A). terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="45"> 14.

Painting Layers 1, 2 and 4 are distinctive from each other in their modes of representation, colour,  clarity and general degree of preservation. Each contains a scene that is somewhat different from  the other, each made during a single painting event. Layers 1 (#1–#22) and 2 (#23–#39), the most recent and middle layers respectively, each have  a  row of stick-figures on the left (as one views the painted scenes) next to a less tightly knit  group of anthropomorphs and other depictions to their right. The two scenes are similar in  composition, yet somewhat different in their individual paintings. We do not know if they were  painted over a short period of time, such as by two separate artists in a single occupation, or  over two shortly spaced events that, for example, required re-invigoration of the original scene,  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="46"> 416    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia or whether they represent two essentially separate sets of depiction separated by a longer span  of time. Either way, the lower scene (Layer 2) must to some degree have inspired the upper one  (Layer 1), given their overlap and similarity of composition. Discussion: An archaeomorphological history for the art From bottom to top, the art of JSARN–113/23 spans 3.5 m of rock wall in a sequence of 14  stacked rock strata (Figure 14.47). Each stratum is distinctive in its thickness, upper and lower  surface joint morphologies, mineralogy and grain structure. We can thus try to understand better  the history of the art by investigating the history of the exposed ends of the rock strata (the rock  surfaces) that carry it. We achieved this result by studying the fallen rocks on the ground, in  the excavated sediments, and through the GPR data, relating each to the wall strata and to  the radiocarbon dates to determine when the decorated rock surfaces formed, thereby offering  maximum ages for the images. Figure 14.47 Bedrock strata, with interpretative cross-section showing the location of where the  Square A XU29 flaked piece that fitted the rock surface above was found. Source: Photograph and illustration by Jean-Jacques Delannoy. The individual rocks, and the sediment samples, from the excavated deposits were analysed and  matched to their sources. Particle size analysis and morphoscopy (shape and surface characteristics)  of the sediment grains indicate aeolian deposition, with most grains derived from quartzite.  The size and shape of the excavated and surface rocks range from large slabs several metres long  to smaller pieces centimetres long. The largest rocks – metres to tens of centimetres in length –  have been matched to particular strata in the rock stack through their geological characteristics.  The outer ends of the wall strata indicate that four major processes of rock fall have taken place.  Each has left its own, distinctive type of scar on the wall, including on its overhangs: terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="47"> 14.  Determining the age of paintings at JSARN–113/23, Jawoyn Country    417  1. Gravity (overhang collapse), which mainly affects rock overhangs. Gravitational collapse  results in sub-angular (typically with right or perpendicular angles) remnant-edge  morphologies. It is responsible for the progressive increase in the elevation of shelter floors  (due to large blocks accumulating on the ground) and the retreat of overhangs. Gravitational  collapse causes blocks of rock to exhibit clean breaks along joints and fissure planes. On the  ground, collapsed blocks have angular edges, their thickness more or less corresponding to  the thickness of the originating rock strata (and those of the remnant overhangs). Given the  hardness and poorly soluble nature of the local quartzite, the source of collapsed blocks is  usually relatively easy to identify. 2. Thermal shock, where intense heating causes sections of the wall to fracture. Convex wall  surfaces near ground level are often shaped by thermal shock. Fires, either from camps,  anthropic burning of the landscape or natural bushfires, cause curved sections of wall to  detach, sometimes over distances measuring several metres (e.g. see the curved rock wall at  D3/D2 on Figure 14.47). Rock variably conducts heat, and in so doing also variably resists heat and thermal shock.  But it also tends to shatter when exposed to high temperatures, the depth of detachment  representing the critical threshold between the heated rock outside and the non-heated matrix  inside. Shattering takes place at the location of maximum heat, causing detachments that  can be from a few centimetres to a few tens of centimetres thick, depending on the type of  rock at stake. Where heating has been minimal, the detached rock tends to be thinner. The  inner, conjoining face of a detached block is typically sub-parallel to what was previously the  exposed face of the wall (now the dorsal face of the detached rock). Thermal shock can affect a rock wall in a number of ways; evidence of each can be seen at  JSARN–113/23:  a. Laterally and vertically highly localised detachment scars, corresponding to locations of  maximum heating. b. The morphology of a detached rock surface reflects more the original rock wall surface  morphology than the wall’s stratigraphy, and in this differs from detachments caused by  gravitational force (see Point 1 above). c. Detachment surfaces are curved and smooth, demarcating the boundary between the  underlying unheated rock (the remaining, undetached part of the rock wall) and the  overlying heated rock (the detached rock). Thermal shock is accentuated by brutal cooling, such as when a heated wall is rapidly cooled  with water. Rocks shattered from thermal shock typically have sharp edges. 3. Thermoclastic exfoliation, caused by water and salt seeping through the matrix, compounding  the expansion and contraction of rock surfaces through day–night temperature changes.  This leads to the sub-centimetre deep exfoliation of rock surfaces (e.g. Figures 14.27, 14.29,  14.31 and 14.41). Exfoliated spalls are small, centimetre(s)-long, thin lenses of rock that retain on their dorsal  surfaces the features of the original rock wall surface. A number of processes can cause  exfoliation, such as the repeated expansion and contraction of micro-fractures (typically  through day–night humidity and temperature fluctuations), or low-temperature thermal  shock. At JSARN–113/23, spalls are unlikely to have exfoliated from mechanical weakening  of the rock such as along micro-fractures, as quartzite surfaces do not regularly fracture in this  way. On the other hand, solar heating of the wall (thermoclastic exfoliation) is a likely cause,  as it only affects the outer surface of the rock, notably where there is a red ‘patina’ caused  either by an alteration, or by a reddening, of the rock through fire (from nearby bushfires  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="48"> 418    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia or campfires, or intentional heating of the rock face), or by the application of red ochre.  Whatever caused the JSARN–113/23 wall surface to redden, it is only here that exfoliation  scars are found (e.g. Figures 14.27, 14.31, 14.33 and 14.43). The darker (reddened) surface  covers a lighter parent rock, absorbing more heat than it reflects. Exfoliated spalls have  detached at the level of contact between the outer surface heated by solar radiation, and  the inner, non-heated rock. We can see the effects of exfoliation caused by solar radiation in  the colour contrast between the underlying, unaltered and unreddened rock exposed by the  exfoliation scars and the thin, reddened rock skin above it. 4. Anthropogenic flaking, identified by impact marks left by hammer blows on localised parts  of the wall. Figures 14.48 and 14.49 summarise the evidence for each of these processes at JSARN–113/23.  Three phases of natural overhang collapse (‘gravity’) are evident from remnant wall configurations  and corresponding buried blocks (Phases 1–3 on Figure 14.49). These collapses caused progressive  retreat of the relatively high and outermost overhanging strata (D14 and higher), together with  a localised retreat of the wall at D13/D12 and D9/D8. The excavations did not penetrate deep  enough to sufficiently expose, and thereby date, the collapsed blocks from the earliest two of  these three phases, but they must all be older than 27,000 cal BP. The deepest radiocarbon date  from Square A comes from near rocks that fell from D9/D8 (Phase 3), indicating that the most  recent of those three phases dates to c. 26,190–26,680 cal BP. Any art on these upper sections  of the present wall at D8 or higher (Images #47–#53, #73–#75; Table 14.13) must therefore be  younger than c. 27,000 cal BP, as this is when the present surface was created.

The largely uninterrupted  curvature of the D3/D2 scar indicates a single detachment event. This happened at a time when  soft sediments were being deposited on the shelter floor. Sometime after the block (or blocks)  became thermally detached from D3/D2, it was flaked by people as it lay on the shelter floor,  as evident by the clearly artefactual Square A XU29 conjoining flaked piece excavated from  a level dated to 12,980–13,210 cal BP (Figure 14.20). Thermal shock detachments originating  from the light-coloured section of wall along D3/D2 (see Figures 14.21 and 14.47) are also  found slightly deeper than the conjoining flaked piece. It is on this light-coloured section of the  detachment scar that the superimposed layers of red-and-yellow bichrome anthropomorphs and  related images (#40–#46) and stick-figures (middle Layer 2: #23–#39; upper Layer 1: #1–#22)  are located (Figures 14.37 and 14.38), indicating that none of those paintings (#1–#46) can be  older than c. 12,980–13,210 cal BP.  The excavated conjoining flaked piece from Square A XU29 shows that the curving, hard  quartzite wall surface from which it originated, low down in the shelter and well-protected from  the elements, has remained relatively fresh and devoid of cortex for 13,210–12,980 years. This  is significant, as it shows that other unpatinated hard quartzite wall surfaces in western Arnhem  Land – let alone heavily patinated ones – could have great antiquity, with implications for better  understanding the age of paintings on those surfaces. The excavated ochre crayon from Square A XU26 came from just above the conjoining flaked  piece, at a level of peak charcoal deposition near the back wall. A radiocarbon date from this  charcoal dates the crayon to 9260–9540 cal BP (Burning Phase 3). There is a minimum 2.3 cm  and maximum 5.4 cm of contemporaneous soft sediment above the ochre crayon; that depth  range represents the thickness of XU26 within which the crayon was excavated. The sequence,  then, has  the detachment of the block from the wall c. 12,980–13,210 cal BP (based  on  geomorphological evidence), followed by the making of paintings 9260–9540 cal BP (based  on paintings on the detachment scar, and the presence of a buried use-worn ochre crayon beneath  the paintings on that scar).  If the crayon was used for the red outline of the two bichrome anthropomorphs (Figure 14.46A,  #40, #41) then they would date to 9260–9540 cal BP. This scene is the lowermost layer of art  on that frieze, as indicated by the superimpositions. These paintings are also the most faded on  the frieze. The two yellow anthropomorphs with ‘beehive’ headdresses (Figure 14.35, #66, #71)  extend past the yellow hooked stick (#69), spear/club (#68) and bichrome anthropomorphs  (#40, #41) as part of the same frieze on the curved thermal scar of stratum D3. This suggests that  this entire frieze of red-and-yellow paintings is contemporaneous and belongs to Lewis’s (1988)  Hooked Stick period; this is consistent with the radiocarbon dates and geomorphological history  presented above. This interpretation is also consistent with the pattern of superimpositions, which  has 1) the combined red-outlined, yellow-infilled anthropomorphs and yellow anthropomorphs  with ‘beehive headdresses’ associated with the yellow hooked stick, superimposed by 2) the row  of red stick-figures associated with the tri-pointed spear of the subsequent Broad Spearthrower  period. This chronostratigraphic order matches Lewis’s (1988) schema. The above interpretation has the scene with Images #23–#39 painted after 9260–9540 cal BP,  followed some time later by that with Images #1–#22. We do not know how much time elapsed  between these painting events. This dating matches both Lewis’s (1988) and Chaloupka’s (1993)  chronological models, each of which has the painted spears of the uppermost Layer 1 dating  between the early Holocene and c. 3000 years ago, although we need to remember that their  modelled ages are estimates not based on actual dates for art. terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="51"> 14.  Determining the age of paintings at JSARN–113/23, Jawoyn Country    421  The alternative would be that the excavated ochre crayon was used to paint one of the two scenes  with red stick-figures. In that scenario, the underlying Layer 4 with the bichrome anthropomorphs  (and possibly the two sets of red lines in Layer 3) would date between 12,980–13,210 cal BP  (age of the rock surface) and 9260–9540 cal BP (age of the crayon). Either way, the frieze with  the bichrome red-and-yellow figures, yellow anthropomorphs with ‘beehive’ headdresses, hooked  stick and spear/club would date to either 9260–9540 cal BP (a phase associated with peak burning  – Burning Phase 3), or between 12,980–13,210 cal BP and 9260–9540 cal BP. It is always possible that the excavated ochre crayon was used for body decoration or the painting  of portable items of material culture rather than to create rock art, but that explanation is not  entirely satisfactory given that the used ochre crayon was excavated from Square A in deposits  immediately below the localised D3/D2 painted frieze, under a low and shallow, cramped  overhang where buried cultural materials are likely to be related to activities in the immediate  proximity. Finally, elsewhere in the shelter, sections of overhanging D9/D8 fell sometime before 12,160– 12,750 cal BP, with possible minor episodic collapses continuing until 9260–9540 cal BP to  5910–6650 cal BP (Phase 5) (Figure 14.49). We do not know if these overhang collapses were  caused by knapping events, natural gravitational pull or other factors. Irrespective of cause, it is  then that the jumbled rocks exposed at the base of the Square B (see Figure 14.10), including  the rock for the grindstones, became detached from D9/D8. Given the numerous instances of  flaking and, to a lesser extent, grinding on excavated blocks, this entire Phase 5 event is probably  anthropic, even if the whole of the rock collapse was not anticipated.  We did not find any evidence of subsequent major phases of rock modification other than  localised thermoclastic exfoliation over painted sections of the wall.
