<plain_text><page sequence="1">"A World Complete In Itself": Gatsby's Elegiac Narration Dan Coleman The only general attribute of projected romance . . . is the fact [that it deals with] experience disengaged, disembroiled, disen- cumbered, exempt from the conditions that we usually know to attach to it The balloon of experience is in fact of course tied to the earth, and under that necessity we swing, thanks to a rope of remarkable length, in the more or less commodious car of the imagi- nation; but it is by the rope we know where we are, and from the moment that cable is cut we are at large and unrelated .The art of the romancer is, 'for the fun of it,' insidiously to cut the cable, to cut it without our detecting him.-Henry James, preface to The American [I]n my new novel I'm thrown directly on purely creative work- not trashy imaginings as in my stories but the sustained imagina- tion of a sincere and yet radiant world. -F.E Scott Fitzgerald, letter to Maxwell Perkins' Nick Carraway begins his story by describing how it will end. "Gatsby turned out all right," he explains, " it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men" (6-7). By insisting from his narrative's outset on its hero's happy ending, Nick sets for himself an essentially elegiac ambition: to ensure that his readers come to the last page of the novel convinced that Gatsby is "something gorgeous" (6). At the same time, the clarity with which Nick defines his narrative's end invites us to consider the rest of his story as a means, to study the functions of its form,</page><page sequence="2">208 J N T to consider how-and how well-Gatsby's parts cooperate or conflict with the achievement of its whole. By taking our bearings from Nick's clearly articulated purpose, we might steer clear of the twin perils described by Ro- man Jakobson in his critique of "linguist[s] deaf to the poetic function of language and... literary scholar[s] indifferent to linguistic problems" (377). That is to say: the telos by which Nick tries so intently to organize his narra- tive offers us an excellent opportunity to explore how a novel's formal struc- tures create its aesthetic effects. However, the attempt to identify Nick's elegiac ambition with Gatsby's informing design poses serious problems: neither Nick's sense of Gatsby's happy ending nor his ability to persuade us of it turns out to be as sure and stable as at first they seem. Returned to its context, Nick's affirmation of Gatsby's ultimate success suggests his underlying uncertainty; within the speech in which it occurs, the clear note of Nick's assertion begins to quaver: [T]here was something gorgeous about [Gatsby] ... a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No-Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded ela- tions of men. (6-7) The sentence that ends by insisting on Gatsby's distinction from the corrup- tion which surrounded him, begins by responding to a question that hasn't been asked (No-Gatsby turned out all right at the end). Nick's triumphant declaration of his hero's happy ending must overcome his own equivocation; it is not simply an assertion but an answer. Although ostensibly alone, Nick protests as if defending his claim against another speaker. "To whom," we might wonder, "is Nick saying 'No'?" It might be that Nick responds to a silent part of himself, a skeptical inner voice so forceful that Nick must deny it "aloud." If so, Nick's "No" reveals the sense in which this narrator's commitment to making his hero turn out all right cannot be separated from his uncertainty about whether or not Gatsby really did. From this perspective, the same tension exposed by the content of Nick's closing speech-i.e., Nick's immense admiration for a man who "rep- resented everything for which [he has] an unaffected scorn"-shows up in its dialogic form, through the crack in Nick's narrative voice (7).2</page><page sequence="3">Elegiac Narration in Gatsby 209 Drawn back-and-forth between fascination and skepticism, Nick's story is simultaneously an elegiac fiction that aims to make sure that everything turns out all right-and a "history of the summer" that tries to make sense of what really happened (10). In this respect, the ambivalence of Nick's narra- tive is matched by the precariousness of his narratorial authority. Because he is not only the ostensible writer of this story but a character within it, Nick lacks a privileged position outside the fiction's frame. Unlike a more power- ful author, Nick cannot ensure that any apparent competition with his own Last Word is really just a game whose outcome has been decided ahead of time, a fight rigged from the start. Since Nick's narrative voice can never completely transcend that plane on which the other characters speak-nor silence that skepticism in himself which whispers against any simple faith in his hero-Nick's control of the narrative is always uncertain and his ability to bring Gatsby to a happy ending is always in doubt. Any power Nick may possess to make Gatsby turn out all right is not given but accomplished; any ring of authority his words may achieve will never be pure but, instead, al- ways colored by his struggle to achieve it. The history of the summer, then, is also the history of Nick's attempts as a narrator to find a voice with which he can conjure around his hero "a world complete in itself" where "[e]ven Gatsby could happen" (110, 73). (Recon)figuring the Facts: Metaphoric Worlds With this uncertain "sense of an ending" before his eyes, Nick opens his story by identifying its origin: "and the history of the summer really begins on the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom Buchanans" (10).3 However, Nick's description of "the white palaces of fashionable East Egg glitter[ing] along the water" seems less the material of history than the stuff that fairy tales are made of (10). Unable or unwilling to draw clearly those boundaries which distinguish the Actual from the Imaginary, Nick's narrative begins by creating an uneasy commerce between the two. Compelled by Tom into the living room of his fashionable East Egg man- sion, Nick enters a "bright, rosy-colored space" in which The only completely stationary object . .. was an enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon. They were both in white and their</page><page sequence="4">210 J N T dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house. I must have stood for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall. Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room and the curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor. (12) The conceit of the balloon, which begins with a simile's qualifications (as if, as though), moves through the collocation created by the "whip and snap of the curtains" and the hyperbolic "groan of a picture on the wall" to end by almost escaping its figurative tethers. Over the course of Nick's description, the balloon-like couch becomes a couch-balloon that settles-like any real balloon would-because the wind which suspended it has died out. That is to say: a metaphor which is initially, obviously impossible (we know that couches can't really float) and clearly subordinated to the reality it describes (i.e., as the image is supposed to help us understand the sense in which the couch "floats") ultimately becomes entirely plausible, existing independently in that strange new world the metaphor makes. In other words, this passage takes its readers from a "realistic" place where a simile can fancifully com- pare a couch to a balloon, to a world in which there really are couch-bal- loons-a magical universe furnished with facts entirely alien to ours, but regulated by wholly familiar laws of cause and effect. Nick's description reverses the usual literal-figurative hierarchy; his fantastic trope momen- tarily warps reality around it. Like "the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house," Nick's metaphor crosses that boundary which separates the ordinary from the fantastic, warping the novel's world by means well-described by Dorothy Mack (12). "Metaphoring," she argues, "is . . . more than saying something; it is fabricating another 'reality.' In choosing to extend the scope of a particular presupposition to a particular topic, the speaker imposes a way of seeing, feeling, connecting, and judging; he forces his unique and momentary 'world-creating' and 'contrary-to-fact' perspective on the hearer" (84). Along similar lines, Samuel Levin has suggested that most readers, when faced by a metaphor that misrepresents what they know to be true of the world, typically revise their construal of the literal meaning of the words (e.g., "her lips are not really roses, but red in the way that roses are"). Read-</page><page sequence="5">Elegiac Narration in Gatsby 211 ers have, however, another option: instead of treating their ideas of the world as stable and the metaphor's meaning as changeable, they can "[take] the metaphoric expression literally and [accept] the epistemological consequences that ensue" (Metaphoric Worlds 4): [A]lthough preternatural states of affairs cannot be conceived as actually existing, the possibility of their existing can be conceived of: We can form a conception of what the world would have to be like were it in fact to comprise such states of affairs .... If we read in a poem "the sky is angry," we con- ceive of a world in which the sky might be angry; in the same way, the wind might be hungry, the stars happy, and so on. The usual process of construal is simply inverted; instead of constructing an interpretation that consists with conditions in the actual world, we construct one that conforms to the actual language of the utterance. In consequence what emerges as metaphoric is not the language in which the poem is expressed, but the world that language has caused us to project. We have projected ourselves into a metaphoric world. ("Language 121") This world where language is taken literally is one in which Nick's narra- tive invites us to spend much of our readerly time. Throughout the novel, the transformative effects of Nick's metaphors are reinforced by his habit of changing similes which compare A and B into metaphors which equate A and B-or even into substitutions by means of which A takes the place of B. This tendency to take rhetorical figures "seriously" marks Nick's narrative from its beginning; within the scope of a single page in the first chapter, Jordan is transformed-like the couch that briefly "becomes" a balloon- from someone whose chin is "raised a little as if she were balancing some- thing on it" into "the balancing girl." At the same time, the "something" that Jordan seemed to Nick to be balancing-which initially exists only hypo- thetically as an analogy that Nick draws for his readers ("her chin [was] raised a little as if she were balancing something on it")4-becomes an ac- tual presence within that story-world shared by Nick and the novel's other characters: "the object she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something of a fright" (13). The process of "taking literally" by which Gatsby's metaphors disrupt our readerly expectations is insightfully analyzed by Leonard Podis. "[M]ost of Nick's markedly anti-realistic metaphors," he argues, " ... take place in</page><page sequence="6">212 J N T the contexts of what seem to be nearly surreal excursions. The metaphors usually occur in clusters, such that the experiences which are being set forth attain almost visionary status" (64). In the clusters that Podis analyzes, a series of "non-rational" metaphors pile one upon the next until their accumu- lation of incredible claims begins to outweigh the reader's sense of the novel's realism. Nick's description of Gatsby's ultimate vision exemplifies this over- whelming: He must have looked up at an unfamiliar sky through fright- ening leaves and shivered as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was upon the scarcely cre- ated grass. A new world, material without being real, where poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, drifted fortuitously about ... like that ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward him through the amorphous trees. (quoted in Podis 63) "The epithets employed here," Podis argues, " 'unfamiliar sky,' 'frightening leaves,' 'grotesque .. rose,' 'raw sunlight,' and 'scarcely created grass'- are all metaphorical in that the adjectives are to a degree ... incompatible with the nouns they modify" (63-64). While not "radically" non-rational, Podis contends, these "semantic clashes" begin to "challenge our ability to conceptualize them rationally" (69, 64). Not, however, until the second half of the passage does Nick's mix of metaphors start to disturb his readers' sense of the basic continuity between the reality represented within the novel and the one they're used to. Though spelled out clearly, the analogy which asks us to imagine ghosts "breathing dreams like air" makes no ordinary sense; dreams have no qualities in common with the stuff we breathe: "None of the presuppositions which come attached to the term 'dreams' will match up with the specifications of the metaphor. The only alternative [left to the reader] is to create new suppositions about 'dreams,' suppositions which in- volve a highly subjective way of seeing" (64). Nick's report of a "figure gliding..,. through the trees" creates similar kinds of difficulties for readers trying to construe it: "The presuppositions attached to 'gliding' will allow the word to be applied to a person on a dance floor, but the stretching of vision to connect this action with a gunman stalking his human target pro- duces a bizarre, distorted effect" (64). However, Podis's illuminating study fails to account for the full range of powers exercised by Gatsby's metaphors. A more complete analysis would</page><page sequence="7">Elegiac Narration in Gatsby 213 also shed light on how these figures can "work together" not only cumula- tively, but cooperatively. Podis's explanation of how Nick's weird descrip- tions can add up to "cause everyday reality to disintegrate into an amorphous other-world" overlooks the ways in which they can also cause the novel's fantastic reality to hold together (64). For example: while the premises un- derlying Nick's description of Daisy and Jordan's couch-balloon are indeed "other-worldly," the logic which informs this other-world is both familiar and coherent. In the same way, there is an internal consistency that binds together Nick's early description of the novel's landscape, and makes it seem not so unreasonable that there should be "a pair of enormous eggs" in "the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound" (9).5 "Eggs" is attracted to "barnyards" by the same force that binds together the figure underlying the image of gentle ballooning which runs beneath Nick's description of Daisy and Jordan on the couch. As W. J. Harvey ex- plains, "buoyed" and "anchored" continue a nautical theme which begins in the preceding paragraph's Homeric allusion (wine-colored rug) and extends into the "rippling and fluttering" of the women's dresses, the "whip and snap of the curtains" and the "groan of a picture on the wall."6 Thematically inter- related, all of these words are part of the same linguistic "collocation," a term nicely explained by Ronald Carter as "the company habitually kept by a word" (159).7 Like a conversation between paranoiacs whose perspectives are warped in exactly the same way (or alternatively: like the crazy banter that bounces between the guests around the Mad Hatter's tea table) the vi- sions of the world presented by Gatsby's fantastic metaphors grow compel- ling by their consensus. And the more successfully they collude together, the more likely we are as readers to take their common fantasy for granted, to consider a couch floating like a balloon or a lawn running like a horse as not particularly unusual. That is to say: Nick's metaphorical networks, while often "anti-realistic," are not always "non-rational." The "surreal excursions" on which Nick's metaphors invite his readers may take them to a place whose "unreality" is made coherent by the mutually corroborating claims of the metaphors which constitute it (Gatsby 105). Recalcitrant Railroads, Ash Men, and the Eyes of T. J. Eckleburg: Animate Landscapes in the Valley of Ashes Indeed, those fantastic worlds created within Nick's extended metaphors threaten at times to take over the novel's reality altogether:</page><page sequence="8">214 J N T About half way between West Egg and New York the motor- road hastily joins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile so as to shrink away from a certain desolate area of land. This is a valley of ashes-a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens, where ashes take the forms of houses and chimneys and rising smoke and finally, with a transcendent effort, of men who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air.... But above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift endlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg. The eyes of Dr. T. J. Eckleburg are blue and gigantic-their retinas are one yard high. They look out of no face but, instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a nonexistent nose. (27) From an opening that locates the Valley in relation to at least one real place, Nick's description moves through mild personification into unconstrained animism. Not content with the subdued anthropomorphism of a road which "hastily joins the railroad..,. so as to shrink away" from the waste land, the narrative literalizes the landscape's previously figurative personality, endow- ing it with not merely the power to act like human beings, but the unqualified ability to become them.s While surveying this allusion-turned-landscape, the reader is instructed with almost hypnotic repetition: "You perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Dr. T. J. Eckleburg. The eyes of Dr. T. J. Eckleburg are blue." Described with the precision of a driver's license (eyes: blue; retinas: one yard high) and assigned a flatly declarative agency (They look out of no face), these eyes maintain their fantastically independent existence until at least the passage's end, when their impossible size and facelessness begin to resolve into a real- istic explanation: "Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them there to fatten his practice" (28). However, the extrapolated optician has left town by the time of the story's telling, and only his sign remains to "brood on over the solemn dumping ground"-an inscrutable spirit above a vast abyss of ashes which delivers forth men only by the most transcendent figural effort. With its referent dead or moved away, the billboard has become a floating signifier; disconnected from the author of its meaning, it lies open to infinite interpretation:</page><page sequence="9">Elegiac Narration in Gatsby 215 "God sees everything," repeated Wilson. "That's an advertisement," Michaelis assured him. (167) Like this oculist absconditus who is simultaneously the advertisement's ref- erent and its creator, Nick is both subject and author of a signifier which must exist without his being there to guarantee its significance (i.e., that Gatsby turned out all right at the end). From this perspective, Nick's first- person narration might be understood as an attempt to put some semblance of authorial presence behind his sign. Gatsby's Bodily Double: Myrtle Wilson's Graphic Realism The cable-cutting fantasy of the Valley, however, is brought sharply down to earth by Tom Buchanan's mistress, whose vivid "incarnation" brings into the novel an insistent facticity dynamically opposed to Gatsby's unutterable visions. From the moment of her descent from the rooms which Nick imag- ines as "sumptuous and romantic apartments . . . concealed overhead," Myrtle's "thickish figure" "block[s] out the light" in "the shadow of a ga- rage." "[W]alking through her husband as if he were a ghost," Myrtle smol- ders in the midst of an otherwise burnt-out landscape, the only presence in the Valley substantial enough to escape the overhanging veil of ashes (29- 30). Whereas our first sight of Gatsby tells us little more than what his pos- ture suggests to Nick's far-away perspective (a glimpse of arms stretched trembling toward a green light distant over dark water), Myrtle is immedi- ately given to us fully realized in all her bodily magnificence-"[carrying] her surplus flesh sensuously" in a "spotted dress of dark blue crepe-de-chine"; shaking hands, wetting her lips, commanding her husband and her lover. In sharpening this contrast, the novel sketches out the meanness of James Gatz's life only after it has shown us the grandeur of Gatsby's, while ensuring that the barren circumstances which drive Myrtle's ambition are the first thing we learn about her. Immediately defined by her context-her husband, sister and friends; her history; the way she decorates her house-Myrtle is bound into the physical world around her; Gatsby, on the other hand, is given to us "at large and unrelated" in a way that leaves him much freer to slip from the realistic and into the allegorical. Nonetheless, Myrtle's sharp sense of pur- pose draws her close to Gatsby; she too is a "[boat] against the current" (189). Balanced on the intensity of their common desire to escape their re-</page><page sequence="10">216 N T spective origins, the novel's motion might be figured as a rocking back-and- forth between the concrete realism of Myrtle's story and the indefinite fan- tasy of Gatsby's. From Myrtle's perspective deep in the ashes of the wasteland, Tom Buchanan represents the possibility of escape, the power to acquire all the goods on "the list of things [she's] got to get. A massage and a wave and a collar for the dog and one of those cute little ash trays where you touch a spring, and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother's grave that'll last all summer" (41). The most precisely described location in the novel, all the rooms in Myrtle's apartment are small, and her living room is "crowded to the doors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too large for it so that to move about was to stumble continually over scenes of ladies swinging in the gardens of Versailles" (33).9 Filled with the kind of "realistic" detail other- wise absent from Nick's descriptions-an "over-enlarged photograph, ap- parently [of] a hen sitting on a blurred rock," "old copies of 'Town Tattle'" lying on the table, Catherine's "solid sticky bob of red hair," "the remains of the spot of dried lather" adhering to Mr. McKee's cheek, a dog biscuit "decompos[ing] apathetically in [a] saucer of milk"-Myrtle's apartment, unlike every other setting in the story, is rendered with a graphic specificity a set designer could accurately reproduce (33, 34, 41). Speech, too, gains an almost physical presence at Myrtle's party. Whereas the ineffable thrill of Daisy's voice leaves behind both words and the world to which they might refer ("I had to follow the sound of [Daisy's voice] for a moment, up and down, with my ear alone before any words came through"), Myrtle's speech bears her body with it: "Myrtle pulled her chair close to mine and suddenly her warm breath poured over me" (90, 40). At the same time, conversation undergoes a similar incarnation, sinking from the ethe- real brilliance of Daisy and Jordan's intricate banter to the dull vulgarity of Myrtle's ultra-mundane exchange with her sister and Mrs. McKee: "I had a woman up here last week to look at my feet and when she gave me the bill you'd of thought she had my appendicitus [sic] out." "What was the name of the woman?" asked Mrs. McKee. "Mrs. Eberhardt. She goes around looking at people's feet in their own homes."</page><page sequence="11">Elegiac Narration in Gatsby 217 "I like your dress," remarked Mrs. McKee. "I think it's adorable." (35) So insipid that it soon prompts Tom to yawn "audibly," dialogue in Myrtle's apartment moves gracelessly between clumsy speakers and subjects whose indelicacy (bills, appendicitus, feet) and discontinuity (Mrs. McKee's com- pletely off-topic remark about Myrtle's dress) would never be allowed in to East Egg's elegantly choreographed repartee (36). This mood of overcrowding and crudeness grows stronger as Nick gets drunker and Myrtle takes up more and more of the space in her apartment: "Her laughter, her gestures, her assertions became more violently affected moment by moment and as she expanded the room grew smaller around her until she seemed to be revolving on a noisy, creaking pivot through the smoky air" (35). At Myrtle's party, the gears show; the splendor which momentarily vanishes from Gatsby's face to reveal "an elegant young rough-neck whose elaborate formality of speech almost missed being absurd" lies be- yond the reach of Myrtle's violent affectations (53). In that strictly tangible world she dominates by the magnificence of her body and the intensity of her desire, Myrtle can accomplish no more than a physical expansion. Nor does Nick's narration in any way assist Myrtle's transcendence: if it is relatively easy to visualize the balloon to which Daisy and Jordan's couch is compared, it's not at all clear what kind of thing Myrtle is supposed to look like as she spins on her pivot.10 Still bound to the earth, Myrtle's metaphor fails to achieve the independent intelligibility that distinguishes more viable analogies; the "incoherent failure" of Nick's image draws our attention to the distance between Myrtle's material condition and the possibilities for romance which exist beyond it (188). Lacking Gatsby's theatrical ability to make something spectacular of himself and his world-to transform the fun- damental terms of his reality and thereby elude the limits they impose- Myrtle swells to enormous proportions without ever becoming larger-than- life. Through Nick's deepening haze, Myrtle's party grows increasingly more incomprehensible: Sitting on Tom's lap Mrs. Wilson called up several people on the telephone; then there were no cigarettes and I went out to buy some at the drug store on the corner. When I came back they had disappeared so I sat down discreetly in the living</page><page sequence="12">218 J N T room and read a chapter of "Simon Called Peter"--either it was terrible stuff or the whiskey distorted things because it didn't make any sense to me. (33-34) Joined by transitions that obscure causation (then there were no cigarettes; and I went out; when I came back), events seem strangely unrelated; A fol- lows B for no apparent reason. The tenor of the scene soon swings out of the confused and into the chaotic: "People disappeared, reappeared, made plans to go somewhere, and then lost each other, searched for each other, found each other a few feet away" (41). Then Tom breaks Myrtle's nose and Nick leaves a tableau dominated by a "despairing figure on the couch bleeding fluently" and trying to spread a copy of 'Town Tattle' over the tapestry scenes of Versailles" (42). Compelled by Tom to attend Myrtle's party and to abandon an "almost pastoral" vision of the city (complete with the promise of "a great flock of white sheep" waiting around the corner) Nick proves equally unable to ex- cuse himself once he's there (32). "[C]alled... back into the room" by the "shrill voice of Mrs. McKee," Nick is denied escape to a sky he imagines as "the blue honey of the Mediterranean" and is drawn again into the fiercely mundane web of Myrtle's parlor (38). Nick would rather be somewhere else: I wanted to get out and walk eastward toward the park through the soft twilight but each time I tried to go I became entangled in some wild strident argument which pulled me back, as if with ropes, into my chair. Yet high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening streets, and I was him too, looking up and wondering. I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inex- haustible variety of life. (40) If not simply repelled by what is happening at Myrtle's party, Nick is at- tracted to the life around him only when imagining his distance from it. For Nick, the furious confusion of Myrtle's party represents a concerted effort to force him to "play a part" in the too-real drama surrounding him (39). As such, it frustrates his attempts to gain the distance a reader-or an author- needs in order to give significant shape to "the inexhaustible variety of life."</page><page sequence="13">Elegiac Narration in Gatsby 219 Trimalchio's Banquet: A World Complete in Itself Whereas the chaos of Myrtle's party leaves Nick "entangled" in mun- dane detail, Gatsby's party offers what Henry James calls an "experience disengaged, disembroiled, disencumbered, [and] exempt from the condi- tions that we usually know to attach to it." The detachment Nick discovers in his hero-"no one swooned backward on Gatsby and no French bob touched Gatsby's shoulder and no singing quartets were formed with Gatsby's head for one link"-is the same isolation which makes possible his party's almost allusive poise: "In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the stars" (55, 43). Yet, in order for Gatsby's party to happen around Nick-the-character, Nick-the-narrator needs to make it happen. In order for his elegiac ambitions to succeed, Nick must conjure our assent to a "world complete in itself' (110). If Gatsby's party-assembled every fortnight by "a corps of caterers" out of "canvas" and "colored lights"-resembles nothing so much as a the- ater set, Nick is simultaneously the most enthusiastic member of its audi- ence and the stage manager responsible for making sure that nobody won- ders about the missing fourth wall (44, 43). In order to achieve Gatsby's Belasco-like "triumph" and make credible his magnificent fakery, Nick's narration must work as hard as the caterers and the gardeners put together (50): Every Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a fruiterer in New York-every Monday these same oranges and lemons left his back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves. There was a machine in the kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in half an hour, if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a butler's thumb. (43-44) The butler doesn't press the button; the button is pressed by a butler's thumb: like the magician's other hand, Nick's rhetorical figure diverts our attention from everything about the butler not included in his representative part. This seemingly explicit account of the origins of the juice consumed at Gatsby's party obscures entirely the agency of those responsible for making the fruit arrive as oranges and lemons and leave as empty peels. The button is pressed and unseen mechanisms move and marvelous things happen for no reason we can see; by hiding the connection between effects and their</page><page sequence="14">220 J N T causes, Nick's recurrent use of synecdoche casts over Gatsby's party the spell of inexplicability. Like a bouncer checking invitations, this exclusive trope keeps out of the party everything that distracts from its essential riot: "A tray of cocktails floated at us through the twilight and we sat down at a table with the two girls in yellow and three men, each one introduced to us as Mr. Mumble" (47). Disconnected from any person carrying them, the drinks can appear without reminding us of the waiter who will walk offstage and into a life of his own as soon as the curtain falls. In the same way, Nick almost entirely obscures the other guests at the table-eliminating all those features that play no part in the effect he's creating-to leave as synecdochical distillates their single aspect of color (the two girls in yellow) or peculiarity of speech (Mr Mumble).12 Reigning over West Egg is a sense of unreality, a strangeness of tone partially accomplished by the sudden shift of tense by means of which Nick drives his story into the present. After a paragraph which details the prepara- tions for Gatsby's party, Nick swerves without warning into the present per- fect: "By seven o'clock the orchestra has arrived," he tells us, without any explanation of how the band-or the narrative-got there (44). Gatsby's party is filled with things which seem to exist only in the present: The last swimmers have come in from the beach now and are dressing upstairs; the cars from New York are parked five deep in the drive, and already the halls and salons and verandas are gaudy with primary colors and hair shorn in strange new ways and shawls beyond the dreams of Castille. (44) Paratactically arranged to emphasize the simultaneity of its parts, this parade of phenomena leaves no tracks which might lead back to the past from which it came. Everything at Gatsby's party "already" is without any explanation of how it got to be that way. There is no chain of causes leading out from the "now" and into an historical background; this is a world of effects only, "a thing that merely happened" for no apparent reason: "People were not in- vited-they went there. They got into automobiles which bore them out to Long Island and somehow they ended up at Gatsby's door" (78, 45). Alone among a crowd of guests perfectly uninterested in even the immediate past- who "accepted Gatsby's hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute of know- ing nothing whatever about him"-only the guest called Owl Eyes cares</page><page sequence="15">Elegiac Narration in Gatsby 221 about origins and causes: "Who brought you," he asks Nick and Jordan, " ... Or did you just come? I was brought. Most people were brought" (65, 50). As we learn later at Gatsby's funeral, Owl Eyes is also the only one besides Nick who cares about Gatsby; in this respect there seems to be a connection between the skeptical fascination and the compassion both he and Nick feel for Gatsby. Unmarked by the conditions of its creation, Gatsby's party springs "from [its] Platonic conception"; like the "city... all built with a wish out of non- olfactory money," Nick's magnificent fabrication floats free from any trace of the smell of sweat (or worse) involved in its construction (104, 73). In this respect, the accomplishment of Gatsby's party exemplifies what Henry James describes as the essential artistic act: "Really, universally, relations stop nowhere, and the exquisite problem of the artist is eternally but to draw, by a geometry of his own, the circle within which they shall happily appear to do so."'3 The Rock of the World and the Fairy's Wing: Escape versus Transformation No such circle exists around Myrtle's party to obscure its relations to the rest of the world. Whereas Gatsby's revelry transfigures the materials of real life into theater, Myrtle's small rooms are dominated by a strictly repre- sentative photography, by pictures whose titles (e.g., "Montauk Point-the Gulls" and "Montauk Point-the Sea") suggest a perfectly literal treatment of their subjects. Indeed, Tom's parody of McKee's style of titling-"George B. Wilson at the Gasoline Pump"-sounds like nothing so much as a news- paper caption (37). Although the guests at Myrtle's party talk a lot about how Mr. McKee might "make something of" his subject matter, he seems largely uninterested in a kind of art that would significantly transform his materials (36). Nick hints at the poverty of McKee's creativity in the simile by which he describes him: "Mr. McKee was asleep on a chair with his fists clenched in his lap, like a photograph of a man of action" (41). In the same way that McKee can become a photograph just by coming to rest, he can make one by simply holding his subject still. As Robert Emmet Long puts it: "If the role of the artist is to achieve a vision underlying the inchoate mate- rial of reality, McKee is an artist manqud, who records only surfaces. Of his wife..,. he has taken one hundred twenty-seven photographs, a figure that, in its exactness, emphasizes the hopeless literalness of his mind" (108-9).</page><page sequence="16">222 J N T One might add that the number of photos, by its magnitude, also emphasizes McKee's failure to isolate the essence of his subject in an interpretive por- trait. Unable to make artistic value out of the facts he's given, McKee is left trying to record the "inexhaustible variety" of his wife's changing appear- ance in a potentially infinite series of snapshots. That is to say: this photog- rapher lacks the aesthetic control which keeps an author from slipping into what Roland Barthes calls "a downward spiral into endless detail": [W]hen discourse is no longer guided and limited by the struc- tural imperatives of the story . . . there is nothing to tell the writer why he should stop descriptive details at one point rather than another: if it was not subject to aesthetic or rhetorical choice, any "seeing" would be inexhaustible by discourse; there would always be some corner, some detail, some nuance of location or colour to add. (14) Those artistic imperatives which inform Gatsby's party lose their power in a world dominated by indiscriminate "seeing." More than miles separate the chorus girl whose broken sobs smear her make-up into musical notes and Myrtle's sister Catherine, of whose eyebrows Nick says: "[they] had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more rakish angle but the efforts of nature toward the restoration of the old alignment gave a blurred air to her face" (56, 34). In Gatsby's universe, a driver can emerge from a crash not only unscathed but oblivious to the fact that he has shorn a wheel off his car (58-60). At Myrtle's party, where the conditions of nature can be blurred but never overcome, her very real blood will leave lasting stains on unmistak- able furniture. Embedded in a fiercely material condition, Myrtle has no reason to be- lieve in "the unreality of reality, [the] promise that the rock of the world [is] founded securely on a fairy's wing" (105). Like Nick, she knows that "you can't repeat the past" and recognizes more clearly than anything else that "you can't live forever" (116, 40). Unable to make a grail of her unmysterious lover, Myrtle is like Gatsby before he falls for Daisy, wanting no more than to "take what he could and go" (156). Because she cannot imagine changing the world in which she lives, Myrtle longs only to escape it for a better one. By contrast, Gatsby is uninterested in escape as such. The young James Gatz keeps no list of things he's got to get; in its place, he sketches into his copy of Hopalong Cassidy a schedule for self-transformation.</page><page sequence="17">Elegiac Narration in Gatsby 223 Making Gatsby Happen: The Tone of a Narrator's Voice Yet Gatsby is only partially responsible for filling out his Platonic con- ception of himself. The well-wrought creation of Nick's visionary longing, Gatsby is as much a man-made self as a self-made man. In order to become the "something gorgeous" the preface promises, Gatsby needs Nick to fill in the gaps and overlook the failures in his "unbroken series of successful ges- tures." For Gatsby to happen, Nick must write a greenhouse around his hero's delicate greatness and persuade both us and himself to believe in it. The obstacles Nick must surmount in order to accomplish our sense of Gatsby's gorgeousness become clearest at those moments when he fails to do so. We become sharply aware of the resistance overcome by Nick's most impressive act of cable-cutting-his rendering of the strange magnificence of Gatsby's party-when gravity reasserts itself so forcefully in Daisy's pres- ence: There were the same people..,. the same many-colored, many- keyed commotion, but I felt an unpleasantness in the air, a pervading harshness that hadn't been there before. Or per- haps I had merely grown used to it, grown to accept West Egg as a world complete in itself, with its own standards and its own great figures... and now I was looking at it again, through Daisy's eyes. (110) By focusing our attention on the incompleteness of Gatsby's world, Daisy's perspective reveals the limitations of those standards on which its radiance depends-the fragility of that environment in which this hero can happen. Daisy's presence at Gatsby's party exposes how ephemeral is that greatness he shares with the protagonist of Tender is the Night: "[T]o be included in Dick Diver's world for a while was a remarkable experience .... So long as [people] subscribed to it completely, their happiness was his preoccupation, but at the first flicker of doubt as to its all-inclusiveness he evaporated be- fore their eyes" (36). Looking back, one can see more clearly the effect of Nick's narration earlier in the novel, the part it plays in transforming the "many-keyed com- motion" of Gatsby's extravaganza into "something significant, elemental and profound" (51). In themselves, the events which close Gatsby's first party are horrible; yet, when translated through the tissue of Nick's perception,</page><page sequence="18">224 J N T they come across very differently: I looked around. Most of the remaining women were now having fights with men said to be their husbands. Even Jordan's party, the quartet from East Egg, were rent asunder by dissen- sion The reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward men. The hall was at present occupied by two deplorably so- ber men and their highly indignant wives In spite of the wives' agreement that [their husbands'] ma- levolence was beyond credibility the dispute ended in a short struggle and both wives were lifted kicking into the night. (56- 57) From an incongruous combination of modifiers (e.g., "deplorably sober men"), Nick's description rings through a scale of strikingly discordant lin- guistic registers: the elevation of "malevolence beyond credibility" abuts the journalistic straightforwardness of "the dispute ended in a short struggle" and finally sublimates off as the mock-lyrical "lifted kicking into the night." The facts themselves are brutal; only by ironizing them into playful inconse- quence can Nick write a scene of couples fighting into a proper finale to Gatsby's party. In another sense, there are no facts; wrapped round in the dense weave of his narrative voice, people and things disappear behind Nick's telling of them.14 The same voice is almost silent when Daisy visits Gatsby's party. Like a reporter trying simply to keep track of what he sees, Nick's narratorial role is limited to little more than transcribing directly quoted dialogue. As a result, Nick's power to inflect the events he presents is sharply restricted. A trans- parent narrator innocently bystanding, Nick does little to distract us from seeing that there's nothing funny in Daisy's offering Tom her "little gold pencil" to take down the address of another woman; the "genial" tone Nick hears in Daisy's voice is not his wry irony but her cutting sarcasm (112). At the same time, Daisy's cynical acceptance of Tom's flirtation adds an ugli- ness to his adultery that is less immediate when we see him alone with either Myrtle or Daisy. "I'd enjoyed these same people only two weeks before," Nick tells us. "But what had amused me then turned septic on the air now" (112). The narrative lends no redeeming sparkle to the only exchange we're</page><page sequence="19">Elegiac Narration in Gatsby 225 given between the party regulars: "Anything I hate is to get my head stuck in a pool," mumbled Miss Baedeker. "They almost drowned me once over in New Jersey." "Then you ought to leave it alone," countered Doctor Civet. "Speak for yourself!" cried Miss Baedeker violently. "Your hand shakes. I wouldn't let you operate on me!" (113) Though only talk, the dialogue in this scene suggests that having your head stuck in a pool could get you drowned, that the hilarious drunkenness of a doctor might matter in those operating rooms the talk makes real-in that world which lies beyond the edge of Gatsby's perfect lawn, that outside realm whose presence proves the incompleteness of Nick's fantastic one. How They Turn Out at the End: Deaths Physical and Metaphorical The air of menace which hangs over Daisy's visit precipitates violently in the scene of the car crash. Having escaped from the rooms in which she has been locked up by her husband, Myrtle runs out into the road, screaming back at George: "Beat me!" [Michaelis] heard [Myrtle] cry. "Throw me down and beat me, you dirty little coward!" A moment later she rushed out into the dusk, waving her hands and shouting; before he could move from his door the business was over. The "death car," as the newspapers called it, didn't stop; it came out of the gathering darkness, wavered tragically for a moment and then disappeared around the next bend .... The other car . . . came to rest a hundred yards beyond, and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson, her life violently extinguished, knelt in the road and mingled her thick, dark blood with the dust. Michaelis and this man reached her first but when they had torn open her shirtwaist still damp with perspiration they saw that her left breast was swinging loose like a flap and there was no need to listen for the heart beneath. The mouth</page><page sequence="20">226 J N T was wide open and ripped at the corners as though she had choked a little in giving up the tremendous vitality she had stored so long. (144-45) As the narrative veers away from Myrtle to Michaelis's view of her, the crash becomes "the business" and the moment of impact is hidden by a shift to the newspaper's even more distant perspective. When we next see Myrtle, it's not immediately clear what happened during the car's tragic wavering; the agency suggested by Myrtle's kneeling and mingling almost overwhelms our sense of her devastation-a fact which has been relegated to a phrase tangential to the line of force drawn from the subject to its predicate ("its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson, her life violently extinguished, knelt in the road and mingled her thick, dark blood with the dust"). If left at all confused, however, we are quickly set straight by the next paragraph's brutally direct statement. From the mechanical image of Myrtle's breast "swinging loose like a flap," Michaelis's sweep of vision brings us to "the heart" and "[t]he mouth": impersonal parts that have nothing to do with the woman until now defined by the sensuality with which she carried her "surplus flesh" (29). Only a slamming car could tear away that bodily life no dream could sustain, and once Myrtle is dead, there is absolutely nothing of her left. If Myrtle after the crash has little in common with Myrtle before it, Gatsby is barely changed by his murder; in this sense, Myrtle's is the only physical death in the novel. The "colossal vitality of his illusion" is inseparable from Gatsby's own vitality; the moment his dream proves impossible is the mo- ment of his own extinction (101). Gatsby's death as a character has nothing to do with the trigger George Wilson pulls; he fades out of the story long before his redundant executioner can accomplish his misguided justice. Sticks and Stones: Mundane Speech and Body Heat The day of Gatsby's doom is the kind when train tickets return stained by the sweat of the conductor's hand, when convertibles' seats leave their driv- ers wishing they'd parked in the shade, when even the butler glistens slightly. Through a noon like a teakettle boiling-"only the hot whistles of the Na- tional Biscuit Company broke the simmering hush" (120)-Nick returns to the scene of his history's beginning and enters the Buchanans' living room to</page><page sequence="21">Elegiac Narration in Gatsby 227 discover that everything has changed: chapter one The only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon. They were both in white and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house. (12) chapter seven Daisy and Jordan lay upon an enormous couch, like silver idols, weighing down their own white dresses against the sing- ing breeze of the fan. "We can't move," they said together. (122) The words Daisy didn't mean at all when she welcomed Nick in the first chapter-" 'I'm p-paralyzed with happiness' "-are here corroborated by the narrative's description (13). Flirt-talk has moved that much closer to fact; metaphor has deflated and fallen back to earth; the women who once floated through the room like balloons are now silver ballast unmoved by the breeze. At the same time, speech, which began the novel as the ephemeral fluff behind which the Real was obscured, has now gained an almost bodily pres- ence: " 'The thing to do is to forget about the heat,'" says Tom." 'You make it ten times worse by crabbing about it' "(133). Overwhelmed by the mate- riality of her immediate environment-what Italo Calvino calls "the weight, the inertia, the opacity of the world" (4)-Daisy's voice "struggle[s] on through the heat, beating against it, moulding its senselessness into forms" (125). The temperature weighs heavily on that cable-cutting banter which might otherwise have relieved the scene's oppressive mood: " 'It's so hot,' [Daisy] complained. 'You go. We'll ride around and meet you after.' With an effort her wit rose faintly, 'We'll meet you on some corner. I'll be the man smoking two cigarettes' "(132). In air so thick that "every extra gesture was an affront to the common store of life," not even the thrill of Daisy's casual fiction can raise conversation above that sensuous experience Nick recalls</page><page sequence="22">228 J N T most vividly, the "sharp physical memory that..,. my underwear kept climb- ing like a damp snake around my legs and intermittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back" (121, 132-33). No longer able to lift its audience away from the bodies of the novel's characters, language now clings tightly to them. Wanting "nothing less of Daisy than that she should go to her husband and say, 'I never loved you,' " Gatsby arranges a confrontation with Tom designed to set the stage for his return with Daisy to the life they left five years earlier (116). But Daisy refuses to play the role Gatsby has scripted for her, and our hero proves unable to "'fix everything just the way it was be- fore'" (117). Unwilling to say that she never loved her husband, to "[wipe] out" the three years of their marriage, Daisy leaves Gatsby facing Tom's triumphant insistence that" 'there're things between Daisy and me that you'll never know, things that neither of us can ever forget'" (139, 140). Against these "things"-the irrevocable history of a honeymoon in a particular place, the fact of a real daughter-Gatsby has no defense; his fantastic ambitions have run aground on the rock of the world. For Nick's hero, this is the mo- ment of the car's impact: Tom's unrefuted claims, the narrator tells us, "seemed to bite physically into Gatsby," and later we learn that " 'Jay Gatsby' had broken up like glass against Tom's hard malice" (140, 155). "Jay Gatsby"- the perfect achievement of James Gatz's carefully scheduled metamorpho- sis-exists no longer; the man who filled the contours of the name he in- vented for himself has been translated by Tom into "Mr. Nobody from No- where" (137). The destruction of his defining dream nearly complete, there is not much more of Gatsby's story left to tell. From his first sight of an indistinct neigh- bor with arms stretched toward a distant green light, Nick has been brought to a vision of Gatsby waiting on Daisy's lawn to make sure she'll be all right, the "sacredness of [his] vigil" reduced to a "watching over nothing" (153). Nick's description of Gatsby's death feels almost like an epilogue: There was a faint, barely perceptible movement of the water as the fresh flow from one end urged its way toward the drain at the other. With little ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves, the laden mattress moved irregularly down the pool. A small gust of wind that scarcely corrugated the surface was enough to disturb its accidental course with its accidental bur- den. The touch of a cluster of leaves revolved it slowly, trac-</page><page sequence="23">Elegiac Narration in Gatsby 229 ing, like the leg of a compass, a thin red circle in the water. It was after we started with Gatsby toward the house that the gardener saw Wilson's body a little way off in the grass, and the holocaust was complete. (97, 170) In a world where motion and matter have been reduced to an absolute mini- mum and action has been emptied of intent, there is no mention of the corpse Nick has discovered. The mass that warps the mattress lacks the weight to keep its course against the most qualified of currents (so scarce it hardly shadows waves); in the absence of all desire, this ghostly bier spins slowly at the touch of leaves. As its hero fades and the novel's exhausted plot winds down, the history of Nick's attempt to author a purely creative work rises to a climax. In his account of Gatsby's last moments, Nick's narrative leaves behind the matter- of-fact and enters entirely into the metaphorical: where Myrtle's violent de- struction leaves behind a thing out of which her personality has been brutally ripped, all that remains of the man that was Gatsby is a red circle drawn across troubled water. What's left of Gatsby the hero transcends not only the fact of his body but the limitations of physical law altogether: in the real world, the shot that killed a man floating on an air mattress would likely puncture the raft and leave him lying at the bottom of the pool. By his cable- cutting account of Gatsby's death, Nick sets him spinning impossibly through a world disengaged from what we know of how things work-into the only world in which even Gatsby could happen and turn out all right at the end. Cornell University Ithaca, New York Notes 1. James 33-34; Fitzgerald, Life 67. 2. In this respect, Nick experiences what Mikhail Bakhtin describes as a "full dialogization of consciousness" in which "[t]he other's discourse..,. penetrates the consciousness and speech of the hero" in forms which "would not be appropriate in monologically confi- dent speech" (222). 3. In so doing, Nick designs a narrative like one of Kermode's "end-determined fictions": "Men, like poets, rush 'into the middest,' in media res, when they are born; they also die</page><page sequence="24">230 1 N T in mediis rebus, and to make sense of their span they need fictive concords with origins and ends, such as give meaning to lives and to poems" (6, 7). 4. This parenthetical space within which speakers ask their listeners to visualize a non- existent comparison (as Nick asks us to imagine a woman balancing an object on her chin) might function like the "asides" in a play. Both rhetorical forms create a space outside the ordinary channels of communication from which characters can speak more directly to their audiences. 5. Nick's surrounding description might reinforce our sense of the rightness of this "world elsewhere": "Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western Hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound" (9). By hinting at a likeness between "domesticated" inlets and chickens laying eggs for farm- ers, Nick's unusual choice of words might suggest that both these natural bodies are redefined by the "courtesy" they show toward human beings. 6. To Harvey's acute analysis of how these two images create a "double exposure," I would add that the apparently onomatopoeic description of Tom closing the windows-"Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the rear windows"-serves not only as the sound of the windows slamming, but as a ship's "boom" as well, thereby closing the collocation of metaphors (95). There are other moments in Gatsby when Fitzgerald cre- ates a context that brings out the homonymic potential of words; see, for example, the description which distinguishes Myrtle from the ashes that surround her: "She smiled slowly and walking through her husband as if he were a ghost shook hands with Tom, looking himflush in the eye. Then she wet her lips" (my emphasis, 30). 7. "For example," Carter continues, " 'busy' [and] 'buzz' have a high probability of co- occurrence with 'bee'; bee in turn regularly co-occurs with words such as 'hive' or 'honey' and less regularly with items such as 'intrepid' or 'transmogrifying' "(159). 8. It's worth noticing the resemblance between the paratactic sentences through which the ashes transmute themselves into people and those syntactic hurdles over which the Buchanans' lawn must leap in its race toward their house: The lawn started at the beach and ran toward the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over sun-dials and brick walks and burn- ing gardens-finally, when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run. (11) *c *c *</page><page sequence="25">Elegiac Narration in Gatsby 231 where ashes take the forms of houses and chimneys and rising smoke and finally, with a transcendent effort, of men who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air. The parallel sentence shapes shared by these animate terrains might suggest an unlikely consonance between East Egg and the Valley of Ashes. In the basic insincerity behind Daisy's thrilling smiles, the dimly remembered scandal associated with Jordan's sar- donic charm, and the cruelty implicit in Tom's lever-like body, there might be ashes already. Within worlds more or less explicitly burnt out, where people lack those dream- ing ambitions which could give form to their restlessness, agency diffuses into land- scapes which run and leap and shape themselves. 9. The same images of opulence with which Myrtle can only cover her furniture, serve as the models by which Gatsby builds his dream into concrete being; her ungainly aspira- tions to "scenes . . . of Versailles" are his actual "Marie Antoinette music rooms and Restoration salons" (96). 10. As Podis puts it: "The vehicle used to metaphorize Myrtle... comes with no definite presuppositions attached to it, since it has no prior existence in language" (65). 11. Drawn by material ambitions into a relationship that is "just personal," Myrtle expresses herself most articulately in "body-language"; she is rendered "fluent" only by the flow of her blood. Without the narrator on her side to obscure her too-sensual contours, Myrtle lacks the means to tell a story in which she turns out all right at the end. Because she has no one to speak her unutterable visions for her, Myrtle proves finally as perishable as her flesh. 12. For a different approach to Fitzgerald's use of this trope, see Hilton Anderson's discus- sion of "Synecdoche in The Great Gatsby." Basically, Anderson argues that Fitzgerald represents Gatsby by his smile and Daisy by her voice in order to delay his readers' discovery of these characters' more distasteful qualities. 13. Preface to Roderick Hudson (5). 14. Fitzgerald recognizes the power of this kind of obscuration in his explanation of the "tremendous fault" constituted by the novel's lack of"an emotional presentment of Daisy's attitude toward Gatsby after their reunion (and the consequent lack of logic or impor- tance in her throwing him over)": "Everyone has felt this but no one has spotted it be- cause its [sic] concealed beneath elaborate and overlapping blankets of prose" (Letter to H.
