<plain_text><page sequence="1">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 419 JOURNALS AND NEW BOOKS REVUE PHILOSOPHIQUE. January, 1917. Eknergie et Force (pp. 2-36): F. LE DANTEC. - "Force" is a verbal fiction and science should free itself from the use of the term. The concept of force is a hybrid relic of anthropomorphism, and the employment of such a term forces science to enunciate its discoveries in a language which affirms the contrary of that which it is intended to recount. Sur quelques formes de nos efforts (pp. 37-59) : DR. JEAN PHILIPPE. -Whatever the degree and form of effort, effort consists in a de- ployment of an energy that is spontaneous, because it is nascent, and intelligent because perfectly applied by previous experience; it is opposed to the automatism of our habits and conforms to our personal initiative. De quelques espe'ces de liberte's et de quelques- unes de leurs conditions (pp. 60-89): ADRIEN NAvIL. - Contends that liberty of execution, of action, must be distinguished from " free will. " Distinguishes " psychical liberty, " " physical liberty, " and "social liberty" as forms of liberty of execution, and insists that "psychical liberty" should not be confounded with freedom of the will.
