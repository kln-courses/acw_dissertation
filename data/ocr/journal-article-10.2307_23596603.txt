<plain_text><page sequence="1">Cambridge Journal of Economies, 1981, 5, 119-135 A conceptual analysis of a non-capitalist gift economy with particular reference to Papua New Guinea C. A. Gregory* 1. Introduction The aim of this paper is to develop a conceptual framework for the analysis of non capitalist economies of the type found in Papua New Guinea (PNG). This framework is firstly used to develop the concept of a 'gift economy' and secondly used to establish the necessary conditions for the self-replacement of the society of which it constitutes a part. In previous studies, the indigenous socio-economic system of Papua New Guinea has been classified as 'primitive communist', 'primitive capitalist' (Epstein, 1968), 'primitive affluence' (Fisk, 1966), 'stone age' (Sahlins, 1972) and 'tribal'. As such a variety in approach suggests, the object of investigation has at best been under stood only partially, with studies rarely proceeding beyond the level of selective descrip tion. This paper attempts to establish certain conceptual foundations for a more analytical approach to the problem. In particular, its goal is to contribute to the understanding of a gift economy by using a modified version of the concept of self replacement used by Lévi-Strauss to develop that used by Marx and Sraffa. For although the latter was developed with the particular case of European capitalism in mind, it can be modified to apply to the PNG case. The particular theoretical problem posed by the descriptive anthropological data on the indigenous economy of PNG concerns the relations established by the circulation (exchange) of things. At one level, the latter appears to follow the same rules as those in a capitalist economy—hence Epstein's characterisation of the system as 'primitive capitalism'. However, as is argued below, such an approach is misleading. For whereas the relations of circulation in a capitalist economy are to be explained with reference to the methods of 'productive consumption' (the reproduction of things), in a gift economy they must be explained with reference to the methods of 'consumptive pro duction' (reproduction of people). The framework used to demonstrate this proposition is based on the assumption that the system is in a self-replacing state. This assumption, which is made in order to focus on certain key relationships in the gift economy, involves abstracting from many features which may be important at a given point in time, * Clare Hall, Cambridge. The author would like to thank Maurice Godelier and Geoff Harcourt for helpful comments on an earlier draft of this paper. He is particularly grateful for constructive advice from the editors of the Cambridge Journal of Economics in the writing of the final draft. 0309—166X/81/020119-|-17 $02.00/0 © 1981 Academic Press Inc.

In this respect the methodology adopted is similar to that used by Sraffa in his analysis of self-replacement in a commodity economy. The paper is arranged as follows. Section 2 provides a brief account of the historical context of the problem. Section 3 develops the conceptual framework of analysis. This starts from Marx's distinction between 'productive consumption' and 'consumptive production' and tries to develop the latter by considering sexual reproduction and the circulation of people. Section 4 discusses the problem of the definition of particular economies and briefly describes the socia) data presupposed in an analysis of a gift economy. Section 5 considers the social relations of exchange that are created in a gift economy and contrasts these with the relations of commodity exchange. Section 6 attempts to explain this difference with reference to the particular way in which social groups—and hence the people who belong to them—are reproduced in a gift economy. While the argument implicitly entails a critique of the neoclassical approach to the analysis of non-capitalist economies this is not explicitly pursued in this paper: given the space constraint it seemed more important to set out a constructive alternative. 2. Background notes on PNG Papua was first colonised by the British in 1884 and New Guinea by the Germans in the same year. After the First World War both colonies were administered by Australia until the country gained its independence in 1975. Rubber and copra plantations made use of the readily available cheap labour, and mining companies were established to exploit a number of raw materials. These companies, together with missionaries and the Australian government, brought about enormous changes in the indigenous way of life. However, they did not destroy indigenous economic forms completely. Indeed, many flourished and developed (Strathern, 1979). The basic data on the working of the indigenous economy come from the many volumes of anthropological literature on PNG. They stress the extreme diversity in the social organisation of the various tribes, an index of which is the fact that over 1000 different languages, representing one-fifth of the world's total, are spoken by the country's 2|-3 million people (Laycockand Wurm, 1974). However, a number of basic themes run through these studies. The basic unit of social organisation has been, and still is, the clan. This unit defines a group of people who own a well defined tract of land and among whom marriage is prohibited. Another feature of the political organisation of most of PNG's tribes is that hereditary chiefs do not exist. Leadership tends to be in the hands of 'big-men' who achieve status according to a 'meritocracy' system that involves the competitive giving of gifts. A big-man rises to the top by humiliating his opponent with his generosity. For example, if A gives B 100 pigs and B replies with a counter-gift of 120 pigs that A cannot repay, then B becomes a big-man. This system does not exist in all areas. In some places, leadership is in the hands of elders who acquire their position because of seniority. The clan is usually self-sufficient from the point of view of food production, and there is a division of labour by gender : women tend to do the everyday jobs such as planting, weeding, etc., and men tend to engage in other, more interesting forms of production and ceremonial activity. Today, most villagers grow cash crops for the world market and almost every village has a number of people who are away, or have been away, working in towns or on plantations. Thus the present system of economic organisation is an extremely complex mixture of both indigenous and imposed forms.</page><page sequence="3">Analysis of non-capitalist gift economy 121 3. A conceptual framework While the Marxian conceptual framework is appropriate for analysing certain aspects of European societies, it requires some modification before it can be transferred to non European ones such as Papua New Guinea. In the latter, marriage—a human relation ship not explicitly discussed by Marx—is of crucial economic importance. This omission could simply be tackled by developing a synthesis of Marx's concept of reproduction with that of Lévi-Strauss. However, such a synthesis would itself not be adequate, since certain important conceptual problems still would persist. Thus, after pinpointing these, an attempt is made below to develop a modified synthesis which is appropriate for a type of society such as Papua New Guinea. Marx's model of reproduction in general is outlined in the 'Introduction' to Grundrisse. In this essay, Marx examined the general relations of material production, i.e., the general relations of the production of things and people. He began by criticising the 'bourgeois' economists' conception of material production. He attacked them for having an independent Natural Individual as the point of departure: The individual and isolated hunter and fisherman, with whom Smith and Ricardo begin, belongs among the unimaginative conceits of the eighteenth-century Robinsonades (Marx, 1973, p. 83). He also criticised them for conceiving of the spheres of production, consumption, distribution and circulation as 'independent, autonomous neighbours' (Marx, 1973, p. 88) and for analysing the relations between them in terms of a one-way avenue that has production as the point of departure, consumption as the conclusion, distribution and exchange as the middle. Marx argued that production, consumption, distribution and circulation must be grasped as members of a totality, distinctions within a unity (Marx, 1973, p. 100), with production as the predominant moment (Marx, 1973, p. 94). He pointed out that production is also immediately consumption (Marx, 1973, p. 90), because it necessarily involves the using up of materials and labour energies. This process he called productive consumption. But consumption is also immediately production, he argued. It is clear that in taking in food, which is a form of consumption, human beings produce their own bodies; in other words, the consumption of things is a necessary condition for the production of human beings. This process he called consumptive production. In this analysis, distribution and circulation 'step between' production and consumption, and their structure is completely determined by pro duction. But distribution is important because it defines particular forms of production. This comes about because distribution has a twofold character: it is (1) the distribution of products, and (2) the distribution of the instruments of production. In Marx's view the latter defines historical forms of production. If it is to be regarded at a general level, there are two problems with Marx's account of reproduction as a whole. The first concerns the incompleteness of his notion of con sumptive production. Marx discussed the need for people to be nourished, but not the biological character of reproduction, i.e., sexual relationships and parenthood. This omission led him to develop a one-dimensional concept of circulation, focused on things, rather than a two-dimensional one which also brings in the way in which people circulate. Naturally, this simultaneously led to the second general problem, i.e., the extent to which it is legitimate as a general proposition to argue that the process of productive consumption is the predominant sphere in all societies. These two problems, however, essentially derive from the attempt to develop a</page><page sequence="4">122 C. A. Gregory conceptual framework appropriate for analysing certain kinds of non-capitalist econom ies, and from the related attempt to abstract, at a general level, an overall framework which can be made specific for a wider range of societies than the capitalist ones with which Marx was concerned. Indeed, Marx's treatment of biological reproduction as an exogenous element may well have been appropriate given the historical conditions of his time and the particular historical characteristics of the type of society which he was analysing. A natural point of departure for further exploring the notion of consumptive pro duction is the work of Lévi-Strauss. He regarded circulation not only as autonomous, but also as predominant in a wide range of spheres. He argued, for example, that language, kinship and economics are three forms of circulation : The rules of kinship and marriage serve to ensure the circulation of women between groups, just as economic rules serve to ensure the circulation of goods and services, and linguistic rules the circulation of messages (Lévi-Strauss, 1968, p. 83). With this focus, he developed an element that was missing from Marx's account of reproduction: the process of circulation involving people. He did this by treating marriage as a form of circulation of women. But, while sex is a necessary precondition for the reproduction of people, marriage is not. Lévi-Strauss, as Leach (1970, p. 103) has pointed out, confused sex and marriage. Sex is the general category, not marriage. Marriage is a particular social form whose historical occurrence has to be described and explained. However, while treating marriage as synonymous with the way in which people circulate to produce a new generation of people is illegitimate in general, this does not imply that there may not be particular societies in which it is a valid analytical procedure. PNG is such a case because marriage usually involves the spatial circulation of women between clans. This circulation of women tends not only to be permanent, but also is predominantly oriented to the reproduction and upbringing of children. It is more like the transactions involving slaves than transactions involving wage labourers in that stocks of people, rather than merely flows of labour-time, are involved. In PNG, the 'flows'—productive labour-time, 'domestic' labour-time, and reproductive services—are embodied in the 'stock' that is transacted at marriage. The principal conclusions that emerge from this brief discussion of Marx and Lévi Strauss can be summarised as follows: (1) the production, consumption, distribution and circulation of things and people are elements of a totality, not autonomous spheres; (2) neither the way in which things are produced nor the way in which people circulate is necessarily the 'predominant phase' because the question of predominance is empirical rather than conceptual1; (3) productive consumption is a reification process that con verts people's labour energies into things while consumptive production is a personifi cation process that permits the survival of people, firstly through the provision of their nourishment, and secondly through their sexual relationships; and (4) particular historical processes of reproduction are defined only by examining the appropriate historical evidence on the social relations which exist in given societies. This latter point is taken up in the next section. 1 Maurice Godelier (personal communication) argues that production is the predominant phase because, since its beginning, mankind has changed its material relationship with nature moving from hunting gathering economic systems to various forms of agriculture and animal husbandry while the material aspect of kinship has not changed since homo sapiens appeared. In the contemporary PNG situation, which is the concern of this essay, capitalist production is unambiguously the 'predominant phase'.</page><page sequence="5">Analysis of non-capitalist gift economy 123 4. The definition of particular economies If the historical and anthropological record is examined a bewildering array of data relating to the distribution of the means of production is to be found. Fortunately, Marx and Engels (1848) and Morgan (1877) developed a simplified typology for classifying this evidence. Marx was concerned with the classification of the different forms of class society that existed at various stages in the history of Europe, while Morgan was concerned with the classification of the different forms of clan society that existed in contemporary (nineteenth century) non-European society. A synthesis of their approaches yields the following taxonomy: (1) clan-based societies (a) dual-clan (b) phratry (c) tribe (d) nation (e) confederacy (2) class-based societies (f) slavery (g) serfdom (labour-rent societies) (h) produce-rent societies (i) proletariat/capitalist societies. Until the emergence of European capitalism, land was the most important means of production. Indeed, most of the above list can be considered as an answer to the question: 'How is land distributed between groups of people?' The answers 'equally' and 'unequally' provide the initial basis for the classification into 'clans' and 'classes'. An alternative way of describing this broad opposition is to pose the question : 'What is the relation of the producer to the means of production?' Whether or not it is one of alienation once again indicates 'class' and 'clan' respectively. This rigid bipolar oppo sition requires modification by introducing the subgroup classification. The latter can be considered as points on a continuum: at one end the land is distributed evenly among the groups that make up the society (dual-clan) at the other end one group possesses all the land and other means of production (capitalist) and the other group is landless (proletariat) and has to sell its labour-power to the former. Whereas the subgroups within the category 'class' are well known, and are discussed in detail in historical perspective by Marx (1867, Part VIII), the subgroups within the category 'clan' are less familiar. A clan has many defining characteristics (Morgan, 1877, pp. 292-293). However, for the purposes of this analysis the two most important are, firstly, the obligation of a member of a clan not to marry within his or her clan, and, secondly, the possession of land in common. The simplest form of clan organisation is the 'dual-clan' whereby the population is divided into two groups, A and B, and where the land available for exploitation is more or less equally divided. The other types of clan organisation are built on this basic structure : a phratry is two sets of dual-clans, a tribe a collection of phratries, a nation a collection of tribes and a confederacy a collection of nations. Although, as with the 'class' categories, these 'clan' categories are simplifications, they both enable many societies to be classified according to fairly simple criteria and serve as a starting point for the development of a more elaborate typology. These different types of clan organisation have tended to be associated with different types of political leadership. For example, studies in Papua New Guinea have identified both phratries</page><page sequence="6">124 C. A. Gregory and tribes and found that these tend to be associated with 'elders' and 'big-men' respectively; studies on Africa have identified nations and tribes which tend, respectively, to be associated with chiefs and kings. The recent anthropological evidence from PNG illustrates that while some alienation of land has occurred (e.g., Finney, 1973, p. 112) the clan has retained some importance as a social group in rural areas. Land maps that some anthropologists have produced clearly show the tendency for 'equality' in the distribution of land between clans; also linguistic evidence illustrates the concept of 'unity' between producers and their land. For example, in the Mt Hagen district of the New Guinea highlands, clan names have the suffix -mbo attached to the name of the clan's founder. This term means the shoot from something planted and thus a group of people do not constitute a clan unless they have 'roots' in the land upon which they live (Strathern, A. J., 1972, pp. 42-43). The task now is to investigate the consequences of social relations of type (b), (c) and (i) for the definition of particular types of reproduction. 5. Exchange relations in a gift economy Exchange in general has the form x A &gt; B where A and B are transactors and x and y are the objects of exchange. The transactors can be individuals or groups and the objects can be either things or labour services. When A and B are classes the social form of the exchange of labour-services will be very different from the case when A and B are clans. However, before this distinction is pursued, consider the case where x andjy are things. In class-based societies things tend to assume a commodity-form whereas in clan based societies they tend to assume a gift-form. This distinction between gifts and commodities is best grasped by contrasting the different relations of exchange which they establish. When the objects of an exchange are commodities the exchange relations are estab lished between the objects. Exchanges of this sort presuppose, as Marx was first to show (Marx, 1867, p. 91), that the transactors are in a state of reciprocal independence and the objects alienable. But when the objects of an exchange are gifts the exchange relations are established between the transactors. Exchanges of this type presuppose that the transactors are in a state of reciprocal dependence and that the objects are inalienable (see Mauss, 1925). The meaning of this distinction ultimately must be sought in the particular social character of the labour that produces commodities and of the people who make gifts. The alienable character of commodities finds its expression in what Marx called 'fetishism'. There is a definite social relation between men, that assumes, in their eyes, the fantastic form of a relation between things (Marx, 1867, p. 77). The meaning of this concept has puzzled many. But, as Marx pointed out, the 'whole mystery of commodities . . . vanishes ... so soon as we come to other forms of production' (Marx, 1867, pp. 80-81), i.e., when the capitalist commodity economy is contrasted with non-capitalist ones such as the gift economy of Papua New Guinea.</page><page sequence="7">Analysis of non-capitalist gift economy 125 'Fetishism', as Marx used the term, is a synonym for 'reification'—the mental conver sion of a person into a thing—and its opposite is personification (or anthropomorphism)— the mental conversion of a thing into a person. Alienation and reification are associated in the same way as are inalienation and personification. The gift-economy literature provides extensive evidence about the latter. In the highlands of PNG pigs are important objects of gift exchange and the people actually regard them almost in the same way as they regard people (Modjeska, 1977, p. 92). In the coastal areas, yams are the principal means of subsistence and these are regarded as human beings in metamorphosised form ; indeed, legends exist explaining how yams originated by metamorphosis from humans (Fortune, 1932, p. 95). Personification is not restricted to food. Gawa Island, for example, specialises in the production and exchange of canoes, but these are produced and exchanged as gifts, not commodities. Even though the clan that produced a canoe may never see it again, the canoe is never regarded as alienated from the clan and the forms delineated on its prow-boards will be anthropomorphised (Munn, 1977). Inalienability and personification characterise all gift economies, not just the one in Papua New Guinea. Among the Kachin of Upper Burma, for example, objects given as gifts have the social property of inalienability. Consider Leach's description of an exchange transaction: The best way to acquire notoriety as the owner (ruler) of an object is publicly to give possession of it to someone else. The recipient, it is true, then has the object, but you retain sovereignty over it since you make yourself the owner (madu) of a debt (Leach, 1954, p. 142). The inalienable nature of the gift establishes a particular type of debt relation between the transactors. This invariably modifies a pre-existing debt relationship between them because gift transactors are in a state of reciprocal dependence. The meaning of this latter term is best approached by examining that of the concept of 'reciprocal inde pendence'. Marx used this to describe the relationship between people who are aliens (i.e. strangers). Commodity exchange, he argued (Marx, 1867, p. 91), first begins on the territorial boundaries of clan-based societies where those who exchange things treat each other as strangers. In other words, commodity exchange is an exchange of alienable things between aliens. Gift exchange, then, is an exchange of non-alienable things between non-aliens. In practice, the outcome is less clear. In the gift economy of East Africa there is a kind of continuum in exchange relations. Between strangers there is a strict pecuniary relationship; this aspect is less marked between neighbours and tilia (trading partners), and is least so between clansmen and best friends (Schneider, 1957, p. 286). The situation is similar in PNG (e.g., Malinowski, 1961, pp. 177-198; Godelier, 1973, pp. 127-151). The debt relation that the exchange of gifts establishes is to be sharply distinguished from the debt relation that an exchange of commodities may establish. Gift-debt differs from commodity-debt in two important respects. Firstly, gift-debt can be cancelled only by the return of the original gift or an item regarded as a substitute; secondly, a gift debt is always measured at its historic level at the time of the gift and no interest accrues. The former feature derives from the fact that gift-exchange is an exchange of like-for-like (e.g. a pig for a pig) whereas commodity exchange is an exchange of unlike-for-unlike. Polly Hill's description of the important biki gift-exchange system among the Hausa of Northern Nigeria illustrates this point.</page><page sequence="8">126 C. A. Gregory Contributions are not necessarily in cash, but may take such forms as clothes, threshed grain, bundles of grain, small livestock, food together with money, or enamelware; but like must always be 'exchanged' for like, so that, e.g., a donor of threshed grain must be given such produce in return (Hill, 1972, p. 211). Oliver's study of the gift-exchange system on Bougainville Island of PNG illustrates the second characteristic of gift-debt. The time element does not appear to be a factor, since the expected totokai (return) does not vary with the duration of the loan (Oliver, 1955, p. 307). It often happens that the return exceeds the original gift but the effect of this is to create new debt equivalent to the excess of the new gift over the original one, and to reverse the debtor/creditor relationship (Strathern, 1971, pp. 10-14). In order to consolidate some of the points being made here, once again consider exchange in general where A and B exchange both x and y. This is simultaneous exchange, but it can be split up into two parts that can be thought of as occurring at two different points in time. If this pair of temporarily separated transactions is repro duced at a further two points in time, but in the reverse direction, the temporal out comes of the debts thereby created will differ depending on whether the debt was of the commodity or the gift variety. This is illustrated in Table 1. Table 1. Comparison of temporal outcomes of debts created by commodity and gift transactions „ , Particular forms of exchange Time T -&gt; ° Commodity transactions Gift transactions 1 X A becomes creditor to B who A becomes creditor to B who A B receives x as a commodity receives x as a gift o y B cancels debt to A who receives B becomes creditor to A who I B A y as a commodity in return receives y as a gift Q X B becomes creditor to A who B cancels his debt to A who 5 B A receives x as a commodity receives x as a return gift A. y A cancels debt to B who receives A cancels his debt to B who 4 A B y as a commodity in return receives y as a return gift Times (1 and 2) and Times (1 and 3) and (3 and 4) linked (2 and 4) linked Gift-exchange and commodity-exchange also establish different spatial exchange relations. Suppose, for example, that A and B live in different villages and that C acts as intermediary in two two-way exchanges of the form : A G ^ B y y From the perspective of commodity exchange, A's transaction with C constitutes one transaction and G's transaction with B another. Given that the value of x equals that of y, the relationship between all three transactors is over once the transactions are com pleted. But from the perspective of gift exchange a 'road' of a gift-debt is created. The</page><page sequence="9">Analysis of non-capitalist gift economy 127 path of the object x makes C the debtor of A and B the debtor of C ; the path of the object y makes C the debtor of B, and A the debtor of C. B now has possession of A's x and A has possession of B'sjy .Only a reversal of these transactions can eliminate the debts. In practice gift-exchange relations of this type serve to link up people hundreds of miles apart. In the Milne Bay area of PNG the famous kula gift exchange system, first described by Malinowski (1961), results in precisely this. The cattle economy of East Africa can also be understood in these terms. As Colson notes : The herding system still plays its part in maintaining bonds between people who live in distant areas and see each other seldom (Colson, 1951, p. 20). The difference between a commodity-exchange relation and a gift-exchange relation can be summed up as the difference between 'value' and 'rank'. Commodity exchange— the exchange of unlike-for-unlike—establishes a relation of equality between the objects exchanged. When A and B exchange x and y as commodities of equal value a relation of the form x=y is established. In a commodity economy, because of the operation of the law of value, two heterogeneous things are treated as equivalent. Gift-exchange—the exchanges of like-for-like—establishes an unequal relationship of domination between the transactors. This comes about because the giver usually is regarded as superior to the receiver (Strathern, 1971, p. 10). This is a feature that is common to gift exchange systems all over the world. But as Strathern notes: Whether this superiority implies political control over the recipient or whether it merely indicates a gain in prestige on the part of the giver are matters in which individual systems vary (Strathern, 1971, p. 10). The precise meaning of 'domination' is an empirical question; for the subsequent exposition it is sufficient that it implies that the giver has some kind of superiority. Thus when A and B exchange x and y, A is superior to B because he gives him an x; but B is superior to A because he gives him ay. So who is superior to whom ? This is the problem of rank and the answer to the question depends, in the first instance, on the rank of the objects, i.e. their exchange-order. Objects as gifts have this exchange-order rather than exchange-value because the relationship between them is ordinal rather than cardinal. This provides the key to understanding the shell gift-exchange systems (misleadingly called 'shell-monetary' systems) of PNG, of which the so-called Rossel Island 'monetary system' first described by Armstrong (1924) is the most famous example. This island then had and still has a highly developed shell gift-exchange system. Over 20 different ranks of shell-gifts are distinguished. The top-ranking shell gifts are small, highly-polished and extremely rare, while the bottom rank of shell-gifts are large, rough in appearance and in abundant supply. The relation between the top shells and the lower ones was first analysed (incorrectly) in value terms, but as Baric (1964, p. 47) later observed, ' "ranks" rather than "values" . . . represent the picture of the relationships'. Thus a shell-gift of high rank does not equal a number of shell gifts of low rank. Leach (1954, p. 154) provides a similar analysis of the 'units of currency' in the Kachin gift economy. The central idea is that the objects are not interchangeable.1 When A and B exchange x and y as gifts, then, the objects have exchange-order. Suppose x (given by A to B) has higher rank than y (given by B to A). It implies that A is superior to B because he has given the higher ranking gift. The question which then arises is how the rank of objects is determined. 1 Both Leach and Baric draw an analogy with playing-cards : just as a ten of clubs does not equal a pair of fives, a shell of high rank does not equal multiple shells of low rank.</page><page sequence="10">128 C. A. Gregory In the context of the gift economy, the answer to this question involves an under standing of the rôle of women. Because of the rule that intra-clan marriage is pro hibited, for marriages to occur a spatial movement of women between clans must take place. In Papua New Guinea this is regarded not merely as an outcome, but as an exchange transaction with connotations similar to those of gift-exchange. On marriage, a female is never alienated from her clan of origin even though subsequently she will live with a different clan. The same inalienability characterises the objects (sometimes called bridewealth) that simultaneously may be given to a bride's clan at the time of the marriage. The simultaneous gift-exchange of women and things is no different from the gift-exchange of heterogeneous things. The anthropological evidence is clear on this point : In moka (gift-exchange system), pigs and shells are exchanged for each other, but ideally a reversal of the initial transaction should affect an eventual transfer of pigs for pigs and shells for shells. In the same way, while at each marriage bridewealth is given for a woman, a second woman should ultimately be given in return for the first, and thus bridewealth for a bridewealth (Strathern, A. M., 1972, p. 73). It is important to note that the inalienability of women-gifts is interpreted differently from thing-gifts in one respect. A gift-debt generated by the gift of a pig is regarded as liquidated if another pig (not necessarily the same one) is given to the 'creditor'. How ever, a gift-debt generated by the gift of a woman can never be liquidated by the gift of a woman from another clan. In other words, women gifts are regarded as embodying clan characteristics in a way in which thing-gifts are not. Thus the direct exchange of two women between two clans generates two debts of equal rank and two creditors of equal status. In the context of clan societies, Lévi-Strauss called gift-exchanges which lead to the movement of women in a circle between clans 'generalised exchange'. In this process, in a three-clan system, clan A will give a woman to clan B, which gives a clan B woman to clan C, which gives a clan C woman to clan A. (These gifts may not necessarily be made simultaneously.) Lévi-Strauss distinguished such 'generalised exchange' from 'restricted exchange', the direct exchange between clan A and B of a clan A woman for a clan B woman. Although the outcome of the restricted exchange of the 'supreme gift'1 may appear to be formally identical to barter, there is an important social difference : when a woman from clan A is given to clan B, and one from clan B to clan A, the strict inalienability of women as gifts implies that relations are established between the clans rather than the women, i.e., the objects of the transaction. On the other hand, in the case of generalised exchange, women-gifts have a higher exchange-order than thing gifts and the creditor from a woman-gift achieves greater status than one from a thing-gift.2 According to Lévi-Strauss (1949, p. 470), the restricted gift-exchange of women is logically prior to generalised gift-exchange involving women and things. The trans formation from one to the other is effected as the woman is replaced by a symbol. Historically the process is analogous to the process of transformation over time from the barter exchange of commodities to simple circulation of commodities involving money. In Marxian terms, this is the transition from C^-C (the barter of a commodity for another commodity) to C-»M-&gt;C (the exchange of a commodity for money then exchanged for another commodity). The latter can be described as 'selling-in-order-to buy' and under certain conditions it may give way to M ~&gt;C -&gt;M', 'buying-in-order-to-sell', 1 Lévi-Strauss, 1949, p. 65. 2 There are exceptions to this rule (e.g. Strathern, A. M., 1972, p. 75).</page><page sequence="11">Analysis of non-capitalist gift economy 129 where M' is greater than M, and the difference M' — M is surplus value. When this transformation occurs, then, in the final stage, C falls out leaving M -&gt;M', the lending and borrowing of money. A similar kind of approach can be applied to gift economies to illustrate how, historically, what is known as 'incremental gift exchange' (see below) often came to be associated with generalised exchange systems. Let G1 be a 'supreme' gift (i.e. women), G2 a gift of second-rank order (e.g. a shell), G3 a gift of third-rank order (e.g. a pig) etc. Restricted exchange can be written G1 -s-Gl (the exchange of one woman-gift for another) and generalised exchange as G1 -&gt;G2 -»G1 (the exchange of a woman-gift for a shell-gift, then exchanged for another woman-gift). The latter may give way to G2 -&gt;G2', where G2' represents a larger quantity of shells than does G2. This is incremental gift exchange and is very common in Papua New Guinea. It has also been called 'competitive gift exchange', and it tends to flourish in areas where hereditary chieftainship does not exist. This is because in the absence of such a hereditary power system, incremental gift exchange is used as the means to obtain power and status. Since the outcome of such incremental exchange appears to be identical to that of M -&gt;M', many theorists (e.g. Epstein, 1968) have mistakenly treated the process of incremental gift-exchange as identical to that of the borrowing and lending of money at interest, i.e., proceeding to describe the PNG gift economy as 'primitive capitalist'. However, M is an instrument of commodity exchange and G2 an instrument of gift exchange. Not only does G2 differ from M in being inalienable, the motive of the transactions is vastly different. Whereas a capitalist tries to maximise net incomings (i.e. profit), the gift transactor tries to maximise net outgoings (i.e. net credit). It is important to recall that only thing-gifts of the same exchange-order can be measured net. The more debtors a person can accumulate through gifts, the more status, prestige and power he acquires as a 'big-man'. This point is illustrated in Table 2 which shows Table 2. Gifts of one high-ranking shell given to and. receivedfrom other clans by the 16 households of Enona clan, Botukebo village, West Irian, August 1955 ...

A. Gregory some data on the giving and receiving of a high-ranking shell among one clan of a highlands PNG tribe. Household 6 is the big-man's household. He gave 1340 of this high-rank shell away and received only 130 in return. This is only a snapshot of a point in time however, and his status survives only to the extent that he can maintain this position. It should be noted that a large net debt is not necessarily the sign of a 'rubbish-man', as the unim portant men are called. The latter usually exchange very little. A large net debt is usually evidence of a big-man who is temporarily down on his luck. 6. The conditions for self-replacement in a gift economy A central proposition of classical political economy from Smith to Sraffa is that the relations of commodity circulation (i.e. prices) are to be explained with reference to the methods of production and productive consumption. In a gift economy, however, the situation differs considerably because the way in which people reproduce themselves is a crucial determinant of the way in which things are exchanged. As noted in Section 3, clan organisation of the phratry and tribal type are found in Papua New Guinea: thus the following discussion is limited to these. Suppose that the population of a tribe is divided into two clans, A and B, and that the total land available is distributed equally between them. The question now is to specify the necessary conditions for the self-replacement of the society from the perspec tive of the clans. Consider first an individual family of clan A. Assuming a patrilineal system, the father and the children of this family will belong to clan A. Because of the taboo on marriage within a clan (called 'exogamy' by anthropologists), the mother will have come from clan B, and, because of the conventions of the gift-system, still will be classified as belonging to this clan even though she is living on clan A's land. Assume now that this family has two children, one male, and one female. The male, like his father, must marry a woman from clan B, and their children will be classified as belong ing to clan A. On the other hand, because of the exogamy rule, the female will have to be given as a marriage-gift to clan B, and her children will be classified as belonging to clan B. Thus, in such a two-clan system, while males never move from the land of birth, females must always move to the clan land other than the one of origin, while their female children ultimately will always move back to it. This spatial movement of females can be considered as a circular process over time as a result of which each clan reproduces itself. Given that the clan has no finite lifetime, it can be regarded as a timeless entity. The circular process described above can then be conceived of as one in logical not historical time. From this perspective, the following schema in Table 3 can be used to describe one particular way in which a two-clan system achieves a self replacing state. At the end of the 'consumptive production' period, the male members of the son-clans exchange sisters—an exchange classified as 'restricted' by Lévi-Strauss. This redistributes the women over the land, so ensuring that the process can be repeated. At the same Table 3. Schema describing how a two-clan system may achieve a self-replacing state Land Fathcr-clan+mother-clan — Son-clan -(-daughter-clan A A + b ► A + a B B + a * B + b</page><page sequence="13">Analysis of non-capitalist gift economy 131 time, it creates gift-debt of equal rank between the two clans. This is because A gives a 'supreme' gift to B, thereby becoming the creditor of B ; but as B also gives a 'supreme' gift to A, A simultaneously becomes the debtor of B. This exchange is not a barter exchange of commodities for reasons analysed in the previous section. This simple model of restricted exchange can be adapted to allow for different generation groups. Suppose that both clans A and B are subdivided into the generation groups 1A and 2A, and IB and 2B, respectively. From the perspective of an individual clan A family this generational subdivision means that if the system is patrilineal, a man classified as 1A will have sons classified as 2A; the repetition of the reproduction pattern means that his sons' sons will be classified as 1A and his sons' sons' sons as 2A, etc. Thus, from the perspective of the clan, there is a two-generation replacement cycle. Thus, in group terms, 1A is the 'father' of 2A, and 2A is the 'father' of 1A. In other words, 1A is the 'father'-of-the-'father'-of 1A. This is a contradiction from the perspective of an individual family in historical time. However, from the perspective of the clan, it is a necessary condition for self-replacement. This is not simply a logical point: on the contrary, that such an approach to classification is used is supported by the actual anthropological evidence. The Kariera tribe of Western Australia, for example, is divided into four subgroups: 1A Banaka, IB Burung, 2A Palyeri and 2B Karimera. The marriage rules—i.e., the necessary conditions for self-replacement—are given in Table 4. Table 4. Marriage rules of the Kariera tribe Land Father + Mother — Child A 1A Banaka + 1B Burung *. 2A Palyeri A 2A Palyeri + 2B Karimera &gt; 1A Banaka B IB Burung + 1A Banaka ► 2B Karimera B 2B Karimera + 2 A Palyeri - 1B Burung Thus, if a man belongs to 1A Banaka his son belongs to 2A Palyeri, his son's son to 1A Banaka, his sons' sons' son to 2A Palyeri, and his son's son's son's son belongs to 1A Banaka. The kinship terms between groups used in practice by the Kariera express the relationships between the groups in logical time. Morgan called these 'classificatory kinship terms' and distinguished them from 'descriptive kinship terms' which refer to individuals in historical time. This distinction is illustrated in Table 5 which shows how the Kariera used kinship terms: Table 5. Comparison of Kariera classificatory kinship terms with descriptive kinship terms Patri-line Descriptive kinship terms Kariera classificatory kinship terms A i Father's father 1A Maeli 1 A i Father 2A Mama 1 A l Person speaking (ego) 1A Ego 1 A i Son 2A Kandari 1 A Son's son 1A Maeli</page><page sequence="14">132 C. A. Gregory Thus the same term (maeli) reappears every four generations. This of course presupposes the biological reproduction of the people who make up the groups.1 These classificatory kinship terms also express the relations of reciprocal dependence that hold between the transactors in a gift economy. This can be seen by examining the exchange process that self-replacement in this case requires. The consumptive pro duction process alters the initial distribution of groups over the land. For example, at the end of the period land A contains 'children' from clan A only. These people cannot reproduce themselves and before the consumptive production process can be repeated, 1A must exchange 'sisters' with IB and 2Amust exchange 'sisters' with 2B. This spatial exchange of women-gifts restores the initial distribution of people over land and the process can be repeated. Note that because these are gift-exchanges, relations are established between the transactors. There will be 12 such relations established : four direct relations between groups of the same generation and eight indirect relations between groups of different generations. These can be depicted in 4 X 4 matrix (with a zero diagonal). The matrix given in Table 6 shows the terms that the Kariera use to describe these relations: Table 6. Matrix showing Kariera terms for transactor relations Givers Receivers 1A IB 2A 2B 1A 0 3 1 2 IB 3 0 2 1 2A 4 5 0 3 2B 5 4 3 0 Key: 1. mama 2. kaga 3. kumbali 4. mainga 5. kuling The direct exchange relations are all described by the same term (kumbali)—which is what one would expect because all the transactors simultaneously become indebted to each other. This describes a relation of equal rank. However, the intergenerational relations describe relations of domination and subordination. For example reading across row 1A it can be seen that 1A is the mama of 2A and the kaga of 2B. These are relations of domination and the relations mainga and kuling are the respective reciprocal relations of subordination. Strictly speaking it is not correct to say that these relations are the outcome of an exchange of the supreme gift. They are created during the consumptive production process and reproduced via the exchange process in much the same way that 'natural' prices spring from the productive consumption process and are realised in the exchange process. This matrix can be extended to show the terms used to describe the inalienable relationships between the transactors and the transacted. It can also be extended to describe the pattern of these relations over four generations. A 16 X 16 matrix of this type is needed for a comprehensive description of the Kariera case. However, consider ation of complications of this type is beyond the scope of this paper (see Gregory, forth coming, for a formal analysis of this model and for a discussion of its relationship to the systems of self-replacement to be found in PNG). 1 In the Australian case, the European colonisers almost succeeded in destroying the entire aboriginal population. In 1910, when Brown studied the Kariera, only 80 to 90 members of the tribe were left. With the PNG case, on the other hand, an initial peirod of depopulation was followed by a population explosion.</page><page sequence="15">Analysis of non-capitalist gift economy 133 Now consider the case where the population is divided into three clans, A, B and C, and where the total land available is divided equally between them. One schema which will ensure clan self-replacement is that shown in Table 7. Table 7. Schema for ensuring clan self-replacement in a three-clan system Land Father-clan + mother-clan &gt; Son-clan -|-daughter-clan A A + c -—&gt; A + a B B + a &gt;• B + b C C + b ► C + c In order to restore the original conditions of reproduction the women of the daughter clan must move in a 'circle' between clans : a moves to land B, b to land C, and c to land A. This schema illustrates the process which Lévi-Strauss classified as generalized, exchange. A different schema which also would ensure clan self-replacement would involve three pairs of bilateral exchanges between clans A and B, B and C, and C and A respectively. In this case, the circulation of women entails three pairs of restricted gift exchange, in contrast to the single process of generalised exchange described above. While the latter also generates gift-debt of equal rank between the clans, the absence of bilateralism generates a different form of equality. In a generalised exchange system, because A gives a woman to B and gets one from C, A has a gift-credit with B and a gift-debt with C. To offset such bilateral gift-debts, flows of thing-gifts in the direction opposite to that of the women-gifts must occur. Thus A gives things to C, and receives them from B. However, on account of the status of women as the 'supreme' gift, B cannot 'offset' the gift-debt to the clan; thus A is able to establish a relationship of permanent dominance over B. In practice this 'pure' kind of generalised exchange system does not exist in the indigenous economy of Papua New Guinea. Rather, both a system of restricted exchange and a hybrid system incorporating elements of both restricted and generalised exchange are found. Because the hybrid system incorporates such elements of generalised ex change, it may generate incremental gift exchange. This is so since generalised exchange is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the emergence of such incremental exchanges—historically, these have not occurred under a restricted system. In practice, the other main necessary condition for such incremental exchanges appears to have been an unstable hierarchy amongst clans1 (Mauss, 1925, p. 91). This characterises the hybrid system of Papua New Guinea where no one clan establishes a permanent relationship of dominance over a second clan, as would occur in a 'pure' generalised system. It is interesting to note that in some of these hybrid systems the principle that the giver is superior to the receiver is embodied in the kinship terminology. In the Trobriand Islands, for example, the term that is applied to a group of men in a senior generation, tama (elders), is also applied to the group of men who give women-gifts in marriage. On the other hand, the term that is applied to a group of people in a junior 1 Incremental gift exchange and 'big-manship' flourish in PNG because of the absence of hereditary chieftainship; but it only flourishes in those areas where there is generalised exchange of women-gifts. Maurice Godelier (personal communication) also makes this point. He came to this conclusion after working among the Baruya of highlands PNG.</page><page sequence="16">134 C. A. Gregory generation, latu (juniors), is also applied to the group of men who receive women-gifts in marriage (Malinowski, 1929, p. 435). Although all the above examples have been based on a patrilineal system, they could be reworked for a matrilineal one without affecting the argument. The latter are quite common though they must be distinguished from (virtually non-existent) matri archal systems. Both patrilineal and matrilineal societies are patriarchal, and in both cases patriarchy is reproduced by the spatial exchange of women. Theoretically, women could exchange men but instances of this are rare. By ensuring that women circulate, men may obtain more effective control over clan land (Ghowning, 1962). Kinship relations in a gift economy not only define a relationship between groups of men and women, they also define the relationship of groups of people to land. In this latter capacity they are, as Leach (1961, p. 305) has pointed out, 'just another way of talking about property relationships'. 7. Conclusion This paper has attempted to establish two propositions: (1) before Marx's concept of 'consumptive production' can be used to analyse self-replacement in countries such as PNG, it should be developed in the light of a modified version of Lévi-Strauss' con ceptualisation of marriage as the exchange of women between households, (2) gift exchange relations are to be explained with reference to the methods of consumptive production (in contrast the proposition that commodity exchange relations are to be explained with reference to the methods of productive consumption). The demonstration of these propositions must be seen as the first step in a long series of steps towards the analysis of the impact of colonisation on non-capitalist systems of the gift-economy type. In all cases of conquest three things are possible. The conquering people subjugates the con quered under its own mode of production ... ; or it leaves the old mode intact and contents itself with a tribute ... ; or a reciprocal interaction takes place whereby something new, a synthesis, arises (Marx, 1973, p. 97). The uneven penetration of capitalism into PNG means that all of these three possibilities apply. A key prerequisite, however, is an adequate conceptualisation of the indigenous production mode. To achieve this, the approach used here has been to abstract the gift economy elements of the indigenous system from the empirical data and to analyse them to develop concepts that can be applied to the actual historical situation (for the results of the latter see Gregory, 1979, 1980). These propositions can also be seen as a prelude to a critique of neoclassical economic theory of non-capitalist economies. Many theories have been developed within this paradigm with the particular case of PNG in mind (e.g., Fisk, 1962; Stent and Webb, 1975). These theories analyse the PNG gift economy in terms of the familiar neo classical categories: 'marginal utility', 'marginal product', etc. These categories have no meaning within the context of the alternative conceptual framework adopted here. Therefore, if these latter concepts can be developed into a theory with superior explana tory adequacy—a difficult task given the incommensurability of the paradigms, (Feyerabend, 1978, pp. 65-70)—then new insights may well be found concerning the process of change in PNG's indigenous society, including the impact on it of colonis ation.</page><page sequence="17">Analysis of non-capitalist gift economy 135 Bibliography Armstrong, W.
