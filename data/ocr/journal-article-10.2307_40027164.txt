ISBN 954-426-465-5 (vol. 1); 954-426-466-3 (vol. 2) (cloth). The detailed publication of 1,204 fifth- and fourth-mil- lennium B.C.E. burials from a coastal cemetery east of the modern village of Durankulak, in northeastern Bul- garia, marks a new stage in the study of prehistoric south- ern European societies. Excavation of the cemetery, not far from the Romanian border and close to the coastal road from Varna to Constanta, began in 1974 and con- tinued until 1997. The two volumes reviewed here re- flect the close collaboration during this period between the site director, Henrieta Todorova, of the Institute of Archaeology in Sofia, and a galaxy of Bulgarian, Rus- sian, and German scholars, under the joint aegis of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences and the Deutsches Archaologisches Institut in Berlin. This is a handsome publication, richly illustrated, with an impressive range of analytical papers and site data. The first monograph on Durankulak was published in Bulgarian in 1989 (H. Todorova, Durankulak 1 [Sofia]); this covered an initial period of investigation that deter- mined that the peninsula close to the village had been inhabited at various periods between the Late Paleolithic and the 10th century C.E. A mid ninth-century settlement on the peninsula was published with an associated in- land cemetery of 248 burials. Durankulak 2 presents simi- lar data, albeit from different ends of the chronological spectrum. But the two monographs are different in ap- pearance and style. The first volume contained a num- ber of analyses, but its content, materials, and format were constrained by the country's difficulties in the late 1980s. The two volumes that constitute the second mono- graph reflect the notable advances made by the Bulgar- ian publishing industry within the last decade and also the wide-ranging consequences of successful international academic collaboration.</page><page sequence="2">314 BOOK REVIEWS [ATA 110 Volume 1 contains the reports and analyses; volume 2 is an illustrated catalogue of the burials and associated finds. The former begins with a brief foreword (in Ger- man and Bulgarian) that outlines the evolution of the project. An introduction follows (Todorova), which pre- sents the layout, spatial and structural characteristics, and chronology of fifth-millennium B.C.E. structures on the peninsula, an island in the settlement's heyday (11-15). There are photographs and a plan of these structures, as well as a photograph of a putative smelting pit (fig. 7a, b). The chapters that follow are mainly in German, though four are in English. Each begins with a summary in Bulgarian in a smaller typeface. The text has relevant bibliographic items listed at the end of each section in the Harvard style. The conclusions, also in German (349- 53), are summarized in Bulgarian, French, and English. There are no indices. The layout, organization of the contents, clear typeface on high-quality gloss paper, and wealth of illustrative material (some in color) combine to make this a readable and accessible publication. The analytical chapters start with a short geographical and ecological introduction, explaining the site's situa- tion in the Danube's lower estuary and the changes in sea level and temperature after the last glaciation (Todorova [16-23]). T. Dimov presents the spatial orga- nization of the cemetery (24-33), while Todorova out- lines the chronology and development of the cemetery, beginning with Hamangia and related Late Neolithic groups, developing into a full Chalcolithic, with clear parallels in the well-known Varna cemetery, and termi- nating in the Early Bronze Age, datable here to the sec- ond half of the fourth millennium B.C.E. (34-52). This chapter synthesizes a great deal of information derived from the raw data collected. Systematic data on specific burials can be viewed in volume 2, the bulk of which consists of an inventory of burials, drawings of the grave contents in situ, selected finds, and photographs of the skeletal remains. The level of information provided for each grave is more detailed and transparent than any pre- vious publication of funerary data from the region, of any period. Todorova's discussion is mainly concerned with chronological issues and changes in funerary practice, as well as diagnostic grave goods, such as faunal remains. She outlines the relationships between the ceramic evi- dence at Durankulak and its closest cognates in southern Europe. There are helpful tables of relative chronologies (e.g., 49, fig. 33). Of six samples taken, one provided a usable radiocarbon date (grave 536, Hamangia phase 4, which calibrates as 4650/4600-4550/4500). There are clear gender-specific patterns in the choice of grave goods, including animal parts. Skulls of deer and wild donkey (Equus hydruntinus) were found principally in male burials, suggesting a close connection between male status and hunting (Todorova [53-9]). A series of contributions also examines social dimensions. Todorova discusses paleodemographic issues (60-6) and contributes an analysis of ceramic inventories, with tables identifying age and gender-specific variations (81-116) and rank or- dering (267-80). Maja Avramova discusses pigment (117- 19), faunal remains (120-26), and ornaments in metals, shell, and bone (191-206). Todorova's study of spondylus and dentalium ornaments provides a renewed perspec- tive on the availability of these mollusks following the marine transgression through the Bosporus Straits, though she does not refer to recent controversies over this event. The metallurgical analyses of K. Dimitrov (127-58) and I. Vajsov (159-76) are detailed, combining technical re- ports on selected samples (relying on E.N. Chernykh and E. Pernicka for lead isotope analysis and trace elements) with discussions of manufacturing technologies and the social ramifications of metal accumulation. Other spe- cialists contribute studies: Dimitrov on stone tools and artifacts (207-12), N. Sirakov on flint assemblages (213- 46; cf. M. Gurova [247-56]), N. Spassov and N. Iliev on faunal remains (313-24), and Y. Yordanov and B. Dimi- trova on human skeletal remains (325-47). Additional studies include Vajsov on the anthropomorphic figurines, G. Schwarz-Mackensen on various aspects of anthropol- ogy, and E. Bozilova and S. Tonkov on the palynology. The publication of the prehistoric cemetery at Durankulak provides a wealth of primary evidence for a comparison of Balkan, European, and Mediterranean pre- history. Two papers, for example, by Dimov and V. Slavcev, discuss the broader context of the Durankulak evidence within the Dobrudja. At the end of volume 1, an aerial photograph of the island settlement connects the prehistoric horizons with the fourth-century B.C.E. sanctuary of Kybele and the 10th-century C.E. structures published in the 1989 monograph. Todorova refers in her introduction to the interruption of excavations at the island settlement in 1997, due to lack of funding (12). In view of the undoubted international importance of the settlement remains, I hope that readers will petition for the excavations to resume and that a third monograph will present the data from the fifth-millennium settlement, thus contextualizing it with its cemetery.
