To examine the assumption, underlying much ecological theory, that a "Jack-of-all-trades is master of none", a comparison was made of the aquatic predation of four colubrid snakes, two aquatic specialists (Thamnophis couchi, T melanogaster) and two terrestrial-aquatic generalists (T sirtalis, and T elegans). Observations were made in the field, then juvenile snakes were compared under controlled laboratory conditions. The specialists and generalists had qualitatively different foraging repertoires. The specialists made lengthy dives, crawled slowly on the underwater substrate and made long-distance underwater responses to prey: orientation, approach, pursuit, and frontal attack. The general.ists dived briefly, with rapid serpentine locomotion, or searched "terrestrially" by wandering along the shoreline and snatching prey from the water surface. Underwater, the generalists' only prey-directed response was sudden short-distance attack, and they appeared to rely on chance encounters with prey. There were significant differences between the two pairs. In compiarison with the generalists, the specialists 1) captured more fish, 2) spent more time on aquatic search, 3) spent more aquatic search time diving, 4) spent more diving time on the underwater substrate, 5) made more attacks in very category of search in open water, and 6) attacked underwater from a greater distance. Significant differences were not found in attack frequencies in those search categories where underwate r vision is probably unimportant (aerial attacks and attacks in underwater crevices), nor in aerial attack (listances. The specialists' behavioral superiority in respect of their specialization supports the "Jack-of-all-trades" assumption. The observations suggest that this superiority is ass,ociated with superior underwater visual acuity (which may be due to superior visual accommodation). The generalists' principal underwater searching technique (serpentine diving) appears to be energetically costly, and may only be profitable when aquatic prey are especially vulnerable. Nerodia sipedon, member of a genus that is closely related to Thannophis but more aquatic, had a foraging repertoire qualitatively similar to that of the generalists. The similarity may be associated with N. sipedon's nocturnal habits and presumed reliance on non-visual prey cues. Behaviour Vol. 86 (1983) pp. 3 1-54 ALTERNATIVE MECHANISMS OF SOCIAL ORGANIZATION IN MONKEYS T.E. ROWELL and D.K. OLSON Department of Zoology, University of California, Berkeley, Calif., U.S.A. Observations on a captive group of patas monkeys were supplemnented with field observations to analyse the process by which a gregarious animal keeps track of the position and activity of other group members and regulates the distance between them and itself. This process can take place without the exchange of specialised signals (displays) and is described as a mechanismn of group organisation alternative to a mechanism based on the exchange of displays. Displays and formalised interaction patterns can provide additional, complementary information, especially about transient features of social organisation. Behaviour Vol. 86 (1983) pp. 55-71 DETERMINANTS OF DOMINANCE IN MALE STICKLEBACKS (GASTEROSTEUS ACULEATUS L.) TH.C.M. BAKKER and P. SEVENSTER Dept. of Ethology, Zoological Laboratory, University of Leiden, The Netherlands When two males of the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus L.) in reproductive condition are placed in a tank of small size, one becomes dominant over the other in a very short time. In this way a group of isolated reproductive males were tested pairwise on their capacity to become dominant. It appeared that the males could be arranged in a linear order of dominance. Their rank was to some extent correlated with their territorial aggressiveness as assessed in other tests. Their experience in previous dominance tests played a more important role. The brightness of their colouration, however, was probably</page><page sequence="2">644 VOLUME 86 the most consistent and decisive determinant of dominance. The interaction of colour and experience could be traced in the outcome of the dominance tests. The occurrence of roundabout fighting is discussed. Behaviour Vol. 86 (1983) pp. 72-88 PERCEPTUAL IMPRINTING: GENETICALLY VARIABLE RESPONSE TENDENCIES, SELECTIVE LEARNING, AND THE PHENOTYPIC EXPRESSION OF COLOUR AND PATTERN PREFERENCES IN QUAIL CHICKS (C. COTURNIX JAPONICA) JOSEPH K. KOVACH Research Department, The Menninger Foundation, Topeka, Kansas, U.S.A. Eighteen generations of bidirectional genetic selection of quail for early approach preferences between two colours resulted in nearly perfect preferences of blue over red in one and red over blue in another genetic line. This selection also enhanced, over performance of unselected controls, the preference of a grated over a dotted pattern in both genetic lines. In the choices between composite stimuli colour effects dominated over pattern effects. Imprinting to blue or red resulted in robust modification of colour choices. Imprinting to composite stimuli of colours and patterns likewise modified colour bud did not change or only marginally changed pattern choices, suggesting colour dominance in learning as well. However, imprinting to achromatic patterns also left pattern choices unchanged, or modified them only marginally. Joint imprinting to blue and red in variable temporal ratios modified colour choices in ways that reflected influences from both the genetically manipulated initial preference values and the exposure dosages of particular colours. The genetically manipulated preference values and preference combinations of stimuli thus influenced the outcome of imprinting by setting the baselines upon which selective learning acted, by underlying perceptual dominance of particular stimuli, and by facilitating or inhibiting the phenotypic expression of what had been learned. Behaviour Vol. 86 (1983) pp. 89-99 BEHAVIOURAL SIGNIFICANCE OF DUET INTERACTIONS: CUES FROM ANTIPHONAL DUETTING BETWEEN MALES (COSSYPHA HEUGLINI H.) HENRIKE HULTSCH Inst. f. Allg. Zoologie, Abt. Verhaltensbiologie, Freie Universitat Berlin; Germany Antiphonal duetting is regarded as a formalized interaction display between, usually mated, individuals of different sex. Proceeding from observations that antiphonal duetting can also occur between male conspecifics, we investigated the structure and context dependence of the display in aviary kept male robin chats (Cossypha heuglini H.). In the male/male duets, which were confined to a particular dyad of our tests subjects, all characteristic features corresponded to those of the male/female display (Fig. 1). Duet roles were not exchanged between males, and the "female" contribution was exclusively delivered by the younger male. Duetting obviously influenced both, interactions within the dyad (in terms of inhibiting overt aggression) and the territorial behaviours (attacks, chases) towards third introduced conspecifics. During confrontation with such males, the duetters took different roles in attempting to deter an outsider (test 3), which were similar to those observed for mated individuals of a pair. In tests where only one individual could attack, duet rates and attack rates were positively related (Fig. 4). Preceding a duet performance, one male approached the other one (Fig. 3), and restriction of such proximity (tests ls, 2s) lowered both, duet rates and attack rates against an introduced male (Fig. 4 &amp; 5). Our results allow to discuss relationships between duet behaviour and alliance formation in our males. To our knowledge such a cooperation, though presumably temporary, has not been described for adult males of highly territorial bird species.</page><page sequence="3">VOLUME 86 645 Behaviour Vol. 86 (1983) pp. 100-166 INFLUENCE OF CHEMICAL RECEPTIVITY ON REPRODUCTIVE BEHAVIOUR OF THE MALE THREESPINED STICKLEBACK (GASTEROSTEUS ACULEATUS L.) AN ETHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF CRANIAL NERVE FUNCTIONS REGARDING NEST FANNING ACTIVITY AND THE ZIGZAG DANCE J. SEGAAR, J.P.C. DE BRUIN, A.P. VAN DER MECHE and M.E. VAN DER MECHE-JACOBI Netherlands Institute for Brain Research, Amsterdam, The Netherlands The present investigation in concerned with chemoreceptivity in the male three-spined stickleback (Gas- terosteus aculeatus L.) during reproductive behaviour. The functions of cranial nerves were studied with regard to nest building (N) , the increase in the zigzag dance (a measure of the sexual tendency (S)) be- tween N and the day of fertilization (F) of the eggs, the zigzag dance between F and the day of hatching (H), suppression of the zigzag dance (if still present) at H, and fanning activity (P) during these days of a reproductive cycle (F-H). The methods of quantifying S and P, as well as the methods of sectioning the olfactory nerves and the branches of cranial nerves possibly involved in the conduction of chemical stimuli are described. The behavioural changes observed after sectioning the olfactory nerves, branches of cranial nerves or combinations of these nerves are compared with behavioural data of unoperated fish. Special attention is given to behavioural changes following regeneration of transected nerves. Nest building is still possible after sectioning of the olfactory nerves, but occurs only in a few fish. The functioning of the olfactory nerves might influence the development of nest building behaviour by inducing hormonal changes, necessary to start such reproductive activities. During the period between N and F (the latter determined by the observer), the number of zigzags (S) increases from zero up to 100 or more per 5 minute. The olfactory nerves are indispensable for the promotion of sexual behaviour during this period. It seems likely that these nerves are necessary to induce hormonal changes in such a way that the reproductive cycle can proceed from nest building to courtship stage. In the exceptional case that a nest was built by a fish in which the olfactory nerves had been sectioned, the zigzag score remaining low, all other reproductive activities still occurred, including fertilization. Fanning activity in such fish appeared to be quantitatively normal. When the olfactory nerves were sectioned between N and F, at a stage when the zigzag scores had reached an essential level (&gt; 100 per 5 min), both sexual and fanning activity between F and H were normal. This is explained by the supplementary functioning of both the ramus posttrematicus IX and the ramus pretrematicus Xi. Both eggs and embryos stimulate sexual behaviour between F and H. The olfactory nerves exert an exciting function with regard to sexual behaviour during the first days of the cycle (F-H). The area in the roof of the pharynx, situated between the first and second gill arches appeared to perceive stimuli from eggs and embryos, exciting sexual behaviour (referred to as sex-excitation area). The sensory fibres from this area run in a dorsal direction, some joining the rami pharyngei Xi, others one of the rami pharyngei IX (referred to as the S-anastomosis), their excitation increasing during the course of the cycle. The S-anastomosis which joins the ramus posttrematicus IX near or just dorsal of the second arteria branchialis dorsalis, exites sexual behaviour during most days of the cycle (F-H). Similarly, the rami pharyngei XI which join the ramus pretrematicus XI at a point dorsal of the second arteria branchialis dorsalis, excite sexual behaviour during the last days of the cycle. The presence of young following hatching suppresses sexual behaviour, if still present, at H. Such stimuli are perceived by the rami pharyngei IX, which join the ramus posttrematicus IX near or dorsal to the first arteria branchialis dorsalis. Perceiving such stimuli results in an immediate suppression of sexual behaviour. Both eggs and embryos also stimulate fanning behaviour between F and H. Our experiments have shown that the following three nerves are involved in the conduction of such stimuli: nervus olfactorius, ramus posstrematicus IX (including its anastomosis with the ramus pretrematicus Xi, referred to as the F - anastomosis), and the ramus pretrematicus Xi. The involvement of the cranial nerves I, IX and X in the reproductive activities of the male three-spined stickleback is illustrated in a schematic way in Fig. 27.</page><page sequence="4">646 VOLUME 86 Behaviour Vol. 86 (1983) pp. 167-196 OESTROUS BEHAVIOUR AND FEMALE CHOICE IN THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT CYNTHIA J. MOSS Animal Research and Conservation Centre, New York Zoological Society, Bronx Park, New York, U.S.A. 1. During the course of an eight year field study of African elephants in Amboseli National Park, Kenya, from September, 1972 to December, 1980, females were seen exhibiting oestrous behaviour on 154 occasions, during which 43 copulations were witnessed. 2. Five categories of oestrous behaviour are described: a) wariness, b) the oestrous walk, c) the chase, d) mounting, and e) consort behaviour. 3. The oestrous behaviour as described was found to be temporally associated with ovulation, as judged by conceptions, in 70.7% of 58 cases. 4. The duration of oestrous periods is estimated at 2-6 days. 5. On average Amboseli females conceived once every 5 years and for each of these conceptions the female may only have been in oestrus once. 6. Evidence from the Amboseli study suggests that some females may exercise choice in mating partners. For example, females were able to elude their pursuers in 69.4% of all chases (n = 134). Observation of female behaviour during oestrus suggested that some females preferred to mate with males in the largest size class, particularly those in musth. 7. Two possible short-term advantages to females exercising choice in mating partners are suggested: a) avoidance of harassment from other bulls; and b) Large males in musth may be more likely to impregnate a female. 8. A possible long-term advantage to mating with a Large, and therefore older, male could be his ability to pass on a trait for longevity. 9. Although females may be exercising choice among the size/age classes, male-male competition among the Large males may override female choice on the individual level. Behaviour Vol. 86 (1983) pp. 197-214 EFFECTS OF SPECIES-SPECIFIC VOCALIZATIONS ON THE BEHAVIOUR OF SURROGATE-REARED SQUIRREL MONKEYS MICHAEL HERZOG and SIGRID HOPF Max-Planck-Institut fur Psychiatrie, Muinchen, B.R.D. This is a contribution to the study of the communicative behaviour in a primate, the squirrel monkey (Saimiri). It will be shown whether socially inexperienced infants respond differentially to species-specific vocalizations. Six squirrel monkeys were separated from their mothers and conspecifics on the day of birth and surrogate- reared up to their 3rd month of age. In order to counteract general deprivation effects, the subjects received visual, auditory and vestibular stimulation, in addition to the constant presence of the mother surrogate and manipulanda. From the 2nd week on subjects were presented a test object 3-6 times daily. The object was so designed as to elicit behaviour which would usually be directed to conspecifics. When the subjects were able to locomote freely in their cage and approach the object on their own, the following experiment was carried out: Upon each physical contact by the subject with the object, a sound was played back by a loudspeaker hidden in the object. During any 8-min. session only one of five preselected sounds was used. The effect of two vocalizations, caw and cackle, known to be aversive in squirrel monkey groups, was compared to that of two non-aversive ones, twitter and play peep, and a neutral control tone. Caw and cackle resulted in low overall contact and less varied and less playful activities toward the test object. Subjects also were facing the objects more from a distance and spent more time in contact with the mother surrogate as their security figure. Twitter and play peep resulted in an opposite pattern. These findings indicate a genetically preprogrammed basis for perception and processing of species-specific vocalizations.</page><page sequence="5">VOLUME 86 647 Behaviour Vol. 86 (1983) pp. 215-236 USE OF PERCHES AS VANTAGE POINTS DURING FORAGING BY MALE AND FEMALE STONECHATS SAXICOLA TORQUATA P.W. GREIG-SMITH School of Biological Sciences, University of Sussex, Brighton, U.K. The behaviour of individual stonechats (Saxicola torguata) foraging in heathland habitats was studied, to reveal possible influence of the height of the perches used as vantage points on feeding efficiency. Feeding rates, methods of prey capture, time spent on perches, and perching heights were quantified for male and female birds in a pre-breeding, and breeding periods; in addition, the integration of foraging with pre-breeding male song behaviour was examined. Rates of prey capture were highly variable, showing no clear seasonal trends or sex differences. Perching heights averaged 1.0 m in spring, and 1.6 m in summer, and although sex differences were small, males tended to perch higher, and closer to the top of the vegetation, in spring. Comparison with randomly encountered perches showed that birds selected higher perches than the average available. Of three principal prey-capture techniques, only diving to the ground was used in spring, but flycatching, and snatching prey off foliage, were also employed in summer. The change correlated with the appearance of new prey types on the foliage of birch and bracken. Visits to perches were short, averaging 25 s, and showed no clear sex or seasonal differences, but tended to be longer on higher perches, up to 2 min. These data were combined to assess the profitabilty for foraging of different perching heights. For feeding by diving to the ground, the lowest heights provided the greatest capture rates, but for flycatching and snatching, very high perches were more successful. The birds' observed preferences for perches in spring corresponded to those allowing the highest chance of capture per visit, rather than per unit time. In summer, there was no correspondence. Birds departed from perches when their prospects of capture were still high, and thus the lengths of unsuccessful visits cannot be regarded as 'giving-up' times. In spring, the frequencies of foraging attempts and song-phrases were inversely related in short observation periods, and incompatibility of the activities was suggested by the different heights chosen (averaging 0.9 m for foraging, 1.8 m for singing). The lack of differences in the spring foraging behaviour of males and females (who do not sing) suggests that males separated their foraging and singing into discrete bouts. This was apparently accomplished by tactical allocation of time in stable conditions, rather than relegation of singing to times when foraging conditions were poor. Behaviour Vol. 86 (1983) pp. 237-249 IMPORTANCE OF FEMALE'S PRECOPULATORY BEHAVIOUR FOR THE PRIMARY INITIATION OF MALE'S COPULATORY BEHAVIOUR IN THE LABORATORY RAT J. MADLAFOUSEK and Z. HLINAK Psychiatric Research Institute, Prague, Czechoslovakia Precopulatory and copulatory behaviour of adult (90-100 days old) Wistar male laboratory rats in their first encounter with a female was observed. Four levels of female sexual behaviour, characterized by lordosis, presenting, hopping and darting, were used as the experimental variable. A male was considered to have exhibited precopulatory behaviour if he performed at least three specific activities toward the female, such as anogenital exploration, touching the flanks, climbing over, pursuing. The performance of three intromittory copulations, the first of which had to occur within 10 minutes, was used as a criterion of the initiation of copulatory behaviour. In Experiment I it was found that not all the males who exhibit precopulatory behaviour also initiate copulations. With increasing level of sexual behaviour of the female the percentage of males exhibiting precopulatory behaviour hardly changes, but the probability that a male will initiate copulations substantially increases. Whereas no male initiates copulations with a lordotic (passively receptive) female, a darting female provokes copulations in about 90 % of the males. Experiment 2 showed that different breeding conditions, additional testosterone and cadmium intoxication did not influence the established dependence of the male's sexual behaviour on sexual behaviour of the female. Multiple repeated exposures of the males to a presenting female (Experiment 3) led to an increase in the percentage of males initiating copulations, but this procedure did not reach the effectiveness of a darting female at the first exposure. As to the problem of male non-copulators in laboratory rat, it appears to result from the underestimation of the role of the female in sexual interaction.</page><page sequence="6">648 VOLUME 86 Behaviour Vol. 86 (1983) pp. 250-294 FORCED COPULATION IN WATERFOWL FRANK McKINNEY, SCOTT R. DERRICKSON and PIERRE MINEAU Bell Museum of Natural History, Department of Ecology and Behavioral Biology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, U.S.A. 1. Although almost all waterfowl (ducks, geese and swans comprizing the family Anatidae) have basically monogamous mating systems, males of 39 species have been observed to perform or attempt forced copulation (FC) (previously called "rape"). 2. Suggestions that FC is an artifact of crowding in urban mallards, an outlet for thwarted male sex drive, a component of territory defence, or an alternative reproductive strategy of unpaired males are not supported by available evidence. 3. In the case of the mallard, HEINROTH's (1911) interpretation of FC as a secondary insemination method whereby paired males increase their reproductive success by fertilizing some of the eggs laid by females other than their mate is supported by evidence of various kinds. FCs are performed by paired males; they occur during periods in the breeding season when eggs are being fertilized; they are directed mainly at females in prelaying and laying condition; paired males usually defend their mates against males attempting FC (suggesting defence of genetic paternity); paired males have been seen to copulate forcibly with their own mates after the latter have been subjected to FC (suggesting an antidote insemination strategy). 4. Experiments on captive mallards have shown that eggs can be fertilized by sperm delivered during FC and, since females can store viable sperm for up to 17 days, sperm competition must be taking place. Artificial insemination experiments have shown that (a) the second of 2 competing inseminations 6 hours apart overlays the former insemination and is 70% more potent, (b) there is an insemination "window" within 1 hour of oviposition when the next egg in the clutch is fertilized. The extent to which males time their copulations (FCs, pair copulations, forced pair copulations) to take advantage of these patterns of sperm competition is not known. 5. Studies of the lesser snow goose, northern pintail and lesser scaup indicate that FC is a secondary reproductive strategy of paired males in these species also. Observations on 13 species of dabbing duck provide additional evidence for the selection of fertile females as FC targets and the development of male tactics for achieving and combatting FC. 6. It is difficult to rule out the possibility that females could derive certain benefits from FC inseminations (e.g. genetic diversity of offspring) but the costs and risks of being involved in FC assaults can be high and the females apparently try to avoid FC. Female dabbling ducks can be damaged, or even killed, during assaults and female escape behaviour (high flights, diving, hiding in cover) entails energetic costs and wastage of time that are presumably detrimental to females during the period when they are producing eggs. 7. As HEINROTH suggested, FC probably does not occur in swans, most geese and shelducks because it is incompatible with the major roles that paired males play in defence of breeding territories, mates, nest-sites and broods in these groups. The occurrence of FC is snow and Ross goose may be facilitated by colonial nesting. 8. Among dabbling ducks, male territoriality is associated with strong mate-guarding and these charac- teristics appear to conflict with male FC activities. Involvement of paired males in extrapair courtship, polygyny and brood-care may produce additional conflicts with FC behaviour in certain species. 9. In at least 4 species of waterfowl (mallard, northern pintail, lesser snow goose, lesser scaup) behavioural evidence indicates that FC is part of a mixed male reproductive strategy of the type postulated by TRIVERS (1972). Rigorous testing of the hypothesis will require studies to (a) assess the incidence of multiple paternity in wild clutches, (b) distinguish species (or populations within a species) in which paired males actively pursue FC tactics from those in which they merely capitalize on incidental opportunities for FC.

O'NEILL Department of Zoology and Entomology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado, U.S.A. 1. Males of the digger wasp Philanthus basilaris defend and scent-mark small mating territories. There is a high rate of turnover of males on territories on both a daily and seasonal basis due, in part, to predation on territorial males and the large number of usurpations of territories.</page><page sequence="7">VOLUME 86 649 2. The outcome of aggressive interactions on territories is determined by size differences among males, rather than by their status as resident or intruder. As a result, territory holders are larger on average than non-territorial males. The latter, however, remain in the area and attempt to usurp territories or replace residents that have abandoned their perches. Evidence suggests that larger territorial males are also less subject to predation by robberflies and conspecific females. 3. The type of mating system of this species resembles those defined as leks. Males established territories in groups of up to about 50. Nests of females were not found within aggregations of territories. There is a high potential for polygyny due to the lack of maternal care of offspring, dominance interactions which consistently favor larger males and result in intense sexual selection, and asynchronous emergence of females combined with potentially longlived males. Although large males are dominant, no body size related spatial structure to the aggregations could be identified. Aggregations of territories often occur in the same location from year to year, even though males live for only one season.</page><page sequence="8">VOLUME 87 Behaviour Vol. 87 (1983) pp. 1-21 BEHAVIOURAL ASSESSMENT IN MUSKOX CALVES V. REINHARDT and P.F. FLOOD Department of Veterinary Anatomy, Western College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada A photographic record and a quantitative analysis have been made of the behaviour of 7 male and 6 female muskox calves at 6 months of age. Stable dominance relationships were present. The dominance rank was not dependent on aggressiveness. Females were heavier than males, but they were not able to make use of this advantage, since males largely ignored it. High dominance rank ensured undisturbed food selection. The sexes were equally aggressive. Mounting (mock copulation) was a prerogative of males; it did not serve as a demonstration of dominance. Contesting (mock fighting) frequency was the same in males and females, and initiations were made equally often by the two sexes. Females and males did not differ from each other with regard to playing with objects. Nibbling and gentle pawing (stimulating another conspecific to get up) were mainly shown by female calves. Behaviour Vol. 87 (1983) pp. 22-42 COORDINATION ENTRE LA DOMINANCE ET L'ATTRACTION SOCIALE CHEZ SAIMIRI SCIUREUS J.-M. NOEL, R. GAUTHIER et F.F. STRAYER Laboratoire d'Ethologie Humaine, Universit6 du Quebec a Montr6al, Qu6bec, Canada Attraction to high-rank has been proposed as an explanatory principle in primate social organisation, es- pecially among Old World monkeys (CHANCE, 1967; SEYFARTH, 1977). The present research examined the coordination of affiliative activities and social dominance in two groups of captive squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus). Dominance was defined in terms of the resolution of aggressive conflict, while affilia- tion was defined as instances of "approaching", "touching" and "huddling". Although a linear dominance hierarchy was evident for each group, analysis of affiliative data failed to support the hypothesized at- traction to high rank. Instead, our results suggested the existence of an organizing principle involving attractiveness of adjacent ranking group members. These results are discussed in terms of both behav- ioral and demographic parameters which must be included in the elaboration of comparative models of primate social organisation.

BINGMAN Department of Biological Sciences, State University of New York at Albany, N.Y., U.S.A. Three groups of hand-reared savannah sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis) were given different exposure to the sky and an ambient magnetic field during their first summer to investigate the possible effect of experience on the magnetic field orientation of their first autumn migration. Whether ever having seen the sky or not, birds raised exposed to local earth's magnetic field showed the same directional orientation during tests in the local earth's magnetic field. Birds with prior experience with the sky were perhaps better oriented. Birds that were raised outdoors in a 90° shifted magnetic field, however, oriented differently during tests in the local earth's magnetic field. Their orientation tended to be orthogonal to the other groups. The data show that first summer experience can influence the magnetic field orientation of migratory savannah sparrows and in a way which suggests the possibility of a calibration process. 650</page><page sequence="9">VOLUME 87 651 Behaviour Vol. 87 (1983) pp. 54-84 METHODE DE DESCRIPTION DE L'ORGANISATION SOCIALE D'UN GROUPE DE JEUNES BABOUINS PAPIO PAPIO ELEVES EN CORRAL HUGUES LEPOIVRE et BERTHILLE PALLAUD Laboratoire de Psychologie Animale, CNRS, INP. 9, B.P. 71, 13402 Marseille cedex 9, France Using behavioural data obtained on a group of baboons (Papio papio) living in an enclosure, this study affords a method which aims at demonstrating the reality of one or several structures in the social orga- nization. The first step of this method consists of submitting the observed data to a factor analysis. The advantage of that treatment is to avoid determining a priori which behaviours are representative for a par- ticular type of social relationship. In our case, three factors seem to participate in the social organization: the social cohesiveness, the hierarchy, and the social maturity. The following steps of the method made it possible to state that each of these factors corresponds with a distinct structure as well as with a particu- lar graphic representation (or sociograms). A brief analysis of these sociograms is given. When avoiding to determine a priori which behaviours are representative of a given structure one can adapt more pre- cisely the sociometric methods to a given population or species and, through it, detect other inter-groups or inter-specific differences. Behaviour Vol.87 (1983) pp.85-119 A SYNTHESIS OF SLEEP IN WILD BIRDS CHARLES J. AMLANER, JR. and NIGEL J. BALL Animal Behaviour Research Group, Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, U.K. In this synthesis we have attempted to survey and reanalyse the current literature concerning bird sleep. This was achieved by first reviewing present theory describing functions of sleep. Two general models surfaced which encompass many of the specific sleep theories, namely homeostatic and ecological theories. The terminology used to describe sleep and other associated behaviour was organized into an operational hierarchy. We defined loafing behaviour as a general state of immobility. This functional heterogenous group may include comfort behaviour, feeding, social interaction, wariness, staring down and inactive behaviour. Sleep and associated behaviour are considered inactive behaviour. We next described the common sleeping postures as follows: 1. Bill on back or under scapulars; the classical sleep posture. 2. Bill forward or rest-sleep posture. 3. Head on ground. Specific sleep characteristics were also identified as: 1. Quality of sleep based on duration and frequency of eyelid closure. 2. Length of sleep, called sleep session time which is based on the summation of sleep bouts. A sleep bout is defined as the time elapsed during eye closure and opening. 3. Temporal patterning of sleep sessions which are suggested to be dependent on timing of other higher priority behaviours. 4. The resilience (flexibility) of sleep session time. An original analysis was conducted on these sleep characteristics and other environmental, constitutional, behavioural and predation factors. The results indicated that birds experiencing longer daylength slept less each day. Further, birds slept less if (1) overall dangers were greater and (2) they were more communal sleepers. Longer sleep session times were associated with greater exposure while sleeping (i.e. on a lake or mud flat). Several possible functions of sleep were then suggested. Protection theories encompass choice of a safe sleep site while addressing the significance of communal roosting. Recuperation theories were not adequately supported by quantitative studies. Energy conservation theories imply that birds sleep when doing other behaviour might be non-productive. We suggest a model based on eyelid blinking which allows for a degree of vigilance during sleep but which as also compatible with minimizing energy expenditure.</page><page sequence="10">VOLUME 87 Behaviour Vol. 87 (1983) pp. 120-144 WHY ARE DIURNAL PRIMATES LIVING IN GROUPS? C.P. VAN SCHAIK Laboratory of Comparative Physiology, University of Utrecht, The Netherlands There are two main competing theories on the evolution of group living in diurnal non-human primates. The first theory claims that predation avoidance favours group living, whereas there are only disadvantages to feeding in a group and feeding competition increases with group size. The second theory claims that there is a feeding advantage to group living deriving from communal defence of high-quality food patches and that predation is not important. These theories have not yet been rigorously tested. In this paper a critical test is proposed: the theories differ in the predicted relationship between a female's birth rate and the size of the group in which she lives (Fig. 1). An additional test is concerned with the predicted relationship between population density relative to food availability and average group size. Finally, a critical test is proposed of the hypothesis that increasing group size should lead to reduced predation risk by comparing demographic patterns between areas where predators are still present and where they have disappeared. A total of 23 data sets on 13 species were extracted from the literature and supplemented with four unpublished data sets. In all three tests the results provide strong support for the predation-feeding competition theory and are clearly unfavourable for the theory postulating feeding advantages to group living. Such feeding advantages may, however, gain prominence under some conditions.

During autumn 1979 and 1980 and in spring 1980 pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) were tested without any visual cues in the local geomagnetic field of Frankfurt (0.46 Gauss, mN 360°, 66° Incl). The orientation behaviour in funnel shaped cages and radial perch cages was compared. In all three seasons in the funnel cages the birds showed a mean direction which corresponded well with the expected migratory direction. In the radial perch cages no orientation was observed. The reasons for this difference are discussed; it may be in the special locomotory behaviour of captive pied flycatchers. Behaviour Vol. 87 (1983) pp. 157-182 THE CHARACTERISATION OF STEREOTYPED BEHAVIOUR IN STALLED SOWS BY INFORMATIONAL REDUNDANCY A. STOLBA, N. BAKER and D.G.M. WOOD-GUSH School of Agriculture, University of Edinburgh, Scotland This investigation on stereotypies of domestic sows has two aims: 1) to investigate the behavioural profiles shown in the different parities and stages of the reproductive cycle, and 2) to characterise stereotypies by descriptive qualitative and quantitative parameters. As the commonly used functional characteristics of stereotypies were felt to be largely hypothetical at this stage, preventing a deeper understanding of this abnormal behaviour, two purely descriptive approaches were adopted: the first one separated such behaviour from other activities by intuitively essential features, that were condensed into an operational definition. Observations were made on the intensively kept sows of the Edinburgh School of Agriculture pig unit kept in the dry sow house and the lactating sow stalls. From scanning surveys and continuous focal animal samples, behavioural profiles were obtained for the sows of different ages and physiological states. Parity 1 was characterised by frequent and long lasting drowsy stances which probably were a "cut-off" reaction to the unfamiliar Dry-Sow-House environment. In parity 2 and 3 the sows showed increased investigative and manipulative behaviour, but also rapidly emerging stereotyped activities. These increased in kind, frequency and duration over the parities, but were confined to the pregnant animals in the dry sow stalls and virtually absent from the lactating sows which could interact with their piglets. The second approach was to measure the general repetitivity in the behavioural sequences by quantifying their informational content with the redundancy measure C. Both approaches largely agreed when the intuitively defined stereotyped or non-stereotyped sections of behaviour were assessed for redundancy, 652</page><page sequence="11">VOLUME 87 653 the former being significantly more redundant in spite of overlapping C-values. The redundancy of all behaviour, summing variable, positional and stereotyped activities, gradually rose with parity through all cycle stages. In part this was due to the increasing proportion of the intuitively stereotyped sequences, and in part to the increasing redundancy of the remaining variable activity. The redundancy in the stereotyped sequences however remained fairly constant once they were established, and were in all parities well above the levels of variable behaviour. In order to appropriately compare stereotyped and variable activity, redundancies were not only calculated relative to the entire range of elements observed in the stalled dry sows, but also relative to the restricted range of the active elements of all or of each individual sow. All ANOVAs showed significant increases of redundancy over parities, but no effects of pregnancy or interaction to parity. In the discussion the two approaches are compared; from the process of acquiring the stereotypies we then derived the hypothesis, that a likely function could be to reach homeostasis in arousal by warding-off external stimuli and self-generating known sensory input. So far there is nevertheless firm evidence, that stereotypies are signs of major behavioural problems and of concurrently impaired welfare, especially at times of acquisition. Behaviour Vol. 87 (1983) pp. 183-208 RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN SOCIAL STRUCTURE AND RESPONSE TO NOVELTY IN CAPTIVE JACKDAWS, CORVUS MONEDULA L. II. RESPONSE TO NOVEL PALATABLE FOOD GADI KATZIR Sub-Department of Animal Behaviour, Madingley, Cambridge, England The response of captive handreared jackdaws, Corvus monedula, in six groups, to novel palatable food was tested. i) Each group was tested as a whole. ii) Novel food (cockroaches, Periplaneta americana) was provided in a dish in a test room which the birds could enter from their home aviary at will. Ordinary food was simultaneously provided ad lib. iii) In each group one or two birds were most active in the approach and the feeding on the novel food, as measured by frequency of initiation of bouts of approach and feed and/or duration of feeding. iv) Birds that initiated most feeding bouts were the most likely to spend longest durations of feeding on the novel food. v) In all six groups the "initiators" were of mid of low social rank. vi) Socially top ranking birds were distinguished from all others by the combination of two features; (a) they did not act as initiators, and (b) they were not the last to peak in their duration of feeding on the novel food. These results are similar to those obtained for the response of the jackdaws to novel space. It gives further support to the idea that individual response to novelty is related to the social structure. Mid or low ranking individuals may benefit from being more exploratory, while top ranking birds may benefit more by being more conservative. Behaviour Vol. 87 (1983) pp. 209-236 VARIABILITY IN THE RESPONSES OF BLACK-BILLED MAGPIES TO NATURAL PREDATORS DEBORAH BUITRON Bell Museum of Natural History, Department of Ecology &amp; Behavioral Biology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 U.S.A. Encounters between black-billed magpies (Pica pica) and a variety of natural predators were observed during 3 breeding seasons in Wind Cave National Park, South Dakota. How a magpie responded to a potential predator appeared to depend on (1) the type of predator and the threat it posed to magpie eggs, nestlings, fledglings, and adults; (2) the behavior of the predator; and (3) the reproductive stage of the magpie. Raptors were the most frequently encountered potential predators, with magpies reacting more strongly to falcons than to hawks. Reactions to crows and squirrels were most frequent and intense during laying and incubation, while raptors in flight and coyotes were responded to most vigorously during the second half of the nestling period and the first two weeks of fledgling. Perched raptors were almost always mobbed vigorously.</page><page sequence="12">654 VOLUME 87 Diving to within 2 m of a predator appeared to be effective in driving it away. The roles of chasing and alarm calling were less clear, but in addition to alerting mates and offspring to danger, such behavior would impede efficient hunting by the predator and so might contribute to its departure. Only one successful act of predation was observed, but the evidence suggested that owls, hawks and flacons were responsible for most fledgling and adult mortality. No clear cases of nest predation by crows or squirrels occurred, but some clutches of eggs and broods of young nestlings disappeared. Although mates usually mobbed predators together, males were slightly more active, possibly because males were larger and because females were often occupied in the nest with incubation and brooding. Observations of wild fledglings and hand-raised magpies suggest that magpies have an innate fear response to a variety of stimuli and that fledglings gradually learn what to continue fearing from parents, other magpies, and their own experiences. I suggest that although parental investment theory may be basically correct in predicting that young increase in value to their parent as they approach independence, a variety of other factors may affect anti- predator behavior, such as (1) the types of predators likely to be encountered and the relative danger they pose to different age classes; (2) the ability of the parents to successfully drive off a particular predator; (3) the ability of the parents to re-nest that year; (4) the likelihood that a pair will be able to fledge young the following year. Behaviour Vol. 87 (1983) pp. 237-255 SOCIAL ORGANIZATION OF WINTERING BLUE JAYS RICHARD N. RACINE and NICHOLAS S. THOMPSON Departments of Psychology and Biology, Clark University, Worcester, Mass., 01610 U.S.A. Blue jays (Cyanocitta cristata) differ from most New World jays by not breeding communally. Thus, blue jays have been considered less social than other New World jays. This study re-examined blue jay sociality by determining the extent of social organization in the non-breeding season. Color-banded blue jays were observed for 3 years at the Wachusett Meadows Wildlife Sanctuary in central Massachusetts. Of 413 jays that were banded, 78 were present in the Sanctuary at least 4 weeks after their initial banding and 7 others were observed at an adjacent Farm, about 600 m from the main study site. During winter, a jay group centered its activities around a backyard birdfeeder. This group remained distinct from a neighboring group. Many jays returned to the group in successive winters. Replacement of parents by their offspring also occurred. A stable dominance hierarchy was established in the group and this hierarchy showed some stability over successive winters. A blue jay vocalization, the bell call, showed both inter- and intragroup variation in some call parameters. This variation was sufficient to allow for the identification of groups as well as the individuals within groups. Thus, blue jays are highly social during the non-breeding season. Furthermore, this sociality does not appear to diminish in the breeding season. Behaviour Vol. 87 (1983) pp. 256-269 CHAFFINCH SONG REPERTOIRES AND THE BEAU GESTE HYPOTHESIS S.M. DAWSON and P.F. JENKINS Dept. of Zoology, University of Auckland, New Zealand The aim of this investigation was to determine to what extent song repertoires and singing behaviour of chaffinches (Fringilla coelebs) evolved as a means by which resident birds deceive intruders into overestimating the density of residents, making the area appear less suitable for settlement. (1) The chaffinches studied did not show a significant tendency to change song posts synchronously any more than would be expected by chance. (2) Approximately 90% of song type/song post changes were asynchronous. (3) Half of the birds did not repeat their song types with equal frequency, nor did they distribute their singing effort evenly over all the song posts. (4) The degree of similarity between song types in the same repertoire and the degree of similarity between song types from different individuals were not found to be significantly different. (5) No correlation between song rate and repertoire size was found, but it was concluded that seasonal biases strongly restricted this facet of the investigation.</page><page sequence="13">VOLUME 87 655 On the basis of these findings it is concluded that the evolution of repertoires and singing behaviour in chaffinches seems unlikely to have occurred in conformity with the Beau Geste hypothesis. Behaviour Vol. 87 (1983) pp. 270-282 CONTESTS FOR SPACE IN BREEDING CICHLASOMA MEEK!: THE ROLE OF RESOURCE HOLDING POTENTIAL SUSAN J. NEIL Department of Ecology and Behavioral Biology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, U.S.A. 1. The agonistic behaviour of Cichlasoma meeki, the firemouth cichlid, was studied to test five predictions concerning Resource Holding Potential (RHP). Game theoretic models predict that animals should settle contests on the basis of asymmetries in RHP, thereby decreasing contest costs. Breeding pairs of fish were observed to determine how they responded to intruders of different status which encroached into their territory. The defended resource was space, either for spawning or for defence of young. 2. Significant differences were found in the behavioural responses to different species, numbers and sizes of intruder. 3. The majority of contests were short, with extended contests only occurring between conspecific pairs. 4. Escalated (contact) behavioural acts were uncommon, occurring only during extended contests and mainly during contests with conspecific pairs. They were performed primarily at the ends of contests or in bouts within contests. 5. The most costly non-contact behavioural acts were usually performed towards pairs, or towards single fish of size equal to or larger than that of the focal animal. 6. In contests with conspecific pairs there were no differences in the responses towards pairs of different size except in the type of behavioural acts performed. In such contests relative size was apparently not a sufficient asymmetry, and factors such as resource asymmetry may have been of greater importance. Behaviour Vol. 87 (1983) pp. 283-297 CONTESTS FOR SPACE IN BREEDING CICHLASOMA MEEK!: THE USE OF INCREASED APPARENT SIZE DISPLAYS SUSAN J. NEIL Department of Ecology and Behavioral Biology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, U.S.A. 1. The conditions under which firemouth cichlids (Cichlasoma meeki) employed a branchiostegal display (erection of the gill membranes) were investigated to test four predictions concerning Increased Apparent Size (IAS) displays, in which the apparent size of an animal increases without an increase in Resource Holding Potential (RHP). Since size correlates with RHP for many species, IAS displays are assumed to increase,an animal's apparent RHP. If contests are settled on the basis of differences in perceived RHP values, animals exhibiting falsely high values of RHP may avoid escalated contests and thus acquire resources at less cost. 2. The branchiostegal display could be performed alone or simultaneously with any other agonistic behaviour. It accompanied non-contact behaviour acts more commonly than contact acts, but accompanied no type of act more than one third of the times that act was performed. 3. It was performed primarily towards paired intruders, and those equal to or larger in size than the resident. 4. It was performed more often towards larger heterospecifics than towards larger conspecifics, and rarely towards smaller fish of any species. 5. The display often accompanied the first act of a contest, and this probability was greatest for contests with larger pairs of conspecifics. 6. The function of the display seems most likely to be a combination of an IAS display and a signal of a low probability of attack.</page><page sequence="14">656 VOLUME 87 Behaviour Vol. 87 (1983) pp. 298-323 MOTIVATION OF HARASSMENT OF MATINGS IN STUMPTAILED MACAQUES C.L. NIEMEYER and A.S. CHAMOVE Stirling University Psychology, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland, U.K. A group of 12 wild-born adult stumptailed macaques and their 10 offspring, housed in an outdoor en- closure at Stirling University Primate Unit in Scotland, was intensively studied over two years and 271 copulations to account for vigorous harassment of mating pairs observed in this species. Three hypothe- ses were tested: that harassment (a) functions to protect the mating female from aggression by the mating male; (b) functions to reduce the reproductive potentials of mating monkeys; and (c) is motivated by pos- sessiveness of a mating individual. The Protective Hypothesis was rejected. The Reproductive Potential Hypothesis received support only in that any male dominant to a mating male could consistently inter- rupt copulations. All other harassers not only failed to disrupt copulations, but harassed mating kin more than comparable non-kin. The Possessive Hypothesis received support: (a) females directed more harass- ment at matings of females, but not males, with whom they were most highly affiliative; males showed no such tendency; (b) the more desired contact partners, dominant adults, received more harassment than less "attractive" individuals; and (c) post-mating interactions indicated that normally strong bonds be- tween mating monkeys and their usual companions were disrupted by the matings. In matrilineal Old World monkey groups, since the most enduring bonds arise between females, the function of harassment by females appears to be reinforcing access to allies, kin, and dominant individuals.</page><page sequence="15">VOLUME 88 657 Behaviour Vol. 88 (1984) pp. 1-12 EVOLUTIONARY STUDIES OF THE NEW ZEALAND COASTAL MOSQUITO OPIFEX FUSCUS (HUTTON) II. COMPETITION FOR MATES ELISABETH SLOOTEN and DAVID M. LAMBERT Marine Research Laboratory, R.D. Leigh, and Evolutionary Genetics Laboratory, Department of Zoology, University of Auckland, Private Bag, Auckland, New Zealand In the mating aggregations of Opifexfuscus, as in those of many other dipterans, the Operational Sex Ratio is strongly biased towards males. Male Opifex swarm on the water surface of the salt-water pools from which the adults emerge. They grasp pupae and mate with emerging females. We here present evidence for non-random mating among males with respect to body size, and discuss our results in relation to other species with similar mating systems. Our results suggest that reproductive competition among males has been an important factor in the evolution of the Opifex mating system. Behaviour Vol. 88 (1984) pp. 13-33 COMPARAISON ACOUSTIQUE DE LARUS ARGENTATUS ARGENTEUS, L. FUSCUS GRAELLSII, L CACHINNANS (?) MICHAHELLIS ET DU GOELAND ARGENTE A PATTES JAUNES CANTABRIQUE ANNE TEYSSEDRE Laboratoire d'etho-ecologie des Communications animales, 75005 Paris, France Four vocalizations: the trumpetting-calls, mew-calls, call-notes and staccato-calls, have been statistically recorded in six French and Spanish Gull populations, and then compared by the mean of a multivariate analysis. There is no significant acoustic difference between the pink legged herring Gulls of Belle-ile and Oleron Island (France): the vocalisations are a stable character of the subspecies. On the contrary, there are important differences among the vocalizations of Larus argentatus, L. cachinnans (?) michahellis, L. fuscus graellsii and the cantabric yellow legged herring Gull, that relate mainly to their parameters of frequencies and of harmonical structure. The results of the analysis of the four vocalisations differ in some aspects: the distributions of the trumpetting-calls and mew-calls share the four forms in two disjointed groups in which the overlap is more than 30%: on one hand argenteus and the cantabric form (with "high- pitched" vocalizations composed of few harmonics), on the other hand michahellis and graellsii (with "low-pitched" vocalizations composed of many harmonics); the call-notes are heterogenious in graellsii and even more so in the cantabric form. Their analysis allows us to separate argenteus (high-pitched vocalizations, few harmonics) from michahellis and graellsii (low-pitched vocalizations, many harmonics), but the distribution of the call-notes of the cantabric Gulls, although close to that of argenteus, overlap that of michahellis; the staccato-calls of argenteus, michahellis and of the cantabric Gull are close (overlap more than 30% between any two of these three forms) but differ from those of graellsii, that comprise numerous formantic harmonics. Among these four vocalizations, only the two first take part of the sexual behaviour. Their specific sexual recognition is therefore necessary. The dissimilarity between the trumpetting-calls and mew-calls of argenteus and the cantabric Gull on one hand, michahellis and graellsii on the other, might constitute an isolating factor between populations of these two groups, and particularly between the two forms of yellow legged herring Gulls, traditionaly classified in the same species L. cahinnans.

NIJSSEN Psychological Laboratory, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands The hypothesis that the appetitive behaviour of the eating system could inhibit the grooming system, was confirmed. Food-deprived rats searching for food in a box with food hidden in the sawdust, thus showing an actualization of the eating system, showed less grooming behaviour than food-deprived rats inl a box</page><page sequence="16">658 VOLUME 88 without food. When the experimenter soakened the rat's fur by immersing it, the grooming system was activated. Rats searching for more dispersed food displayed an equal level of grooming than rats searching for less dispersed food. The intensively searching rats ate the food more quickly than the less intensively searching rats did. Frustration did not heighten the grooming behaviour. Behaviour Vol. 88 (1984) pp. 42-60 MOTHER-INFANT INTERACTION AND BEHAVIORAL DEVELOPMENT IN SOUTHERN RIGHT WHALES, EUBALAENA AUSTRALIS PETER 0. THOMAS Animal Behavior Graduate Group, University of California, Davis, Ca., U.S.A., SARA M. TABER Harvard Graduate School of Education, Cambridge, Ma., U.S.A. A quantitative study of infant behavioral development and mother-infant interaction in individually iden- tifiable southern right whale pairs was conducted from August to December 1979 at Peninsula Vald6s, Argentina. A period of rapid travel soon after birth is hypothesized to develop calf swimming compe- tence, to enhance the ability of the thin, nonbuoyant calf to rise to the surface to breath, and to hinder detection by predators. Subsequent slowing of travel at 3-4 weeks of age leads to an increase in resting by the mother and an increase in play by the calf. Calf play is centered around the mother and may function to develop motor skills in behaviors useful in social, reproductive, and other contexts as an adult, though in play, calves exaggerated behaviors and combined them in ways different from adult behavior. Days be- fore departing from the nursery area, rapid travel again predominated, presumably functioning to prepare mother and calf for the subsequent migratory period. Nursing comprised about 5% of calves' diurnal be- havior throughout the season but the length of individuals bouts increased with calf age. The mothers' needs to conserve bodily reserves during their 4 month fast at this time may conflict, in terms of individ- ual reproductive strategies, with the calves' needs to develop motor abilities through energy consumptive play. Commencement of migration appears independent of calf age or size and is probably spurred by seasonal factors. Some yearlings and their mothers return to Peninsula Valdes and separate from each other there. Behaviour Vol. 88 (1984) pp. 61-75 FACTORS AFFECTING CALLING BEHAVIOUR IN FIELD CRICKETS, TELEOGRYLLUS AND GRYLLUS (AGE, WEIGHT, DENSITY, AND PARASITES) WILLIAM H. CADE and DAVID R. WYATT Department of Biological Sciences, Brock University, St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada L2S 3A1 The duration of calling by male acoustical insects should reflect the selective forces of mating success and longevity. Nightly calling durations were studied in the field crickets Gryllus integer, G. pennsylvanicus, G. veletis, and Teleogryllus africanus. Immediately after the final molt, males were placed in individual jars in the laboratory. Jars were monitored electronically for the production of calling song. Males started calling at 4 to 7 days on average in each species, and there were no significant changes in duration of calling with increasing age. G. integer was also studied in a large outdoor arena. Arena males first called at approximately the same age as males in the laboratory, and the duration of calling did not change with age. Onset of first calling followed initial production of the spermatophore by a few days in separate samples of each species. Absence of ontogenetic changes in the amount of calling demonstrates that calling and satellite males in field populations of G. integer do not result from age differences. Mean calling duration per night was determined for each male, and there was no difference in mean calling duration with male weight in any species in the laboratory, or G. integer in the arena. G. integer called significantly less on average than the other species. Individual calling durations in G. integer were highly skewed, whereas distributions of the other species were normal in shape. Reduced calling in G. integer may result from the attraction of acoustically orienting parasitic flies, Euphasiopteryx ochraces, to the calling song of this cricket species. Coefficients of variation demonstrated that G. integer is more variable in acoustical behaviour than the remaining species, an observation confirmed by previous field studies.</page><page sequence="17">VOLUME 88 659 Behaviour Vol. 88 (1984) pp. 76-97 LOCAL AND REGIONAL VARIATIONS IN CHAFFINCH SONG AND THE QUESTION OF DIALECTS P.J.B. SLATER, F.A. CLEMENTS and D.J. GOODFELLOW School of Biology, University of Sussex, Brighton BNl 9QG, U.K. Within an area chaffinch songs show considerable variation, but most of them fall clearly into types. Three human observers showed a high degree of agreement about classifying songs from sonagrams, and cluster analysis by computer using measures of frequency and timing gave very similar results for three-phrase trill songs, though less good for those with four phrases. It is suggested that songs fall into types, not because variation is inherently discontinuous, but because accurate learning requires only a small number of repetitions of a song to be heard. With many fewer than this the song is learnt so inaccurately that it forms a new type, and only in the unlikely event of an intermediate number being heard will the copy be hard to classify. Despite the variation within an area, chaffinch songs in different parts of the British Isles have very similar general characteristics. There is a tendency for songs from Orkney to have fewer trill phrases and a longer end-phrase than those from Sussex, but few other significant differences were found and discriminant analysis by computer was only 69% successful at best in classifying songs into the correct groups. While several song types in an area may share features not found in another place, because song types are derived from each other through cultural evolution, there is no evidence to suggest that all the songs in one area have any feature distinct from those in others, as the word dialect might imply. Instead it seems that the various song types within an area get close to exploring the limits of the variability of song found in the country as a whole. Behaviour Vol. 88 (1984) pp. 98-122 TEASING IN YOUNG CHIMPANZEES OTTO M.J. ADANG Laboratory of Comparative Physiology, University of Utrecht, and Burgers' Zoo, Arnhem, The Netherlands Juveniles and infants in the large chimpanzee colony in Arnhem Zoo (The Netherlands) regularly direct seemingly "annoying" behaviour towards senior group-members. It is not clear whether this "annoying" behaviour is best regarded as a form of play or as a form of aggression or whether it falls into an intermediate category. An inventarisation of these "annoying" behaviour patterims, provisionally called "quasi-aggressive initiatives", is presented. Systematical observations were carried out, recording the performance by youngsters of quasi-aggressive initiatives directed towards senior individuals. The data indicate that such initiatives were directly responsible for an important part of the aggressive actions of seniors, although many of the initiatives did not result in aggressive responses. Aggressive and submissive reactions by seniors had a reinforcing effect: juniors continued their actions relatively often. However, when the target animals ignored the junior (the most common reaction) or made friendly contact the opposite occurred: juniors stopped their actions. Quasi-aggressive initiatives were predominantly directed towards individuals outside a junior's own mother-aunt subgroup. The actions were performed irrespective of the rank of the target animals: almost 40% of all initiatives were directed towards individuals ranking higher than mother or aunt (whichever ranked higher). The possibility that quasi-aggressive initiatives were instigated by one or more of several causal contexts is considered. The initiatives for the most part appeared to be performed spontaneously: no possible reason for their performance could be deduced from the situation preceding the initiative. Moreover, quasi- aggressive initiatives occurred almost always unexpectedly: no "warning" was given. While performing an initiative a junior's body posture was tense rather than relaxed: he or she seemed ready to dash away at the first sign of a countermove, indicating that the risk of a punishing retaliation was taken into account. Several alternative hypotheses are discussed, each with their causal and functional aspects. The explanation of quasi-aggressive behaviour in terms of "exploratory aggression" is the one which best fits the data. According to this hypothesis the behaviour is caused by exploratory impulses and functions as a mechanism for youngsters to learn and expand their social limits. Additional observations and analyses are suggested to specify and test this hypothesis on quasi-aggressive behaviour and the role quasi-aggressive behaviour plays in development.</page><page sequence="18">660 VOLUME 88 Behaviour Vol. 88 (1984) pp. 123-144 MATE SWITCHING AND A SEASONAL INCREASE IN POLYGYNY IN THE BANANAQUIT JOSEPH M. WUNDERLE, JR Department of Ecology &amp; Behavioral Biology, J.F. Bell Museum of Natural History, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, U.S.A. The mating system of the bananaquit was studied during four breeding seasons on Grenada, W.I. Color- banded individuals in three sites wer studied to determine the seasonal change in mating system, change in nest predation rates, response of females to nest predation, time lost in mate abandonment, and fledging success of both monogamous and polygynous males and females. Early in the breeding season, bananaquits are monogamous and breeding is synchronized with the rains. As breeding proceeds the nest predation rate increases. Females respond to nest predation by abandoning their mate and nest site and renesting elsewhere. The time available for mate or site selection by an abandoning female is constrained by the increasing rate of nest predation. If a female settles with a neighboring male the time loss in renesting is the same as if she remained with her original mate. However, if she moves further than 100 m the renesting time is greater. Females abandoning their mates following nest predation sometimes settle with males that are already mated; thus the incidence of polygyny increases during a period of asynchronous breeding at the end of the breeding season. Breeding with an already mated male might be possible only if his primary female has eggs or nestlings. During the five month breeding season a diversity of sexual bonds are formed, although many are unstable because of female abandonment of mate and nest site following nest predation. Monogamy was characteristic of synchronous breeding with the first rains of the wet season while polygyny was associated with asynchronous breeding later in the season. These findings are consistent with the predictions of EMLEN &amp; ORING (1977) that the potential for males to accumulate females increases with the degree of asynchrony of sexual receptivity among females. Behaviour Vol. 88 (1984) pp. 145-189 COMMUNICATION OF INTENTIONS IN AGONISTIC CONTEXTS BY THE PIGEON GUILLEMOT, CEPPHUS COLUMBA DOUGLAS A. NELSON Museum of Zoology and Division of Biological Sciences. The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, U.S.A. This observational study of communication behavior of the pigeon guillemot (Cepphus columba) in ag- onistic contexts studied two questions: (1) What factors influence the outcome of interactions between male territory owners and intruders? and (2) Is information about the signaller's intention contained in signals? Pigeon guillemots nest in rock crevices which they defend against conspecifics. Intruders tend to visit single birds on territories as opposed to pairs or unoccupied territories. Male territory owners give a long (mean = 85 sec) series of whistled notes, the Hunch-whistle display, and enter the nest crevice when a female visits. Males also Hunch-whistle "spontaneously" and females approach, enter the nest, and appear to inspect the male's nest-site. Mutual Hunch-whistles usually involve male owners and male intruders, and tend to occur soon after a bird occupies a territory. The outcome of interactions between male territory owners and non-mate intruders was independent of the intruder's sex. Intruders retreated without escalation occurring in 51% of cases and the owner attacked in 27% of the cases. Fights involving both birds were rare and tended to occur early in the breeding season when both males had spent time on the territory in the previous week. No injuries were witnessed in over 600 aggressive interactions. Territory owners won 21 of 23 fights with male intruders. Size and age did not appear to contribute to fighting success. A pay-off asymmetry in favor of owners best explains the dominance of owners over intruders. Analysis of behavior sequences using a three-dimensional contingency table revealed that displays were significantly associated with different responses by recipients and with different subsequent behaviors by the signaller. The response also had an effect on the displayer's subsequent behavior. Flight by recipients decreased the probability of subsequent attack by signallers but other, less predictable forms of interaction between response and subsequent behavior also occurred. Territory intruders flew after 43%4</page><page sequence="19">VOLUME 88 661 of the occurrences of the Neck-stretched display; no owner display preceded attack more than 14% of the time. Variation in the length and frequency of Hunch-whistle notes reflect changing probabilities that the signaller will sit, move, or attack. The owner/intruder dichotomy best explains which bird attacks/flies in an interaction. Variability in the bird's vocalization provides information about when flight or attack will occur. Differences in costs associated with attack versus flight may explain why flight is potentially more predictable than attack.

WOLTON Culterty Field Station, Newburgh, Ellon, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, AB4 OAA 1. An adult male and an adult female wood mouse, Apodemus ssylvaticus (L.), were trained to discriminate between the odours of individual conspecifics in a 'Y' maze. The odour sources considered were faeces and urine. 2. The experimental mice and those from which the faeces and urine were collected were all born in the wild: the males had scrotal testes and the females were imperforate. 3. The experimental male was successfully trained to discriminate between the faecal odours and between the urine odours of two males. 4. The experimental female was successfully trained to discriminate both between the urines of a male and a female and between their faeces, and between both the urines and faeces of two females.

Two rearing conditions obtained: grown up within the birth-group which included the mother and other non-peers, and grown up in a peer-group. With respect to partus experience two classes obtained: primiparae, whose first partus we observed, and pluriparae, of which a later partus was studied. It appeared that the behaviour of the mothers directly before the partus was not affected by the selected variables. Neither during, nor closely after the partus the mothers' behaviour was influenced by ear- lier rearing conditions, but it was affected by partus experience. Pluriparae proved more capable than primiparae in handling child and placenta. The effects of partus experience can be explained in terms of state dependent novelty. Learning in the mother is effected via her own child. Behaviour Vol. 88 (1984) pp. 215-226 CHANGES IN TERRITORIAL DEFENSE PRODUCED BY CHANGES IN CIRCULATING LEVELS OF TESTOSTERONE: A POSSIBLE HORMONAL BASIS FOR MATE-GUARDING BEHAVIOR IN WHITE-CROWNED SPARROWS MICHAEL C. MOORE Department of Zoology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, 98195, U.S.A. Circulating levels of testosterone in male white-crowned sparrows increase when their mates are sexually receptive. Two experiments were conducted to test the hypothesis that this increase in circulating lev- els of testosterone results in an increase in the intensity of male territorial defense. The first experiment demonstrated that males with sexually receptive females are more aggressive than males with nonrecep- tive females under laboratory conditions. The second experiment, conducted in the field, confirmed the laboratory finding and also demonstrated that experimental elevation of plasma levels of testosterone re- sults in increased territorial defense. Thus, male territorial behavior in white-crowned sparrows appears to</page><page sequence="20">662 VOLUME 88 be regulated by changes in circulating levels of testosterone. The fact that this results in males being most aggressive when their mates are sexually receptive suggests that this response functions as mate-guarding behavior. Behaviour Vol. 88 (1984) pp. 227-239 AGE DIFFERENCES IN FORAGING BEHAVIOR OF THE AMERICAN ROBIN (TURDUS MIGRATORIUS) MICHAEL GOCHFELD and JOANNA BURGER Department of Environmental &amp; Community Medicine, U.M.D.N.J. - Rutgers Medical School, Piscataway, N.J. 08854, U.S.A., and Department of Biological Sciences, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, N.J., 08903, U.S.A. Comparison of feeding behavior of adult and juvenile American robins (Turdus migratorius) revealed significant differences in several measures of feeding efficiency and success. Adult robins captured larger food items, made more captures per unit time, took fewer steps, and made fewer unsuccessful attempts. Juveniles took 136% as long to capture each food item and required 161% as many steps as adults, obtaining 25% less food per unit time. During the 10 weeks of the study foraging efficiency fluctuated, apparently reflecting differences in food availability, and we were unable to detect any improvement in efficiency of juveniles relative to adults during the course of the study. Three spot-classes of juvenile plumage were defined, and are believed to reflect slight average age differences, but no difference in foraging efficiency could be detected between the classes, indicating that between about 3 and 5 months of age, improvement must be subtle. This documentation of age differences between adult and juveniles that have been independent 1 to 4 months points to the importance of skill acquisition in foraging behavior in altricial birds. Behaviour Vol. 88 (1984) pp. 240-265 POSITIONAL ORIENTATION DETERMINED BY THE BEHAVIOURAL CONTEXT IN PROCAMBARUS CLARKII GIRARD (DECAPODA: MACRURA) M. TAKAHATA, H. KOMATSU and M. HISADA Zoological Institute, Faculty of Science, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060, Japan 1. The variability in the occurrence probability of the uropod steering response, one of the equilibrium responses, has been analysed quantitatively by a combination of electromyogram techniques and visual observation in the crayfish Procambarus clarkii Girard. 2. Presence of the tilt stimulus alone, whether it might be the body tilt or the substratum tilt, did not necessarily lead to the emergence of uropod steering (occurrence probability = 0.08 and 0.19 in the free condition and in the hanging (fixed) condition respectively). 3. Whenever uropod steering occurred, its direction and magnitude were strictly determined by those of the tilt stimulus. 4. During the abdominal posture movement, the occurrence probability of steering in response to the tilt stimulus was significantly increased (occurrence probability = 0.24 and 0.49). 5.During forward walking in the free-animal observation, the occurrence probability of steering was also significantly higher than during the stance period (occurrence probability = 0.45). 6. During backward walking without the abdominal movement, the occurrence probability of steering showed no significant change. It was increased significantly (0.21), however, when the backward walking was occurring together with the abdominal movement. 7. Turning movements involved the characteristic uropod configuration. The steering response was overridden by turning. 8. The defence reflex also suppressed the steering response. 9. Forward and backward walking, turning, and the defence reflex showed significantly high probabilities of association with the abdominal movement. 10. The uropod steering was preceded by the abdominal movement or the forward walking with a significantly high probability. 1 1. It was concluded that the association of the uropod steering with the abdominal posture movement or the forward walking was causal: the operation of the abdominal posture system or the forward walking system in the necessary condition for the uropod steering to be released by the tilt stimulus. The uropod steering response thus provides a typical example of postural facilitation.</page><page sequence="21">VOLUME 88 663 12. The results of this study clarified the functional organization of the locomotion-related acts including the equilibrium responses in crayfish, showing how they interact with each other to result in a particular behavioural output. The biological significance of such an organization is discussed. Behaviour Vol. 88 (1984) pp. 266-325 INTRASPECIFIC VARIATION IN THE SOCIAL SYSTEMS OF WILD VERTEBRATES DALE F. LOTT Wildlife and Fisheries Biology, University of California, Davis, California, U.S.A. 1. As wild vertebrates are increasingly studied in more than one area or at more than one time intraspecific variation in social systems (IVSS) is increasingly observed. Intraspecific variation has been observed in a number of social systems. Individuals within a single species may be alone or in groups. Their spacing system may be territoriality, coloniality, lekking, dominance or despotism. They may breed monogamously, polyandrously, polygynously or promiscuously. Either both parents or a single parent may care for the young. The parents may or may not have helpers. Parents may or may not pool their young and care for them communally. 2. The evidence so far suggests that most species manifest one of two alternative systems of the same general type, i.e. one of two mating systems or parental care systems.This suggests that there are constraints on their flexibility. These constraints probably include the psychological complexity of the shift from one alternative to another, the compatibility of a particular system with other aspects of the species' natural history, and the species' phylogenetic history. 3. Several ecological variables have so far been identified as correlates of alternative social systems within a species. These variables are generally those currently considered important in interspecific socioecologi- cal analysis: differences in 1) the distribution and abundance of food, 2) the level of competition for food, 3) the level and kind of predator pressure, 4) the level of population density and 5) habitat saturation. 4. Alternative social systems are usually viewed as adaptive responses to the costs and benefits of the observed social system compared to alternative social systems. In this respect, IVSS is treated as intraspecific socioecology. 5. Intraspecific socioecology differs profoundly from interspecific socioecology in the approach taken in accounting for observed social systems. Species differences are typically assumed to be caused by genetic differences resulting from distinct natural selection histories in the populations under consideration. IVSS, on the other hand, often involves facultative switching between alternatives that are clearly not traceable to genetic differences. IVSS may be produced by a number of proximate mechanisms. Nutritional state, hormone levels and particular experiences can all predispose animals to different degrees of aggressivity, which in turn may influence the form of social system that emerges from their interactions. Different experimental histories may make one animal inclined to be a member of a group, and another inclined to be solitary. A high level of one kind of social activity may preclude engaging in another. For example, a territorial male under high intruder pressure may be too busy defending space to give paternal care. 6. Progress in the description and interpretation of IVSS will enrich animal behavior as a discipline. In addition, the ability to predict, and possibly even influence, rapid changes in social systems may contribute substantially to conservation strategies.</page><page sequence="22">664 VOLUME 89 Behaviour Vol. 89 (1984) pp. 1-28 CLASPING BEHAVIOUR IN MACACA TONKEANA BERNARD THIERRY Laboratoire de Psychophysiologie, Universite Louis Pasteur, Strasbourg, France Clasping behaviour was studied in two groups of Macaca tonkeana, one being confined in a cage, the other living in a half-hectare park. Five patterns have been distinguished: grasping the hindquarters, grasping, reaching around, embracing and hugging. Clasping may occur in three contexts: greeting, aggression and sexual harassment. There seems to be no direct relationship between context and pattern of clasping. However, there is substantial variation in form and context according to age- and sex-class. Females are the individuals mostly involved in clasps, being initiators as well as receivers; adult males also initiate numerous clasps but receive few. Adult and subadult males especially use grasping the hindquarters while other age- and sex-classes more often use reaching around. Clasping in aggression is more characteristic of females than males. Several behaviours may be associated with clasping. The accompanying behaviours are more frequent in initiator than in receiver. Clasp is often followed by social grooming, mount, wrestle or another clasp. The results of this study in Macaca tonkeana may be compared with information from other studies of non-human primate species. This allows one to draw several conclusions: 1. Frequency, form and distribution of clasping vary from one species to another. There is great variation in certain species, for instance, Macaca tonkeana. 2. Several behaviours usually accompany clasping and may modulate its meaning. 3. Clasping behaviour shows many similarities to mounting behaviour. Although these two behaviours have different origins, they have acquired similar social functions. 4. Clasping plays a prominent role in control of aggression. In Macaca tonkeana, this behaviour is espe- cially used in appeasement (an individual receiving aggression clasps its aggressor during the aggression), reconciliation (an aggressor clasps its antagonist after the aggression) and non-agonistic protection (a third individual intervenes in an agonistic interaction by clasping the aggressor). Non-agonistic protection is an interaction which was until now described only in chimpanzees. Behaviour Vol. 89 (1984) pp. 29-58 COPULATION IN GOLDEN HAMSTERS: BEHAVIOR OF INTACT VERSUS OVARIECTOMIZED FEMALES GIVEN HORMONAL REPLACEMENT MARY N. PERKINS, MIKE S. PERKINS and BRADFORD N. BUNNELL Dept. of Psychology, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia 30602, U.S.A. Behavior of Syrian golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) during sexual satiety tests was examined across estrous cycle days in intact females and as a function of hormonal replacement in ovariectomized (OVEX) females. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate differences between artificially induced and naturally occurring estrous behavior and to determine whether such differences affected the behavior of the male partner. The results of this study indicated that: 1. The hormonal replacement regime given to OVEX females primarily affected the induction of, but not the amount of time spent in, receptive behavior. a. When given only estradiol benzoate (EB) very few females exhibited frozen lordosis, and when such behavior did occur, the latency was quite long and little time was spent in this posture. b. Following administration of EB and progesterone (P), the number of females that became receptive increased with increasing dosages of EB. For females that showed frozen lordosis, the latency was short and a considerable portion of the test was spent in this posture. 2. Achievement of ejaculations by the male partner did not imply that the female was receptive. Males ejaculated on several tests with females that were not considered receptive because lordosis was either absent or occurred intermittently; lordosis typically was no maintained during the male's intercopulatory intervals, and female attempts to reject or abort mounts by the male were frequent. 3. The hormonal replacement regime given to OVEX females did not mimic naturally occurring events. The behavior of OVEX females differed significantly from that of intact females: a. Receptive behavior of natural estrous females differed from that of induced estrous females in that the former showed facilitated initiation and maintenance of frozen lordosis. b. Toward the end of the tests, natural estrous females were more likely than induced estrous females to approach and attack the male. Such behavior has been proposed to promote reinitiation of copulation</page><page sequence="23">VOLUME 89 665 by males (BUNNELL et al., 1977), but it remains to be demonstrated empirically that such approaches or attacks facilitate the continuation of copulation. c. Although fights occasionally occurred with induced estrous females, natural estrous females never engaged in fighting. d. Nonestrous intact females showed a higher frequency of defensive-rolls, vaginal scent marking, and attacks than nonreceptive OVEX females. 4. The type of female with which the male was tested affected his performance. Males initiated copulation more quickly and achieved more ejaculations with natural estrous than induced estrous females. 5. A particular response pattern, defensive-rolls, was identified that may represent rejection behavior: a. This pattern was characteristic of nonreceptive females, and was rarely observed in receptive females. b. The frequency of this response was elevated during tests in which males achieved ejaculations with nonreceptive females. Behaviour Vol. 89 (1984) pp. 59-72 THE SIGNIFICANCE OF A HOVERING DISPLAY AT NESTS OF THE LONG-TAILED TIT AEGITHALOS CAUDATUS PETER W. GREIG-SMITH School of Biological Sciences, University of Sussex, Brighton, England Breeding long-tailed tits were studied to determine the significance of a hovering display performed by birds bringing food to nestlings. Its contexts implied that it represents communication to other adults, rather than to nestlings, or predators. Three-quarters of nests with young were attended by one or two 'helpers' as well as the parents, and all birds made hover displays. Feeding visits to the nest tended to be synchronous. This pattern was related to the hover display, which if performed by the second of two birds visiting the nest together caused them to return more quickly, an more often synchronously than if there was no display. Two functional aspects of this effect were tested. It did not serve to accelerate food delivery to nestlings after they had been deprived, nor did it minimise the presence of adults near nests that were most vulnerable to predation. The importance of the display may lie in its promotion of communal foraging by the adults. Behaviour Vol. 89 (1984) pp. 73-89 FUNCTION OF MANX SHEARWATER CALLS IN MATE ATTRACTION A.E. STOREY Department of Psychology, Memorial University, St. John's, Newfoundland, AlB 3X9 Canada Playback experiments were used to study the role of vocalization in mate attraction by Manx shearwaters, a nocturnal seabird. Pre-breeding birds were exposed to test calls of male and female shearwaters calling from the range of normal locations: above the colony as in a flyover call, on the ground in the colony, or from within the nesting burrow. Both female and male test calls increased the frequency of male calling but only male calls increased the frequency of female calling. These findings suggest that male calls 1) facilitated competing responses from other males that are attempting to attract females to their burrows and 2) stimulated calling in available females that require more directional information to find the advertising male. Male calling location, inside or outside the burrow, probably reflected a compromise between being audible to females and being susceptible to predation. Because the call was more widely broadcast, male test calls played from outside the burrow caused more females to land in the colony than the same call played from inside the burrow. However in a simultaneous choice test between a burrow and an outside male test call, males calling from inside did not lose females to the adjacent outside male. Thus calling from inside the burrow in an area where another male is calling outside maximized female attraction while minimizing risk of predation. The male call played from inside the burrow attracted as many females as a pair call from inside but the response of females to the pair was less sustained, indicating that duetting pairs inhibited the response of unpaired females. Male and female calls emanating from above the colony suppressed the rate of female flyover calls suggesting that during this test condition other birds stopped calling in an attempt to orient to the source of the test call.</page><page sequence="24">666 VOLUME 89 Behaviour Vol. 89 (1984) pp. 90-116 THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SONG VARIATION IN A POPULATION OF DARWIN'S FINCHES B.R. GRANT Division of Biological Sciences, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, U.S.A. Males of Geospiza conirostris, the large cactus finch, on Isla Genovesa, Galapagos, sing a single, precisely copied song. There are two song types in the population, and these are sub-divided into 3 and 5 discrete song sub-types respectively. Adult males sing only one song sub-type throughout life. Songs sing the same song sub-type as their fathers' and do not copy the songs of either natal or breeding territory neighbours. Significantly more of the males holding territories with neighbours of unlike (heterotypic) song type obtain a female than males in territories with no heterotypic neighbour. Pairs in territories with a heterotypic neighbour fledge significantly more young than do pairs in territories with no heterotypic neighbour. Significantly more of those young born on territories with a heterotypic neighbour, that survive to become adults, obtain a mate, than do those surviving young born on territories with no heterotypic neighbour. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that the relative greater importance of song for species recognition in this population has made it advantageous for males to have a single, short, distinct, precisely copied and stable song. The necessity for recognizing both song types as conspecific has produced a unique mating pattern which favours pairs in territories with a heterotypic song neighbour. This allows young to associate visual and auditory cues of father and neighbouring male during the short period of imprinting. A small effective population size, combined with the observation that no female has been known to mate with a male of the same song sub-type as her father's, suggests a possible kin recognition systems to avoid inbreeding. Behaviour Vol. 89 (1984) pp. 117-127 THE RESPONSIVENESS OF NEWLY BORN CLUN FOREST LAMBS TO ODOUR SOURCES IN THE EWE MARGARET A. VINCE and T.M. WARD ARC Institute of Animal Physiology, Babraham, Cambridge, England Two groups of newly born lambs, twelve ("suckled" lambs) having been fed by the mother and aged between 3 and 21 h, and twelve ("unsuckled" lambs) taken at birth with minimal olfactory experience of the dam, were tested with the smell of three substances taken from the mother and three taken from an alien ewe. The substances were inguinal wax, wool and milk. Changes in heart and breathing rates and in behavioural activity were used as indices of the lambs' response. Results showed that lambs in both groups responded most markedly to the smell of wax. Behavioural responses consisted of head movements, oral activity and bleats and in unsuckled lambs were given significantly more to the smell of maternal, than of alien wax. Unsuckled lambs responded more to all six odour sources than did suckled lambs. In unsuckled lambs the rate of breathing rose significantly during stimulation with the smell of maternal wax and this response was also significantly different from that given by unsuckled lambs to alien wax. In suckled, but not unsuckled, lambs there was a significant rise in the heart rate during and after stimulation with maternal wax, but not in response to any other odour source. Results are discussed in terms of "teat-seeking" behaviour in newly born lambs and the question whether the unsuckled lambs' capacity to discriminate their own mother's from alien wax depends on prenatal olfactory experience. Behaviour Vol. 89 (1984) pp. 128-146 IS THE PARENTAL-CARE BEHAVIOUR OF AEQUIDENS PARAGUAYENSIS (CICHLIDAE) OPTIMAL? WOLFGANG MROWKA Zoologisches Institut der Technischen Universitat, D-3300 Braunschweig, Federal Republic of Germany Aequidens paraguayensis from South America is a biparental larvophilic mouthbrooder. Adhesive eggs are laid on a substrate and fanned until hatching (substratebrooding). The hatching larvae are taken into the mouth by the female. Subsequently the parents relieve each other in mouthbrooding their offspring</page><page sequence="25">VOLUME 89 667 (larvophilic mouthbrooding). In comparison with pure substratebrooders-which are thought to represent the ancestral state-the time lag between spawning and hatching is shortened. This is interpreted as due to a general selective advantage of the mouthbrooding technique over the substratebrooding technique. Why then didn't evolution favour the transition from mouthbrooding of larvae to mouthbrooding of eggs (ovophilic mouthbrooding) thus allowing the extension of mouthbrooding up to spawning like in other cichlid species? An hypothetical answer is that this is not due to the lack of the adequate selection pressure but may relate to the nonavailability of appropriate ovophilic variants. This would imply that the parental care behaviour in this species is not optimal. To support this hypothesis experimental evidence on how broodcaring is regulated is given: l. The uptake of larvae at hatching is induced by stimuli from the hatching wrigglers. Mouthbrooding can be induced at any time of the substratebrooding phase by presenting larvae to the adults. 2. The readiness to take up larvae into the mouth is maintained by the simultaneous presence of larvae within the mouth and of egg-like structures outside of it. 3. Females with induced uptaking readiness are not able to retrieve adhesive eggs from the substrate. 4. Females without uptaking readiness fan adhesive eggs, but eat loose eggs. 5. Females with induced uptaking readiness take up loose eggs in their mouths and mouthbrood them successfully at least until hatching. They behave like ovophilic mouthbrooders. Experimentally created ovophilic variants can be used to test the non-optimality hypothesis in nature or under semi-natural conditions. It is concluded that at least two independent traits must change simultaneously within the same generation to produce an ovophilic variant out of a larvophilic ancestor: on the one hand induction of an egg eating inhibition together with mouthbrooding readiness, on the other hand loss of adhesiveness of eggs. In the neodarwinian view of evolutionary change this is only possible if there is pleiotropy of the traits under consideration. The unlikeliness of pleiotropy may explain why A. paraguayensis has not become an ovophilic mouthbrooder, i.e. is not optimally designed. Behaviour Vol. 89 (1984) pp. 147-173 RELATION OF BEHAVIOURAL ACTIVITY RHYTHMS TO THE CHANGES OF DAY AND NIGHT. A REVISION OF VIEWS ERIK TETENS NIELSEN Sherwood Hammock Biol. Lab., Fort Pierce, Box 69 FL 334450 U.S.A. Behaviour is in many cases remarkably well adjusted to the periodic changes of day and night (the diel) (Chapter I). It is a generally accepted idea that this relationship is based on a presumed self-sustained oscillation regulation all functions of living matter relating to the diel (Chapter II). This paper proposes an alternative mechanism: a combination of time-linked disinhibition (called sensi- tization) and activity thresholds, determined by ambient factors specific for the species in question. It explains certain difficulties in the circadian model (Chapter III) such as ASCHOFF'S rule for circadianism and the temperature independence of the free-running rhythm. It has so far been found to be in agreement with the observations, and the deductions based on the hypothesis have time and time gain been confirmed by the experiments. Behaviour Vol. 89 (1984) pp. 175-199 THE "FEED: FEED" DECISION: HOW GOLDFISH SOLVE THE PATCH DEPLETION PROBLEM NIGEL P. LESTER Department of Psychology, University of Toronto, Canada, and Ethology and Neurophysiology Group, School of Biology, University of Sussex, England The "feed: feed" decision concerns the problem of how an animal chooses between various feeding activities. Optimal foraging theory fails to account for this decision-making process because it does not describe how animals obtain information about their feeding opportunities. The model discussed in this paper describes how this information is obtained and how it influences the "feed: feed" decision. The model is first described in a simplified form, the dynamic matching rule. This rule states that the animal allocates time to each patch in proportion to the number of rewards it recently obtained from each. In the case where food is available in different patches, it predicts a gradual development of preference for the better patch. Results from published studies where patch profitabilities remained constant are</page><page sequence="26">668 VOLUME 89 shown to support this prediction. The model is tested by examining how goldfish distribute their time between two patches, when these patches are depleted as a consequence of foraging. The model predicts that goldfish will first develop a preference for the initially higher density patch, but that a reversal in this development will occur once they deplete this patch below the other patch. The results are shown to support this model. Limitations of this simple model are subsequently discussed. It is shown to be a simplified version of HARLEY'S (1981) "relative payoff sum" rule. HARLEY'S model identifies two factors which interact in determining behaviour. One is an excitatory effect that results from feeding; the other describes what the animal has learned from previous experience. (The dynamic matching rule did not consider the latter effect.) Predictions made by this model are also supported by the goldfish results. The functional implications of HARLEY'S model are discussed. It is shown that this model predicts equi- librium behaviour which closely approximates the optimal response. Thus, it describes how behavioural mechanisms are structured so that animals will forage efficiently. Finally, it is argued that this model, in its present state, describes the structure of a motivational control system. Learning processes appear as parameters in the model, the determinants of which remain to be identified. Behaviour Vol.89 (1984) pp.200-219 THE "FEED: DRINK" DECISION NIGEL P. LESTER Department of Psychology, University of Toronto, Canada, and Ethology and Neurophysiology Group, School of Biology, University of Sussex, England The "feed: drink" decision is investigated in an attempt to discover how internal and external factors interact in controlling behaviour. The problem is attacked from both a functional and causal perspective. A functional approach is used in suggesting how internal and external factors should interact if the animal is to achieve a maximally efficient regulation of internal state. Here, I rely on an optimality model proposed by SIBLY &amp; MCFARLAND (1976). Predictions made by this model are discussed, and it is shown that results from published studies on feeding and drinking in Barbary doves are not consistent with this model. It is argued that this is because animals lack information about external factor levels. This information can only be obtained by assessing the consequences of their prior behaviour. A motivational model is proposed to account for this process. Simulation experiments are done in order to reveal predictions made by this model. These experiments mimic ones that were done using Barbary doves, and it is shown that the behaviour of this model agrees precisely with that seen in these birds. The model correctly predicts effects due to behaviour interruption and changes in food and water availability. The functional implications of this model are considered by comparing simulated behaviour sequences with sequences predicted by SIBLY &amp; MCFARLAND'S optimality model. In certain situations, there is close agreement between simulated and "so-called" optimal sequences. For this reason, it is argued that the motivational mechanisms described are designed to service the goal that SIBLY &amp; McFARLAND assumed in generating their optimality model. The goal is to regulate internal state in a maximally efficient manner. Behaviour Vol. 89 (1984) pp. 220-240 ZUR VERHALTENS-SYNCHRONISATION BEI GRUPPENWEISE GEHALTENEN REHEN (CAPREOLUS CAPREOLUS) CLAUDIA MERTENS Abteilung Ethiologie und Wildforschung, Zoologishes Institut der Universitat Zurich, Schweiz Three groups of 4 adult roe deer each were kept as naturally as possible, but at extremely high density with artificial feeding; each group had access to an open pasture and a wooded area within its enclosure. The main factor recorded over 15 months and analysed was the synchronization of activity (time and site) within and between groups. While no significant synchronisation of the whole population at the defined level could be found (fre- quency of observations with all 12 individuals visible on their respective open field), there was high synchronization between members of the same group during specific times of the year and day. It appears that social mechanisms operate within groups to coordinate group-activity and group-movements. Each group was observed separately for intra-group synchronization in continuous protocols of 60 minute- intervals. Movements of every group-member out of and into the wooded area, as well as-aggression</page><page sequence="27">VOLUME 89 669 between individuals were recorded. Absolute synchronization, i.e. minutes per observation-hour with all 4 roe deer visible, is constant over the whole year; relative to the overall activity of each single individual, independent of the presence of group-members, synchronization is high from December to the end of April and low from May to the end of August; September through November are transition months. Absolute and relative synchronization are higher in the dawn-and dusk-hours than during the day. In general, the behavior of the captive animals corresponds to that of free-living roe deer; they are more gregarious in winter and rather solitary in summer. In the enclosure, where animals cannot emigrate, but food supply is nevertheless optimal during the whole year, the animals have adapted to the situation as follows: The gregarious phase, with a high degree of group-coordination, lasts longer than usual is spring and group disintegration is incomplete in summer. There is also evidence that adaptation is accompanied by reduced aggressiveness; the resulting increase in tolerance between group members may be a direct consequence of the optimal food situation. The three observed groups differ quantitatively in the degree of adaptation. Apart from factors related to differences in the experimental situation of the groups, individual differences (= personalities?) appear to play an important role in the group's adaptability. Behaviour Vol. 89 (1984) pp. 241-250 NATURAL HISTORY AND ACOUSTIC BEHAVIOR OF A GREGARIOUS CRICKET CHRISTINE R.B. BOAKE Cornell University, Ithaca, N.Y., U.S.A. The cricket Amphiacusta maya (Gryllidae: Phalangopsinae) was studied in the field in Costa Rica and in the laboratory. In the seasonal habitat of Guanacaste Province, C.R., adults are found only during the first 4 months of the rainy season. Adults and subadult nymphs form aggregations each dawn and disperse at dusk. Within the aggregations, males chirp, fight other males, and occasionally mate with females. The acoustic behavior of these crickets differs from that of the better-known field crickets in three muajor ways. First, males do not produce a calling song. Second, the chirps given in aggressive and courtship contexts are nearly indistinguishable spectrally and temporally. Third, the species-typical chirp does not elicit phonotaxis in adult females or in nymphs. Possibly the calling song would no longer provide a selective advantage to males because females are in their vicinity regardless of male behavior. Additionally, acoustic signal similarity may be a result of selection for aggressive signalling in both contexts (aggression and courtship). Thus these modifications in acoustic signals may be adaptations to a gregarious mating system. Behaviour Vol. 89 (1984) pp. 251-260 PARENTAL DIVISION OF LABOR IN A MONOGAMOUS FISH MURRAY ITZKOWITZ Biology Department, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA 18015, U.S.A. Both parents of the monogamous Texas cichlid (Cichlasoma cyanoguttatum) participate in offspring care and territorial defense. These activities are typically synchronized, with and without intruders being present, such that only dne parent is way from the offspring. During the egg and wriggler stage, the male spends more time patrolling the territory while the female devotes more time to offspring care. During the fry stage, both parents tend to remain with the offspring. Either sex can rear the offspring in the absence of the mate. With the removal of the mate, the female's activities remain largely unchanged while the male (in the absence of the female) becomes female-like. It appears as if the male adjusts his responses according to the activity of the female.

The Jacob ewes bleated more than the Dalesbred ewes except when the Dalesbreds could see their own lambs and for 30 sec after the lambs were removed. Both breeds increased their bleating more</page><page sequence="28">670 VOLUME 89 to own lambs than to alien lambs, but the difference was significantly greater throughout the 120 sec for the Dalesbred ewes bleating at lambs of either 10 or 20 days of age. The Jacob ewes differentiated more between own and alien when the lambs were 20 days old. When their own 10 day old lambs were removed, both breeds bleated more than after removal of alien lambs. When lambs were removed at 20 days, only Dalesbreds bleated more to their own. It is suggested that different breeds of sheep use vocalisation in different ways and that Jacob ewes bleat more in any situation, whereas Dalesbreds bleat more to communicate with their own lambs.

The aim of the current study is to explore rules for interpersonal behaviour via direct observation and to relate these rules to aspects of depression, as assessed by means of clinical judgement. Because looking and speaking are the most important elements of a dyadic interaction, the timing of looking in relation to speech-pause behaviour was studied during a psychiatric interview. Looking and speaking were recorded for 29 endogenously severely depressed in-patients and for the interviewing psychiatrist. Methods of analysis are presented extensively. Four types of pauses, i.e., pauses within the speech of the patient and of the psychiatrist and switching pauses between the psychiatrist and the patient and vice versa, were distinguished. The analysis focusses on these 4 types of pauses and their preceding and following speech fragments. All speech-pause behaviour occurring during an interview was subdivided into these 4 types of speech-pause-speech sequences. The temporal distribution of looking was then described in relation to each of the 4 types of sequences. Two methods were used to deal with differences in duration of speech and pause fragments. One method describes the timing of looking with absolute time units; the other method uses relative time units. Further, the methods enable us to study whether differences in the duration of speaking or pausing coincide with different patterns of looking. Analysis of the data revealed that such relationships exist. Moreover, within a group of depressives different degrees of retardation (a measure for psychomotor functioning) coincide with different patterns of looking. The lesser amount of looking in retarded patients is discussed in relation to functions of looking and possible consequences for interpersonal behaviour.

SOMMEIJER and LUC L.M. DE BRUIJN Laboratory of Comparative Physiology, University of Utrecht, The Netherlands In Melipona favosa the court of workers surrounding the queen during the "extra-oviposition period" is formed principally by those workers who are actively participating in cell building in that period. These bees shuttle intensively between the cells, which they are building, and the distant resting queen. It is concluded that the gradual increase in court acts performed by these workers is of importance for the regulation of the locomotive pattern of the queen. The principal builders are the most active court bees at that time. The specific behaviour of the court workers should be considered as a form of "competitive communication". Similar ritualized court activity has been described for other stingless bee species. In certain species very striking worker-queen co-actions, termed by us as "bee-dances", have evolved. It is concluded that these "bee-dances" have developed for the purpose of conveying information to the queen and that this evolution is, in this group of bees, related to the peculiar temporal structure of oviposition.</page><page sequence="29">VOLUME 90 671 Behaviour Vol. 90 (1984) pp. 1-24 GREAT TITS AND GIVING-UP TIMES: DECISION RULES FOR LEAVING PATCHES R.C. YDENBERG Edward Grey Institute of Field Ornithology, Department of Zoology, Oxford, U.K. In this paper I examine the hypothesis that animals employ simple decision rules in exploiting patchily distributed food. This idea arises from the supposition that animals probably cannot compute the optimal patch residence time in the same manner that is calculated in optimal foraging models. Instead they may only approximate the optimal solution using a simple, robust rule-of-thumb. I considered three rules-of- thumb that great tits foraging in a simple experimental habitat may use: a number expectation, a time expectation, and a giving-up time. The experimental habitat consisted of an operant patch in which great tits had to search for food hopping on a perch. The probability of reward declined for successive patch hops according to a predetermined stochastic schedule. In order to maximize food intake, the great tits had to occasionally leave the patch and fly across the experimental room to reset the reward schedule by hopping on a second perch. Three different lines of investigation were followed to test which of the three departure rules were em- ployed: (a) a statistical analysis showed that there was s strong tendency for great tits to leave the patch only after several successive hops had gone unrewarded; (b) a computer simulation showed that a sim- ple giving-up rule could produce a distribution of patch residence times similar to that observed; (c) an experiment in which the reward schedule was manipulated, successfully altered the patch residence times in accord with predictions made on the basis of giving-up time rule. Thus, all three tests produced evi- dence in favour of the giving-up time rule. Although the great tits used a giving-up time rule, a residence time would have resulted in a higher rate of intake. One potential explanation of this apparent error is that the natural food of great tits has a clumped distribution, to which a giving-up time is better suited than a residence time rule. Finally, I point out that the observed giving-up time was much more variable than might be expected if it were adjusted solely in response to the habitat rate of intake. I suggest some hypotheses to explain this large variation. Behaviour Vol. 90 (1984) pp. 25-45 THE EFFECTS OF BIDIRECTIONAL SELECTION FOR SOCIAL DOMINANCE ON AGONISTIC BEHAVIOR AND SEX RATIOS IN THE PARADISE FISH (MACROPODUS OPERCULARIS) RICHARD C. FRANCIS Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, State University of New York at Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY 11794 U.S.A. A population of paradise fish (Macropodus opercularis) was subjected to five generations of bidirectional selection for social dominance in order to investigate correlated changes in agonistic behaviors. In addition to the high and low dominance lines (HD and LD respectively), a third dominance line was created through selection for individuals closest to the median in dominance success. The MD line provided standard opponents for members of the other two dominance lines and served as a control for inbreeding effects. The response to selection was asymmetrical. After five generations of selection the LD line had diverged significantly from the MD line, but the HD line had not. None of the three factors known to cause an asymmetrical response to selection (directional gene frequencies, directional allelic dominance and inbreeding depression) can account for the response to selection found here. The divergence of the HD and LD lines with respect to dominance success was not accompanied by any changes in the measures of aggressiveness. The F-5 generation of the HD and LD lines did not differ significantly for any of the measures of aggressiveness used here, indicating that social dominance and aggressiveness are not intimately related. An alteration in the sex ratio of the HD line was an unanticipated byproduct of selection. The F-5 generation of this selection line contained an overwhelming preponderance of males. Interpretation of these results is complicated by the fact that environmental factors such as temperature and the degree of crowding probably influence sexual differentiation in this species. The social crowding factor, in particular, was found to be important and was investigated in a preliminary way. For all three dominance lines it was found that as crowding increased, so did the proportion of females in a brood. Fish raised in physical isolation showed a strong tendency to become males. These results suggest that sexual differentiation is socially mediated. Within a given brood, fish of high dominance status tended to become males and fish</page><page sequence="30">672 VOLUME 90 of low dominance status tended to become females. The results from the isolation-reared fish indicate that it is not dominance per se that promotes maleness, but rather, the condition of being undominated. Under uncrowded conditions an individual is, on average, dominated by fewer fish than under crowded conditions. Above and beyond this density related trend in the sex ratios, however, there were significant between-the- line differences. The HD line showed a greater proportion of males than the other dominance lines, over all density conditions. It appears that selection for high social dominance constituted selection for maleness. This response to selection indicates a continuum of genetic sex in this species and a polyfactorial mode of inheritance. The alteration in the sex ratios might also explain the asymmetrical response to selection for social dominance, in that the HD line did in fact exhibit a greater proportion of dominant fish, though not a greater proportion of dominant males, than the other two dominance lines. As such, the asymmetrical response to selection would be an artifact of the measuring procedures. Behaviour Vol.90 (1984) pp.46-79 SYNTACTIC STRUCTURES IN THE VOCALIZATIONS OF WEDGE-CAPPED CAPUCHIN MONKEYS, CEBUS OLIVACEUS JOHN G. ROBINSON Florida State Museum, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida 32611, U.S.A. Capuchin monkeys, Cebus olivaceus, combine different types of calls to form compound calls. These compound calls are syntactically organized (i.e., there is a predictable ordering of call types in the com- pound call). The analysis of the syntax of animal communication necessarily includes: (a) Accurate classification of types of calls, and a demonstration that calls that occur both alone and in compound calls are structurally similar. (b) Description of the syntactic rules generating compound calls or call sequences, and classification of types of compound calls or call sequences. (c) Examination of the social circum- stances or contexts in which both single and compound calls occur. I followed these steps using a large sample of Cebus olivaceus calls, recorded in riparian gallery forest in central Venezuela. The calls were initially screened using a real-time spectrum analyzer, and a group of structurally related call types was selected for further analysis. Temporal and frequency characteristics of 868 of these calls were measured from sound spectrograms produced on a sound sonograph. Call classification involved first defining a very large number of possible call types on the basis of these characteristics, and then using a discriminant analysis to identify which types should be lumped together. A stepwise procedure was followed, using only calls which occurred singly, until five call types (squaws, chirps, trills, whistles, screams) were statistically separable. Two of these types (trills, whistles) showed considerable within- type variation and were further subdivided into four variants each. Discriminant analysis was then used to demonstrate structurally similarity between calls produced singly and those in compound calls. Social circumstances were defined using similarities in the vocalizer's actions, arousal, orientation to and distance from the presumed receiver. Use of call types, when given singly, covaried predictably with social circumstances and presumably with the internal state of the vocalizer. Different calls expressed different internal states on a continuum from contact-seeking to contact-avoiding. Use of trill and whitle variants also covaried with social circumstances. Different variants expressed different states on a continuum from affiliation or submission to aggression. Combinations of internal states, in theory, might be expressed as intergradations or intermediates between different call types. However, such intermediate states are often coded syntactically. Syntactically organized compound calls accounted for 38% of the total sample. The distribution of social circumstances in which compound calls are given was intermediate between the distributions of the constituent call types, which presumably indicates an intermediate internal state. Compound calls are generated by syntactic rules closely analogous to lexical rules of human language. Specifically they act like compounding rules that combine two lexical entries to form a third. They are not analogous to the grammatical rules that generate human sentences.</page><page sequence="31">VOLUME 90 673 Behaviour Vol. 90 (1984) pp. 80-113 VOCAL COMMUNICATION IN RACCOONS (PROCYON LOTOR) OTTO J. SIEBER Department of Zoological Research, U.S. National Zoological Park, Smithsonian Institution, Washington D.C. 20008, U.S.A. The study describes structure, ontogeny and contexts of raccoon (Proc yon lotor) vocalizations and inves- tigates whether structure and motivation interplay in the way predicted by general motivation-structural rules (MORTON, 1977, 1982). Observations during a full reproductive cycle in a mixed group of captive raccoons indicate that they use an elaborate vocal repertoire including 13 calls (Table 1). Two calls are tonal (whistle, squeal), three noisy (short, bark, growl); four have a mixed structure (cry, screech, gecker, grunt) and four have pulsed syllables (chitter 1, chitter 2, churr, purr). Though some calls grade into one another, the repertoire is largely discrete. Three calls are present at birth and form the nestling repertoire. The adult repertoire gradually develops through the time of weaning (Fig. 2). Several calls are characteristic for the sexual and parental phase. Most calls are associated with one or a few contexts (Table 2). Four calls are utilized by animals while distressed and have an attracting effect on others. Four calls express hostile motivation and repel other animals. Five calls are used by animals approaching another or having body contact; they serve in promoting or maintaining contact. Calls used in a similar contexts show remarkable structural similarities. Distress calls are tonal or mixed, hostile calls noisy in accordance with motivation-structural rules. Contact calls deviate in being noisy and low in basic frequency. Possible reasons are discussed. A comparison of the vocalizations in other carnivores reveals that the structure-motivational pattern found in raccoons is a wide-spread phenomenon in carnivores. Behaviour Vol. 90 (1984) pp. 114-124 A FACTOR ANALYSIS OF SEASONAL, BEHAVIORAL, HORMONAL AND BODY WEIGHT CHANGES IN ADULT MALE BARHEADED GEESE, ANSER INDICUS JOHN P. DITTAMI and HEINZ-ULLRICH REYER Max-Planck-Institut fur Verhaltensphysiologie, Seewiesen and Andechs, F.R.G. Individual measurements of courting, aggression, pairbond displays, body weights and the circulating levels of testosterone, LH, T4 and prolactin in male barheaded geese were subjected to a factoral analysis. Data from the whole year were analysed and then broken up into pre-breeding and post-breeding components and re-analysed. Some parameters remained clumped in the same factors throughout like aggression and pair-bond displays, LH and testosterone, and prolactin and body weight. Others, especially behavioral and endocrinological parameters were only linked on either an annual or seasonal basis. Behaviour Vol.90 (1984) pp. 125-150 THE DEVELOPMENT OF MATE CHOICE IN ZEBRA FINCH FEMALES CAREL TEN CATE and GERRY MUG Zoological Laboratory, University of Groningen, Haren (Gr.), The Netherlands SONNEMANN &amp; SJOLANDER (1977) found that zebra finch females raised by their own species (Z, females) differ in mate preference from females raised by Bengalese finches (Zb females) when given the choice between a Z male and a B male. Their data also showed an own species bias (Zz females strongly preferred Z males, whereas Zb females showed about equal interest in Z and B males). Several authors mentioned the existence of a preference for species-specific characteristics independent of early experience (a so called 'innate' preference) as a cause for an own species bias. This conclusion can be doubted for theoretical and methodological reasons and the question for the process leading to an own species bias in zebra finch females seems completely open. We investigated several possible causes of the own species bias. Our experiments suggest that the final preference in Z females may be influenced by three independent processes.</page><page sequence="32">674 VOLUME 90 First, visual stimuli are involved. Information on these seems to stem exclusively, or at least largely from parental influence. No initial preference for visual characteristics, independent of experience with Z or B has to be assumed. Second, experiments indicate that a preference for actively courting males is present. The process under- lying this is unknown but seems independent of the one giving rise to a preference for visual stimuli. Third, during the period between raising and testing (during which the females were visually isolated) the preference changes with age. Here too, the underlying process is unclear. Several possible causes for this change are discussed. The process underlying it is probably different from the other two. Altogether the results indicate that the own species bias may be the result of several independent devel- opmental processes, which in combination led to a bias in testing. Behaviour Vol.90 (1984) pp. 151-166 COOPERATIVE INTERACTIONS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL IN THE INTERTIDAL CLUSTERING OF NERITA TEXTILIS (GASTROPODA; PROSOBRANCHIA) G. CHELAZZI, J.L. DENEUBOURG and S. FOCARDI Istituto di Zoologia dell'Universita, Firenze, Italy; Service de Chimie Physique I1 U.L.B., Bruxelles, Belgium; Istituto Nazionale di Biologia della Selvaggina, Ozzano Emilia, Italy 1. Somalian populations of the intertidal gastropod Nerita textilis Gmelin show a vertical separation between resting (mid-upper eulittoral) and feeding (lower eulittoral) zone. During high tides and mostly diurnal low tides some snails remain scattered (SF), while other form aggregations (AF) at lower levels of the rocky shore. During the mostly nocturnal low tides both SF and AF migrate downward to feed on microalgae. 2. Lower and upper aggregations are mostly frequented around neap (NT) and spring tides (ST), respec- tively. Clustering significantly reduces the exposure to waves during high tide, and probably overheating and dehydration during diurnal low tide. 3. About 90 percent of the total population enters into the cluster system throughout each NT-ST-NT cycle. Clustering begins to increase at NT and falls at ST, reaching a maximum (52 percent of the population) between NT and ST. The relative frequency of transition between SF and AF shows a spike after NT and falls after ST. The inverse transition (AF to SF) is negatively correlated to the amount of AF. 4. Return to the original cluster after one feeding excursion is high (76 percent) and decreases slightly at increasing intervals (about 40 percent after 14 feedings migrations), but it becomes significantly lower after one or more rest phases spent in SF. 5. The field study suggests that the periodical (NT) increase in density at the lower rest-zone (tide-pools belt), long-lasting chemical marking of collective rest sites and releasing mucus trails during feeding excursions cause the clustering. According to this hypothesis, a primer group stops at each aggregation site at NT, mostly returning to it by self-trailing after each feeding migration, while the progressive recruitment of snails from SF is caused by the interindividual trail-following during the return migration from the feeding ground. 8. The same model can explain the clustering behaviour of other intertidal gastropods, though the impor- tance of the different parameters (periodical variation in zonation, marking of rest places, trail-following) probably vary among the different species. Behaviour Vol.90 (1984) pp. 167-183 SOME OBSERVATIONS OF THE CARAVANING BEHAVIOR IN THE MUSK SHREW (SUNCUS MURINUS) KEIICHIRO TSUJI and TOMOHIKO ISHIKAWA Department of Psychology, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Aichi Prefecture, Japan Observations of caravaning were made on the domesticated musk shrew (Suncus murinus) with particular reference to its developmental aspects. In a rearing box (Experiment I), caravaning appeared from 10 to 22 days of age, peaking at 16 days. In the open-field test (Experiment II), it occurred over a range from 5 to 22 days, with its peak at around 13 days. Its formation patterns also changed with age of days; five patterns were identified in this situation. Another type of test (encounter test; Experiment III) showed a sensitive period similar to that obtained in Experiment II. Caravaning peaked at a period shifting from the mother-initiative stage to the young- initiative stage in the mother-offspring relation. Inanimated model released caravaning, as was expected</page><page sequence="33">VOLUME 90 675 (Experiment IV). It occurred for the same period, peaking at the same age of days, although on closer examination it was found that the smaller peak obtained in Experiment II disappeared. The findings of the present study suggest that caravaning plays an important role in the mother-offspring relation of this species. Developmental changes in caravaning seem to reflect the maturation process of sensory functions. Possibilities of releasers in caravan formation were discussed by referring to histological and electrophysiological investigations. Behaviour Vol. 90 (1984) pp. 184-202 COURTSHIP IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER: BEHAVIOUR OF MIXED-SEX GROUPS IN LARGE OBSERVATION CHAMBERS L.S. EWING and A.W. EWING Department of Zoology, University of Edinburgh, Scotland 1. Mixed-sex groups of Drosophila melanogaster were observed in chambers sufficiently large to allow females to decamp during courtship. 2. There were two main experimental classes; one OVR, consisting of groups of four males and four virgin females (octet with virgin receptive females) the other, SVR comprising four males and two virgin females (sextet with virgin receptive females). Supplementary information was obtained from a third group, SMU (sextet with mated females) consisting of four males and two mated females. 3. Quantitative information was obtained on a number of courtship parameters which could then be compared with information from single pairs of the same Drosophila stock in the small cells normally used for courtship studies. 4. Courtship in groups was observed to consist of a number of short bouts (OVR: 14 s., SVR: 7 s.) interspersed with longer periods of non-courtship (OVR: 20.9 s., SVR 23.1 s.). Females could be courted by one or more of the available males and could mate with a male initially rejected. The shorter courtship bouts in SVR groups appeared to be related to increased interference between courting males which resulted in females terminating the bout. 5. This general pattern of courtship differed considerably from the pattern in small cells where females received a single continuous bout of courtship, consisting of 41% vibration and lasting on average, 130 s. until copulation. In the group situation vibration comprised only 24% of each courtship bout and there were a number of gaps in courtship before copulation occurred. The overall mean courtship times including breaks were 399 s. (OVR) and 511 s. (SVR). 6. A detailed analysis of the observations on the groups in the large chambers showed that virgin females terminated the majority of bouts and did so by flying off or moving off. These elements alone of the so-called rejection responses listed by other authors appeared to have a rejection function. No function could be attributed to the other responses which may be in part an artefact of small observation cells. 7. Female decamping was not preceeded by a specific act by the male but could occur anytime during following/orientation and vibration. It rarely occurred after licking or attempted copulation. 8. The courtship of successful males different from that of unsuccessful males only in that more time was spent courting the female eventually mated; bouts being longer and more numerous. Behaviour Vol. 90 (1984) pp. 203-214 SOME NOTES ON FACTOR ANALYSIS OF BEHAVIORAL DATA ROBERT SHORT University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Colorado, U.S.A. JOHN HORN University of Denver, Colorado, U.S.A. The use of factor analysis with behavioral data is examined critically. Although there are good reasons to make wider use of factor analytic techniques in behavioral research, several important pitfalls should be avoided. Samples should be of adequate size, both absolutely and relative to the number of variables analysed. Variables should be reliable and devoid of scoring dependencies. One should not allow the same components to appear in different ratio variables, difference scores and composites. Variables and subjects should be carefully selected to represent a substantive design for the study. Ideally this design should stem from empirically-based, well reasoned theory. Careful thought should be given to the question of the number of factors to extract. Rotation of factors should be based on the model reflected in the</page><page sequence="34">676 VOLUME 90 design for the study. One should be wary of using mathematical-statistical indices with factor coefficients. The correlation, as such, and the standard error for a correlation, do not have the same properties when applied to arrays of factor coefficients as when used with free-to-vary numbers. Behaviour Vol. 90 (1984) pp. 215-223 VIGILANCE AND PERCEPTION OF FLOCK SIZE IN FORAGING HOUSE SPARROWS (PASSER DOMESTICUS L.) MARK A. ELGAR, PAUL J. BURREN and MELISSA POSEN Department of Zoology, University of Cambridge, Downing Street, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England Perception of flockmates is clearly important if individuals' vigilance behaviour depends as much on the behaviour of other individuals as on the flock size. We attempted to evaluate the importance of flockmate perception in the scanning behaviour of free-living house sparrows Passer domesticus by observing them at an artificial feeder. Typically, sparrows would await on an adjacent wall, where they could see all the birds in the feeder, before hopping down to forage. Individuals' inter-scan time increased with flock size, but when a barrier was placed across the feeder, preventing sparrows in the feeder from seeing the other side, individuals scanned according to the number of visible sparrows, rather than the total number in the feeder. When two smaller feeders were placed at different distances apart, individuals greater than 1.2 m apart scanned independently of each other. Behaviour Vol.90 (1984) pp. 224-240 THE RESPONSES OF WOODPIGEONS (COLUMBA PALUMBUS) TO PIGEON DECOYS IN VARIOUS POSTURES: A QUEST FOR A SUPER-NORMAL ALARM STIMULUS I.R. INGLIS and A.J. ISAACSON Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries &amp; Food, Worplesdon Laboratory, Tangley Place, Worplesdon, Surrey GU3 3LQ, England 1. It has been suggested (MURTON, 1974) that the white wing marks of the woodpigeon (Columba palum- bus) could form a visual alarm signal; the species has no auditory alarm call. Experiments were conducted to investigate this possibility with the long term goal of developing an efficient scarer for this species. 2. Preference experiments were conducted over four summers. Pigeons coming to a preferred feeding site were given the opportunity of settling within one of two areas containing woodpigeon decoys (i.e. corpses) of various types. 3. Woodpigeons preferred to settle with closed-winged decoys than with open-winged decoys. This was because close-winged decoys were attractive but also because open-winged decoys were repellent. The attractive properties of closed-winged decoys were not species specific; closed-winged stock doves (Columba oenas) decoys were just as attractive. The repellent properties of the open-winged decoys resulted not from the novel posture or from the body of the decoy but solely from the outstretched pair of wings. More specifically the white wing marks were necessary for this effect; open-winged decoys with no wing marks were nor repellent. 4. Decoys with modified wing marks were tested to try to obtain super-normal repellency. Doubling the area of the wing marks produced such an effect. 5. Although the exposure of the wing marks is a necessary and sufficient condition for a repellent effect, the open-winged posture is rarely seen in a living woodpigeon. The marks are usually visible as an oscillating pattern. The likely importance of the rate of oscillation of this pattern is discussed.</page><page sequence="35">VOLUME 90 Behaviour Vol. 90 (1984) pp. 241-258 ETUDE DE LA RECEPTIVITE SEXUEL,E DE LA FEMEI,LE DE CALLIPHORA VOMITORIA (DIPTERES, CALLIPHORIDAE) AU COURS DU PREMIER CYCLE GONADOTROPE I: APPROCHES COMPORTEMENTALE ET PHYSIOLOGIQUE MARIE TRABALON and MIRFILL,E CAMPAN Laboratoire de Psychophysiologie, ERA n° 700, Universit6 Paul Sabatier, 118 Route de Narbonne, 31062 Toulouse Cedex, France With both behavioural and physiological parameters we have studied the development of the sexual receptivity in females Calliphora vomitoria during the first gonadotropic cycle. From a behavioural point of view, we have noticed a temporal patterning in the appearance of the maximum attractivity (4 days after emergence), minimum courtship duration (5 days after emergence) and the maximum receptivity (6 days after emergence). The sexual receptivity is correlated with vitellogeny and increases with the growth of the ovaries. It is partly inhibited by precocial ovariectomy (6 hours after emergence) and totally suppressed by allatectomy (3 hours after emergence). A topical application of ZR-515 (1 Iul at a 3 Ig/,ll concentration) induces an anticipative receptivity (1 day) and an acceleration of ovarian growth. We obtained an optimal effect when the application takes place some hours before the beginning of vitellogeny (2 days instead of 3 hours after eclosion). Concentration of roughly 30, 300 and 600 tg/ltl have an inhibitory effect upon the sexual receptivity and its associated parameters. The attractivity of females for males is only partly related to their receptivity: it appears early (2 days) for all flies, but it remains always lower in non-receptive mature females compared to receptive mature females. Neither ovariectomy nor allatectomy are able to prevent it to appear, which suggests that JH is not involved in that process. Behaviour Vol. 90 (1984) pp. 259-301 ONTOGENESE DES SYSTEMES DE COMMUNICATION CHEZ LA GENETTE (GENETTA GENETTA L.) JEAN-JACQUES ROEDER Groupe 6co-6thologie des Mammiferes, Laboratoire de Psychophysiologie, 7, rue de 1'Universit6, 67000 Strasbourg, France The aim of this work was to study the ontogeny of communication in genets (Genetta genetta L.) focusing on three main points: -the time course of communication in mother and young; -the relation between the different communication systems: vocal communication, direct olfactory com- munication (sniffing the conspecific, nasal contact) and indirect olfactory communication (scent marking); the link between social interactions in the litter and the time course of communication. Social interactions within the litters were studied during feeding. It appeared that young became indepen- dent of their mother through two main stages: a gathering stage during which each infant tried to catch solid food at the mother's mouth; a scattering phase which began with the acquisition of predatory be- haviour and during which each individual ate its prey at a particular place in the cage. During the first stage, some behaviours such as avoiding the conspecifics, stealing their prey, and pursuit of conspecifics appeared rarely in the mother and were not observed in young. During the second stage, their frequencies increased and agonistic behaviours (growling, hissing/headdarting) appeared in both mother and young. Changes in communication were seen in relation to these variations in social interactions. In mothers, a contact call was emitted with a high frequency during the gathering stage, this frequency decreased from the 4th month after birth and this call was seldom emitted after the 8th month. The same variations were observed concerning direct olfactory communication. Nasal contacts were mainly located to the dorsal region of the young and later to their ano-urogenital region. Scent marking frequencies were low during the gathering stage and increased during the scattering stage. In young genets, the frequencies of vocal communication (contact call, mew) increased until 7 months and then decreased regularly. Nasal contact frequencies showed less variation during the development of young compared to that of mothers. The most striking changes were found in the location of such nasal contacts: during the gathering stage, naso-nasal contacts towards mother were predominant, then 677</page><page sequence="36">678 VOLUME 90 the contacts were preferentially established on the back and the ano-urogenital region of the mother. Ano-urogenital marking appeared at 4 months and increased in frequency until the 14th month. In conclusion, there appeared to be an adaptation of the animals communication systems in relation to their social environment. During the "social phase" (gathering stage) vocal and direct olfactory commu- nications were predominant. The transition to a solitary phase induced a decrease of the use of these two communication systems and an increase in the frequency in which indirect olfactory communication was used. These results are analysed from a phylogenetic perspective in relation to socialization. Behaviour Vol. 90 (1984) pp. 302-325 VOCAL MIMICRY IN STARLINGS ANDREW M. HINDMARSH Edward Grey Institute of Field Ornithology, Oxford, England Starlings imitate a variety of avian species and have a repertoire of about 15-20 distinct imitations. They also imitate a few sounds other than those of wild birds. The calls of abundant species, calls that are simple in frequency structure and calls that show little amplitude modulation are preferentially imitated. There are local dialects of mimicked sounds. These results are discussed in relation to possible functional explanations of vocal mimicry. Explanations which involve the deceit of other birds are rejected. It is concluded that the understanding of vocal mimicry is probably not distinct from the understanding of the rest of the song.</page><page sequence="37">VOLUME 91 679 Behaviour Vol. 91 (1984) pp. 1-23 AGGRESSION, COPULATION, AND DIFFERENTIAL REPRODUCTION OF DEER MICE (PEROMYSCUS MANICULATUS) IN A SEMI-NATURAL ENCLOSURE DONALD A. DEWSBURY Department of Psychology, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida 32611, U.S.A. This study was designed to analyze the interactions of priority of residence, strain, dominance, male capacity, and sperm competition in relation to aggression, copulation, and differential reproduction in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). Males were wild-type or blonde mutants; females were of the recessive blonde phenotype. There were 20 replicates of a procedure entailing 7-day runs. One male was introduced into a semi-natural enclosure on Day 1 and the second male on Day 3. Their interactions were sampled on Days 3-7. In addition, two estrous females were introduced for tests on Day 5 and 6. In the absence of females, levels of male-male aggression were lower than in their presence. Priority of residence led to increased levels of chasing by males. Limitations on male capacity were revealed as decreased numbers of ejaculations and chases in the second of the two tests with females. Dominance was established in 13 of the 20 runs; copulation occurred in 28 of the 41 tests. Dominant males achieved more ejaculations than subordinates. Males copulated with both females on 20 of 41 occasions, with most partner changes (but smaller percentage per opportunity) occurring within ejaculatory series. Females copulated on 44 of the 82 occasions and delivered a total of 30 litters. Determinants of differential reproduction were diffuse.

H3C 3P8, Canada Sixteen populations, each of four male and four female green swordtail fish, were observed in 54 litre tanks separated into two unequal volumes by a partition allowing swimming from one area to another only at the surface. Each population was observed on 2-4 occasions, making a combined total of 50 observation periods of 2 hours each. Chase-right orders, spatial positions as well as several agonistic and epigamic behaviour units were noted during each period of observation. Males and females apparently form distinct hierarchies which are perfectly linear and transitive in 68% and 42% of the cases respectively. Some dominance structures are incomplete, but no intransitivity is noted. Alpha males are much more aggressive than their isosexual subordinates. In females, the frequency of aggressive behaviour appears to be more proportional to the social rank of the initiator, but the number of chases received from other females is the best indicator of rank in the female hierarchies. Alpha males are responsible for 80% of all sexual activity and have privilege to behaviour leading to insemination with a high probability in 85% of the case. Females are not courted according to their position in the female hierarchy, nor to their size. In the two-compartment situation of the present study, which allowed spacing-out and visual isolation of the individuals, the alpha males occupied the larger area of the aquarium in the company of the four females while the three subordinate males were restricted to the smaller area, unaccompanied by any females. This spacing-out pattern emerged with neat regularity from the data and was apparently caused and maintained by aggressive behaviour, especially by charges, initiated by the alpha male toward male rivals. However, it is not evident that the behaviour of the alpha male should be neatly qualified as territorial defence, since specific-area-linked dominance was never realized in the present study. The social scheme most readily applicable to the present social and spatial organization is the "one male to several females" system or monarchistic male hierarchy, in which one male becomes very dominant over the others, occupies the larger area and is also the sole individual to court the females and to attempt insemination (haremic). These results support the sociobiological theorem that to dominate is to have priority of access to the necessities of life and reproduction.</page><page sequence="38">680 VOLUME 91 Behaviour Vol. 91 (1984) pp. 61-77 HELPERS(?) AT THE NEST IN THE MONGOLIAN GERBIL, MERIONES UNGUICULATUS MALCOLM C. OSTERMEYER and ROBERT W. ELWOOD Department of Zoology, The Queen's University of Belfast, Belfast, U.K. Mongolian gerbil families were observed in artificial burrow systems and the effects of the presence of juveniles and the number of 'underground' nest areas were noted. Juveniles interacted with infants and increased their time in the maternal nest during the rearing of the infants as did the fathers. Parents spent less time self-grooming and licking the infants if juveniles were present. The fathers appeared to act paternally mainly towards the juveniles but also supplied the "underground" area with food. These observations were congruent with the prediction that juveniles act as helpers at the nest. A second experiment, however, indicated that juveniles retarded the development of the infants, possibly by stealing milk. The parents appeared to minimise the detrimental effects that juveniles had on the development of the infants and yet ensured that the juveniles remain within the family group until they were old enough to fend for themselves. The number of nest areas had little effect on these social interactions. Behaviour Vol. 91 (1984) pp. 78-92 RECOGNITION OF CONSPECIFICS AND SEX BY TERRITORIAL MALES OF THE SOCIAL WASP POLISTES FUSCATUS (HYMENOPTERA: VESPIDAE) DAVID C. POST and ROBERT L. JEANNE Department of Entomology, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin, 53706, U.S.A. Territorial males of Polistesfuscatus (subspecies variatus) respond to intruders with a chain of behavior of increasing intensity as follows: (1) no reaction, (2) orient, (3) pursue, (4) grasp, and (5) either grapple (with male intruders) or attempt copulation (with females). In the laboratory test object combining different visual, chemical, and behavioral stimuli were tethered and waved in front of perched territorial males to determine the role of each in eliciting a male response. All test objects elicited an orient response. The overall color or contrast with the background and shape of the test object had little effect on male response. The black and yellow banded coloration characteristic of conspecifics released pursuit and grasping behavior, while chemical cues in combination with the banded coloration released grasping and grappling or attempt copulation. Recognition of sex was based on chemical cues and not on the sexually dichromic coloration. From this and previous studies we conclude that the black and yellow banded coloration of conspecifics is the most important visual stimulus for long-range attraction (&gt; 15 cm) of males, while at close-range or on contact a cuticular surface pheromone and a sex pheromone from the venom are important in the recognition of conspecifics and for discrimination between the sexes. Behaviour Vol. 91 (1984) pp. 93-114 COURTSHIP SEQUENCES AND ETHOLOGICAL ISOLATION IN TWO SPECIES OF SUNFISH (LEPOMIS SPP) AND THEIR HYBRIDS SUSAN E. CLARKE, PATRICK W. COLGAN and NIGEL P. LESTER Department of Biology, Queen's University at Kingston, Ontario, K7L 3N6, Canada The role of courtship behaviour in ethological isolation was studied by analysing courtship sequences between different crosses of pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus), bluegill (L. macrochirus), and their hybrid sunfish. Crosses were established in large laboratory tanks, under an artificially advanced photoperiod and temperature regime, and in outside pools. Male-female interactions were filmed and videotaped. In the field, underwater films of naturally occurring courtship and spawning were taken. A behavioural repertoire was described and the data converted to pairs of male and female acts (dyads). Two contexts were distinguished (spawn and nonspawn) depending on whether courtship led to spawning or not. Several methods of analysis were used. Multidimensional contingency table analysis with factors of preceding act, following act, and cross, enabled examination of the dependence of the response of any individual (sex or species) upon the species of partner. Multidimensional Scaling of the crosses, based on a chi-square measure of overall dissimilarity for each context, revealed the relative proximities among the different interspecific and hybrid crosses and the parentals. The results generally agreed well with those produced by a clustering technique.</page><page sequence="39">VOLUME 91 681 The conclusions are: (1) The differences between the courtship and spawning behaviour of the parentals are evidence for a behavioural isolating mechanism. (2) Interspecific and hybrid crosses tend to be intermediate to parentals. (3) Courting and spawning behaviour is different in the laboratory and field environments. (4) Hybrids likely originate from crosses of males bluegills and female pumpkinseeds. Behaviour Vol. 91 (1984) pp. 115-127 MEASURING THE STRENGTH OF SOCIAL BONDS: EXPERIMENTS WITH HAND-REARED GOSLINGS (ANSER INDICUS) J. LAMPRECHT Max-Planck-Institut fur Verhaltensphysiologie, D-8131 Seewiesen, F.R.G. Allogrooming, dueting and other behaviours observed only between pair or group members are often said to reinforce or strengthen social bonds, yet the strength of these bonds was not measured independently. 'Bond strength' should reflect the stability of an attachment relationship and thus the probability of a permanent separation from the partner. The latter is a function of opportunity or external force as well as of an internal 'divorce tendency'. Only the divorce tendency is inversely related to that motivational variable which can be called 'bond strength'. To find a behavioural measure of individual divorce tendency, the relationship of hand-reared bar-headed goslings (Anser indicus) to their human foster parents was investigated in four experiments. The following results were obtained: (1) The subjects (n = 18) significantly preferred their own, familiar foster parent (Hp) to a less familiar person (Hu). (2) This was also true when the Hu was the preferred Hp of another group of goslings, indicating that familiarity and not his suitability as a 'goose parent' is the relevant factor. (3) Alone with one person on a lawn, all goslings (n = 12) also maintained proximity when this was an Hu, indicating a bond to him also. Median distances maintained to Hp and Hu did not differ significantly, and were therefore no indicators of a gosling's preference. But the distress calling rate was significantly higher and the feeding rate significantly lower when a gosling was with an Hu than when with its Hp. (4) Distress calling rate in the presence of a stationary person was also a good indicator of a gosling's (n = 15) tendency to leave him and follow a slowly moving stranger. Approaches towards the stranger were significantly longer when the stationary person was an Hu than when it was the Hp. The amount of distress calling in the presence of an Hu was positively correlated (p &amp;lt; 0.01) with the distance that the subjects later moved towards the stranger. The distress calling rate therefore is a good relative measure of a gosling's tendency to abandon a particular object, this tendency reflecting what we may call the strength of a bond or attachment. Behaviour Vol. 91 (1984) pp. 128-145 VOCAL COMMUNICATION IN A NEOTROPICAL TREEFROG, HYLA EBRACCATA: AGGRESSIVE CALLS KENTWOOD D. WELLS and JOSHUA J. SCHWARTZ Biological Sciences Group, The University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut 06268, U.S.A. We studied the aggressive calls of Hyla ebraccata in Panama by recording natural interactions in the field and by playing recordings of natural and synthetic calls to males. Aggressive calls of this species had higher pulse repetition rates than advertisement calls and often were much longer. Aggressive calls also were much more variable in introductory note duration, pulse rate, rise time, and the number and structure of click notes. Pulse repetition rate was negatively correlated with the duration of the introductory note, as were the number of click notes in the call and the number of pulse in each click. In natural encounters, the duration of introductory notes increased as the distance between interacting males decreased. Males gave aggressive calls in response to playbacks of both advertisement and aggressive calls, but aggressive calls were much more effective in eliciting such responses. The proportion of aggressive calls and the duration of introductory notes generally increased with increasing playback intensity. Playbacks of synthetic calls which varied in pulse repetition rate and rise time showed that a high pulse repetition rate was the most important feature in eliciting aggressive responses from males, but rise time also was important when calls had fast pulse rates. The aggressive calls of this species appear to be a graded signaling system, the first to be documented in amphibians.</page><page sequence="40">682 VOLUME 91 Behaviour Vol.91 (1984) pp. 146-189 LOUD CALLS OF THE GIBBON (HYLOBATES LAR): REPERTOIRE, ORGANISATION AND CONTEXT JEREMY J. RAEMAEKERS, PATRICIA M. RAEMAEKERS and ELLIOTT H. HAIMOFF Dept. of Biology, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand and Sub-dept. of Veterinary Anatomy, Cambridge University, Cambridge, U.K. We describe and illustrate with sonograms the loud calls of a monogamous, territorial ape, the lar gibbon (Hylobates lar). We attempt an overview of its repertoire of loud calls, their organisation, contexts and functions. The description is based on a two year study of a wild population in Khao Yai National Park, Thailand. We distinguish seven classes of call bout: male solo, male dispute calls, female solo, normal duet by bonded pair, ooaa duet (similar to normal duet, but more infectious to other groups), disturbed calls and contact calls. The organisation of the normal duet is described in detail, showing the coordination of the sexes, the development of the male part through the call bout, and the presence of individual and pair differences. The discussion considers the possible functions of duets, of male solos, and of disturbed calls given in reaction to man. Behaviour Vol. 91 (1984) pp. 190-203 OBSERVATIONS ON VOCALIZATION OF EWES AND LAMBS IN THE FIELD ELIZABETH SHILLITO WALSER, EUROF WALTERS and JUDY ELLISON Institute of Animal Physiology, Babraham, Cambridge, CB2 4AT England Dalesbred, Jacob and Soay ewes were observed with their lambs in the field for 3 months, to record when vocalizations occurred and the subsequent behavioural interactions. Soay ewes bleated and moved towards their lambs more than the Dalesbred and Jacob ewes, and were the least vocal in response to the lamb's bleats. The Soay lambs had the lowest proportion of vocal responses without movements to the ewe's bleats, but were more likely to bleat themselves and run to their dam, than the Dalesbred and Jacob lambs. They also had a low proportion of results in the category 'No response'. Dalesbred ewes bleated in reply to their lamb's bleats without moving toward the lambs, more than the other breeds. The Dalesbred lambs bleated and ran to the ewes in response to the ewe bleats more than the Jacob and Soay lambs, and the proportion of this response increased with age. The Jacob ewes and lambs had the highest incidence of 'no response' recorded to their vocalization. These results are discussed in relation to experimental findings on vocalizations in sheep, and it is suggested that domestication has tended to increase the amount of bleating by sheep. Behaviour Vol. 91 (1984) pp. 204-228 VISUAL AND ACOUSTIC DISPLAY IN UCA MORDAX AND U. BURGERSI, SIBLING SPECIES OF NEOTROPICAL FIDDLER CRABS. II. VIBRATION SIGNALS HEINRICH-OTTO VON HAGEN Fachbereich Biologie, Zoologie, Philipps-Universitat, Marburg/Lahn, B.R.D. The sibling species of fiddler crabs, Uca mordax and U. burgersi, which are very similar in respect to morphology and many traits of their waving display (see part I of this study), were studied bioacoustically in Trinidad (W.I.). When recording their vibration signals (mainly in the laboratory) it was, at the same time, possible to directly observe the animals' underground activities. The dominant vibration signals of the two species were found to be extremely different; males of U. mor- dax emit rapping sounds ("drumwhirls") by ambulatory percussion, whereas males of U. burgersi produce "howling" sounds (with a varying number of harmonics) by cheliped convulsion, i.e. inconspicuous quiv- ering movements of this appendage. Similar interspecific differences exist in the fainter vibration signals of females. Each of the two species is capable of producing other signals in addition to the prevalent ones mentioned: U. mordax can emit cheliped vibrations as well (though percussive ones) and U. burgersi can also produce ambulatory "drumwhirls". From these and other basic similarities and from comparisons with recordings of burgersi sounds from Colombia and allopatric populations in Florida, the common starting-point and the different evolutionary</page><page sequence="41">VOLUME 91 683 pathways leading to the two species-specific termini of acoustic display are reconstructed. The extreme differences that were found for the sympatric situation in Trinidad are regarded as an example of character displacement. Apparently, the acoustic communication system of these crabs is much more affected by character displacement than the visual one. Behaviour Vol. 91 (1984) pp. 229-244 ALTERNATIVE MATING STRATEGIES IN THE MONGOLIAN GERBIL GRETA AGREN Department of Zoology, University of Stockholm, S-106 91 Stockholm, Sweden 1. In previous enclosure studies female Mongolian gerbils were found to trespass into strange territories on oestrous days and mate with the neighbouring males, although they lived in stable territorial pairs or family-groups (AGREN, 1976, 1983, 1984). The females mated with their social partners as well. 2. A comparable 'unfaithful' behaviour in females in oestrous was observed in a laboratory choice-test (AGREN &amp; MEYERSON, 1977). 3. A mating-preference for non-siblings has been demonstrated in enclosure as well as laboratory studies (AGREN, 1983). 4. In the present enclosure studies four females of one family consistently trespassed in oestrous, while three females in a second family did not. Only these latter females mated within their own social group, i.e. the two daughters incestuously. 5. When two females and three males of each of these same families were placed into a new enclosure only cross family pairs formed. 6. In a laboratory experiment 12 out of 18 pairliving females gave birth to, and raised their litter, sired by a strange male, when replaced into the cage of the familiar male the day following oestrous. The cage mate was prevented from copulations by a wire-mesh during 10 days following the insemination by the strange male. These results indicate that an 'unfaithful' female may be reproductively successful. 7. The observations of the unfaithful behaviour in the females are suggestive of an alternative mating strategy to monogamy in females beneficial under high population densities. This strategy would result in avoidance of inbreeding, low migration costs, and increased chances for winter-survival. Behaviour Vol. 91 (1984) pp. 245-262 ECOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS ON THE SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT OF VERVET MONKEYS P.C. LEE Sub.-Dept. of Animal Behaviour, High St., Madingley, Cambridge, CB3 8AA, England 1. Immature animals from three social groups of vervet monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops) living in adjacent territories were observed in Amboseli National Park, Kenya. Measures of diets and food densities suggested that food quality and distribution differed both between the groups and between the dry and wet seasons, such that the dry season was a period of low food quality, and Group A had the lowest food density. 2. Seasonal differences in dietary quality and the time spent feeding produced seasonal differences in the rates of high energy social interactions: play, aggression, and competition. 3. Differences between groups in food availability and quality affected rates of social interactions such that Group A generally had the lowest frequency of interactions. Both between groups and between seasons, low food quality reduced the frequency of interactions and increased the time spent feeding. 4. Play rates were shown to be highly responsive to the energy estimated to be available from the diet during the different seasons such that play was eliminated from the immature social repertoire during the stressful dry season. 5. The time course of weaning also appeared to be influenced by seasonal and intergroup differences in habitat. Few females gave birth in consecutive years, and many suckled their infants into the second year of life. Stressed females weaned infants earlier. It is suggested that prolonged investment is a response to environmental variation and plays an important role in female reproductive strategies. 6. It is suggested that the immatures in these groups maximised the time and energy available for different types of social interactions in a different way in each season and in the different groups. This social flexibility may be viewed as part of an adaptive complex of behaviour during the immature stage of a life history.</page><page sequence="42">684 VOLUME 91 Behaviour Vol. 91 (1984) pp. 263-285 THE INFLUENCE OF SOCIAL RELATIONS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF SPECIES RECOGNITION IN ZEBRA FINCH MALES CAREL TEN CATE Zoological Laboratory, University of Groningen, P.O. Box 14, 9750 AA Haren, The Netherlands The influence of social relations on the development of species recognition ('sexual imprinting') in zebra finch (Z) males was examined. This was done with Z males raised by mixed pairs of Z and Bengalese finches (B)(dZyB or yZcB). During rearing, the behaviour of parents and sibling towards the young Z males was measured. Z males raised by mixed pairs were usually exposed to more parental behaviour, contact behaviour and aggression by Z (parent and sibling) than by B. These males also preferred a Z over a B female later on, which might be a consequence of differences in behavioural interaction with Z and B. In a series of experiments the amount of different behaviour patterns shown by the Z parents towards young Z males was decreased. This led to a shift from Z to B in the later preference of these males, in spite of the fact that 'visual exposure' to Z was maintained as much as possible. Influence of the sibling was examined by comparing the preference of Z males raised with a B sibling with that of Z males raised with a conspecific sibling. The effect of the sibling on the later preference, if any, appeared to be marginal to that of the parents. Preference differed between males raised by yZdfB pairs and males raised by cZyB pairs, the latter being more B directed. Experiments indicate that this difference is most likely due to lack of familiarity with female Z characteristics in males raised by dZyB pairs. The results strongly suggest that behavioural interactions between a young Z male and other birds, rather than visual exposure only, influence the later preference of this male. Several mechanisms which might underlie this effect on the developmental process are discussed. No initial preference for Z characteristics has to be assumed to explain that Z males raised by mixed pairs normally develop a Z directed preference. Behaviour Vol. 91 (1984) pp. 286-293 SPATIAL PROXIMITY BETWEEN ALLIES: A TERRITORIAL SIGNAL TESTED IN THE MONOGAMOUS DUET SINGER COSSYPHA HEUGLINI HENRIKE HULTSCH and DIETMAR TODT Abt. Verhaltensbiologie, Inst. f. Allg. Zoologie, Freie Universitat Berlin, Germany In bird species in which territories are defended by both sexes, 'showing up together' is a widespread behaviour of mated individuals. To test whether the spatial proximity of simultaneously appearing mates would have a territorial signal function we presented robin chats (Cossypha heuglini H.) to mounts of conspecifics placed within their territories, Experimental variables were (1) distance between mounts, and (2) number of mounts. Results: Compared to single mount presentations, residents did not show significant differences in agonistic approaches towards the 'intruders', when mounts were positioned with a distance of 3-6 m to each other (spaced presentations). In contrast, when the distance between mounts was 0.3-0.6 m, (close presentations, simulating the close perching of mates) residents approached them significantly less often and less close (Tables I and 2). Such approach and attack inhibitions were not stronger when three or four mounts were offered instead of two. Residental pairs spent more time in non-vocal display behaviours than did single residents (Table 3). During playback of conspecific song after having been presented to a mount test, the residents' responses appeared to be influenced by whether they had received a spaced or a close mount test before. Our results have demonstrated the significance of visual pair recognition through clues from spatial proximity of birds. As with the vocal duet displays, the close perching of pair members may function in signalling cooperation during territorial confrontation with conspecifics.</page><page sequence="43">VOLUME 91 685 Behaviour Vol. 91 (1984) pp. 294-31 1 INFORMATION EXPLOITATION BY DOWNY WOODPECKERS IN MIXED-SPECIES FLOCKS KIMBERLY A. SULLIVAN Institute of Animal Behavior, Rutgers University 101 Warren Street, Newark, N.J. 07102 U.S.A. Downy woodpeckers (Picoides pubescens) benefit from foraging in mixed-species winter flocks by de- creasing their vigilance level and increasing their feeding rate. I investigated one mechanism, auditory cues, downy woodpeckers use to obtain information on the presence of other flock members and potential predators. Experiments with predator models and with recorded alarm calls and contact calls from flock members yielded the following results. Downy woodpeckers use the contact calls of other flock mem- bers to assess the presence of flocks members. Woodpeckers foraging alone but with the recorded contact calls of flock members showed lower vigilance levels and higher feeding rates than woodpeckers foraging alone with no recordings or with the control recordings. Woodpeckers respond to the other species' alarm calls as an indication of potential predators and also to their contact calls as an all clear signal afterwards. Downy woodpeckers decreased their vigilance levels and resumed foraging faster when the contact calls followed the presentation of predator models or alarm calls than when these were presented alone. Behaviour Vol. 91 (1984) pp. 312-322 EXTRA-TERRITORIAL MOVEMENTS OF A PERENNIALLY TERRITORIAL DAMSELFISH, EUPOMACENTRUS DORSOPUNICANS POEY PAUL JON BARTELS Department of Zoology, University of the West Indies, Kingston, Jamaica 1. Dusky damselfish, Eupomacentrus dorsopunicans spend the majority of their time in very small, peren- nial territories but long forays to other territories are common. 2. Adults living on discrete habitats often forayed to continuous habitats, and were lost more frequently during a six month census. 3. Continuous habitat occupants participated in more courtship activity. 4. Following experimental habitat disruption the number of forays increased prior to the establishment of new territories, thus demonstrating that foraying is associated with territorial reestablishment. 5. Territorial shifts are essential for perennially territorial individuals in inferior habitats, and foraying is apparently a territorial monitoring mechanism. Presumably, forays optimally time territorial shifts and reduce their inherent costs.</page><page sequence="44">686 VOLUME 92 Behaviour Vol.92 (1985) pp. 1-8 THE INACTIVITY OF ANIMALS: INFLUENCE OF STOCHASTICITY AND PREY SIZE WILLIAM J. SUTHERLAND and DORIAN MOSS Edward Grey Institute of Field Ornithology, Department of Zoology, Oxford University, England, and Institute of Terrestrial Ecology, Bangor Research Station, Bangor, Wales As a consequence of prey capture being partly dependent upon chance, each individual may usually spend much of the day inactive even if the population is limited by its food supply. This applies particularly to species that eat large prey and thus experience considerable day-to-day variation in intake which restricts them to relatively rich habitats. Food will be found easily on most days and little time need be spent hunting although, occasionally, they will be unlucky and, despite searching all day, risk starvation. Predators of small prey can survive in environments that provide barely sufficient food as they experience little variation in intake: but they need to search all day to sustain themselves. Behaviour Vol. 92 (1985) pp. 9-21 TWO DIFFERENT DECISION-MAKING SYSTEMS IN RECRUITMENT TO FOOD IN ANT SOCIETIES KLAUS JAFFE, GLORIA VILLEGAS, OMAR COLMENARES, HELENA PUCHE, NELSON A. ZABALA, MARIA I. ALVAREZ, JOSE G. NAVARRO and ENEIDA PINO Departamento de Biologia de Organismos, Universidad Sim6n Bolfvar, Apartado 80659, Caracas 1080, Venezuela Two different decision-making systems had been proposed for the regulation of chemical mass recruitment in ants. In the system proposed for Atta cephalotes, recruitment to food sources is initiated by few ants. They provide the colony with all the information needed in order to determine the number of ants required at the food source. In the system proposed for Solenopsis saevissima workers regulate recruitment by means of a system in which the information that reaches to colony is the total sum of the partial contributions given by those ants which responded after encountering the food. The differences between both systems were worked out (Table 1) and experiments were designed in order to find out which of the systems were used by 7 different ant species. Experiments testing indirectly the amount of pheromone secreted on the trail (Table 2) show that indeed both decision-making systems exist in nature. Simpler experiments, based on the kinetics of the recruitment to food (Table 3) show that the Myrmicinae of the tribe Attini: A. cephalotes, Acromyrmex landolti, and Trachymyrmex urichi were the only ones to use the A. cephalotes system. The Myrmicinae Solenopsis geminata and Crematogaster sumichrasti, and the Dolichoderinae Conomyrma sp. and Azteca sp. use the S. saevissima system. No correlation exists between the degree of phylogenetic development of the recruitment system used by the species and the decision-making system employed. Some implications of the use of these two systems by ants in relation to all theoretically possible optimal decision-making systems are discussed. Behaviour Vol. 92 (1985) pp. 22-38 SIZE ASSESSMENT AND CUES: STUDIES OF HERMIT CRAB CONTESTS SUSAN J. NEIL Department of Zoology, Queen's University of Belfast, Belfast BT7 INN, Northern Ireland The agonistic behaviour of pairs of hermit crabs (Pagurus bernhardus) was observed in the laboratory. It was found that relative size was a reliable predictor of the outcome of a contest only when the crabs differed by at least 100% in weight. However, weight differences of 10 to 30% could be sufficient to cause differences in behaviour. It was concluded from this that whereas crabs can accurately assess small differences in weight, these differences may not be sufficient to reliably determine the outcome of contents. Other factors affecting RHP are relevant at intermediate size differences. Two possible cues for size assessment were tested: the size of the major cheliped and the size of the opponent's shell. The presence and size of the major cheliped were found to have a strong effect on contest initiation and outcome, and therefore this is likely to be a cue used in RHP assessment. The major</page><page sequence="45">VOLUME 92 687 cheliped was also found to play an important part in defensive behaviour, crabs lacking this appendage being less successful in defending their shells from attack. However, the apparent size of the opponent's shell did not seem to affect the initiation or outcome of contests. Thus it seems that crabs assess their opponents independently of the shells they occupy. It is concluded that large size differences are sufficient to decide contests. For smaller size differences other factors of RHP are important, and can override size differences. There is no evidence indicating that the defending crab can assess the quality of its opponent's shell and make contest decisions based on this evidence. These data do not support the negotiation hypothesis. Behaviour Vol. 92 (1985) pp. 39-58 THE SOCIAL FOOD-FLOW WITHIN THE COLONY OF A STINGLESS BEE, MELIPONA FAVOSA (F.) MARINUS J. SOMMEIJER, LUC L.M. DE BRUIJN and CEES VAN DE GUCHTE Laboratory of Comparative Physiology, University of Utrecht, Jan van Galenstraat 40, 3572 LA Utrecht, The Netherlands Trophallaxis in workers of stingless bees was studied in colonies of Melipona favosa with marked in- dividuals. In the brood area of the nest all trophallactic interactions are initiated by the soliciting bee, whereas spontaneous offerings occur particularly near the nest exit. The trophallactic network within the colony does not represent an open system that leads to even distribution. The cell-provisioning bees ob- tain food, mainly from other bees. Since cell-provisioning is strongly age-dependent, the trophallactic benefit changes strongly according to the age of the bees. The bees that discharge on a particular day are not involved in the pollen uptake from food pots on that day. The dischargers probably obtain trophal- lactically a liquid food suspension with a high pollen content, which they subsequently regurgitate into the brood cells. The dischargers also perform active food solicitations with other bees immediately after they have discharged during the progress of the provisioning of a cell. For this they often depart quickly from the cell that is being filled. We assume that their withdrawal from the cell vicinity enhances their chances to meet quickly bees that are less reluctant than the other dischargers nearby to donate food to them. This behavior sometimes enables discharges to perform subsequent regurgitations in the same cell. Behaviour Vol. 92 (1985) pp. 59-96 GIBBON SONG DUETS AND INTERGROUP SPACING JOHN C. MITANI Department of Anthropology, University of California, Davis, Calif. 95616 U.S.A. Mated adult pairs of Bornean gibbons (Hylobates muelleri) occupy exclusive site-specific ranges and engage in frequent bouts of interactive song duets. The role song duets play in mediating spacing among gibbon groups was investigated through naturalistic observations and experimental playbacks of recorded duets. Naturalistic observations indicate that song duets are audible over long distances. Long distance transmis- sion of duets may be facilitated by singing at certain times and locations. Duets are delivered primarily during early moming hours and from the higher portions of the tree canopy. Some acoustic properties of duets and song duet redundancy may also aid their propagation over long distances. Since an intergroup spacing signal must be transmitted over considerable distances, these observations imply that song duets perform a spacing function. The situations in which duets occur and responses to them support the intergroup spacing hypothesis. The majority of naturally occurring duets are either spontaneously emitted or sung interactively with neighboring groups. A small sample of responses to duets during intergroup encounters suggests that over short distances along range boundaries, duets are used as agonistic displays to maintain normal spacing pattems between groups. Experimental playbacks of recorded duets typically elicit vocal and spatial responses. Orientation toward the speaker, alarm vocalizations, brachiation displays, duetting an group movement follow duet playbacks. Control playbacks of adult male orangutan long calls and no sound indicate that these responses are specific to song duets. Some sex differences in response to duets are apparent. Female gibbons initiate postplayback movements and vocal responses more often than males. Responses to duet playbacks also vary as a function of playback location. Playbacks from the interior of a gibbon's range are followed by approaches and duets. Duets played back from a gibbon's range boundary regularly elicit only a duetting response. Duets played back from neighbor's ranges rarely result in approaches or duets. Movements</page><page sequence="46">688 VOLUME 92 following playbacks indicate that duets perform different functions depending on the location from which they are delivered. Duets normally maintain distances between groups, but they can lead to distance reduction if range integrity is threatened. Spatial variations in responses to duet playbacks suggest that Bomean gibbons maintain their exclusive ranges by altering their agonistic responses to conspecific groups at different locations. Playback proximity to important food sources or sleeping sites appears to have little effect on responses. In contrast, some evidence shows that spatial variations in responses may be caused by differential familiarity with simulated encounter sites. Duet playbacks apparently affect calling and ranging patterns over a short and long term. Time spent duetting and daily path length increase on days when playbacks are given from the center of gibbon ranges and on days following these playbacks. Gibbons increase duetting time on days when playbacks are administered from their range boundary. Repeated simulated interactions over time may account for an observed increase in the mean duration of duet bouts during the course of this study. These changes in calling and ranging are discussed with regard to the intergroup spacing function of duets. Behaviour Vol.92 (1985) pp.97-111 THE ENERGETICS OF FEEDING TERRITORIALITY IN JUVENILE COHO SALMON (ONCORHYNCHUS KJSUTCH) K.J. PUCKETT and L.M. DILL Department of Biological Sciences, Simon Fraser University, Bumaby, B.C. Canada V5A 1S6 1. A foraging time budget was developed for territorial, nonterritorial, and floater fish. Territorial fish spend 76% of total time at the station, 3% free swimming, 13% feeding, and 5% in agonistic activity. Floaters spend 18% of their time stationary swimming, 54% free swimming, 10% feeding, and 10% in agonistic activity. Nonterritorial fish spend 50% of their time stationary swimming, 43% free swimming, 2% feeding, and 3% in agonistic activity. 2. Stationary swimming tailbeat frequency for the floater (4.3) is significantly higher than for the territorial fish (3.6). The floater flight tailbeat frequency (8.2) is significantly higher than the territorial chase tailbeat frequency (6.9). Normal feed tailbeat frequencies are similar for all fish groups. Nonterritorial fish tend to move slowly (tailbeat frequency = 3.3) for all activities except normal feed. 3. The total activity budgets for territorial, floater, and nonterritorial fish are 1199, 1318, and 910 cal/kg/hr, respectively. The territorial fish uses 91 % as many calories as the floater fish and the nonterritorial fish utilizes 76% of the territorial budget. 4. Total agonistic costs represent 12 and 14% of the territorial and floater dish activity budgets, respectively. 5. The costs per feeding motion for the territorial, floater, and nonterritorial fish are 4.03, 4.91, 10.1 cal/motion, respectively. 6. The territorial fish has a net energy intake advantage over the floater, and probably over the nonterritorial fish, due to 1) reduced search costs, 2) reduced prey pursuit costs, and 3) reduced agonistic activity costs. Behaviour Vol. 92 (1985) pp. 112-128 SEXUAL SELECTION IN THE SPRING PEEPER, HYLA CRUCIFER (AMPHIBIA, ANURA): ROLE OF THE ADVERTISEMENT CALL DON C. FORESTER and RICHARD CZARNOWSKY Biological Sciences/Institute of Animal Behavior, Towson State University, Towson, Maryland 21204 U.S.A. 1. The advertisement call of the spring peeper exhibits significant variation in each of the four parameters examined: intensity, duration, frequency, repetition rate. 2. In playback experiments involving calls differing in a single parameter, females exhibited preference for loud calls, calls with a rapid repetition rate and low frequency calls. 3. Although we had hypothesized that females would prefer long calls to short calls, they did not. We attribute this lack of preference to unanticipated differences in the sound envelope of the two experimental calls. 4. Non-random choice by females during playback experiments may have been in response to the con- spicuousness of the male call, or to encoded clues pertaining to male fitness. 5. Call repetition rate is positively correlated with body size (snout-vent length) while frequency is nega- tively correlated.</page><page sequence="47">VOLUME 92 689 6. Anuran growth is thought to be indeterminate, so that larger males are typically older males. As a consequence of having survived longer, large males may be more fit. 7. Since females exhibited a preference for call parameters which were correlated with body size, we had anticipated that large males would experience differential mating success in nature. A comparison of amplexed and non-amplexed males over a three year period revealed no intergroup size difference. 8. We conclude that while females may select calls indicative of size, and perhaps fitness, during laboratory trials, such choices are likely more difficult in an active breeding congregation where acoustical interference and competition may tend to obscure call variation. 9. Finally we report the presence of small, non-calling satellite males and suggest that their success as sexual parasites may have influenced the size relationship between amplexed and non-amplexed males in our study. Behaviour Vol. 92 (1985) pp. 129-145 MAKING THE DECISION TO CONTINUE THE FIGHT OR TO FLEE AN ANALYSIS OF CONTESTS BETWEEN MALE HAPLOCHROMIS BURTONI (PISCES) HANS-JOACHIM MOSLER Department of Ethology and Wildlife Research, Institute of Zoology, University of Zurich, Switzerland Males of Haplochromis burtoni have ritualized fights with physical contact and they assess the relative persistence of their opponents by their reactions, following their own behavior patterns. For this the fighter has to know which reactions have a typical winner or loser meaning and thus which reactions could point at more or less persistence. I evaluated the meanings out of a preliminary data sample of 27 fights by calculating information values, with a formula developed, for each reaction in each fighting stage. In general, it seems that Displaying Long, that is, being Rammed for a long time has a typical winner meaning, indicating more persistence. The hypothetical reactions were tested with a second sample. In 20 out of 23 fights the number of typical winner reactions of the winner is greater, up to the last fighting stage. Because this difference is only in the last fighting stage significant, I postulated a "Critical Fighting Stage". The fighter comes into this stage when he feels a little weariness. From this stage on, and not before, his assessment of his opponent should become relevant for him. A fighter with this strategy has three advantages: 1. Each bluff will be ineffective if it does not happen in the "Critical Fighting Stage". Therefore, a fighter should by no means show he is in this stage. 2. A fighter cannot give any information about how long he will fight, because he does not know it himself. 3. He does not know it himself because he adapts his persistence to the fighting of his opponent. The results brought the following new aspects to sociobiological hypotheses: 1. A bimodal function of the ESS nearly agreed with the frequency distribution of the duration of 50 fights. I tried to describe the suitable penalty function on the basis of my observations. 2. I found that the assessment improved with the fighting stages. Therefore, the information acquired in each stage is not constant. 3. The concept of the "Critical Fighting Stage" allows for the best adaptation of a fighter's persistence to the fighting of his opponent. I referred to the improvements of the applied method compared with other investigations of fight-analysis. The method of determining typical behavior patterns can be applied generally for evaluating the relative values of two or more dependent events, in a certain context for a subsequent structure. For example, the relative contribution of social patterns might be evaluated with this method.

AFTON Delta Waterfowl Research Station, Portage la Prairie, Manitoba, Canada; and Department of Biology, Institute for Ecological Studies, University of North Dakota, Grand Forks, U.S.A. I presented evidence that sperm transfer can occur during forced copulation (FC) under natural conditions, and tested predictions of the fertilization strategy hypothesis, with field data from a marked population of lesser scaup breeding in southwestern Manitoba. As predicted, males directed FC attempts at fertilizable females and seemingly had tactics that increased their effectiveness in inseminating such females. Males selected older females (the more productive) when attempting FCs in 1 year of the study. FC rates</page><page sequence="48">690 VOLUME 92 were highest in the morning when chances of successful fertilization were probably highest. FC rates were positively correlated with annual variations in female reproductive effort and performance, but the exact nature of the relationship requires further study. Mate-and nonmate-defense by males and other behaviours which probably function as anti-cuckoldry tactics were observed. Contrary to BARASH'S (1977a) prediction, paired males attempted FCs more frequently than did unpaired males. Although pair formation through mate-switches is probably a more profitable strategy than FC for unpaired males, FC may be an important "last resort" strategy for older, experienced unpaired males late in the season. In general, my results provided strong support for the male fertilization strategy hypothesis. Behaviour Vol. 92 (1985) pp. 168-187 THE EFFECTS OF PREDATION RISK AND GROUP SIZE ON THE ANTI-PREDATOR RESPONSES OF NESTING LAPWINGS VANELLUS VANELLUS RICHARD D. ELLIOT University of Aberdeen, Culterty Field Station, Newburgh, Aberdeenshire, Scotland AB4 OAA The anti-predator responses of nesting lapwings were studied near Newburgh, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, using taxidermy mounts of a carrion crow, great black-backed gull, and red fox pulled towards their nests. Lapwings appeared to respond to these dummies and to a control woodpigeon as they would to the live animals. Responses to nest predators that are relatively harmless to adult lapwings, represented by the crow, included initial investigative flights. These quickly changed to diving attacks, over 60% of which actually struck the dummy predator. In response to the fox, which is a threat to both the adults and the eggs, lapwings never made physical contact, but circled overhead, or attempted to lead or distract the predator on the ground. Responses to the fox were similar in daylight and darkness, but lapwings did not respond to the dummy crow at night. Both diving and distraction responses to the gull were observed. Thus the closeness of attack was inversely related to the risk that the live predator would have posed to the adults. The intensity of response to the dummy crow increased through the incubation period and breeding season, as predicted on the basis of a decreasing difference between the reproductive value of the adults and the clutch they were protecting, resulting in the defenders under-taking increasingly greater risks. Both the number of lapwings responding to the crow, and the distances from the nest at which high intensity responses occurred, increased with the size of the nesting aggregation, ranging from one to five pairs, but not with the number of birds present prior to the experiment. Both these effects should lead to a higher probability of successfully repelling a crow with increasing group size. The area in which diving attacks occurred extended to 40-60 m from the nest in larger groups. Neither relationship was found in experiments with the dummy fox, in which all high intensity responses were performed by one adult only. Nesting in loose aggregations thus seems to enhance the effectiveness of the lapwings' responses to nest predators such as crows, but not to more dangerous predators such as the fox.

Time-budgets of female, male and yearling horses were calculated for 34 weeks over two years. There was little variation in the time spent in different activities during autumn and winter (Aug.-Mar.). 2. The horses spent more time lying (sleeping) in spring, when on a high protein diet. In summer they spent more time standing alert and walking, less feeding, probably because of the attacks by biting Diptera. 3. Within autumn and winter standing alert decreased when mosquitoes were abundant and standing resting, usually in shelter, increased on days with low maximum temperatures and during rain. Feeding time was unaffected by these variables. 4. The breeding mares increased their feeding times during periods of nutritional stress (end of winter, peak lactation) but only by 6-8%. 5. The time-budgets of these horses showed less variation than has been found in some ruminants. It is argued that for most of the year their feeding time is close to the maximum value allowed by the need to perform other activities, principally resting and moving.</page><page sequence="49">VOLUME 92 691 Behaviour Vol. 92 (1985) pp. 209-226 SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR IN A CONFINED BISON HERD VIKTOR REINHARDT Department of Veterinary Anatomy, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada S7N OWO Social behaviour was recorded in a 21-head bison herd kept in a 100 acre paddock. There were 13 females and 8 males ranging from 11/2 to 61/2 years of age. During 70 hrs of observation on 35 days between June and December 1983 a total of 5195 interactions were recorded. Disputes typically flared up when the animals were competing over supplemental food but dominance- subordination relationships were the same at feeding and idling. The bison avoided escalations of conflicts generally solving them by means of spontaneous withdrawing and threat demonstrations. Rank disputes were observed between the partners of all pairs of animals. During the first five months each pair showed an average of 16 rank indicating gestures who were consistently uni-directional. Bi-directional gestures occurred only in the two last months and were accompanied by three rank reversals. It was proposed that the pronounced rank respect was a major stabilizing element of the herd by making its members predictable to each other. Dominance depended on age and sex with older animals being dominant to young ones and males dominant to female age-mates. No evidence was found that mothers influence the dominance standing of their offspring. Unlike in cattle aggressiveness was an important means of dominance reinforcement. Animals were particularly aggressive against opponents close in rank. Aggressiveness was not a prerogative of either sex and females showed a number of aggressions against individual subordinates that was equivalent to that of males. The presence of an oestrous female did not markedly increase intermale aggression because subordinates generally kept away from any female that was already tended by a dominant opponent. Genital sniffing, chin raising and licking were prerogatives of males and focused on tended females. In the non-tending context chin raising (42 events recorded) was performed almost exclusively (41 times) by a dominant partner. The gesture was the exact opposite of the submissive withdrawal posture and it was inferred that, basically a courting behaviour, chin raising may also be ritualized acting as a dominance reinforcement. In 97% of (176) cases chin raising was an independent gesture, it was followed by mounting in only 3% of cases. Mounting and head-to-head pushing were also typical male activities but they were not focused on oestrous females. Dominant animals did not mount subordinates more often than the reverse. But head-to-head pushing was primarily initiated by dominant partners and it was suggested that the activity functioned as a friendly reinforcement of dominance. There were four pairs of animals-two non-kin related and two related ones-who were conspicuous in keeping each other's company and who were feeding-neighbours much more often than expected. It was concluded that the social structure of heterogeneous, confined bison herds is not only based on stable dominance-subordination relationships but also on interindividual bonds.

CSANYI Department of Behaviour Genetics, L. Eotvos University of Budapest, Jdvorka S. u. 14. God, H-2131 Hungary The predator recognition process of the paradise fish (Macropodus opercularis L.) was studied. It was found that both pike (predatory) and goldfish (harmless) elicit immediate attraction in laboratory raised predator-naive paradise fish. They approached and looked at the other fish on several occasions during a five minute trial. This approach reaction was even shown by paradise fish raised individually in complete isolation. If the approached pike was satiated it ignored the paradise fish and repeated exposures lead to lower approach tendency and more passive behaviour in the paradise fish as a result of habituation. The approach reaction to goldfish habituated faster and the habituation process thus depended on the characteristic of the stimulus species. If the paradise fish were attacked by the predator, their approach behaviour was significantly less during a subsequent encounter with a satiated pike. Diminishing approach was accompanied by a significant increase in escape behlaviour and the usual increase in passive behaviour did not occur.</page><page sequence="50">692 VOLUME 92 It was found also that the combination of a goldfish and a mild electric shock decreases approach to the companion and elicits avoidance of it by the paradise fish in a subsequent trial. The experiments are discussed in relation to predator recognition and learning processes. Behaviour Vol. 92 (1985) pp. 241-253 THE INTERACTION OF SIZE AND EXPERIENCE IN DOMINANCE RELATIONSHIPS OF JUVENILE STEELHEAD TROUT (SALMO GAIRDNERI) J.C. ABBOTT, R.L. DUNBRACK and C.D. ORR Dept. of Biological Sciences, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, B.C., Canada V5A lS6 Initial dominance relationships in pairs of juvenile steelhead trout are shown to depend upon relative size with a weight advantage of 5% being sufficient to assure dominant status for the larger fish. In pairs of initially equal sized trout, established dominance relationships could not be reversed by providing subordinates with more food than dominants. Of five subordinate fish in the first experimental group, three sustained substantial fin damage following the beginning of supplemental feeding and were discontinued. The remaining two did not become dominant despite becoming 62 and 114% larger than dominants. In a second experimental group none of the five experimental subordinates became dominant despite becoming 14 to 50% larger than dominants. We contend that the risk of injury and the low probability of increases in the relative body size or fighting ability of subordinates favour the use of experience by subordinates to settle contests. We also examine the implications of the use of experience for hierarchy stability. Behaviour Vol. 92 (1985) pp. 254-276 THE ONTOGENY OF SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR IN FOUR SPECIES OF CENTRARCHID FISH JOSEPH A. BROWN and PATRICK W. COLGAN Department of Biology, Queen's University at Kingston, Ontario, Canada The ontogeny of agonistic behaviour was studied in four species of centrarchid fish. Sixteen different ag- onistic MAPs were observed with eight being common to all four species. The two congeneric sunfish, bluegill and pumpkinseed, were most similar with regard to forms and frequencies of the MAPs. Large- mouth bass and rock bass were most different. The results did not support the observation that threat MAPs increase relative to aggressive MAPs as the fry aged. The onsets and types of agonistic MAPs dis- played by fry varied among species and appeared to be adaptive in that they were related to ecological events in the early life history of the fish in the lake.

They pair assortatively for size and males select larger females which carry more eggs. We have investigated the effect of loading on male Asellus aquaticus walking performance when carrying females in precopula. Males in precopula are slower than single males. Male performance declines as the ratio of male weight to female weight decreases. There is also an individual component to performance and speed as singles and in pairs is correlated. When individual males are tested with two different females their performance improves if the second female is lighter than the first, but it deteriorates if she is heavier. We conclude that loading effects contribute both to relatively large male size and to assortative mating in Asellus.</page><page sequence="51">VOLUME 92 693 Behaviour Vol. 92 (1985) pp. 288-301 A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE FANNING ACTIVITY IN THE MALE PADOGOBIUS MARTENSI (PISCES: GOBIIDAE) PATRIZIA TORRICELLI, MARCO LUGLI and GILBERTO GANDOLFI Institute of Zoology, University of Parma, Parma, Italy Nine cycles of parental care performed by six different males P. martensi were observed under laboratory conditions. For a quantitative analysis of the fanning activities the following main parameters were considered: time spent in the nest, time devoted to fanning, number of pectoral fin beats, number of bouts. All these parameters increase significantly from spawning to hatching time, independently of the duration of fanning. On the contrary, the beat frequency (i.e. number of beats per minute of fanning) decreases significantly as the parental cycle progresses. The amount of fanning performed during the parental cycle cannot be correlated to water temperature, probably because individual characteristics interact. However, one temperature effect emerges: the daily increase in the number of beats per bout and the average duration of a single bout are both positively correlated to the temperature. On the other hand, an induced fall in the amount of dissolved oxygen produces an increase of all parameters considered. Other activities linked with parental behaviour, i.e. cleaning of the eggs, are also discussed. Behaviour Vol. 92 (1985) pp. 302-321 TIME BUDGET IN GALAPAGOS FUR SEAL PUPS: THE INFLUENCE OF THE MOTHER'S PRESENCE AND ABSENCE ON PUP ACTIVITY AND PLAY WALTER ARNOLD and FRITZ TRILLMICH Max-Planck-Institut fur Verhaltensphysiologie, Abteilung Wickler, D-8131 Seewiesen, W.-Germany Time budgets of Galapagos fur seal pups were recorded. Two male pups were observed between the ages of I and 60 days, when their mothers were ashore. They became more active as they grew older and always showed more activity during the day than at night. Four male and 2 female pups, aged between 18 and 37 days, were observed in the absence of their mothers. The influence of age on activity level could be discounted during this period. Pups did not forage independently and therefore continuously lost weight while their mothers were at sea for a maximum of 4 continuous days; nevertheless, the pups' activity level remained constant. Pups were active for more time in the mother's presence than in her absence. But this was only due to long sucking times. Otherwise, less energetically demanding activities like sitting and lying predominated during the time active and playing and walking appeared to be reduced in the mother's presence. Male pups seemed to be more active than female pups, particularly in play-fighting. As they grew older, male pups lost more weight per unit time in the mothers' absence than female pups. The maintenance of a high level of activity and play in the mothers' absence, despite a lack of energy intake, can be explained by the behavioral ecology of fur seals. Benefits and costs as well as sex differences of play behavior are discussed.</page><page sequence="52">VOLUME 93 Behaviour Vol. 93 (1985) pp. 1-7 THE ROLES OF DAILY AND ANNUAL BIOLOGICAL RHYTHMS IN THE PHOTOPERIODIC REGULATION OF THE BREEDING SEASON IN THE STICKLERACK GASTEROSTEUS ACULEATUS L.

DE RUITER and S.E. WENDELAAR BONGA Department of Animal Physiology, University of Groningen, P.O. Box 14, 9750 AA Haren, The Netherlands Nestbuilding behaviour, which takes place in sexually mature males as a consequence of an enhanced level testosterone in the blood, considerably influences hydromineral balance. As shown by in vivo and in vitro experiments testosterone is directly involved in the glandular transformation of the nephronic tubule cells into gland cells, that secrete mucus for nestbuilding. Light and electron microscopical observations as well as physiological data provide strong evidence that, in sexually mature males both ion reabsorptive capacity of most of the nephronic tubule cells and glomerular filtration rate c.q. urine production has decreased considerably. As a consequence of this the water balance of these fish, living in freshwater, would be greatly disturbed. However in these males the intestine and apparently also the gall-bladder, compensate for the loss in renal function in maintaining hydromineral balance. Again, this is influenced by testosterone. Behaviour Vol. 93 (1985) pp. 21-35 REPRODUCTIVE BEHAVIOUR OF THE LANDLOCKED THREE-SPINED STICKLEBACK, GASTEROSTEUS ACULEATUS MICROCEPHALUS, IN JAPAN 1. THE YEAR-LONG PROLONGATION OF THE BREEDING PERIOD IN WATERBODIES WITH SPRINGS SEIICHI MORI Sakamoto Fish-farm, Mie Prefecture, Japan Seasonal changes in breeding activity of the landlocked three-spined stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus microcephalus, f. leiurus were studied in the field. The study area comprised several stations on the Yamayoke and Tsuya rivers (Gifu Prefecture, Japan), both on the main stream and in spring-fed areas along their banks. In these latter areas the temperature of the water remains constant (15°C) throughout the year, and breeding activity, exemplified mainly by the presence of nests continues all over the year, with a peak in the activity between March and May. In the main-stream areas the temperature of the water varies considerably and the three-spined sticklebacks show a seasonal breeding activity, similar to the situation reported for other countries. Prolongation of the breeding period is quite unusual for sticklebacks outside Japan. In this first publication on the year-long prolongation of the breeding activity it is claimed that it must be due to the favourable and constant temperature of the water in the spring-fed areas. Day- length seems to be unimportant in the control of the breeding activity of these sticklebacks. The role of the prolonged breeding period as a factor which promotes isolation between stickleback populations is discussed. 694</page><page sequence="53">VOLUME 93 Behaviour Vol. 93 (1985) pp. 36-55 PROLACTIN AND CORTISOL CONTROL OF SALINITY PREFERENCES IN GASTEROSTEUS ACULEATUS AND APELTES QUADRACUS CELINE AUDET, GERARD J. FITZGERALD and HELGA GUDERLEY D6partment de Biologie, Universit6 Laval, Qudbec, Canada G1K 7P4 Prolactin and cortisol effects on the salinity preferences of Gasterosteus aculeatus and Apeltes quadracus were examined in order to evaluate two possible mechanisms of endocrine transduction of the effects of photoperiod on salinity preferences: the temporal synergism hypothesis and the hypothesis of direct hormonal regulation. The tests of the temporal synergism hypothesis which were conducted with fish acclimated to continuous light showed that prolactin shifted salinity preferences of G. aculeatus and A. quadracus from salt to fresh water although solvent injections produced a similar effect in A. quadracus. Cortisol promoted a preference for salt water in A. quadracus. An interaction between these hormones was demonstrated for both species as simultaneous injection of cortisol and prolactin masked the specific effects of each hormone. In G. aculeatus a 12 h delay between injection of both hormones restored the response obtained with prolactin injected alone. As no condition restored salt water preferences, the time- lag between the plasma peaks of these 2 hormones cannot directly regulate seasonal changes in salinity preferences as shown for Fundulus grandis (FIVIZZANI &amp; MEIER, 1978). Fish acclimated to 9L:15D and 14L: IOD were used to test the hypothesis of direct hormonal regulation of salinity preferences. Prolactin and saline both promoted a fresher water preference in G. aculeatus, while prolactin clearly shifted the salinity preference of A. quadracus to fresh water. In A. quadracus acclimated to 14L:1OD, both cortisol and saline promoted a preference for more saline waters. Although solvent effects must be studied more intensively, on can conclude that seasonal differences in prolactin and cortisol levels (and possibly rhythms) are important in the regulation of salinity preferences in sticklebacks. Behaviour Vol. 93 (1985) p. 56 THE BEHAVIOUR OF GASTEROSTEUS ACULEATUS L. IN THE ZONE OF ACTION OF WARM WASTE WATERS I.N. RYABOV Institute of Evolutionary Animal Morphology and Ecology, USSR Academy of Sciences, Moscow, USSR The behaviour of Gasterosteus aculeatus L. was studied in the escape canal of an electric power station, which uses the water of a sea bay for cooling. In spring, warm waters attract G. aculatus into the escape canal, where males construct nests and spawning occurs. The male: female ratio in catches is usually 1:8. When the temperature in the canal was raised to 28-30°C, a part of the females died, the percentage of the males increased to 47%. Among the captured females, the majority had attained the IIIrd stage of maturity, since the females with more mature eggs had died. Of great interest is the fact that in the stomachs of most males eggs of their own species were present, at various developmental stages. Since G. aculeatus males construct a nest which is carefully protected against enemies, there is ground to believe that the rise in temperature to over 28°C in the escape canal resulted in disruption of parental behaviour. Incubation of the eggs taken from a G. aculeatus nest constructed in the canal, revealed that the eggs could develop without any visible anomalies at rather high temperatures (24-26°C), and even sustain a short-term increase of temperature to 37°C at the stage of the segmentation of the trunk mesoderm. That gives evidence that the increase of temperature of waste waters can be sustained by the eggs, but eventually it causes their death due to the disturbance of the male's parental behaviour. The male either eats the eggs laid in his own nest, or he gives up the nest, and the eggs are eaten by other fish as a result. 695</page><page sequence="54">696 VOLUME 93 Behaviour Vol. 93 (1985) pp. 57-68 VARIABILITY IN BREEDING BIOLOGY OF THREE-SPINED STICKLEBACKS (GASTEROSTEUS ACULEATUS): PROBLEMS WITH MEASURING POPULATION DIFFERENCES IN AGGRESSION N.

BAKKER Zoological Laboratory, Dept. of Ethology, University of Leiden, The Netherlands This paper summarizes some main results and conclusions of a behaviour genetic study on intraspecific aggressiveness in the three-spined stickleback (BAKKER, in press). Bidirectional selection experiments with aggressiveness in a number of test situations each serving as a criterion of selection, reveal that the phenotypic variation of aggressiveness in juvenile and adult females, in juvenile males, of territorial aggressiveness and dominance ability in reproductive males can to a considerable extent be described to genetic variation. Selection for enhanced aggressiveness generally is less effective than for reduced aggression levels. In females the genetic influence on aggressiveness in the juvenile and adult stage is most likely identical. However, in males different manifestations of aggressiveness (as measured in a number of test situations), though covered by the functional Aggression-concept, by no means represent a unity, neither with respect to their genetic causation nor with respect to their hormonal causation.

All test males (n = 43) ate some or all of their own 1251 labelled eggs. Eight males successfully reared some eggs to hatching. This success rate is comparable to those in the literature for other Gasterosteid species. Parental males and their nests were removed individually from a dugout. Differences in the importance of eggs in diet and the frequency of egg-consumption between trap-caught fish and parental males offered indirect evidence for the occurrence of filial cannibalism. Of 22 egg-guarding males which cannibalized eggs, 21 contained eggs at the same stage as eggs in their nest. In cases where the nearest neighbouring nest contained eggs of a different age, filial cannibalism (rather than egg-robbery) could be assumed in at least seven of 13 parental males which ate eggs.</page><page sequence="55">VOLUME 93 697 Behaviour Vol.93 (1985) pp. 101-111 EFFECTS OF FOOD AND DENSITY ON THE REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY OF THE THREESPINE STICKLEBACK WITH A HYPOTHESIS ON POPULATION LIMITATION IN STICKLEBACKS R.J.

The index of male reproductive success used was the number of eggs per nest and the per cent of males building nests. 3. Three was no significant relationship between reproductive success and density or abundance ratios. 4. The data of the present study (sympatric populations) were compared to a previous study (allopatric populations). A higher per cent of G. aculeatus bred in the sympatric than in the allopatric pools while the opposite was true for G. wheatlandi. There were no differences in the number of eggs per nest for either species between the allopatric and sympatric situations. 5. We conclude that interspecific interactions between G. aculeatus and G. wheatlandi may lower the reproductive success of G. wheatlandi when both species breed in sympatry.

KETELE and R.F. VERHEYEN University of Antwerp, Department of Biology (Zoology) Universiteitsplein 1, 2610 Wilrjk, Belgium 1. The three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus L. f. leiura, and the nine-spined stickleback, Pungitius pungitius (L.), which are very similar in morphology, diet and behaviour, prefer different nesting habitats in brooks and pools. When both species occur sympatrically in high densities, breeding also takes place in transitional zones intermediate between the two specific habitats. Competition between these two species was investigated in these transitional zones. 2. Laboratory experiments revealed that the reproductive success of G. aculeatus is not influenced by the presence or absence of P pungitius, but that the reproductive success of P. pungitius decreases when both species coexist. In this regard, coexistence of G. aculeatus and P. pungitius is a case of amensalism. When P. pungitius is able to mark out territories before G. aculeatus arrives, the status of P. pungitius is less subordinate but never equals the status of G. aculeatus.</page><page sequence="56">698 VOLUME 93 Behaviour Vol. 93 (1985) pp. 139-149 BEHAVIOURAL CONSEQUENCES OF CHEMORECEPTION DURING REPRODUCTIVE CYCLES OF THE THREE-SPINED STICKLEBACK (GASTEROSTEUS ACULEATUS L.)

ZIUGANOV Institute of Developmental Biology, U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences, Vavilov Street 26, Moscow 117 334, U.S.S.R. Two closely related allopatric species of the ninespine stickleback occur in Eurasia. One, Pungitius pungitius, is widespread within the arctic basin and the other, P platygaster, ranges in the southern regions (Pontearal-Caspian province). The ranges of both species were affected in recent years by human activities and three now appears to be a strong likelihood that their ranges will come to overlap in the</page><page sequence="57">VOLUME 93 699 near future. The differences in reproductive behavior among species of the Gasterosteidae plays a leading role in the formation of interspecific barriers (WOOTTON, 1976). In anticipation of the eventual contact of the two forms; I conducted experiments to investigate the question: Does the prolonged adaptation of these forms to different ecological conditions result in sterility of hybrids or not? Some preference tests were made between sexual partners in aquaria under laboratory conditions. The methods I used (following FOSTER, 1977) increased the likelihood of free choice of conspecific or "unfa- miliar" sexual partners. Females of both forms approximately equally chose to spawn with males of their own and the unfamiliar species. Some females of both species showed preference for males of P pungi- tius, which used more "striking" and demonstrative postures in the nuptial dance. The main differences in the spawning behavior of the two forms actually amount to differences in the elements of "twisting" and "leading", and to the faster completion of spawning in P. platygaster. It seems, that these differences are of only slight importance and, in case of sympatry of the two forms in the wild, probably would not prevent hybridization. Interspecific group crosses of P pungitius x P platygaster in controlled natural conditions (ponds) con- firmed my assumption that hybrid populations would be viable. F1 and F2 hybrids and backcrosses were fertile and viable, and hybrid-pond populations were self-reproductive and increased their numbers during the two years that I observed them. There is an interesting peculiarity in the spawning of hybrid males. Instead of building their nests on stems of plants, like males of either pure-species form, they build their nests under rocks on the substrate, like the males of Gasterosteus aculeatus. In summary, the results of my experiments have led me to conclude that, in case of contact between the two species in the wild (Irtyshriver, West Siberia), it is highly probable that substantial amounts of introgressive hybridization will occur.

UNDER COMPETITION FOR FOOD MANFRED MILINSKI Arbeitsgruppe fur Verhaltensforschung, Abteilung fur Biologie, Ruhr-Universitat, Postfach 102148, 4630 Bochum 1, F.R.G. Three spined sticklebacks which were either unparasitized, heavily infested by plerocercoids of the cestode Schistocephalus solidus, or parasitized by the sporozoan Glugea anomala were singly offered to choose between Tubifex worms at different distances from a live fish predator. The uninfested fisn preferred the</page><page sequence="58">700 VOLUME 93 worms most distant from the predator and fed at a lower rate than in its absence. Almost all sticklebacks infested by S. solidus, however, did not react to the predator; they fed at all distances equally often and at the same rate as with no predator present. Those infested by G. anomala fed at an intermediate rate between healthy fish and ones carrying S. solidus but stayed even farther away from the predator than uninfested fish. Both the increased need for food and the reduced fleeing ability of the parasitized sticklebacks do not seem to provide a sufficient functional explanation for the behavioural changes assuming that the infested fish balance differently the conflicting demands of predator avoidance and feeding. The fearless feeding of the fish infested by S. solidus which has to end up in a fish eating bird and the fearful behaviour of the sticklebacks parasitized by G. anomala for which the stickleback is the only host could both have been influenced by parasitic manipulation. During intraspecific competition for food between a stickleback infested either by S. solidus or G. anomala and an unparasitized one in the presence of the predator the healthy fish were clearly outcompeted by the parasitized ones. The overall competitive disadvantage of the parasitized fish can therefore be mitigated under the risk of predation. Behaviour Vol. 93 (1985) pp. 217-226 TERRITORIALITY AND REPRODUCTIVE TRADEOFFS IN THE THREESPINE STICKLEBACK, GASTEROSTEUS ACULEATUS ROBERT CRAIG SARGENT Department of Ecology and Evolution, State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY, U.S.A. To examine the reproductive costs of territoriality, male threespine sticklebacks were divided into two treatments: competitive and solitary. Relative to solitary males, competitive males had longer and fewer brood cycles, higher rates of energy expenditure per brood cycle, higher motivation to court additional females in the first brood cycle, and lower amounts of parental care during the first brood cycle. Thus territoriality in this species seems to effect the tradeoff between present versus future reproduction, and within present reproduction, the tradeoff between quantity versus quality offspring.

Both Long Island and Dutch territorial male Gasterosteus aculeatus exhibited considerable variation in their responses to dummies. Such responses were generally consistent within the same individual presented with the same dummy: male dummies evoked primarily aggressive behavior and female dummies evoked primarily courtship. However, males from both Long Island and Dutch populations sometimes directed courtship to male dummies and aggression to female dummies. 2. Males from both populations generally directed more aggression (bites) to the silver male dummy than to the dummy male bearing red undersides and blues eyes (i.e., nuptial coloration). However, exceptional males from both populations showed the opposite trend. In trials with Dutch males in which backoffs could be measured, this behavior was more often directed to the nuptially colored dummy male than to the silver one.</page><page sequence="59">VOLUME 93 701 3. Males from the Long Island population directed more activities, especially bites, to the horizontal dummy male than to either the headup or headdown dummy male. These males exhibited no difference in frequencies of behaviors directed to headup and head-down dummy males. Dutch males were only tested with headup vs horizontal dummy males and they too directed more activities, especially bites, to the latter. 4. Males from the Long Island population directed more courtship (zigzags and leads) and aggression (bites) to the dummy female with the greater abdominal distention, even when such distention was extreme (supernormal). Dutch males were only tested with (normally) gravid vs supergravid dummy females and they directed more activities, especially zigzags, to the latter. 5. Males from the Long Island population directed more courtship (zigzags and leads) and aggression (bites) to the horizontal dummy female than to either the headup or head-down one. Dutch males were only tested with headup vs horizontal dummy females and directed more courtship to the latter. Behaviour Vol. 93 (1985) pp. 258-277 DO THE DUMMY EXPERIMENTS WITH STICKLEBACKS SUPPORT THE IRM-CONCEPT? GERARD P. BAERENDS Zoological Laboratory, University of Groningen, The Netherlands Several investigators have found it difficult to produce in systematic series of tests satisfactory quantitative data in support of the initial findings of TER PELKWIJK &amp; TINBERGEN (1936, 1937) on the properties of IRMs supposed to be involved in evoking social responses in the three-spined stickleback. In particular with respect to the effectiveness of red in releasing aggressive responses, the results were often inconsistent; this paper gives a survey of the data obtained. On the basis of a comparison of these stickleback data with data obtained in a study of egg-recognition in gulls (BAERENDS &amp; DRENT, 1982), it is suggested that the inconsistencies are due to variation in the motivational state of the test fish, especially in the degree to which a tendency to escape is activated. It is argued that as a rule an experienced animal will in a particular situation not act on the basis of input from an IRM only, but in addition on relevant information encoded in the memory. It is conceived to be the principal function of the IRM to enable a naive animal to roughly identify at first encounter particular stimulus situations in its environment, which are essential to its survival. The animal would further extend its knowledge about these situations through learning. In the gulls, anxiety was found to reduce the influence of the IRM and increase the relative importance of memorized knowledge. If this conclusion may be generalized to the stickleback case, the failure of individual males in responding aggressively to red is likely to have been due to a dominant influence of memorized knowledge in anxious animals. This implies that to study the content of an IRM it has often to be 'unpacked' first, by reducing the escape factor as much as possible.</page><page sequence="60">702 VOLUME 94 Behaviour Vol. 94 (1985) pp. 1-40 PARENT-OFFSPRING CONFLICT IN BUDGERIGARS JUDY STAMPS, ANNE CLARK, PAT ARROWOOD and BARBARA KUS Department of Zoology, University of California, Davis, California 95616 U.S.A. Despite widespread theoretical interest in genetic conflict between parents and offspring, there is little empirical evidence that is exists in nature. Theoretical models suggest two outcomes of conflict not predicted by alternate theories: (1) offspring that control the allocation of parental investment might show escalated demand behaviours (e.g., begging) and demand more resources than they could efficiently use and (2) parents might evolve behavioural counterstrategies which prevented offspring from obtaining extra resources, but which were more costly than a "laissez-faire" parental strategy allowing offspring control. These predictions were tested in budgerigars, (Melopsittacus undulatus) in large flight cages at Davis, California. Budgerigar clutches hatch extremely asynchronously, yet all nestlings grew at similar rates and fledged at similar sizes and ages. This independence of natch order and performance seemed due primarily to the mother budgerigar's allofeeding strategy: females allofed offspring mainly on the basis of size, and only secondarily attended to begging rate. Offspring of a given age and size were treated the same by their mothers regardless of hatch order, and offspring undersized for their age were fed as if they were younger. In contrast, male budgerigars attended to offspring begging rates. Males tended to initiate feeding bouts when offspring begged, and to allofeed vigorous beggers more often. Variance in male allofeeding behaviour allowed comparisons of size-matched families in which females performed nearly all of the allofeeds to nestlings (_ female-fed families) with families in which males and females both allofed nestlings (= male-aided families). The parent controlled the allocation of food in female-fed families, while offspring had greater control over food allocation in male-fed families. As was predicted by conflict theory, the female counterstrategy was effective but potentially costly: the food delivery rate of females was only half as fast as males'. Conversely, offspring control resulted in an escalation of beg rate for the same degree of need (as measured by size and growth), and male-aided offspring obtained nearly three times more regurgitations than female-fed nestlings, yet grew at comparable rates and fledged at comparable sizes and ages. Hence, offspring demanded and obtained more food than they could effectively use. Other avian parents also seem to use effective but potentially costly counterstrategies, and other avian offspring may demand more food than they require. Even if initial hatch asynchronies functioned in brood reduction, the parental strategies described here would allow parents to retain control over the timing and conditions for offspring loss. Behaviour Vol.94 (1985) pp.41-59 FEEDING STRATEGIES OF MALE AND FEMALE ADULT HERRING GULLS (LARUS ARGENTATUS) S.A. GREIG, J.C. COULSON and P. MONAGHAN Zoology Department, University of Durham, and Zoology Department, University of Glasgow, U.K. This paper examines the foraging behaviour of adult male and female herring gulls at refuse tips during winter. Although the majority of herring gulls were either on the tip or nearby for much of the daylight period, an individual male or female fed at the tip for only 30 minutes per day. Three types of feeding were distinguished: (a) undisturbed primary feeding on freshly dumped refuse; (b) disturbed primary feeding where the gulls fed whilst a bulldozer was moving the refuse; and (c) sec- ondary feeding on dispersed refuse partially covered with earth. During primary feeding the herring gulls fed at high density and the feeding flock comprised 73% adults whilst during secondary feeding they were at low density and the flock contained only 25% adults. A comparison of disturbed and undisturbed pri- mary feeding showed that the birds dipped for food from the air in the former but searched for food on the ground in the latter. The resulted in eight times more encounters per individual and much greater competition in undisturbed feeding. Proportionally more adult male than female herring gulls participated in undisturbed (i.e. competitive) feeding, whereas the reverse was true of disturbed feeding. These differences were greatest in the first half of the winter (i.e. October-mid-December). There were no differences in the sex-ratio of those participating in secondary feeding. During undisturbed primary feeding adult females had higher pecking and walking rates and lower en- counter rates than males. Males obtained at least a fifth of their food by attacking and displacing other</page><page sequence="61">VOLUME 94 703 feeding herring gulls, three time more than females. Female herring gulls fed more often on the edge of the refuse pile where competitive interactions were less frequent but also where foraging success was lower. As the undisturbed feeding bout progressed, attack rates of males increased and their swallowing rate was sustained. In contrast, the attack rates of females decreased as did the swallowing rates. The pro- portion of females present also decreased, suggesting that some females were responding to the increased levels of aggression by leaving the feeding area. Refuse tips provide a variety of feeding opportunities. In a competitive feeding situation the smaller female herring gulls are disadvantaged by the dominance of males. In disturbed feeding they are able to compensate to some extent because their smaller size results in greater manoeuvrability.

Lambs were removed from their mothers at birth and tested under one of seven conditions: (1) with the dam in her pen, or, in a circular arena, (2) in the presence of a stationary model ewe, (3) with the same model, but moving, (4) in the presence of a large, headless and legless moving object, (5) with stimulation by the sound of recorded bleats, (6) with tactile stimulation or (7) with no stimulation. Indices of responsiveness included movements of righting and standing, approach to the model, bleating and nosing of the model or the arena. Results showed that lambs tested with the stationary model stood most slowly whereas the presence of the moving model ewe was associated with rapid standing. The groups with no experimental stimulation at all, or with stimulation by the sound of recorded bleats, also stood rapidly. Bleating of the lambs was most prevalent in the group with no stimulation at all. Lambs presented with moving models approached them more rapidly and nosed them more than did those tested with the stationary model. More than any others, lambs in the "stationary model" group were quiescent for long periods. Lambs tested in the presence of their mothers and those given tactile stimulation were consistently low in the rank order for all indices of response; in particular they stood more slowly and bleated less than groups presented with moving models. It is concluded that the dam is a composite stimulus for her lamb; she activates it when she moves but also elicits responses which reduced its early activity. 2. Aspects of the lamb which attract the ewe. Ninety Merino ewes, from each of which the lamb had been removed at birth, were tested in their own pens under one of the following conditions: (i) with their own lambs; (ii) with a warm, moving lamb model soaked in amniotic fluid and accompanied by lamb bleats, or with the same model but (iii) without movement; (iv) without warmth; (v) without bleats or (vi) without amniotic fluid. A seventh group was tested with a white bowl of warm amniotic fluid, also moving and accompanied by lamb bleats. The ewes approached their own lambs and were much more attentive to them, than to any of the models. The model which received the least attention was that (vi) with no amniotic fluid, while the 'model' which received the most was (vii) the white bowl containing amniotic fluid.

(2) Which are the dominance determining factors that are a result of group life ("group factors") and that cannot be found in pairs of animals? Melanochromis auratus, a cichlid fish from Lake Malawi, is studied under laboratory conditions as a representative model. Dominance relations in pairs of animals differ from those (between the same fishes) in groups of con- specifics.</page><page sequence="62">VOLUME 94 In groups M. auratus established and maintains a linear dominance hierarchy, of which the communicative structure is described and discussed. The number of aggressive interactions between two group members, is determined by the rank number of the actor and the reactor. Most interactions occur between rank neighbours. "Group factors" are looked for by analysing the clustering of all possible chase-interactions. Four cat- egories of such clusterings are discussed: a preceding aggressive interaction can have an influence on high-ranked animals, the effect of such an influence is directed towards low-ranked animals. The stable hierarchy can be changid by successive circle fights. The highest-ranked group members always intervene in circle fights in order to stabilize the hierarchy, for their own benefit. This is another "group factor". An alpha animal has to spend all its energy in obtaining and maintaining its rank status. When it looses this position, it drops down the hierarchy. The benefit of the alpha place could be the reproductive succes.

PAYNE Museum of Zoology and Division of Biological Sciences, The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, U.S.A. IAN ROWLEY CSIRO Division of Wildlife and Rangelands Research, Locked Bag No. 4, Midland, Western Australia 6056, Australia A population of cooperatively breeding, group-living splendid wrens was tested with a mounted parasitic cuckoo. At all nests with incubated eggs or nestlings, wrens attacked the cuckoo. The timing and intensity of attacks was independent of the nest day and of the age and breeding experience of the wrens. The breeding female usually spotted and attacked the cuckoo first. Her mate and the nonbreeding helpers responded to her call and mobbed and attacked the cuckoo. Response was no quicker in groups with nonbreeding auxiliaries than in single pairs. Discovery time was independent of the number of birds in a group and depended on the movements of the breeding female. Most wrens fed the young and mobbed the cuckoo. When a wren did not attack, it usually was caring for the young of another breeding female or an earlier brood. Variance in helping behavior was not closely associated with variance in the genetic relationship between helper and the breeding female or the young beneficiaries of mobbing. Use of a common territory, attendance at a nest, feeding the young, and mobbing and hitting a cuckoo were all associated cooperative activities. The main limitation of cooperative behavior in defense against the cuckoo is the same as the observed constraint on care of the young during the prolonged period of parental feeding-a conflict of interest among breeding females for care of their own young.

G1K 7P4 Parental investment and parent-offspring conflict theories make specific predictions on the behavior of parents and offspring. Since milk is a direct and vital form of maternal investment in mammals, nursing behavior is very well suited to test such predictions. We provide such tests here, as well as a fine-grained quantitative description of the weaning process in two species of deer. Both in white-tailed and fallow deer, fawns of primiparas had a significantly higher suckling rate than those of multiparous mothers in the first few days of life (2.90 ± 0.70 vs 1.24 ± 0.21 suckles/h from 0 to 5 days in FD, p &lt; 0.01; and 1.42 ± 0.22 vs 0.81 ± 0.08 suckles/h from 6 to 10 days in WTD, p &lt; 0.01). In both species, in the first 10 days of lactation, suckling bouts initiated by the mother had a significantly longer mean duration than those initiated by the fawn. We found no inter-sex difference in the rate of suckling, mean duration of suckles, total time suckling (s/h), and proportion of suckling attempts that were successful, in fawns of both species, at any age from birth to 80 days. White-tailed deer single fawns were identical to twins for all the above parameters. Fallow deer mothers were much more aggressive toward alien fawns than 704</page><page sequence="63">VOLUME 94 705 white-tailed deer mothers were, and spent more time close to their fawns (less than 10 m, 38% of the time from birth to 80 days, compared to 12% for white-tailed deer). We propose that weaning starts at about 20 days of age in both species. This is the time when the mother terminates more than half of all suckling bouts, terminates more bouts than she initiates, and when suckles are shorter when she initiates compared to when it is her fawn that does. Behaviour Vol.94 (1985) pp. 150-166 VERVET MONKEY ALARM CALLS: MANIPULATION THROUGH SHARED INFORMATION? DOROTHY L. CHENEY and ROBERT M. SEYFARTH Department of Anthropology, University of California, Los Angeles, Calif. 90024 U.S.A. and Institute of Primate Research, National Museums of Kenya, P.O. Box 34505, Nairobi, Kenya High-ranking male and female vervet monkeys in Amboseli National Park alarm-call at higher frequencies than do low-ranking males and females. This correlation between rank and alarm-calling does not occur because high-ranking animals have more offspring or close kin than low-ranking animals. Similarly, high-ranking animals do not seem to have greater opportunities to spot potential predators; they do not scan the habitat more than low-ranking animals, not are they more likely to be in the forefront of group progressions. It seems possible that low-ranking animals may spot predators as often as high-ranking animals, but that they do not always alert other group members to approaching danger. As a further test of the possibility that monkeys may vary the rate of alarm-calling depending on social contexts, an experiment was conducted on captive vervet monkeys in which adult females were presented with a predator in the presence of either their offspring or an unrelated juvenile. Adult females alarm-called significantly more often when with their offspring than with unrelated juveniles. A similar experiment conducted on adult males showed that males alarm-called at higher rates in the presence of adult females than in the presence of other adult males. The results of both experiments and observations suggest that monkeys may vary the rate at which they warn others of danger. The withholding of information may be an effective means to deceive others, because it is relatively difficult to detect cheaters. The possible advantages of selectivity in alarm call production are discussed.

Verhaltensphysiologie, D-8131 Seewiesen, F.R.G. 1. Stegodyphus mimosarum, a social spider, lives in colonies which may contain hundreds of individuals. Feeding behaviour was examined with respect to feeding group size and prey size. 2. Prey were less likely to escape and were subdued more quickly when attacked by more than one spider. 3. During capture small prey were frequently bitten directly on the body whereas large prey were almost always bitten on an appendage. 4. Pulling struggles for subdued prey occurred. They lasted longest over medium sized prey. Small prey were easier to transport to the nest than medium prey and large prey were pulled by more spiders from a single retreat. 5. Spiders which had participated in a capture initially bit preferentially on the prey's head or thorax but others which joined later to feed bit at random. 6. Feeding became less efficient as group size increased and an experiment suggests that individuals injected less poison and digestive enzymes when feeding in groups.</page><page sequence="64">706 VOLUME 94 Behaviour Vol. 94 (1985) pp. 183-201 ACOUSTIC COMMUNICATION AND MATING BEHAVIOUR IN THE MUELLERIANELLA COMPLEX (HOMOPTERA-DELPHACIDAE) S. DROSOPOULOS Laboratory of Entomology, Agricultural University, Wageningen, The Netherlands Some data on acoustic communication and mating behavior of two biparentally reproducing species and the clonally reproducing pseudogamous "species" of the genus Muellerianella are reported. Although bioacoustic differences were found in the calling songs between the species, these did not prevent pair- forming. Also, differences in mating behavior, such as pre-copulation behavior, courtship activities, frequency and duration of copulation were not sufficient to prevent successful hybridization between both the two biparentally reproducing species and between each of these two species and the pseudogamous "species". The data reported here are related to other biological differences reported previously. According to these data there is some evidence that differences in acoustic communication and mating behavior between the two species are established by ecological influences which in turn have established analogous physiological requirements. These differences are rather weak isolating mechanisms. Regarding the behavioral relation of the pseudogamous species with males of the two parental species it was found that these females behave exactly as the females of M. fairmairei with which they coexist in the field. In interspecific crosses mechanical barriers to copulation are more efficient than courtship differences. Finally it is assumed that pseudogamy is a strong isolation mechanism between the not yet fully genetically differentiated bisexual species of Muellerianella. Behaviour Vol. 94 (1985) pp. 203-211 FIELD OBSERVATIONS OF INTRASPECIFIC AND INTERSPECIFIC AGGRESSION AMONG STICKLEBACKS (GASTEROSTEIDAE) ALAIN GAUDREAULT and GERARD J. FITZGERALD Departement de biologie, Universite Laval, Ste-Foy, Qu6bec GIK 7P4, Canada The aggressive behavior and distribution of nests of three species of sticklebacks breeding sympartically in tide pools near Isle Verte, Quebec, were examined. The larger more aggressive G. aculeatus sometimes prevent the smaller G. wheatlandi from establishing territories or displace those that do establish territories. The third species P. pungitius, intermediate in size, nests largely in vegetation and thereby avoids intense interactions with the other two species. G. aculeatus and G. wheatlandi nest in open areas, the nests of the latter species being more clumped and closer to the pool banks than the former. In an experiment to test the aggressive response by resident territorial males to conspecific and heterospecific intruders, it was found that G. aculeatus was less tolerant towards conspecifics than towards Apeltes quadracus. This species does not occur in the tide pools at Isle Verte but is sympatric with G. aculeatus in a nearby tidal river. Aggression by G. wheatlandi towards G. aculeatus is higher than towards the other species. These differences in aggressive behaviour and spatial distribution are interpreted in the context of interspecific competition for nest sites, a limiting resource.

Eighteen different sounds are identified which could be related to one of the following functional cate- gories: contact, aggressive and defensive and attention and alarm behaviour. The call types within these behavioural categories show striking similarities in their acoustic structures. Vocalisations used during inter- and intragroup contact situations demonstrate harmonic spectra with low frequency fundamentals and formants and slight frequency modulations. Noisy spectra as well as an irregular repetition rate characterize sounds uttered by the aggressor during agonistic encounters. They can be intensified by visual threat displays. Harmonic spectra, high frequency fundamentals and formants,</page><page sequence="65">VOLUME 94 and rapid frequency modulations are typical for calls given by submissives during aggressive intraspecific interactions. Sounds which indicate social or external disturbance factors show noisy and harmonic spectra with broad dominant frequency range as well as a regular repetition rate. Factors that might have favoured the evolution of this call system are discussed. Behaviour Vol. 94 (1985) pp. 234-243 BEHAVIOURAL RESPONSES OF URBAN FERAL CATS TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF URINE MARKS EUGENIA NATOLI Dipartimento di Biologia Animale, Universita di Catania, Via Androne 81, 95124 Catania, Italy Ten adult feral cats, four males and six females, living in group in an urban environment, were tested measuring their reaction to six different types of urine placed, one by one, within the group territory. i) The six types of urine were: 1) sprayed urine of a strange male; 2) sprayed urine of a male from the group (sprayed urine = urine emitted raising the tail between 45° and 90°, and directing a fine spray of liquid from the anal/urogenital region on to a vertical object (CORBETT, 1979; DE BOER, 1977)); 3) 'excretory' urine of a strange male; 4) 'excretory' urine of a male from the group; 5) 'excretory' urine of a strange female; 6) 'excretory' urine of a female from the group ('excretory' urine = urine emitted from a squatting position, described by CORBETT (1979) and DE BOER (1977) as a behaviour that aims to empty the bladder). ii) The reaction of each animal was assessed by recording the amount of time (seconds) spent sniffing the six different samples of urine. iii) The amount of time spent sniffing the six different types of urine was analysed by means of analysis of variance and t-tests. iv) The response depended on the type of urine presented. Both males and females spent more time sniffing urine sprayed by a strange tomcat than either excretory urine from a strange tomcat or urine sprayed by a male from the group. v) The reaction of males was significantly more prolonged than those of females. vi) These results suggest that the function of inspecting urine marks may be to detect characteristics of the individual donor, especially its membership to the group.

VERRELL Department of Biology, The Open University, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, England 1. The influence of female availability on the sexual behaviour of male newts, Notophthalmus viridescens, was investigated. Only courtships of the amplexus type were observed to occur. 2. In the presence of four potential mates, the majority of males engaged in one or two courtships. Diving their time equally between both of their partners, males completing two courtships displayed at a higher rate than males completing one courtship with one female available. However, the former males remained in amplexus for the same total amount of time. 3. Males courting two females were just as likely to inseminate at least one of their partners as were males completing one courtship. Occasionally, males in the former group inseminated both of their partners. 4. Males apparently preferred novel females as mates, seldom courting previous partners. 5. These results provide further evidence of the complexity of male sexual behaviour in Notophthalmus viridescens. Data derived from field studies of this newt suggest that males may be exposed to aggregations of females in the natural environment. 707</page><page sequence="66">708 VOLUME 94 Behaviour Vol. 94 (1985) pp. 254-278 CONSEQUENCES OF DOMESTICATION ON THE SONG STRUCTURES IN THE CANARY HANS RUDOLF GUTTINGER Fachbereich Biologie der Universitat Kaiserslautern, Postfach 3049, D-6750 Kaiserslautern, B.R.D. This study on the organization and detailed acoustic morphology of birdsong deals with the implication of domestication upon behaviour. The songs of wild canaries (Serinus canaria) and different domesticated strains of canary were studied. These included border canaries, bred for appearance in Britain and song canaries, selected for song quality in Germany. The basic rules for developing song architecture, involving rules for assembling individually learned utterances into songs emerge by self-differentiation without any auditory or feedback stimuli. By contrast, the fine structure of notes is shaped by individual learning. A comparison of songs of wild canaries and of different domesticated breeds reveals how selective breeding can alter the behavioural programmes and the general acoustic morphology of learned notes. The results of this comparison can be summarized as follows. 1. All canaries sing phrases according to an identical programme. The temporal patterning of single utterances is very similar. 2. Quantitative differences are found in the proportion of single notes and trilled sequences or tours. Single note complexes are dominant in wild canary song, whereas in the domesticated breeds tours form the bulk of the songs. This quantitative difference is responsible for a highly contrasting impression to our ears of songs that are highly variable in the wild form, and very stereotyped in domesticated song canaries. Canary breeders select strongly for longer repetitions of identical utterances (duration of tours). Border canaries, which are not selected for this trait sing short tours, far more similar to the wild conspecifics than to the song canaries. 3. Low-pitched songs are highly esteemed by bird fanciers. The maximum frequency used by song canaries is much lower than that used by wild birds. 4. One can distinguished by ear approximately ten main syllable-categories, which recur in nearly every individual repertoire. This categorization is based on differences in their acoustic properties. To assess the subjective impression that individual learning is highly channeled in a few predictable overall categories, a reproducible method to define these universal categories has been developed: Individual repertoires depicted on sonagrams were analysed by using a dichotomous key of specific song characteristics and divided into 31 classes: The frequency of use of the syllable categories by individuals with totally different song repertoires was surprisingly similar: Some classes are highly overrepresented, whereas others are underrepresented. Thus wild and domesticated canaries form their individual repertoires according a similar array of charac- teristics. Thus species-specificity in the general acoustic morphology is based on rules for linking variable components of notes. Individuality is an attribute of single components, such as the pattern of frequency modulation and sequential patterning. One can demonstrate that the general acoustic morphology has re- mained astonishingly stable during the long process of domestication. The learning process seems to be restricted to a limited set of combinations of note components. Only a few characteristics of syllables ap- pear to have been changed by domestication: e.g. rough syllables have nearly been eliminated, whereas very short syllables (below 50 ms) have become far more frequent. Behaviour Vol. 94 (1985) pp. 279-323 ETHOMETRIE DES VOGELGESANGS: PROGRESSIVE UND REGRESSIVE AKTUALGENESE BEI DER GOLDAMMER (EMBERIZA CITRINELLA) HANS-WOLFGANG HELB Fachbereich Biologie der Universitait, Postfach 3049, D-6750 Kaiserslautern, B.R.D. 1. The vocalisations (song and calls) and the correlated behaviour of a free-living male yellowhammer (Emberiza citrinella) in Southern Germany have been analysed from tape recordings. In the continuous sequence of the male, which lasted a little less than 5 minutes, a spontaneous vocal microgenesis appeared after the female had flown away. 29 strophes or strophe fragments and 24 calls or groups of calls of the male have been evaluated by sonagrams, measurements of the sound pressure level (= SPL) as well as by a high-resolution signal analyser (linear, 20 Hz steps) with regard to the following parameters: sound structures respectively strophe type, strophe duration, interval duration between strophes, song sections,</page><page sequence="67">VOLUME 94 709 incomplete (broken off) strophes, sound frequency and relative SPL of 3 reference values (maximum intensity of the full strophe and the C-element; SPL of the maximum of the total song sequence 5.18 kHz). 2. Within the microgenetical song development we can distinguish between a longer, progressive and a shorter, regressive part (e.g. in the song sequence: 3 min/0.5 min). 3. The progressive and regressive microgenesis takes place on 3 different levels (see Fig. 21): a) during the whole vocalisation period by alternation of the sections calls-song-calls; b) within the song sequence by a continuous development of different parameters towards the culmination strophe 25 (_ absolute maximum intensity = 0 dB); c) within 3 song sections of equal length by the strophe duration, in the final call series by the interval duration. 4. In addition to 2 normal strophe types with the phrases Al and A2, supernormal strophes with terminal A3-phrases occur as well. 5. The strophe duration is determined by the variable A-phrases, partially also by the C-element (see Fig. 2). The longest strophes can be found in microgenetically exposed sequence positions. 6. The interval duration shows two peaks. Short intervals are at the beginning, long intervals with double the range of variation at the end of the strophe sequence. The significant change of duration takes place independently of the strophe type. However, correlations exist between strophe type, duration and the following interval. 7. The time spent on "singing" (m = 18%) correlates negatively with progression and regression. 8. 12 of the 29 strophes, mostly at the beginning, are incomplete. Strophes that were broken off and relatively short strophes also occur in microgenetically important positions. 9. Sound frequency (decreasing/increasing) and SPL of different reference values (increasing/decreasing) show microgenetical developments, some of which are highly significant. The highest SPL is located mainly at the end of the A-phrase, but also at the C-element, and frequently has nearly identical values in both the A-phrase and the C-element. 10. The C-elements, whose sound frequency is relatively stable, also perform the SPL microgenetically in the main band as well as in the side bands. 1. After the end of the song sequence, an added call sequence containing 4 call types some of which are similar to song elements undergoes a microgenesis on the interval level. 12. Frequency and situation of microgenetical cases are discussed. A comparison demonstrates that differences prevail over common features, which may be due to multiple factor control. 13. The fact that certain demands of vocal physiology and of biotope acoustics are satisfied makes it probable that incomplete strophes at the beginning of the microgenesis, with high sound frequency and low SPL, are especially effective at short range and consequently on the female. The following extended strophes, with increasing redundancy, decreased sound frequency and high SPL meet the requirements for long-range action and might therefore be mainly addressed to neighbouring conspecific males. Under these circumstances, the change of strophe types as well as the size and form of the strophe repertoire gains a new meaning. 14. The microgenesis presented here is at the same time a mirror of the decreasing singing inhibition. 15. Position and nature of the calls support the interface that in the transition from calls to song the microgenesis represents a recapitulation of the phylogenesis.

CLARKSON Department of Zoology, The University, Sheffield S1O 2TN, England During a seven year study of magpie social organisation we collected data to examine the idea that 'ceremonial gatherings' were associated with territory acquisition. Gatherings were initiated by high ranking, non-territorial birds, mainly in the three months prior to the breeding season. Most gatherings resulted in initiators being evicted, but in some cases they obtained a territory, either by displacing the owners, or by repeatedly visiting the same area and establishing a territory of their own, usually on territory boundaries where resistance from established birds was least. About 30% of territories were acquired via gatherings. The various ways in which other long-term territorial species acquire territories are discussed.</page><page sequence="68">710 VOLUME 95 Behaviour Vol. 95 (1985) pp. 1-10 COGNITIVE-BEHAVIOR AND STICKLEBACKS EVERETT J.

NEWBERRY and DAVID G.M. WOOD-GUSH The Edinburgh School of Agriculture, University of Edinburgh, West Mains Road, Edinburgh, EH9 3JG, Scotland The suckling behaviour of domestic pigs living in a socially and ecologically rich outdoor environment was examined in order to obtain a baseline for comparison with behaviour in more restricted and barren environments. In was found that the piglets' growth rates were not consistently influenced by their suckling location along the udder, and that the concept of dominance at the udder was not justified. Crowding at the udder was probably an important factor prompting piglets to seek milk solid food elsewhere, and two piglets switched from suckling from their own mother to suckling from another sow. True communal suckling was not exhibited. Piglets were responsible for locating their preferred teat and defending it from others. Sows did not attempt to prevent familiar piglets from other litters from suckling from them, although they sometimes terminated a suckling bout when disturbed by fights at the udder. Synchronization of suckling between litters was common. Suckling bouts did not always result in milk let-down, indicating that this is not a phenomenon exclusive to intensive housing systems. Weaning occurred naturally between 60 and 100 days after birth, and its timing varied both within and between litters but was not closely linked to the amount of aggression received from the sow. Behaviour Vol. 95 (1985) pp. 26-44 LONG-RANGE VOCAL INTERACTIONS BETWEEN GROUPS OF GIBBONS (HYLOBATES LAR) PATRICIA M. RAEMAEKERS and JEREMY J. RAEMAEKERS Biology Dept., Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand We report on long-range duet interactions among twelve wild groups of lar gibbons (Hylobates lar) in Thailand. Statistical analysis demonstrates that groups were more likely to respond with an answering duet to a duet sung by a neighbouring group than to one sung by a non-neighbouring group in the population. A distinctive pattern of response among neighbours was to wait until a neighbouring group had finished its duet before immediately answering with a duet, resulting in avoidance of overlap between the two duets. Non-neighbours did not exhibit this pattern. The effect is shown to be due solely to neighbour status and not to the degree of mutual audibility of the duets. There was no evidence that, when duets overlapped, the first group to sing modified the length of its duet in response to the second duet, whether given by a neighbour or by a non-neighbour. In general, among those groups which responded to one another's duets, there were no identifiable leaders and followers: the order of duetting groups was random. We discuss why neighbours interact more by duet than do non-neighbours, and consider what may be the functions of avoiding overlap of duets.

Helpers clearly prefer to stay in the family territory rather than leave for an</page><page sequence="69">VOLUME 95 711 aggregation of same-size young or for an unoccupied area-even when their chances of reproducing inde- pendently are superior to those in the field. Helpers usually attain independence when the breeders force them to leave the territory. Breeders' toleration of helpers depends on the stage in the reproductive cycle, the size of helpers and the need for helpers. Large, previously expelled helpers are reaccepted when com- petition is increased. In these circumstances breeders prefer their own former helpers to strange young. Experimental and field evidence suggests that 3 factors are ultimately important for the breeder/helper relationship: reproductive parasitism by mature helpers, eventual cannibalism on breeders' eggs and com- petition for shelter within the territory. A graphical model shows how the initially common interests of breeders and helpers develop divergently when helpers reach the size at which they become sexually ma- ture and less susceptible to predation. Large helpers pay to stay. The relationship of breeders and large helpers meets the criterion of reciprocal altruism. Behaviour Vol. 95 (1985) pp. 76-86 FEEDING BEHAVIOUR OF THREE SPECIES OF SQUIRRELS MOTOKAZU ANDO, SATOSHI SHIRAISHI and TERU AKI UCHIDA Zoological Laboratory, Faculty of Agriculture, Kyushu University 46-06, Fukuoka 812, Japan The Japanese giant flying squirrel, Petaurista leucogenys, Japanese flying squirrel, Pteromys momonga and Asiatic chipmunk, were compared for feeding behaviour under experimental conditions. Although P. leucogenys always fed in a sitting posture on branches, it extended its forepaws effectively both laterally and ventrally. When the animal was not able to place its large body on a slender twig, it brought the twig within reach of the mouth by the forepaws, obtaining food at the tip. P. momonga and T s. asiaticus took a hanging posture, too, and the former was more skillful in this posture than was the latter. In picking up food scattered on the floor, P leucogenys extended the body, without shifting its hindfeet, in a wide range including its lateral side; T s. asiaticus got food in a narrow range only just in front of the body, and P momonga had an intermediate range between those of the above two species. Among the three species, the daily frequency of feeding bouts was in inverse proportion to the duration of a feeding bout; P. leucogenys had relatively long and infrequent bours, the reverse being the case with T s. asiaticus. Characteristics of the posture, technique and frequency of feeding in the three species were supposed to be a reflection of interspecific differences in the diet, habitat, and freedom and length of the forelimb. Behaviour Vol. 95 (1985) pp. 87-109 COMPARATIVE ASPECTS OF BEHAVIOURAL DEVELOPMENT IN TWO SPECIES OF FREE-LIVING HYRAX T.M. CARO and R.M. ALAWI Serengeti Wildlife Research Institute, P.O. Seronera, via Arusha, Tanzania and Sub-Department of Animal Behaviour, University of Cambridge, Madingley, Cambridge, CB3 8AA, U.K. Four measures of play behaviour of two species of sympatrically living hyrax Heterohyrax brucei and Procavia johnstoni, were studied on three rocky outcrops or kopjes in the Serengeti National Park, Tan- zania. The amount of plays shown by young of both species, born in 1981, declined during the study. Procavia played at a significantly higher rate than did Heterohyrax throughout this period. This was true even after differences in species' activity were taken into account. Procavia did not show higher rates of behaviour because they had more conspecifics with which to interact. The young of both species of hyrax played with members of the other species; Procavia significantly more so than Heterohyrax. The high rates of interspecific play in Procavia could be explained by their relatively low numbers compared to Heterohyrax on one kopje, but on the other two kopjes they appeared to actively seek out interactions with Heterohyrax. Interspecific differences in the behaviour of young of the two hyrax species were then related to interspe- cific differences in their adult behaviour. Adult Procavia exhibited higher scores than adult Heterohyrax on three measures of behaviour, reflecting corresponding differences in the play of the young of these species. These differences were found even when adult behavioural scores had been standardised for ac- tivity. Furthermore, adult Procavia showed more interspecific behaviour than adult Heterohyrax; a result similar to that found in the play of the young of the two species of hyrax.</page><page sequence="70">712 VOLUME 95 Behaviour Vol.95 (1985) pp. 110-120 RESPONSES OF LAMBS TO MODEL EWES ELIZABETH SHILLITO WALSER, P.

Statistics Group, Department of Applied Biology, Pembroke Street, Cambridge CB2 3DX, England Life sized models of sheep were used to determine the importance of sound and movement in eliciting orientation and approach of lambs. Dalesbred and Jacob lambs were tested at 3 weeks of age with two models, one of which appeared to be grazing while the other moved its head or bleated or both bleated and moved. Lambs were tested twice; their behaviour was recorded to note 1) time of orientation to models and approach; 2) positive or negative response; 3) approach within 2 m of the models. The Dalesbred lambs ran faster than the Jacobs towards the models, and more Dalesbreds responded positively on the second test. Both breeds responded more quickly to the vocal models than to the silent models; there was no difference in time of response to moving and non-moving models. 90% lambs approached and looked at the models on the first test, 51% responded on the second test. All lambs that responded went up close to bleating models, but not to moving models. Movement did not increase attraction and seemed to deter close investigation, whereas vocalisation made the models most attractive to the lambs. Behaviour Vol. 95 (1985) pp. 121-137 OLFACTORY INTERACTIONS BETWEEN SEXUALLY ACTIVE MALES IN ADOXOPHYES ORANA (F.v.R.) (LEPIDOPTERA: TORTRICIDAE) S.C.A. BIJPOST, G. THOMAS and J.P. KRUIJT Department of Animal Physiology and Zoological Laboratory, University of Groningen, Postbus 14, 9750 AA Haren, The Netherlands Males of the summerfruit tortrix moth, Adoxophyes orana, placed in a windtunnel react to the odour of females with upwind walking, non-orientated wing fluttering and orientated fluttering. When groups of three males were arranged linearly in an air stream there was a decline in the last two sexual activities from upwind to downwind. As this was not found to be due to increasing distance from the pheromone source, it was concluded that upwind males inhibit the sexual behaviour of downwind males. The signal responsible for this inhibition proved to be an olfactory one. This inhibition was only seen when the upwind males were (1) sexually activated and (2) in a potentially competitive situation. Males perceiving male pheromone modify their behaviour by increasing the lateral component of their search path. This behaviour could increase the probability of finding another female in natural circumstances. Behaviour Vol.95 (1985) pp. 138-163 EXPLORATORY AGGRESSION IN CHIMPANZEES OTTO M.J. ADANG Laboratory of Comparative Physiology, University of Utrecht, and Burgers' Zoo, Amhem, The Netherlands Youngsters in the Amhem Zoo chimpanzee colony frequently "bother" adult group-members. They throw sticks and sand at them, hit them from behind, etc., and dash away immediately. This occurs without apparent instigation and in spite of the fact that they may be punished. Earlier data led to the hypothesis that this so-called quasi-aggressive behaviour (which also occurs in wild chimpanzees and in other species) is a form of social exploration caused by exploratory impulses which functions as a mechanism for youngsters to leam and expand social limits. To test this hypothesis new data were obtained on the same individuals. The results provide firm evidence that quasi-aggressive behaviour is indeed social exploration. Two different functional forms could be distinguished. 1. Uncertainty reduction. This form of social exploration is performed by male and female youngsters alike, especially towards adult females. The behaviour is more likely, the higher the level of response variability that the youngsters experience in their relationship with these females. This is indicated by the fact that there are strong positive correlations between response variability (as measured by the information-theoretical measure of uncertainty H) and frequency of quasi-aggressive behaviour performed.</page><page sequence="71">VOLUME 95 713 Female reactions tended to be highly variable and included many aggressive and fearful responses. The course and patterning of quasi-aggressive behaviour was strongly influenced not only by the variability in response types but also by the quality of the reaction. Quasi-aggressive behaviour continued more often after aggressive and fearful responses. Aggressive responses in particular resulted in longer bouts of quasi-aggressive behaviour, whereas fearful responses (which were stimulating initially) resulted in shorter bouts. After the behaviour had terminated it was repeated more quickly if the response of the target animal had been aggressive. Consistent ignoring reactions on the part of the target animals resulted in fewer and shorter bouts, which were repeated less quickly. It is argued that the results indicate that this type of quasi-aggressive behaviour is aimed at reducing uncertainty in the first place, whereas a secondary goal of the youngsters is to be able to "control" the (responses of) target animals. 2. Investigating authority. Quasi-aggressive behaviour performed towards adult males, especially by male youngsters, differs considerably from the "reducing uncertainty" type directed towards adult females. Instigating factors are: high adult male dominance rank and display of power by these high ranking males (viz. when they are 'bluffing'). The behaviour of the youngsters performing this type of quasi- aggressive behaviour is highly ambivalent: they show a clear intention to withdraw, their behaviour is often accompanied by 'submissive greeting', they show signs of fear relatively quickly, in spite of the fact that the males seldom react aggressively. The reaction of the males varies very little: on the whole (over 70% of the times) they ignored the youngsters. In the main, bouts against males lasted for a shorter time and were repeated less quickly (in spite of the fact that the males did not receive less quasi-aggressive behaviour than did the females). On the whole quasi-aggressive behaviour directed towards, males was less associated with the responses of the targets than that directed toward females. The "investigating authority" type of quasi-aggressive behaviour is related less to uncertainty and more to male dominance rank. It functions as a means for youngsters to learn about power relationships and about the constituents of "dominant behaviour". Both forms of social exploration test certain characteristics of the social environment of youngsters, viz. the nature of relationships of which the youngsters themselves form a part. It is argued that this effect is not achieved by any other behaviour. It is just as adaptive for youngsters to explore their social environment as it is for them to explore their physical environment: through exploration youngsters gain vital knowledge for a proper functioning in their surroundings. Behaviour Vol. 95 (1985) pp. 164-180 GEOGRAPHIC VARIATION IN THE SEXUAL BEHAVIOUR OF THE GUPPY, POECILIA RETICULATA (PETERS) P.H. LUYTEN and N.R. LILEY Department of Zoology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, B.C., Canada, V6T 2A9 The guppy, Poecilia reticulata, exhibits marked intraspecific variation in behaviour and morphology and occurs over a wide range of natural environments in Trinidad, West Indies. In this paper we examine the hypotheses that: 1) in clear mountain headstream waters in Trinidad, where Rivulus hartii is the only major aquatic predator, sexual selection has favoured the evolution of visual components of courtship behaviour in the guppy, and 2) in turbid lowland rivers with numerous aquatic predators selection has resulted in greater dependence upon non-visual components of courtship. Guppies were observed in four rivers in Trinidad. In two mountain headstreams guppies were evenly distributed across and along the river. Guppies in a lowland river and a 'modstream' river occurred in small schools close to the water's edge. Males guppies in the headstreams performed more frequent sigmoid displays and displays of longer duration than males in the turbid lowland river and the midstream river. Males in the turbid lowland river were found to exhibit higher frequencies of gonopodial thrusts than males in the other three rivers. Offspring of guppies from the four rivers were raised under identical conditions in the laboratory, free from predation and other selective agents. The results of observations of courtship behaviour in laboratory- raised fish are consistent with those obtained in the field. The overall similarity of results in the field and the laboratory provides evidence that there is a genetic basis to the observed behavioral differences between populations.</page><page sequence="72">714 VOLUME 95 Behaviour Vol.95 (1985) pp. 181-197 VARIATION IN THE MATING SYSTEM OF A BIPARENTAL CICHLID FISH, CICHLASOMA PANAMENSE T.J. TOWNSHEND and R.J. WOOTTON Department of Zoology, University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, Dyfed, Wales, U.K. Cichlasoma panamense is a biparental, substrate-spawning cichlid which breeds during the dry season in Panamanian streams. In one population some males helped to defend their offspring throughout the period of parental care but many deserted their mates to achieve additional spawnings leaving females to guard alone. The proportion of C. panamense guarding in pairs increased throughout the breeding season. This was associated withl an increase in the rate with which parental cichlids attacked potential brood predators and an increase in brood size. The increase in attack rate was due to the crowding of fishes as water levels receded during the dry season and especially to the increasing numbers of newly independent cichlids which congregated in the shallow water areas where C. panamense brood. The sex ratio in the population was strongly biased towards females. Males spent more time away from the brood than females which enabled them to find and spawn with unmated females. The attack rate of females brooding alone was not significantly higher than that of those with mates and their foraging rate not significantly lower although they spent less time away from their brood. In a more productive stream where population density was high, breeding was almost entirely in monogamous pairs. The rate at which parents attacked potential predators was higher, the sex ratio was 1:1 and brood size was large. The male's decision to guard or deser appears to depend on his opportunities for further matings, the ability of the female to guard alone and the value of a current brood. These results agree with the predictions of game theory models of parental care. Behaviour Vol. 95 (1985) pp. 198-202 PREDATION AND THE EVOLUTION OF PRECOPULA IN THE ISOPOD ASELLUS AQUATICUS PAUL A. VERRELL Department of Biology, The Open University, Walton Hall, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, England 1. The predatory behaviour of the smooth newt (Triturus vulgaris) on the isopod Asellus aquaticus was studied and the typical predatory sequence described. 2. Male Asellus in precopula experience a reduced risk of predation relative to single males. They seem to show an antipredator behaviour which 'confuses' the newt. 3. Precopula was probably influenced by both natural and sexual selection during the course of its evolution in this isopod.

BURNET Departments of Psychology and Genetics, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, England Descriptions of courtship behaviour are given for seven members of the melanogaster species sub-group: Drosophila melanogaster, simulans, mauritiana, yakuba, teissieri, erecta and orena. A male wing behaviour not previously reported, wing extension, was observed in either 1- or 2-wing variants in all species except melanogaster and simulans. Male wing rowing, previously reported in mauritiana and teissiri, was seen in 1- or 2-wing variants in all species except melanogaster and orena. D. teissiri showed the most extreme form of wing roving, and yakuba the widest variety of angles of wing vibration. Tapping by the male was observed in all species except simulans and mauritiana, but not always at the onset of courtship and not in every courtship. Extrusion in virgin females was observed in melanogaster and erecta, and abdomen extension in female simulans, yakuba, teissieri and orena. Female wing behaviours were observed in all species except simulans.</page><page sequence="73">VOLUME 95 715 Wing extension and wing rowing are distinct from vibration and scissoring (behaviours they strongly resemble). There is strong a behavioural connection between these pairs of behaviours, in that wing extension often leads to vibration, wing rowing to scissoring, and vice versa. A mechanical function for licking is proposed, following observations of long duration licking in yakuba. The function of licking is thought to be elevation of the female's abdomen, preparatory to copulation. The relationship between the seven species based on their courtship behaviours was examined using prin- cipal coordinates analysis. This suggests that the two cosmopolitan species, simulans and melanogaster, differ most widely in their courtship behaviour, with mauritiana being the most similar to simulans. This finding is assessed in relation to the ecology of the seven species, the role of courtship behaviour in speciation, and the reliability of inferences from behaviour in phylogenetic analyses. Behaviour Vol. 95 (1985) pp. 232-260 SEX ROLES IN THE AMERICAN OYSTERCATCHER ERICA NOL Department of Zoology, University of Toronto, Ont., Canada, M5S lAI American oystercatchers have extensive parental care. As a result sex roles are similar and highly com- plementary. During the pre-laying period the roles of males and females, except during copulation, are indistinguishable. During the laying period the roles diverge slightly with males spending more time chas- ing conspecifics. Presumably the similarity during pre-laying, and the differences during laying, function to prevent the male from being cuckolded. Males begin assisting in incubation as soon as the females be- gin incubating and then consistently perform the same proportion of incubation throughout this breeding stage. During incubation, females incubate more often than males, and consequently rest less, preen less and fly less than males. During chick-rearing males are involved in more chases than females and take more foraging trips to provision young but wait longer between successive trips. The pattern of foraging by each sex is complementary. Breeding season energy expenditure is approximately equal in both sexes. There is no evidence for conflict between the sexes over the contributions to parental care. Where sex roles diverge the differences in behaviour can be partly explained by the relative energetic efficiencies of each sex performing different tasks. Behaviour Vol. 95 (1985) pp. 261-289 THE INFLUENCE OF WEATHER ON INCUBATION SCHEDULING OF THE WHITE-RUMPED SANDPIPER (CALIDRIS FUSCICOLLIS): A UNIPARENTAL INCUBATOR IN A COLD ENVIRONMENT RALPH V. CANTAR and ROBERT D. MONTGOMERIE Department of Biology, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada K7L 3N6 We studied the incubation scheduling of 8 white-rumped sandpipers (Calidris fiuscicollis), a species in which only the female incubates. Because the female is small and nests in the high arctic, these birds are probably under more cold stress than birds nesting in the temperate zone. We examined the individual and collective effects of several weather variables on a female's incubation behaviour to ascertain what amount of the variability within a day was directly attributable to weather conditions. Birds made an average of 25.1 off-nest trips each day, averaging 10.5 min each. This resulted in spending, on average, 82.5% of their time incubating eggs. There was a clear within-day cycle in incubation scheduling; birds made more and longer trips in the middle of the day and, as a result, spent more total time off the nest in that period. Birds adjusted their hour-by-hour schedules to weather largely by altering the number of trips made, and less so by adjusting trip length. There was a circadian rhythm in recess time/h, explaining at least 11% of the variation in recess time/h. When the circadian rhythm was controlled statistically, weather accounted for an average of 38% of the explainable variation in recess time/h. The relative importance of each weather variable on the recess time/h was (in descending order of importance): wind speed, air temperature, solar radiation, barometric pressure, and relative humidity. Weather (primarily wind speed and temperature) exerted its strongest effects early and late in the bird's active day (0400-2300 h). On cold and windy days, birds increased the time spent on their nests early and late in the day, and made more trips than usual in the middle of the day, when air temperature was highest. We suggest that the incubation scheduling of these birds conformed to the long-term predictability of the daily weather cycle by following a circadian rhythm of behaviour modified by a response to concurrent weather that would have reduced egg cooling.</page><page sequence="74">716 VOLUME 95 Behaviour Vol. 95 (1985) pp. 290-313 INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO COOPERATIVE BEHAVIOUR IN THE ACORN WOODPECKER: EFFECTS OF REPRODUCTIVE STATUS, SEX, AND GROUP SIZE RONALD L. MUMME and ALAN DE QUEIROZ Hastings Reservation and Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, U.S.A. Acorn woodpeckers (Melanerpes formicivorus) are communal breeders that live in permanently territorial family groups of 2-15 individuals. All group members participate in several forms of cooperative behav- iour, which we define as the investment of resources in a common interest shared by other group members (CHASE, 1980). Acorn woodpecker group interests include the caching of acorns in a specialized storage tree (the granary), maintenance of the granary, and defence of the granary against intra- and interspecific intruders. Because of a strong positive relationship between the availability of stored acorns and group reproductive success, investments in acorn storage, granary maintenance, and granary defence have a direct positive effect on the individual fitness of breeders. Non-breeding helpers, however, do not realize a direct reproductive reward, and therefore profit less directly from investment in these forms of cooperative behaviour. Thus, we predicted that breeders should invest more heavily in cooperative behaviour than should helpers. The prediction was upheld: for nearly every form of cooperative behaviour examined, breeders contribute significantly more than do helpers. On the other hand, while established breeders only rarely intrude on neighbouring territories, nonreproductive helpers frequently do so. These dispersal "forays" constitute attempts by helpers to locate ecologically restricted breeding vacancies. The effect that group size has on individual contributions to cooperative behaviour is unclear. Individual rates of acorn storage decrease significantly with increasing group size, but granary attendance and granary maintenance do not. Male and female acorn woodpeckers do not differ in their contributions to acorn storage, granary mainte- nance, or interspecific defence. Females, however, play a significantly greater role in intraspecific defence because of a female-biased intruder sex ratio and sex-specific defensive behaviour. Behaviour Vol.95 (1985) pp.314-323 INTEGRITY OF A RED DEER STAG GROUP DURING THE VELVET PERIOD, ASSOCIATION OF INDIVIDUALS AND TIMING OF ANTLER CLEANING LUDEK BARTOS Department of Genetics, Research Institute of Animal Production, Praha - Uhffneves, Czechoslovakia VACLAV PERNER East Bohemia State Forest Enterprises, Ronov n/Doubrava, Czechoslovakia Previous studies on a "while" red deer herd at Zehusice, Czechoslovakia showed that a stag's antler casting and cleaning dates were related to his rank in the dominance hierarchy. The relationship was less apparent with antler cleaning than with casting. It was suggested that this is a consequence of disintegration of the bachelor group during the period of antler growth. A group of 14 individually recognised stags in a 1.26 km2 enclosure were observed 77 times between March 15th and August 22nd 1983. The number of stag groups, the distribution of stags into groups and the number of solitary stags was recorded on each occasion. For each observation the "relative dominance index" (RDI, rank position within a group divided by the number of stags in the group) was calculated for each individual. Correlation coefficients between antler cleaning dates and summed RDI values were calculated. As in previous seasons, and in contrast to the period preceding antler casting, the bachelor group disintegrated during the velvet period. As antler cleaning approached the stags tended to disperse into more groups and separate from other deer. The stags associated with others of similar rank and age. There was a close association between summed RDI values for individual stags for the last two weeks of the velvet period and dates of antler cleaning. Among pairs of stags which were closest associates during this period, the higher ranking stag always cleaned earlier. It is concluded that the disintegration of the bachelor group in the period before antler cleaning may be the major factor which causes a less apparent relationship between rank and the date of antler cleaning than between rank and date of antler casting. It is suggested that these two points in the antler cycle are regulated by hormones modulated by agonistic behaviour related to rank.</page><page sequence="75">VOLUME 96 717 Behaviour Vol.96 (1986) pp. 1-16 CROSS-FOSTERING, IMPRINTING AND LEARNING IN TWO SYMPATRIC SPECIES OF COCKATOO IAN ROWLEY and GRAEME CHAPMAN CSIRO Division of Wildlife and Rangelands Research, Helena Valley, Western Australia Two species of cockatoo, the galah Cacatua roseicapilla and Major Mitchell's cockatoo C. leadbeateri are sympatric throughout much of Australia. Both species nest in tree-hollows of similar dimensions at the same time of year. Their eggs which are very similar are laid every other day and are not incubated until at least three have been produced. Parent birds often forage a long way from the nest and so the early eggs are largely unattended. Sometimes a pair of C. roseicapilla and one of C. leadbeateri both "own" the same hollow and contribute eggs to the clutch. When confrontation finally arises the C. roseicapilla being smaller, lose out and the C. leadbeateri unknowingly incubate a mixed parentage clutch, and may rear a young C. roseicapilla with their own offspring. Such cross-fostered C. roseicapilla behave as, and associate with C. leadbeateri; they ignore other C. roseicapilla. Parts of their behaviour repertoire are innate, parts are the result of imprinting and parts, of later learning. They learn to fly and to call like C. leadbeateri and they also adopt the latter's much more varied diet. Cross-fostered C. roseicapilla are probably responsible for those cases of hybridisation in the wild between C. roseicapilla and C. leadbeateri that have been reported. Behaviour Vol. 96 (1986) pp. 17-27 MATE CHANGE ENHANCES DUETTING ACTIVITY IN THE SIAMANG GIBBON (HYLOBATES SYNDACTULUS) THOMAS GEISSMANN Anthropological Institute, University Ziirich-Irchel, Winterthurerstrasse 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland Siamang gibbons produce long and complex duet songs. The hypothesis that duetting may act as adver- tisement of the presence and the status of a mated pair has repeatedly been suggested for duetting birds. If a pair bonding effect of the duet is actually attained through a partner-directed learning effort resulting in a pair-specific duet, the learning investment should be concentrated into a time period as short as pos- sible in order to avoid competitors. Therefore, after the formation of a new pair, an increase of singing activity should be expected. In order to test this prediction, the singing activity of a pair of captive sia- mang before and after a partner exchange was compared. In the newly formed pair, an increase in singing activity was observed. Additional observations on a second new pair show a similar trend. In this case, both new mates remained in their familiar place so that their singing activity was unlikely to be affected by the process of establishing a new territory. Behaviour Vol. 96 (1986) pp. 28-48 STRUCTURE AND CAUSATION OF THE DOMINANCE HIERARCHY IN A FLOCK OF BAR-HEADED GEESE (ANSER INDICUS) JURG LAMPRECHT Max-Planck-Institut fur Verhaltensphysiologie, D-8131 Seewiesen, F.R.G. In a flock of tame, free-flying bar-headed geese (Anser indicus) the structure, stability and causes of the dominance hierarchy among different types of social units were studied. 1. In accordance with field results of other authors, families proved dominant over pairs, pairs over unpaired birds, and single males dominated single females. Single females with young ranked between families and pairs in this study, and lone breeding males whose females were incubating ranked between pairs and unpaired individuals. Contrary to some field studies, no rank differences were found between different-sized families. 2. The dominance value of pairs in winter correlated with subsequent fledging success, and there was some causal evidence that high-ranking males are more likely to obtain a mate. This would result in relating high rank to families, medium rank to pairs and low rank to unpaired birds. Yet as temporarily leaving the mate was promptly followed by a drop in rank and successful breeding by a rise in rank, the social context seems a major cause, and only to a minor extent a consequence of dominance rank.</page><page sequence="76">718 VOLUME 96 3. Age correlated more strongly with a pair's rank in winter than weight, tarsus length and upper beak length. Rank in summer correlated highly with rank in the following winter. A positive feedback system 'age- dominance--&gt;fledging success--higher dominance- fledging success' is suggested which could account for the 'delayed breeding' common in geese and swans. 4. In pairs or families male age correlated more strongly than female age with winter dominance. Most opponents were displayed by the male alone, and only the male of a pair got involved in highest intensity aggression (wing-beat fighting). The widowed female of one high-ranking pair was low-ranking in sub- sequent years when paired with a young low-ranking male. The evidence suggests that the gander alone determines a family's or pair's rank. 5. There was no indication of a positive co-operative effect achieved by joint aggression. Comparison of frequencies of aggressive acts and postures between birds in different social contexts suggested that the presence of the male and/or offspring increases fighting motivation, thus explaining the dependence of rank on the social context. 6. The stability of dyadic dominance relationships between social units was greater between than within social classes. The hierarchy of social classes can be explained by geese signalling their degree of fighting motivation to each other. Individual recognition of members of other social units seems of minor importance for the hierarchy even in this stable flock.

These vocalizations have traditionally been considered to be a manifestation of a particular level of arousal in animals. Playback experiments suggest, however, that each group member is able to distinguish trills to which he originally responded from others, and that anticipation of responding animals is possible by voice alone in every on a truly individual basis. Results indicate that trills given by spider monkeys may function in a rudimentary representation manner to designate fellow group members. Behaviour Vol. 96 (1986) pp. 62-91 DOMINANCE AND ITS FITNESS CONSEQUENCES IN AMERICAN BISON COWS ALLEN T. RUTBERG Department of Zoology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195, U.S.A. 1. Dominance relations among adult female American bison (Bison bison) were studied between June 1980 and August 1982 at the National Bison Range, Moiese, Montana, and Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, U.S.A. 2. Contested interactions, or "battles", between cows were rare at both sites. Only one of 362 observed interactions among known Bison Range cows was contested, and only four such interactions were observed during the entire study. 3. Among Bison Range cows, reversals of dominance status within dyads occurred at an extrapolated rate of once every 7.5 dyad-years. 4. Success in aggressive encounters between Bison Range cows was strongly, positively correlated with age, but uncorrelated with body weight or horn damage. Hence, dominance appears to be poorly correlated with fighting ability. Instead, dominance may be determined by cost-benefit asymmetries; older cows may have less to lose from aggression than younger cows. 5. The cow dominance "hierarchy" at the Bison Range does not show a higher degree of linearity than expected given the age-dominance correlation. 6. At neither Yellowstone nor the Bison Range was there evidence of aggressive inhibition of female reproduction, or of harassment of calves by dominant cows. 7. In a variety of environments, a cow that received aggression during foraging suffered a reduction in the proportion of foraging time she spent cropping. Since aggression frequencies varied considerably between habitats, however, the influence of dominance on cropping times also varied between habitats. 8. Aggression frequencies were highest in habitats where forage was sparse and heterogeneous in quality. Accordingly, aggression was most frequent, and probably had the strongest effects on feeding efficiency, in habitats where there was significant travel time between suitable grazing patches.</page><page sequence="77">VOLUME 96 719 Behaviour Vol.96 (1986) pp.92-104 REACTION TO NOVEL OBJECTS IN A TROOP OF GUINEA BABOONS: APPROACH AND MANIPULATION A. JOUBERT and J. VAUCLAIR Ddpartement de Psychologie Animale, C.N.R.S.-I.N.P.9, 31, chemin J. Aiguier, 13402 Marseille cedex 9, France A troop of Guinea baboons living in an enclosure was exposed every day and for twelve consecutive days to a new object. The new object and the object(s) of the previous day(s) were presented simultaneously in the compound. The troop as a whole demonstrated excellent abilities to rapidly react to the new objects: 11 out of 12 new objects were discovered within a maximum of 3 min of their first presentation and were furthermore the first to be approached. An analysis conducted on data from age and sex subgroups showed the preponderant part played by juveniles and by some adult males in the discovery process and subsequent contacts with objects. The results are discussed within the conceptual frame of "cognitive mapping". In addition, the extent to which social factors (e.g. dominance) and perceptual and cognitive factors might determine the differential role of subgroups in the exploration and manipulation of objects is examined. Behaviour Vol.96 (1986) pp. 105-129 TEMPORAL PATTERNS OF FEEDING BEHAVIOUR IN FREE-RANGING HORSES ELEANOR MAYES and PATRICK DUNCAN Station Biologique de la Tour du Valat, Le Sambuc, F-13200 Arles, France Feeding was patterned into meals separated by intervals of non-random length. Meal length, which showed a marked circadian rhythm, was positively correlated with the length of the preceding interval (preprandial correlation) in all seasons except the summer. This result implies the existence of a control mechanism which maintained gut-fill high. The organisation of feeding within males (length of feeding, standing and walking bouts) did not vary consistently between vegetation types, but was strongly influenced by the activity of biting flies. Behaviour Vol. 96 (1986) pp. 130-163 ACOUSTIC RECOGNITION BETWEEN MOTHER AND CUBS IN RACCOONS (PROCYON LOTOR) OTTO J. SIEBER Department of Zoological Research, U.S. National Zoological Park, Smithsonian Institution, Washington D.C. 20008, U.S.A., and Universtitait Bern, Ethologische Station Hasli, Wohlenstrasse 50a, CH-3032 Hinterkappelen, Switzerland Two vocalizations, utilized by raccoon (Procyon lotor) mothers ("chitter") and their dependent cubs ("whistle") to establish and maintain contact among each other, are studied in captive groups containing a total of 6 mothers and their 23 cubs. The paper describes frequency of occurrence of the calls, contexts of the callers, individual variation in the call's structure and the responses of the callees both in uncontrolled situations and in playback experiments. Maternal chitters are most frequently used during the month following the first excursion of the cubs from the litter den by females approaching the cubs or leading them to the food. The frequency of whistling in cubs is high during the nestling period and decrease when they become mobile. The main context of whistling in the cub-mother relationship is answering maternal chitters. Mobile cubs follow their chittering mother silently. The chitters of 4 females differ individually, the main distinctive feature being frequency and pulse rate. The whistles of 12 cubs are individually distinctive, too; duration and frequency measures differ most between individuals. Hence, mothers and cubs have the potential for individual acoustic identification. Seven-week-old nestlings, tested in an experimental arena with successive playbacks, answered maternal chitters on average more often and faster than alien ones, warning grunts or a noise. Mobile cubs approached maternal chitters more often when tested in simultaneous playback experiments. Only 2 of 6 females, however, confronted with whistle-playbacks of their own vs alien cubs in their cages, responded</page><page sequence="78">720 VOLUME 96 more strongly to calls of their offspring. Results indicate that raccoons may be capable of recognizing family members by acoustic cues alone on a familiar vs strange basis. Advantages of using vocalizations in mother-young relationship and of the potential for acoustic identifi- cation and recognition in a solitary mammal are discussed.

VINCE A.F.R.C., Institute of Animal Physiology, Babraham, Cambridge, CB2 4AT England Forty Clun Forest lambs were removed from their dams immediately after lambing and were tested singly for 30 minutes in a circular arena under one of four conditions: (1) with no stimulation, (2) in the presence of recorded low frequency, low amplitude "rumble"-type vocalisations of the kind made by the ewe from just before lambing and in caring for her lamb, (3) in the presence of a large, rectangular, white, moving object, or (4) in the presence of the same white object and of the recorded "rumbles". The results showed that righting movements were reduced and standing delayed in the lambs which heard "rumbles", whether or not they were in the presence of the moving object. For two other indices of response there was no effect of rumbles but behaviour varied with the presence or absence of the moving object: there were fewer ear movements in lambs presented with the model, as compared with those without and there was more tail-wagging in the presence of the model, than without it. Results are discussed in terms of the dam as a composite stimulus for her lamb.

GLENNA STEWART Raptor Research Group, Box 210, MacDonald Campus, McGill University, Ste Anne de Bellevue, P.Q. Canada H9X lCO We tested some costs and benefits associated with variable levels of mobbing response towards nest predators by American robins. Playbacks of robin mobbing calls attracted a major predator of robin nests, the northwestern crow. This demonstrates a potential cost to robins that give mobbing calls. We then used human 'predators' to test whether reproductive success was related to mobbing intensity. We first showed that mobbing responses to humans resembled those shown to a stuffed crow. Second, we demonstrated that responses of pairs of robins were consistent at different tests at the same nest, but were less consistent between different nesting attempts of the same pair. The first result validates our experimental procedure, but the second result suggests that variation in mobbing response is partly determined by characteristics of the nest or nest site, rather than by the level if aggressiveness of the parents. When we compared mobbing responses by robins at exposed and well-concealed nests, robins with exposed nests used extreme responses (swoops and hits) more frequently than those with concealed nests. We did not, however, find an consistent relationship between mobbing intensity, stage of the nestling cycle, or reproductive success. Robins did not respond more strongly late in the nesting cycle, and pairs that responded weakly, or strongly, experienced similar levels of nesting success.</page><page sequence="79">VOLUME 96 721 Behaviour Vol. 96 (1986) pp. 187-209 RANGE USE PATTERNS AND SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS OF MERRIAM'S KANGAROO RATS (DIPODOMYS MERRIAMI) PHILIP BEHRENDS, MATRIN DALY and MARGO I. WILSON Department of Psychology, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, L8S 4K1, Canada Radiotelementry was used to investigate the home range patterns and inter-individual spatial relationships of Merriam's kangaroo rat (Dipodomys merriami). Sixty adult D. merriami (32 males and 28 females) were radio-tracked for varying lengths of time over three study periods between November 1980 and December 1982, on two desert habitat sites located near Palm Desert, California. Analyses of home range size and utilization patterns, range overlap with conspecifics, and day burrow distribution and use patterns were carried out. Home range varied between 0.03 ha and 1.16 ha with substantial inter-study differences but no apparent sex differences. Animals maintained relatively stable core activity loci within their ranges which were centered around frequently occupied day burrows. However, long sallies of 100 m or more away from core areas were not uncommon. The examination of shifts in animals' centers-of-activity (COA) over long periods of time indicated that animals maintained relatively stable home ranges over seasons and even years although a few individuals did exhibit COA shifts of more than 100 m. There was substantial home range overlap, with individuals overlapping the ranges of up to 14 radio-implanted conspecifics. The home ranges of pairs of neighboring females overlapped less than did those of males or pairs of opposite sex, and the average nearest-neighbor distance between the day burrows of males and females was significantly smaller than the average nearest-neighbor distance between females. Thus in kangaroo rats, as in other "solitary" rodents, females maintain territorial spacing to a greater degree than do males. D. merriami utilized several day burrows with moves occurring once every four days on average. However, most animals used only one or two day burrows frequently. The largest moves coincided with reproduc- tive activity, and in particular with the day of estrus. The findings are discussed with respect to their implications for D. merriami social structure, and for comparative studies within the genus Dipodomys and within the order Rodentia. Behaviour Vol. 96 (1986) pp. 210-226 ABOVEGROUND ACTIVITY OF MERRIAM'S KANGAROO RATS (DIPODOMYS MERRIAMI) IN RELATION TO SEX AND REPRODUCTION PHILIP BEHRENDS, MARTIN DALY and MARGO I. WILSON Department of Psychology, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, L8S 4K1, Canada Sixty-seven male and female Merriam's kangaroo rats (Dipodomys merriami) were radio-tracked over four study periods between November 1980 and mid-March 1984 on two study sites near Palm Desert, Riverside Country, California. Animals were located once per hour yielding data representing 10,996 animal hours and 1232 animal days. The reproductive condition of animals during the tracking periods was also monitored. This paper describes the general surface activity patterns of D. merriami in terms of the mean distance moved in meters between successive hourly fixes (called MHD) with particular emphasis on movements in relation to sex and reproductive condition. It was found that during non-breeding periods (study periods 1 and 3), males and females exhibited similar surface movement patterns, although during period 1, between-male variance was significantly greater than between-female variance. During the breeding season (study period 2), however, males moved significantly more from one hour to the next than did females, and again between-male variance was significantly greater than between-female variance. Movements were also found to be related to reproductive condition in both females and males. During study period 2, females that were estrous, pregnant, or lactating moved significantly more than when they were non-reproductive. One female in study period 2 and two females in study period 4 moved their day burrows over exceptional distances precisely at the time of estrus. In study period 3, there was a significant positive correlation between testis length in males and surface movements. These results indicate that surface activity by D. merriami reflects different behavioral strategies by individuals in relation to sex and reproduction; and that analyses which attempt to balance the costs of surface activity must consider the social functions of such activity and not simply the foraging returns.</page><page sequence="80">722 VOLUME 96 Behaviour Vol. 96 (1986) pp. 227-240 DISRUPTION OF SEXUAL BEHAVIOUR BY HIGH RANKING RHESUS MONKEYS (MACACA MULATTA) MARIA-CARMEN RUIZ DE ELVIRA and JAMES G. HERNDON Division of Neurobiology, Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center, and Department of Biology, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322, U.S.A. We studied the association between social rank and sexual behaviour in a group of rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) (10 males, 14 females) housed in two adjacent 15.25 x 15.25 m compounds which were separated by a solid metal wall. This wall had a small opening through which the monkeys could move from one compound to another. Because of the position of this opening, most monkeys in one compound were hidden from view of the monkeys that remained in the other compound. It was therefore possible for an observer to record whether sexual behaviour was initiated within or outside the field of view of the four highest ranking animals (two males and two females). About 2/3 of the mount sequences initiated by lower ranking males were begun when the dominant animals were out of view. Such behaviour was usually disrupted if dominant animals entered the compound in which it was taking place. Most disruptions of sexual behaviour were accomplished by means of aggression directed by a dominant animal toward one or both members of the consorting pair. In most such cases, the aggression was directed by a dominant male toward the female member of the consorting pair. This study demonstrates that dominant animals tend to interfere with the sexual behaviour of subordinate animals, and that lower ranking animals are likely to begin copulatory activity out of view of higher ranking males and females. These tendencies may account for previous findings of a strong relationship between frequency of copulatory activity and social rank in group-dwelling rhesus monkeys. Behaviour Vol. 96 (1986) pp. 241-264 CAUSATION AND FUNCTION OF DIFFERENT VOCAL REACTIONS OF LITTLE GULLS LARUS MINUTUS TO INTRUDES NEAR THE NEST JAN VEEN and THEUNIS PIERSMA Zoological Laboratory, University of Groningen, P.O. Box 14, 9750 AA Haren (Gr.), The Netherlands This study deals with (1) which vocalizations are made by little gulls (Larus minutus) during agonistic interactions and (2) how these are related with overt attack and escape behaviour. Under natural circumstances, when little gulls react to intruders approaching the nests, five different call types can be heard. Four of these, Tuk, Kee, Eeyit and Whet, often occurred during experiments using stuffed intruder models (little gull and black-headed gull). Reactions of incubating little gulls to a stuffed conspecific placed near the nests, showed that the occurrence of different call types is related to different phases of the flight pattern, such as circling above the intruder, approaching, attacking and moving away. Reactions to a stuffed little gull and black-headed gull which were moved towards and away from the nests revealed that the call types Whet, Eeyit, Kee and Tuk, were, in decreasing order, association with actual attack. Consistent individual differences existed in the reactions to the experimental intruders. The movements and the vocalizations made by the gulls when reacting to the experimental intruders are explained as a consequence of a conflict between motivational systems for attack and escape. It is argued that different call types are related with different strengths of activation of these systems. Differences between individuals in the reactions to the intruders can largely be explained by individual- typical differences in motivation. A comparison of the physical structure of each type of vocalization in relation to its underlying motivational state, shows a positive relationship between call duration and attack motivation. Tuk is believed to function as a warning for neighbouring birds, chicks and the mate. Eeyit seems to convey 'I shall attack, if provoked' and is intended for the intruder. Whet probably acts as a vocal part of the actual attack and may help in impressing and distracting the intruder. The functional significance of Kee is as yet unknown.</page><page sequence="81">VOLUME 96 723 Behaviour Vol. 96 (1986) pp. 265-276 RADIO-TRACKING OF PIGEONS PREVIOUSLY EXPOSED TO RANDOM OSCILLATING MAGNETIC FIELDS ANNE TEYSSEDRE Instituto di Biologia generale dell'Universita, Via A. Volta 6, 56100 Pisa, Italia Pigeons exposed to a random oscillating magnetic field prior to release from Bolgheri, 50 km SSE from their loft (near Pisa) were observed to behave in a consistent manner. Generally, the birds initially flew westwards, and all approached the sea with or without detours. Two interesting cases were pigeons 5 and 18 (see Fig. 1) which optically vanished east from the release site but none less arrived at the coast. Subsequently, the pigeons were found to shift their orientation to the NNW, the homeward direction. Flight period were regularly interrupted by pauses, but pigeons were not observed to correct their initial aberrant orientation after pauses. An actual flight of 5 to 10 minutes was necessary before they shifted their orientation homeward. Shift occurred was found to be more related to distance reached from the release site than flight duration per se. We believe that a flight of a few km may have been sufficient to allow the pigeons to extract some needed piece of environmental information which then allowed them to locate the home direction.

Although various theoretical models have specified the conditions for, and the extent and direction of conflict and cooperation, there are few empirical data to test their predictions. This paper reports such a test for the pied kingfisher (Ceryle rudis), a cooperatively breeding bird species with two types of male helpers: primary (= related) and secondary (= unrelated). In a breeding colony at Lake Victoria (Kenya), the birds were studied with regard to: (a) aggressive and non-aggressive interactions between breeders and helpers before and after chicks hatched; (b) frequency and effect of prey transfer from helpers to breeders; and (c) sizes and types of prey brought to females and nestlings. The six major results of the study and their explanations are as follows: Result 1. Male breeders attack secondary male helpers more often than primary helpers (Table 1). Expla- nation: Because of a high male surplus, all helpers are also potential rivals, competing with male breeders for sexual access to the scarce females. Secondary helpers, however, impose higher costs and lower bene- fits on the male breeders' fitness than do primary helpers. This is because they provide less help, seem to be more capable of fertilizing eggs in the year of help, are more likely to displace breeders in subsequent years, and are more distantly related to breeders than are primary helpers. Result 2. Primary helpers treat secondary helpers in the same way as male breeders do (Table 1). Explanation: Primary helpers are closely related to the young they raise. Therefore, any competition from secondary helpers that affects the breeder will decrease the primary helpers inclusive fitness. Result 3. Female breeders tolerate secondary helpers more readily than do male breeders and primary helpers (Table 1). Explanation: Females do not incur the costs of male-male competition; indeed they even benefit form it, because (a) with additional males (= secondary helpers) they get a better food supply during egg formation than without them, and (b) secondary helpers lower the females' food contributions to nestlings more than those of male breeders and primary helpers. Result 4. By offering fish, secondary helpers reduce the probability that they will be attacked the breeding pair and any primary helpers (Table 1). Explanation: The helpers' food transfer is interpreted as a "payment" for being accepted as a group member. Receiving fish improves the breeders' and primary helpers' energy-budgets and their chances of fledging young and thus reduces the cost/benefit ratio of tolerating helpers. For females this holds already during egg formation, for males only after hatching, when the risk of kleptogamy is low, and when helpers can improve survival of the young. Result 5. After the young have hatched, primary helpers carry more food to nestlings (_ usually their sibs) than to females, whereas secondary helpers carry more to females than to unrelated nestlings (Table 2 and Fig. 1). Explanation: Primary helpers increase their inclusive fitness mainly through raising close kin, secondary helpers mainly through improving their chances of finding a mate and reproducing themselves.</page><page sequence="82">724 VOLUME 96 Result 6. In groups with two or three secondary helpers, each helper tends to provide the nestlings with more food than in groups with only one helper (Fig. 2). Explanation: Groups with two or three secondary helpers differ from groups with only one helper (a) in the breeders' average gain from each helper, and (b) in the extent of male-male competition for females as prospective mates. The helpers' higher food contributions to nestlings in bigger groups is interpreted (a) as a higher payment for being tolerated, and (b) as increased effort to signal their parental qualities to the females. It is concluded that all behavioral interactions and food contributions closely reflect the costs and benefits of giving and receiving help, which vary with the sex of the breeder, the relatedness between the group members, and the period of the reproductive cycle. Behaviour Vol. 96 (1986) pp. 304-321 PREFERENTIAL BEHAVIOUR OF SAROTHERODON (OREOCHROMIS) MOSSAMBICUS (PISCES: CICHLIDAE) FRY TO MATERNAL MODELS AND ITS RELEVANCE TO THE CONCEPT OF IMPRINTING HOWARD I. RUSSOCK Department of Biological and Environmental Sciences, Western Connecticut State University, Danbury, Connecticut 06810 U.S.A. The effect of previous exposure on the later preferential responsiveness of Sarotherodon mossambicus fry to maternal models was investigated. All fry were removed from their mother's mouth as eggs and hatched and reared under artificial conditions so that they were never exposed to natural maternal stimuli. In all experimental groups fry were exposed to a maternal model on day 10 post-hatching (the first day they are normally released from the mother's mouth) and tested 24 h later for their preferential responsiveness toward two models. In Experiment I separate groups of fry were' exposed on day 10 to one of two maternal models of intermediate innate "attractiveness". Control fry exhibited no preferential behaviour on day 1 1 while all groups of experimental fry responded preferentially to the same ('split') model, regardless of the model to which they had been previously exposed. In Experiment II fry exposed for 15 or 60 min on day 10 responded preferentially to a potentially supernormal 'black pit' model as opposed to the 'split' model, again regardless of the model to which they had been previously exposed. In Experimental III groups of fry were exposed to one of two 'preserved female fish' models differed in the degree of contrast between their broody colouration and the background colouration of the fish; virtually no preferential behaviour was exhibited by these fry. The results showed that after fry have been exposed to maternal stimuli they will then respond preferentially to whichever model forms a closer match their initial perceptual schema of the broody mother. All experimental groups of fry in Experiment I responded preferentially to the 'split' model, regardless of which model they had previously been exposed to; the same pattern emerged in Experimental II. The fry failed to respond preferential in Experimental III possibly because they could not discriminate between the two models or because both models fit their initial perceptual schema equally well. It was concluded that while social bond formation in S. mossambicus fry is affected by early experience, there are stronger innate constrains on the process than would be expected from traditional studies of imprinting.</page><page sequence="83">VOLUME 97 725 Behaviour Vol. 97 (1986) pp. 1-9 INTERSPECIFIC ODOUR DISCRIMINATIONS AMONG SYNTOPIC CONGENERS IN SCINCID LIZARDS (GENUS EUMECES) WILLIAM E. COOPER, JR. Department of Biology, Auburn University at Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama 36193, U.S.A. LAURIE J. VITT Department of Biology, University of California, Los Angeles, California 90024, U.S.A. In a successive discrimination experiment several odours were presented to male Eumeces fasciatus on cotton-tipped applicators. The males displayed higher tongue-flick rates during a 60 second interval when responding to cloacal odours of conspecific females than to cloacal odours of females belonging to two very closely related species in the fasciatus group of Eumeces, water, or a pungency control. Similarly, male E. inexpectatus emitted higher tongue-flick rates to cloacal odors of conspecific females than to those of female E. fasciatus. Because male E. laticeps, which can follow female scent trails, also can discriminate conspecific from heterospecific female odors and because all three of these lizards tongue- flick repeatedly at the outsets of potential social encounters, chemical signals appear to be a basis for important social discriminations in the fasciatus group. Behaviour Vol. 97 (1986) pp. 10-36 HOW DO GREAT TIT (PARUS MAJOR) PAIR MATES COOPERATE IN BROOD DEFENCE? KLAUS REGELMANN and EBERHARD CURIO Arbeitsgruppe fur Verhaltensforschung, Abteilung fur Biologie, Ruhr-Universitat, Postfach 10 21 48, 4630 Bochum, F.R.G. Using economic theory CHASE (1980) predicted that a member of a group should contribute to the group's common interest, i.e. cooperate, as a function of the other members' contributions. In a group of two, e.g., a pair of parents caring for offspring, there are three possible stable equilibria of genuine cooperation: 1) Solely the male invests; 2) Solely the female invests; 3) Male and female invest into their common interest. It was examined in which of these ways members of great tit (Parus major) pairs cooperate while defending their nestlings and themselves against predatory danger of two sorts (owl (Glaucidium perlatum) + mixed mobbing chorus; the latter only). Employing multiway contingency analysis and information theoretic analysis it was also examined whether pair mates coordinate their defence among themselves. The experiments comprised of 1st and 2nd broods over five seasons in Lower Saxon wood plots. The following results were found: 1. Pair mates cooperate by confronting the danger jointly in 77.2% of all cases tested (n = 158 pairs). In pairs with only one mate cooperating it is more often the male (15.2%) than the female (3.2%) that contributes to defence. In only 4.4% of all pairs both pair mates display noncooperative behaviour. There is no difference among broods of a season and the stimuli employed. 2. During a defence episode, mates of 1 st brood pairs repeatedly approach the owl in succession jointly and withdraw from it likewise rather than alternate direction among each other's successive moves. The spatio- temporal dynamics implied in this synergism cannot be due to pair-specific environmental commonalities (brood, nest environs, etc.) at the time of the test, as is possible for the gross cooperation mentioned (1.); rather pair mates appear to gear their risk-taking to one another. From 5 to 29% of the variance of all moves' directions is thus explained by an influence of the mate's move. Another significant influence lies in a bird's own moves in that, on average, homing in on the danger and retreating from it, tend to alternate. The diminution of synergism between broods in both mates may be due to their becoming more familiar with their nest environs, as indicated both by comparison within the 1st brood and by a sexual difference in the strength of synergism. 3. In moving synergistically (see 2.), the male exerts a stronger facilitatory influence on the female than vice versa. This sex-specific effect abates between broods. The facilitatory effect on the mate tends to disappear after 15 to 30 s, i.e. tends to affect but the mate's next move in time. 4. Coordination of defence is also borne out by both mates homing in on the predatory danger more closely once both are present, as measured by their within-trial average distance from danger. This suggests for the first time that, apart from the accepted determinants of altruism, that the degree of altruism exhibited by a group member feeds back positively on that of another. A short term self-protection hypothesis for</page><page sequence="84">726 VOLUME 97 this type of synergism is rejected. Like the synergism of moving jointly (2.), this type of synergism is due to mutual positive feedback among the pair mates. 5. Between 1st and 2nd broods, the female's within-trial average distance from danger tends to relax both in the presence and in the absence of the male whereas the male's does not. This sex difference may be due to the male's greater interest in the pair's home range. Pestering a raptor with perseverence at an average distance tends to move it on. By contrast, the 2nd brood male's riskier, yet shorter-term minimum distance in the female's presence has relaxed, thus supporting a female-investment explanation for this measure. Behaviour Vol. 97 (1986) pp. 37-49 REPRODUCTIVE DOMINANCE WITHIN COLONIES OF BOMBUS TERRESTRIS (L.) JAN VAN DER BLOM Laboratory of Comparative Physiology, University of Utrecht, Jan van Galenstraat 40, 3572 LA Utrecht, The Netherlands The primitive character of eusociality in bumblebees is expressed in the fact that laying workers appear beside the laying queen and in the severe outbursts of aggression that coincide with this phenomenon. Egg cells of both the queen and the workers are destroyed and in many cases the queen is killed. In the eight colonies that were investigated it was found that the queen switched from laying fertilized eggs to laying unfertilized eggs within a short period. The time when haploid (unfertilized) eggs were produced was derived from the demographic data of the colonies and from our present knowledge of the developmental time of the workers, the queens and the males. Egg laying by workers and overt aggression never occurred until the queen had stopped laying fertilized eggs. As a result, the interests of diploid brood were not affected by the worker-queen conflict in the colonies. The possible meaning of a specific worker display towards the queen, the so-called 'buzzing behaviour', is discussed in terms of the worker-queen relation. Behaviour Vol. 97 (1986) pp. 50-65 SOCIAL DOMINANCE AND REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS IN A GOOSE FLOCK (ANSER INDICUS) JURG LAMPRECHT Max-Planck-Institut fur Verhaltensphysiologie, D-813 1 Seewiesen, F.R.G. To investigate how dominance affects annual reproductive success in a permanently monogamous species, social dominance of pairs in winter was compared with various components of subsequent fledging success in a semi-captive flock of bar-headed geese (Anser indicus). Other pair characteristics (age of mates and pairbond duration) were also analysed as they correlated with dominance and fledging success. In the two study years 1982 and 1983 the geese were provided with ad lib. food but an apparently limiting number of nest sites. - Nest search period: As future non-breeders were more often driven off nest sites than future breeders, although their frequencies of nest building behaviour were not significantly lower, apparently dominance rather that breeding propensity determined whether a pair bred. The inverse relationship with the frequency of being displaced at nest sites was stronger for dominance than for age and pairbond duration. - Incubation period: In 1982 nests were in solid boxes with only a narrow entrance. Disturbance risk was probably low, and none of the pair characteristics correlated with the number of young hatched (HS). In 1983 boxes were low-walled and open-topped, and all pair characteristics were associated with HS, dominance and female age most closely. Correlations with other parameters suggested three independent influences on HS: (1) Older male - higher dominance - more success in nest defence - fewer eggs lost or broken - higher HS, (2) older male - more nest attendance - higher HS, (3) older female - higher HS. - Young-rearing period: HS was the major determinant of variation in the number of goslings fledged per pair, while gosling survival did not significantly correlate with fledging success. - In an, experimental competitive feeding situation females of more dominant pairs showed higher peck rates. However, pack rates were unrelated to reproductive success in this study, as food was abundant at all other times. - The importance of male dominance for parental success may be the ultimate cause of sexual dimorphism (size and aggressiveness) in geese and swans.</page><page sequence="85">VOLUME 97 Behaviour Vol. 97 (1986) pp. 66-93 THE FEEDING BEHAVIOUR OF A SIT-AND-WAIT PREDATOR, RANATRA DISPAR, (HETEROPTERA: NEPIDAE): DESCRIPTION OF BEHAVIOURAL COMPONENTS OF PREY CAPTURE, AND THE EFFECT OF FOOD DEPRIVATION ON PREDATOR AROUSAL AND CAPTURE DYNAMICS PAUL C.E. BAILEY Department of Entomology, Waite Agricultural Research Institute, University of Adelaide, South Australia 5064 The components in the predatory behaviour of this typical sit-and-wait predator are described. The sequence of components follow a basic pattern, i.e. initial precapture posture, arousal, orientation, capture, consolidation of grip, exploration, injection of venom/enzymes, feeding, discard of prey. When tested with model prey of no nutritional value following increasing periods of fast R. dispar increased the initial exploratory time and the number of exploratory bouts before rejecting the prey. The predators arousal space is elliptical horizontally and almost circular vertically, the distance being greatest on front of the predator and decreasing to the rear. The strike and capture space of R. dispar is restricted to the space anterior to the predator and bounded by approximately 45° either side horizontally and 90° to -45° (315°) vertically. Both the arousal and strike space increase with food deprivation. The period of food deprivation significantly affects the strike distance up to a maximum of about 30 mm after a 120 hour fast. Presentation along some paths evokes more strikes, hits and captures than presentation along others, suggesting that there is an optimum region within the strike space where the capture efficiency is highest. Prey moving along the 0° path in the horizontal plane or either the 0° or 45° path in the vertical plane, evoke the highest number of strikes, and hits in well-fed predators, while the highest capture efficiency occurs when prey are moved on the 0° path. Following longer periods of fasting (&gt;72 hours) prey moved below the 0° axis (Vertical Plane) along the -45° (315°) path evoke as many strikes as the 0° and 45° paths. Although dynamic, the capture space is limited by the reach of the raptorial legs, there being no lunge or pursuit. The capture efficiency is about 76% and unaffected by food deprivation. Behaviour Vol. 97 (1986) pp. 94-117 SCENT MARKING WITH FAECES AND ANAL SECRETION IN THE EUROPEAN BADGER (MELES MELES): SEASONAL AND SPATIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF LATRINE USE IN RELATION TO TERRITORIALITY T.J. ROPER, D.J. SHEPHERDSON and J.M. DAVIES School of Biology, University of Sussex, Brighton BN1 9QG, U.K. Badgers (Meles meles) defecate and scent mark in open pits ('dung pits') which seem to have territorial significance. We carried out a year-round survey of badger defecation sites in order to assess seasonal and spatial characteristics of site use. Our results show that badgers defecate at two different types of site, which we refer to as 'latrines' and 'temporary defecation sites' (TDS's) respectively. Latrines are relatively large aggregations of dung pits (up to 25 separate pits) that are visited year-round; they are largest in spring (April) and autumn (October); they are more numerous around the perimeter of a territory; they are associated with fences and roads; and they often contain anal-gland secretion as well as faeces. TDS's, by contrast, are single dung pits or small aggregations of pits that are used only once or twice and are then abandoned; they are most numerous in mid-winter (December and January); they are scattered throughout the territory both close to and away from fences and roads; and they do not usually contain anal secretion. Spatial and seasonal changes in frequency of TDS's are shown to correlate with food availability and with foraging behaviour, and we conclude that TDS's have no special function beyond elimination of faeces. Latrines, however, do seem to have communicatory significance, and we conclude that they are concerned with territory defence. Since seasonal changes in latrine use correlate more closely with mating than with food availability we suggest that territoriality in badgers may be related more to defence of oestrus females by resident males than to defence of food resources. 727</page><page sequence="86">VOLUME 97 Behaviour Vol.97 (1986) pp. 118-146 SOCIAL RANK, DOMINANCE, ANTLER SIZE, AND ACCESS TO FOOD IN SNOW-BOUND WILD WOODLAND CARIBOU CYRILLE BARRE'I'E and DENIS VANDAL Departement de biologie, Universit6 Laval, Qu6bec, Canada, G1K 7P4 We spent two winters studying the social behaviour of wild woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) at a time when their main food (ground lichens; Cladina sp.) is available only at snow craters dug by the animals. The competition for access to such craters was severe, the animals constantly trying to take over the craters of others. During a two-month period when a group maintained a constant size (20) and composition (all age-sex classes represented), we could rank the animals in a rather linear dominance hierarchy (Landau's index = 0.87). Rank was correlated with access to resources, percent of time spent active, and percent of time feeding in craters. It was also correlated with age and antler size. However, rank is not an attribute of individuals, but of a relationship between individuals. As such it is only an intervening variable between physical attributes and access to resources, a variable whose value has meaning only within a given group. Among the three attributes studied (age, sex, antler size), the latter was by far the best predictor of the occurrence and outcome of interactions. Between two individuals within any of the three age-sex classes studied (adult and yearling males and adult females), the one with larger antlers initiated significantly more often, escalated its aggression (to the point of hitting the target) less often, and enjoyed a higher success rate in obtaining resources. When their antlers were larger than those of an adult male target (i.e. males that had shed their antlers), adult females won almost all their interactions with adult males even though they escalated only one fourth of them. This clarifies the long-standing speculation that female caribou have antlers and shed them later than males, in order to overcome their sexual handicap in competition for food in the winter. We conclude that the link between rank and dominance of an individual on one hand, and some of its attributes on the other (e.g. sex, age, weight, antler size) is fundamentally realized by the animal itself through its active preference for targets it is likely to beat, i.e. targets with smaller antlers. Behaviour Vol. 97 (1986) pp. 147-160 BETWEEN AND WITHIN POPULATION DIFFERENCES IN GEOTACTIC RESPONSE IN THE LAND SNAIL ARIANTA ARBUSTORUM (L.) (HEIICIDAE) BRUNO BAUR and MARGRET GOSTELI Zoological Museum, University of Zurich-Irchel, Winterthurerstr. 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland The crawling behaviour of individual Arianta arbustorum (L.) from a midland and an alpine site was compared on an increasingly inclined surface at two temperatures in the laboratory. Due to a negative geotactic response, A. arbustorum tends to move upward when placed on inclined surfaces. At 24°C, snails from the midlands showed a better accuracy of upward orientation than snails from the mountains, while at 16°C no difference was detectable. Snails from the midlands moved larger distances in three minutes than did those from the mountains. This might be due to the larger size of the midland snails. The distances covered in three minutes depended on the temperature and on the inclination of the surface and varied between individual snails. In repeated trials, individual snails showed consistent differences in dispersal behaviour, ranging from sedentariness to strong dispersal tendency. Such behaviour patterns are strengthened in alpine snails: individuals from the mountains-where the environment varies relatively more in time and space-were more variable in terms of movement patterns than snails from the midlands, where the environment is more homogeneous and stable.

RASMUSSEN Sub-Department of Animal Behaviour, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, England 1. In free-ranging troops of savannah baboons, adult males form temporary pair bonds or "consortships" with females in oestrus. Consort pairs are characterized by unusually close and continued proximity and exclusive sexual interaction; such pairs are typically found on the periphery of the troop. Changes in the 728</page><page sequence="87">VOLUME 97 729 spatial patterning of 13 adult male and 20 cycling adult female yellow baboons which occurred during consortships are reported. 2. Adult males were normally more peripheral to the troop than were adult females; hence the peripher- alisation of consort pairs involved much less change in the nearest neighbour patterns of adult males than it did in those of adult females. 3. Subordinate females were more peripheral and had fewer adult female and immature neighbours than dominant females, both during consortships and while not in consort. Nulliparous females who were not in consort generally had more neighbours close to them than did parous females. There was some tendency for low-ranking adult males to be more peripheral than high-ranking males when they were not in consort, but there was no relationship between peripherality and male agonistic rank during consortships. 4. Consort partners were within 5 m of each other on three-quarters of all interval samples, and were rarely observed more than 15 m apart. Partners were closest together during the ovulatory stage of the female's cycle, and farthest apart once the fertile stage had passed. Consort pairs were most peripheral to the troop during the ovulatory and pre-ovulatory stages of the female's cycle, and least peripheral on days following the fertile stage. 5. Evidence is presented which suggests that the female partner, rather than the male partner, may be responsible for the peripheralisation of consort pairs. Possible reasons why females might favour moving to the edge of the troop for mating are discussed. Behaviour Vol. 97 (1986) pp. 182-212 THE STRUCTURE OF COURTSHIP IN THE DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER SPECIES SUB-GROUP MATTHEW COBB, BARRIE BURNET and KEVIN CONNOLLY Departments of Psychology and Genetics, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, England A quantitative comparison and sequence analysis of courtship behaviour of four-day old virgin flies from seven species of the Drosophila melanogaster species subgroup is described. In three species (D. melanogaster, D. simulans and D. mauritiana) courtship was observed until copulation. In four species (D. yakuba, D. teissieri, D. erecta and D. orena) courtships were truncated after a standard period. Wing rowing by the male was seen in four species (simulans, mauritiana, yakuba and teissieri). In both mauritiana and simulans the proportion of time spent in rowing tended to increase as courtship proceeded. The four species showing the greatest proportion of wing vibration in courtship (melanogaster, yakuba, erecta and orena) also showed an increase in the proportion of time spent vibrating as courtship proceeded. The amount of wing vibration and wing extension in yakuba is greater than in any other species in the subgroup. The proportion of time spent in wing extension in yakuba declined whilst vibration increased during courtship. In six species the proportion of courtship time spent licking increased during courtship. The mean lick duration was longer in yakuba than in any other species of the subgroup. When males were following actively moving females the time they spent performing courtship behaviours and the mean bout lengths were shorter than in courtship as a whole. D. simulans males expressed scissoring at a low level when courting moving females. Females of all species preened more than the males, but preening during courtship appeared to have no excitatory or inhibitory effect on the male. The behavioural sequence characteristics of the species subgroup is orientation - wing display - licking - copulation. In five species wing vibration was the only element of wing display immediately to precede licking, but in simulans licking could also be preceded by scissoring and in yakuba by wing extension. The transition vibration - licking appears to be a characteristic of the subgroup.

The interactions between body size, nest size and prey size were investigated. 2. Spiders in larger nests caught larger prey than those in smaller nests. 3. The increase in prey availability did not keep pace with increasing spider numbers as nest size increased.</page><page sequence="88">730 VOLUME 97 4. This resulted in spiders from larger nests being smaller than those from smaller nests. 5. The most likely individuals to leave experimental groups were the intermediatesized ones. 6. Spiders were more active in the presence of plant defensive spines than in their absence. 7. Spiders from smaller nests were more cooperative and less competitive than those from larger nests. Behaviour Vol. 97 (1986) pp. 226-233 THE EFFECT OF GENETIC DRIFT ON MATING PROPENSITY, COURTSHIP BEHAVIOUR, AND POSTMATING FITNESS IN DROSOPHILA SIMULANS JOHN RINGO, KAREN BARTON and HAROLD DOWSE Department of Zoology, University of Maine, Orono, Maine 04469, U.S.A. Mating propensity, courtship behaviour, and components of postmating fitness were measured in two lines (C and M) of Drosophila simulans which had undergone genetic drift and in the highly outcrossed Base line (B) from which they were derived. B females had higher mating propensity and higher productivity than C-or M females, while the drift line females were courted more than B females. B males had higher mating propensity, greater virility (number of females inseminated), and lower productivity (number of offspring) than C or M males; the amount of courtship by B and C males was equal, and greater than that by M males. Thus, mating success was determined by the quantity and quality of male courtship and by the intrinsic propensity of females to mate. The negative correlation between male mating success and postmating fitness disproves for Drosophila HUXLEY'S (1938) hypothesis than intersexual selection does not occur.

Male Nannophya pygmaea defend small territories on or near small bodies of water. Sexually receptive females arrive at these sites to oviposit, and are usually intercepted by these territorial males. 2. Not all males are territorial however, some try to 'sneak' copulations with females attracted to estab- lished territories. 3. Males are both residents and sneakers at some stage of their life. 4. Number of sneakers increase at an accelerating rate with male density at the reproductive area. 5. Some territorial sites are occupied more consistently than others, and there is considerable turnover in territory ownership at some sites during the course of the reproductive season. 6. Some changes in ownership occur because an intruder defeats the resident in an aerial contest. 7. Highly contended territorial sites attract more females than others, and daily mating frequency is highest in males occupying these territories. 8. However, "sneakers" appear to be as successful in gaining copulations as males who occupy less contended territories.

At low numbers (4 o'c, 4 yy-6 cI'o, 8 99) the linear rank-order</page><page sequence="89">VOLUME 97 731 among the males was the most obvious characteristic of social structure. The alpha male's dominance was not locality dependent. He defended all females against all males. Attaining the alpha position was the most successful male reproductive strategy within this dominance structured system. At high numbers (7 cde, 9 9y-12 eoe, 12 yy) a different, more complex social organization developed. Long-lasting social relationship between individual males and females as well as spatial relationships became predominant. The individuals filled different social positions which remained stable for months. The males could be divided into three different categories: 1. 'Owners', who lived together with 1 to 7 females, mainly in non-overlapping territorial areas, and who probably reproduced with these females. Their main strategy of enlarging their number of females was to recruit juvenile previously 'unowned' females into their harems. 2. Non-owners, who were dominated by the owners, formed preferences for the owners' females and, by displaying this strategy, usually attained ownership later. 3. The lowest ranking 'omega' males who were withdrawn from most social interactions. Their status can be viewed as a bad state with alternative options missing. The change of social organization took place within one month. It is seen as a mechanism to facilitate adjustment to increasing population density. The change may be instigated when it is no longer economical for the alpha male to monopolize all females and he therefore adopts an alternative reproductive strategy to maximize his fitness. The proximate factor releasing the change, may be the increasing number of fights between the alpha and beta males observed during this period. Behaviour Vol. 97 (1986) pp. 273-296 VOCAL INTERACTIONS BETWEEN UNFAMILIAR GROUPS OF CAPTIVE COTTON-TOP TAMARINS PATRICIA B. McCONNELL and CHARLES T. SNOWDON Department of Zoology and Psychology, c/o Birge Hall University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin 53706, U.S.A. Vocal interactions between captive groups of cotton-top tamarins (Saguinus oedipus oedipus) were studied by simulating encounters between unfamiliar groups. The doors were opened between pairs of colony rooms resulting in an increased amplitude of the normal intragroup vocalizations of an unfamiliar group. After several seconds, some groups began Long Calling bouts, complex exchanges of calls accompanied by behavioral patterns seen only in encounters between unfamiliar groups. The behavior patterns included increased scent marking and piloerection and decreased huddling compared with a control condition. Both the behavioral patterns and the vocalizations were similar to those observed in intergroup encounters in the wild. The vocalizations of each group were recorded on separate channels and subsequently identified through a real time spectrum analyzer. Four different calls appeared at significantly higher rates during the Long Calling bout: Females tended to give normal Long Calls and males tended to give F chirps. F chirps progressed into F Chirp trills which were also given primarily by males. F Chirp-Whistle vocalization, a combination of the F Chirp and the Normal Long Call, were given equally by both sexes. A surprising result was that only mated pairs without off-spring participated in the Long Calling bouts. Family groups showed little vocal or behavioral response to hearing acoustically unfamiliar groups. Information theory analysis was used to analyze the transitions between call types and between groups. The production of several call types was shown to be dependent on both the preceding call type and the group of origin of that call. In general the progression from one call type to another occurred within the same group, while the other, unfamiliar group tended to repeat the call that it heard from the first group. The results are discussed in the context of the known social structure of the tamarins in the wild and in the context of the vocal exchanges of avian species with similar social systems. Continued fine-grain analysis of vocal exchanges should lead to an enhanced understanding of the structure and social complexity of vocal communication in nonhuman primates.</page><page sequence="90">732 VOLUME 97 Behaviour Vol. 97 (1986) pp. 297-307 INTERSPECIFIC INTERACTIONS OF COMMUNAL JUMPING SPIDERS (ARANEAE, SALTICIDAE) FROM KENYA: MECHANISMS OF SEX- AND SPECIES-RECOGNITION ROBERT R. JACKSON Department of Zoology, University of Canterbury, Christchurch 1, New Zealand Menemerus, Pseudicius sp. 1, and Pseudicius 2 are communal salticids that live in very large interspecific nest complexes, a habit which is highly unusual for cursorial spiders. Cohabitation with communal, territorial web-building spiders is another unusual characteristic of these species, their nest complexes being built within the alien webbing. Distinct courtship versatility occurs in each species: the male performs visual (Type 1) courtship away from nest and vibratory (Type 2) courtship at nests, and he cohabits with subadult females in nests and mates with them when they mature. Different display behaviour occurs during intraspecific male-male interactions, but minimal interaction occurs between conspecific females. Distinct differences occur in the display behaviours of the different species. Little interaction occurs between the three species, and the hypothesis that display differences are important in species recognition is not supported. Apparently, interspecific discrimination occurs routinely by means other than by displays both at and away from nests. At nests, contact with the silk, even in the absence of the female, enables males to make species- and sex-discriminations. Pheromones are probably involved. The emphasis traditionally given to species-recognition in discussions of salticid display behaviour is probably inappropriate. Behaviour Vol. 97 (1986) pp. 308-324 DEMOGRAPHY AND THE EVOLUTION OF COOPERATIVE BREEDING IN THE BICOLORED WREN, CAMP YLORHYNCHUS GRISEUS STEVEN N. AUSTAD and KERRY N. RABENOLD Department of Biological Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907, U.S.A. 1. Two adjacent populations of the bicolored wren differ significantly in social structure. In one population 83% of groups consist of unaided pairs. The rest contain, in addition, a single male nonreproductive helper. About 43% of the groups in the other population consist of unaided pairs. The rest contain from one to three helpers, and helpers may be of either sex. 2. Helpers are always individuals who have failed to disperse from their natal territory. In both populations they augment group reproductive success and reduce mortality among the breeding pair, although a single helper produces a reproductive enhancement as great as that of multiple helpers. 3. Group-size-specific reproduction and adult mortality do not differ between the populations, but juvenile mortality and average territory size differ significantly. 4. The population consequences of these differences suggest that group size is held below its optimum in one habitat by high juvenile mortality, whereas habitat saturation is probably responsible for the fact that about one-third of all groups in the second habitat contain more than an optimum number of members. 5. These demographic parameters suggest that habitat saturation is not a necessary condition for the maintenance of helping behavior in either population.</page><page sequence="91">VOLUME 98 733 Behaviour Vol.98 (1986) pp. 1-144 AGGRESSIVENESS IN STICKLEBACKS (GASTEROSTEUS ACULEATUS L.): A BEHAVIOUR-GENETIC STUDY THEO C.M. BAKKER Ethology Department, Zoological Laboratory, University of Leiden, P.O.B. 9516, 2300 RA Leiden, The Netherlands This behaviour-genetic study concentrates on intra-specific aggressiveness in the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus L., forma leiura). Aggressiveness was studied under standardized conditions in five different test situations, referred to as juvenile aggressiveness, female aggressiveness, territorial aggressiveness, courtship aggressiveness, or dominance ability. The aim of the study is two-fold: 1. To assess the extent to which variation of aggressiveness in each of the different test situations is attributable to genetic causes. 2. To asses the extent to which variation in these various manifestations of aggressiveness is influenced by common genetic factors. The paper starts with an analysis of the variation of aggressiveness in the base population, composed of individually isolated progeny of wild-caught parents (chapter 2). In each of the different test situations aggressiveness is highly variable across individuals. Repeated measurements with the same individuals as well as similarity of the levels of aggression between full sibs shows that phenotypic variation is to a considerable extent attributable to genotypic variation in each of the investigated situations. The genetic influence on variation of aggressiveness is further analysed with the aid of selection exper- iments (chapter 3). Bidirectional selection is exerted upon juvenile aggressiveness in juveniles of both sexes (juvenile aggression lines), upon territorial aggressiveness in males and female aggressiveness in adult females (territorial aggression lines), and lastly, upon dominance ability in males (dominance lines). Besides these six selection lines an unselected control line was maintained. Selection is highly successful in downward direction in each of the different contexts. However, enhance- ment of the level of aggression is less successful in most lines, with the exception of female aggressiveness. Possible causes for these asymmetries of responses are discussed in detail. It is argued that the lack of response in males to selection for territorial aggressiveness and dominance ability in upward directions is probably due to an upper selection limit for territorial aggressiveness and dominance ability, that is already present in the base population. The combined two-way responses yield heritability-estimates of at least 0.30 for aggressiveness in the different test situations. In the single selection lines the realized heritabilities range from 0 to at least 0.60. Across individuals of the base population the levels of aggression in the different test situations are correlated with each other to various degrees. In females there is a distinctly positive phenotypic correlation between juvenile and female aggressiveness, but in males correlations between juvenile, territorial and courtship aggressiveness are weaker. Dominance ability is uncorrelated with aggressiveness in the other test situations. Since fish of the various selection lines are not only scored for their aggressiveness in the particular situation in which they are selected, but also for their aggressiveness in the other test situations, these phenotypic correlations can be translated into genetic correlations (chapter 4). The genetic correlations between the levels of aggression in the different test situations are comparable to the corresponding phenotypic correlations. The genetic basis of juvenile aggressiveness is most likely identical for both juvenile males and juvenile females. In adult females variation of aggressiveness remains most likely governed by the same genetic factors. The genetic factors that contribute to variation of territorial aggressiveness are only partly identical to those that contribute to variation of juvenile aggressiveness. Changes of courtship aggressiveness parallel those of territorial aggressiveness in the various selection lines, suggesting that common genetic influences underlie variation in both manifestations of intra-specific aggressiveness in reproductive males. Lastly, variation of dominance ability is probably governed by genetic factors different from those governing variation of juvenile or territorial aggressiveness. Indirect determination of the level of androgens in reproductive males of the various selection lines, by means of kidney-size measurements, reveals that selection for territorial aggressiveness most likely acts on the level of androgens. In view of changes accompanying selection for juvenile aggressiveness (viz. a difference between high and low line fish in age at sexual maturity, in age at onset of juvenile aggression, and in incidence of ripeness) selection for juvenile aggressiveness likely acts on the level of gonadotropic hormones. Finally, selection for dominance ability acts on factors (probably androgenindependent) that influence the brightness of colouration. Throughout this paper the influence of a number of variables on aggressiveness in the various test situations, such as age, degree of ripeness, location of the nest, age of sexual maturity, experience, length, isolation and responsiveness, are analysed. Furthermore, attention is paid to threatening displays, to a peculiar</page><page sequence="92">734 VOLUME 98 behaviour called snapping at air-bubbles, to aggressiveness of juveniles in groups of fixed size, and to measures of aggressiveness other than the criterion applied during selection in a particular situation. Finally, the literature is reviewed with respect to selection studies on aggressiveness and to selective forces acting on aggressiveness in the three-spined stickleback. Behaviour Vol. 98 (1986) pp. 145-167 CHANGES IN BEHAVIOR WITH INCREASING EXPERIENCE WITH NOVEL PREY IN FRY OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN CICHLID, CICHLASOMA MANAGUENSE (TELEOSTEI: CICHLIDAE) AXEL MEYER Department of Zoology and Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720, U.S.A. With increasing experience with the novel prey, Daphnia, the fish became less hesitant to attack Daphnia. The fish took fewer nonprey items per prey item with increased experience. They also became more efficient in handling the novel prey. There was no indication of the formation of a search image. The multiple regression model revealed that, although the fish grew during the experimental period, their increased size did not contribute significantly to the increase in capture success. Contrary to previous studies size did not influence capture success within the size range used in these experiments. The individual variation in capture success was large in all groups of Cichlasoma managuense. The most successful predators were the fish who persistantly attempted to catch prey and had the highest number of previous experiences with the novel prey. The morphological variable weight was negatively correlated with capture success, which may suggest that a hungrier fish is more motivated to prey and a more successful predator. An increase in eye diameter brought about an increase in capture success, due probably to an increased visual acuity, hence it may suggest a possible ecological effect of this morphological variable. Behaviour Vol.98 (1986) pp. 168-179 HABITAT, GROUP SIZE, AND THE BEHAVIOUR OF WHITE-TAILED DEER KIRK E. LAGORY Department of Zoology, Miami University, Oxford, Ohio 45056 and Savannah River Ecology Laboratory, P.O. Drawer E, Aiken, South Carolina 29801, U.S.A. The behaviour of white-tailed deer on Ossabaw Island, Georgia was examined in three habitats which differed in cover density and forage abundance. Forest had relatively dense cover but low forage avail- ability; wooded pasture had relatively dense cover and abundant forage; open pasture had no woody cover but abundant forage. Deer groups were small in both the forest and the wooded pasture relative to groups in the open pasture. Group size in the open pasture did not vary with seasonal changes in forage supply. Groups were small in open pasture during the autumn rut when food was abundant, but were relatively large at other times of year, even during the winter when forage abundance was comparable to that in the forest. Deer in the open pasture spent more time feeding, less time moving, and less time alert than did deer in the forest. Deer in the wooded pasture were intermediate between deer in the other two habitats for percent time feeding, more similar to deer in the open pasture for percent time moving, and more like deer in the forest for percent time alert. Differences in alert behaviour suggest that deer in dense vege- tation (e.g. forest and wooded pasture) were more wary than deer in open areas. In all habitats, deer in larger groups (four or more deer) spent more time feeding and less time alert than deer in smaller groups. More aggressive interactions were seen in the open pasture; more nonaggressive interactions were seen in the forest. The rate of aggressive interaction was not clearly related to group size. Temporal variation in nearest-neighbor distance within groups was greater in the forest than in the open pasture, possibly due to loss of contact between deer under conditions of restricted visibility. Although these data suggest that cover density rather than forage characteristics was related to deer group size, no support was given for the hypothesis that this relationship was a consequence of different anti-predator strategies. Groups may have been smaller in dense vegetation because deer had difficulty maintaining contact with other group members when visibility was restricted.</page><page sequence="93">VOLUME 98 735 Behaviour Vol. 98 (1986) pp. 180-212 SIMILAR BEHAVIOUR AND COLOUR PATTERNS IN 3 NOT CLOSELY RELATED BARBUS SPECIES. IS EVOLUTIONARY CONVERGENCE A LIKELY EXPLANATION? (BARB US NIGROFASCIATUS GUNTHER, 1868, B. FILAMENTOSUS (CUV. &amp; VAL. 1844), B. LATERISTRIGA CUV. &amp; VAL. 1842; PISCES, CYPRINIDAE) K. KORTMULDER Zoological Laboratory, University of Leiden, Postbox 9516, 2300 RA Leiden, The Netherlands The main theoretical issue of this paper is the interpretation of the close similarity of the total behaviour and colour patterns of 3 not closely related Barbus species. The case for evolutionary convergence is easy if the total pattern of each species is interpreted as a collection of evolutionary adaptations to the species' natural habitat. The thorough similarity of the 3 species must then be ascribed to key similarities between their natural habitats. However, it is argued that another interpretation is possible, in which the diverse traits cohere causally and have been acted upon as one whole by natural selection. In the extreme case of this alternative interpretation, the case for convergence may still be won, but it is a Pyrrhic victory: convergence has lost much of its usual meaning. Apart from the above discussion, the reproductive behaviour and spawning colours of the 3 species are described and compared in some detail. Possible functional reasons for a relatively small difference as to the degree of sexual colour dimorphism are discussed in relation to eye sizes and visual discrimination. Behaviour Vol. 98 (1986) pp. 213-239 COMMUNICATION BY AGONISTIC DISPLAYS: 1. VARIATION IN INFORMATION CONTENT BETWEEN SAMPLES D. PATON and P.G. CARYL Department of Psychology, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland, U.K. 1. Great skuas Stercorarius skua use a range of displays in agonistic interactions in the club areas of their breeding colonies. We examine whether these displays allow reliable prediction of the signaller's future behaviour. 2. Skuas were studied on Noss, Fair Isle and Hoy over 3 seasons. Data from 5 colony-year samples were analysed separately. For each interaction, the display used, the signaller's action after displaying, and the receiver's response, were recorded. 3. Attack could be predicted less well than escape. However, variations between samples were so great that neither the absolute nor the relative probabilities of attack or escape could be reliably estimated from the display. 4. The bird that initiated the interaction was more likely to attack or stay, and less likely to escape, then its rival, but the relative probability of attack or escape after different displays was consistent, for birds in the two roles, within a sample. 5. By correlating the responses of the receiver with information about the signaller's future behaviour encoded in its display, it is possible to find whether this information is transferred in the interaction. There was variation between samples in the pattern of correlations, and no consistent evidence of information transfer could be found. 6. The data are discussed in the light of CARYL'S (1979) earlier discussion of models from games theory. The results show that a test of consistency is crucial for any hypothesis about the message carried by a particular display. They indicate that skua displays do not communicate intention in these interactions.</page><page sequence="94">736 VOLUME 98 Behaviour Vol. 98 (1986) pp. 240-258 THE INFLUENCE OF GROUP SIZE ON PREDATOR SCANNING AND FORAGING BEHAVIOUR OF WEDGECAPPED CAPUCHIN MONKEYS (CEBUS OLJVACEUS) JAN R. DE RUITER Laboratory of Comparative Physiology, University of Utrecht, and Zoological Laboratory, University of Groningen, The Netherlands The behaviour of two groups of wedgecapped capuchin monkeys, Cebus olivaceus, a small one (n = 8) and a large one (n = 25) was recorded. Time budgets and other aspects of behaviour depended on group size. The differences can be explained as: adjustment to predation risk and intra-group food competition. In order to evade predation, members of the small groups scan more and stay at greater heights than those of the large group. Higher food competition within the large group was reflected in the composition of its diet. in longer travel distances, and higher levels of social behaviour. In particular during the dry season, the large group exploited unattractive and risky food sources. These results support ALEXANDER'S hypothesis on the causes of group formation. Behaviour Vol. 98 (1986) pp. 259-273 TEMPORAL AND STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS OF AFFILIATIVE VOCAL EXCHANGES IN SQUIRREL MONKEYS (SAIMIRI SCIUREUS) MAXEEN BIBEN, DAVID SYMMES and NOBUO MASATAKA Laboratory of Comparative Ethology, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Bldg T-18 (NIHAC) Bethesda, MD. 20892, U.S.A. Affiliative, aggressive, and vocal behaviors were observed in a group of five adult female squirrel monkeys. Affiliative partner preferences were correlated with use of the chuck vocalization. Mutually preferred partners exchanged chucks more often and with shorter latencies of response. Animals with few affiliative contacts were more likely to repeat themselves, and to obtain responses at longer latencies. Chuck exchanges neither follow nor precede changes in nonvocal behavior. Structural differences associated with the position of a chuck within a sequence were found. The peak frequency attained by several acoustic features of chucks was higher in chucks that followed closely another chuck compared with chucks that followed a silent period. We have termed these vocalizations "answer" and "question" chucks respectively. Among answer chucks, those that terminate an exchange have higher peak frequencies then those that become part of a longer sequence. These results are viewed as evidence for flexible use of signals in an exclusively linguistic context, and may be an example of categorical prosody.

However, the effects of the geographical location and other species in song communities are greater than that of habitat. The birds also seem to be able to improve their long distance communication easier by change in singing behaviour than by change in song-structure. The thrush nightingale males in the northerm population improved detectability of their song by singing at midnight when most other species in the bird community are silent. At the same time the males increased song length and decreased intersong pauses, which increased their total vocalizing time and improved the receivers' possibility to detect their acoustic information. This strategy presumably improves rapid pair formation, which is important for long distance migrants in the northern latitudes with short favorable season for breeding and subsequent moulting.</page><page sequence="95">VOLUME 98 737 Behaviour Vol. 98 (1986) pp. 286-304 FACTORS AFFECTING THE STRUCTURE OF SONG AND THE SINGING BEHAVIOUR OF SOME NORTHERN EUROPEAN PASSERINE BIRDS JORMA SORJONEN Department of Biology, University of Joensuu, Box 111, SF-80101 Joensuu 10, Finland In this study the effects of bird size, genus, habitat, song community and geographical distribution on song structure and singing behaviour of some passerine species in northern Europe were simultaneously studied. Most species tend to improve their long distance song propagation in their specific habitat and song community. Song propagation correlates strongest with the use of low-pitched elements but not all birds are able to use these because of size limitation. In forest habitats whistles and modulated elements were used to improve song propagation. In open habitats high-pitched elements as well as repeated and trilled syllables were often used for better propagation of acoustic information. In song communities with a great number of species, the birds reduce song interference by other singers, by singing short songs and using modulated elements and long intersong pauses. When the birds greatly profit from effective long distance song propagation, like in northern areas with only short time for pair formation, the birds can segregate in singing time by using the light nights for singing. In these communities with low numbers of species the birds have been freed from song interference and have long songs and short intersong pauses and they can increase in this way their singing rate. The effect of song community on song length, intersong pause and the use of modulated elements in the song is stronger than that of habitat. The effect of the song community increases towards the north. Behaviour Vol. 98 (1986) pp. 305-319 ACOUSTIC COMMUNICATION IN WOODHOUSE'S TOAD (BUFO WOODHOUSEI) 1. RESPONSE OF CALLING MALES TO VARIATION IN SPECTRAL AND TEMPORAL COMPONENTS OF ADVERTISEMENT CALLS BRIAN K. SULLIVAN and MARJORIE R. LEEK Department of Zoology, and Department of Speech and Hearing Science, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona 85287, U.S.A. We investigated changes in calling behavior of individual male Bufo woodhousei in response to playback of natural and synthetic acoustic stimuli. Males lowered their call rates and avoided acoustic overlap with all stimuli centered at 1.4 kHz; only a high frequency (3.8 kHz) stimulus was ineffective. Even filtered noise centered at 1.4 kHz was an effective inhibitor of calling activity. Variation in rate of amplitude modulation of acoustic stimuli had no apparent effect on male calling behavior. These results are discussed in relation to species recognition in bufonids, and acoustic competition between male anurans in general. Behaviour Vol. 98 (1986) pp. 320-360 THE BEHAVIOR OF APLYSIA CALIFORNICA COOPER (GASTROPODA; OPISTHOBRANCHIA): I. ETHOGRAM JANET L. LEONARD and KEN LUKOWIAK Department of Medical Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada T2N 4N1 Aplysia californica has been extremely popular with neurophysiologists interested in understanding the neural basis of behavior. The major drawback to neuroethological work on this species has been the lack of information on its behavior. We present the first ethogram of this species and a model of the physiological organization of drives (motivational systems) in Aplysia. The ethogram of A. californica contains 45 action patterns, most of which involve relatively subtle movements or postures of the head. Some of these action patterns have been studied physiologically and we summarize that information. The action patterns are superimposable and an individual may perform several action paterns simultaneously. A. californica has five distinct "drives" or motivational systems: feeding, escape, reproduction as a male, reproduction as a female and spawning. The sequence of events involved in escape behavior in response to attack by Navanax (a natural predator) or other mechanical stimuli to the rear is described.</page><page sequence="96">738 VOLUME 98 Each "drive" activates a particular sequence of action patterns, and certain "drives" are superimposable. Aplysia can copulate as a female while copulating as a male, feeding, or laying eggs. On the other hand, escape is incompatible with female sexual behavior. The available physiological evidence suggests that neuropeptides may play an important role in the organization of drives and their interactions. We present a model which combines the available physiological and behavioral data with the classical ethological drive hypothesis to produce a testable model of the physiological organization of motivation in Aplysia.

By encoding, the wren constructs his song in such a way that it can take advantage of most of these strategies. By decoding, it does not use all the strategies which encoding has made available. The choise and number of those which are used is a function of difficulties which the bird will encounter in recognizing the song of its own species. For instance, the duration or even the existence of silences between the notes are not taken into account. The bird uses them only to remove a difficulty about elements recognition. In this manner it is possible to explain the effectiveness and reliability of song as a means of communi- cation.</page><page sequence="97">VOLUME 99 739 Behaviour Vol. 99 (1986) pp. 1-21 FORAGING PATH SELECTION IN BUMBLEBEES: HINDSIGHT OR FORESIGHT? ROBERTA LYNN SOLTZ Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California, Irvine, California, U.S.A. Inflorescence richness and density did not effect the magnitude or variation in magnitude of the turn- ing angles between inflorescences in the paths of foraging bumblebees. The pooled data indicated that bumblebees tended to move straight through the Vicia patch regardless of raceme density. The angular distributions from the field data were similar to those derived from a computer model in which consumers just visited the nearest inflorescences provided that they revisited few flowers. These results imply that the foraging paths of bumblebees may be determined, in part, by a tendency to visit nearest inflorescences. The distribution of turning angles from individual rather than pooled data, however, suggest that active selection of inflorescences with between two and six flowers may also play a role in determining the for- aging path. I found no evidence for area-restricted foraging. This may be due to the heterogeneity of the natural resource patches.

TURNER and CLAUDIA MERTENS Ethology and Wildlife Research, Institute of Zoology, University of Zurich-Irchel, 8057, Zurich, Switzerland Home range size, overlap and exploitation in domestic farm cats is examined. Data were collected on the 11 adult cats (5 dd; 6 99) living on 3 Swiss farms throughout 1984; 8 of the cats were fitted with radio transmitters. Census-point and focal animal methods of data collection were employed. From area-observation curves we concluded that our home range maps (and sizes) were good approxi- mations of the areas utilized by the animals in 1984. Correlations existed between range size and 1) the number of map-fields visited per day by the cat (+); 2) the percentage of observations at the primary home (-); 3) the proportion of the range visited each day (-); and 4) the percentage of map-fields used only by one cat (+, but only for males). The general pattern of social organization found elsewhere was confirmed: males were generally more tolerant of each other than females (based on range overlap), especially considering animals living on different farms. Animals from the same primary home showed considerable range overlap. Male ranges were much smaller than expected (not even twice as large as the female ranges, whereas they should have been about 10 times the size, based on all other studies). These results are discussed in connection with male reproductive strategies, cat density and patterns of range utilization. And lastly, we could demonstrate coordination of hunting activity in time and space by two adult individ- uals on one farm (sibs), adding to the list of behavior patterns illustrating facultative sociality of house cats. Behaviour Vol. 99 (1986) pp. 46-64 CONTRASTS IN THE SONGS OF TWO SYMPATRIC CHAFFINCH SPECIES P.J.B. SLATER and P.J. SELLAR Department of Zoology and Marine Biology, University of St. Andrews, Fife, U.K. Recordings have been made of 13 blue chaffinches Fringilla teydea and of 19 Canary islands chaffinches F coelebs tintillon at various different sites on Tenerife. These are compared with chaffinch songs from elsewhere, where the blue chaffinch does not occur, as well as with each other. In both species on Tenerife, the final elements in the song are often repeated, and hybrid songs can occur on the transition from a bout of one song type to a bout of another. Neither of these features is typical of chaffinches in Britain: they may have arisen in their common ancestor or be due to convergence. In many other respects the two species have diverged so that they differ from chaffinches in Britain and Europe in opposite ways. The blue chaffinch typically has only a few brief elements of only one two types in the trill. These are separated by long gaps and there is a long, stereotyped and very characteristic flourish. Individuals have a small repertoire of 1-3 song types. In the Canary islands chaffinch the song has very long elements and the flourish is not clearly separated from the rest of the song. Some birds have 7 song types, more</page><page sequence="98">740 VOLUME 99 than any recorded elsewhere; in others sequencing is variable so that the songs cannot be easily split into types. These results suggest divergence in sympatry, but data are not yet sufficient to decide whether the divergence is greater were territories of the two species overlap than it is elsewhere. An alternative explanation, that the differences have arisen through differences in habitat between the two species, is less likely. Behaviour Vol. 99 (1986) pp. 65-86 PREDICTIONS FROM THE RANGING HYPOTHESIS FOR THE EVOLUTION OF LONG DISTANCE SIGNALS IN BIRDS EUGENE S. MORTON Department of Zoological Research, Smithsonian Institution, National Zoological Park, Washington, D.C. 20008, U.S.A. The Ranging Hypothesis (RH) (MORTON, 1982) proposed a form of distance assessment (ranging) based upon perception of signal degradation using memorized signals as a yardstick to distance. The predictions of the RH include distance assessment mechanisms, DAMs; it is proposed that these have opened a new evolutionary process illustrated by the complicated songs and singing behaviour in the oscine passerines ("songbirds"). The RH identifies sources of selection favouring learning, multiple or single song types, song structural complexity not accounted for by species isolating mechanism ideas, and emphasizes the ecological basis for the evolution of long distance communication. New importance is given to the acoustic physical structure of songs. The RH encompasses and contrasts song evolution in warm climate regions with those in cold temperate climates. Three interrelated stages of long distance signal evolution are presented: detectability, threat, and disrupt. A singer/listener role dichotomy in selective pressures is described and the results discussed. Listeners developed distance assessment mechanisms (DAMs) resulting in an evolutionary arms race between listeners and singers. Singers developed methods to use DAMs to their best interest (threat and disrupt). Song learning in passerines developed in response to this arms race to enhance disruption, a situation most prevalent in cold temperature zone regions. The acoustic determinants of effective song distance are described and discussed in relation to the evolution of signal structures. Finally, the RH is discussed in relation to some previous hypotheses on song function and evolution. Behaviour Vol. 99 (1986) pp. 87-100 THE FUNCTIONAL SIGNIFICANCE OF VOCAL MIMICRY IN SONG ANDREW M. HINDMARSH Edward Grey Institute of Field Ornithology, Department of Zoology, Oxford, England The results of a study of starling vocal mimicry are summarised and discussed in relation to various possible functional explanations of mimicry. Only one, a hypothesis based on sexual selection, is not rejected outright and even this was seen to have problems. A different approach yielded a causal hypothesis based on mistakes made during song learning. This causal hypothesis is consistent with all known features of starling mimicry, and can readily be extended to other species, but is probably not consistent with any of the candidate functional hypotheses, including the one based on sexual selection. It is tentatively concluded that there is no additional functional explanation of starling vocal mimicry. Behaviour Vol.99 (1986) pp. 101-116 DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS OF "ALARM" CALLING FOR DIFFERENT TIME SCALES: A PRELIMINARY REPORT ON GROUND SQUIRRELS DONALD H. OWINGS, DAVID F. HENNESSY and A. BECKETT GLADNEY Department of Psychology, University of California, Davis, Calif., 95616 U.S.A. DANIEL W. LEGER Department of Psychology, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, Nebr., 68588 U.S.A. The predator-evoked calling of California ground squirrels (Spermophilus beecheyi) was studied in the field during the reproductive season. Three different sources of data indicated that adults call more after, than before their young have reached the age of first emergence from natal burrows. During exposure to</page><page sequence="99">VOLUME 99 741 a tethered rattlesnake (Crotalus viridis oreganus) and to a freely-moving dog (Canis familiaris), and in natural encounters with a coyote (Canis latrans) or bobcat (Lynx rufus), calling was more frequent after than before young first emerged. We concluded that California ground squirrels call in order to warn their offspring about predators, like other ground squirrel species do. In order to see the increase in mammalian predator evoked calling after pup emergence, we had to separate calling on the basis of its temporal organization. Nonrepetitive calling involved spacing a few vocalizations irregularly in time. Calls patterned in this way were more common early in an encounter, became more frequent after pup emergence, and more consistently elicited immediate reactions. Such calling was probably used to warn pups. Repetitive calling comprised rhythmic emission of a series of vocalizations. Calls organized repetitively were more common later in an encounter, were not emitted more frequently after pup emergence, and less consistently evoked immediate reactions. These and other differences between the two temporal patterns of vocalizing led us to propose that repetitive calling represented a "tonic" communicatory effort (as in SCHLEIDT, 1973). Repetitive inputs to other squirrels may act "cumulatively" in a longer time scale than nonrepetitive calling, so as to cultivate or maintain vigilance in other squirrels. The repetitive caller could benefit by using the enhanced reactions of these more vigilant squirrels as a source of information about the predator. We propose that predator-prey episodes may be understandable from an "epigenetic" perspective. That is, the first alarm calls during an encounter should shift squirrels from an unwarned to a warned status; subsequent calling must then function in some other way than as a warning. Behaviour Vol. 99 (1986) pp. 117-138 DEVELOPMENTAL CHANGES IN THE CARAVANING BEHAVIOUR OF THE HOUSE MUSK SHREW (SUNCUS MURINUS) KEIICHIRO TSUJI, TAKASHI MATSUO and TOMOHIKO ISHIKAWA Department of Psychology, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan Development of caravaning behaviour in the house musk shrew (Suncus murinus) was described in detail and discussed in relation to sensory and motor development. With age of pups, caravaning changed in its formation pattern (I-V) as well as its quantitative aspects such as frequency of occurrence, duration and distance. The shift in formation pattern from II to III was simultaneous with the onset of vision (Experiment I). In darkness, frequency of caravaning significantly decreased at ages later than 11 days. This was due to the selective disappearance of Patterns III and V (Experiment II). These findings suggest the role of vision in caravan formation at the later stage of the period of occurrence. After the onset of vision, caravaning is released mostly by visual motion of the object, whereas caravaning at the earlier stage is released nonvisually. Caravaning and the pup's locomotor activity were suppressed and delayed until the age of weaning in the enclosure set up to simulate the natural habitat. The period of occurrence was reduced by disappearance of some formation patterns observable in the laboratory open-field and the onset of caravaning exactly synchronized with that of spontaneous and independent locomotion. Development of caravaning in the outdoor enclosure closely resembled the development of Pattern V in the open-field (Experiment III). The adaptive significance of caravaning can be fully understood only by comparing behaviours which occur in different situations. Such an approach could bridge the gap between observations in the laboratory and those in the natural habitat. In Experiment I, caravaning was compared between domesticated laboratory animals and animals at the first two generations of nonsib-mating from wild ones. The age-dependent tendency was more distinct in the latter group. This suggests that mother-offspring relations changed in the process of domestication. Behaviour Vol. 99 (1986) pp. 139-156 DISTRACTION, DECISIONS AND PERSISTENCE IN RUNWAY TESTS USING THE DOMESTIC CHICK R.M. KLEIN and R.J. ANDREW School of Biological Sciences, University of Sussex, Brighton, U.K. Androgens appear to cause reduced distractibility and increased focussing of attention in a number of species of mammals and birds. It is here shown, using runway tests, that in the domestic chick the changes in attention produced by testosterone are diverse, affecting on the one hand processes following immediately after perception, and on the other the allocation of attention between different stimuli over quite long periods of time. Examples of the first type include reduced distraction at first presentations of</page><page sequence="100">742 VOLUME 99 a conspicuous but irrelevant stimulus, increased response to change in the stimulus on which attention is focussed, and increased likelihood of fast response when a stimulus of the type which is being sought, appears in an unexpected position. All can be explained as due to an increased ability to specify stably a particular stimulus or type of stimulus as that which is being sought or on which attention is to be sustained. Longer term changes in the organisation of behaviour suggest that more than one focus of attention can be stably specified in a particular period of time. Testosterone-treated chicks will alternate attention between two very different stimuli (food and a conspicuous novel stimulus), even when one cannot be seen from the other without locomotion. It is necessary to consider the full complex of linked changes which may result from modulation of attention by hormones (or other physiological variables), in any discussion of the benefits and costs which might result. Behaviour Vol.99 (1986) pp. 157-175 COMMUNICATION BY AGONISTIC DISPLAYS: II. PERCEIVED INFORMATION AND THE DEFINITION OF AGONISTIC DISPLAYS D. PATON Department of Psychology, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland, U.K. 1) Great skua (Stercorarius skua) interactions were studied in the club areas of colonies on Hoy and Fair Isle. Attention was centred on reactor response to postures given by actors which did not attack or escape after displaying. 2) The regression of the reactor's escape probability on distance from the actor was analysed for Facing and Not Facing orientations of the actor. 3) Responses shown to the postures Oblique/Long Call/Wing-raising (Facing and Not Facing), Neck Straight/Bill Straight (Not Facing) and Neck Straight/Bill Straight/Long Call (Not Facing) were similar, and depended on distance, rather than the posture. This rules out the possibility that these postures constitute distinct threat signals. However, Neck Straight/Bill Straight (and Neck Straight/Bill Straight/Long Call) Facing showed a distinct pattern of response which indicated that they formed a (single) thread signal. 4) This pattern was consistent across the different colony-year samples. 5) It was concluded that the great skua behaviour patterns analysed here acted to define different situations rather than providing information about signaller intentions. Behaviour Vol. 99 (1986) pp. 177-188 RECOGNITION OF THE SOW'S VOICE BY NEONATAL PIGLETS ELIZABETH E. SHILLITO WALSER A.F.R.C. Institute of Animal Physiology, Babraham, Cambridge, CB2 4AT, England Piglets were tested for recognition of their sow's voice at 1, 2 &amp; 6 days of age. Each piglet was tested individually by playing one minute of recorded grunts from its own sow and one minute of recordings from an alien sow, compared with a one minute period alone with no sound. The vocalizations of the piglets were recorded and analysed. Some piglets responded to their own sow's voice by making rapid 'quacking' grunts which different in tone from the 'closed mouth grunts' made alone; some piglets responded by orientation and movements towards the sound. At one day old 29% piglets responded vocally exclusively to their own sow and 52% responded when movement was included as a sign of recognition. 27% piglets responded to both own and alien sow voices. At 2 days the response had become exclusive to their own sow's voice and 87% piglets responded (57% vocally). At 6 days 81% piglets responded positively to their own sow's voice (62% vocally). The number of grunts increased in each minute of the tests with 1 and 2 day old piglets regardless of treatment, but at 6 days old, the piglets grunted more to their own sow's voice than to an alien.</page><page sequence="101">VOLUME 99 743 Behaviour Vol. 99 (1986) pp. 189-220 TEMPORAL ORGANISATION IN THE BEHAVIOUR OF NEWBORN INFANTS IN ACTIVE SLEEP VALDIMAR BRIEM Department of Psychology, Lund University, 223 50 Lund, Sweden The human neonate normally spends nearly 2/3 of its time asleep, and this time ca 2/3 are spent in active sleep (AS). The present study was designed to investigate the temporal organisation and behavioural composition of this state. The hypothesis was put forward that the amount of facial behaviour that could be observed at any point in time during AS was representative of the neonate's general state of activation, and that the degree of activation varied with cyclic regularity. To test this, the facial behaviour of 8 normal neonates was filmed, and the films observed repeatedly. All activity occurring in three facial regions was registered and the resultant behavioural sequences analysed. It was found that facial behaviour tended to occur in bursts, and the median activity-quiescence cycle length was about 9 seconds. The amount of facial behaviour tended to wax and wane in a compound rhythm, and the lengths of the activity cycles involved could be predicted from a geometric function model. The results were compared with the evidence for cyclic behavioural activity found by previous investigators, and several explanatory models were examined. It is proposed that the activity cycles observed here are related to the rhythmicity observed in other behavioural states of the human infant. Behaviour Vol. 99 (1986) pp. 221-249 AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF WEANING IN THE DOMESTIC CAT PAUL MARTIN University of Cambridge, Sub-Department of Animal Behaviour, Madingley, Cambridge CB3 8AA, U.K. The first part of the paper describes the process of weaning in domestic cats. The subjects were seven families of cats living under laboratory conditions-each family consisting of a mother and her two kittens, living in their own large indoor pen. Observations were carried out at regular intervals from the third week after birth until the kittens were 10 weeks old. Weaning is viewed as the period during which the rate of milk transfer from mother to offspring drops most sharply. According to this definition, weaning commenced when the kittens were four weeks old and was largely completed by the time they were seven weeks old. During the weaning period mothers made suckling progressively more difficult for their kittens by in- creasingly adopting body postures that blocked access to their nipples. The amount of suckling declined sharply from four weeks after birth and seldom occurred after seven weeks. Kittens were first seen to eat solid food during the fifth week, and this was associated with a large increase in the variability of their daily weight gain. Prior to the start of weaning, mothers' food intake was approximately double that of non-lactating females. Male kittens grew more rapidly than their sisters and were significantly heavier. However, there was no evidence that males suckled more than females prior to the start of weaning. In general, weaning was characterised by a gradual reduction in the ease with which kittens could suckle, rather than by any overt rejection or aggression by the mother. The absence of any obvious weaning conflict it thought to be related to the favourable housing conditions (small litter size, ad libitum food, freedom from disturbances, etc.) used in this study. The second half of the paper describes the results of an experiment in which maternal lactation was interrupted during the first week of weaning. Seven Experimental (E) mothers were injected with the lactation-blocking drug bromocriptine on days 28, 30 and 33 post partum, each injection being sufficient to interrupt lactation for about 18-24 h. In the period immediately following the injections (days 29-46), E mothers and their kittens were more active than the controls, and E mothers washed their kittens more. Later on (days 47-70), E kittens suckled more than the controls-notably in the eighth week after birth, at a time when suckling would normally be rare. E mothers appeared to be more willing to let their kittens suckle during this period, as they adopted a fully accessible posture more often, and a blocking posture less often, than controls. The overall pattern of results is interpreted in terms of an initial withdrawal from the kittens in the period immediately after lactation was interrupted, followed by a later resumption of maternal care and a postponement of the end of weaning. Perhaps as a result of this continuation of suckling, the experimental treatment had no overall effect on the kittens' growth, although the Experimental kittens did grow more slowly in the week of the injections. One tentative hypothesis is that the apparent postponement of weaning represents a compensatory response to the earlier reduction in the rate of parental investment.</page><page sequence="102">744 VOLUME 99 Behaviour Vol. 99 (1986) pp. 250-274 PERCEPTION OF DISTRESS CALLS IN MALLARD DUCKLINGS (ANAS PLATYRHYNCHOS) STEPHEN J. GAIONI and CHRISTOPHER S. EVANS Psychology Department, Washington University, St. Louis, MO 63130, U.S.A. Three experiments examined mallard ducklings' perception of conspecific distress calls, as measured by their tendency to alternate their own vocalizations with tape-recorded test calls. This alternation response involved a duckling inhibiting its own calls during the tape-recorded stimuli, and then calling during the interstimulus intervals. 1. In Experiments 1 and 2, when ducklings were tested with calls having note periods that were substan- tially shorter or longer than the normal note period for distress calls, they showed a significant decrement in their call alternation response. The effects of shortening and lengthening note period, however, were not symmetrical: shortening note period by a given amount had a greater effect on responding than length- ening note period by that same amount. This response asymmetry may be due to a selection pressure operating to enable ducklings to discriminate between distress calls and another conspecific vocalization, contentment calls, which have shorter note periods than distress calls. 2. Experiment 3 examined the effect on ducklings of simultaneously manipulating two acoustic features known to be important for duckling recognition of distress calls: the temporal patterning of the notes within the call, and the frequency sweep found at the end of each distress note. Ducklings tested with a call having both a shortened note period, and the terminal frequency sweep removed from each note, displayed a significantly worse alternation response than ducklings tested with calls having either shortened note periods, or deleted frequency sweeps, but not both. The ducklings in the latter two treatments, in turn, had a significantly worse alternation response than ducklings tested with a normal call. Thus, the effects of manipulating these two acoustic features summated. 3. These results are consistent with a model of auditory perception in mallard ducklings in which recog- nition of a species-typical call depends on the summation of outputs from a set perceptual filters each tuned to a specific acoustic feature of the call. Experiments are currently in progress to examine whether this model can be applied to mallard duckling perception of a second species-typical vocalization, the duckling contentment call. Behaviour Vol. 99 (1986) pp. 275-295 DEVELOPMENT OF PREDATORY BEHAVIOUR IN THE SOUTHERN GRASSHOPPER MOUSE (ONYCHOMYS TORRIDUS) WILLIAM M. LANGLEY Zoology Department, Arizona State University This study described the effects that maturation and experience had on the development of cricket-catching behaviour in the southern grasshopper mouse. The responses of eight groups of mice of different ages or backgrounds were compared. Mice from the field exhibited the most proficient searches, pursuits, and kills and committed fewer errors than the lab-reared mice. Of the groups of lab-reared mice, the 20-day-old mice were the least and the 70-day-old the most proficient attackers. Maturation primarily affected the mouse's first attack response. Mice younger than 23 days of age were more reluctant to attack a cricket the first time than older lab-reared mice. These maturational changes appeared related to when weaning normally occurs in grasshopper mice. Experience contributed to the development of attack proficiency in three ways: decrease in reluctance to attack, improved killing technique and recognition of a cricket as prey sooner during an encounter. Compared with hamsters, grasshopper mice exhibit a nearly complete functional attack response the first time and require much less experience from repeated trials to become proficient insect captors. The early and rapid development of a proficient attack response may be related to the grasshopper mouse's carnivorous life style.</page><page sequence="103">VOLUME 99 745 Behaviour Vol. 99 (1986) pp. 296-315 THE HIDDEN COSTS OF SOCIALITY: INTRA-GROUP VARIATION IN FEEDING STRATEGIES IN SUMATRAN LONG-TAILED MACAQUES (MA CA CA FASCICULARIS) CAREL P. van SCHAIK and MARIA A. van NOORDWIJK Laboratory of Comparative Physiology, University of Ultrecht, Jan van Galenstraat 40, 3572 LA Utrecht, The Netherlands Groups of long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) are often fissioned into a large main party and one or more small parties. We studied the size and composition of the main party in relation to fruit supply and the ecology of the various age-sex categories in order to establish the cause of this fissioning. The size of the main party varied not only because the size of available fruit trees varied but also because the various age-sex categories were so different in their feeding strategies that they sometimes went separate ways. Our observations suggest that body size and sex profoundly affected food requirements and the risk attached to leaving the main party. We concluded that adult females left the main party mainly to escape from feeding competition and attempted to reduce travel time when they had infants so as to minimise the costs of carrying infants. Males, by contrast, left above all because of their different food requirements; subadult males left to eat more fruit than the others, adult males mainly to eat bigger fruit than the others. This intra-group variation in feeding strategies constitutes a usually hidden cost to sociality.</page><page sequence="104">746 VOLUME 100 Behaviour Vol. 100 (1987) pp. 1-32 RATES OF ATTACK AND CONTROL OF THE OFFSPRING SEX RATIO IN THE PARASITIC WASP LARIOPHAGUS DISTINGUENDUS IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE HOST QUALITY VARIES G. SIMBOLOTTI, F.A. PUTTERS and J. VAN DEN ASSEM Zoological Laboratory, Division Ethology, University of Leiden, P.O. Box 9516, 2300 RA Leiden, The Netherlands Lariophagus distinguendus (Hymenoptera, Pteromalidae) is a solitary (one egg per host) parasite of the larvae of many weevils; the common granary weevil (Sitophilus granarius) was used as host in our experiments. Policy rules for female wasps on how to respond to different host sizes under different conditions of host density, in order to maximize reproductive success, are defined by a number of optimality models. We carried out experiments 1) to test predictions derived from such models and 2) to investigate the nature of the proximate causal factors in control of parasitisation behaviour. Our results support several predictions: effects of different host densities on accept/reject decisions, differential use of hosts for male and female offspring, use of relative instead of absolute host measures. However, host discrimination was never absolute, and seemingly "erroneous" decisions were made more often than could be accounted for as occasional errors. Parasitisation decisions (reject, accept for a male egg, accept for a female egg) appeared to depend (at least partly) upon experience with (a) previous host(s). Therefore, the procedures seem to involve storage of information in, and retrieval from a memory; the question is how much detail is required to account for the observed performances? We propose a hypothesis for the proximate control of parasitisation decisions. On the basis of this hypothesis we developed a model which was simulated on a computer. A simple two-factor version of the model proved sufficient for generating all essential properties of parasitisation behaviour. A detailed memory store is not a necessary requirement; this factor could be reduced to a one-dimensional, scalar variable associated with the number of mature eggs available for oviposition upon an encounter with a host. Behaviour Vol. 100 (1987) pp. 33-49 AMBIVALENCE IN THE STRUCTURE OF DISPLAY VOCALIZATIONS OF GULLS AND TERNS: NEW EVIDENCE IN FAVOUR OF TINBERGEN'S CONFLICT HYPOTHESIS? JAN VEEN Zoological Laboratory, University of Groningen, P.O. Box 14, 9750 AA Haren (Gr.), The Netherlands This paper deals with the question whether and how motivational systems for attack and escape may find expression in social displays of gulls, with special reference to vocalizations. A comparison of sonagrams of the vocal display 'Long Call' of common term, arctic tern and little gull with calls made by these species during overt attack and overt escape behaviour shows that attack and escape elements can be recognized in the structure of the Long Call (Figs 2 and 5). The alternation of notes of long and short duration in the Long Call of the little gull (Fig. 3) is regarded as an example of successive ambivalence; long and short notes representing attack and escape tendencies respectively. Whether nowadays occurrence of the Long Call is still under the influence of motivational systems for attack and escape has been studied by analysing the extent to which elements of attack recognized in the Long Call of the little gull alter with presumed motivational changes. It turned out that note duration increased with increase of the incidence of overt attack in three different situations. Similar changes were observed in form elements of the Oblique Posture which typically accompanies the Long Call by birds on the ground (Fig. 6). It is argued that it seems to be the rule rather than exception that the same gull display (visual as well as vocal) occurs in different centexts in which the probability that it is followed by attack or escape varies greatly. Evidence available from studies of a great number of gull species suggests that motivational state underlying a particular display may vary considerably and that different motivational states are reflected by the extent to which motivation specific components of the display manifest themselves. Thus, it is not the display itself (as proposed by TINBERGEN, 1959 and MOYNIHAN, 1955a), but certain elements of which it is composed, which are under the control of the attack and escape motivation.</page><page sequence="105">VOLUME 100 747 BEER (1975) has experimentally shown, that feature differences within Long Calls of laughing gulls determine different reactions. In case of the little gull, feature differences communicating about motivation might well explain the different reactions to Long Calls in different circumstances. Behaviour Vol. 100 (1987) pp. 50-60 VOCAL RESPONSES OF LAMBS TO SOUND RECORDINGS OF EWE BLEATS ELIZABETH SHILLITO WALSER and DAVID EUROF WALTERS A.F.R.C. Institute of Animal Physiology, Babraham, Canbridge, CB2 4AT and A.F.R.C. Statistics Group, Department of Applied Biology, Pembroke Street, Cambridge CB2 3DX, England A series of playback experiments were carried out on Dalesbred, Jacob and Border Leicester lambs at 7, 20 and 30 days old, to investigate when the lamb's vocal answering response developed. The lambs were tested one by one in a small pen, during which time they heard a recording of their own ewe's bleats and a recording of an alien ewe. Half the lambs heard their dam first and alien ewe second, the others heard the alien ewe first and their dam second. The vocalisations of the lambs were recorded on a tape recorder and later analysed to count the number of bleats made by the lambs in response to 10 ewe bleats. The time interval between bleats was measured and when the lamb bleats overlapped ewe bleats, the time from the start of the ewe bleat was also measured. The 7 day old lambs answered more bleats from their own ewes than alien, but there was no difference between the lamb's responses to own or alien ewe at 20 and 30 days. The lambs bleated rapidly in response to the ewe bleats often bleating before the ewe bleat had ended. These were named 'continuous' bleat responses and the time to respond varied from 0.51-0.69 sec. The 'timed' bleat responses were made after the ewe bleat was complete, and the interval between bleats varied at 7 days from 0.83 sec for Jacobs to 1.41 sec for Dalesbreds and 1.35 sec for Border Leicester lambs. The length of the response interval increased with age. The lambs made fewer 'continuous' bleat responses at 20 and 30 days than at 7 days. The failure to get any consistent difference in lamb vocal responses to own or alien ewe bleats was probably caused by putting the lambs into small pents, as previous results with free running lambs have shown that the lambs answer more to their own ewe.

Two hand-reared groups of Barnacle goslings were studied with regard to vocal development, starting from 20 h before hatching up to 200 days of age. The vocal repertoire of goslings is made up of 4 call types differing structurally as well as contextually. They are, however, connected with each other by mixed and transition forms, and hence can principally be regarded as a modified graded call system. While main call pitch ascends during the first few days of late embryonic and juvenile development, this is followed by a gradual and continuous pitch descent over approximately 70 days. Breaking of the voice is a heterogenous and gradual process of maturation reaching a preliminary degree of perfection at about 40 days of age. As compared with phonetic development, syntactic parameters appear to be kept widely constant through- out development including call type, individual, and sexual characteristics. Comparison between two independently reared gosling.groups indicates a social influence on early development. Developmental changes found in juvenile Barnacle geese include linear processes such as descent of pitch and break- ing of the voice, intra-individual and sexual differentiation, formalization by reduction of variability and apparent motivational changes.</page><page sequence="106">748 VOLUME 100 Behaviour Vol. 100 (1987) pp. 92-104 BEHAVIOURAL ASPECTS OF SPERM COMPETITION IN SWALLOWS (HIR UNDO RUSTICA) ANDERS PAPE M0LLER Institute of Zoology and Zoophysiology, Zoological Laboratory, University of Aarhus, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark I studied sperm competition in a swallow Hirundo rustica population using copulations and copulation attempts as measures of male interests and successful copulations as measures of female interests. Cop- ulation success was similar in the pre-fertile and the fertile period for both mates and non-mates. Daily patterns of copulation were also similar in the prefertile and the fertile period. Males could thus not tell from copulation success whether the female was in the fertile period. A higher proportion of ECPs oc- curred during female's fertile periods, than did pair copulations, but the actual number of pair copulations was greater. Non-mate males fathered a large fraction (ca 25%) of offspring according to parent-offspring regressions of tarsus length. The daily pattern showed early pair copulations and later extra-pair cop- ulations. Male swallows increased their copulation rate in response to chases of their female mates by neighbouring males. Male swallows allocated their ejaculates at an optimal time of the season (primarily non-mate males copulated within the fertile period) and the day, and male mates prevented cuckoldry threats by increasing copulation rates if their female mates were chased by neighbour males. Behaviour Vol. 100 (1987) pp. 105-122 INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN BEHAVIOURAL REACTION TO A CHANGING ENVIRONMENT IN MICE AND RATS R.F. BENUS, J.M. KOOLHAAS and G.A. VAN OORTMERSSEN Department of Animal Physiology, University of Groningen, P.O. Box 14, 9750 AA Haren, The Netherlands Aggressive and non-aggressive male mice differ in their reaction to a changing social environment. In order to investigate if this differentiation holds also for non-social situations male mice are trained in a standard maze task, whereafter a change (extramaze and intramaze, respectively) is introduced. The results indicate that aggressive males fulfil their task fairly routine-like and do not react to a change which is in contrast to the non-aggressive individuals. In a second experiment a more continuously changing situation is created by testing the animals every 3 trials in a different maze configuration. In this situation in which a routine cannot be developed c.q. used, the aggressive males performed worse than the non-aggressive animals. It is suggested that the behaviour of aggressive males is mainly controlled by intrinsic factors whereas the behaviour of non-aggressive males is more dependent on external factors. Similar results are obtained when repeating the experiments with rats. This indicates that the relation between aggression and behavioural reaction to a changing environment has more general validity. The possibly underlying mechanism is discussed as well as the consequences for the functioning of the animals in a social setting. Behaviour Vol. 100 (1987) pp. 123-133 RESPECTIVE PARTS OF THE CARRIER AND OF THE FREQUENCY MODULATION IN THE SEMANTICS OF DISTRESS CALLS AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY ON STURNUS VULGARIS BY MEAN OF DIGITAL SYNTHESIS METHODS THIERRY AUBIN Laboratoire d'Ethologie Experimentale, Station de Terrain de St. Lucien, 28210 Nogent-le-Roi, France Distress calls are complex signals, i.e. they are made up of numerous harmonics. Their spectral com- position suggests that there are two components: a carrier frequency and a modulating frequency. We have distinguished a primary modulation (slow increase or decrease of frequencies from the beginning to the end of the call) and an additional secondary modulation (fast frequency sweeps within a narrow bandwidth).</page><page sequence="107">VOLUME 100 749 We have attempted to examine the role of these different signal components in the semantics of distress. The resolve this problem, we have used digital synthesis methods. We have performed playback exper- iments in the field with starlings (Sturnus vulgaris). These experiments give the following results: a carrier frequency presented alone, without frequency modulation, does not elicit distress reactions. A sig- nal with the carrier frequency only, modulated by a secondary modulation, gives the same results. But obvious distress reactions are observed if the carrier frequency is modulated by a signal which presents a slight increasing slope (primary modulation), be it with or without a secondary modulation. The primary modulation appears to be a very important parameter in the decoding of starlings distress calls. On the other hand, secondary modulation appears to be unnecessary for this decoding. We have demonstrated that distress calls, in spite of their complex structure, follow a very simple law of decoding. Behaviour Vol. 100 (1987) pp. 134-169 ON THE MECHANISM OF MATE SELECTION IN BLACK-HEADED GULLS JOHAN VAN RHIJN and TON GROOTHUIS Dept. of Zoology, University of Groningen, P.O. Box 14, 9750 AA Haren, The Netherlands Processes leading to the establishment of social relationship are the main topic of the present study, which is based on observations of black-headed gulls kept in experimental groups in aviaries. Among these birds various kinds of social relationships were established, such as heterosexual monogamous pair-bonds, polygynous associations, and male-male relationships. Some of the factors which give rise to the formation of such relationships could be studied, because it was possible to watch all individuals during their whole life, and during all stages of their reproductive cycle. Quantitative data were collected on the influence of sex, age, reproductive state, physical condition, and various social factors on the incidence of social relationships. On the basis of these data it could be concluded that males and females play strongly differing roles. Onmated males advertize randomly. Unmated females direct their courtship to particular individuals, belonging to the category of advertizing unmated males, or of the active mated males. The final decision for pair-formation involves an acceptance by the approached male. Unsuccessful unmated males may adopt the female strategy, and thus establish homosexual social relationships. Mated males do not initiate courtship towards other females, but they may be courted by them. Mated females sometimes display social interest for other males. The main criteria for mate choice were advanced age, early nuptial moult, small body-size, and, in particular, social experience with one another. In contrast to our expectation, body weight and matching of nuptial moult and physical condition between partners were not important in our birds. The significance of the criteria age and moult may be directly related to fitness. The preference for small males had earlier (VAN RHIJN, 1985) been interpreted as a mechanism preventing polygyny, but additional data provide some inconsistencies with that idea. Finally, the significance of social experience with each other has been related with considerable investments of prospective mates before establishing a pair-bond, and with an increase of synchronization between mates as a result of long-lasting pair-bonds. Female-female pairing among some wild larids has been interpreted as a continuation of early bonds between nest companions. Behaviour Vol. 100 (1987) pp. 170-201 EXTRAPAIR COPULATIONS IN THE MATING SYSTEM OF WHITE IBIS (EUDOCIMUS ALBUS) PETER C. FREDERICK Dept. of Biology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, N.C. 27514, U.S.A. Mating behavior of white ibis was intensively observed in a large breeding colony in coastal South Carolina, U.S.A. Extrapair copulations (EPCs) were found to be a frequent and regular feature of the mating system. EPCs appeared to be fully capable of fertilizing egges, on the basis of their form, timing, and male and female behavior in response to them. Females appeared to cooperate fully in some EPCs; this cooperation included cloacal flaring, and sperm was clearly transferred during some EPCs. Females were able to reject EPCs, and EPCs were not forced by males. Based on the relative frequency of apparently successful extrapair and withinpair copulations, EPCs were estimated to fertilize 6.05% of all eggs. EPC involvement among males was based on abilities to remain on the colony, to displace other males, and to take only short foraging trips. Female EPC involvement was based on the amount of time they were left unguarded. A male's EPC involvement was inversely correlated with that of his mate. Extrapair males were of distinctly different quality than the female's nestmate. Among study groups, EPC rate was</page><page sequence="108">750 VOLUME 100 not correlated with degree of local nesting density, sex ratio, clutch size. Female cooperation and the efficiency of male mate guarding were concluded to be important to the evolution of this mating strategy in white ibis. It is concluded that EPC is an important strategy in this otherwise monogamous species. The exact costs and benefits of this strategy to both sexes are discussed. Behaviour Vol. 100 (1987) pp. 202-225 REPRODUCTIVE BEHAVIOUR OF THE DECORATED CRICKET, GRYLLODES SUPPLICANS (ORTHOPTERA: GRYLLIDAE): CALLING SCHEDULES, SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION, AND MATING SCOTT K. SAKALUK Department of Zoology, Erindale College, University of Toronto, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada L5L 1C6 The temporal and spatial patterns of sexual activity in the cricket, Gryllodes supplicans, were examined. Calling by males in a natural population occurred throughout the night, reflecting the temporal availability of females. In an outdoor enclosure, females were significantly more likely than males to change locations from one hr to the next; the average probability of such a change by a female was 0.6, and this did not vary significantly over the course of a night. The locomotor activity of females, as indicated by the average distance an individual moved each hour (and between nights), also was significantly greater than that of males. The greater mobility of females increased their access to additional males, and probably allowed them to consume more spermatophores (sperm-containing vessels transferred by males which remain outside females' bodies after mating) than they would otherwise obtain by remaining with the same mate. An increased demand by females for additional spermatophores was evidenced in the laboratory by repeated mating, frequent consumption of spermatophores, brief intercopulatory intervals, and the theft of sper- matophores from mated females. Spermatophore theft demonstrates that females solicit spermatophores for benefits other than genes (i.e. nutrition), and has not previously been reported for any insect. In contrast to females, males exhibited increased site fidelity and reduced locomotor activity in the enclo- sure. By calling only when hidden and stationary, males probably reduce the possibility of detection by acoustically orienting predators. Males also occurred beneath shelters with other calling males, but did not themselves call or did so at reduced levels. These males probably were 'satellites', silent males that locate next to calling males and intercept the phonotactically responding females.

The utterance of one or more Long Calls appears to serve the advertisement of the identity of a bird. It enables the mates to recognize one another before landing takes place and thus facilitates its procedure. It always precedes the greeting ceremony and reduces aggressiveness in the incubating bird. The Bow and Moan Call expresses a certain degree of aggressiveness in the arriving bird; it usually precedes aggressive interactions initiated by the newcomer. It is often followed by the departure of the resident from the nest already before the other bird lands. Silent landings mainly occur in birds which are in a flight situation. When during a silent landing a bird is sitting on the nest, it often seems surprised and reacts aggressively. Silent landings also occur during nestbuilding and may then be a consequence of that particular kind of activity. The landing calls are adapted to the establishment of acoustic communication between conspecifics in the cliff-nesting situation of this species, especially to the tiny landing surface. They are an important component of the sound level in the colony and, at least partly responsible for the noisiness of this species. This interpretation is supported by a comparison of the breeding biology, landing behaviour and sound level of eight other colony breeding species.</page><page sequence="109">VOLUME 100 751 Since the colony's social context have many important consequences on the psychophysiology of repro- duction of birds, it is stated that these acoustic communications in relation with the particular biology of this species must have influenced greatly its demography. Behaviour Vol. 100 (1987) pp. 247-291 GROUP FUSION AMONG WILD TOQUE MACAQUES: AN EXTREME CASE OF INTER-GROUP RESOURCE COMPETITION WOLFGANG P.J. DITTUS Office of Zoological Research, National Zoological Park, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C. 20008, U.S.A. and Institute of Fundamental Studies, Sri Lanka 1. Two independent groups of toque macaques (Macaca sinica) fused into one larger cohesive group. The groups were part of a population of 18 to 22 groups that inhabit natural forest at Polonnaruwa, Sri Lanka, and that had been observed more or less continuously from 1968 to 1985. 2. The group fusion generally supports WRANGHAM'S (1980) model of the evolution of group living and female residence patterns in "female-bonded" primate groups. 3. The effect of the group fusion was that of a take-over by the dominant group (Group A) of the subordinate group's (Group SG) home range. It was the extension of a competitive relationship between the two groups over at least seven years before the fusion whereby they contested concentrated food resources, such as fruiting trees, more frequently with each other than with any one of their other respective neighboring groups. The relationship was highly asymmetrical as the dominant Group A always supplanted the subordinate one (Group SG). 4. The group fusion was preceded by a change in ranging behaviors whereby: (a) Group A itself avoided the encroachment of a dominant group in the northern regions of its home range by shifting its northern boundary southward; (b) Group A intensified its use of the southern parts of its range which overlapped with that of Group SG; and (c) Group SG used its area of overlap with Group A less intensely and shifted its range away from Group A and into previously unused areas. 5. The take-over occurred at a point in time in the history of these two groups when the defensive abilities of the subordinate group (SG) were at their weakest. This weakness was brought about by the death of two of the three matriarchs in the group shortly before the take-over. Other factors contributing to the merger were: (a) the emigration of all of the subordinate Group SG's males to the neighboring dominant Group A; (b) an ineffective defense by the new males of Group SG against the incursions of a new coalition of males from Group A that involved the previous ousted alpha male of Group SG; (c) the emigration of a juvenile female of Group SG to follow her ousted father to Group A; and (d) the friendly and protective behaviors of the alpha female of Group A towards the cowed females of Group SG during and after the take-over. 6. Aggression was most frequent at the onset of the take-over and was directed at the Group SG females primarily by the younger and subordinate females of Group A whose dominance ranks and future repro- ductive successes were threatened the most by the addition of new females to the group. Normally such aggression would serve as a barrier to group fusion. 7. In the merged group behaviors were differentiated most strongly according to familiarity or group of origin (kinship). This was evident from measures of (a) spatial affiliation, (b) affiliative behaviors such as grooming, and (c) agonistic support as was reflected by the proximity of ranks in the dominance hierarchy. Also, the probable father of the subjugated females defended them against the aggression of the dominant group's females. 8. The alpha female of the dominant Group A initiated more grooming, hugging and defense of the Group SG females than any other natal member of Group A. Consequently, the subjugated females spatially associated with her more than with any other natal animal of Group A. Shortly after the take-over much of her affiliative behavior had been directed towards the subjugated group's adult female, who had been carrying an infant. During these encounters the alpha female often fondled this infant and restrained it from nursing; but, her contribution to its death one month after the take-over is unknown. 9. The effect of the affiliative and protective behaviors of the alpha female of the dominant Group A towards the subjugated females of Group SG was to reduce the level of aggression between the females of these two groups. In this way her behavior facilitated the group take-over and promoted a peaceful coexistence in what was essentially a competitive relationship. 10. The integration of the subjugated females into the merged group within three months after the take- over was marked by: (a) a decrease in aggression from the females of the dominant Group A to a level not significantly different from that among the subjugated females themselves; and (b) an increase in spatial affiliation and grooming between the females of the merged groups. Nevertheless, even three years after</page><page sequence="110">752 VOLUME 100 the merger, the subjugated females often split away from the rest of the group and foraged independently in an apparent attempt to avoid resource competition with the dominant natal animals of Group A. 1. Both groups benefited from an increase in home range size as a result of the merger, and this increase was greater for the subordinate group than for the dominant one. But, whereas the dominant group gained priority of access to all resources in the enlarged home range, the subjugated group did not. Instead, the females of the subjugated group occupied the lowest ranks in the dominance hierarchy of the merged group and thereby lost priority of access to recourses in the formerly exclusive areas of their range. The overall cost/benefit of the take-over therefore was greater for the subordinate group whose home range was taken over. 12. As a result of this socio-economic asymmetry the survivorship and reproductive success among the natal members of the dominant group were greater than among the members of the subordinate group all of whom (except one offspring that was born after the merger) died within eight years after the merger. The dominant group grew at the expense of the subordinate one (DITTUS, 1986). 13. This degree of behavioral and demographic asymmetry among the subjugated females was not observed among their male relatives who had immigrated into the dominant group before the take-over. 14. The take-over did not alter the relative sizes of the merged group with those neighboring groups that had dominated either Group A or SG before the merger. Therefore, the dominance relations among these groups also remained unchanged. 15. The chance of any one group taking over another's home range and merging with it in any one year is very low (P &amp;lt; .004). It would most likely involve a small group with limited defenses against a larger one and under conditions where intergroup competition for shared resources is accentuated. Behaviour Vol. 100 (1987) pp. 292-302 ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL INFLUENCES ON AUTOGROOMING BEHAVIOUR IN A CAPTIVE GROUP OF JAVA MONKEYS ALFONSO TROISI Cattedra di Clinica Psichiatrica, II Universita di Roma, Viale di Villa Massimo 47, 00161 Rome, Italy GABRIELE SCHINO Cattedra di Ecologia ed Etologia Animale, Dipartimento di Genetica e Biologia Molecolare, Universita La Sapienza, 00185 Rome, Italy This study was aimed at evaluating the influence of environmental and social factors on autogrooming behaviour of captive Java monkeys. The subjects were one male and five female adult monkeys housed in an outdoor cage measuring 3.3 x 2.2 x 3.3(H) m. Data on autogrooming were collected during one-hour observation sessions by combining focal behaviour and complete record sampling techniques. A total of 150 hr of observation were made with each daylight hour between 0800 hours and 1600 hours sampled 16 to 20 times. 1) Autogrooming by each of the study subjects showed marked variations throughout the day. The major amount of autogrooming was recorded between 0800 hours and 1100 hours with a second minor peak occurring between 1200 hours and 1400 hours. The lowest mean levels were recorded in the late morning and in the late afternoon. 2) Although there was evidence that the influence of climatic factors was less than that exerted by the time of day, the results indicated that temperature and/or relative humidity were instrumental in influencing the amount of autogrooming that the monkeys performed. More autogrooming was done under conditions of high temperature and low relative humidity. 3) Interindividual proximity was shown to influence autogrooming. Female autogrooming proved to be positively correlated with proximity (within 1 m) to the male. By contrast, there was no significant correlation between autogrooming by the females and their contact score with the male. We interpreted these results as evidence that a relevant portion of the autogrooming recorded in the study group was done as a displacement activity and/ or as a redirected activity. Our interpretation is based on the assumption that, for the females, being close to the male can result in a conflict situation whereas being in contact with him is a goal situation which thus corresponds, by definition, to the absence of conflict.</page><page sequence="111">VOLUME 100 753 Behaviour Vol. 100 (1987) pp. 303-320 THE EFFECTS OF SEX, TEMPERATURE AND COMPANIONS ON LOOKING-UP AND FEEDING IN SINGLE AND MIXED SPECIES FLOCKS OF HOUSE SPARROWS (PASSER DOMESTICUS), CHAFFINCHES (FRINGILLA COELEBS), AND STARLINGS (STURNUS VULGARIS) FIONA M. BEVERIDGE and JOHN M. DEAG Department of Zoology, University of Edinburgh, West Mains Road, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, U.K. 1. Measurements were made during the winter of peck rate, look-up rate, proportion of time in look-up and mean duration of the look-ups in small flocks. 2. Sex differences in look-up rate and proportion of time in look-up were found in house sparrows and chaffinches, the females looking-up more than males. 3. In male house sparrows the number of house sparrow companions has a marked effect on the measures of looking-up and peck rate. Female and male companions influence the subject's behaviour in different ways. In female subjects these effects are absent or very weak. Chaffinches of both sexes modify their behaviour in response to the number of chaffinch companions. For female subjects, increasing the number of female, but not male, companions has a marked influence on peck rate and proportion of time in look-up. Starlings modify their behaviour in response to the number of starling companions. 4. Interspecific effects on behaviour were found. Female house sparrows are responsive to the number of male chaffinch companions, chaffinches of both sexes respond to the number of house sparrows, and starlings respond to the number of chaffinches. 5. The changes in behaviour with increasing number of flock companions (both conspecific and hete- rospecific), support the flock vigilance hypothesis which states that birds can exploit the vigilance of their companions and can therefore reduce their own vigilance. Many of our results indicate, however, that in some circumstances this is an inadequate explanation of the behaviour seen and several other factors are discussed, particularly the role of flock members looking at each other. These factors may reinforce or contradict trends associated with the flock vigilance hypothesis, in ways that may depend on the sex of the subject and its companions. 6. Temperature and date both influence looking-up and the peck rate. In studies of this type it is clearly important to control for these and for the sex of the subject and its flock companions.</page><page sequence="112">754 VOLUME 101 Behaviour Vol. 101 (1987) pp. 1-86 GROWING INDEPENDENCE, CONFLICT AND LEARNING IN MOTHER-INFANT RELATIONS IN FREE-RANGING CHIMPANZEES HEDWIG H.C. van de RIJT-PLOOIJ Department of Physical Anthropology, University of Cambridge, England FRANS X. PLOOIJ Department of Development Psychology, University of Nijmegen, The Netherlands Several investigators discussed the need to know more about conditions which facilitate normal human development, especially the need for a better understanding of the processes at work during the develop- ment towards greater independence in normal and pathogenic human relationships. The study reported in this paper aims to provide a description of the processes at work during the development of contact- and distance regulation for free-living chimpanzee mother-infant relationships. We believe that such an etho- logical study contributes to human studies by providing methods of observing and analysing behaviour, and by providing hypotheses that can be tested. Our study takes a systems approach to mother-infant contact- and distance regulation. We looked at the history of mother-infant relationship in terms of the effects of changes in the mother's and infant's behaviour on the mother-infant dyad as a self-regulating homeostatic system. A single-subject research design was used, because it has special advantages for the study of development processes, not shared by the usual experimental- or correlational designs. We found that the infants' progress towards greater independence proceeds discontinuously in 5 jumps over the first 24 months. With each jump the following drastic changes are found in the quality of the distance-regulation between mother and infant and/or the amount of time spent at a certain distance: 1. After month 2 maternal behaviour related to carrying and supporting the babies in the ventro-ventral position decreased sharply and the babies were forced to cling to the mother themselves. 2. In month 5-6 a period of mother-infant conflict was found in which aggressive maternal rebuffs were aimed at breaking nipple- and ventro-ventral contact. Before this age the mothers were primarily responsible for ventro-ventral contact, and after this age the infants were. A relation was found between the rebuffs and the onset of dorsal riding and eating solid food. These changes in the mother-infant interaction coincided with physical changes such as a change in the speed of growth and the eruption of teeth. The findings are placed in the wider framework of mammalian development. 3. After month 7 an explosion of the frequency of the infants' excursions was found and the infants now made short lasting excursions and remain within arm's reach from their mothers. It is argued that such excursion behavior expresses the infants' concern with the distance to their mothers at this age. 4. Around month 12 and month 18 periods of mother-infant conflict were found in which the aggressive maternal rebuffs were aimed at breaking body contact. Both periods of mother-infant conflict were associated with peaks in the infants' responsibility for body contact and with rises in the amount of time spent in this contact. Both periods of mother-infant conflict were followed by sharp drops in the amount of time spent in body contact, and after each drop time spent in body contact remained at a newly reached level. Furthermore, after both periods of mother-infant conflict all infants made use of space more distant from their mothers. We found that mothers do not promote the infants' independence as a whole in each conflict period, but that they do so only for a particular aspect in training the infants how to adapt to other individuals and to the physical outer world when using the new ability. It is argued that mothers recognize the ages that their infants are ready to reorganize their behaviour, upon which they force them to do so. The periods of mother-infant conflict around month 12 and 18 are preceded by periods of regression: temporary shifts back to mainly staying in closer contact (=qualitative regressive shifts) and temporary increases in the amount of time spent in ventro-ventral contact (= quantitative regressive peaks). It is suggested that regressive behaviour is a common feature of normal development after a certain age. We called a period in which the succession of regression and/or conflict and/or jump towards greater independence was found a labile period, as opposed to stabile periods. In the general discussion the following topics are attended to: a) The possibility that "labile periods at specific ages" in the mother-infant relationship are a common feature in normal development. b) The possibility that changes in maternal behaviour in each labile period are responsible for the phe- nomenon of jumps in the growing independence, provided that the infants are not pushed beyond their maturational abilities.</page><page sequence="113">VOLUME 101 755 c) The possibility that regression, which precedes mother-infant conflict, is associated with maturational changes in the infant is discussed. Several authors associated regressive behaviour with spurts in devel- opment. d) The possibility that maturational changes are associated with development steps. Infants contribute to changes in the mother-infant systems as they change maturationally. The latter changes were established independently of their effect on the mother-infant relationship by PLOOIJ (1984). He looked for qualitative changes over development in behaviour and recognized 5 steps in the infant's first year of life. It is discussed that the onsets of labile periods in the mother-infant relationship are associated with the developmental steps. It seems that a development step triggers mother-infant conflict, and that mother's behaviour during this conflict is of vital importance in realizing the infant's developmental potential. PETERFREUND'S (1971) thinking on the relation between maturation and learning (reprogramming) suggests mother's helpful contributions to what happens around the times of occurrence of development steps. We related our findings to BOWLBY'S (1969, 1973, 1980) attachment theory. The possibility is discussed that attachment takes different forms over age, depending on the proximity involved and the skills available to the infant, and that it is active and present from birth onwards.

UNWIN University of Cambridge, Department of Zoology, Downing Street, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, U.K. PAUL MARTIN University of Cambridge, Sub-Department of Animal Behaviour, Madingley, Cambridge CB3 8AA, U.K. The paper describes a microcomputer-based event recorder for recording behavioural observations. The system uses a widely available portable microcomputer (an Epson PX-8) and can be used for recording behaviour in a wide variety of situations. It combines the advantages of a keyboard event recorder with the ease of use and flexibility of paper-and-pencil methods (check sheets), and overcomes many of the problems inherent in specialised event recorders. With the event recorder program, the microcomputer can be used to record the frequencies, durations and latencies of many different categories of behaviour. With the check sheet emulator program, it can be used to obtain a time-sampled record of complex social behaviour, in the same way as with a check sheet. Listings of both programs, which are written in BASIC, are given. No computer programming expertise is required and no specialised hardware need be built in order to use this powerful, flexible and relatively inexpensive system. Behaviour Vol. 101 (1987) pp. 101-138 COPULATION BEHAVIOUR OF BIRDS T.R. BIRKHEAD and L. ATKIN Department of Zoology, The University, Sheffield, S1O 2TN, England A.P. M0LLER Institute of Zoology and Zoophysiology, Zoological Laboratory, University of Aarhus, DK-8000, Aarhus C, Denmark Inter-specific variation in copulation behaviour among birds is described. The following factors explaining variation in copulation rate are examined: (i) the number of eggs which have to be fertilized (the fertil- ization hypothesis), (ii) the importance of the pair-bond (the social bond hypothesis), (iii) predation risk during copulation (the predation hypothesis), and (iv) cuckoldry risk (the sperm competition hypothesis). These hypotheses were investigated in preliminary analyses at the generic level using data on copulation behaviour in 131 bird species. The sperm competition hypothesis was supported by several lines of evidence: (i) frequent copulations among genera where males are not able to guard their mates (colonial birds, diurnal birds of prey, and owls), (ii) frequent copulations in polyandrous genera, (iii) copulations inside hole-nests of colonial birds but outside the hole-nests of solitarily nesting genera, and (iv) by the occurrence of forced pair copulations following extra-pair copulation in some species. The predation and social bond hypotheses were not totally dismissed, but there was no evidence that fertilization ability was limited by copulation frequency (i.e. the fertilization hypothesis).</page><page sequence="114">756 VOLUME 101 Behaviour Vol. 101 (1987) pp. 139-155 EXTRA-PAIR COPULATIONS AND MATE GUARDING IN THE POLYTERRITORIAL PIED FLYCATCHER, FICEDULA HYPOLEUCA RAUNO V. ALATALO, KARIN GOTTLANDER and ARNE LUNDBERG Department of Zoology, Uppsala University, Box 561, S-751 22 Uppsala, Sweden 1. Seven out of 24 observed copulations (= 29%) in the pied flycatcher were extra-pair copulations (EPCs). There was no significant difference between EPCs and pair copulations (PCs) with respect to timing and duration, possibly indicating that both are equally successful. Thus, proportion of copulations may reflect share of paternity. 2. Females usually do not solicit EPCs and often try to avoid them. We cannot find that females have much to gain from EPCs, while attempts to resist forced copulations may impose some costs. The fact that EPCs still are rather frequent suggests that it might be cheaper for a female to accept an EPC than to resist it. 3. Males spend much of their time mate guarding but the distance between pair members is longer for polyterritorial males than for monoterritorial males. Still, we cannot find any significant differences in risks or possibilities of EPCs between males of different mating status. However, the relaxed mate guarding by polyterritorial males suggests that these males might take higher risks, and they also suffer more territory intrusions. 4. It is most likely that male reproductive strategies are not maintained as a frequency-dependent mixed ESS with equal pay-offs for all paired males. Instead, male strategies are conditional on phenotype and breeding circumstances. Behaviour Vol. 101 (1987) pp. 156-176 TACTILE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN EWE AND LAMB AND THE ONSET OF SUCKLING MARGARET A. VINCE AFRC Institute of Animal Physiology, Babraham, Cambridge, CB2 4AT, England A series of experiments shows (1) that the effects of tactile stimulation produced by covering the face and eyes of an unsuckled Clun Forest or Soay lamb elicits a vigorous response which includes elements such as tilting up of the muzzle, lengthening of the neck, munching, mouth opening, curling back of the upper lip in the sucking position, tongue protrusion and apparent reaching and grasping movements of the lower jaw, upper and lower lips and the tongue (2) that these movements are directional in that the neck, head, lower jaw, lips and tongue are usually turned towards the stimulus (3) that before the lamb has attained a standing posture this response appears only weakly and may be replaced by a downward head movement; also it is weakened or disappears after the lamb has sucked (4) a similar response can be elicited by a visual stimulus only more slowly and in a less vigorous form. In Soay, but not in Clun Forest, lambs the response to touch was maintained for longer when the eyes were covered, than when the lambs were able to see (5) touch on the belly of the dam, simulating that produced by a lamb pushing its muzzle up against her, causes her to arch her back upwards, while touch nearer to or no the udder, or in the inguinal area, but not on the back of the udder, is associated with lowering of the tail and an outward movement of the hind leg which exposes the teat. The findings are considered in their relation to the natural situation immediately after birth of the lamb when the interchange of different types of tactile and other sensory stimulation gradually brings both partners into a situation in which the lamb can grasp the teat and suck. Behaviour Vol. 101 (1987) pp. 177-199 THE EFFECTS OF PARENT AND OFFSPRING GENDER ON FOOD ALLOCATION IN BUDGERIGARS JUDY STAMPS, ANNE CLARK, BARBARA KUS and PAT ARROWOOD Department of Zoology, University of California, Davis, California 95616, U.S.A. Parental feeding rates in relation to the sex of parents and offspring were studied in domesticated budgeri- gars in large flight cages at Davis, California. While neither the male nor the female parent preferentially fed offspring of either sex, paternal feeding rates were strongly related to the sex ratio of the brood. Fa- thers fed female-biased broods much more frequently than male-biased broods throughout the nest cycle,</page><page sequence="115">VOLUME 101 757 and male feeding rates were highly correlated with the sex ratios of the broods. Mothers exhibited a sim- ilar but much weaker tendency to feed female-biased broods more often, and only at the end of the nest cycle was there a barely significant relationship between sex bias and maternal feeding rate. As a result of the extra parental care, female-biased broods obtained nearly three times more regurgitations in the final pre-fledge period than male-biased broods. Brood sex ratios were unrelated to fledge weights, and male and female nestlings fledged at comparable weights. However, for all but the smallest broods, there was a strong negative relationship between the percent of females within the brood and the average age of fledging. Fledge age, in turn, was related to post-fledge activity rates. Females fledging as younger ages initiated more flights than those fledging at older ages. Conversely, in males, fledge age was either unrelated, or positively related to the rate of flights. There were also significant negative relationships between female fledge age and reproductive success (e.g. number of young fledged in the first breeding season), but no significant relationships between male fledge age and reproductive success. Hence, male parents may provide extra care to broods biased toward the offspring sex which most benefits from this extra care. Behaviour Vol. 101 (1987) pp. 200-210 VOCAL COMMUNICATION IN A NEOTROPICAL TREEFROG, HYLA EBRACCATA: RESPONSES OF FEMALES TO ADVERTISEMENT AND AGGRESSIVE CALLS KENTWOOD D. WELLS and KATHLEEN M. BARD Dept. of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, U-43, The University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06268, U.S.A. We investigated the functions of different elements of the complex vocal repertoire of the Panamanian treefrog Hyla ebraccata by testing the responses of females to synthetic advertisement and aggressive calls in two-choice playback experiments. In tests of single-note advertisement calls presented at different rates, females preferred faster calling rates, regardless of the absolute rate of the stimuli. In tests of single-note advertisement and aggressive calls, females preferred advertisement calls. Addition of secondary click notes to aggressive calls made the calls more attractive to females, but multi-note advertisement calls were preferred over multi-note aggressive calls. When females were given a choice of multi-note advertisement calls and single-note calls of the same total duration, they showed no preference. This suggests that multi- note calls are preferred over normal single-note calls because of their longer total duration. When the same experiment was performed with aggressive calls, females showed a strong preference for multi-note calls. This indicates that long aggressive calls, such as those given by males in close-range encounters, may entail some cost to the male in reduced attractiveness to females. Males apparently reduce the costs of aggressive calling by adding click notes to aggressive calls, by giving aggressive calls only when nearby males do so, and by establishing spatial relationships in the chorus before females begin to choose mates. Behaviour Vol. 101 (1987) pp. 211-224 VARIATION IN MATE GUARDING INTENSITY BY MALE PURPLE MARTINS EUGENE S. MORTON Department of Zoological Research, National Zoological Park, Washington, D.C. 20008 U.S.A. The frequency with which individual male purple martins (Hirundinidae: Progne subis) guard their mates during forays to gather nest material varies from 0 to 100%. During such forays, guarding males accom- pany their mates continuously from the time a female leaves the nest site until she returns to the nest site with nest material. Non-guarding males do not accompany females on these collecting forays. Un- guarded females are subject to forced extrapair copulation attempts on almost all of their forays to collect nest material. Because this suggested that non-guarding males may have a however assurance of paternity relative to guarding males, I asked if mate guarding frequency is directly related to parental care. How- ever, male parental effort, as assessed by feeding rates, was not related to mate guarding intensity. Mate guarding intensity may vary widely among individual male martins since nest site defense may preclude guarding in some and superiority in sperm competition by means other than exclusive access to females may reduce their chances of being cuckolded.</page><page sequence="116">758 VOLUME 101 Behaviour Vol. 101 (1987) pp. 225-235 FORAGING EFFICIENCIES AND TECHNIQUES OF JUVENILE AND ADULT NORTHERN MOCKINGBIRDS (MIMUS POLYGLOTTOS) RANDALL BREITWISCH, MARILYN DIAZ and RONALD LEE Department of Biology, University of Miami, Coral Gables, Florida, 33124, U.S.A. Adult and newly independent juvenile northern mockingbirds foraged on arthropods in the breeding season at similar rates within bouts, but adult efficiency (both as captures/attempt and captures/min) was higher than juvenile efficiency. Adults also captured a greater proportion of large arthropods than juveniles, and adults preferentially fed larger prey to dependent young. Juveniles engaged in more aerial attacks as the season progressed, although their success rate in these bouts did not increase. Both adults and juveniles captured a greater proportion of large arthropods in aerial attacks than in ground attacks. Juvenile success rate in ground attacks increased with season. These observations suggest that juvenile mockingbirds change their foraging behaviour in the first 1-2 months of independence, although the mechanism involved in this change is unknown. Behaviour Vol. 101 (1987) pp. 236-242 SELECTION FOR LARVAL VAGILITY IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER LOUIS LEVINE, MARY KATZ and ROBERT F. ROCKWELL Department of Biology, City College of New York, Convent Avenue at 138th Street, New York, N.Y., 10031, U.S.A. Six lines of the Drosophila melanogaster Oregon-R stock were established and each line was selected for either sow or fast larval movement through a system that consistent of single, double or triple rings. Selection was successful in all three "slow lines" but not in any of the "fast lines". A test for movement of the adults from each of the six lines failed to reveal any correlated response. It is concluded that larval vagility in this stock is close to the maximum possible, and that there is no common genetic control over the tested types of movement in the two active stages of the organism's life cycle.

EWING Department of Zoology, University of Edinburgh, Scotland 1. Mixed sex groups of D. melanogaster were observed in large observation chambers in which food was available. The ratio of mated to virgin females was 3:1. 2. Fertilised females spent more time feeding than virgins and virgin flies spent more time in locomotor activity. 3. Most courtship behaviour took place on the food and consequently mated females received more courtships. 4. To test whether fertilised females were excluding virgin females from the food, groups of females without males were observed. The groups were composed either of virgin, or of a mixture of virgin and mated females. The results showed that even in the absence of fertilised females virgins fed less and were more active.

WELBERGEN, F.R. VAN DIJKEN and W. SCHARLOO Department of Population- and Evolutionary Biology, University of Utrecht, Padualaan 8, Utrecht, The Netherlands 1. A female choice experiment between two stocks of the sibling species Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans revealed a complete sexual isolation between the two species. 2. The courtship behaviour of males and females of the two species has been recorded is single pair matings by one observer using a microcomputer. It can be classified into the same 16 elements without stressing the species-typical aspects of the performances. 3. A detailed comparison of four courtship parameters per behavioural element, (I) percentage of total number of courtship acts, (II) percentage of total courtship time, (III) mean boutlength, and (IV) mean frequency per minute, showed a substantial quantitative differentiation of both sexes between the two closely-related species. 4. Drosophila simulans males and females are both less active in performing their behaviours than D. melanogaster. Scissoring is the major type of wingdisplay in the courtship of D. simulans males, and vibration is more common in the courtship of D. melanogaster males. Drosophila simulans females show lower frequencies per minute of all elements, except walking, extruding, and flicking. 5. Courtship duration in D. melanogaster males is controlled by the elements: orientation, following, and attempted copulation, as was shown by correlation analysis. In D. simulans males, courtship duration is mainly controlled by the elements licking and attempted copulation. However, with respect to the correlation coefficients of individual male behaviours the two species do not differ significantly. Therefore, we could not single out decisive and distinctive elements for enhancement of female's receptivity as a discriminating feature of male sexual behaviour of the two species. 6. First-order sequential analysis of intra-male dyadic transitions between adjacent behaviour elements of D. melanogaster and D. simulans shows quantitative differences primarily in transitions with either vibration or scissoring as the preceding or succeeding acts. Differences between the two female species are mainly limited to transitions in which the rejection-movements decamping and kicking are involved. 7. Analysis of inter-individual dyadic sequences gives the communicative value of male elements relative to the female elements and vice versa. In the communicative interactions with females, scissoring is the major type of wingdisplay in D. simulans males. It accomplishes the same role either in responding to the female or in stimulating the female as vibration does in D. melanogaster males. The elements standing, preening and extruding are the central behaviours of females in both species in elucidating the male elements orientation, major type of wingdisplay, licking, and attempted copulation. However, the degree to which these male elements are initiated by the female's elements differs quantitatively between the two species. These quantitative differences emphasizes the differentiation in patterns of interaction between sexes between the two species. Behaviour Vol. 101 (1987) pp. 275-310 THE EVOLUTION OF SEX-BIASED DISPERSAL IN LIONS ANNE E. PUSEY and CRAIG PACKER Department of Ecology and Behavioral Biology, University of Minnesota, 318 Church St. SE, Minneapolis MN 55455, U.S.A. Most female lions remain in their natal pride for their entire lives, but about a third emigrate before they reach four yrs of age. Most emigrating females leave either when they are evicted by an incoming male coalition or when the adult females of their pride give birth to new cubs. One cohort of females left because they avoided mating with males of their father's coalition. Cohorts of dispersing females leave together and form a new pride whose range almost always includes at least part of their natal range. Females that leave their natal pride suffer reduced fitness: dispersing females in the Serengeti first breed at a later age than non-dispersing females and dispersing Ngorongoro females suffer higher mortality. Dispersal patterns of large and small cohorts are such that pride size rarely exceeds or goes below the range of sizes that confers the maximum reproductive success per female. Pride fissions have no consistent effect on the average levels of genetic relatedness within prides. All males leave their natal pride. Most leave at a male takeover, but one male cohort was evicted by their fathers whereas several others left voluntarily during their fathers' tenure. A greater number of large</page><page sequence="118">760 VOLUME 101 male cohorts leave their natal pride than expected from their competitive ability and males rarely show an interest in mating until they enter a new pride. Larger male coalitions are more likely than small ones to gain residence in a pride adjacent to their natal pride, and also gain their first pride at a younger age. However, not all large cohorts are so successful because most cohorts of 6-8 males permanently split up soon after emigrating from their natal pride. About half of the secondary dispersal shown by resident adult coalitions is voluntary. Such voluntary secondary movements occur in three contexts: the coalition (1) annexes an additional pride thereby gaining access to more females (2) abandons one of several simultaneously held prides to spend more time with prides in which their cubs are younger and hence more vulnerable to infanticide (3) abandons one pride for another pride. In the third case males only abandon small cubs when going to much larger numbers of females, but they may abandon more females for fewer when their daughters are reaching maturity in the former pride. Males rarely reside in prides once their daughters have matured, and rarely return to breed in their natal pride. Compared to the large Serengeti population, the small isolated Ngorongoro population has lower levels of dispersal, higher levels of homozygosity and some deleterious effects of inbreeding. Behaviour Vol. 101 (1987) pp. 311-319 TEMPORAL RULES REGULATING AFFILIATIVE VOCAL EXCHANGES OF SQUIRREL MONKEYS NOBUO MASATAKA and MAXEEN BIBEN Laboratory of Comparative Ethology, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, U.S.A. All contact calls (chuck vocalizations) occurring in a group of ten captive squirrel monkeys were recorded over 200 minutes. The temporal distribution of inter-chuck intervals was bimodal, with one peak at short intervals (0.1-0.2 sec) and another peak at relatively longer intervals (1.4-1.5 sec). Sequalae analysis revealed that in two consecutive chucks separated by intervals longer than 0.5 sec, the following call took place independently of the preceding chuck. If two chucks occurred at intervals of 0.5 sec or less, on the other hand, the following caller vocalized in response to the preceding vocalization. The results indicate that if squirrel monkeys intend to respond to chucks given by others, they should do so within the next 0.5 sec. Otherwise, they should not vocalize during that period. This temporal rule allows the animals to determine whether a caller of the following chuck really responds to the preceding call or not, when two chucks are heard consecutively.</page><page sequence="119">VOLUME 102 761 Behaviour Vol. 102 (1987) pp. 1-14 EXPERIMENTS ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE HEN AND CHICK (GALLUS GALLUS): THE ROLE OF THE AUDITORY MODE IN RECOGNITION AND THE EFFECTS OF MATERNAL SEPARATION J.P. KENT Ballyrichard House, Arklow, Co. Wicklow, Ireland In a series of 6 experimental studies, the means by which a chick recognises its mother, and the reversibility of filial attachments were examined using bantam hens and their chicks. In a simultaneous discrimination test it was determined that the chick could discriminate between own and alien hens by means of the hens' cluck vocalizations, on the 4th and 8th days post hatching, (Experiment 1). The chicks could make this discrimination more efficiently when live hens were presented (Experiment 2). On separating the hen and chicks for 4 h on the 4th day, the chicks could no longer discriminate between own and an alien live hen (Experiment 3) while they would accept an alien hen, (Experiment 4). These findings suggest that maternal-filial bonds may be reversed with little difficulty. Thus Experiment 5 was designed to examine the stability of these later maternal filial bonds. Chicks spent the first 3 days post hatching, with the hen who incubated the eggs. Then they spent 3 days with an alien hen, after which 3 days isolation followed. It was found that chicks could discriminate in favour of their own hen after the first period of exposure, and in favour of the alien hen after the second period of exposure. Following 3 days isolation they showed no preference for either hen. Experiment 6 was essentially a replication of Experiment 5, but included a control for familiarity. Only one test took place after the 3 days isolation. The chicks were presented with the 1st, 2nd and an unfamiliar alien hen. The chicks did not discriminate in favour of any particular hen. It is concluded that after 4 h or 3 days isolation, the chicks did not discriminate between the hens presented, yet they remained responsive to hens. Behaviour Vol. 102 (1987) pp. 15-40 SEMANTICS OF AN AVIAN ALARM CALL SYSTEM: THE MALE DOMESTIC FOWL, GALLUS DOMESTICUS MARCEL GYGER, PETER MARLER and ROBERTA PICKERT The Rockefeller University, Field Research Center, Millbrook, New York 12545, U.S.A. Vocal alarm signals of male domestic fowl given in the presence of predators and other ground and aerial objects were recorded and analyzed. Studies were conducted under semi-naturalistic conditions and a telemetric technique was used to facilitate high quality sound recording. Cockerels gave ground alarm calls specifically to objects moving on the substrate and aerial alarm calls to objects moving above in free space. Vocalizations were associated with both dangerous and harmless objects. We therefore investigated variation in sound structure of aerial alarm calls with reference to flying predators and non- predators. A multidimensional contingency table analysis revealed a significant tendency for qualitatively different aerial alarm calls to be associated with flying predators and non-predators. Differences in call structure were restricted to the two first units of the alarm call. We tested the hypotheses that variation in aerial alarm call structure might be affected by either the distance separating the bird from the object or the angular size of the object projected onto the retina of the cockerel. Statistical analysis showed that the angular size was a good predictor of variation of the second unit of alarm call. The distance it self was less predictive. The first unit of the alarm call was not affected by either the distance or the angular size of the object. We propose that this part of the call has a more general function of alerting the conspecific companions. We conclude that alarm vocalizations of male domestic fowl refer specifically to a certain type of stimulus object, either moving on the ground or flying. For alarm calls correlated with aerial stimuli the specific angular size of a stimulus object moving in the air is a good predictor of call structure. We suggest that this way of dealing with flying objects as stimuli for alarm calls is the result of a predator detection strategy in which the benefits of an expanded field of vision, an important adaptation for ground-dwelling birds, exceed the costs of alarming to harmless birds and other aerial objects.</page><page sequence="120">762 VOLUME 102 Behaviour Vol. 102 (1987) pp. 41-57 ACQUISITION OF PREDATOR INFORMATION BY ACTIVE AND PASSIVE MOBBERS IN RING-BILLED GULL COLONIES MICHAEL R. CONOVER Department of Plant Pathology and Ecology, The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, P.O. Box 1106, New Haven, CT 06504, U.S.A. Mobbing flocks of ring-billed gulls consisted to two groups: individuals whose nests were near to and threatened by the predator (active mobbers) and others from more distant parts of the colony (passive mobbers). This study examined whether either group can learn about the predator from their mobbing experience. The active mobbers quickly habituated to a human intruder near their nests when the intruder was inactive and empty-handed. Conversely, the gulls responded with a greater flock size and flight distance and fewer swoops when the intruder was holding an adult gull. These response patterns persisted even after the adult gull was removed and the human intruder reappeared alone. When the human intruder held a chick, the gulls approached more closely and swooped more than when the intruder held an adult gull. To examine whether passive mobbers learned anything about the human intruder during the earlier tests, the intruder (now empty-handed) moved to a new location 50 m away and repeated the test. The gulls at these sites, also were significantly less wary than naive gulls of the human intruder following tests in which the intruder was empty-handed, and more wary following tests in which the intruder held an adult gull. Because the earlier test sites were situated so that they could not be seen from the ground at the 50 m sites, a gull at the latter sites could only have learned details about the intruder if it or some of its neighbors had become mobbers. Gulls whose nests were 100 m from an owl model or human intruder learned less about in than gulls at 50 m: perhaps because fewer gulls became passive mobbers as the distance between them and the owl or intruder increased. Costs of becoming a passive mobber include an energetic and time cost and some risk of personal injury due to mid-air collisions with other gulls. The number of passive mobbers increased on breezy days perhaps because strong updrafts on those days reduced the energetic costs of flight within the colonies (and hence of being a mobber). These results support the hypothesis that the gulls' predator-attraction behavior allows them to learn about predators from watching predator-conspecific interactions. The opportunity to witness such interactions and learn about predators may be an important secondary benefit of coloniality for these birds. Behaviour Vol. 102 (1987) pp. 58-66 EVALUATING SEX DIFFERENCES IN AGGRESSIVENESS IN CATTLE, BISON AND RHESUS MONKEYS VIKTOR REINHARDT, ANNIE REINHARDT and CATHERINE REINHARDT Wisconsin Regional Primate Research Center, 1223 Capitol Court, Madison, Wisconsin 53715, U.S.A. The assumption has often been made that aggressiveness is predominantly a masculine characteristic (e.g. COLLIAS, 1944; MOYER, 1974; SCOTT, 1975; Bouissou, 1983a, b). Many investigators simply accept the idea that males are more aggressive than females. Based on generally applicable operational terms, the validity of the "notion of universal male aggressive- ness" (JOHNSON, 1972) has been tested in three different mammalian species. The study was done under nonexperimental conditions by scoring partner-directed aggressions (potentially injurious actions) among members of three undisturbed, heterogeneous groups of Bos taurus, Bison bison and Macaca mulatta. The expression of aggression was regulated by the number of subordinate partners (animals who, without being the target of aggression, consistently withdrew), with high-ranking individuals having more oppor- tunities to display aggressions than low-ranking individuals. Hence, it was self-evident that, whenever the two sexes differed in dominance status (number of subordinates), they also differed in terms of aggression rate (total number of aggressions shown per unit time). The average number of aggressions directed by dominant animals against individual subordinate partners (aggression index: REINHARDT &amp; REINHARDT, 1975) did not exhibit a significant sex difference in any of the three species studied (Bos taurus: Xf- 1.8 vs km = 1.8; Bison bison: Xf = 6.9 vs km = 6.6; Macaca mulatta: Xf = 4.1 vs Xm = 2.9). This was not only true in general but was also consistently confirmed when comparing the sexes within different age classes (adults and juveniles). From this it was inferred that the two sexes were equally aggressive in the general day-to-day situation of dominance reinforcement in all three species. The data thus did not support the general belief that mammalian males are more aggressive than females.</page><page sequence="121">VOLUME 102 763 Behaviour Vol. 102 (1987) pp. 67-81 SONG LEARNING IN CROSS-FOSTERED ZEBRA FINCHES: A RE-EXAMINATION OF THE SENSITIVE PHASE N.S. CLAYTON Department of Zoology and Marine Biology, The University, St. Andrews, Fife KY16 9TS, Scotland Male zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, which have been normally-raised or cross-fostered to Bengalese finches, Lonchura striata, learn from a song tutor with whom they are housed during the sensitive phase, between 35 to 70 days of age. If the tutor is a different species from the father or foster-father however, then the tendency to learn during this time is much less and some males will produce song heard before 35 days. None of the birds in this study learnt after 70 days, although some lost song elements or added improvised ones. These results suggests that specific types of experience influence when a young bird learns its song. It seems that exposure to "poor" song during the sensitive phase stimulates the bird remember song heard previously and blocks further learning after this time. These results are compared with those obtained in imprinting studies. Behaviour Vol. 102 (1987) pp. 82-118 REPRODUCTIVE BEHAVIOUR AND ECOLOGY OF SYMPHODUS (CRENILABRUS) OCELLATUS, A EUROPEAN WRASSE WITH FOUR TYPES OF MALE BEHAVIOUR MICHAEL TABORSKY and BARBARA HUDDE Max-Planck-Institut fur Verhaltensphysiologie, D-8131 Seewiesen, B.R.D. PETER WIRTZ Institut fur Biologie I, Albertstraf3e 21a, Universitat Freiburg, D-7800 Freiburg, B.R.D. The temperate, gonochoristic wrasse Symphodus ocellatus was studied in the field (Corsica). The largest males defend an area within which an average of 3-5 successive nests are built from algae. These brightly coloured, paternal, territorial males (T-males) spend between one and two thirds of their time during the 10-day nest cycle building the nest and fanning. They eat very little at this time, although they consume eggs and invertebrates in the nest, including egg predators. T-males occasionally take over neighbouring nests. Nest acquisition has two functions: nourishment (2/3 of all take-overs) and reproduction (1/3). T-males practising the latter save over 1/3 of the time of a complete nest cycle. Most take-over males that acquire nests solely for nourishment fan it, as do their reproducing counterparts. Small males with inconspicuous female colouration roam about and try to fertilize eggs parasitically when females spawn in T-males' nests. There are usually several of these "sneakers" around successful nests. Medium sized males (smaller than T-males and differently coloured) also cuckold T-males, but often display submissively to them. They participate in nest defence against conspecifics and in interactions with females, with an average effort that even exceeds that of the nest owners. Males displaying this "satellite behaviour" feed much less than sneakers and remain at one nest during most of its spawning phase. They are more tolerated by T-males than are sneakers, although they are on average only half as far away from the nest and thus much more frequently encountered by the T-male. The proportion of time a male spends as a satellite depends on its size. Usually only the largest accessory male at a nest behaves in this manner, though smaller males occasionally perform elements of satellite behaviour. Satellites never participate in nest building, courtship, direct broodcare or interspecific defence, nor do they take over abandoned nests. A fourth type of male, similar in size and appearance to sneakers and satellites, refrains from reproduction in a specific year. These males are perhaps future T-males. All females seem to participate in reproduction every year. They spawn repeatedly in the same nest over one day, but often change nests and T-males on successive days. Male tactic are roughly determined by size, but there are still choices to be made, such as when to give up a nest which has little spawning success, whether to build a nest or to attempt a take-over, or when to reproduce and whether to adopt the sneaker or satellite roles. The simultaneous occurrence of T-males, satellites and sneakers within a species is compared to a few other examples of diverse taxa.</page><page sequence="122">764 VOLUME 102 Behaviour Vol. 102 (1987) pp. 119-128 THE OCCURRENCE, CONTEXT AND FUNCTIONAL SIGNIFICANCE OF AGGRESSIVE BEGGING BEHAVIOURS IN YOUNG AMERICAN WHITE PELICANS KEVIN J. CASH and ROGER M. EVANS Department of Zoology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, R3T 3A1 Aggressive behaviours occurring in association with about 90% of all feedings developed in American white pelican chicks approximately three weeks old. These behaviours involved aggression directed toward self (Convulsion) and other young (Aggression). Observation of feedings revealed that: (1) when both Convulsion and Aggression occurred before or after a given feeding, convulsion bore a closer temporal relationship to the feed itself than did Aggression, (2) the frequency of both Aggression and Convulsion prior to feeding increased as the length of the begging bout increased, (3) the frequency of Convulsion and Aggression following feeding was not related to the duration of the feed but did depend on the amount fed (as measured by throat distension). Observations of identifiable parents and chicks revealed that most chicks receive a single feeding each day, each parent returning to the colony every two days. The frequency of multiple feeds given to the same chick on the same day or (by the presumed same parent) two days later was not related to the frequency of Aggression or Convulsion given after a feeding. The close association of these displays with feeding and low-intensity begging suggests that they function primarily as begging displays or, for Aggression, to drive other young away from the parent food source. Evidence suggesting that Convulsion may be a manifestation of parent-offspring conflict is discussed. Alternative proposed functions of Convulsion and Aggression are not supported by data collected in this study. Behaviour Vol. 102 (1987) pp. 129-146 DETERMINANTS OF SOCIAL RANK IN GOOSE FLOCKS: ACQUISITION OF SOCIAL RANK IN YOUNG GEESE JEFFREY M. BLACK and MYRFYN OWEN The Wildfowl Trust, Slimbridge, Gloucestershire, U.K. GL2 7BT The paper describes a study of social rank acquisition in goslings reared from eggs taken from a full- winged flock of barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis) at the Wildfowl Trust, Slimbridge. Eggs were taken from pairs of known history and the adult's aggressiveness was ranked according to their reaction to Itumans. This rank was showed to be meaningful intraspecifically both by the outcome of encounters between geese and by the fact that no pairs scored as non-aggressive were able to nest in the preferred colony. A group of goslings reared by their own parents and cross-fostered goslings were also examined. 1. Within a rearing group of goslings (sibling-reared broods), the oldest and heaviest birds ranked highest in the first month and males performed better in encounters than females of the same size in the second month. 2. In encounters between unfamiliar goslings from different sibling-broods in the third month of life, the most important determinants of the new rank were body size, weight and sex. Previous experience also influenced rank; previous success yielded continued success. Goslings lost weight during the test; loss was negatively correlated with rank. The performance of goslings reared without adults bore no relationship to their parent's aggressive score. 3. In the semi-captive flock, parents that scored as "aggressive" reared more and larger goslings than non-aggressive pairs. The rank of these in the third month correlated with their size and sex (independent of size). The cross-fostering experiment suggested that there was a genetic as well as an environmental influence on rank acquisition. 4. In encounters between goslings of similar rank from sibling-broods and parent-reared ones, the latter ranked significantly higher. Parent-reared goslings, though less familiar to the experimental regime, gained weight and goslings from sibling-broods lost weight. 5. Once established, rank order remained stable, the few reversals related either to changes in size or to cooperation between goslings in confrontations. 6. Parental quality clearly affects, through learning and heredity, the physical and social development of goslings, and consequently their chances of survival and reproduction. We suggest that these effects are reinforced by brood size; larger families gain better resources in competitive situations. In wild geese,</page><page sequence="123">VOLUME 102 765 competitive ability is crucial both to survival in winter and to the acquisition of nesting sites and rearing areas for the young. Behaviour Vol. 102 (1987) pp. 147-167 QUEEN REGULATION OF WORKER FORAGING IN PAPER WASPS: A SOCIAL FEEDBACK CONTROL SYSTEM (POLISTES FUSCATUS, HYMENOPTERA: VESPIDAE) HUDSON K. REEVE Section of Neurobiology and Behavior, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, U.S.A. GEORGE J. GAMBOA Department of Biological Sciences, Oakland University, Rochester, MI 48063, U.S.A. We examined the queen's role in regulation of worker foraging in small field colonies of the primitively eusocial wasp, Polistes fuscatus (29 colonies; 148 h observation). Queen removal results in a significant reduction in worker departure rate. The placement of a cooled, inactive queen into her queenless nest produces a significantly greater reduction in worker departure rate than does queen removal, and the resumption of activity by an inactive queen causes a significant increase in worker departure rate. Removal or cooling of a single worker does not produce similar effects on worker foraging, suggesting that the queen is the central regulator of worker foraging in small P fuscatus colonies. We present evidence that: (1) the queen's control of worker foraging is mediated primarily by her influence on worker nest activity, (2) queen aggression may be important in stimulating departures by workers with low tendencies to leave the nest (i.e., dominant workers), and (3) the magnitude of the queen's stimulatory influence on worker foraging is directly related to the number of workers on the nest. We integrate these results with evidence from our other studies of polistine colony dynamics in a feed-back control model of the social regulation of foraging. Behaviour Vol. 102 (1987) pp. 168-184 INTERSPECIFIC AGGRESSION BY BARROW'S GOLDENEYE: A DESCRIPTIVE AND FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS JEAN-PIERRE L. SAVARD Canadian Wildlife Service, P.O. Box 340, Delta, B.C., Canada V4K 3Y3 JAMES N.M. SMITH Department of Zoology, University of British Columbia, 6270 University Boulevard, Vancouver, B.C., Canada V6T 2A9 We describe interspecific aggression and territoriality by a diving duck, the Barrow's goldeneye. Males of this species are strongly interspecifically territorial early during the breeding season, and in winter. Females are interspecifically territorial while tending broods of ducklings. Aggression was strongest against conspecifics, and against the congeneric bufflehead, which shares the same breeding habitat. Other diving ducks, which overlap in diet with goldeneyes, were frequently attacked, while dabbling ducks, with differing feeding habits, were generally tolerated, and were seldom attacked. One dabbling duck, the blue- winged teal, in which the drake resembles the Barrow's goldeneye drake in plumage, was attacked more strongly than other dabblers. We propose that the strong interspecific aggressiveness exhibited by the Barrow's goldeneye, and its congeners the bufflehead and common goldeneye, is a consequence of the strong intraspecific aggressiveness of these species. Selectivity in aggression towards victims of different species can be explained by two hypotheses. Species that have (1) similar diets, and (2) similar plumages to Barrow's goldeneye are selectively attacked. Behaviour Vol. 102 (1987) pp. 185-195 WHY MUDSKIPPERS BUILD WALLS D.A.

Box 111, SF-80101 Joensuu 10, Finland Differences in the song repertoires of males and in the song-pools of the thrush nightingale populations were studied in 1972, 1983 and 1984 in southern Finland. Changes in male repertoires and in the song-pool of one population were monitored in 1972 and 1980-1985. The thrush nightingales in a local population had repertoires that were more similar to each other than to those of the males in other local populations. The similarity of the repertoires decreased with increasing distance, but there were no clearcut dialect boundaries between local populations. The song repertoire of a male was more similar to that of the adjacent males than to his own repertoire of the previous year. The similarity of the repertoires of adjacent singers increased during the singing period. This similarity was partly due to the same song-types being used with about equal frequency, but obviously the males were also able to learn new songs from their adjacent singers. After dispersal to a breeding area thrush nightingales learn at least some new song-types, even at the age of two to four years. Some old breeders were able to copy new song-types from the immigrants (mostly young males) or the playback tape. The newly copied song-types were loud and simple in structure, whereas the song-types soon to be abandoned were weak in amplitude. In one population, studied from 1980 to 1985, the repertoires of the males tended to become more similar in successive years. This tendency, however, did not occur in 1984 when the proportion of immigrants in the population was unusually high. The major changes in local song traditions were due to "cultural diffusion" by males originating from areas with other traditions; this diffusion greatly enriched the local song-pool, especially in years when the rate of immigration was high. Behaviour Vol. 102 (1987) pp. 213-230 DEFENCE AS PARENTAL CARE IN TAWNY OWLS (STRIXALUCO) KJELL WALLIN Department of Zoology, University of Goteborg, Box 250 59, S-400 31 Goteborg, Sweden Parental defence was studied during the breeding season with individually marked tawny owls (Strix aluco). Attacking tawny owls pose a serious threat to an intruder because of their dangerous talons. As predicted by theory, parental defence was positively correlated with offspring age and brood size. Pairs with equal numbers of offspring but with different initial clutch sizes showed equal defence levels. The level of defence is therefore determined more by expected gain in number of offspring produced than by cumulative investment. Pairs breeding early in the season defended more strongly than those breeding later on. This was partly explained by a seasonal decrease in brood size, but the trend also persisted within each brood size. One possible explanation is that the probability of breeding failure increase as the breeding season progresses, making a risky defence less worthwhile for late-breeding pairs. The level of defence was positively correlated with the female's body mass. Defence behaviour did not change significantly with female age. Females in pairs that defended their offspring had a lower probability of breeding the following season than did females in non-defending pairs. Individual females changed their defence behaviour between years in relation to their seasonal start of breeding, suggesting that parental defence is a plastic behaviour.</page><page sequence="125">VOLUME 102 767 Behaviour Vol. 102 (1987) pp.231-238 DISTANCE TO COVER, VISUAL OBSTRUCTIONS, AND VIGILANCE IN HOUSE SPARROWS STEVEN L. LIMA Behavioural Ecology Research Group, Department of Biological Sciences, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada V5A 1S6 House sparrows (Passer domesticus) feeding away from protective cover decrease their level of vigilance as group size increases. In contrast to recent studies, however, their level of vigilance decreases when feeding farther from cover or in the presence of visual obstructions. These apparent discrepancies reflect the potential complexity in the response of vigilance to various aspects of the risk of predation; scanning need not necessarily increase with the risk of predation. Much work as to the exact nature of the factors influencing vigilance remains to be done before we can fully understand its response to various environmental manipulations. Behaviour Vol. 102 (1987) pp. 239-263 PERCEPTUAL IMPRINTING: STIMULUS PREFERENCES, AGE EFFECTS, AND GENETIC CANALIZATION JOSEPH K. KOVACH Research Department, The Menninger Foundation, Topeka, Ks 66601, U.S.A. The separate and interactive influences of genetically variable unconditional stimulus preference, age ef- fects, and genetic canalization were studied in relation to perceptual imprinting in Japanese quail chicks (C. coturnix japonica). The chicks were drawn from populations subjected to 21 generations of bidi- rectional genetic selection for unconditional approach preference between blue and red stimuli. They were tested for age and stimulus effects in perceptual learning from synergistic and conflicting exposures to the genetically preferred and genetically unpreferred colours. Unselected quail chicks were tested as genetic controls, and the qualitative influences of exposures to colours were controlled by comparable exposures to white and other preference-wise neutral stimuli. The results indicate robust and develop- mentally stable gene effects in the quail's unconditional colour choices, developmentally persistent but episodically variable learning from exposures to colours of genetically variable preference values, and systematic genotype-environment interactions. Discussion focuses on the canalizing role of genetically variable unconditional stimulus preferences in the early developmental of behaviour.

Two types of analysis were performed on the discharge patterns of 10 Gnathonemus petersii: (1) The Bout Interval Criterion method was used to categorise the intervals between consecutive electric pulses; (2) an analysis of sequences of acts was performed to study the serial ordering of the interpulse intervals. Interpulse intervals were demonstrated to belong to distinct classes, having similar limits for most animals. Most fish show five classes of interpulse intervals (23 to 68 ms; 69 to 108 ms; 109 to 170 ms; 171 to 212 ms; &gt; 212 ms), to which a sixth class (&lt; 23 ms) is added in some cases. Each class contains a similar number of intervals in all individuals. Particular associations were found between the occurrences of interpulse intervals belonging to different classes. Some of these associations (for example BB and EC) are displayed by most fish, whereas others express individual differences in the patterns of discharge. The discharge of immobile, undisturbed, isolated mormyrid fish is thus shown to present many similarities among individuals. Inter-individual differences exist only in the serial ordering of the intervals, where they are best regarded as variations around a same theme.</page><page sequence="126">768 VOLUME 102 The absence of overlapping between the two main categories of interpulse intervals (category I: 69 to 108 ms; category II: 171 to 212 ms), as well as the constancy of their baselines, suggest that two oscillating systems participate to the electromotor command. The stochastic analysis of the serial ordering of the interpulse intervals suggest in addition that these two oscillators do not function independently. Momentaneous modifications of the activity of these two oscillators would provide an economical ex- planation for the various changes in the types of interpulse intervals associated with behavioural state or social interactions. Behaviour Vol. 102 (1987) pp. 283-316 RUTTING BEHAVIOR IN AFRICAN ELEPHANTS: THE PHENOMENON OF MUSTH JOYCE H. POOLE Sub-department of Animal Behaviour, Cambridge University, Madingley, Cambridge, CB3 8AA, England 1. The physical and behavioral characteristics and the temporal patterning of musth were studied over a ten-year period in a free-ranging population of African elephants. 2. Males spent more time in association with females during musth than during non-musth periods. 3. Males were more aggressive during their musth periods than during non-musth. 4. The occurrence and duration of musth were age-related: no male under 24 years was seen in musth; bouts of musth among younger individuals were short and sporadic, while older males experienced longer more predictable periods of musth on an annual basis. 5. Although males in musth were observed year-round, the frequency of musth males was highest during and following the two rainy seasons and, in general, good rainfall years had higher frequencies of males in musth than did poor rainfall years. 6. The number of males in musth per month correlated closely with the number of females observed in estrus. However, since the period of estrus lasts only four to six days (Moss, 1983), while musth may last several months, the onset of musth was not necessarily triggered by the onset of estrus in a particular female. 7. The musth periods of different males were asynchronous and each male came into musth at a specific time of year. This period was relatively consistent from one year to the next, particularly among the older males. 8. Males in musth advertised their heightened sexual and aggressive state through visual and olfactory signals and by vocalizing. It is suggested that these signals function to announce identity, condition and location to both rival males and to potentially receptive females. 9. The physical and behavioral characteristics and temporal patterning of musth in African and Asian elephants are compared and found to be remarkably similar. 10. The physical and behavioral manifestations of musth in elephants are similar to those described for other male mammals during rut. Since estrus in female elephants is less clumped relative to most ungulates, male elephants have a different temporal pattern of rutting. Although the musth periods of male elephants are asynchronous the phenomenon can functionally be considered a rutting period.</page><page sequence="127">VOLUME 103 769 Behaviour Vol. 103 (1987) pp. 1-15 THE SIGNIFICANCE OF ANTIPHONAL VOCALISATION BY THE SPRING PEEPER, PSEUDACRIS CRUCIFER (AMPHIBIA, ANURA) DON C. FORESTER and W. KEITH HARRISON Biological Sciences/Institute of Animal Behavior, Towson State University, Towson, Maryland U.S.A. 21204 1. Male spring peepers respond to acoustic interference from an encroaching conspecific with a graded behavioral sequence: they increase their call repetition rate, they emit one or more encounter calls, they entrain their calls to those of the intruder. 2. Once entrained, males continue to call synchronously for extended periods. 3. The time interval between the end of the leader's call and the beginning of the follower's call (the intraduet interval) is consistent, and is maintained despite changes in the duration or repetition rate of the leader's call. 4. Our data corroborate earlier investigators who concluded that the follower is stimulated by the onset of the leader's call, but is inhibited from calling until a fixed time interval after the leader has ceased calling. 5. Controlled discrimination tests reveal no differential mating success by the leader or the follower within a simulated duet. 6. Females exhibited a significant preference for a duet over a soloing male. 7. Although test females were able distinguish between the simultaneous broadcast of two phase-locked call sequences differing only in frequency, they did so in the absence of alternative, uncovered calls. 8. We conclude that antiphonal vocalisation functions primarily to reduce the potential for broadcast interference during the initial phase of female phonotaxis. Behaviour Vol. 103 (1987) pp. 16-26 ACOUSTIC COMMUNICATION IN WOODHOUSE'S TOAD (BUFO WOODHOUSEI). II. RESPONSE OF FEMALES TO VARIATION IN SPECTRAL AND TEMPORAL COMPONENTS OF ADVERTISEMENT CALLS BRIAN K. SULLIVAN and MARJORIE R. LEEK Department of Zoology, and Department of Speech and Hearing Science, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287 U.S.A. We tested the hypothesis that acoustic stimuli must be similar to the species-typical advertisement call in both dominant frequency and pulse rate to attract female Woodhouse's toads (Bufo woodhousei) in discrimination trials. Using synthetic advertisement call we determined that females always preferred a synthetic call with the species-specific pulse rate and frequency over synthetic calls in which only pulse rate or frequency was within the range for the species. However, appropriately pulsed, narrow-band filtered noise was a sufficient acoustic stimulus to attract 20% of the females in one-quarter of their discrimination trials. These results are discussed in light of species recognition in bufonids. Behaviour Vol. 103 (1987) pp. 27-48 THE DYNAMICS OF SNAKE HARASSMENT BY BLACK-TAILED PRAIRIE DOGS W.J. LOUGHRY Animal Behavior Graduate Group, Department of Psychology, University of California, Davis, California 95616 U.S.A. Differential participation by particular classes of individuals is likely to influence how we assess the functional significance of harassing. I examined encounters between black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) and snakes in both natural and experimentally-induced encounters and found substantial differences in how various age/sex classes of prairie dogs deal with snakes. Specifically, males spent more time close to snakes and in actively confronting these potential predators than did either females or pups. Fathers were not closer to snakes than were non-fathers, but fathers spent more time actively engaged in dealing with the snakes. Mothers and non-mothers did not differ markedly in how they dealt with snakes. Encounters with snakes occurred before and after the pups first emergence from their natal burrows, but pup emergence did not alter the basic differences between males and females and fathers and non-fathers. Pup emergence did coincide with changes in the behavior of these classes, fathers barked</page><page sequence="128">770 VOLUME 103 less after pup emergence, and all classes with the exception of mothers were less positively oriented to snakes after pup emergence. However, the significance of these changes was not apparent. These results require that the functional significance of snake harassment by prairie dogs take into ac- count this male bias in snake-directed behavior. Males are hypothesized to be less vulnerable to snakes than are pups and to have more at stake reproductively than do females. Fathers have more at stake re- productively than do non-fathers (although non-fathers may still be protecting mates) and thus should spend more time confronting and harassing snakes. This interpretation is founded on an understanding of the relationship between potential predator and potential prey and I conclude with a discussion of the appropriate description of this relationship. Behaviour Vol. 103 (1987) pp.49-67 DISTRIBUTION AND VARIABILITY OF SONG TYPES IN THE WOOD THRUSH CARL L. WHITNEY and JOAN MILLER Rockefeller University Field Research Center, Millbrook, New York, U.S.A. Compared to the song of other oscine species, wood thrush song shows little macrogeographical variation: 1) Most song types defined for a local population are widespread over the geographical range, 2) the relative abundances of different song types are similar in samples taken from different locations, and 3) a given song type is no more variable in structure over the geographical range than within a local population. Wood thrush song also shows little microgeographical variation. The degree of song type sharing does not vary as a function of the distance between males in a local population. Song remains stable over time in a local population, as indicated by a similarity in the relative abundances of song types in samples taken 14 years apart. Regarding the distribution of song types among repertoires, 1) Different combinations of song types within repertoires occur no more or less often than expected by chance, 2) different versions of a single song type are distributed at random among repertoires, 3) large repertoires do not contain a greater proportion of rare (unclassified) songs than small repertoires, and 4) rare songs are not clustered in the repertoires of certain individuals.

Male-only groups with (group 1) and without (group 2) availability of nestboxes were compared for the amount of song, for testicular size and plasma titers of luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone. Testicular size and LH differed significantly between the 2 groups, being higher in males with nestboxes. Similar differences, as well as differences in nestbox-related behaviors (sitting in front of a nestbox, inspecting it, and nestbuilding) were also found when individuals of group 1, in possession of a nestbox, were compared to those without. In another group (2), the seasonal dependence of nestboxes as a modifying factor was investigated. These males were given access to nestboxes later in the season, than the males of group 1, after April 7. The effects on physiological parameters at this time of year were negligible in that only a transient increase in LH was seen compared to group 3. Nestbox-oriented behaviors did not reach the same intensities as in group 1. These results demonstrate the importance of nest-site availability in modifying behavioral and physiological functions during the vernal reproductive cycle. At the same time they indicate a seasonal dependence in these modifying effects.</page><page sequence="129">VOLUME 103 771 Behaviour Vol. 103 (1987) pp. 83-107 THE IMPORTANCE OF VISION IN AGONISTIC COMMUNICATION OF THE CRAYFISH ORCONECTES RUSTICUS. I: AN ANALYSIS OF BOUT DYNAMICS COLLEEN ANN BRUSKI and D.W. DUNHAM Department of Zoology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S lAl Canada 1. The importance of vision for efficient agonistic communication was investigated in the rusty crayfish, Orconectes rusticus, a species active both day and night. Agonistic bout dynamics were analyzed from isosexual pairs of males and females interacting under moderate (350 lux) and dim (11 lux) light levels, and in complete darkness (using infrared video recording). Under dim light we determined the effect of visual light and dark adaptation on communication. 2. As light diminished, bouts became less frequent, but longer, and the crayfish invested more time and performed more acts when resolving bouts. Thus, communication efficiency was clearly lower in the dark than under moderate light, for both sexes. Males performed more acts than females overall, and were generally more aggressive than females. 3. The frequency of visually-mediated behaviours (i.e. Lunge, Follow) decreased in the absence of light, while tactile behaviours (e.g. Antenna Tap, Chela Strike, Push) were performed more frequently. Males especially performed more highly aggressive tactile behaviours in the dark. It was shown that some behaviours previously considered to be visually mediated (e.g. Meral Spread) are also tactually or propri- oceptively mediated, and some behaviours assumed to be tactually mediated (e.g. antennal movements) are probably also visually mediated. 4. Under dim light, crayfish with light-adapted eyes resolve bouts more efficiently in terms of time and energy investment than do dark-adapted animals. This is consistent with the effects of pigment migrations during dark adaptation in the crayfish superposition compound eye, which enhance visual sensitivity, but decrease acuity. We suggest that dark adaptation diminishes a crayfishes ability to deal with the subtleties of visual communication, but may well enhance its ability to detect predators. Behaviour Vol. 103 (1987) pp. 108-122 FEEDING-VIGILANCE TRADE-OFF IN THE TEAL (ANAS CRECCA): EFFECTS OF FEEDING METHOD AND PREDATION RISK HANNU POYSA Department of Biology, University of Joensuu, P.O. Box 111, SF-80101 Joensuu, Finland Feeding and vigilance are conflicting demands in teal (Anas crecca) that use feeding methods where the eyes are beneath the water surface. This trade-off was compared across different beneath-surface feeding methods (head submerged, neck submerged, up-ending) and between the absence and presence of live predators, ospreys (Pandion haliaetus). A comparison across feeding methods indicated that the proportion of time spent scanning for predators and scanning rate decreased from head submerged to up- ending. Similarly, within a particular feeding method the level of vigilance decreased as average feeding bout length increased. Teals thus sacrificed vigilance as foraging demands increased. When a predator was present, however, teals increased the proportion of time spent scanning at the expense of feeding time in all feeding methods. This was achieved by lengthening scanning bouts, not by increasing scanning rate. As a consequence, feeding efficiency decreased. Feeding methods differed in terms of predator detection probability. An examination of the role of grouping in increasing predator detection probability indicated, however, that grouping would provide only a marginal benefit to foraging teals in this respect, whatever the feeding method. Behaviour Vol. 103 (1987) pp. 123-140 COSTS AND BENEFITS OF GROUP FORAGING IN THE TEAL (ANAS CRECCA) HANNU POYSA Department of Biology, University of Joensuu, P.O. Box Ill, SF-80101 Joensuu, Finland This study examines group foraging in the teal (Anas crecca) in the light of some hypothesized foraging and anti-predator effects of grouping. Results suggest that group foraging in the teal acts as an adaptation to exploit spatially and temporally variable feeding environments. First, in a particular feeding patch, teals responded numerically to the variation in prey abundance. Second, foraging groups attracted teals</page><page sequence="130">772 VOLUME 103 flying over them. Third, arrivals landed close to the foragers and copied feeding methods used by them. However, the use of marginal feeding sites within the patch increased with group size. This disadvantage and the disturbance and exploitation of prey at and near the water surface may decrease foraging efficiency in large groups. Contrary to the results of several other studies, time-budgeting advantage in terms of increased feeding time and decreased vigilance time seemed not to be an important anti-predator benefit of grouping in the teal. Behaviour Vol. 103 (1987) pp. 141-156 RISK AND EFFECTIVENESS IN THE USE OF AGONISTIC DISPLAYS BY AMERICAN GOLDFINCHES JAMES W. POPP Department of Biological Sciences, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee Q153201, U.S.A. In aggressive contests over access to feeders, American goldfinches (Carduelis tristis) appeared to be using displays based on their risk and effectiveness. Display types varied in both their effectiveness and the risk of their use. The effectiveness of using a display was positively related to the risk of using that display. When the value of the resource under dispute was increased individuals used more of the riskier yet more effective displays. Associated with the increased use of the riskier displays was a greater number of en- counters ending in fights. Individuals also used display type with different frequency depending on the rel- ative dominance status of their opponent. Bluffing may have been kept at low levels among the goldfinches by the ease of detecting bluffing, due to individual recognition, and by the costs of being detected. Behaviour Vol. 103 (1987) pp. 157-173 MALE REPRODUCTIVE TACTICS IN THE LIBELLULID DRAGONFLY PALTOTHEMIS LINEATIPES: TEMPORAL PARTITIONING OF TERRITORIES JOHN ALCOCK Department of Zoology, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287, U.S.A. Males of Paltothemis lineatipes defend stream-edge territories several meters in length. Receptive females fly to the stream to oviposit in very small patches of barely submerged fine gravel; each territory contains at least one but rarely more than two patches. Territorial males intercept incoming gravid females, copulate very briefly with them while hovering a potential oviposition site, and then release their partners, which usually oviposit for less than 2 min before leaving the stream. Because mated females do not oviposit while in tandem with a male, neighboring territory owners some- times succeed in stealing females before they have completed oviposition in their first mate's territory. Interrupted females sometimes are receptive, and may copulate with an intruder and oviposit in his terri- tory. Gravid females arrive at the stream primarily in a 3 h mid-morning period during which time the density of territorial males is greatest. Fights for territories are most frequent early in the daily activity cycle, just prior to the time when receptive females are most likely to appear. There are many more males than sites with suitable oviposition substrate. Consequently competition for territories is intense, particularly at locations that attract relatively many females. From 2-4 males may claim favored territories in sequence on a given day, with the same males returning to partition ownership of the location temporally in the same order over several days. Temporal partitioning of certain territories in P. lineatipes appears to be a consequence of the males' ability to identify superior locations and superior times for territoriality, with the result that no one individual can monopolize a productive site for an entire daily flight period.

METTRICK Department of Zoology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5S lAl Fasciola hepatica is a trematode parasite of the bile duct of herbivores. Site-finding behaviour of this parasite includes a migration from the duodenum through the abdominal cavity to the liver. This study</page><page sequence="131">VOLUME 103 773 examines the behaviour of the migrating worms at two stages of the life cycle; NEJ - the stage that penetrates the small intestine, and 48HR - the stage that penetrates the liver. Compared to saline controls, crude extracts of duodenal tissue have greater effects on the behaviour of the NEJs while crude extracts of liver tissue have greater effects on the behaviour of 48HRs. Yet, neither NEJs nor 48HRs migrate up gradients of liver extracts or down gradients of duodenal extracts. Behaviour Vol. 103 (1987) pp. 187-202 THE CRITERIA DETERMINING THE SELECTION OF MUSSELS MYTILUS EDULIS BY OYSTERCATCHERS HAEMATOPUS OSTRALEGUS WILLIAM J. SUTHERLAND and BRUNO J. ENS Edward Grey Institute for Field Ornithology, Zoology Department, South Parks Road, Oxford OXI 3PS, England Ventral hammering oystercatchers tend to specialise upon attacking either the right or left valve of mussels. Both in the field and in captivity they initially select medium sized mussels. Selection against small mussels can be understood from the low profitability of small mussels, but large mussels are very profitable. The hammering oystercatchers select thin shelled mussels even though capable of opening ones with thicker shells. Once the preferred prey are depleted, they take thicker and larger mussels. Indirect evidence suggests that within a size class the profitability of thick-shelled mussels is lower. Stabbing birds open larger and thicker mussels than do hammering birds. When feeding on boiled mussels size taken is larger than when feeding on live mussels. Behaviour Vol. 103 (1987) pp. 203-216 PERSISTENCE IN FORAGING: WHEN DO BULLFINCHES ABANDON UNPROFITABLE SEEDS? PETER W. GREIG-SMITH Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Worplesdon Laboratory, Surrey, U.K. Captive bullfinches (Pyrrhula pyrrhula) were studied in order to find out if and why they abandon fruits after lengthy unsuccessful attempts to crack open the husks. For three kinds of fruits, the probability of husks cracking remained constant throughout handling. Bullfinches feeding on ash and sunflower fruits dropped many, failing to retrieve most of those that dropped in the first 12 seconds after picking up (thus identified as 'rejected'), but only 20% of those dropped later ('abandoned'). The incidence of abandoning fruits was higher in samples taken from ash trees with less variably-sized fruits, and when sunflower fruits of a particular size were presented alone, rather than in a mixture of other sizes. Both results support the idea that unsuccessful handling provides information allowing birds to revise their estimates of fruits' profitability. However, abandonment did not occur after a consistent period, as predicted. Rejection of fruits during the first few seconds of handling was a more important food selection mechanism than either visual assessment before handling, or later abandonment. Behaviour Vol. 103 (1987) pp. 217-240 INFLUENCES OF PRIOR AGONISTIC EXPERIENCES ON AGGRESSION MEASURES IN THE MALE SWORDTAIL (XIPHOPHORUS HELLERI) DIERK FRANCK and ALEXANDER RIBOWSKI Zoologisches Institut und Zoologisches Museum der Universitat Hamburg, B.R.D. The influences of prior agonistic experience on the aggressive behaviour of swordtail males were studied in standardized aggression tests. In the "standard-opponent" test the test subject fights against a much smaller opponent behind a transparent partition, whereas in the mirror test it attacks its own mirror image. Both tests are appropriate to measure mean biting rates in an adequate sample of individuals. If reproducible estimates of the aggressiveness of single individuals are needed, the mirror test is the most appropriate method, for it gives correlation coefficients up to 0.96 between a first and a second measurement. When fish had been involved in a series of escalating activities without final decision of the encounters, in subsequent mirror test their biting frequencies were elevated for at least 24 h after the last fight. Winning a rank order fight led to an increase and losing to a decrease in biting frequency 24 h later. By contrast, after social settlement in a long-term stabilized social hierarchy the relation is totally reversed: Dominant</page><page sequence="132">774 VOLUME 103 males showed much lower biting frequencies than subordinate males in the mirror test. The hypothesis is proposed that even under natural conditions high ranking males tend to use their energy potential in a more economic way than low ranking males. The existence of rank-dependent fighting strategies could be due to differences in risk: The fighting activities of dominant males are extremely risky because they can lose their high social status, which inevitably would lead to a lowered genetic fitness, whereas the aggressive actions of subordinate males are not very risky because their social is low anyway. Behaviour Vol. 103 (1987) pp. 241-258 AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOUR BETWEEN TERRITORIAL CICHLIDS (ASTATOTILAPIA BURTONI) IN RELATION TO RANK AND TERRITORIAL STABILITY ANDERS FERNO Department of Fisheries Biology, University of Berger, P.O. Box 1839, N-5011 Berger, Norway Territorial mosaics of A. burtoni were studied in the laboratory. A difference in rank between neighbouring territorial fish was usually found, with the male with higher rank exhibiting more offensive behaviour and the opponent resisting more passively. A role asymmetry in boundary disputes was found in both high- and low-intensity aggression. Linear rank orders were formed. High rank was associated with a high aggressive and sexual activity towards non-territorial fish and a high mating success. Territorial size was larger in superior males. A superior did not, however, generally expand his territory towards an inferior. This could be due to the involvement of escalated aggression with the reduction of territory. Most males of low rank did, however, eventually lose their territories. Establishing and losing territories were correlated with a low level of low-intensity aggression. Escalated fighting seldom occurred in spite of a strong competition for females, and aggression was usually limited to Frontal display and low-intensity aggression. Frontal display also played a key role for de-escalation of physical aggression. A. burtoni seems to follow the strategy "Honest", using a honestly graded display with few escalations.

BRUNO BAUR Department of Zoology, Uppsala University, Box 561, S-751 22 Uppsala, Sweden In the field hatchlings of the land snail Arianta arbustorum have been observed devouring eggs from sib as well as non-sib clutches. In the laboratory newly hatched A. arbustorum were tested for their ability to distinguish between eggs of different degrees of relatedness. In these experiments hatchlings did not discriminate between sib, other kin and non-kin eggs. Snails from three populations showed the same egg preferences, but they differed in their propensity for cannibalism. Despite the apparent lack of sib and kin recognition, egg cannibalism in A. arbustorum may be adaptive, even among siblings, because of the nutritional and energetic benefits.

The results show that fish exposed to good demonstrators were subsequently more likely to 'engage in the same operant act than same-aged fish that observed poor demonstrators. Thus the development of traditions is shown to be possible in small groups of fish of the same age, originating in the appearance of a novel, adaptive behaviour by certain innovative individuals.</page><page sequence="133">VOLUME 103 775 Behaviour Vol. 103 (1987) pp. 276-293 MIGRATORY ORIENTATION AND ACTIVITY OF THE MEADOW PWIT (ANTHUS PRATENSIS): A COMPARATIVE OBSERVATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL FIELD STUDY ANDREAS J.

Free-flying pipits migrated SW in autumn and NE in spring in sunny and overcast weather, but on average there was less migration under overcast. In the field migration peaked in the first two morning hours and was almost over by the end of October. Strong migration always corresponded to a minimal scatter of flight directions. In the orientation cages the birds oriented SW in autumn and NNW in spring, but only in sunny weather during the first three morning hours. Activity decreased markedly later in the day (spring), in November compared to September/October and under overcast compared to sunny skies. The more active the birds were, the better was their orientation with respect to the overall mean direction. In general, meaningful orientation in the cages occurred only when migration intensity in the field was maximal. A lack of well-oriented behaviour in the cage is not necessarily caused by an inability to orient, but may be a consequence of low motivation to migrate. A six hour clockshift of experimental birds did not lead to a clear shift of their directional choices, but produced an axial NE-SW orientation in autumn and disorientation is spring. This result does not support the assumption that diurnal migrants orient primarily by means of a sun compass.

TURNER School of Animal Biology, University College of North Wales, Bangor, Gwynedd LL57 2UW, U.K. The paper investigates the occurrence of submission in relation to the courtship of the biparental sexually dimorphic convict cichlid, Cichlasoma (Archocentrus) nigrofasciatum. It was found that submission by females was not necessary for courtship to proceed and such behaviour was found only in a similar context to fleeing behaviour. The presence of an intruding male, while generally involking courtship activities, did not reduce the aggressiveness of a resident female towards other conspecifics. Thus any inhibition of aggression was specific to the potential mate only. Similarly intruding males did not attack aggressive resident females, even though no symbolic inferiority was performed. It is suggested that inhibition of aggression towards the partner can occur in the absence of symbolic inferiority and proposed that a new terminology be adopted. Particular activities involved should be named according to postural elements, and the functional category referred to as Partner Attack Inhibition (PAI).</page><page sequence="134">776 VOLUME 104 Behaviour Vol. 104 (1988) pp. 1-28 SONG SHARING IN A GROUP-LIVING SONGBIRD, THE AUSTRALIAN MAGPIE, GYMNORHINA TIBICEN.

VELTMAN Department of Botany and Zoology, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand In this study we investigate the role of song in the social behavior of a cooperatively living songbird, the Australian magpie, Gymnorhina tibicen (Cracticidae). In this species, kin and nonkin cooperative groups exist in the same population. We sampled the vocal repertoires of 23 magpies in six territorial groups and the nonterritorial flock, and of a tame magpie. Our results include: 1. Description of song. Soft warble syllables and loud carol syllables compose magpie songs, sung in communal choruses in both territorial and nonterritorial contexts. Warble syllables are diverse in physical structure. 2. Song repertoires. Most songs are individual-specific, though some are shared. Song variants could be found within the repertoire of a given individual, produced by various means (e.g., recombining segments). 3. Syllable repertoires. We classified 893 syllable types from our study population; 67% were individual- specific, and few were shared by more than two to five birds. 4. Repertoire sharing in groups. We found the average percentage of the repertoire shared between all pairwise combinations of birds higher (p &amp;lt; 0.05, Mann-Whitney rank sum test) for birds within vs across social groups. This result was validated (p &amp;lt; 0.05) by 190 Monte Carlo iterations of our procedure. There was no difference in the degree of sharing within presumed kin vs nonkin groups (p &gt; 0.05, Mann-Whitney rank sum test). 5. Syllable sharing and vocal imitation in a tame magpie. A handreared bird had a repertoire consisting in whistles: some were perfect copies of human whistles, and some were improvisations on the same themes.

We discuss vocal imitation and improvisation as major processes in vocal learning; song sharing as a possible badge of recognition for groups; and the function of song in social cohesion. Behaviour Vol. 104 (1988) pp. 29-40 GROUP VIGILANCE AND SHOAL SIZE IN A SMALL CHARACIN FISH J.-G.J. GODIN, L.J. CLASSON and M.V. ABRAHAMS Department of Biology, Mount Allison University, Sackville, N.B., Canada EOA 3CO The relationship between shoal size and group vigilance was investigated in the laboratory using a strongly schooling characin fish, the glowlight tetra (Hemigrammus erythrozonus). Group vigilance, as measured by the probability that at least one fish in the group detected (i.e. exhibited a startle response to) a brief, artificial alarm stimulus, increased curvilinearly at a decelerating rate with increasing shoal size. This would be predicted by the proposed early predator warning function of social groups. The observed relationship between corporate vigilance and shoal size was similar in form to one predicted by a simple signal detection model. However, observed detection probabilities for shoal sizes above 7 fish were lower than expected on the basis of this model, suggesting that an individual's probability of detection was not always independent of shoal size nor of the probabilities of detection of other shoal members. The numbers of tetras in a shoal exhibiting a startle response to an alarm stimulus increased non-linearly with increasing shoal size and exceeded the values predicted by the above mentioned model for the larger shoals, which implies social transmission of the alarm response among shoal members. The importance of the enhanced predator detection ability of fish shoals and the social transmission of alarms within them is discussed in relation to predator avoidance behaviour and other activities of fish in shoals.</page><page sequence="135">VOLUME 104 777 Behaviour Vol. 104 (1988) pp.41-59 RANK MAINTENANCE IN FEMALE JAPANESE MACAQUES: EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE FOR SOCIAL DEPENDENCY BERNARD CHAPAIS Departement d'Anthropologie, Universit6 de Montreal, C.P. 6128, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3C 3J7 In many species of cercopithecines characterized by a matrilineal dominance system, a female inherits her mother's rank (genealogical rank) and there is no correlation between a female's genealogical rank and her physical strength. This paper explores the determinants of rank maintenance and rank stability in such systems. Theoretically, a female might be in need of allies to maintain her rank because (1) she could be challenged by single larger females in dyadic agonistic interactions, and/or (2) she could be challenged by smaller or same-size females acting together (rebellious coalitions). A series of experiments designed to test these two possibilities were carried out in a captive group of Japanese macaques (N - 17) comprised of three families with similar age-sex compositions. Experimental subgroups of females were formed to test the capacity of a single female (i.e. with none of her relatives present) to maintain her rank above genealogically subordinate females (G-Subordinate females) in four social situations: (a) with same-age G-Subordinate females; (b) with a single, older G-Subordinate female, (c) with a group of G-Subordinate sisters, and (d) with a complete G-Subordinate family. Sixty seven experimental subgroups were formed, and 45% of these induced genealogical rank reversals. Low-ranking females appeared to be conditional opportunists who competed for rank only in situations where they clearly had more relative power than the single G-Dominant female (minimal risk strategy). In the experimental subgroups where a G-subordinate female was by herself (no kin present: situations a and b above), she challenged a single G-Dominant female only if the latter was younger and smaller than herself, and she did so only if the G-Dominant female was immature (&lt; 3). Thus, single G-subordinate females did not challenge single same-age G-Dominant females nor did they even challenge single younger G-Dominant females if the latter were mature. In contrast, in the experimental subgroups comprised of a G-Subordinate kin group (situations c and d above), G-Subordinate females could challenge collectively, and outrank, single G-Dominant females, regardless of the latter's age (size). One important implication of these findings is that any female, regardless of her age, is dependent on allies (sensu KAWAI, 1965) to maintain her rank. Thus the hierarchy's stability in matrilineal dominance systems would reflect the existence of inter-individual differences in alliance power, such that for any dyad the G-Dominant female has more collective power than the G-Subordinate female. Two categories of mechanisms are discussed in this context. Stability might result from the dynamics of intra-familial alliances (power asymmetry or power equality among kin-based coalitions) and/or from the dynamics of inter-familial alliances (asymmetry of inter-familial dependence). Behaviour Vol. 104 (1988) pp. 60-77 CHOICE OF INDIVIDUAL FLOWERS BY BUMBLE BEES: INTERACTION OF MORPHOLOGY, TIME AND ENERGY LAWRENCE D. HARDER Department of Zoology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada The purpose of this study was to describe the energetic mechanism underlying the choice of individual flowers of a single plant species by bumble bees. Conditions associated with selective behaviour were detected by following freely foraging bees and collecting flowers that they visited. Two types of selectivity were observed in four of thirteen groups of ten to fifteen bees: a preference for larger than average flowers when all flowers of a particular species were shallower than the lengths of the bees' glossae (_ tongues); or a positive correlation between glossa length and the depth of flowers visited when glossa length approximately equalled flower depth. To explain these results an energetic model was developed based jointly on the dependence of a bee's probing time on glossa length and flower depth, and a positive correlation between flower depth and nectar production. This model was tested by an experiment with different-sized artificial flowers which contained volumes of sugar solution in direct relation to flower size. Because all flowers were shallower than the glossa lengths of the tested bees, a preference for the largest flowers was expected. Over a series of trials three of four bees fed in the expected pattern. Selective behaviour was reflected in very different patterns of size-related flower visitation, which depended on the particular characteristics of both bees and flowers.</page><page sequence="136">778 VOLUME 104 Behaviour Vol. 104 (1988) pp. 78-104 VOCALISATIONS OF THE CHILLINGHAM CATTLE S.J.G. HALL Research Group in Mammalian Ecology and Reproduction, Physiological Laboratory, Downing Street, Cambridge CB2 3EG, England MARGARETA A. VINCE and ELIZABETH SHILLITO WALSER AFRC Institute of Animal Physiology, Babraham, Cambridge CB2 4AT, England P.J. GARSON Department of Zoology, University of Newcastle, Newcastle upon Tyne NEI 7RU, England Chillingham cattle live, free of predation and subject to minimal human interference, in a park in northern England. Bulls live in pairs or trios in shared home ranges. Breeding is not seasonal. Sonagraphic analysis of vocalisations made by bulls enabled the two major components-calls and lows-of their vocal repertoire to be described. Lows were of two categories: 'Type 1' with a main peak of energy at 175 Hz and one harmonic, and 'Type 2' with a main peak at 220 Hz, and seven harmonics. On many occasions, a low of Type 1 changed to Type 2 without interruption. A preponderance of Type 2 in the repertoire of an individual bull is probably associated with high social status. Each call comprised a series of hoots; mean number per call might also serve to distinguish individuals. Bulls vocalised in response to the vocalisations of other bulls, particularly to those of their home range partners. Generally, the more hoots in a preceding call, the more hoots in the response. The call of the Chillingham bulls is unlike any of the vocalisations of races of Bos taurus described in the literature. Its ontogeny probably involves practice and competition with peers, on the part of juvenile bulls. The reason why other Bovini are relatively silent, or possess as adults simple calls developed from those of calves, may be due to the lack of opportunity for juveniles to practise their vocalisations. This might be due to predation pressure or, possibly, in seasonal breeding species, to aggression from mature males. Behaviour Vol. 104 (1988) pp. 105-125 SONG SHARING IN A GROUP-LIVING SONGBIRD, THE AUSTRALIAN MAGPIE. PART II. VOCAL SHARING BETWEEN TERRITORIAL NEIGHBORS, WITHIN AND BETWEEN GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS, AND BETWEEN SEXES SUSAN M. FARABAUGH, ELEANOR D. BROWN and CLARE J. VELTMAN Department of Psychology, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742, U.S.A., and Department of Botany and Zoology, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand In this study we investigate the role of song in the social behavior of a cooperatively living songbird, the Australian magpie, Gymnorhina ticbicen (Cracticidae). In this species, kin and nonkin cooperative territorial groups exist in the same population. We sampled the vocal repertoire of 23 magpies in six territorial groups and the nonterritorial flock. Groups were located on two farms 2-3 km apart. This paper is the second of a two part paper. In Part I, we described song, and song and syllable repertoires; and we compared song sharing within and among kin and nonkin groups. Our results in Part II include: 1. Local geographic patterns in repertoire sharing. We found the average percentage of the repertoire shared between all pairwise combinations of birds to be lowest for birds in different localities, intermediate for birds in the same locality who are not neighbors, and highest for birds who are group mates or neighbors (p &amp;lt; 0.05, Mann-Whitney rank sum test). This result was validated by 500 Monte Carlo iterations of our procedure. Syllables shared by birds in the same group or in the same locality were significantly (p &amp;lt; 0.001, G test of association) more complex than those shared between localities. 2. Sexual patterns in repertoire sharing. The more birds that share a syllable the more likely that it is shared by both males and females. Only six percent of all shared syllables were shared exclusively by more than two birds of the same sex. The average percentage of the syllable repertoire shared by birds of the same sex was not significantly higher (p &gt; 0.79, Mann-Whitney rank sum test) than by birds of the opposite sex, when all birds of known sex were considered. However, when we considered sharing by group mates or neighbors only, birds did share a significantly (p &amp;lt; 0.008) larger percentage of their repertoire with birds of the same sex than with birds of the opposite sex. 3. Sources of vocal imitation. To determine the sources of imitation, we calculated the proportion of a focal bird's repertoire that is shared with different social classes of birds. Birds share more syllables</page><page sequence="137">VOLUME 104 779 exclusively with group mates than with neighbors, and they share more complex syllables with group mates than with other birds (p &amp;lt; 0.001, G test of association). From these data, we discuss the role of vocal imitation in song learning, the timing and social setting of vocal learning, and the territorial functions of song. We conclude that vocal sharing through imitation may function in social affiliation within the group and in territorial defense between groups. Behaviour Vol. 104 (1988) pp. 126-151 DEVELOPPEMENT DES REPONSES PARENTALES CHEZ GALLUS DOMESTICUS: EFFET DE L'AGE ET DU SEXE M.A. RICHARD-YRIS, G. LEBOUCHER, H. GRILLOU et J.P. RICHARD Laboratoire d'Ethologie, UA 373 CNRS, Universite de Rennes I, Campus de Beaulieu, 35042 Rennes Cedex, France The influence of continuous exposure to chicks on the emergence of parental responses (physical contact and maternal call: clucks and food calls) was studied in 8, 17, 24 and 35 week old cockerels and hens. Before sexual maturity (i.e. at 8 and 17 weeks) a parental-filial bond emerged rapidly whether the "parent" was male or female. Older animals were less likely to present rapid onset of maternal responses. Two reasons may account for these discrepancies: (i) Laying hens displayed aggressive behaviour towards chicks (pecks); aggression was observed in 40% of the 24 week old females and in 100% of the 35 week old ones. (ii) Males did not display typical aggressive responses; however, as they grew older, cockerels gradually presented more damaging acts, such as stamping and copulatory attempts towards the young. These behaviours were particularly frequent in sexually mature males. The quality of parental responses (such as the occurrence of physical contact with chicks and the importance of clucking in relation to all the vocal responses) displayed by 24 and 35 weeks old maternal females appeared superior to that displayed by 8 and 17 week old ones. In addition, hens performed more complete parental responses then cockerels did. Behaviour Vol. 104 (1988) pp. 152-161 THE STRUCTURE OF GRASSHOPPER SONG IN RELATION TO MATING SUCCESS R.K. BUTLIN and G.M. HEWITT School of Biological Sciences, University of East Anglia, Norwich, NR4 7TJ, U.K. Males of the gomphocerine grasshopper Chorthippus brunneus produce a conspicuous calling song con- sisting of groups of echemes each composed of syllables. Males with intermediate mean syllable lengths have higher mating success than extreme males. The songs of 21 males previously ranked for mating success have been further analysed using fourier transform analysis of sound envelopes. This analysis confirms the importance of intermediate syllable length and indicates other characters of behavioural sig- nifiance. In particular, a previously undescribed grouping of syllables into triplets is associated with high mating success. This demonstrates that female grasshoppers are sensitive to quite complex features of amplitude modulation in male songs. The technique of fourier transform analysis of sound envelopes has considerable potential in the study of acoustic signals.

GORDON Museum of Comparative Zoology and Society of Fellows, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138, U.S.A. This study investigates how fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) colonies explore and patrol a new region. Small platforms were introduced into nest boxes of laboratory colonies. The paths of ants walking on the platforms were filmed at 30 min after the platforms were introduced, and at 3 75-min intervals thereafter. The results showed: 1. There are four distinct path types used by patrollers in the new region. The different types vary with respect to speed, number of antennal contacts, and the extent to which paths maintain a single direction. 2. Head widths of individuals differ significantly according to path type.</page><page sequence="138">780 VOLUME 104 3. In the course of several hours after the new region is introduced, there is a temporal pattern in the numbers of paths of each type. 4. Removal experiments suggest that temporal patterns in the numbers performing one path type, depend on numbers previously performing other path types. 5. The behavior of individuals exploring a new region is constrained by colony-level patterns of behavior. Behaviour Vol. 104 (1988) pp. 176-188 VERVET MONKEY GRANDMOTHERS: EFFECTS ON MOTHER-INFANT RELATIONSHIPS LYNN A. FAIRBANKS Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90024, U.S.A. Mother-infant behaviour among captive socially-living vervet monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops sabaeus) was studied throughout the first six months of the infants' live for 21 dyads with maternal grandmothers present in the group and 15 dyads without grandmothers. The presence of a grandmother significantly influenced the mother-infant relationship. In dyads with grandmothers, mothers were less protective: they spent less time in contact with their infants, were less restrictive of their infant's movements, and played a lesser role in establishing and maintaining contact, compared to dyads without grandmothers. Infants with grandmothers were more independent: they spent more time away from their mothers (beyond 1 meter) and actively approached and left their mothers at an earlier age, compared to infants without grandmothers. These results demonstrate that grandmothers have an important and continuing effect on their adult daugh- ter's behavior and reproduction. Behaviour Vol. 104 (1988) pp. 189-201 BEYOND THE ONE-MALE GROUP T.E. ROWELL Department of Zoology, University of California at Berkeley, CA 94720 U.S.A. Social systems are not necessarily equivalent to mating systems. Observation is prerequisite for control of one animal by another. It is not possible without extremely good visibility, which is rare. Nonetheless most social theories assume such control. Neither social position nor copulation guarantee paternity. It is important that biochemical tests provide certainly of paternity in as many studies as possible, so that assumptions about behavioural determinants of reproductive success can be tested. The function of fighting is discussed. Males spend more of their time cooperating than competing, and it is suggested that differences between these may not be so clear. To understand the behaviour of adult males it is necessary to consider behaviour throughout lifetimes, behaviour in all seasons, and behaviour throughout demes. Scepticism towards facile explanations is recommended. Behaviour Vol. 104 (1988) pp. 202-232 DEMOGRAPHY AND GROUP STRUCTURE IN WEDGE-CAPPED CAPUCHIN MONKEYS, CEBUS OLIVACEUS JOHN G. ROBINSON Department of Wildlife and Range Sciences, School of Forest Resources and Conservation, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida 32611, U.S.A. The extent to which population demography determines the age and sex composition of primate groups was examined using data from a population of wedge-capped capuchin monkeys Cebus olivaceus in central Venezuela. Demographic parameters were derived from censuses of individually recognized, aged, and sexed individuals living in nine groups over a ten year period. Animals were aged by extrapolation from census data. Animals of both sexes were classed as infants during their first year, and juveniles until they reached six years of age. Females reach sexual maturity at this time, while males were classed as subadults until they reached full adult size at age 12. Adulthood lasts at least 30 years in females, at least 24 years in males. Age-sex class specific mortality and fecundity rates generated a life table</page><page sequence="139">VOLUME 104 which indicated that the population was increasing (r = 0.087) between 1977 and 1986. The age and sex composition of the nine groups was described annually. On average, non-adults made up 60% of a group, with this percentage increasing with group size. There were more females than males in all groups in all years. The strong female-biased adult sex ratio (1:4.4) was a consequence of a biased birth sex ratio (1:1.9), higher female than male survivorship especially between the ages of 3 and 7 when males were dispersing, and a pronounced sexual bimaturism. The stable age distribution derived from the life table successfully predicted the observed average distribution of age-sex categories in groups. This suggests that the group structure of Cebus olivaceus groups is not a consequence of intragroup social interactions, but results from demographic parameters. Behaviour Vol. 104 (1988) pp. 233-261 REPRODUCTIVE BEHAVIOUR OF SOUTHERN SEA LIONS CLAUDIO CAMPAGNA and BURNEY J. LE BOEUF Institute of Marine Sciences and Department of Biology, University of California, Santa Cruz, CA 95064, U.S.A. and Centro Nacional Patag6nico, Puerto Madryn, Argentina The reproductive behaviour of individually marked sourthern sea lions, Otaria byronia, was studied from 1981 to 1986, at Punta Norte, Peninsula Valdes, Argentina. Males defended territories along the high water mark early in the breeding season but switched to female defence as they were joined by females. Males defended females from neighbours and intruders, and forcefully held pre-oestrus females near them. Males defended territories and females against neighbours and intruders with threat displays and by fighting. Males never strayed far from females. The frequency of aggressive interactions among males was positively correlated with the number of females in oestrus. A mean of 2.8 females was associated with each male in the central breeding area at peak season, with some males being associated with 8-16 females for a few hours. Ninety four percent of the males that held a territory for five or more days copulated. Copulations were not observed away from territories in the central breeding area. Mating success was positively correlated with tenure on territory. The first males to arrive had the longest tenures and achieved the most copulations. Mean tenure on territory was 24 days (range = 15-57 days). The mean number of observed copulations per marked adult male was 3.87 ± 3.31. Variance among breeding males was low; the most successful male achieved only 7% of the copulations observed. Females gave birth a mean of 3.3 days after arrival, copulated once six days later and then went to sea to feed 7.6 days after parturition. Thereafter, females alternated periods of feeding at sea (X = 2.8 days) with periods of nursing their pups (X = 2.3 days). Males sequester pre-oestrous females. This mating strategy leads to differences in behaviour between Otaria and males of other sea lion species. These differences are evident in harem size, time away from females (as manifested by brief and infrequent fighting), the high percentage of males breeding, and the low variance in mating success among breeding males. Behaviour Vol. 104 (1988) pp. 262-280 PROVISIONING BEHAVIOUR IN A COMMUNAL BREEDER: AN EPIGENETIC APPROACH TO THE STUDY OF INDIVIDUAL VARIATION IN BEHAVIOUR IAN G. JAMIESON Department of Zoology, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand This study used an epigenetic approach to examine the development of individual variation in provisioning behaviour in a communally breeding bird, the pukeko. Breeders who are initially 'exposed' to chicks during incubation were the first to brood and provision newly hatched chicks. From the first week after hatching until midway through the provisioning period, there was no significant difference in the percentage of time spent provisioning by breeders and non-breeders suggesting that the maintenance of provisioning is not dependent on increases in hormone levels attained through breeding or incubation, but on stimulations that arise through contact with the chicks. Breeders reduced and eventually stopped provisioning chicks midway through the provisioning period in association with the laying of a second clutch. Social learning, imitation and the 'priming' effect of other behaviours appeared to influence the onset of provisioning in inexperienced or naive juvenile and yearling pukeko. Inexperienced birds initially 781</page><page sequence="140">782 VOLUME 104 exhibited a heightened response toward hatchlings which appears to be the result of some sort of novelty effect. Inexperienced yearlings, however, did not provision for as long into the season as experienced non-breeders unless the latter were not present in the group or had stopped provisioning earlier in the season. It is proposed that factors giving rise to and maintaining behavioural asymmetries can best be understood from an epigenetic perspective. Behaviour Vol. 104 (1988) pp. 281-299 SONG TUTOR CHOICE IN ZEBRA FINCHES AND BENGALESE FINCHES: THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF VISUAL AND VOCAL CUES N.S. CLAYTON Dept. Zoology and Marine Biology, University of St. Andrews, Fife, Scotland This paper examined the relative importance of visual and vocal cues for song tutor choice. In the first study zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, and Bengalese finches, Lonchura striata, were hosed with two song tutors at independence, a zebra finch singing Bengalese finch song and a Bengalese finch singing zebra finch song. All the males tended to learn from the conspecific song tutor, irrespective of whether they had been raised by a pair of conspecifics, the female alone or cross-fostered to a pair of the other species. In the second study zebra finches were housed at independence with two conspecific song tutors, one with a normal song and one which sang Bengalese finch song elements. There was no tendency to learn zebra finch elements which suggests that species-specific elements are not important for song tutor choice in zebra finches. Other vocal differences between the tutors such as length of the song phrase and species-specific call notes might bias learning in favour of the conspecific. Visual differences between the two species, both in appearance and behaviour, seem to be important. Parental cues before independence appear to be relatively uninfluential. However, siblings may be important, both the species and number per clutch: this is a factor which has been overlooked in previous studies of song learning. Behaviour Vol. 104 (1988) pp. 300-319 DOMINANCE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ADULT PLAINS ZEBRA STALLIONS IN SEMI-CAPTIVITY MATTHIJS B.H. SCHILDER Laboratory for Comparative Physiology, University of Utrecht, Jan van Galenstraat 40, 3572 LA Utrecht, The Netherlands The relationships between 4-5 adult zebra stallions, living in a safari park, were investigated over a period of 5 years. Asymmetries in the distributions of a number of behaviours could be explained by adopting dominance as an intervening variable. Dominance in stallions was of a bipolar nature with on the one hand behaviours representing subordinance and defence, and on the other hand behaviours reinforcing and confirming dominance. Expression of formal dominance seems to play a minor role. The dyadic relationships of stallions differed as to the number of behaviours reflecting dominance relationships. Although often linear rank-orders could be constructed, these rank-orders were not necessarily identical. This means that the concept of dominance is of only limited value for describing relationships between zebra stallions.</page><page sequence="141">VOLUME 105 783 Behaviour Vol. 105 (1988) pp. 1-17 INTRA-SPECIFIC FOOD COMPETITION AND PRIMATE SOCIAL STRUCTURE: A SYNTHESIS CHARLES H. JANSON Department of Ecology and Evolution, State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY 11794, U.S.A. The results of the various studies in this volume lead to a series of predictions about the relationships of group size to various components of food intake. Individuals in larger groups should generally encounter fewer new food sources per unit foraging effort than they would alone (prediction 1); an exception may occur when large groups defend areas of high food density against small groups. In addition, individuals in larger groups generally will suffer reduced intake per food source encountered because of increased sharing with other group members, at least for food sources that supply little total nutrient relative to an individual's satiation level for the nutrient (prediction 3) or are scarce relative to the spacing between individuals in the group (prediction 5). Individuals in larger groups may compensate for such reductions in foraging efficiency by increasing rates of food encounter (prediction 2), using food sources with greater amounts of nutrient (prediction 4), or increasing total foraging effort per day (prediction 6). Reduced foraging efficiency for a particular nutrient may not affect total intake of that nutrient if other nutrients require greater daily foraging effort (prediction 7). Food competition is expected to be highest in species using small and scarce food sources, subject to a high risk of predation, and with large satiation levels. An appendix on statistical problems describes some of the pitfalls inherent in studies of the kind presented in this volume. Behaviour Vol. 105 (1988) pp. 18-34 DIET, FORAGING PATTERNS, AND RESOURCE DEFENSE IN A MIXED SPECIES TROOP OF SAGUINUS MYSTAX AND SAGUINUS FUSCICOLLIS IN AMAZONIAN PERU PAUL A. GARBER Department of Anthropology, University of Illinois, Urbana, I11. 61801, U.S.A. In the Amazon Basin of northeastern Peru, moustached (Saguinus mystax) and saddle-back (S. fuscicollis) tamarins form stable mixed species assemblages in which groups of each species feed, forage, rest, travel and cooperatively defend a territory throughout the entire year. Data presented indicate that despite extreme overlap in feeding and ranging behavior, a change in troop size did not have a significant affect on dietary preferences, activity budgets, day range, foraging effort, and the number and length of daily feeding bouts of either resident species. The larger troop, however, was more successful at defending major feeding trees than the smaller troop. Unsuccessful resource defense resulted in a decrease in time spent feeding and foraging, and an increase in the distance traveled to the next major feeding site. It is proposed that within-troop feeding competition is generally not a critical factor in the feeding ecology of this mixed species tamarin troop. Rather, the formation of such a troop enables each resident species to more effectively exploit and defend a set of productive feeding trees. Behaviour Vol. 105 (1988) pp. 35-52 EFFECTS OF PATCH QUALITY AND FEEDING SUBGROUP SIZE ON FEEDING SUCCESS IN VERVET MONKEYS (CERCOPITHECUS AETHIOPS) P.L. WHITTEN Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT. 06510, U.S.A. Acacia tortilis flowers are an important food resource of vervet monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops) in East Africa. This paper examines the effects of tortilis patch quality and feeding subgroup size on individual and group foraging success in vervet monkeys. Feeding variables examined included net caloric gain, foraging efficiency, pick rates, and foraging bout length. The data provide some evidence in support of the hypothesis that patch quality significantly influences foraging success. Patches were flower pick rates were higher provided foraging for a greater proportion of the troop and provided more energy intake and higher foraging efficiency for individual troop members. Phenological data indicate that flower pick rates were a direct reflection of patch size and flower cover. On the other hand, data examined here provide no support for the hypothesis that feeding subgroup size adversely affects food intake or foraging efficiency within food patches. The lack of foraging costs</page><page sequence="142">784 VOLUME 105 appears to be due to adjustment of feeding parties to the size of food patches. Troop size, however, exceeded the average number of feeding sites per A. tortilis patch. As a consequence, low-ranking troop members suffered foraging costs due to exclusion from food patches. These analyses suggest that individual differences in benefits and costs of group foraging may play an important role in the history and evolution of groups. Behaviour Vol. 105 (1988) pp. 53-76 FOOD COMPETITION IN BROWN CAPUCHIN MONKEYS (CEBUS APELLA): QUANTITATIVE EFFECTS OF GROUP SIZE AND TREE PRODUCTIVITY CHARLES H. JANSON Department of Ecology and Evolution, State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY 11794, U.S.A. The effects of group size and fruit availability in tree crowns on per-capita food intake was examined for wild brown capuchin monkeys living in groups of 3-12 individuals. Per-capita feeding time was nearly exactly inversely proportional to group size in small-crowned trees with little fruit, but was essentially independent of group size in large-crowned trees with abundant fruit. Despite the use of such productive trees, per-capita feeding time in the average tree visited decreased by 50% over a 4-fold range of group sizes. This cost of indirect food competition in large groups was not compensated by increased rates of ingestion, preferential use of large trees, of a higher rate of fruit tree encounter per distance travelled. Instead, foraging effort (distance travelled, number of minutes devoted to foraging, total activity minutes per day) increased at large group sizes. Estimates of total energy intake and expenditure suggest that net energy gain is constant for individuals in group sizes of 5-12. I suggest that the upper limit to group size is set by the daylength available for foraging in large groups. Aggression in food trees increased in frequency in larger groups, but the relative feeding rates of dominants and subordinates of a given rank did not appear to depend on group size. Observed decreases in per-capita food intake due to either indirect or aggressive food competition within large groups are substantially greater than the 4% gain in mean food intake that large groups achieve by displacing smaller groups from fruit trees. Behaviour Vol. 105 (1988) pp. 77-98 SCRAMBLE AND CONTEST IN FEEDING COMPETITION AMONG FEMALE LONG-TAILED MACAQUES (MACACA FASCICULARIS) CAREL P. VAN SCHAIK and MARIA A. VAN NOORDWIJK Laboratory of Comparative Physiology, University of Utrecht, Jan van Galenstraat 40, 3572 LA Utrecht, The Netherlands Most previous studies of feeding competition in gregarious primates compared some average or group- level characteristic over a range of group sizes. Here an attempt is made to separate the effects of within-group scramble (the "group size" effect) and of within-group contest (the "dominance" effect) on energy expenditure and food intake in female long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis). Significant or consistent scramble and contest components were demonstrated for locomotion and energy expenditure, for the presence in the main party of the group, and for birth rate. The intake of fruit or animal matter was not increased in compensation, but the intake of dispersed vegetable matter probably was. It is concluded that both components of feeding competition exist in long-tailed macaques, but that contest for food is often transferred into contest for safety. A framework is proposed to relate interspecific variation in contest effects to food distribution and group cohesion.

Canada T6G 2E1 Patch depletion is an assumption that underlies many behavioural ecological models, yet it has rarely been examined. The evidence presented here suggests that the spider and howling monkeys of Santa Rosa National Park, Costa Rica use food resources that occur in patches and generally deplete the patches they use. However, some types of patches (e.g. large fruiting trees for spider monkeys, and trees used as sources of leaves for howlers) are not depleted by the feeding activity of primates. An examination of</page><page sequence="143">VOLUME 105 785 which types of patches are depleted and the manner in which depletion likely occurs, allows an assessment of possible factors underlying the different types of social organizations in these species. Behaviour Vol. 105 (1988) pp. 117-134 FOOD COMPETITION AND FORAGING PARTY SIZE IN THE BLACK SPIDER MONKEY (ATELES PANISCUS CHAMEK) M. McFARLAND SYMINGTON Department of Biology, Princeton University, U.S.A. In Ateles, individuals forage for fruit in subgroups of unstable membership. The size and composition of these foraging parties are highly variable. Data from my long-term field study of a population of black spider monkeys in Peru show a strong positive correlation between the average size of these parties and the number and size of trees currently producing fruit in the environment. This correlation appears to be driven by intragroup feeding competition, since individuals in larger parties showed substantially lowered feeding efficiencies, as measured by increased daily ranges and decreased time spent feeding. Patch size and patch density, which jointly determine fruit abundance, interact to determine foraging party size, apparently by the following mechanism. The number of spider monkeys that can feed within a particular patch is limited by the size of that patch. When patches are close together (i.e. high patch density) individuals in excess of this limit are able to feed in nearby patches and thus maintain contact with the other members of their foraging party. When patch density is low, the increased travel costs associated with such a strategy become prohibitive and foraging parties are smaller than or equal to the number of individuals able to feed within a single patch. Females that are routinely excluded from the best feeding sites may have reduced reproductive success because of their low priority of access to resources. These data provide a quantitative link between two ecological variables (resource patch size and density) and fission-fusion social organization in the spider monkey.

Box 7062, Kampala, Uganda Competition for fruit within chimpanzee foraging parties was investigated by testing the hypotheses that food patch size was a limiting factor to foraging party size to foraging efficiency while chimpanzees were foraging in Pseudospondias microcarpa trees for fruit. Large food patches (as measured by phenological score or the product of diameter at breast height and phenological score) supported significantly larger parties than did smaller food patches. In addition, foraging efficiency was apparently higher for small parties than for large ones, although the difference was marginally statistically significant. Per-capita feeding time for individuals in small parties was significantly higher than for those in large parties when chimpanzees had access to both Pseudospondias and Uvariopsis congensis fruit trees. Per-capita feeding time was not significantly correlated with food patch size. When Uvariopsis fruit trees became exhausted in mid-August, some chimpanzees apparently avoided severe competition for fruit by leaving the C.C. area, where they had been feeding on both Uvariopsis and Pseudospondias fruit. Social factors did not significantly affect foraging party size nor per-capita feeding time.

The relative importance of feeding competition in Pan paniscus and Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii is examined in an attempt to understand the major differences in social organization of the two species. P. paniscus at Lomako is characterized by a stronger tendency for association among females than among</page><page sequence="144">786 VOLUME 105 female P troglodytes at Gombe. Party size in P paniscus is dependent on patch size. Feeding competition was more important in small patches than in large patches. The total amount of feeding time by a party in a patch (chimp-minutes) was a measure of patch size that was available for both chimpanzee species. P. paniscus was found to have larger party sizes and to use larger food patches than P troglodytes. The importance of dispersed ground foods for each species of chimpanzee was compared and, although the results are not conclusive, they indicate that this type of food was equally important in the diets of both populations. Two hypotheses of the ecological basis for differences in social structure are compared in light of this evidence.

HAUSER Department of Anthropology, University of California, Los Angeles, Calif., 90024, U.S.A. and Institute of Primate Research, National Museums of Kenya, Nairobi, Kenya Natural observations and field playback experiments were conducted on five groups of free-ranging vervet monkeys to determine when infants recognize the alarm calls of starlings as general alerting signals. Results show that infants do not recognize starling alarm calls at birth. Recognition of starling calls emerges gradually and age at recognition is affected by differences in auditory environment. Infants who have heard starling alarm calls at high rates respond at an earlier age than infants who hear calls at low rates. More importantly, in those groups where infants respond at an earlier age, starlings give alarm calls to vervet predators more often than to non-vervet predators. Thus in the former groups, when adults respond to starling alarm calls, their behavior is more positively reinforcing than in the other groups where starling alarm calls are commonly given to non-vervet predators. Behaviour Vol. 105 (1988) pp. 202-223 MATING SYSTEM, MATE CHOICE AND ULTRASONIC CALLING IN A ZAPROCHILINE KATYDID (ORTHOPTERA: TETTIGONIIDAE) DARRYL T. GWYNNE and WINSTON J. BAILEY Department of Zoology, University of Western Australia, Nedlands, Western Australia 6009 We describe sexual communication and the mating system of an undescribed genus of zaprochiline katydid. Males produce an ultrasonic calling song described as a series of simple pulses as a carrier frequency near 50 kHz. Zaprochilines contrast with most other katydids in having a narrow diet consisting of pollen. Males in nature exhibited a resource-defence mating system by calling in choruses near flowers which were attractive to females. We determined whether females discriminated among calling males as mates. An early-season sample of male calls showed a correlation between song frequency and both body size and the size of the glands that produce a large, nutritious spermatophore which is eaten by the female. The prediction that larger males would have a mating advantage over small individuals was supported in laboratory experiments. However, examination of paired males in nature failed to reveal any evidence of such a mating advantage. Furthermore, in other laboratory experiments it was found that females preferred high frequency call models, representative of small males, over low frequency calls. It is suggested that females do not prefer calls of large males because only in the early part of the season does male song give information on the size of the male and his spermatophore glands. In addition, spermatophore nutrients</page><page sequence="145">VOLUME 105 787 may be less important to the nutrition of female zaprochiline than other katydiyds, due to the high-protein pollen diet of this species. Since higher frequencies of calls show relatively greater attenuation with distance, the high frequency calls preferred by females may be perceived as males calling closeby. Behaviour Vol. 105 (1988) pp. 224-249 GROUP RAIDS: A MATING STRATEGY OF MALE SOUTHERN SEA LIONS CLAUDIO CAMPAGNA, BURNEY J. LE BOEUF and HUMBERTO L. CAPPOZZO Institute for Marine Sciences and Department of Biology, University of California, Santa Cruz, 95064, U.S.A. Southern sea lions, Otaria byronia, breed in a narrow zone along the high tide mark where males sequester females, defending them against competitors that congregate on the periphery. During four breeding seasons, 15 December to 10 February, 1983-1986, we observed marked animals at Punta Norte, Peninsula Valdes, Argentina, and recorded the form, frequency and consequences of an unusual mating strategy: groups of males raid the breeding area attempting to seize females from resident, territorial males. Raids were often triggered by one male rushing into the breeding area. Females fled from the point of attack and were separated from their pups and were redistributed within the breeding area. Some resident males gained females, others were deposed and lost females while some raiders gained females and residency in the breeding area. A mean of 144 (sd = 22) raids were observed per breeding season, with 57% of them occurring at peak season, 14-26 January. During this period, raids occurred at a rate of one every two hours of observation. Raids occurred at all hours of the day and at night, the rate, time and site of occurrence being associated with the location and number of females in oestrus, and with tide. The mean size of the raiding party was 10 males (sd = 8, range - 2-40 males); 66% of the males were subadults. In 36% of 355 raids, at least one female was seized and held for at least a few minutes; in the remainder, all raiders were repelled. There were three outcomes when a raider seized a female: 1) In 53% of the seizures, the male lost the female in less than one hour and was driven out; 2) in 8% of the seizures, the raider could not withstand the attacks of resident males and herded the females a few metres to the periphery of the breeding area, and 3) in 39% of the seizures, the raider remained in the breeding area with one or more females. Subadult raiders were not successful in securing females but in 18% of 484 raids, they seized a pup. Fifty seven percent of the time, pups were abducted from the breeding area and held forcibly like adult females. At least five of them were killed. Raiders that secured a female during a raid remained in residency a mean of 13 days (sd = 9), a significantly shorter tenure than that of males that set up residence in the breeding area at the start of the season (x = 24 days, sd - 5). Group raids were an effective mating strategy for some participants. The probability of copulating was higher when a male raided the breeding area in a group than when alone. Raiders that seized females and became residents copulated 1.5 times per 100 hrs in the breeding area, achieving a mean of 2.2 copulations per male (variance = 6.0). Founder residents copulated at a similar rate, but were more successful than raider-residents due to longer tenures, achieving a mean of 5.3 copulations per male (variance = 12.3). The incidence and success of raids as a mating strategy was partially dependent on topography. At Puerto Piramide, where males defended territories containing tidepools and access to the breeding area was limited to a few sites at high tide, raids were infrequent and ineffective. Raiders synchronized their rush into the breeding area, keying on the first male to move. However, no alliances or coalitions, suggesting cooperation, were formed. Group raids consist of a collective revolt against the status quo, similar in form to troop takeovers by groups of male hanuman langurs. Outside males can achieve proximity to oestrous females with less risk of injury by raiding in a group rather than by attempting to seize a female by themselves.</page><page sequence="146">788 VOLUME 105 Behaviour Vol. 105 (1988) pp. 250-291 CULTURAL AND GENETIC VARIATION IN SWAMP SPARROWS (MELOSPIZA GEORGIANA) I. SONG VARIATION, GENETIC VARIATION, AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP EVAN BALABAN The Rockefeller University Field Research Center, Tyrrel Road, Millbrook, N.Y. 12545 U.S.A. The relationship between variation in a cultural trait, the songs of male swamp sparrows Melospiza georgiana, and genetic variation at nine polymorphic enzyme loci was examined using seven geographic locations covering a major portion of the breeding range of this species. Swamp sparrow songs exhibit geographical variation, and song populations at a location can remain relatively stable over a ten year period. Three measures of song syllable variation were used to examine the similarities between the song populations. Electrophoretic analysis suggested at least 3 groups of locations based on allelic frequency differences. Two of these groups are geographically extensive. The mean proportion of songs two locations share is related independently to the distance between the locations and to the similarity of their allele frequencies. The allele frequency similarity between two locations is not related to the geographic distance between them. A descriptive analysis of the relationship, between song and genetic variation yielded two conclusions. First, two of the three population subdivisions exhibited a pattern of correlation between song syllable variation and genetic variation that may resemble character displacement. The similarity of song syllables at two locations may depend on the position of the two locations relative to the region where different allele-frequency groups come into contact. Second, this pattern of correlation did not hold for comparisons involving the third subdivision, and thus was not species universal in swamp sparrows. Song syllable variation may have different biological relevance in different geographical areas. Behaviour Vol. 105 (1988) pp. 292-322 CULTURAL AND GENETIC VARIATION IN SWAMP SPARROWS (MELOSPIZA GEORGIANA) II. BEHAVIORAL SALIENCE OF GEOGRAPHIC SONG VARIANTS EVAN BALABAN The Rockefeller University Field Research Center, Tyrrel Road, Millbrook, N.Y. 12545 U.S.A. Swamp sparrow songs are 2-second strings of identical syllables. Each syllable is made up of distinct minimal acoustic units termed notes. Note variation in this species can be described with a small number of species-universal note categories; the temporal arrangement of note categories making up a syllable (called song syntax) varies between natural populations (MARLER &amp; PICKERT, 1984). Part I of this study (BALABAN, 1988) found a correlation between song syllable variation and allele frequency variation in two populations of swamp sparrows. The present study examines the behavioral salience of geographic song variation in these populations. Field playback experiments suggested that geographic song syllable variants have differential salience to adult male birds in populations that differ in gene frequencies, and that song syntax is one feature that determines differential salience in males. Laboratory song preference tests suggested that songs that differ in syntax have differential salience to adult female birds from populations with different gene frequencies. Song syntax appears to be learned by males reared and tutored in the laboratory; and song syntax prefer- ences are either learned at less than 10 days of age or innately expressed in females reared and tutored in the laboratory. Results also suggest that song syntax is not the only feature influencing the differential salience of geo- graphic song variants; there may be subtle variations in note morphology between different populations that are salient to male and female swamp sparrows.</page><page sequence="147">VOLUME 106 789 Behaviour Vol. 106 (1988) pp. 1-24 ACOUSTIC COMMUNICATION IN THE BELTED KINGFISHER: AN EXAMPLE OF TEMPORAL CODING WM JAMES DAVIS The University of Texas at Austin, Dept. of Zoology, Austin, Texas 78712, U.S.A. Associations between call structure and function were examined in vocalizations of Ceryle alcyon. Four structural groups were recognized and message content within each group was inferred from the sender's behaviour and context. Both spectral and temporal properties of calls varied within each group. Notably, temporal patterning of pulses covaried with behaviour: calls comprised of doublet patterns were associated with aggressive behaviour of the sender while calls comprised of evenly spaced pulses were not. A summary of message content for each call group is as follows: 1) scream calls were associated with non-aggressive behaviour such as retreat and defensive threat, 2) harsh calls were used by males during intrasexual disputes and when combined with scream calls to attract females, 3) rattle calls were associated with a broad spectrum of behaviour which also included territorial conflicts, and 4) warbling calls were emitted by females when soliciting copulations. In field experiments, the agonistic response of individuals to playback of natural calls was measured. Responses were stronger to scream calls than to harsh calls. In an experiment using structural variants of rattle calls, levels of response across call variants also differed. Because call structure and behaviour covaried, it is proposed that rattle calls form a graded signalling system useful for mediating territorial confrontations. Behaviour Vol. 106 (1988) pp. 25-42 FILIAL IMPRINTING IN AN ALTRICIAL BIRD: THE BLACKBIRD (TURDUS MERULA) FELIX JUNCO Departamento de Psicologia, Universidad de Oviedo, CNValdes Salas, Oviedo, Asturias, Spain In altricial birds there are studies about sexual imprinting but there is no experimental evidence about filial imprinting. The work reported here was carried out to inquire into this question in the blackbird (Turdus merula). In experiment 1, 40 nestlings were taken from their nests at 6-7 days of age and bred in visual isolation. The chicks were fed by hand in darkness. At different ages (10, 11, 12 and 13 days post-hatching) they were fed by a stuffed blackbird during 10 feeding sessions. Tests giving a choice between the familar model and a novel one were performed 24 and 36 hours after training, and the begging behaviour as well as fear responses were recorded. Only 11 day old trained chicks showed a significant preference towards the familiar model, which seems to support the existence of an optimal period for filial bond construction in this species. In experiment 2 the possibility of a predisposition to the species characteristics was controlled. At the age of 11 days, 16 chicks were fed either with a plush bird (Group P) or with a cardboard bow (Group B). 24 hours after training one testing session was carried out, using a stuffed blackbird as unfamiliar model. Control subjects were tested to determine whether any naive preference existed. Both Group P and Group B showed a significant preference towards the familiar model, whereas control subjects exhibited no preference for either model. These results suggest the existence of only one kind of filial imprinting with similar characteristics in altricial birds and in precocial ones.

LARKIN Institute of Animal Resource Ecology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, B.C., Canada, V6T 1W5 Assortative mating between the anadromous (sockeye salmon) and non-anadromous (kokanee) forms of Oncorhynchus nerka was documented in Pierre Creek, Babine Lake, British Columbia. Sockeye males of</page><page sequence="148">790 VOLUME 106 all sizes mated almost exclusively with sockeye females. Only a small proportion of the smallest sockeye males (jacks) were observed courting kokanee females. Kokanee males either courted kokanee females or acted as sneaks to sockeye pairs. We experimentally tested the hypotheses that assortative mating occurred because of: a) male intrasexual competition for the largest (sockeye) females; b) male choice dependent on male size; and c) male choice dependent on form. Our results demonstrated male competition was not the cause of assortative mating as has previously been suggested. Kokanee males only preferred sockeye over kokanee females when direct access to kokanee females was denied. Male choice was dependent on male size as has previously been demonstrated within kokanee, but appeared to also involve a form component. Kokanee males preferred kokanee females over the much larger and fecund sockeye females. The evolution of assortative mating between sockeye and kokanee fits models of sympatric speciation. An initial degree of assortative mating between forms is predicted by their environmentally induced great size difference. This promotes genetic divergence between the forms, which has been documented, accompanied by the evolution of premating isolating mechanisms. However, behavioural divergence is not complete in Pierre Creek. Kokanee males restricted from direct access to kokanee females prefer to sneak on sockeye pairs over kokanee pairs. Behaviour Vol. 106 (1988) pp. 63-80 MALE MATE CHOICE DEPENDENT ON MALE SIZE IN SALMON CHRIS J. FOOTE Institute of Animal Resource Ecology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, B.C., Canada, V6T 1W5 Non-anadromous sockeye salmon males (kokanee), Oncorhynchus nerka, were tested to determine if they select mates according to their absolute size (fork length) or if male mate choice was governed by the size of the male. In a series of four experiments, involving three size groups of males and females, the size of females presented and males tested were systematically varied. The results demonstrated male choice is dependent on male size and not solely on the absolute size of females as previously suggested in salmon and other fishes. Males of all sizes discriminated against females smaller than themselves, but did not discriminate between females of their own size and those larger. Thus, male selectivity increases with male size in salmon. The smallest males are the least selective of mates whereas the largest males are the most selective, preferring the largest females. This varying selectivity corresponds to the availability of females on the spawning grounds. Small males have the most limited range of potential mates (because of the effects of size in intrasexual competition and female choice) whereas large males have the widest range in potential mates. The experimental results presented are consistent with two observed patterns of association of male and female salmonids on the spawning grounds: a) the number of males aggregated around females increases with increasing female size; and b) pairing between the sexes is assortative by size. Assortative mating by size was demonstrated to be further increased by male intrasexual competition. These results suggest that intrasexual competition and mate choice by the opposite sex can lead to the evolution of varying strategies of mate choice within sexes, just as it can lead to the evolution of varying strategies of seeking mates. Behaviour Vol. 106 (1988) pp. 81-1 11 LIMITATIONS IN THE ASSESSMENT OF PATH DEPENDENT INFORMATION ARIANE S. ETIENNE, ROLAND MAURER and FRANCIS SAUCY Laboratoire d'Ethologie, FPSE, Universite de Geneve, CH-1211 Geneve 4, Switzerland When hoarding food in an experimental arena (0 = 2.20 m), golden hamsters tend to return along a direct path from the food source at the centre of the arena to their peripherally located nest. Under infra-red light the animals' homing behaviour is exclusively controlled by 'internal' cues which have been generated during the outward journey to the feeding place. The paper examines the limitations on the registration and computation of directional cues which originate from an active or a passive outgoing trip. The compensation of the angular component of the outward journey was examined by inducing the subjects to walk (actively) around the centre of the arena, or by rotating the animals (passively) on a platform which contained the food source. The greater the number of rotations, the less precise the homing performance. After three to five active rotations, and after two to three passive rotations of 3600, the animals ceased to yield significant homing vectors. Unidirectional rotations induced a systematic ipsidirectional bias, an indication of undercompensation; no bias was observed after rotations which occurred in equal extents in both directions.</page><page sequence="149">VOLUME 106 791 Special importance was given to the compensation for passive translations. The experiments involved either the shift of the subjects from their nest exit to an unfamiliar, adjacent arena, or the combination of an active and a passive outward leg during the outward journey to the centre of the animals' own arena. During their return to the nest, either the hamsters did not take into account at all the direction of the passive translation, or if they did, the compensation was only limited. These results are discussed in relation to the animals' capacity to assess 1) an active outward journey through the availability of different categories of self generated cues, and 2) a passive outward journey predominantly on the basis of vestibular signals. A final series of experiments showed that under certain conditions, the hamsters commit systematic homing errors which can be attributed to their failure to initiate the registration and computation of path dependent cues at the right instant in time and space. Behaviour Vol. 106 (1988) pp. 112-118 SEXUAL CANNIBALISM IN THE PRAYING MANTIS HIERODULA MEMBRANACEA T.R. BIRKHEAD, K.E. LEE and P. YOUNG Department of Zoology, The University, Sheffield, S1O 2TN, England We tested the idea that sexual cannibalism increases male and female fecundity in the mantid Hierodula membranacea. Two experiments were performed, in the first we maintained females on one of three nutritional planes; high medium or low. Food intake was positively and significantly associated with: maximum mass attained, the mass of first and subsequent oothecae, and the rate at which oothecae were produced. Ootheca mass was positively correlated with maximum female mass, and the number of young hatching from oothecae was positively correlated with ootheca mass. In the second experiment we maintained females on low diets and allowed some to eat the male during mating and prevented others from doing so. Females which ate the male produced significantly heavier oothecae than those which did not. The female's nutritional state influenced her likelihood of eating the male; well fed females rarely ate males. These results confirm that under certain food regimes male and female fecundity are increased by sexual cannibalism. However, our observations indicate that males do not sacrifice themselves at mating, but attempt to avoid being eaten, suggesting that while sexual cannibalism may be adaptive for females it is unlikely to be so for male H. membranacea. Behaviour Vol. 106 (1988) pp. 119-128 A TEST OF THE COMPETITION HYPOTHESIS OF VOCAL MIMICRY, USING SONG SPARROW IMITATION OF WHITE-CROWNED SPARROW SONG CLIVE K. CATCHPOLE and LUIS F. BAPTISTA Department of Ornithology and Mammalogy, California Academy of Sciences, Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, California, U.S.A. A series of experiments were carried out to determine whether territorial male white-crowned sparrows could discriminate between playback of their own species song (the model) and the same song produced by a song sparrow (the mimic). Males responded strongly to both songs, and there were no significant differences in response measures between model and mimic. In contrast, most males showed no response to control song sparrow song, although two individuals showed clear interspecific responses. The results are discussed in relation to the competition hypothesis of vocal mimicry, which requires both deception of the model by the mimic and some evidence of interspecific aggression. Behaviour Vol. 106 (1988) pp. 129-157 DUETTING, PAIR BONDING AND AGONISTIC DISPLAY IN PARAKEET PAIRS PATRICIA C. ARROWOOD Ecology Graduate Group, University of California, Davis, CA., 95616 U.S.A. I tested two models (pair bonding; coyness) of the relationship between duetting and pair bonding with behavioral and vocal data from captive canary-winged parakeet (Brotogeris v. versicolurus) mates before and after their pair formations. In all pair formations, pair establishment preceded or occurred simulta- neously with well-coordinated, species-typical duets. There was no evidence of duet practise before pair initiation or improvement in duets during pair integration. Both models lead to the prediction that new</page><page sequence="150">792 VOLUME 106 pairs should duet more frequently early in their pairing compared to later. But duetting rates did not ex- hibit a peak early in the pair relationships. New pair duet rates increased relatively late (third to fourth week after pairing) in the pair history and did not show a decline over time. Affiliative interactions did not peak at the same time as duetting, as predicted by the pair-bonding model, nor did affiliative acts peak after a peak in duetting, as in the coyness model. Duetting rates of new pairs were not significantly dif- ferent from those of older pairs. Thus, although duetting is a cooperative, intrapair interaction, there is no evidence that it promotes pair bonding in canary-winged parakeets. A significant, positive correlation was found between duets and agonistic acts against others. The pair formation data and this correlation between duetting and agonism against others suggest that there has been selection for rapid acquisition of duetting ability with a new partner. If parakeet pairs spent prolonged periods learning their duets, they could lose status within the group and the ability to present a coordinated, united front in the competition for resources. This may have been the selection pressure that led pairing in canary-winged parakeets to be accomplished without recourse to coy behavioral or vocal strategies. Behaviour Vol. 106 (1988) pp. 158-182 FEATURE WEIGHTING IN SPECIES SONG RECOGNITION BY THE FIELD SPARROW (SPIZELLA PUSILLA) DOUGLAS A. NELSON The Rockefeller University, Field Research Center, Box 38B, RR 2, Millbrook, NY 12545, U.S.A. Computer-modified songs were presented to wild territorial male field sparrows to assess the relative im- portance of different acoustic features in species-song recognition. The features tested exhibited differing degrees of relative variability within field sparrow song. The experiments demonstrate that field sparrows are sensitive to changes in song frequency, number and order of phrases, trill-note duration, note 'shape', and internote interval. Field sparrows appear to be 'tuned' to the normal range of variation in song fea- tures. Responses decreased significantly when features in the experimental songs were changed by two to three standard deviations relative to a control song. These results contrast with previous conclusions that birds only use 'invariant' features in species-song recognition. However, manipulations of invariant fea- tures, frequency and number of phrases, interfered with recognition more than did an equally-noticeable change to a variable feature, inter-note interval. The number of phrases in a song and the duration of trill notes appear to be equally important recognition cues. Thus, field sparrows integrate information from at least five different features in species song recognition, but give more weight to information from an invariant feature, song frequency, than they do to information from variable features. Behaviour Vol. 106 (1988) pp. 183-251 THE COMMUNICATIVE REPERTOIRE OF CAPTIVE BONOBOS (PAN PANISCUS), COMPARED TO THAT OF CHIMPANZEES FRANS B.M. DE WAAL Winconsin Regional Primate Research Center, University of Wisconsin, 1223 Capitol Court, Madison, WI 53715-1299, U.S.A. Ten bonobos (Pan paniscus), housed in three separate subgroups at the San Diego Zoological Garden, were observed for 288 hours over a four-month period. The colony included one adult male, two adult females, two adolescent males, four juveniles, and one infant. Data on 5,135 sequences of social behavior were collected either as spoken accounts or as video recordings. In addition, high-quality sound recordings were obtained for spectrographic analysis. The data were subjected to a quantitative analysis of probabilities of association between 44 communicative behavior patterns and 40 different context types. The paper treats each communicative behavior pattern separately, providing a) its frequency, b) the most common inter-individual directions of performance, c) characteristic contexts, d) a description, e) a commentary on its possible functions, and f) a comparison with the behavior of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). The study shows that, while the behavioral repertoires of the two Pan species are fundamentally simi- lar, interesting differences exits in their vocal repertoires, sexual behavior, and agonistic behavior. The bonobo's voice has a higher pitch, and many of its vocalizations are structurally different from homol- ogous chimpanzee vocalizations. The greatest difference concerns the long-distance hooting calls of the two species. The bonobo's sexual behavior is much more elaborate than the chimpanzee's, including ventro-ventral copulation, and "GG-rubbing" between adult females. Sexual forms of contact seem to serve many of the reassurance and reconciliation functions fulfilled by nongenital contact forms in the</page><page sequence="151">VOLUME 106 793 chimpanzee. Finally, the bonobo's agonistic behavior is less elaborate and appears more controlled than the chimpanzee's. Behaviour Vol. 106 (1988) pp. 252-264 DOMINANCE RELATIONSHIPS IN JACKDAWS (CORVUS MONEDULA) BEAT WECHSLER Ethologie und Wildforschung, Zoologisches Institut, Universitat Zuirich-Irchel, Winterthurerstrasse 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland Dominance interactions (supplantings) of 26 jackdaws (Corvus monedula) living in a captive flock were recorded for a period of 2 years. The transitivity of the dominance hierarchy did not increase over time. Though there were 238 rank changes in course of the study, a portion of 6% of all possible triads of the flock was always intransitive. Only 16.5% of the observed supplantings involved aggressive behaviour. There was no significant correlation between the body weight of a jackdaw and its dominance rank. Male-Male dyads had a disproportionally high frequency of dominance interactions and rank changes. Females were more likely to gain in rank in course of a in rank change if their mate was already dominant to the opponent and to lose rank if their mate was subordinate to the opponent. With the males there was no such tendency. Only 5.4% of the observed dominance interactions were temporary reversals with respect to the defined dominance relationship of a dyad. The probability of temporary reversals was increased if the mate of the supplanting jackdaw was present (less than 60 cm away) during the dominance interaction even though it did not interfere. When it was present, it joined the supplanting interaction in 10% of the cases. Breeding jackdaws had an increased percentage of reversed dominance interactions in front or their nest box. This site-related dominance was especially marked as soon as the female started to incubate. Behaviour Vol. 106 (1988) pp. 265-278 SOME DETERMINANTS OF THE MATING SYSTEM IN A POPULATION OF PAINTED REED FROGS (HYPEROLIUS MARMORATUS) STEVEN R. TELFORD Department of Biological Sciences, University of Zimbabwe, P.O. Box MP167, Mount Pleasant, Harare MIRANDA L. DYSON Department of Zoology, University of the Witwatersrand, 1, Jan Smuts Avenue, Johannesburg, South Africa Hyperolius marmoratus shares its breeding site with 12 synchronously breeding species. Males call from elevated perches to attract females. Observations of captive populations suggest that males may adopt alternative mating strategies when chorus densities are high. Similar strategies were not observed in natural choruses. The operational sex ratio (OSR) was always male-biased and also highly variable. Mating was polygynous, only 25% of the male population actually mated. Females mated either once or twice. Variance in mating success was much greater among males, an obvious consequence of a skewed OSR. Female choice was probably not a causal factor because male mating success was correlated with neither size nor age. Size-based variation in the male advertisement call does exist, but females cannot exploit this potential vocal cue because of their impaired discriminatory ability in a complex sonic environment and the potential risk of mismating. Although the mating system may best be described as lek-like, with males forming organised choruses through competitive interactions, the variance in male mating success is probably a consequence of stochastic factors.</page><page sequence="152">794 VOLUME 106 Behaviour Vol. 106 (1988) pp. 279-300 LEAF SIZE RECOGNITION AND EVALUATION OF SOME ATTELABID WEEVILS (1) CHONOSTROPHEUS CHUJOI KAZUHIKO SAKURAI Department of Zoology, Faculty of Science, Kyoto University, Kitashirakawa-oiwake, Sakyo, Kyoto 606 Japan Leaf recognition of the female during cradle formation was studied using model leaves, young oak leaves moulded in several shapes; observation of behaviour preceding cutting and numerical analysis of cutting points were carried out. Females repeatedly perform a sequence of walking along the circumference via the leaf apex and then cut the leaf. Circumference length is the most probable determinant of the cutting point. It is hypothesized that females perceive the most protrusive point of the leaf, the leaf apex, and the circumference length by walking. A scheme, which consists of two mechanisms for circumference measurement, for the cutting point decision is proposed. Although females do not adjust the cutting point with respect to the number of eggs to be laid in the cradle, they perceive and use leaf area or something correlative to it, for the decision as to egg number.

The female always performed a sequence of stereotype behaviours preceding cutting. The results of this study indicate that the female firstly decides the number of eggs to be laid in the cradle and then starts looking for a leaf suitable for that number of eggs. While the female is making a cradle, she measures and perceives for different purposes three different distances on the leaf (or something that represents each of them: 1) the length of the whole leaf, i.e. the criterion of adequacy of a leaf for a cradle, 2) the leaf width, i.e. the criterion of adequacy of a leaf for a two-egg cradle, and 3) about 1 cm along the main vein from the leaf base, i.e. the determinant of the cutting site. These three are probably measured while the female is performing the stereotype walking. Measuring both leaf length and leaf width amounts to predicting the shape and the size of the cradle.</page><page sequence="153">VOLUME 107 795 Behaviour Vol. 107 (1988) pp. 1-14 AGE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN SIZE IN DETERMINING DOMINANCE AMONG WORKERS IN THE PRIMITIVELY EUSOCIAL WASP, POLISTES INSTABILIS COLIN R. HUGHES and JOAN E. STRASSMANN Biology Department, Rice University, P.O. Box 1982, Houston, TX 77251, U.S.A. In primitively eusocial wasps, dominance hierarchies predict which female will become queen when the original queen is removed. At each of 3 latitudes spanning a range from temperate sites to tropical ones, an older, dominant, worker of the primitively social wasp, P. instabilis, became the replacement queen. Thus, even in the tropics, this species follows a temperate queen replacement pattern rather than the standard tropical pattern in which young non-foragers have the highest rank and replace the queen. Old individuals are dominant even though they are often smaller than their subordinates. These results are surprising because large size increases the change of winning fights for queenship among Polistes females in other circumstances. Age-based dominance hierarchies may be stable in Polistes because colony members resist larger individuals' attempts to win high dominance rank by fighting. Behaviour Vol. 107 (1988) pp. 15-23 EXTRA-PAIR COPULATIONS IN BLACK-CAPPED CHICKADEES: THE ROLE OF THE FEMALE SUSAN M. SMITH Department of Biological Sciences, Mount Holyoke College, South Hadley, MA 01075, U.S.A. Extra-pair copulation (EPC) behaviour was observed in three resident, colour-banded populations of black- capped chickadees. Because these populations were nonmigratory, I was able to determine the relative winter rank of all individuals involved (the females, their mates, and the other males) in the months prior to each breeding season. Over 14 years, a total of 13 EPCs, involving 12 females and 10 'other' males, were seen. Every one of the 13 EPCs was with a male ranked higher than female's own mate. No female that was paired with an alpha male was ever seen engaging in an EPC. Only 4 observed EPCs occurred in the female's own territory; the other 9 all took place in the territory of the other male. Hence these females had apparently entered those territories to copulate with those resident males. All but one of the EPCs occurred within an hour of dawn, although WPCs are about equally likely to occur at any time of day. At least 4 of the observed EPCs occurred during the female's fertile period. No forced EPC attempts were seen. In resident species like chickadees, where females have the opportunity to learn the relative rank of all neighbouring males with respect to her own mate, females may regularly pursue the strategy of seeking out EPCs with superior partners. While lower-ranked males may suffer temporary losses through the EPCs of their mates, each male has some chance of attaining alpha rank if he lives long enough. Once at alpha rank, a male will likely engage in more EPCs, while having a mate that will no longer seek EPCs elsewhere.

VAN SCHAIK Laboratorium voor Vergelijkende Fysiologie, Rijksuniversiteit Utrecht, Jan van Galenstraat 40, 3572 LA Utrecht, The Netherlands The sexually mature males present in a multi-male group of monkeys differ among each other with respect to dominance position, age, duration of stay in the group and the likelihood of having offspring in the group. Focal animal samples were collected over a four year period in two groups of long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) in northern Sumatra to study their behaviour. 1. Residence time had only minor effects on male behaviour. 2. With increasing age males were less often involved in social interactions, but older males gave more contact calls and especially answered these more frequently. 3. A male's socio-spatial behaviour appeared to be strongly affected by his dominance rank. A drastic change in socio-spatial position occurred when a male had obtained the highest dominance rank, but only after the offspring he probably fathered were born.</page><page sequence="154">796 VOLUME 107 4. We concluded that a high chance of paternity strongly influenced a male's behaviour. Several aspects of the classic "alpha-role" could be related to paternity chances and not to current dominance rank. 5. A generalized career profile of males is constructed in order to facilitate comparison with other promis- cuous species.

Southern sea lions, Otaria byronia, seize suckling pups, and take them away from the breeding animals. Females did not leave the central breeding area in pursuit of their pups. 2. During four breeding seasons we recorded 285 pup seizures. A mean of 21% of 400 pups born each season were seized by subadult males. Fifty seven percent of the pups seized were abducted and held captive. 3. Subadult males treat pups in the same way that adult males treat adult females, sequestering them and preventing their escape. Males were possessive, held pups for up to two hours, and defended pups from other males. Pups attempting to escape were bitten, shaken from side to side, and tossed into the air. In 9% of the abductions males mounted pups, but intromission did not occur. 4. Abducted pups were sometimes injured and killed. Some pups had bite wounds on the neck, back and flippers, and lacerations on the head and neck; 5.6% of the pups seized, and 1.3% of the pups born each season died due to physical abuse. Dead pups had tooth puncture wounds and extensive haematomas. In addition, 19 pups abducted during four seasons were taken to sea; nine of these pups were not seen again and may have drowned. Since breeding is seasonal, females that lose a pup lose an entire breeding year. 5. Males do not obtain immediate reproductive benefits from pup abductions. Pups may be used as female substitutes by males that are sexually but not physically competitive with adults for mature mates. Through practice with pups, ousted males may gain experience in controlling adult females. Infanticide appears to be a by-product of males treating pups as females. Pups are vulnerable because of the superior force and larger size of abductors. Behaviour Vol. 107 (1988) pp. 62-71 VIGILANCE PATTERNS IN HUMANS MONIKA WAWRA Forschungsstelle fur Humanethologie in der Max-Planck-Gesellschaft, D 8138 Andechs, B.R.D. The scanning behaviour of humans eating was studied in a student's refectory. At group sizes two and three the group members did not alternate scanning behaviour. For group sizes 1-5 the average duration of the interscan intervals was correlated with group size. The frequency distributions of interscan intervals did not follow a negative exponential distribution. At all group sizes studied people did not scan randomly. Non-talking persons in dyads increased duration, but not frequently of looking up compared to talking persons at the same group size. Both frequency and duration of looking up of these non-talking people were lower than that of the singletons. Thus, interaction between group members cannot be the cause of the decrease in vigilance with increasing group size. The fact that the results of this study correspond with the results of studies on animal scanning behaviour suggests that looking for predators may once have been a reason for scanning in humans, too.</page><page sequence="155">VOLUME 107 Behaviour Vol. 107 (1988) pp. 72-90 THERMOREGULATORY BEHAVIOUR OF SOUTHERN SEA LIONS AND ITS EFFECT ON MATING STRATEGIES CLAUDIO CAMPAGNA Centro Nacional Patag6nico, 9120 Puerto Madryn, Argentina BURNEY J. LE BOEUF Institute of Marine Sciences and Biology Department, University of California, Santa Cruz, 95064 CA, U.S.A. Southern sea lions, Otaria byronia, breed during the Austral summer on flat rocky shelves containing tidepools and boulders, or on wide, uniform pebble beaches lacking tidepools and shade. The first substrate provides breeding animals with relief from heat stress, the second does not. A three-year study of two rookeries at Peninsula Valdes, Argentina, from 1985 to 1987 revealed major differences in mating behaviour and mating success of males, associated with temperature, solar radiation and rookery topography. At Puerto Piramide, males defended territories containing tidepools throughout the breeding season. Ther- moregulatory requirements caused females to concentrate in tidepool areas, and males completed aggres- sively for these recources. Seven males that defended territories with large, water-renewable tidepools copulated a mean of 11.6 ± 4.2 times during three weeks, versus a mean of 1.4 ± 1.4 times for ten males that defended territories without tidepools. The latter lost their females and went to sea when air temperature rose over 30°C. At Punta Norte, the homogeneous pebble substrate forced animals to breed in a narrowly confined area along the high tide mark, where the substrate remained wet. Only those males holding females in this narrow zone copulated. All of 32 marked males that associated with females near the high tide mark copulated. Males breeding outside of this narrow strip of beach deserted and lost females after 1-3 hrs of air temperatures &gt; 30°C, and solar radiations &gt; 1.2 cal/cm2/min. Rookery topography and associated thermoregulatory constraints critical variables shaping breeding behav- iour in southern sea lions. The thermal and physical environment is a determinant of the social behaviour of otariids and has been important in shaping their social system. Behaviour Vol. 107 (1988) pp. 91-106 COMPETITION OF MARINE IGUANA FEMALES (AMBLYRHYNCHUS CRISTATUS) FOR EGG-LAYING SITES NORBERT RAUCH Max-Planck-Institut fur Verhaltensphysiologie, D-8130 Seewiesen Post Starnberg, F.R.G. Egg-laying behaviour of marine iguana females (Amblyrhynchus cristatus) was studied on the island of Santa Cruz, Galapagos. Females (mean weight 1206 g, SVL 29.5 cm) wandered from the colonies on the lava coast to sandy areas, where in about 3 days they chose a place, dug a hole, and after laying guarded the site for ca 5 days (Fig. 1). Most females laid their 1-4 eggs, mean 96.9 g, between mid-February and early March (Fig. 2), when fights occurred between seeking and guarding females. Young hatched after ca 101 days (mean mass 61 g, mean SVL 10.2 cm). No connection could be found between laying date or number of females at the egg laying sites on the one hand and distance of laying site from the sea and substrate composition on the other. The distance of laying sites from cover was found to depend significantly on the laying date and strength of competition (Figs 3, 4); laying sites close to cover were first choice, but they were limited. Lightweight (weaker) females avoided strong competition at the laying peak by laying early or late (comp. Fig. 5). Eggs were guarded the longer the earlier they were laid (Fig. 6). Some medium-strength females invaded areas already occurred and laid in the peak period, but were expelled again by later intruders after 2-3 days. The clutches of these invaders were in effect guarded concomitantly. 797</page><page sequence="156">798 VOLUME 107 Behaviour Vol. 107 (1988) pp. 107-121 SOCIAL STATUS, CIRCULATING LEVELS OF HORMONES, AND COMPETITION FOR FOOD IN WINTER FLOCKS OF THE WHITE-THROATED SPARROW HUBERT SCHWABL, MARILYN RAMENOFSKY, INGRID SCHWABL-BENZINGER, DONALD S. FARNER and JOHN C. WINGFIELD The Rockefeller University Field Research Center, Tyrrel Road, Millbrook, NY 12545, U.S.A. and Department of Zoology, University of Washington, Seattle, Wa. 98195, U.S.A. We measured plasma levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone (T), 5a-dihy-drotestosterone (DHT) and corticosterone (B) in flocks of wintering white-throated sparrows. This species occurs in two colour morphs that are distinguishable by white or tan colour of the median crown stripe and differ in frequency of agonistic behaviour during the reproductive season. During winter, white-throated sparrows form flocks that are characterized by dominance hierarchies, in which social rank was correlated with sex and age, but not with crown colour. Plasma levels of LH and androgens (T and DHT) were basal in most free-living and captive birds and not correlated with sex, age, morph or social rank. Plasma levels of testosterone did not increase in captive groups, when aggressive interactions increased due to experimental manipulation of distribution and amount of food. These results suggest (1) that dominant-subordinate relationships during the wintering phase are not based on differential aggression of plumage types and (2) that they are not maintained by elevated plasma levels of androgens in high-ranking birds. Plasma concentrations of B increased rapidly with duration of capture stress in females and first-years males, but not in adult males. Since adult males were of highest rank it appears that high social status may restrain acute adrenal response to stress. Further, baseline levels of B were highest in low-ranking first-year females and lowest in high-ranking adult males. In captive groups, amount and distribution of food resources altered levels of B. Levels appeared to be most variable and very high in some birds of intermediate rank, when agonistic interactions in competition for food were most frequent. This suggests greater impact of change in food distribution on those birds, whose social status is less clear than that of high or low ranking birds.

In the Exchange experiments adult starlings feed a strange brood, introduced at their original nest site up to 16 days post hatch, as frequent as their own young, resulting in a normal weight gain of the strange young. 2. Confronted with a 19 day old alien brood and their own young simultaneously, some adults still occasionally feed the strange young while others are already able to restrict their parental care to their own offspring. 3. Not until the young are aged 20 days or more, the adults are definitely able to discriminate between own and alien young in the immediate vicinity of the original nesting hole (Choice experiments) or within 10 to 20 m (Search experiments). 4. The experiments altogether show that offspring recognition in Starlings develops only a few days prior to fledging, i.e. by the time the young run the risk of intermingling with other conspecific broods.

These larvae exhibit a secretory reflexive defense. The first experiment showed that even if a hunter has palpated or attacked a chrysomeline larva only one time, it will avoid or flee this type of prey on subsequent encounters.

The escape behaviour shown by the hunters is compared to other kinds of locomotion.</page><page sequence="157">VOLUME 107 799 Behaviour Vol. 107 (1988) pp. 138-156 COMPLEX ORGANIZATION OF THE-WARBLING SONG IN THE EUROPEAN STARLING STURNUS VULGARIS M. ADRET-HAUSBERGER Laboratoire d'Ethologie, UA CNRS 373, Universite de Rennes, Campus de Beaulieu, 35042 Rennes Cedex, France P.F. JENKINS Department of Zoology, University of Auckland, Private Bag, Auckland, New Zealand Male starlings sing two very different categories of song: whistles and warbles. The present study describes the structure and the organization of warbling song in individuals from varied geographical origins. In all cases, warbling is shown to be an extremely complex song in which there is much contrast: very different notes follow each other and are even superimposed. Higher levels of organizations are present: notes are grouped in repeating units, the motifs, each of which is sung in bouts of 1 to 12 repetitions, and finally these bouts show a clear sequential organization. A certain amount of variability occurs at each of these levels: slight variations are seen from one rendition of a given motif to the next; the number of repetitions of each motif varies from one song sequence to another and the sequential organization of bouts seems to be able to vary seasonally. All these characteristics were found in all individuals. Nevertheless, warbling appears to be an essentially individual song. Beyond two or three species-specific motifs, the others in the repertoire are individually characteristic. The beginnings and endings of the songs are clearly defined commencing usually with an individual motif whilst ending with a species-specific motif. We observed marked differences between individuals in repertoire size, extending from about 20 to more than 35 different motifs. This is the only measure of the repertoire that we have been able to define for this continuous song. Behaviour Vol. 107 (1988) pp. 157-185 INTRASPECIFIC VARIATION IN EXTRA-PAIR COPULATION AND MATE DEFENCE IN COMMON GUILLEMOTS URIA AALGE B.J. HATCHWELL Department of Zoology, The University, Western Bank, Sheffield S1O 2TN, England Extra-pair copulation (EPC) in common guillemots was frequent during the pre-laying period. Although guillemots are essentially monogamous, males adopted a mixed reproductive strategy (MRS) by attempting to obtain forced extra-pair copulations (FEPC) during the female's fertile period, which was estimated to start 25 days prior to laying. Males spent more time at the colony than females and exhibited highly synchronized cycles of attendance during the pre-laying period in order to defend their partner against EPC attempts. By doing so they probably incurred some energetic cost. Pair copulation started as soon as the adults returned to the colony (4-5 months before the star of egg- laying), when it probably serves a pair-bonding function. From about 25 days before egg-laying (day -25) the PC rate increased, peaking at about day -12. It was estimated that guillemots copulated 22 times in the three weeks prior to egg-laying. The FEPC rate increased towards egg-laying and was more closely correlated with date than with the relative number of males present, although the number of males involved in each FEPC attempt increased towards laying. During the fertile period, 10% of all observed copulation attempts were FEPCs. However, the success rate (the proportion achieving cloacal contact) of FEPCs was much lower (6%) than that of PCs (74%). Females also employed an MRS, occasionally soliciting or co-operating in unforced extra- pair copulations (UEPCs) when their male partner was absent from the colony. UEPCs were much more successful (95%) than FEPCs, but also less frequent. The effect of breeding density on copulation behaviour was examined. FEPCs were more frequent at high breeding densities than at low density. The probability of obtaining FEPC insemination for males with two or more neighbours was about ten times that of males with no neighbours. Similarly, the risk of cuckoldry increased with density. Three hypotheses were considered concerning the effect of density on the PC rate: the 'dilution' hypothesis predicted a higher PC rate at high density, and the 'disguise' and 'interference' hypotheses predicted a lower PC rate at high breeding density. The PC rate decreased with increasing density as a result of disruption of PCs by neighbouring males attempting to obtain FEPCs, a result consistent with the 'interference' hypothesis.</page><page sequence="158">VOLUME 107 The reproductive success of males obtaining EPCs, cuckolded males, and non-EPC/non-cuckold males was examined, and a selective advantage of 10% estimated for successful EPC males over cuckolds. Behaviour Vol. 107 (1988) pp. 186-207 DEVELOPMENT AND REPRODUCTIVE STRATEGIES IN BOMBUS TERRESTRIS COLONIES M.J. DtJCHATEAU and H.H.W. VELTHUIS Dept. of Comparative Physiology, University of Utrecht, P.O. Box 80.086, 3508 TB Utrecht, The Netherlands The development and the reproductive output of 26 Bombus terrestris colonies were investigated. Four important points in colony development are distinguished. These are: a) the start of egg laying by the queen, leading to the beginning of the eusocial phase, the emergence of the first workers; b) the moment which we term the switch point, at which the queen switches from laying diploid eggs (producing workers or queens) to the laying of haploid eggs (producing males); c) the onset of queen production reared from diploid eggs; d) the loss of dominance by the queen, expressed by the beginning of aggression on the part of queen and workers, worker oviposition, oophagy and the functional elimination of the queen. This we call the competition point. The onset of queen production is highly correlated with the competition point but not correlated with the switch point. The pattern in time of the egg laying by a queen differed from the rate of increase of worker numbers published by previous authors. After an initial and slow phase, in which two broods of egg cells are produced, the rate of egg laying of a queen becomes constant, whether or not the eggs are fertilized. The transformation from this rate of egg laying to the earlier descriptions of increase in number is only possible if one neglects differences between colonies in time spent in the production of the two broods as well as the highly variable time needed for development into adults. The time at which the competition point occurs is much more predictable (at day 30.8 ± 4.9 after the emergence of the first worker) than the switch point. The latter ranges from day 6 to day 32. In our colonies two groups can be discerned, one of early switching colonies (at day 9.8 ± 2.4), the other of late switching colonies (at day 23.4 ± 4.6). The occurrence of the switch cannot be predicted from preceding behavioural or demographic data. As a consequence of the early switch such colonies produce mainly males. Partly due to the unfavourable larva/worker ratio only a few queens were reared from the last laid diploid eggs. In contradiction the late switching colonies produce on average sexuals at a 1.3: 1 sex ratio (1:1.7 investment ratio). Remarkable however, biomass of sexuals is equal in both types of colonies. Males are about half the weight of queens. Certain colonies invest in males only ("3 males: 0 queens"). Since the two types of colonies occurred in about equal numbers, our local population is characterized by a 4: 1 (cd : ) sex ratio. This male biased sex ratio, also observed for other bumblebees species (B. terricola and B. melanopygus, OWEN et. al., 1980; OWEN &amp; PLOWRIGHT, 1982), contrasts with existing theoretical models based on kin selection (TRIVERS &amp; HARE, 1976) or local mate competition (ALEXANDER &amp; SHERMAN, 1977) arguments. A model is proposed in which the males of the early switching colonies monopolize the matings due to their early appearance in the field. In fact, the early switching colonies, by investing mainly in males, parasitize on the reproductive strategy of the late switching colonies, which are characterized by a 1:1 sex ratio. At population level the two reproductive strategies are in equilibrium at a 1:1 frequency.

Nestlings were banded and 47 sons whose farther's songs had been recorded acquired territories. Some fathers had more than one son who acquired a territory. The songs of 263 territorial neighbours of the sons were also recorded. In addition, there were 32 females for whom both the farther's and the mate's songs were available. The songs that were sung on the two study areas differed in a number of qualitative and quantitative aspects. For each area, there was change across years, in qualitative composition of song types, as well 800</page><page sequence="159">VOLUME 107 801 as considerable variability in the properties of the songs within dialect areas throughout the course of the study. There were 49 instances in which the song of a territory holder was recorded for more than one year. These individuals exhibited considerable stability of song across years. The song types of sons and fathers and of sons and neighbours were compared; Analysis of these songs indicated that some sons sang the song of the father, some adopted a song similar to that of the neighbours, and some had song with idiosyncratic elements that, in a few cases, remained in the population during succeeding generations. These data provided no support for the hypothesis that sons learned song preferentially from the father: there was tendency for the quantitative characteristics of the songs of sons and fathers to be more similar than those of sons and neighbours, and when a father had two sons whose song was known, there was little tendency for the three songs to resemble one another. Finally, the songs of a father and his daughter's mate did not tend to resemble one another, indicating that females of this species do not choose as mates males that sing the same song as their father's. These results suggest that variability in transmission of song types may play a role in individual recognition, which in turn might aid a male to acquire a territory. Behaviour Vol. 107 (1988) pp. 241-266 GROUP RESPONSES TO SPECIALLY SKILLED INDIVIDUALS IN A MACACA FASCICULARIS GROUP EDUARD STAMMBACH Ethology and Wildlife Research, University of Zurich, Switzerland The aim of this study was to investigate the capability of monkeys to assess special characteristics in conspecifics. In a first phase I ascertained that all members of a colony of longtailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) were able to attain food by manipulating a one lever apparatus, thus introducing the "tradition" of lever pulling. Then, experiments were carried out on subgroups of the colony where only one of the lower ranking subgroup members was trained to succeed in a more complex task where three levels had to be pulled in a correct sequence. Eight specialists were established in sequence. These specialists became food producers for themselves and for the other group members. Each trial of a specialist's series was carried out in two phases. In the first, the food phase, the food dispensing apparatus was active and responses of other subgroup members to the food producing specialist were observed. In the second, the social phase, the apparatus remained inactive and observations focused on social interactions of the subgroup. As expected, primarily high ranking subgroup members attempted to participate in the food rewards gained by the specialist. It is shown that high ranking animals began to hold back their initial chasing of the specialist from the food site in course of the trials and were soon tolerated to sit near the subordinate food producer. Furthermore, some of the non-specialists began to follow or even to pass the specialist when he was approaching the apparatus to manipulate the levers. These non-specialists thus indicated that they were able to anticipate later actions. In seven out of 55 specialist-non-specialist relationships all predicted changes in social interactions occurred. In the majority of the dyads in which a change in social affiliation was registered an increase of grooming or spatial proximity was positively correlated with the amount of benefit gained from the specialist. In the social phase of the trials the non-specialists gave more grooming to the food producers and maintained spatial proximity even in this second phase. To conclude: At least some of the group members became aware of the skills of the specialists and adapted their behaviour accordingly as if to maximize benefits from their skills. Previous studies had already suggested that monkeys know about social position, social relationships and kinship of group members. This study adds a new aspect of knowledge, namely knowledge on capabilities and skills of others. Differential knowledge allows monkeys to select partners optimally according to their skills and social position.</page><page sequence="160">802 VOLUME 107 Behaviour Vol. 107 (1988) pp. 267-277 THE SPREAD OF FOOD PRODUCING TECHNIQUES IN A CAPTIVE FLOCK OF JACKDAWS BEAT WECHSLER Ethologie und Wildforschung, Zoologisches Institut, Universitait Ziirich-Irchel, Winterthurerstrasse 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland The spread of techniques to get peeled oats from a food dispenser was observed in a captive flock of 28 jackdaws (Corvus monedula) in two replicates.

The results can not falsify the hypothesis of individual learning regardless of the partner's knowledge about a successful technique. Pair members did not learn faster from each other than members of non-pair dyads. Pair members did not preferentially acquire the same technique. There was no indication that the rate of technique acquisition within the flock increased with the number of established technicians. Qualitative observations support the explanation of individual trial-and-error learning. Behaviour Vol. 107 (1988) pp. 278-296 MATERNAL FOOD-SUPPLY ACTIVITY AND ITS REGULATION IN COELOTES TERRESTRIS (ARANEAE, AGELENIDAE) JEAN-LUC GUNDERMANN, ANDRE HOREL and BERTRAND KRAFFT Laboratoire de Biologie du Comportement, Universitd de Nancy 1, BP 239 54506 Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France The funnel-web spider Coelotes terrestris (Agelenidae) displays extended maternal care, especially char- acterized by a progressive provisioning of the young during a four-eight week gregarious phase. As they grow up, the spiderlings are provided with a increasing amount of prey, which is captured on the web and carried by the mother into the silk tube that represents the nest. This paper is aimed to determine the mechanism that could regulate, throughout the gregarious phase, this food-supply activity. Eleven females were observed, at different times, from one week before egg-laying till one week after the progeny's dispersal. Females' feeding behaviour noticeably changed from the young's emergence onwards. In particular, the prey was less and less handled and the overall time during which the mother kept her prey for herself-Prey Handling Time (PHT)-steadily decreased. Meanwhile, the spiderlings reacted more and more rapidly to the mother's prey catching and carrying, and they stimulated her more and more actively. The mother's prey-supply behaviour was experimentally shown to be modifiable within a short delay. Separating the mother from her brood made her shift her "Prey Handling Time" from a few minutes to more than two hours (i.e. about the level of the pre-emergence of the PHT). Conversely, reuniting the mother with her brood lead to an equivalent decrease of the PHT. This phenomenon was obtained at four different periods during the gregarious phase. The present study shows that, in this invertebrates species, the maternal provisioning activity is essentially regulated by exogenous factors: i.e. stimulations (that qualitatively and quantitatively variate in the course of time) emanating from the developing progeny.

MORSE Graduate Program in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Division of Biology and Medicine, Brown University, Providence, RI 02912 U.S.A. I tested the roles of insect prey presence, abundance, and distance in the selection of hunting sites by crab spiders Misumena vatia (Thomisidae) on milkweed inflorescences. Since the inflorescences on a single plant differ in numbers of prey attracted, one can also assess the effect of relative prey abundance on patch choice as overall prey abundance in an area changes.</page><page sequence="161">VOLUME 107 803 About three-fourths of the spiders chose the inflorescence attracting the most insects on a plant at densities from half to twice the normal prey, and in tests with additional prey presented at close range. Thus they appear to respond to relative prey densities in patch choice, and their accuracy of choice remains constant over a wide range of prey abundance. However, spiders without prey, and ones that had just fed, selected sites randomly. Individuals from all the other experiments left inflorescences, especially high-quality ones, more often as overall prey density increased. This result closely fits a risk-sensitivity model that predicts mobility in choice of hunting site if average prey availability exceeds that required to produce a clutch of eggs.</page><page sequence="162">804 VOLUME 108 Behaviour Vol. 108 (1989) pp. 1-9 ON THE ACOUSTIC BASIS OF RECOGNITION OF THE MOTHER HEN BY THE CHICK IN THE DOMESTIC FOWL (GALLUS GALLUS) J.P. KENT Ballyrichard House, Arklow, Co. Wicklow, Ireland The maternal cluck vocalizations of the bantam hen were examined using a sonagraph. 3 consecutive clucks from each of 6 hens were examined. Eight physical parameters from each vocalization were mea- sured directly from the spectrograms, namely duration of the cluck, maximum frequency at the beginning of the cluck, maximum absolute frequency of the cluck, maximum frequency at the end of the cluck, positive pitch change, negative pitch change, positive slope and negative slope. The coefficient of variation of these parameters show considerable variation between the clucks (Table 1). A two-way ANOVA shows that this variation is due to differences between the hens and not to differences between consecutive clucks of the same hen. The differences between hens was significant on 4 of the 8 parameters measured. The correlations between two consecutive clucks from each of the 6 hens was statistically significant for 3 of the 8 parameters (Table 2). Further no significant differences were found between clucks recorded on day 3 and clucks recorded on day 9 (Table 3). The measures of slope are correlated with the duration of the slope and with the duration of the cluck showing that as changes occur in one parameter corresponding changes will take place in another parameter. Thus the chick may utilize a gestalt of 2 or more parameters of the cluck to recognize the mother hen. The maternal cluck is of a significantly longer duration and delivered at a slower rate than the maternal food call. They are two distinct calls. The results suggest that there is sufficient variability between the clucks of different hens for the chick to discriminate between her own mother and an alien hen on the basis of cluck vocalizations. The similarity between successive cluck and between clucks of the same hen recorded on different days suggest that the chick should be able to leam the individual characteristics of the hens maternal cluck, and thus use them for recognition of mother hen. Behaviour Vol. 108 (1989) pp. 10-22 THE EFFECT OF RELEASE TIME ON THE MIGRATORY BEHAVIOUR OF BALTIC SALMON (SALMO SALAR): INFLUENCE OF AN ANNUAL TIME PROGRAM TORLEIF ERIKSSON Department of Animal Ecology, University of Ume'a, S-901 87 Ume'a, Sweden 1. This study evaluates a field experiment testing a hypothesis that migration of Baltic salmon (Salmo salar L.) is influenced by an annual time program, affecting the migratory pattern during the sea phase. According to the hypothesis, migratory distance in the Baltic should be a result of a migratory activity sequence rather than a definite goal orientation. 2. During three years 1980-82 a total of about 18.000 individually tagged two year old hatchery-reared Baltic salmon smolts were used. At time of normal smoltrun smolts of the Angerman river stock were transferred to the sea and kept in netpens located north of the river mouth. Each year there were two groups of delayed releases. These groups of fish were released 2-6 months after transfer to the sea site. Fish released in the river and in the sea at normal time of smoltrun served as controls. 3. A seasonal difference in migratory propensity (i.e. readiness for migratory activity) was apparent in the experiment. Nettings carried out 2-3 weeks after release showed that a considerable fraction of the released salmon, after a delay of 4-6 months, lose their migratory propensity and stay during the following winter in the vicinity of the release area. This conclusion was supported by a high rate of recaptures reported by local fishermen. Delayed release postsmolts were caught throughout autumn and winter in the release area. 4. A generally shorter distance between release point and area of recapture was showed among fish that were detained before release compared to the fish released at normal time of smoltrun. The migratory distance appeared to be inversely related to period of delay before release. During all three years, salmon released with a 4-6 months delay were recaptured significantly closer to the release point than fish released in June (student's t-test, p &amp;lt; 0.05). 5. The results from the experiments give no reason to reject the hypothesis that the migratory behaviour of Baltic salmon is under the influence of an annual time program affecting the propensity for migration,</page><page sequence="163">VOLUME 108 and thereby the travelled distance. The function of an annual time program and the relevance of a precise timing of migration is discussed. Behaviour Vol. 108 (1989) pp. 23-43 LIMITATIONS OF A GENERALIST: A FIELD COMPARISON OF FORAGING SNAKES HUGH DRUMMOND and CONSTANTINO MACIAS GARCIA Centro de Ecologia, Universidad Nacional Aut6noma de Mexico, A.P. 70-275, Delegaci6n Coyoacan, 04510 DF, Mexico The assumption that a "jack-of-all-trades" is master of none was examined by comparing a snake that forages under water and in air (a terrestrial-aquatic generalist) with a congener that forages only under water (an aquatic specialist). Thamnophis eques is a generalist species because across its geographic range it feeds at the air/water interface, underwater and on land, taking amphibious, aquatic and terrestrial prey; T melanogaster is an aquatic specialist, everywhere feeding underwater on aquatic prey. Both snakes were studied at an isolated desert pond where the main prey was the Rio Grande leopard frog (Rana berlandieri). Thamnophis eques ate frogs and late-stage tadpoles, and small numbers of other anurans, mammals and lizards, whereas T melanogaster ate leopard frog tadpoles of all developmental stages and a few frogs. Different frog life stages were captured by the two snakes even when foraging simultaneously in the pond. Thamnophis eques foraged mainly over the water surface and shoreline and also strayed from the pond, whereas T. melanogaster foraged mainly underwater and only in the pond. When the frog population crashed in the second year, T melanogaster continued to prey on tadpoles and reproduced normally, but the numbers, foraging activity and reproduction of T eques declined drastically. Apparently, the terrestrial-aquatic generalist was unable to forage profitably on tadpoles, probably because it is ineffective underwater (compared with a congener specialised in that medium). Despite its broad died and foraging repertoire, T eques may be a truly effective predator only on frogs at the air/water interface; possibly aquatic prey are taken only when especially vulnerable, and terrestrial prey can only be added to the diet opportunistically. In contrast, T melanogaster appears limited to strictly aquatic foraging, never opportunistically adding terrestrial prey. Different use of tadpole developmental stages by the two snakes indicates that the reported special vul- nerability of late stages holds for generalist but not aquatically specialized snake predators. Failure of T. melanogaster to forage when tadpoles were at peak abundance could be due to an inability to forage profitably when the mean temperature is below 19°C, a limitation that frogs may exploit by ovipositing early. Behaviour Vol. 108 (1989) pp. 44-56 NODDING: AN APPEASEMENT BEHAVIOUR OF PIGEONS (COLUMBA LIVIA) ANGELIKA WOSEGIEN Zoologisches Institut, Martin-Luther-King-Platz 3, D-2000 Hamburg 13, F.R.G. JURG LAMPRECHT Max-Planck-Institut fir Verhaltensphysiologie, D-8131 Seewiesen, F.R.G. A variety of displays performed by social animals in agonistic encounters are termed "appeasement behaviours", although experimental proof of the appeasing effect is rare. In pigeons, nodding occurs in both sexes during courtship and pair formation, often in response to an aggressive act of the mate. Tame domestic pigeons (Columba livia) which courted and attacked the human hand, were used to test the effect of imitations of nodding versus two alternative stimuli: the hand held still in front of the bird or waved horizontally. In all six birds (two males and four females) presentation of the nodding hand had two effects: (1) It instantaneously reduced or stopped aggressive pecking (inhibition), and (2) it stimulated -faster than the other stimuli-the occurrence of nest demonstration, a squatting attitude characterizing a non-aggressive state (appeasement). Low correlation between peck rate and time until nest demonstration (latency) suggested that inhibition and appeasement are based on different motivational processes. The significant decrease of both peck rate and latency over the 20 day testing period probably reflected habituation to the mate's presence. The combined information from this and other studies suggests that short- and long-term processes are both involved in the development of non-aggressive long-term relationships between aggressive conspecifics. 805</page><page sequence="164">806 VOLUME 108 Behaviour Vol. 108 (1989) pp. 57-72 THE ROLE OF FREQUENCY MODULATION IN THE PROCESS OF DISTRESS CALLS RECOGNITION BY THE STARLING (STURNUS VULGARIS) THIERRY AUBIN Laboratoire d'Ethologie Experimentale de St. Lucien, C.N.R.S. UA 667, 28210 Nogent-Le-Roi, France By way to examine the hypothesis that some parameters of the frequency modulation (FM) are the key features of the process of decoding of birds' distress calls, the reaction of starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) to various synthetic, frequency modulated, calls were tested. Playback sessions were performed in the field. Three series of experiments were carried out. 1) In the first series, we made two synthetic signals, each having a very simplified FM structure by comparison with a natural distress call. A simple slope was applied to a carrier frequency which followed the acoustic features of a natural call. The extreme values of the slope were kept within the natural range of the species and they differed only by the sign of the slope. The signal with the positive slope induced positive responses: the one with the negative slope did not. 2) In the second series, we constructed three signals which differed from each other by the rise in frequency, i.e. the gradient of the slope. For two of the signals, this gradient was well outside the natural range for the species. No consistent or significant differences were found between the responses to these different signals. 3) In the third series, we synthesized six signals with sections of increasing, decreasing and constant frequency, in different combination. Signals which combined increasing and constant frequency sections elicited positive responses, independently of the other of the sections. In contrast, signals with decreasing and constant frequency sections were not recognized. When increasing and decreasing sections were present together in the same signal, the birds reactions depended on the order of the successive sections. If the increasing section preceded the decreasing one, starlings exhibited in most cases positive responses. In the contrary case, they responded weakly to the signal. Three points emerge from these series of experiments: 1) the starling follows a very simple law for the decoding of its distress vocalizations: an ascending FM (positive slope) is required to evoke positive responses: 2) the decoding law is very strict with regard to the sign of the slope: falling frequencies lead to a rejection of the signal by the starling. This rejection is particularly obvious when the entire signal presents a descending FM or when the signal begins with a decreasing FM; 3) the decoding law is very flexible with regard to the value of the rise in frequency and to the form of the ascending FM. These values can fall well outside the range found in natural distress calls, yet still be recognized. Thus, a phenomenon of asymmetry between the coding and decoding possibilities appears in the starling distress calls.

Mantled howling monkeys, Alouatta palliata palliata, of Guanacaste, Costa Rica, respond in a site- dependent way to experimental playbacks of choruses of loud vocalizations. Groups of howling monkeys increase their rates of calling and approach simulated vocal intruders located in often-used patches of forest. In contrast, they call less than previously and do not approach simulated intruders in seldom-used areas. These monkeys adjust their responses to simulated intruders depending upon the quality of local patches of forest. Various additional factors determine the functions of loud calls of howling monkeys: the distance to a receiver, the "ontogenetic trajectory" (WILEY, 1981) of the caller, the density of calling groups and possibly the existence of an ongoing confrontation.</page><page sequence="165">VOLUME 108 807 Behaviour Vol. 108 (1989) pp. 104-113 THE RELATIVE GROWTH OF DOMINANT AND SUBORDINATE JUVENILE STEELHEAD TROUT (SALMO GAIRDNERI) FED EQUAL RATIONS JEREMY C. ABBOTT and LAWRENCE M. DILL Department of Biological Sciences, Simon Fraser University, Bumaby, B.C. Canada V5A 1S6 The hypothesis that behavioural dominants experience growth advantages relative to subordinates was tested in size-matched pairs of juvenile steelhead trout (Salmo gairdneri). Even though access to food was equalized, dominants grew 12.3% faster on average than paired subordinates. As subordinates were less active than dominants this growth difference is attributed to the physiological costs of "stress". Behaviour Vol. 108 (1989) pp. 114-124 ADULT-WEANLING RECOGNITION AMONG CAPTIVE MEADOW VOLES (MICROTUS PENNSYLVANICUS) MICHAEL H. FERKIN Biology Department, Boston University, Boston, MA, 02215 U.S.A. Dyadic encounters and odour preference tests were carried out to determine the behavioural mechanisms mediating weanling-adult interactions in meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus. Encounters between weanlings and the adult(s) which they were reared contained few agonistic behaviours. Encounters between weanlings and an unfamiliar adult, independently of genetic relatedness, contained many agonistic acts. Encounters involving female weanlings were less agonistic than encounters involving male weanlings. Weanlings often preferred the odour of adults with whom they would have an amicable encounter, whereas weanlings avoided the odour of adults with whom they would have an agonistic encounter. However, female weanlings preferred the odour of their RA father to the odour of other adult males. Adults could not recognize their own offspring if they were reared apart. Social recognition was based on familiarity by association rather than phenotype-matching. The data suggest that adult agonism toward weanlings may be a behavioural mechanism regulating sex-biased dispersal patterns. Behaviour Vol. 108 (1989) pp. 125-138 VARIATION IN THE SONG OF THE AQUATIC WARBLER ACROCEPHALUS PALUDICOLA IN RESPONSE TO PLAYBACK OF DIFFERENT SONG STRUCTURES CLIVE K. CATCHPOLE and BERND LEISLER Department of Biology, Royal Holloway &amp; Bedford New College, University of London, Egham, Surrey, U.K. and Max-Planck-Institut, Vogelwarte Radolfzell, F.R.G. Songs of the aquatic warbler (Acrocephalus paludicola) can be classified on a structural basis into three main types, A, B and C. A songs are the shortest, and consist of one, simple phrase. B songs consist of the same simple phrase, followed by a second more complex phrase. C songs are the longest and most complex, consisting of more than two such phrases. During spontaneous singing, males produced approximately equal numbers of B and C songs. During playback, males produced hardly any C songs, about the same number of B songs, and large numbers of A songs. The number of A songs produced was inversely correlated with distance of approach to the speaker. When a mixture of A and B songs were played, males produced more A songs in response but did not approach so near to the speaker. When only C songs were played, males produced fewer A songs but approached closer to the speaker. The evidence suggest that A songs are only used as a short range aggressive signal, and B songs mainly as a long range territorial proclamation. Although there was no direct evidence, C songs may function as a long range sexual attractant. When studies on other Acrocephalus species are also considered, the overall trend is for intrasexual selection to produce short, simple territorial songs and intersexual selection to produce longer, more complex songs for mate attraction.</page><page sequence="166">808 VOLUME 108 Behaviour Vol. 108 (1989) pp. 139-159 SONG LEARNING IN ADULT GREAT TITS (PARUS MAJOR): EFFECTS OF NEIGHBOURS PETER K. McGREGOR and JOHN R. KREBS Edward Grey Institute of Field Ornithology, Department of Zoology, South Parks Road, Oxford OXI 3PS, England The songs of individually marked male great tits in a nestbox population were recorded over 10 years. The number of songs sung by an individual (repertoire size) did not change with the age of the bird. However, the song types making up the repertoire (repertoire composition) showed change; such changes were the rule in our study. The songs added to repertoires were most similar to those of newly arrived neighbours, suggesting that songs were learned from them. This result suggests that the period for song learning to sing can extend throughout adult life in this species and is comparable in timing to the timing of song learning for discrimination tasks such as neighbour recognition and laboratory operant conditioning. The functional significance of this pattern of song learning is discussed. Behaviour Vol. 108 (1989) pp. 160-195 IS BEING LARGE MORE IMPORTANT FOR FEMALE THAN FOR MALE PARASITIC WASPS? J. VAN DEN ASSEM, J.J.A. VAN IERSEL and R.L. LOS-DEN HARTOGH Zoological Laboratory, Division Ethology, University of Leiden, P.O.Box 9516, 2300 RA Leiden, The Netherlands We compared the impact of differences in body size on reproductive success of males and females in a species of parasitic wasps (Lariophagus distinguendus; Hym., Chalcidoidea, Pteromalidae), in an effort to obtain an estimate of the consequences of being large or small in terms of classical fitness (the expression of an individual's success of passing on its genes to future generations, DAWKINS, 1982). Body size of male and female Lariophagus may vary over about the same range, but, on average, males are distinctly smaller than females. Sex ratio theory has generated a number of models which predict in what ways a parasite like Lariophagus will treat hosts of variable size (reject, use for a daughter, use for a son) in order to make the most profitable investments (e.g. CHARNOV, 1979, 1982; WERREN, 1984). Assumptions on size and sex-related differential fitness returns underly these models. Our experiments served as a test of CHARNOV'S (1979) hypothesis, that a smaller size may be less of a disadvantage to males than to females. The results give support to this assumption. Large females produced more offspring than small ones because they were more fecund and because they lived longer; large and small differed by a factor 3. Large males lived about twice as long as small ones. Large males were able to inseminate about twice as many females but successful courtship displays of both categories proved to be of equal duration. In competitive situations large males were about 1.2 times more successful to court and copulate first, 1.4 times more successful in stealing a copulation and about twice as successful in obtaining an exclusive copulation without any prior investment in courtship behaviour. Small males were less successful than large ones in avoiding sperm competition; difference were in the order of a factor 2.

KEITH HARRISON Biological Sciences/Institute of Animal Behavior, Towson State University, Towson, Maryland 21204, U.S.A. 1. Male spring peepers exhibit individual variation in calling persistence within as well as between nights. 2. Weather conditions influence nightly variation in calling persistence throughout the reproductive season, but there is a pronounced decrease in calling persistence late in the season which appears to be independent of climate. 3. In four speaker experiments simulating males calling 20, 40, 60, and 80% of the time, there is a positive correlation between time spent calling and mating success.</page><page sequence="167">VOLUME 108 4. On nights when there is significant variation in calling persistence, females likely respond to those males which are most persistent (i.e., produce the most conspicuous calls). 5. In four speaker experiments simulating males calling 80, 85, 90 and 95% of the time, mating success is random, suggesting that during periods of peak mating activity the importance of female choice is diminished. 6. Calling persistence is not correlated with body size, therefore males of any age or size class have an opportunity to experience mating success. 7. Anuran vocalization is known to be energetically expensive, and persistent callers (regardless of their size) are likely in good physical condition. 8. We suggest that by responding (either actively or passively) to the most conspicuous calls, females convey to their offspring an advantage above and beyond that accrued by random mating. Behaviour Vol. 108 (1989) pp. 209-240 DISTANCE REGULATION OF HAND-REARED GOSLINGS (ANSER INDICUS) TO AN UNRESPONSIVE PARENT: A STUDY OF THE SHORT-TERM DYNAMICS OF ATTACHMENT JURG LAMPRECHT Max-Planck-Institut fur Verhaltensphysiologie, Seewiesen, D-8130 Starnberg, F.R.G. This study investigated the ways in which young goslings contribute to the proximity between parent and offspring in geese. It sought to detect the rules governing excursions of hand-reared goslings (Anser indicus) from a stationary and non-responding human 'parent' on a large lawn. Distance to the parent and behaviours (distress calling, feeding and others) were monitored during 149 30-min-sessions of 28 goslings (7-19 days old), most of which were accompanied in some sessions by a sibling. Of two additional experiments, one demonstrated the positive effect of sibling group size on maximum distance from the parent, the other showed that distress calling induced by forced separation from the (human) parent was reduced by the presence of siblings. Excursion analysis revealed that the probability of returning to the parent was independent of time and distance. This allowed rejection of some earlier models of excursion control. Only sudden disturbances in the environment (occurring at random with respect to the start of an excursion), forced separation from the parent, and-similarly-the parent's walking away were found to elicit approach to the parent. The speed of leaving the parent was also independent of time and distance. Thus distance was not limited by an increasing locomotor tendency to return. But rate of distress calling increased with distance. Two causes for the goslings' departures were identified: 1) parental non-signalling (by the "mute" parent), which aroused a tendency "to go home", and 2) hunger combined with the tendency to forage in a fixed direction. Return probability, speed of leaving and distress call rate at any given distance were lower when a gosling was accompanied by a sibling, apparently because the social feedback received from the sibling compensated for the parent's non-signalling. In spite of behavioural tendencies which lead a gosling to potentially unlimited distances from its parents, it will not normally get lost, as it returns whenever alarmed or when the parents walk away, and because goose parents tend to join a gosling distress calling at a distance. Behaviour Vol. 108 (1989) pp. 241-261 ONTOGENY OF ULTRASONIC VOCALIZATIONS IN THE WOODMOUSE (APODEMUS SYLVATICUS L.). I: TEMPORAL ORGANIZATION ANDRE PONTET, MARCEL GYGER and FRAN(OISE SCHENK Institut de Physiologie, 7, rue du Bugnon, CH-1011, Lausanne, Switzerland We have studied the ontogeny of ultrasonic vocalizations in the woodmouse, Apodemus sylvaticus, a high vocalizing palearctic murid species. Vocalization and behaviour were recorded as the pups were daily isolated for three minutes at ambiant temperature in two different experimental conditions: a plus-maze and a cup. The temporal organization of the vocalizations was analysed using log survivor functions of the intervals between the calls. These functions provided a reliable bout criterion indicating that ultrasound production by the youngest pups was clustered in bouts. Ontogenetic changes in the ultrasound production appeared different when measured in calls or in bouts per time unit. The call rate decreases from PND 11 onwards, whereas the bout rate remains elevated up to PND 15. Ultrasound production and locomotor 809</page><page sequence="168">VOLUME 108 activity are associated from PND 11 onwards. The high ultrasound production by two-week old pups in the plus-maze is related to a very high locomotor activity in this experimental condition. We have identified four different steps in the ontogeny of ultrasonic vocalizations in the woodmouse: 1) Just after birth, the pups emit very few ultrasounds. 2) Around PND 3, there is a tremendous vocal output: the pups vocalize in a tonic mode, almost continuously. 3) The tonic mode goes gradually into a phasic mode in which ultrasounds are clustered in bouts; the total production decreases as the pups grow up. From PND 11 onward, most of the calls are produced during locomotion. 4) Around PND 15 there are mainly single calls, like in the adults. The very intense and frequent calls emitted during the second step are known to be distress calls. Since their production is accompanied by a high muscular activity, that might also delay cooling of the pups. The calls emitted by two-week old pups might serve as contact calls increasing the cohesion between the pups at the time of the first excursions out of the nest. In this way, these calls might diminish the predation risk and would facilitate a possible protection or retrieval by the mother. Behaviour Vol. 108 (1989) pp. 262-296 DANGEROUS LIONS AND NONCHALANT BUFFALO H.H.T. PRINS Zool. Laboratory, University of Groningen, P.O.Box 14, 9750 AA Haren (Gr.), The Netherlands G.R. IASON Dept. of Zoology, University of Aberdeen, Tillydrone Avenue, Aberdeen, AB9 2TN U.K. 1. Aspects of the influence of predation on the African buffalo Syncerus caffer were studied in Lake Manyara National Park, northern Tanzania, from 1981 to 1985. 2. During the study period, predation by lions was the most important cause of death in buffalo but occasionally major epidemics, such as rinderpest, can be by far the most important cause of death. 3. A comparison of Manyara with four other areas in Africa shows that the Manyara buffalo ran the same level of risk as those in these other areas, and that in periods in which epidemics or drought conditions are absent it was normal that ultimately some 90% of the large herbivores fell victim to predation. 4. Juvenile mortality in females was higher than in males but adult mortality in females was lower than in males. Adult bulls ran a much higher risk to be killed by lions (12.9% p.a.) than herd-living buffalo (4.4% p.a.); the latter category comprised cows and sub-adult bulls. 5. Risk of predation was highest near the ecotone between grasslands and structurally closed vegetations. Grasslands were as dangerous as woodlands and thickets, and only the mudflats were really safe. The chance to be killed fell steeply away from (potential) cover for lions. 6. Buffalo were more vigilant at night than during the day, peripheral animals more so than central ones. Adult bulls were more vigilant than other categories of buffalo. It is concluded that vigilance in buffalo was not restricted to predator detection. 7. The choice of feeding areas in buffalo was not dictated by predation risk alone. Behaviour Vol. 108 (1989) pp. 297-324 CONDITION CHANGES AND CHOICE OF SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT IN AFRICAN BUFFALO BULLS H.H.T. PRINS Zoological Laboratory, University of Groningen, Kerklaan 30, 9750 AA Haren (Gr.), The Netherlands 1. The social behaviour of the African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) was studied between 1981 and 1985 in Lake Manyara National Park, northern Tanzania. Emphasis is placed on the relationships between adult bulls (i.e. older than 7 yrs). 2. These bulls were transient members of the buffalo population of the study area. At any time ±150 adult bulls were in the area. During the study period 240 individual bulls were recognized, and the number of the 'bull pool' during this period was estimated to be 630. 3. Every few weeks, the bulls switched between the herd state and bachelor state, and wandered from herd to herd, presumably in search of oestrus cows. 4. They did not form stable associations, and when bachelor, they preferentially associated in temporary groups of 3 to 5 bulls. 5. Adult bulls engaged in sparring and showed dominance interactions very rarely. In a dyadic encounter, dominance interactions were only observed between bulls of the same body condition. Encounters involv- 810</page><page sequence="169">VOLUME 108 811 ing individuals in different condition resulted in dominance being established without interaction. Fighting is extremely rare and likely to be lethal to both opponents. 6. The switching between both social environments was related to condition loss in the mixed herd and to condition gain in the bachelor state. This resulted in a 'rotating dominance hierarchy'. The bachelor phase is an essential part of the breeding cycle of an adult bull. 7. The necessity of a bachelor phase to recoup body condition may well be a general feature in mammalian species with long breeding seasons.</page><page sequence="170">812 VOLUME 109 Behaviour Vol. 109 (1989) pp. 1-19 PARTNER ATTACK INHIBITION IN THE SEXUALLY MONOMORPHIC BIPARENTAL CICHLID TILAPIA MARIAE GEORGE F.

Pair formation successfully occurred when the female had prior residence in the tank, and could occur within a few minutes. Dominant females generally had priority of access to males. In the experiment where pairing occurred, dominant females and males showed practically no overt aggression towards each other. In the confines of a small tank, with no other subordinate conspecifics present, male and female T mariae did show aggression to one another, but in this case courtship behaviour was entirely absent. Closed-fin postures were employed by both sexes of Tilapia mariae in the early stages of courtship: it is suggested that these served as 'Partner Attack Inhibition' displays. Submissive displays of the kind employed in agonistic encounters are not used in courtship. Behaviour Vol. 109 (1989) pp. 20-45 A PHONOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF MALE GIBBON SINGING BEHAVIOR JOHN C. MITANI and PETER MARLER The Rockefeller University, Field Research Center, Millbrook, New York 12545, U.S.A. Acoustic analyses and experimental field playbacks were conducted to investigate the nature and com- municative significance of the phonological structure and organization of male gibbon (Hylobates agilis) songs. Males use a limited number of spectrographically discrete elements or note types to construct songs. A classification of these note types was produced initially through a visual sorting process using gross spectral and temporal features. Measurement of single acoustic variables and a digital sound pro- gram, which compared the two-dimensional cross-correlation values of note spectrograms, were employed to check the results of the qualitative sorting procedure. The sequential organization of notes composing songs was examined by tabulating the frequencies of occurrence of each note type in different positions and the transition probabilities between note types. These analyses revealed that songs are formed within a framework of rules, which define regular patterns in the placement and order of note types. To investigate whether the gibbons employ these rules in a biologically meaningful fashion, a field playback experiment was conducted comparing the responses of animals to normal and phonologically rearranged songs. Although the gibbons identify rearranged songs as conspecific territorial signals, responses to playbacks suggested that the hypothesized rules generating songs are communicatively significant; male gibbons responded in a qualitatively different fashion to normal and phonologically rearranged songs. These results are evaluated in light of other studies of animal vocal communication. Behaviour Vol. 109 (1989) pp. 46-57 LABORATORY AND FIELD STUDIES OF THE EFFECT OF PREDATION RISK ON FORAGING IN THREE-SPINED STICKLEBACKS (GASTEROSTEUS ACULEATUS) A.A. IBRAHIM and EA. HUNTINGFORD Zoology Department, Glasgow University, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Scotland This article describes a series of experiments carried out in both field and laboratory on the effects of predators on foraging in threespined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus). In a field experiment on habitat use, predation risk did not cause the fish to abandon their preference for vegetated habitat, but led them to increase the use of the lake bed. However, in the presence of a predator, the fish still fed mainly on zooplankton rather than on benthos. In a field experiment on diet choice, predation risk suppressed the amount of food eaten and caused a shift to different prey species and smaller prey. In a laboratory experiment, predation risk slowed the response to the food and caused the fish to cease discrimination in favour of the more profitable food items. The number of feeding attempts was not affected, which could mean that the fish were compensating for their slow start by a higher subsequent rate of bites once feeding began. Thus, predation risk affected the foraging behaviour in such a way that energetic intake was reduced in the interest of predator avoidance.</page><page sequence="171">VOLUME 109 813 Behaviour Vol. 109 (1989) pp. 58-75 MATE CHOICE, MATE GUARDING AND OTHER MATING TACTICS IN GOLDEN HAMSTERS MAINTAINED UNDER SEMINATURAL CONDITIONS ROBERT D. LISK, U. WILLIAM HUCK, ANDREA C. GORE and MICHAEL X. ARMSTRONG Department of Biology, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey 08544, U.S.A. Female hamsters freely interacting with a triad of males which had established a dominance hierarchy mated first and received more ejaculates from the dominant male in 11 of 15 replicates. Continuous observations of the animals on the day preceding receptivity and the day of receptivity suggest that differential mating success of the dominant males is the result of differential behavioral responses displayed prior to onset of receptivity. The females attacked all males, however, the dominant males persisted in following and licking the female at significantly higher frequencies than the subordinate males. The females responded differentially to the dominant males by vaginal marking in response to being licked and also on day 3 of the cycle by placing a higher number of vaginal marks in and around the dominant male's home area. In nine replicates the dominant male and female slept together on day 3. In two other cases the dominant male dug open the female's burrow early on day 4. Dominant males and females became active significantly earlier than subordinate males on day 4. Thus, dominant males enhanced their chances of mating both by being active earlier and by sleeping in proximity to the female. Males cannot prevent the promiscuous female from mating with another male. However, successful males continued to follow and mount the female during the period when she is likely to accept a second male. At this time they also display a high level of attack and chases against the subordinate males plus a high frequency of flank marking in the subordinate's home areas. These behaviors suggest a mate guarding function and are consistent with protection of the male's sperm investment. Behaviour Vol. 109 (1989) pp. 76-124 ON THE ONTOGENY OF DISPLAY BEHAVIOUR IN THE BLACK-HEADED GULL: I. THE GRADUAL EMERGENCE OF THE ADULT FORMS TON GROOTHUIS Zoological Laboratory, University of Groningen, P.O. Box 14, 9750 AA Haren, The Netherlands The central question in this paper concerns the mechanism by which displays develop their species-specific stereotyped form. To this end the ontogeny of display behaviour in the black-headed gull was studied in birds kept and raised in aviaries. First it was analyzed whether the complete adult form of the display is present early in the chick, or whether it develops gradually over a longer period. Second, to answer the question whether experience with incomplete forms of display is necessary to develop the complete form, the normal display development was manipulated. The descriptive part of the results deals with a detailed quantitative description of the form development in 3 agonistic displays: choking, oblique and forward, and with the development of the begging display. Data are presented concerning: ontogenetic changes in frequency of several form elements of postures and vocalizations, changes in their combinations, changes in duration of displays and changes in the context and sequences of displays. The development of these displays is summarized in Fig. 2. Choking develops from crouching via incomplete forms of choking. First a choking-like vocalization develops in which the notes are more and more placed in a stereotyped rhythm. This call is performed by young chicks first during crouching, but later almost exclusively during choking-like postures in which the bill points downwards. During ontogeny, these bill-down postures are increasingly performed with extended carpal joints, with a tilted body, with head movements, and while standing and not hiding, in this order. From the age of two weeks on, the young regularly extend the neck upwards while choking. These postures are increasingly performed with a particular modification of the choking-like vocalization, which gradually develops to the adult long-call, typical for the adult oblique display. Two independent sound sources in the vocal apparatus of the gull seem to be involved in the development of the long-call. Early oblique-like postures are often performed with the bill held down, as in choking. Older young perform oblique-like postures more often with bill positions typical for adults, but with the neck held vertically. Young older than 10 weeks often perform normal adult oblique postures. By this time the duration of the postures has increased considerably. The sequence of the oblique with the forward, which is typical for adults, is also regularly seen from this time onwards.</page><page sequence="172">814 VOLUME 109 Begging consists of a rapid up-and-down movement of the head; during every downward movement a specific call is uttered. In very young chicks, this display is hardly distinguishable from the alert posture. During ontogeny, the duration of the pumping bouts increases, while the form changes. This change in form is due to the fact that the incomplete form of the forward becomes integrated in the begging display, while this posture also changes in form. This integration of the alert and the incomplete form of the forward is reflected by the fact that in the begging display both the call typical for the alert posture, and the call typical for the incomplete forward posture, is given. The forward develops by a gradual lowering of the head and a more pronounced extension of the neck, while the carpal joints are increasingly raised. Adult gulls often perform the posture with an upward pointed bill and a bent in the neck. In accord with data from the literature it was found that under special conditions the young chick is capable of performing adult display. As a rule, however, before the tenth week of age, young gulls show incomplete forms of display. All species-specific adult displays, postures as well as vocalizations, develop gradually towards a more complete and pronounced form. This process takes place by addition of new form elements to already existing combinations, and by changes in the form of some elements. A display can also be built upon elements of another display. Nevertheless, the development of the form of the displays cannot be attributed to an increasing amount of coordination of the different elements; only the expression of the complete pattern increases with age. For the occurrence of one form element of an adult display in the precursor display of the chick is positively correlated with the occurrence of other such elements in that incomplete display. This already is the case early in ontogeny, before the complete form is regularly performed. The adult displays are not completely fixed in their form, and the variability in some displays of adults is of the same order as in the chick. The second part of this paper deals with an experiment in which the normal course of the development of display behaviour was manipulated. Since the displays seem to develop during social interactions with parents (the begging display) or with intruders on the territory (the agonistic displays), young birds are raised in small groups with conspecifics of the same age. Agonistic- and begging interactions in these groups are rare an the development of display behaviour, both in frequency and in form, is retarded. Based on the frequency of overt aggression and on the plumage of the birds, it is likely that in these birds also the development of agonistic behaviour and the testosterone production is retarded. At the age of 15 weeks, these birds are confronted with unknown conspecifics. Although the frequency of the displays increases during the test, the form of the postures still appears to be incomplete; the birds do not seem to be able to perform complete display postures at an age at which normally raised birds perform complete display very often. Based on the data of both the descriptive study as well as the experiment, possible mechanisms for the development of display behaviour are discussed. The main items are: "imitation"; "matching" on the basis of feedback of the performed display via reactions of conspecifics or proprioceptive information and development of motivational factors including testosterone. This discussion lays the basis for a series of experiments which will be reported separately. Behaviour Vol. 109 (1989) pp. 125-141 INFLUENCES ON THE CHOICE BETWEEN TERRITORIAL AND SATELLITE BEHAVIOUR IN MALE LIBELLULA QUADRIMACULATA LINN. (ODONATA: LIBELLULIDAE) PETER CONVEY Department of Zoology, University of Cambridge, Downing St., Cambridge, CB2 3EJ, England Territorial behaviour of male Libellula quadrimaculata Linn, was investigated at Wicken Fen, Cam- bridgeshire, in 1986. Males were intensely territorial, expelling any other males that flew into their territory. Territories were defended for the mating opportunities that they provided. As local population density increased a number of males adopted satellite behaviour, although most continued to behave ter- ritorially. Wingspan and hindwing length were significantly larger in satellites than in territorial males. The likelihood of satellite behaviour was not related to male age. There was also no difference in age be- tween satellite-host pairs in which both individuals were of known age. Satellite males were not observed to mate successfully, though they did not suffer the costs associated with territorial defense. A series of removal experiments demonstrated that the satellites could take over a territory and behave aggressively to other males. Scaling factors may have an important function in forcing larger males to adopt the less successful satellite role. Notably, flight muscle content was lower than expected in larger individuals, which should result in lower power output per unit body weight, and thus lower maximum acceleration manoeuverability.</page><page sequence="173">VOLUME 109 815 Behaviour Vol. 109 (1989) pp. 142-162 THE VOCAL REPERTOIRE OF ADULT TREE SHREWS (TUPAJA BELANGERI) H. BINZ and E. ZIMMERMANN Department of Zoology, University of Stuttgart-Hohenheim, 7000 Stuttgart 70, F.R.G. The adult vocal repertoire of T belangeri consists of 8 distinct sounds which are organized into a graded system. Within the repertoire 4 basic acoustic structures have been distinguished which can be associated with one of the following functional categories: contact, aggression, defence, attention and alarm; Elements repeated continually at short regular intercall intervals showing narrow frequency band spectra occur during courtship and mating in males; Elements of short duration with harmonic spectra, low fundamentals and often low frequency noise components signal alarm which consequently focuses other individuals' attention on the sender or the external stimulus; Elements of irregular repetition rate showing broadband harmonic spectra of highly variable duration and frequency modulation are associated with the vocalizers defensive behavior; Elements with noisy spectra over a wide frequency range parallel aggressive behavior by the vocalizer which is often intensified with visual threat display. The findings of the present study are compared and discussed with data from literature referring to tupaia vocalizations. A comparison with the call system of insectivores and prosimians revealed similarities as well as divergencies. Presence of many similarities regarding the basic structural patterning of contact, aggressive and defensive vocalizations in the three orders indicates a certain conservatism in these sounds. Propagation of alarm calls in tree shrews which lacks in insectivores appears to be a more recent evolutionary development in mammals with the highest degree of elaboration in primates. Behaviour Vol. 109 (1989) pp. 163-175 THE EFFECTS OF CROSS-FOSTERING ON SELECTIVE SONG LEARNING IN ESTRILDID FINCHES N.S. CLAYTON Department of Biology and Preclinical Medicine, University of St. Andrews, Fife KY16 9TS, Scotland Male zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, which have been cross-fostered to Bengalese finches, Lonchura striata, learn Bengalese finch song elements with as much accuracy as a male learning from his natural father. However, these elements are sung in phrases which are more nearly zebra finch length and lack the repetitiveness typical of the elements in a Bengalese finch phrase. Male Bengalese finches are also capable of learning song from a zebra finch foster-father. Males vary substantially but they tend to produce fewer, more widely spaced zebra finch elements in a Bengalese finch-length phrase. Both species show selective song learning and it is suggested that phrase length and the absence or presence of repeated elements might act as important cues for species-specific learning. Cross-fostered Bengalese finches seem to learn less than cross-fostered zebra finches: possible reasons for this are discussed. Behaviour Vol. 109 (1989) pp. 176-190 FUNCTIONS OF ALLIANCES IN CONTESTS WITHIN WILD GORILLA GROUPS A.H. HARCOURT Large Animal Research Group, Dept. of Zoology, 34a Storey's Way, Cambridge, CB3 ODT, U.K. K.J. STEWART Sub-Dept. of Animal Behaviour, University of Cambridge, Madingley, Cambridge CB3 8AA, U.K. Primates frequently support other individuals in aggressive contests among group members. Several functions of such alliances have been suggested, some of them dependent on continued residence of females in the group of their birth. The distribution of alliances in the gorilla (Gorilla gorilla), in which both sexes emigrate, was analysed to investigate constraints on the use of alliances by primates. Functions were inferred on the basis of the identity of participants, it being assumed, for example, that a mother supported its infant against an adolescent male for a different reason than did an adolescent female who supported a dominant female against a subordinate female. Gorillas ally, we suggest, to protect relatives from harm, to provide them with access to otherwise unob- tainable resources and, perhaps, to emphasise their dominance over rivals; it seems that individuals might also ally to obtain resources for themselves, and to establish supportive relationship with other group members. The first two inferred functions were the most common, involved in over 80% of alliances.</page><page sequence="174">816 VOLUME 109 The major contrast with female-resident primates lay not so much in the range of functions for which al- liances were used, but in the lack of evidence that gorillas attempted to use alliances to manipulate the dominance status of their kin. Possible reasons for the contrast are that i) the widespread distribution and low quality of the gorilla's main food plants meant that ability in defence competition was not sufficiently advantageous for the benefits of raising the rank of kin to outweigh the costs; ii) the large difference in age among immature gorillas in the study area, which was mostly a consequence of the small group size, made it too costly to use support in contests to raise an individual's rank above that of older peers; iii) the leading male prevented the unequal investment among his offspring that would be entailed if individuals used alliances in contests to raise or reinforce the rank of kin. Currently, these possibilities cannot be distinguished. Behaviour Vol. 109 (1989) pp. 191-199 VOCAL LEARNING OF JAPANESE AND RHESUS MONKEYS NOBUO MASATAKA and KAZUO FUJITA Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University, Inuyama, Aichi 484, Japan Foraging vocalizations given by Japanese and rhesus monkeys reared by their biological mothers differed from each other in a single parameter. Calls made by a Japanese monkey fostered by a rhesus female were dissimilar to those of conspecifics reared by their biological mothers, but similar to those of rhesus monkeys reared by their biological mothers, and the vocalizations given by rhesus monkeys fostered by Japanese monkey mothers were dissimilar to those of conspecifics reared by their biological mothers, but similar to those of Japanese monkeys reared by their biological mothers. Playback experiments revealed that both Japanese and rhesus monkeys distinguished between the calls of Japanese monkeys reared by their biological mothers and of the cross-fostered rhesus monkeys on one hand, and the vocalizations of rhesus monkeys reared by their biological mothers and of the cross-fostered Japanese monkey on the other hand. Thus, production of species-specific vocalizations was learned by each species, and it was the learned species-difference which the monkeys themselves discriminated. Behaviour Vol. 109 (1989) pp. 200-221 SATELLITES AND TRANSIENTS: ECOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS ON ALTERNATIVE MATING TACTICS IN MALE GRASSHOPPERS TODD E. SHELLY Hawaiian Evolutionary Biology Program, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, HI 96822, U.S.A. MICHAEL D. GREENFIELD Department of Biology, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90024, U.S.A. Alternative tactics of male mating behaviour, broadly classifiable as "dominant/territorial" versus "subordinate/non-territorial" have now been described for numerous species. Furthermore, across di- verse taxa the mating tactics of subordinate/non-territorial males often appear as one of two distinct types, satellite or transient behaviour. Despite general recognition of this dichotomy, though, little effort has been made to identify the circumstances under which one of these behaviours is adopted over the other. We compared the mating systems of two congeneric species of desert grasshoppers (genus Ligurotettix) to investigate specifically the role of resource dispersion in shaping the behaviour of subordinate males. The utility of the comparative approach derives from two basic similarities between the species: both Ligurotettix coquilletti and Ligurotettix planum feed almost exclusively on a single host plant species, and the majority of males in both species defend individual host plants to gain access to females. However, the two species are associated with host plants that are dispersed very differently; i.e., L. coquilletti encounter a small number of large plants and L. planum a large number of small ones. In L. coquilletti, subordinate males, individuals noted by their lack of success in aggression and in obtaining matings, were characterized as satellites that remained silent on host plants defended by territorial males. Subordinate males in L. planum, however, were transients that sang regularly but moved frequently among different host plants. We propose that this behavioural discrepancy results from (1) the large difference between the number of potential female encounter sites (i.e., individual host plants) available to the males of the two species and (2) the large difference between the sizes of resource patches defended by the two species, which influences the ability of dominant males to eject subordinates.</page><page sequence="175">VOLUME 109 817 Behaviour Vol. 109 (1989) pp. 222-234 BENEFITS, COSTS, AND DETERMINANTS OF DOMINANCE IN AMERICAN BLACK DUCKS GARY R. HEPP U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, Laurel, MD 20708, U.S.A. Behavioural dominance was studied in captive American black ducks (Anas rubripes) during October- December 1984. Eighty ducks were marked individually, and groups of 10 ducks consisting of 5 adults (3 males and 2 females) and 5 juveniles (3 males and 2 females) were assigned to each of 8 experimental pens. Ducks in 4 pens received an ad libitum diet, and ducks in the other 4 pens were given a restricted diet. Dominance structure within pens was linear. Adults were dominant to young, and body mass had no influence on dominance rank. The effect of sex on dominance rank was age-specific. Adult males were dominant to adult females and to young black ducks ducks of both sexes; however, dominance rank of young males did not differ from adult or young females. Paired adults were dominant to unpaired adults and to young individuals that were either paired or unpaired. Paired young black ducks were similar in dominance rank to unpaired adults and unpaired young indicating that pairing did not make these individuals more dominant. Ducks on the restricted diet gained less body mass than ducks on the ad libitum diet (HEPP, 1986), but dominant and subordinate black ducks within treatment groups experienced similar changes in body mass during the early winter. Dominant black ducks interacted more frequently and were more likely to form pair bonds than subordinates, thus higher energy costs of dominant individuals may explain the poor relationship between physical condition and dominance rank. There was a significant positive association between the dominance ranks of pair members. Behaviour Vol. 109 (1989) pp. 235-246 ASSESSMENTS AND DECISIONS DURING MATE CHOICE IN GAMMARUS PULEX (AMPHIPODA) JAIMIE T.A. DICK and ROBERT W. ELWOOD Department of Zoology, The Queen's University of Belfast, Belfast BT7 INN, Northern Ireland, U.K. Male Gammarus pulex preferentially enter precopulatory mate guarding with large females close to moult- ing. The interactions of males and females were observed in an attempt to elucidate the process by which males assess females and, further, to determine how such information gathering influences mating deci- sions. Males which encountered single females, which had recently been experimentally separated from other males, grabbed and held those females in a perpendicular hold prior to establishing the precopu- latory hold. The higher the reproductive quality of the female the more rapid was the male decision to move into the perpendicular hold but this was followed by an increased level of abdomen flexing and an- tennae touching. Once precopula was established, higher quality females received more stroking with the free gnathopods. When two females were encountered, some males simply took the first contacted and this resulted in random pairing. Other males, however, demonstrated the ability to sequentially sample as well as simultaneously compare females and, if this occurred, they almost invariably took the higher quality female. Discrimination between two females was more rapid as the difference in their qualities in- creased whereas males engaged in more grabbing and holding when females were of similar moult stages. The data show that assessment of female size and moult stage occurs early in the interaction, whereas subsequent activities such as flexing and stroking are probably involved in courtship, possibly serving to pacify females.

CATCHPOLE Department of Ornithology and Mammalogy, California Academy of Sciences, Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, California, U.S.A. A series of playback experiments was carried out to determine whether territorial male song sparrows could discriminate between their own species song, and the same song produced by a white-crowned sparrow.</page><page sequence="176">818 VOLUME 109 In two out of three measures of response, the males did not discriminate between model and mimic song. In constrast, most males showed no response to control white-crowned sparrow song, although two individuals showed a strong interspecific response. Other examples of interspecific aggression were also detected during the experiments. The results are discussed in relation to recent studies on interspecific song learning and the competition hypothesis of vocal mimicry in songbirds. Behaviour Vol. 109 (1989) pp. 258-284 FIRING ACTIVITY OF THE WEAKLY-ELECTRIC FISH MARCUSENIUS MACROLEPIDOTUS (MORMYRIDAE, TELEOSTEI): LOGARITHMIC REPARTITION OF INTER-PULSE INTERVALS, AND SEQUENTIAL INEQUALITY TESTING CHRISTIAN GRAFF Laboratoire de Physiologie Nerveuse, Dpt de Neurophysiologie Sensorielle, C.N.R.S., 91190 Gif sur Yvette, France The electric activity of mormyrid fish consists of short electric pulses, all identical, but separated by variable time intervals (inter-pulse interval or IPI). Temporal structures are here extracted from the sequence of IPIs, to show non-randomness in mormyrid electric signal. The electric activity of isolated Marcusenius macrolepidotus is comparable to that of other mormyrids. The pulse waveform is biphasic and symmetrical, it lasts 0.3 to 0.5 ms and its amplitude is about 13 volts. The pulses follow each other with extremely variable IPIs (14-500 ms) with large instantaneous variations. Two new methods of analysis have been developed here. The first is based on the fact that when IPIs are grouped in populations, longer IPI populations have a wider range than shorter ones, a lognormal rather than a normal distribution. The IPIs are therefore classified according not to absolute- but to relative differences: binwidths are in percent, not in milliseconds. The second, non-parametric method (sequential inequality testing), was first used for neurone firing activity. It considers the sign (+ or -) of the difference between successive IPIs, and compares the sequence of these signs with a theoretical random model. When M. macrolepidotus is resting, the sequence of longer and shorter IPIs is not random, as shown by redundancies of patterns of + and - signs. These redundancies and the IPI populations are typical for each individual. When the fish increases its locomotor activity (either spontaneously for a few seconds, or provoked over more than 20 s) the IPIs are shorter. The patterns of + and - are different when the fish is swimming and when resting. Behavioral and electrophysiological data suggest that receiving conspecifics may recognize these rhythm features. The analysis methods developed here may be useful to other stochastic phenomena, such as neural firing activity. Behaviour Vol. 109 (1989) pp. 285-302 MOTIVATIONAL MODELS OF COURTSHIP IN MALE THREESPINE STICKLEBACKS (GASTEROSTEUS ACULEATUS) STEPHEN S. CRAWFORD and PATRICK W. COLGAN Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada K7L 3N6 The objective of this study was to determine which of the Random, Competition, and Time-sharing models provides the best description of courtship in the male threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). A critical re-evaluation of experiments in this field revealed both theoretical and methodological difficulties. An attempt was made to correct these problems and provide a more quantitative and statistically valid approach to the motivational study of behavioural switching. Eighteen subjects were tested over four stimulus conditions in a modified double-interruption experiment, where they alternated between courtship and nest-related behaviour. The animals were visually presented with one or three females, with or without eggs in the nest. Assessments of motivational 'dominance' were made on the basis of incomplete visits and variation of visit duration. Data on time budgets, and temporal variability and associations were also analyzed. The results provided little support for the Competition model. In 33 of the 36 sessions, the Random model was accepted as a logical default when the various methods of assessment failed to support, or contradicted the Time-sharing model. The remaining assessments of Time-sharing (both female- and nest-dominant) may be considered as artefacts of the assessment procedure. Four possible explanations of these results were discussed with respect to experimental design and motivational theory.</page><page sequence="177">VOLUME 109 819 Behaviour Vol. 109 (1989) pp. 303-318 BENEFITS OF COURTSHIP-FEEDING FOR RIFLEMAN (ACANTHISITTA CHLORIS) PARENTS GREG SHERLEY Edward Percival Field Station, University of Canterbury, Kaikoura, New Zealand 1. Courtship-feeding was studied in riflemen (Acanthisitta chloris) in a population at Kaikoura, South Island, New Zealand between 1982 and 1984. The proportion of the food males collected which was donated to his mate was calculated and what proportion of the female's diet this represented. This information revealed that males made a significant early season contribution to parental care. 2. Allied information collected during the pre-lay and egg-laying periods included the time to form eggs, laying interval and clutch size. 3. Courtship-feeding in riflemen involved no ceremony. 4. Copulation attempts did not correspond with bouts courtship-feeding or the peak of courtship-feeding. 5. Pairs spent 91.2% of daylight hours in each other's company, which facilitated courtship-feeding. 6. Food items delivered in courtship-feeding were significantly larger than those eaten by males or females while foraging for themselves, and larger food items were consistently offered throughout the pre-laying and egg-laying periods. 7. The peak in the volume of food delivered to the female occurred about 3.5 days after the first egg was laid. 8. Overall the male contributed 42% of the food he gathered to the female and this comprised 35% of her total food intake. 9. Females fed themselves enough food to meet maintenance requirements and the extra required for oogenesis was received from the male through courtship-feeding and any reserves stored by the female. 10. Riflemen laid eggs every 48 hours which probably reduced peak energy demands during oogenesis. 1. Courtship-feeding was not associated with second clutches which were significantly smaller than the first clutch laid and reared in a season. 12. Incubation occurred after the last egg was laid but was sometimes delayed. During the delay courtship- feeding.continued until incubation started. 13. Courtship-feeding represents a significant early season investment by male riflemen in their offspring which probably allows time to rear two broods thereby improving both parents' productivity. Such early season investment might influence sexual selection towards stable, monogamous pair bonds.</page><page sequence="178">820 VOLUME 110 Behaviour Vol. 110 (1989) pp. 1-22 COPULATIONS AND MATE GUARDING OF THE SPOONBILL (PLATALEA LEUCORODIA) EDUARDO AGUILERA and FERNANDO ALVAREZ Estacion Biologica de Doniana, E-41013 Sevilla, Spain Copulatory behaviour and mate guarding of spoonbills (Platalea leucorodia) nesting at Doinana National Park (SW Spain) were studied during two breeding seasons. Pair copulations were most frequent during the prelaying phase of the female, with a peak on the day before the first egg was laid. Most of the paired males (60%, N = 25) and females (76%, N = 25) were involved in extra-pair copulation attempts (EPCA) and, overall, 19 per cent of the copulation attempts recorded were EPCAs, the targets being primarily paired females. A hypothesis about the optimization of the use of sperm production by paired males is proposed: males give most of their copulatory attention to their mates during the prelaying phase, the latter's uterovaginal sperm storage glands being in this way filled, and, once this is achieved, males turn their attention towards other females in prelaying phase. Devaluation of the sperm of competitors by means of high copulation frequency, optimization of the seasonal pattern of pair copulations, and intense mate guarding were the primary tactics employed by males in defence of their paternity. Considered that copulations are not completed without collaboration on the part of the female, their permissiveness towards EPCAs during the fertile period suggests advantages to females. Among the hypotheses on benefits of extra-pair copulations to female spoonbills, genetic quality of the offspring may be improved by this behaviour, and females may also benefit from the effects of intense nest vigilance by their mates. Behaviour Vol. 110 (1989) pp. 23-46 INTRASPECIFIC PARASITISM AND NESTING SUCCESS IN THE SOLITARY WASP AMMOPHILA SABULOSA JEREMY FIELD Department of Zoology, University of Cambridge, Downing Street, Cambridge CB2 2EJ, U.K. The nesting behaviour of marked female solitary wasps, Ammophila sabulosa (L.) (Sphecidae), was studied over two seasons at a Norfolk heathland site. Females mass provisioned unicellular nests with 1-5 paralysed caterpillars. Intraspecific parasitism was the major mortality factor before the egg hatched approximately 28% of eggs were destroyed by parasites. Parasites stole caterpillars to provision their own nests, replaced host eggs with their own eggs (brood parasitism), or simply discarded prey from host nests. Hosts were ineffective at preventing parasitism. Individual females both provisioned their own nests and parasitized those of other females. Parasitism usually occurred soon after the previous activity at the host nest. Parasitism events were clumped at certain nests, which were parasitized up to five times each. Once a nest had been brood parasitized, the prey were significantly more likely to be stolen or discarded than were prey in unparasitized nests, and only 17% of eggs laid by brood parasites survived. Circumstantial evidence suggests that chemical stimuli are important in detection of host nests by parasites. High levels of intraspecific parasitism have rarely been reported in solitary wasps and bees, and parasitic behaviour is rare and unspecialized in some other Ammophila species. Parasitism by miltogrammine flies was of relatively minor importance in A. sabulosa as in other Ammophila species, probably because provisioning events, during which flies larviposit, are few and well separated in time.

TELFORD and JOHN VAN SICKLE Department of Biological Sciences, University of Zimbabwe, PO Box MP 167, Harare, Zimbabwe Males employed two reproductive tactics: amplexus displacement and vocal advertisement. Outcomes of amplexus displacement attempts could be predicted from body sizes of competing males alone. Mating was non-random and size-selective, but not size-assortative. There was no evidence of female choice based on male body size. Male mating success and body size were positively correlated, although the relationship between success and multiple size measures was complex. There was no trend, over a sequence of chorus nights, in the total number of males calling, but larger males generally entered the breeding assemblages earlier and participated in more choruses. After entering their first chorus, males tended to call for an unbroken sequence of nights. Males entering the most choruses achieved the most matings. There was a weak negative correlation between time spent calling and mating success, and the mean duration of calling events was less for those that led to mating than for those that did not; these results may well have been due to the large proportion of matings achieved through amplexus displacement rather than vocal advertisement. The major proximate mechanisms contributing to the mating system relate to chorus participation; larger males arrived at the breeding site first, participated in more choruses, and achieved the greatest number of matings. The advantage enjoyed by large males in the amplexus displacement process may have been the ultimate determinant of their mating success, especially since female choice was not size-selective. Behaviour Vol. 110 (1989) pp. 76-92 PARENTAL CARE IN THE SUBSOCIAL INTERTIDAL BEETLE, BLEDIUS SPECTABILIS, IN RELATION TO PARASITISM BY THE ICHNEUMONID WASP, BARYCNEMIS BLEDIATOR T.D. WYATT and W.A. FOSTER Department of Zoology, University of Cambridge, Downing Street, Cambridge, CB2 3EJ, U.K. The parasitic wasp Barycnemis blediator (Aubert) is an important natural enemy of the subsocial saltmarsh beetle Bledius spectabilis Kratz: the wasp occurs at high densities (up to 100 coccoons m-2), it is very widely distributed among the beetle colonies, and life-table analysis shows that up to 15% of the immature stages can be killed by the wasp. To determine whether the mother beetle can protect her young against parasitism, we recorded in the field the reactions of individual wasp to burrows that contained either a single adult beetle, an adult and young (the larvae leave the maternal burrow about halfway through the 1st instar) or individual 1st, 2nd or 3rd instars. The wasps only went down those burrows that contained a single, post-dispersal Bledius larva, except once in 132 observations when a wasp was observed to go down a maternal burrow containing a female, eggs and larvae. On all other occasions, burrows containing adult Bledius were not entered by the wasp. None of the five hundred 1st instar larvae collected from maternal burrows in the field was parasitized. This was not because 1st instars in maternal burrows are</page><page sequence="180">822 VOLUME 110 unattractive or unsuitable for the wasp: field experiments showed that the wasps were highly successful in parasitizing 1st instar larvae taken from maternal burrows and placed in experimental burrows. Field experiments showed that the success rate of parasitism by the wasp was much higher with 1st instars (94%) than with 2nd (69%) or 3rd (35%) instars. We suggest that an important consequence of parental care in Bledius spectabilis is that the young are protected from attack by the parasitic wasp Barycnemis blediator for most of their most vulnerable phase (the 1st instar).

ALLOWAY and JAMES F. HARE Enrindale College, University of Toronto, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada L5L 1C6 Newly eclosed workers of the frequently enslaved ant species Leptothorax longispinosus were either exposed to conspecific larvae, exposed to larvae of the slave-making parasite Harpagoxenus americanus, or reared in social isolation. In all conditions, the L. longispinosus workers later accepted H. americanus larvae preferentially. This finding indicates that H. americanus larvae are highly attractive to Leptothorax workers and demonstrates that early learning need not to be invoked to account for the acceptance of Harpagoxenus brood by enslaved Leptothorax workers.

We collected data on allogrooming behaviour, gross body contact, and proximity within 1 m during two different periods: from May to August (non-breeding season) and from November to February (breeding season). Hierarchy was linear and not affected by the seasonal change. Allogrooming showed an increase during the non- breeding season that was due to a widening of social relationships. In both periods, grooming received by each animal was strictly related to its rank. Grooming between adjacently-ranked females was more frequent than grooming between distantly-ranked females regardless of season. Proximity within 1 m did not vary between the two periods. Gross body contacts were diversely distributed among individuals in the two periods and increased markedly during the winter breeding season. We conclude that the opposite seasonal change of allogrooming and gross body contact indicates that these behaviours vary independently from each other, and that the environment has an important effect on interfemale social relationships in rhesus monkey groups.

BALDACCINI and ELENA MARIA BEZZI Istituto di Zoologia, Universita di Parma, Via Universita 12-43100 Parma, Italy In a North-eastern area of the Po Valley (Northern Italy), tests on the orientation pattern of sedge warblers during autumn migration were carried out for two consecutive years. It was found that the sedge warblers tested in Emlen funnel cages orientate in a southerly direction, in accordance with the expected migratory line during postnuptial migration. The recorded mean directions are revealed as very similar, at least during the beginning of the night, in both the adults and the young birds. Nevertheless, the orientation of the latter seems to be more disturbed by natural or artificial light sources such as the sunrise, the moonlight or the horizon glow present in the area, and towards which they seem to show a tactic component.</page><page sequence="181">VOLUME 110 823 Owing to the fact that the sunlight at the point of sunset is the only light stimulus which never induced a phototactic response in the juvenile birds, it is possible to presume that the sunset point bearing may be one the orientational cues used by sedge warblers to establish the course of its migratory flight. Behaviour Vol. 110 (1989) pp. 125-145 BEHAVIOURAL PARAMETERS OF VIGILANCE IN THE DWARF MONGOOSE: SOCIAL ACQUISITION OF A SEX-BIASED ROLE 0. ANNE E. RASA Department of Zoology, University of Pretoria, Pretoria 0002, R.S.A. Dwarf mongooses live in matriarchal family groups and possess a highly complex coordinate vigilance system. Parameters of vigilance behaviour such as guarding duration, frequency, sequence, cues mediating guard orientation and exchange, number of guards present and fidelity to guarding sites are described for wild groups and compared, where appropriate, with data from captive ones to determine whether vigilance becomes modified after generations in captivity. Wild and captive groups showed little difference in basic guarding behaviour. Vigilant animals utilise a complex system of vocalisations to indicate predator presence, these varying with the type of predator sighted and mediating group response, which differs with predator type. Guarding is performed almost exclusively by subordinate males in both captive and wild groups. Vigilance behaviour is absent in naive hand-raised animals kept either singly or in pairs and put together in a group at approximately 1 year old. It develops normally, however, in the young of groups containing experienced adults. Several of its characteristic behavioural parameters are postulated as being acquired during juvenile/adult association at guarding sites. The implications of these findings are discussed.

Birds were observed when feeding alone or in the presence of a conspecific. The seeds were either clumped or scattered over a grid drawn on the floor. Analysis of video recordings allows us to separate three different scanning movements: head up, head swaying and head cock. The durations and frequencies of these movements were significantly affected by social context and the type of distribution of seeds. The functional importance of these movements is discussed in relation to data from literature concerning vision in colombiforms. It appears that stationary phases of the head are particularly important to detect both movements and depth. Then a correct modelling of vigilance behaviour should take into account the information content associated with each scan, especially in the case of species still tolerating the presence of a predator after having detected it. In the presence of a conspecific, birds were scanning less frequently than when alone. However, the increase in pecking rate in the presence of a conspecific compared to when feeding alone is not due only to reduced vigilance. Social birds were pecking at a higher rate than when alone between two consecutive scans. This results suggests that competition for a limited resource can be responsible for the observed increased food intake, currently assumed to be a benefit of social feeding in birds.</page><page sequence="182">824 VOLUME 110 Behaviour Vol. 110 (1989) pp. 161-204 ON THE ONTOGENY OF DISPLAY BEHAVIOUR IN THE BLACK-HEADED GULL: II. CAUSAL LINKS BETWEEN THE DEVELOPMENT OF AGGRESSION, FEAR AND DISPLAY BEHAVIOUR: EMANCIPATION RECONSIDERED TON GROOTHUIS Zoological Laboratory, University of Groningen, P.O. Box 14, 9750 AA Haren, The Netherlands In a study of the form development of the species-specific displays in the black-headed gull, a gradual change of these motor patterns was found, as well as a retardation of this change, in birds raised in a situation lacking the normal social context (GROOTHUIS, 1989). In this experimental context, low frequencies of aggressive and fear behaviour were also found. These results have led to the hypothesis that the ontogenetic change of display behaviour is influenced by the development of internal factors for agonistic behaviour. To put this idea to a test, a study was started to investigate the relation between the development of aggressive and fear behaviour and of display behaviour during ontogeny. Standard stimulus experiments, simulating an adult intruder on the territory, were carried out at least once a week during the first 9 weeks of age in groups of territorial, hand-raised birds. The frequencies of two forms of fear behaviour, hiding and escape, and of aggressive pecking gradually increased in this order. The proportion of aggressive behaviour that was immediately followed by withdrawal was high in 2-week old chicks, but decreased considerably with age. The frequency of sudden stops after approach and of incomplete aggressive pecks increased with age, suggesting that overt aggression became more inhibited by fear, resulting in longer lasting interactions with more display behaviour. This interpretation is supported by the finding that stopping as well as sitting occurred in the behavioral chain at the switch between overt aggression and overt escape. The displays gradually changed in frequency and in form, via incomplete ones to the adult complete form. Oblique-, forward- and choking-like postures were almost exclusively performed in an agonistic context, in contrast to the begging display. It is concluded that each of these three agonistic displays develop from postures, dominated by a tendency to escape or to hide, to complete display by an addition of a simultaneously activated tendency to behave aggressively. This is based on: 1. similarities in frequency changes during ontogeny of overt aggressive and fear behaviour on the one hand, and the displays on the other hand; 2. the occurrence of the different displays during sudden stops after aggressive approach, during with- drawal, and in sitting which followed escape and was often followed by aggression; 3. the temporal relationship of the displays with overt aggression and with each other, and differences in this respect between incomplete and complete display; 4. similarity in form of the displays with overt aggressive and fear behaviour. Functional aspects of this development are discussed. The motivation of display in older gulls is studied separately, mainly by analysing normal social interac- tions. The increase in display frequency and decrease in overt aggression and fear during early ontogeny was maintained in later ontogeny. As a consequence, adults hardly showed overt aggressive behaviour. This finding could be explained by assuming an increasing mutual inhibition of each other's overt expres- sion by internal mechanisms controling aggression and fear. However, this explanation could not account for other findings: 1. in contrast to young birds, adults frequently perform display outside agonistic context; 2. in contrast to young, adult birds no longer perform their display during those categories of locomotion for which evidence was obtained that they were caused by a simultaneous activation of aggression and fear; 3. adult gulls perform the oblique-forward sequence simultaneously with those of the opponent. The increase in synchronously performed display during late ontogeny suggests an increasing independence of display of the precise motivational state of the animal. It is concluded that the displays, once developed under the influence of internal factors controlling ag- gressive and fear behaviour, become fixed in form and independent of these factors. It seems as if adult birds may use these motor patterns as a kind of subroutines, applicable in different behavioural programs. If aggression is performed by adults, display is almost always performed also, suggesting that internal factors for agonistic behaviour, when aroused, still control display behaviour. It is suggested therefore that the ontogenetic change in causal organisation of display behaviour in gulls is more adequately described by the term "extension" of motivational factors than by the term "emancipation" of the original ones.</page><page sequence="183">VOLUME 110 825 Behaviour Vol. 110 (1989) pp.205-218 INITIAL ORIENTATION OF ANOSMIC HOMING PIGEONS BASED ON INFORMATION GATHERED AT FAMILIAR RELEASE SITES REMAINS HOMEWARD DIRECTED FOLLOWING CLOCK-SHIFT VERNER P. BINGMAN and PAOLO IOALE Dipartimento di Scienze del Comportamento Animale dell'Universita di Pisa, e Centro per la Faunistica ed Ecologia Tropicali del CNR, Firenze, Italy In addition to their well described map and compass mechanisms, homing pigeons can also rely on information gathered during previous visits to a release site (familiar-site information) to orient home from that location. In the present study, we wished to clarify the nature of the spatial information acquired during visits to a release site. Clock-shifted homing pigeons, rendered anosmic such that they could only rely on familiar-site information to orient homeward, failed to display the typical shift in initial orientation indicative of sun compass use as displayed by controls. This results indicates that familiar-site information can be used not only for recognition of previous visited locations, but also to guide a pigeon's orientation response. However, there was an increase in scatter in the vanishing bearings of clock-shifted pigeons whose initial orientation was based on familiar-site information, suggesting that the solar cues were part of the available familiar-site information. Finally, clock-shifted pigeons who could rely on both their navigational map and familiar-site information for initial orientation behaved in a manner suggesting primary use of their navigational map with additional reference, at least to a limited degree, to familiar-site information. Behaviour Vol. 110 (1989) pp. 219-243 ALTERNATIVE NESTING TACTICS IN A SOLITARY WASP JEREMY FIELD Department of Zoology, University of Cambridge, Downing Street, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, U.K. Nesting tactics of individually marked female solitary wasps, Ammophila sabulosa (L.) (Sphecidae), were studied over two seasons at a Nortfolk heathland site. Females provision unicellular nests with 1-5 paralysed caterpillars. The entire nesting cycle requires approximately 8-10 hours of activity and there is no evidence that nesting success depends on female size. Prey are obtained by hunting or are stolen from other females' nests, which are found by searching in the nesting area. Females search on the nesting area and open other females' nests at significantly later times of day and lower temperatures than those at which they are absent from the nesting area (presumably hunting) and provision hunted prey. This may reflect thermal constraints or changes in prey availability or availability of detectable nests. Hunting and searching are mutually exclusive alternatives, but because females frequently switch between them it is difficult to estimate the time costs of either. Brood parasitism is an alternative way in which an A. sabulosa female can provide her larva with food and shelter. After completing her previous nest she must find a new digging site. While searching in the nesting area she may come across another female's nest, which she opens and usually brood parasitizes if it contains prey. It is again difficult to compare the time costs of non-parasitic nesting and parasitism, this time because alternative behaviours are not mutually exclusive - finding digging sites and finding other females' nests both involve searching on the nesting area. Females might find other females' nests opportunistically, or spend time searching for them. My methods and interpretation are compared with those of BROCKMANN et al., who analysed alternative nesting strategies in Sphex ichneumoneus. The alternative behaviours in Sphex are 'digging' and 'entering', two ways of acquiring a burrow. BROCKMANN et al. included nights and periods of poor weather in their time cost measurements, decreasing the likelihood of detecting differences between the net benefits of digging and entering. They also assumed that eggs laid after digging and entering had equal chances of survival, and that a female decides unconditionally to either dig or enter immediately after closing her previous nest. A major problem in both studies is that of pin-pointing when decisions are made and hence defining the strategy set. This is particularly difficult when alternative behaviours are not mutually exclusive.</page><page sequence="184">826 VOLUME 110 Behaviour Vol. 1 10 (1989) pp. 244-247 POPULATION-LEVEL ASYMMETRY OF HAND PREFERENCE IN LEMURS NOBUO MASATAKA Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University, Inuyama, Aichi 484, Japan Captive ring-tailed lemurs, Lemur catta, were assessed for hand preference in order to determine what ihe proportion of preference for the left and right might be for the population.

MULLER Lehrstuhl fur Evolutionsforschung der Universitat, Postfach 8640, D-4800 Bielefeld 1, B.R.D. Males of the burying beetle Necrophorus vespilloides were observed during pheromone emission in the field. The males emitted pheromones either after burial of a carcass ('haves') or without having found a carcass ('have-nots). Males of these two groups were equally effective in attracting conspecific females. Obviously females can distinguish 'have-nots' from 'haves' as soon as they meet the male for the first time. Most of the females attracted by 'have-not' males accepted copulations, whereas females attracted by 'have' males strongly rejected mating attempts of the pheromone-emitting male. A 'have' male was allowed to mate only after the female had found the carcass. Females that had been attracted by 'have- not' males usually flew off after a few minutes, whereas the duration of stay of females with 'have' males mostly exceeded 40 minutes. After having met an attracted female, 'haves' usually did not resume pheromone emission during this evening. 'Have-not' males hardly ever failed to resume scent emission after having been interrupted by a female. The benefit of the shown behaviour of 'have' and 'have-not' males as well as of females is discussed.

Box 24481, Karen, Nairobi, Kenya Among both kin and nonkin, opponents were significantly more likely to threaten their opponents' rela- tives following a fight than during matched-control periods (simple redirected aggression). Similarly, the relatives of two opponents were more likely to threaten each other following a fight than during matched- control periods (complex redirected aggression). Finally, the relatives of two opponents were more likely to interact affinitively following a fight than in the period preceding it (complex reconciliation). Reconciliation among related and unrelated opponents differed in the following respects. When kin fought, a much higher proportion of fights was followed by affinitive behavior, either between the opponents themselves (direct reconciliation) or between one opponent and the kin of another (simple reconciliation). Relatively high frequencies of reconciliation among kin, however, were apparently just a consequence of frequent overall affinitive interactions: when behavior during post-conflict periods was compared with behavior during matched-control periods, direct and simple reconciliation was more common among nonkin than among kin. Nonkin also differed from kin in whom they reconciled with. Kin were equally likely to reconcile with their opponents and their opponents' kin. In contrast, nonkin reconciled more often with their opponents' kin than with their opponents themselves.</page><page sequence="185">VOLUME 110 827 Behaviour Vol. 110 (1989) pp. 276-293 RESPONSES OF CHICKS TO BRIGHTLY COLOURED INSECT PREY T.J. ROPER and S.E. COOK School of Biology, University of Sussex, Brighton, BN1 9QG, U.K. In experiments 1 to 3, domestic chicks that had not previously been fed were given a choice between olive-green painted mealworms and mealworms that were painted with single colours (black, yellow or red), stripes of alternating colours (black-and-yellow, black-and-red or yellow-and-red) or half one colour and half another (black-and-yellow, black-and-red or yellow-and-red). Relative to olive-green mealworms, chicks showed a strong aversion to black prey, a milder aversion to black-and-yellow striped prey, and a marginal aversion to red prey. All other colours and patterns were either neutral or preferred. We conclude that neither striped prey nor unstriped bicoloured prey are necessarily more aversive than prey of a single colour, and that the results are best explained in terms of specific aversions to certain colours and patterns, rather than to some general feature of the prey such as novelty or contrast. Experiment 1 also showed that rearing chicks in black-and-yellow cages reduced or reversed their aversion to black-and-yellow striped and black prey, and increased their preference for yellow and bicoloured prey. We conclude that while preferences and aversions towards prey of these colours are unlearned their development can be affected by experience. Experiment 4 showed, using a one-trial learning procedure, that prey colour (black-and-yellow striped, black, yellow or bicoloured) did not significantly affect the strength of avoidance learning when the prey was distasteful. We conclude that unlearned preferences and aversions for particular prey do not interact with the effectiveness of avoidance learning.

GUETH Laboratoire de Psychophysiologie, CNRS (URA 1295) et Universite Louis Pasteur, 7 rue de l'Universite, F-67000 Strasbourg, France Possession of objects was studied in a captive group of kin-related brown capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella). Following introduction of an object by the experimenter, social interactions around the object were recorded during 15 min, focussing on takeovers, taking at distance and forced relinquishments. Results showed that individuals behaved according to tactical factors such as value and portability of objects. However, possession by subordinates could remain unchallenged by higher-ranking individuals and the latter tolerated some takeovers by subordinates. To account for such patterns, it is assumed that the dominants' behaviour is sometimes limited by the risk of altering the current state of their social relationships. Behaviour Vol. 110 (1989) pp.306-318 FORAGING PATCH DYNAMICS IN THE TEAL (ANAS CRECCA): EFFECTS OF SOCIALITY AND SEARCH METHOD SWITCHING HANNU POYSA Finnish Game and Fisheries Research Institute, Game Division, Evo Game Research Station, SF-16970 Evo, Finland The effects of social foraging and feeding method switching on foraging patch arrival-departure dynam- ics in the teal (Anas crecca) were studied. Overall patch arrival-departure dynamics was studied in three morning periods between 0300 h and 0900 h - early, mid and late morning. The arrival rate of fly- ing individuals did not differ between morning periods but the departure rate increased from early to mid morning. The arrival rate of flying individuals exceeded the departure rate in all morning periods. In the course of a morning, teals switched their foraging methods so that feeding depth at the patch gradually increased. This indicated a decrease in patch quality and feeding rate. An important favourable conse- quence of search method switching was, however, that teals could lengthen their patch residence time. As patch quality further deteriorated (i.e. feeding depth increased more and more), teals responded numeri- cally, and so that forager group size in the patch decreased. The increase in feeding- depth may provide a</page><page sequence="186">828 VOLUME 110 cue when to leave a patch. Forager group size in turn affected the magnitude of the deterioration in patch quality; the greater the group size, the more rapid the deterioration.</page><page sequence="187">VOLUME 111 829 Behaviour Vol. 111 (1989) pp. 1-12 ALERT CALLS OF MALE RED-WINGED BLACKBIRDS: DO FEMALES LISTEN? LES D. BELETSKY Department of Zoology, NJ-15, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, U.S.A. Male red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) have an unusual vocal alert system that operates throughout the breeding season. Territory owners give alert calls respectively during most of their activi- ties and transmit information about potential predators when they switch call types. Males are known to listen to each other's alert calls, presumably benefiting by receiving anti-predator information. Results of three separate tests supported the hypothesis that nesting female redwings also listen to and benefit from male alert calls. 1) Average call rates of males monitored through the breeding season increased signifi- cantly when their first mates started to incubate. Alerting information about predators may be especially important to females during this period because their ability to detect approaching predators is reduced while they are incubating in dense vegetation. 2) Nesting females gave different responses to playback of repetitive calls without call type changes ("background" calls) and with call type changes (which mimic a male changing call types after detecting a predator). Females were more vocal during broadcast of the tape containing call type changes, and, in some cases, they were also more likely to remain near their nests. 3) Females were more vigilant when their calling mates were absent from their territories, and less vigilant when their mates were present, suggesting that territory owners act as vocal sentinels. Behaviour Vol. 111 (1989) pp. 13-33 PERCEPTION OF THE FREQUENCY CHARACTERISTICS OF DISTRESS CALLS BY MALLARD DUCKLINGS (ANAS PLATYRHYNCHOS) STEPHEN J. GAIONI and CHRISTOPHER S. EVANS Psychology Department, Washington University, St. Louis, MO 63130, U.S.A. Three playback experiments demonstrated that mallard ducklings are perceptually tuned to the dominant frequency and rate of frequency sweep found in conspecific distress calls. We separated ducklings from their brood to induce them to distress call, and then measured the effectiveness of various synthesized distress calls in inhibiting the ducklings' own calls. 1. The dominant frequency and the rate of the terminal downward frequency sweep were estimated in 280 domesticated mallard duckling distress notes. 2. In Experiment 1, ducklings were tested with synthesized distress calls having notes with dominant frequencies which differed from the population mean by 0-6 standard deviations. The ducklings' responses to the synthesized calls were tightly linked to the natural distribution of this parameter. That is, calls which differed by 2-4 standard deviations from the population mean elicited significantly weaker responses than did the call with the mean dominant frequency. Domesticated mallard ducklings may be less sensitive to their own call frequency than to the slightly higher frequency of wild mallard distress calls. 3. In Experiments 2a and 2b, ducklings were tested with synthesized calls having rates of terminal frequency sweep which differed from the species-typical value by 0-4 standard deviations, or with constant frequency control calls Which matched the amplitude envelopes of the frequency modulated calls. Calls having rates of frequency sweep which significantly deviated from the norm elicited a weaker response. The results also suggested that mallard ducklings are sensitive to the amplitude envelopes of distress notes. 4. These experiment extend our previous research indicating that mallard ducklings' responses are linked to the natural distributions of the acoustic parameters of their vocal signals.

Previous work on Drosphila conformis revealed that males were aggregated at trees of Pisonia umbellifera, where they defended individual leaves at mating territories. Leaves of this tree species are distributed in distinct clusters at the ends of branches, and males tended to occupy and females visit the lowest leaves within a given cluster. Larger males were found to dominate smaller ones with the result that larger</page><page sequence="188">830 VOLUME Ill individuals generally occupied the lowest territories within a cluster. Here, data collected over a 2-year period are used to investigate settlement patterns of D. conformis on two larger spatial scales: between clusters in the same lek and between different leks. Within a single lek, both sexes (but particularly females) appeared to settle preferentially in the larger clusters, and as a result female encounters rates were usually greatest for males that occupied low leaves in larger clusters. Moreover, because of this female preference, relatively small (and presumably subordinate) males that held high leaves in large clusters encountered females more frequently than larger males that defended low leaves in small clusters. Among the three leks observed, ratios of male/territory varied only slightly, whereas female arrival rates/territory differed substantially and were greatest for the largest lek. Consequently, the average female encounter rates for males in the largest lek were 1.4-2.4 times greater than those recorded for males in the smaller aggregations.

WHITNEY Department of Biology, College of Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina, U.S.A. 29424 and Rockefeller University Field Research Center, Millbrook, New York, U.S.A. 12545 In a comparison of samples of wood thrush song recorded from southern New York State and coastal South Carolina, the following results demonstrate the striking similarity of song in these widely separated areas: (1) Of 25 discrete song types defined for the New York sample, 19 were found in South Carolina, (2) the relative abundances of the different song types were significantly correlated in two samples, and (3) according to a detailed quantitative analysis, the structure of the most common song type was the same in the two samples. Subtle differences did occur between the two samples. Although some of these differences may have been due merely to random sampling error, one difference-the absence of six types from the South Carolina sample-could not be dismissed in this way. This result indicates that some song types are not widely distributed. Another difference between the two samples had to do specifically with one of the song types absent from South Carolina. In the South Carolina sample were six unclassified songs that, although structurally diverse, all had certain features in common with the missing type and therefore may be related to it by cultural evolution. Behaviour Vol. 111 (1989) pp.61-76 EFFECTS OF MOTHER'S REARING CONDITION AND MULTIPLE MOTHERHOOD ON THE EARLY DEVELOPMENT OF MOTHER-INFANT INTERACTIONS IN JAVA-MACAQUES (MACACA FASCICULARIS) ANNEMIE KEMPS, PAUL TIMMERMANS and JO VOSSEN Department of Comparative and Physiological Psychology, University of Nijmegen, The Netherlands In this study we investigated the effects of a mother's social rearing condition and her parity on maternal behaviour, infant behaviour and behavioural development during the infant's first ten days. With respect to parity two classes were involved: primiparae (PR), and pluriparae (PL) with at least a 5th infant. For the primiparae two rearing conditions were involved: having grown up within the family group (FPR) which included mother, other mothers, juveniles and babies, and having grown up in a peer group (PPR) with no other companions than animals of the same age. All pluriparae were group-reared. It appeared that maternal and infant behaviour and behavioural development were not influenced by the mother's own rearing condition, by they were affected by earlier Experience with motherhood. All PPR mothers were adequate mothers and, in the first ten postpartum days, PPR and FPR mothers displayed nearly the same degree of restrictive infant-directed behaviour, which may be due to the novelty of having a baby. It is probably due to restriction that PR infants became not as active and explorative as PL infants in their first ten days. PL mothers were more permissive and rarely rejective. We found no support for the being-properly-mothered hypothesis, the observing-how-to-mother, and the learning-to-mother (by play) hypotheses, or the maternal rejection hypothesis. Mothers become less infant- directed and less restrictive and give the infant a wide action radius by habituating to and practising with</page><page sequence="189">VOLUME 111 831 their own infant. Within the limits of the cage and with only the mother present, it is primarily the infant that takes the initiative to make excursions. Behaviour Vol. 111 (1989) pp. 77-97 FEMALE MATING BEHAVIOUR AND MULTIPLE MATINGS IN THE FLY, DRYOMYZA ANILIS MERJA OTRONEN University of Oxford, Department of Zoology, South Parks Road, Oxford OXI 3PS, U.K. Multiple matings by females of the fly, Dryomyza anilis, were studied at small carcasses where they arrived to lay their eggs. Males of the species are territorial and fight over females and their oviposition sites. Arriving females were quickly captured by males and male flights over females as well as take- overs were common. The average number of matings per female was 2.8 and the average time a female spent at the carcass was 1 h 49 min (from arrival to the end of oviposition). The total mating time was almost twice as long in females which mated over five times than in females which had only one mating. The increase in mating time with increasing number of mating was totally due to the increase in time spent in copulation bouts (the species copulates and oviposits in several bouts). In attacks by lone males resulting in the separation of a pair, the attacker continued with the female in only one half of the cases (take-overs). In the other half a third male captured the female after she had escaped from the struggling males. In successful take-overs the new mate was usually larger than the earlier mate whereas in the other cases the new mate was almost always smaller than the earlier mate. Female resistance during matings was common and the various conflict behaviours are described. Female resistance became stronger in consecutive matings and within the same mating females resisted earlier in the second copulation bout than in the first one. In addition, larger females resisted more per mating, spent less time in copulation bouts per mating and had fewer matings than small females. Some possible costs and benefits of multiple matings were studied. Owing to male mating behaviour, where females are taken away from the carcass, females may loose feeding opportunities which can reduce their egg production. Male mating behaviour also delays female oviposition which can put the larvae in a worse position in food competition with other earlier larvae. Females arriving at carcasses to lay eggs face a situation where they can benefit from male guarding during oviposition but male fighting and take-overs can result in a long chain of matings which is disadvantageous for them.

The functions of these calls was determined by experimental playback. The grating call was highly stereotyped individually, and was used in sexual contexts (short version) or agonistic situations (long version). In contrast, the chattering call, displayed only by males, was used for self-advertisement and species recognition. The geographic variation of calls exhibited between two different populations is discussed.

Two pre-experimental treatments were used. One group of pigeons was maintained</page><page sequence="190">832 VOLUME Ill according to standard procedures for Cornell pigeons, the other group in a manner typical of Pisa pigeons, the main difference between the two groups was that the former were trained up to 25 km from the loft, whereas the latter were untrained but were free to fly around the loft area 2 to 6 days per week. Two series of four experimental releases were conducted at 31-34 and 57-67 km by releasing unmanipulated controls (both trained and untrained pigeons not rendered anosmic) and experimentals (both trained and untrained pigeons rendered temporarily anosmic during transport and also at the release site). When the pooled data on initial orientation are considered, the control groups show a small but significant homeward directedness, whereas the orientation of the anosmic birds is not different from random. The homing performance of anosmic birds was also significantly reduced. Thus, the results show that Cornell pigeons use olfactory cues for navigation. A residual homeward tendency found in the initial orientation of anosmic birds, though not significant, suggests the existence of an auxiliary non-olfactory mechanism whose nature is unknown, and which calls for further investigations. Both controls and experimental pigeons that had pre-test training were better orientated and homed better than their untrained counterparts. The trained groups also exhibited directional tendencies that were different from those of the untrained pigeons.

Zenaida doves (Zenaida aurita) nested on several small islands near Culebra, Puerto Rico, under rocks, herbs and low shrubs. When humans approached their nest sites, doves either walked surreptitiously, flew, or burst explosively from the nest when the intruder was very near. 2. Incubating parents usually walked from the nest, parents with hatching eggs usually walked, but sometimes flew from the nest, and parents with chicks usually flew from the nest. 3. Only parents with hatching eggs or chicks gave distraction displays. 4. Variations in flushing distance depended on stage in the reproductive cycle and study island, whereas distance initially flown from the nest also depended on distance to colony edge, and time to remain near the nest also depended on nesting stage and island. 5. Level of nest defense and parental risk increased at hatching, but did not continue to increase with age of the chick. Our data support SKUTCH (1949) and ANDERSSON et al.'s (1980) vulnerability hypothesis for parental care rather than TRIVER'S (1972) comulative investment hypothesis.</page><page sequence="191">VOLUME 111 Behaviour Vol. 111 (1989) pp. 144-160 ETUDE EXPERIMENTALE DES MODALITES DE COMMUNICATION DANS LE COMPORTEMENT SEXUAL DE CALLIPHORA VOMITORIA (DIPTERES, CAL,IPHORIDAE).

Experimental sets were constituted by wingless females, females with a gap between the wings, superposed wings (positions which, respectively, mean acceptance or rejection of the male), antero-posterior reversal of the wings and normal females (control set). Courtship was quantitatively evaluated in relation to the latency of male first contact with female, courtship duration and the main acts effected, number of copulations, motor units frequencies with their sequential and probabilistic analyses. The results show that male courtship behavior structure varies according to female body characteristics. Under similar olfactory conditions, courtship seems to begin with a short range visual stimuli. Afterwards, with contact, the sensorial information network remains and develops with complementary integration of tactile, vibratory and contact chemoreception stimuli. If one of those elements is suppressed or changed, courtship is modified. The courtship intented to gap-winged females is the most similar to normal courtship behaviour. Those experiments lay the emphasis on a progressive substitution of "perverted" courtship to normal courtship. From a repertory of potential acts, N courtships are feasible and the courtship is continuously reorganized. Copulation only disappears when the wings are inverted. Regardless of quantitative and qualitative information gathered, the male needs to identify with certainty that he is dealing with a female. This work suggest the necessary adequation between an internal image of the female and the actual model encountered by the male. Behaviour Vol. 111 (1989) pp. 161-195 AVIAN NEST DEFENCE: THEORETICAL MODELS AND EVIDENCE TOMAS REDONDO Catedra de Biologia y Etologia, Facultad de Veterinaria, UNEX, 10071 Caceres, Spain Functional explanations for variations in levels of avian nest defence have been often based upon as- sumptions concerning optimal allocation of reproductive effort. Such a theoretical framework has led to the formulation of mathematical models aimed at predicting patterns of nest defence in the field. Here, a model is proposed that, starting from a general theoretical standpoint about optimal parental care, in- tegrates previous models and generates new predictions concerning variables not previously included, namely predatory risk for both parents and offspring and age-dependent defensive tactics of nestlings. Optimal levels of parental defence are then expected to increase with (1) parent-offspring relatedness, (2) brood size, (3) offspring quality, (4) potential risk for the offspring, (5) offspring age, and (6) enhance- ment of offspring's self-defensive tactics while (7) parental residual reproductive value and (8) potential risk for parents are excepted to exert a negative effect upon optimal levels of defence. Empirical data are reviewed for testing the model's predictions. Available data provide strong support for predictions con- cerning parameters 4, 5, 6, and 8. Failed tests concerning parameters 2 and 3 are shown to be flawed in the sense that we should except defence levels of reflect intra-, instead of inter-individual variations in size and quality of the brood. A more detailed analysis is made concerning variations in residual repro- ductive value-correlated traits, such as brood number or time in the breeding season. It is argued that, when dealing with such traits, severe violations of basic assumptions (i.e. coeteris paribus statements or absence of an actual correlation between such traits and residual reproductive value) can occur, lead- ing to unexpected results. It is concluded that life-history theory can account for most of the variability observed in nest defence patterns. 833</page><page sequence="192">834 VOLUME 111 Behaviour Vol. 111 (1989) pp. 196-207 ALLOGROOMING AND INTERINDIVIDUAL PROXIMITY IN TWO SPECIES OF MACAQUES (MACACA FASCICULARIS AND M. NEMESTRINA) ALFONSO TROISI Cattedra di Clinica Psichiatrica, II Universita di Roma, Rome, Italy GABRIELLE SCHINO and FILIPPO AURELI Cattedra di Ecologia ed Etologia Animale, Dipartimento di Genetica e Biologia Molecolare, Universita La Sapienza, Rome, Italy This study analysed relationships between allogrooming and spatial proximity in two captive groups of congeneric species of monkeys, the Java monkey and the pigtail macaque. Its methodological features were as follows: 1) proximity during grooming was not recorded; 2) dyadic scores, not individual totals, were entered into statistical analysis; and 3) baseline proximity was computed in order to assess the effects of proximity on grooming and of grooming on proximity. Significant positive correlations between allogrooming and overall proximity were found in both monkey groups. In the Java monkeys, proximity rates recorded 1 minute before and after grooming were sig- nificantly higher than baseline proximity. In the pigtails, significant differences with respect to baseline proximity were found for the 2nd and 1st minute before grooming and for the first four minutes after grooming. However, the finding of a significant positive correlation between allogrooming and baseline proximity (i.e. proximity temporally-independent of grooming) indicated that the two behaviours were not correlated merely as a result of the short-term causal relations between them. The results of this study suggest the existence of two types of allogrooming: one is elicited by proximity and influences the subsequent spatial relationships between the partners; the other is not related to proximity by a time-order sequence but expresses the same mutual preference.

EFFECTS OF DOMINANCE HIERARCHY ON THE DIVISION OF LABOUR MICHEL PRATTE C.N.R.S.-Ethologie, 31 Ch. Joseph-Aiguier, 13402 Marseille Cedex 09, France In this study, we investigated how various roles are distributed among associated females of Polistes dominulus Christ. The times spent on forty five different activities were observed in thirty one foundress associations. The females were classified into oa, ,B and -y classes on the basis of the postures adopted in two-wasp encounters. Canonical discriminant analyses separated the three classes satisfactory and ranked the class means in the correct dominance order. Alpha females spent significantly more time on behaviours related to reproduction and attendance at the nest, and significantly less time on foraging activities and various extra nest activities. In Beta females, the time spent on cell elongation was larger than in the other classes. Abdominal wagging was shorter in Gamma females than in the others. The total resting time was longer in az females, and the total grooming time was the same in all three classes. On the other hand, the ratios of resting time at the nest to the total resting time and the ratio of grooming at the nest to the total grooming time varied as a function of the females' dominance rank. It is suggested that individuals' aptitude for leaving the nest is a function of their hierarchical rank and that this aptitude partly determines which kinds of tasks are performed.

Song types usually were learned from conspecific tutors: Males learned from male, females from female tutors.</page><page sequence="193">VOLUME 111 835 In exceptional situations song types may be learnt from the other sex, proving an ability to produce song of both sexes. Birds reared without tutors nevertheless produced some species-typical song in generlized form, suggesting an innate predisposition for these vocalizations. Once established during the first 6-8 months of life, individual repertoires remained unchanged for years. Pair mates regularly dueted. Neither random pairings nor mate exchanges revealed repertoire alteration in mates. Neither misdeveloped nor reduced song repertoires hampered successful breeding in captivity. Behaviour Vol. 11 1 (1989) pp. 234-256 POLYGYNY IN THE EUROPEAN STARLING RIANNE PINXTEN, MARCEL EENS and RUDOLF F. VERHEYEN Department of Biology, University of Antwerp, U.I.A., Universiteitsplein 1, B-2610 Wilrijk, Belgium 1. The polygynous behaviour of male starlings breeding in nest box colonies around Antwerp, Belgium, was studied for 4 years in order to investigate whether polygyny is a widespread reproductive strategy in this species. 2. The proportion of breeding males occupying more than one nest box ranged from 44% to 72%. Some males (23%) apparently 'preferred' to mate monogamously since they occupied only one nest box despite one or more unoccupied neighbouring nest boxes being available. Generally, the occupation of more than one nest box was not related to arrival date, age or morphological characteristics. 3. On average 39% of breeding males tried to become polygynous. Of these males, 68% tried to attract a second female during the fertile period of their first one. By occupying nest boxes situated close together, male starlings can try to attract a second female at the same time that they guard their first female. Males varied considerably in the number of days they tried to become polygynous (range 2-11 days). However, most (85%) were trying during the laying period. The fact that all males trying to attract an additional female had permanently stopped their attempts at the latest when the nestlings were 10 days old suggests that after this point the possible benefits of trying to attract an additional female are outweighed by the costs incurred from not feeding their young at that time. 4. The frequency of polygyny in the starling was established for the first time and ranged from 20% to maximum 60%. These results indicate that the starling has to be considered as a regular polygynist (exceeding the limit of 5% of male breeding records). Bigamy was the form of polygyny typical in our study areas. Older males were polygynous more frequently than yearlings, possibly because they alto tried to attract a secondary female more frequently and hid higher success than yearling males. As regards arrival sequence, there was no significant difference in the proportion of early and late arriving males that were polygynous. Early males tried to become polygynous more frequently than late males, but did not have higher success. 5. Polygynous males produced significantly more fledgings per year than did monogamous males (7.9 vs 4.6), strongly suggesting that they achieved higher fitness compared to monogamous males. However, so far, accurate measures of the variance in male reproductive success are not possible, since the frequency of successful extra-pair copulations in the starling remains unknown. Behaviour Vol. 111 (1989) pp. 257-269 SONG IN SWEDISH GREAT TITS: INTRA- OR INTERSEXUAL COMMUNICATION? MATS BJORKLUND, BJORN WESTMAN and KLAS ALLANDER Dept. of Zoology, Uppsala University, Box 561, S-751 22 Uppsala, Sweden This study examines the relative importance of song as a means of intra- as compared to intersexual communication in a Swedish population of great tits. Song duels and matched countersinging events did not occur more often than predicted by chance, in fact, neighbouring males tended to sing asynchrously in time. Males did not switch song type in associated with change of song perch, contrary to the predictions of the "Beau Geste" hypothesis. Response to playback was generally low, and dependent of female presence. After pairing, males reduced their time spent singing by about 50%. When paired males temporarily lost contact with their mates, they greatly increased their singing rate. These observations show that song in Swedish great tits is primarily used as an intersexual signal, while in English populations, both functions are important. This difference is probably due to weaker competition for breeding space in the Swedish population in combination with a higher degree of movements during the non-breeding season.</page><page sequence="194">836 VOLUME 111 Behaviour Vol. 111 (1989) pp. 270-290 SONG AS A POSSIBLE REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATING MECHANISM BETWEEN TWO PARAPATRIC FORMS.

BREHMII IN THE WESTERN PYRENEES MARC SALOMON Laboratoire de Zoologie (Mammiferes-Oiseaux), Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle, 55 rue Buffon, 75005 Paris, France Playback of natural and electroacoustically-generated songs to 49 European (Phylloscopus c. collybita) and 48 Iberian (P. c. brehmii) chiffchaffs gave the following results. In collybita, males respond little to the song of brehmii whereas females show a strong response. In brehmii, males react strongly to collybita's song whereas females respond very little. The following data concern only the males. In general, brehmii are more aggressive then collybita. The two forms are not sensitive to the same song parameters. The temporal biological phases have no effect on the relative responses. Collybita are most sensitive to song broadcasts of the beginning of the breeding cycle; acoustic sensitivity then decreases and once the territories are established, it remains constant. In brehmii, territoriality and aggressiveness remain high throughout the season Collybita show the same level of reaction to song broadcasts both in allopatry and in sympatry; one the other hand, brehmii react less to the European song when the Iberian chiffchaffs prevail. When acoustic contact of both forms is continuous, collybita becomes more sensitive to a broadcast Iberian song. The relative responses do not depend on the initial excitement level. Behaviour Vol. 111 (1989) pp. 291-304 VISUAL ASSESSMENT OF AVIAN THREAT IN SEMI-CAPTIVE RINGTAILED LEMURS (LEMUR CATTA) JOSEPH M. MACEDONIA and JOSEPH F. POLAK Department of Biological Anthropology and Anatomy, and Department of Zoology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27706, U.S.A. Visual assessment of avian stimuli as threatening or non-threatening was investigated experimentally in semi-captive, forest-living ringtailed lemurs (Lemur catta). Subjects were presented silhouettes of different sizes and shapes on overhead runs. Antiraptor calls elicited by the silhouettes were recorded and quantified. Realistic and stylized hawk shapes elicited more total calling per trial than did a square shape. Large hawk shapes elicited longer individual calls than a large goose shape, and all bird shapes elicited longer calls than did a square but not a diamond shape. We suggest the observed response patterns reflect a differential in perceived avian threat and that they support an ecologically-oriented view of the "short neck" interpretation for raptor shape recognition.

DE KOGEL Department of Comparative Physiology, University of Utrecht, Padualaan 14, Postbox 80.086, 3508 TB Utrecht, and Burgers' Dierenpark, Arnhem, The Netherlands In a captive group of 29 chimpanzees, eight mothers with their infants were studied. Data are presented on the associations between (1) individual characteristics of the mother and measures of her social position in the group, (2) mother-infant behaviour and (3) infant sociability. Possible effects of the age of the infants were eliminated throughout the analysis by means of a partial correlation test. Results show that mothers with more offspring spent more time in social positive interactions with their older offspring and were more rejecting to their youngest infant. Mothers that received less aggression broke contact with their infants relatively more often. Infants of such mothers spent more time in social play with others and were less time in contact with their mother. Counter intuitively, we also found that more sociable mothers had infants that spent less time in social play. It is suggested that the correlation between sociability of mother and infant depends on the group size and/or the amount of social crowding.</page><page sequence="195">VOLUME 112 837 Behaviour Vol. 112 (1990) pp. 1-22 CO-OPERATIVE BREEDING IN RIFLEMEN (ACANTHISSITTA CHLORIS) BENEFITS TO PARENTS, OFFSPRING AND HELPERS GREGORY H. SHERLEY Edward Percival Field Station, University of Canterbury, Kaikoura, New Zealand Two types of helpers were observed feeding young of the New Zealand rifleman (Acanthisitta chloris): "regulars" and "casuals". The former contributed significantly to feeding young from only one nest while the latter contributed a trivial amount to young from a mate from the brood they helped. While some casuals were unpaired adult males, most were current season offspring helping with their parents' second clutch. The relative contributions of parents and helpers in raising broods were measured to establish the benefits of co-operative breeding to offspring and feeders. Whether or not helpers were present while feeding young, the breeding female's contribution was the same. By contrast, the work load of the breeding male was significantly reduced when helpers were present, but even then he usually contributed more than this mate. That male parents benefited most from helpers feeding young was probably related to their being responsible for most of the feeding in the absence of helpers. A helper's presence did not improve productivity or the male parent's chance of survival. However, female parents of nests with regular helpers survived better than those without. Offspring fed by helpers were not heavier upon fledging nor were their chances of survival improved. The interval between fledging first clutch broods and laying second clutches was the same whether helpers were present or not. Behaviour Vol. 112 (1990) pp. 23-35 DEATH IN THE DISTANCE: MORTALITY RISK AS INFORMATION FOR FORAGING ANTS PETER NONACS Behavioural Ecology Research Group, Department of Biological Sciences, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, B.C. V5A 1S6 Canada Ant forages are known to communicate food presence in distant patches, but do they also communicate information about distant mortality risk? Recruitment to a food source in a laboratory Lasius pallitarsis colony depended upon whether the initial returning forages had encountered mortality risk (a larger Formica subnuda) and the quality of the food they found. When food quality was high, risk appeared to not affect recruitment; when quality was low, risk inhibited foraging. In a second experiment, L. pallitarsis colonies had access to food of several qualities through a divided trail, which forced foragers to take different routes to and from the food patch. Danger was either entirely absent, present only on the way to the patch, present only on the way from the patch, or along both routes. When food quality was poor colonies recruited to food when risk was absent, but risk anywhere significantly reduced the level of foraging. This included the situation where only returning forages could encounter danger, which strongly suggests that their behaviour was a critical factor in whether nestmates would continue foraging. When food quality was moderate, only treatments with risk on the way to the food significantly inhibited foraging. When food quality was good, colonies continued to forage at a high rate, irrespective of presence or location or risk. In total, L. pallitarsis foragers appear to communicate and use information about both food and mortality risk in deciding whether to exploit patches.

BLAUSTEIN Department of Zoology, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon 97331-2914, U.S.A. We tested juvenile Townsend's chipmunks (Tamias townsendii) to determine whether 1) they could distin- guish kin from non-kin and 2) to assess of this ability was based on familiarity or no genetic relatedness. Seventy-three pups between the ages of 55-62 days were observed in 68 pairwise tests. The frequencies (number/trial) and durations (length in seconds) of 8 behaviors as well as the mean distance between pups were recorded in 10 min. trials. Analyses indicated that frequencies of behaviors varied depending on re- latedness (related/unrelated) and familiarity (familiar/unfamiliar) but durations of behaviors did not. Pups</page><page sequence="196">838 VOLUME 112 discriminated between familiar and unfamiliar animals in the frequency of contacts, and the occurrence of attacks and chases. Pups discriminated between animals on the basis of relatedness in the occurrence of chasing. Both relatedness and familiarity played a role in the frequency of sniffing and grooming and in the mean distance between pups, as shown by the significant interaction between familiarity and re- latedness in 2-way ANOVAs. The sex composition of pairs (male-male, male-female or female-female) influenced the mean distance between pups. We can only speculate on the functions of kin recognition in Townsend's chipmunk. It may enable animals to selectively direct nepotistic behavior toward kin or facilitate optimal outbreeding. Behaviour Vol. 112 (1990) pp. 53-83 INTERVENTIONS IN A HERD OF SEMI-CAPTIVE PLAINS ZEBRAS MATTHIJS B. H. SCHILDER Laboratory of Comparative Physiology, University of Utrecht, P.O. Box 80.086, 3508 TB Utrecht, The Netherlands In a herd of semi-captive plains zebras interventions, which occurred within the harems, were investigated in order to answer the question why zebras interfered. These interventions are of interest because they regulate the contacts between companions and because, as corrective and preventive measures, they reveal the normative principles underlying the behaviours by which animals structure their social environment. An attempt was made to deduce 1) the internal norms of the interferer; 2) his short term aims; 3) his tactis and 4) his perception of the social environment. The analysis revealed that in the case of an affiliative interaction foals, yearlings and adult mares started to interfere if a friend had an affiliative contact with another zebra. In view of the interferer's behaviours it was concluded that their aim was to break off the ongoing interaction and that zebras tended to protect friendship bonds. Foals and yearlings further interfered if their mother was being threatened, attacked or sexually approached by a stallion. In view of the interferer's behaviours its aim was to prevent iminent interactions or to break off ongoing interactions. This suggests that these interventions were of a protective nature. The interferer's behaviours in both contexts ware very much alike. Mares tended to interfere if their foal/yearling or adult daughter was threathened or aggressed or if a mare friend was being sexually approached by a stallion. This type of intervention was of a protective nature. Stallions in a multi male harem showed a high tendency to interfere in courtship interactions. From the resemblance between interventions in courtship and in aggressive interactions it is concluded that, at leat in a number of cases, the individuals have perceived courtship behaviour by the stallion as a threat towards the mare involved. Behaviour Vol. 112 (1990) pp. 84-98 EXPLORING PRIMATE SOCIAL COGNITION: SOME CRITICAL REMARKS HANS KUMMER, VERENA DASSER and PAUL HOYNINGEN-HUENE Ethology &amp; Wildlife Research, Institute of Zoology, University of Zurich-Irchel, Winterthurerstrasse 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; Department of Psychology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, U.S.A.; Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Department of Humanities, ETH Zentrum, 8092 Ztirich, Switzerland The paper expresses the author's views on the growing interest in primate social cognition, particularly among descriptive primate ethologists. Its characteristics are the hope to extract cognitive interpretations from filed anecdotes, the free use of intentional language, and the untested and so far untestable idea that primate intelligence was selected in social contexts. We believe that 1) To understand how the animal itself represents the structure of its group or its habitat is perhaps the most ethological ethology there is and well worth pursuing. The study of social cognition, in particular, has long been neglected. 2) However, it requires of ethologists that they learn from established cognitive science and integrate its categories with their own. This is an interdisciplinary enterprise. 3) A traditional inductive study begins with anecdotes, which then are translated into hypotheses, which in turn are subjected to empirical tests including experiments. Sociobiology began to publish hypotheses without tests; the social cognition move now goes on to publish anecdotes without hypotheses, with a strong penchant for anthropomorphic interpretations in terms of social manipulation. This is little more than applying human prejudice. Phylogenetic and cognitive insights will come from testing alternative levels of organization in an animal's social knowledge about the same behavioral interaction. The experiment is the largely unavoidable method. Examples are given.</page><page sequence="197">VOLUME 112 839 4) The speculation of the social origin of primate intelligence is tentatively interpreted in two possible directions. A version based on ROZIN'S (1976) view that generalized mammal intelligence evolved from context-specific "Adaptive Specializations" seems the more accessible to ethological thinking and method.

THE INFLUENCE OF THE REARING ENVIRONMENT ON THE ORGANIZATION OF DUSTBATHING KLAUS VESTERGAARD, JERRY A. HOGAN and JAAP P. KRUIJT Zoological Laboratory, University of Groningen, The Netherlands The purpose of this study was to determine the role played by functional experience in the development of the dustbathing behavior system in junglefowl. Small groups of birds were raised either in a rich environment with sand and earth, or in a poor environment with a wire mesh floor. Dustbathing and other behaviors were recorded at intervals between 2 and 9 months of age. The results showed that the form of the individual behavior patterns as well as the organization of extended bouts of dustbathing developed normally in chicks raised in a dustless environment. Further, the frequency of occurrence of dustbathing and the diurnal rhythm did not differ between groups raised in the two environments. Functional experience was necessary for the development of dust recognition, but some stimuli came to be recognized as "dust" more easily than others. Behaviour Vol. 112 (1990) pp. 117-148 QUANTITATIVE DESCRIPTION OF EARLY MOTHER-INFANT INTERACTION USING INFORMATION THEORETICAL STATISTICS T. VAN WULFFTEN PALTHE, B. HOPKINS and J.E. VOS Department of Developmental Neurology, University Hospital, 9713 EZ Groningen, The Netherlands The general hypothesis concerning the development of dyadic interaction ascribed to here is that during the first six weeks after birth the infant is insufficiently equipped for active participation in en face interaction and acts relatively independently of his mother. Due to the maturation of underlying neural mechanisms at the age of about two months, a number of crucial transformations occur in postural, motor and visual functions (see PRECHTL, 1984). These developmental changes enable the infant to become an increasingly active partner in en face interaction: a two-way process during which both mother and infant relate the timing of their behaviour to that of the other. Six healthy mother-infant pairs participated in this longitudinal, home-based study which made use of video equipment to record a 15 min interaction session at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 21 weeks of age. The infant behaviours selected for study were: posture, movement, looking, smile, whimper, grunt, "pleasure" vocalization, yawn, grasping hands in mid-line, hand-mouth contact. Maternal behaviours selected were: locking, body movement, head movement, touching, speech, other vocalizations and sound effects, moving infant's limbs. The aim of the study was to provide a quantitative description of the changes in the sequential dependence of behaviour with the mother-infant pairs. To this end information theoretical statistics as elaborated by van den BERCKEN (1979) and van den BERCKEN &amp; COOLS (1980) were applied making use of analysis of variance terminology. The methodological problem of taking into account the constraint stemming from each partner's own previous behaviour (auto-correlation) when making inferences about ongoing behaviour between the two partners (cross-correlation) was removed by identifying and successfully controlling the various sources of influences affecting behaviour during dyadic interaction. The data were addressed to the following questions: l. Was there a change in the use the infants made of their behavioural repertoire (individual variability of the infant) during the age-range studied? 2. Was there a change in the use the mothers made of their behavioural repertoire (individual variability of the mother)? 3. Was there a change in the constraint on the infant's current behaviour stemming from his previous behaviour, i.e. did the amount of variance explained by the exclusive influence of the infant's own preceding behaviour on its current behaviour (autocovariability) increase during the age-range studied?</page><page sequence="198">840 VOLUME 112 4. Was there a change in the constraint on the infant's current behaviour stemming from his mother's previous behaviour, i.e. did the amount of variance explained by the exclusive influence of the mother's previous behaviour (cross-covariability) increase during the age-range studied? 5. Was there a change in the constraint on the infant's current behaviour stemming only from the combined effect of his own and his mother's previous behaviour, i.e. did the so-called synergic covariability effect become stronger during the age-range studied which reflected increasing mutual dependence between the behaviour of the two partners? For both mothers and infants an increase was found in individual variability while no changes were found in the measures of auto- and cross-covariability. The measure of synergic covariability became increasingly stronger from 12 weeks onwards. These results were interpreted as follows: over the age-range studied infant and mother showed a growing mutual dependence (stronger synergic covariability) with increasing use of their own repertoire (increasing individual variabilities) while the infant's behaviour neither became less dependant on his own previous behaviour (auto-covariability) nor more dependant on the mother's previous behaviour (cross-covariability). Thus a quantitative confirmation of the general hypothesis stated at the onset was provided. Moreover, information theoretical statistics have proved a satisfactory method by means of which dyadic interaction between mother and infant can be described quantitatively. Behaviour Vol. 112 (1990) pp. 149-161 INSTABILITY OF HAREMS OF FERAL HORSES IN RELATION TO SEASON AND PRESENCE OF SUBORDINATE STALLIONS ELIZABETH FRANKE STEVENS Department of Biology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, N.C. 27514, U.S.A. Male horses (Equus caballus) defend harems of females (bands) year-round and throughout their lifetimes. A male's lifetime reproductive success depends upon the number of females in his harem. Although harems have previously been reported as remaining stable over many years, during the two years of this study 30% of the adult females in an island population of feral horses changed harems during late winter. The seasonal differences in harem stability resulted from seasonal differences in the abundance and distribution of food. The spacing between band members was greater and the frequency of social interactions between then was lower in winter than in summer. In addition, the amount of time devoted to grazing increased in winter. These differences are attributed to the lower availability of suitable vegetation during winter. Harem stability did not depend on the age of females, the size of the harem, nor the age of the harem stallion, but did depend on the presence of subordinate stallions attached to the band. All of the females that changed bands left single-male bands; multi-male bands were stable throughout the study. Behaviour Vol. 112 (1990) pp. 162-175 TERRITORIALITY IN A TERRESTRIAL SALAMANDER: THE INFLUENCE OF RESOURCE QUALITY AND BODY SIZE ALICIA MATHIS Department of Biology, University of Southwestern Louisiana, Lafayette, Louisiana 70504, U.S.A. Intraspecific interference competition associated with territoriality has been documented in laboratory studies of the red-backed salamander, Plethodon cinereus. I used laboratory and field experiments to study the effect of resource quality and body size on such competition. In an experiment in southwestern Virginia, cover objects (e.g., logs) from which the resident salamanders were removed were invaded significantly more often than cover objects from which the resident salamander was not removed. These data provide the first direct test of territoriality for a salamander in a natural habitat. Newly invading salamanders were significantly smaller than the original territorial residents. Therefore, large body size is an advantage in territorial encounters. Because cover objects are important resources for terrestrial salamanders, characteristics of the cover object may contribute to territory quality. In an experiment conducted during warm summer weather at the Virginia site, soil temperatures under large cover objects were significantly cooler than those under small cover objects or under the leaf litter. Large cover objects may therefore benefit the salamanders by providing a buffer zone between the salamander and extreme environmental temperatures on the forest floor. In both laboratory and field experiments, when salamanders were offered a choice between large and small cover objects, both large and small salamanders exhibited a significant preference for large cover objects. Also I censused cover objects in a natural mixed hardwood forest habitat during courting</page><page sequence="199">VOLUME 112 841 and noncourting seasons and, for both seasons, I found a significant positive correlation between the body size of the salamander and the size of the cover object that it occupied. I conclude that, in this natural forest habitat, there is intraspecific competition for high quality cover objects and larger individuals are more successful competitors than smaller individuals. Behaviour Vol. 112 (1990) pp. 176-193 ROUTINE FORMATION AND FLEXIBILITY IN SOCIAL AND NON-SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR OF AGGRESSIVE AND NON-AGGRESSIVE MALE MICE R.F. BENUS, S. DEN DAAS, J.M. KOOLHAAS and G.A. VAN OORTMERSSEN Dept. of Animal Physiology, University of Groningen, P.O. Box 14, 9750 AA Haren, The Netherlands To investigate the relationship between aggression and routine-like behaviour the response of male mice of bidirectionally selected lines for attack latency to a change in the social and non-social environment has been measured. In a non-social situation the extent of routine-like behaviour was measured in a Y-maze in which only one of the two arms gave access to the food compartments. The number of errors made in response to reversal of the arm that was blocked was taken as indicator for the degree of routine formation. Males of the short attack latency (SAL) line made significantly more errors, and hence were more routine-like in their performance, than mice of the long attack latency (LAL) line. Males of the LAL line that nevertheless had short attack latencies (i.e. aggressive LAL mice) turned out to be flexible in their behaviour; their response was similar to that of the non-aggressive LAL males. In a social situation SAL and aggressive LAL mice were used to investigate routine formation in attacking behaviour. The males were given different amounts of experience with male opponents after which their own female was introduced as opponent. The more extended the experience with male intruders was, the more SAL males subsequently attacked their female. In contrast, LAL mice appropriately changed their behaviour towards the female opponent. Thus, the attacking behaviour of SAL mice gets routine-like, whereas that of LAL males remains flexible. It is concluded that selection for attack latency generally coincides with selection for routine-like behaviour, suggesting that these two factors are influenced by many of the same genes. Regarding the fact that aggressive males of the LAL line show flexible behaviour, it may be proposed that with the phenotypic selection for attack latency there has in fact been selected for a mechanism that determines the organization (routine-like vs flexible) of behaviour. Behaviour Vol. 112 (1990) pp. 194-201 RISK SENSITIVE COURTSHIP IN THE GUPPY (POECILIA RETICULATA) ANNE E. MAGURRAN and BENONI H. SEGHERS School of Biological Sciences, University of Wales, Bangor, Gwynedd, LL57 2UW, U.K. This study investigated population differences in the courtship behaviour of male guppies, Poecilia retic- ulata, in the presence and absence of predators. Two Trinidad populations were compared: the Lower Aripo where guppies occur sympatrically with a range of piscivores and the Upper Aripo where levels of fish predation are low. Upper Aripo males displayed risk-reckless courtship behaviour and did not re- duce their sigmoid display rate or otherwise modify their courtship behaviour when threatened by two Astyanax bimaculatus. The courtship behaviour of the Lower Aripo males was, by contrast, risk sensitive. These fish performed a lower proportion of sigmoid displays and increased their level of sneaky mating attempts in the presence of predators. Although males from the two populations used both sneaky and conventional courtship behaviours there were individual differences in the use of the reproductive tactics. Behaviour Vol. 112 (1990) pp. 202-221 VARIATION IN THE MATING SYSTEM AND ASSOCIATED PARENTAL BEHAVIOUR OF CAPTIVE AND FREE-LIVING CICHLASOMA NIGROFASCIATUM (PISCES, CICHLIDAE) MILES H.A.

In experimental ponds in southern Canada and streams in north-western Costa Rica two variations on this</page><page sequence="200">842 VOLUME 112 system were studied: male desertion followed by maternal care, and simultaneous bigamy by males. In the ponds, with a female-biased sex ratio, males deserted or became bigamous when their broods were at all stages from eggs to advanced, free-swimming fry. These departures from monogamy did not consistently influence brood survival, except that broods deserted by their father shortly after spawning did not survive, whereas those deserted when they were at least one week into the fry stage survived to independence with only their mother as guardian. Both in the ponds and at the field sites females with monogamous partners spent more time away from their broods than did deserted females, but only in the ponds did this correspond with reduced feeding by the deserted females. In nature all parental females foraged less often than did non-parental females, and this reduction was not strongly influenced by mate desertion. Brood defense behaviour by adults in monogamous pairs provided some evidence of division of parental labour. In the ponds guarding females attacked sub-adult juveniles more than males did, whereas in the field guarding females attacked non-cichlid fishes (mainly characins and poeciliids) and conspecific females and juveniles more than males did. Both in the ponds and the field guarding males attacked conspecific adult males more than females did. Most deserted, brood-guarding females seen in Costa Rican streams had young that were relatively large, mobile fry, approaching independence. This may reflect the need for both parents to guard their young during the first few days of free-swimming. They are probably highly vulnerable to predators at this stage and paternal desertion may be more costly than later, when they are stronger swimmers and better able to escape from predators. Behaviour Vol. 112 (1990) pp. 222-245 DEVELOPMENT OF ANTISNAKE DEFENSES IN CALIFORNIA GROUND SQUIRRELS (SPERMOPHILUS BEECHEYI): I. BEHAVIORAL AND IMMUNOLOGICAL RELATIONSHIPS NAOMIE S. PORAN and RICHARD G. COSS Department of Psychology, University of California, Davis, California 95616 U.S.A. The development of antisnake behavioral and immunological defenses was investigated in laboratory born California ground squirrels (Spermophilus beecheyi) from an area in California where Northern Pacific rattlesnakes (Crotalus viridis oreganus) and Pacific gopher snakes (Pituophis melanoleucus catenifer) are abundant. Previous studies have shown that adult ground squirrels from this area possess innate physiological resistance to rattlesnake venom while pups are highly vulnerable to predation from snakes. Pups from other areas are known to exhibit snake recognition and adult-like antisnake behaviors on first encounter, a finding that prompted further study of pups from this area. The present study had four objectives: 1) to determine if inexperienced pups' can distinguish rattlesnakes from gopher snakes, 2) to determine what role mothers play in shaping their pups' behavior during their first encounters with snakes, 3) to determine if maturational factors affect the expression of antisnake behaviors, and 4) to determine if maturational factors affect rattlesnake venom resistance, especially during the first weeks of life. Two groups of 63-70 day-old pups were studied during their first encounters with both a rattlesnake and a gopher snake. The snakes were presented separately in a wire-screened compartment positioned in the center of the experiment room containing sand substratum. Pups in this setting were either alone or with their mothers during 5-min encounters with the snakes, which were video taped from an overhead mirror. Two years later, pups which had previously engaged the snakes with their mothers were retested with the same snakes as adults and their behavior was compared to that of the earlier group of pups encountering the snakes alone. In another group of pups, radioimmunoassays of serum-to-venom binding examined changes in venom resistance at 14, 30, 48 and 80 days of age. The results indicated that pups do indeed differentiate rattlesnakes from gopher snakes irrespective of whether the mother is present or absent as inferred from the greater time that they spent near the rattlesnake. When the mothers were present, pups spent much less time investigating the rattlesnake or gopher snake closely as compared with the condition in which pups were alone. Except for displacing pups interacting with the snakes at close range, which could theoretically reduce the probability of pup injury, mothers exhibited very little overt protection of pups. Pups and adults behaved similarly when they engaged the snakes as evinced by their close-range investigative behavior, substrate throwing, and tail-flagging activity with the exception that adults were less vigilant in monitoring the snake's activity from anywhere in the experiment room. Analysis of developmental changes in venom resistance revealed that serum-to-venom binding achieves adult levels at 30 days of age which is about 15 days prior to burrow emergence. Despite adult serum-to-venom binding levels, pups are vulnerable to envenomation due to their reduced body mass and serum volume available to neutralize rattlesnake venom.</page><page sequence="201">VOLUME 112 843 From an over-all perspective, recently emerged ground squirrel pups from a population in which adults are highly resistant to rattlesnake venom are vulnerable to snake predation. Yet, enigmatically, they exhibit adult-like patterns of antisnake behaviors that are very risky, such as close-range investigation and substrate throwing. Tail flagging at the pup stage of development is more easily interpretable as providing some protection from snakes because it attracts the mother's attention and that of nearby adults who are likely to intervene. We interpret the early appearance in pups of risky adult-like investigate and snake-harassment behaviors as a by-product of epigenetic processes aimed at older, less vulnerable stages of development in which these behaviors are likely to have greater defensive utility. Behaviour Vol. 112 (1990) pp. 246-269 EVOLUTIONARY DISSIPATION OF AN ANTISNAKE SYSTEM: DIFFERENTIAL BEHAVIOR BY CALIFORNIA AND ARCTIC GROUND SQUIRRELS IN ABOVE- AND BELOW-GROUND CONTEXTS RONALD 0. GOLDTHWAITE, RICHARD G. COSS and DONALD H. OWINGS Department of Psychology, University of California, Davis, California 95616 U.S.A. Arctic ground squirrels (Spermophilus parryii ablusus) have been free from snake predation for about 3 million years. To evaluate the effects of this prolonged relaxation of natural selection, lab-born Arc- tic ground squirrels were compared to snake-inexperienced California ground squirrels (Spermophilus beecheyi fisheri) from a habitat where rattlesnake and gopher snake predation is intense. Their behavior was video taped during 10-min encounters with a Pacific gopher snake (Pituophis melanoleucus catenifer) in a seminatural above-ground setting and in an artificial burrow. In separate trials, a domesticated Nor- way rat was used as a control for the effects of encountering a novel animate object; this rat was enclosed in a slowly moving opaque nylon bag above ground but was allowed to move freely below ground. No evidence was found that, after prolonged relaxed selection from snakes, Arctic ground squirrels retained the specialized behavioral antisnake defenses evident in California ground squirrels. Although we originally hypothesized that the more constrained burrow context might limit the evolutionary dissipation of behavioral antisnake defenses, we found no evidence of a more intact system in Arctic squirrels below than above ground. Arctic squirrels used many of the same general kinds of motor patterns as California squirrels, but in ways that failed to differentiate the gopher snake from the rat in either above- or below-ground contexts. In contrast, the California squirrels tail flagged only in the presence of the snake above ground and differentially applied substrate-throwing at the snake and rat burrow intruders, harassing the snake more than twice as much as the rat. Above ground, California ground squirrels were more conservative toward both adversaries than Arctic ground squirrels were, keeping their distance and therefore experiencing fewer noxious consequences, such as snake strikes. However, this result was context dependent. Below ground, California ground squirrels were more willing than Arctic ground squirrels to approach and harass both burrow intruders. Although repeated striking evoked occasional snake-directed substrate throwing above ground, Arctic ground squirrels never threw substrate at the snake in the burrow. In comparison with California ground squirrels, Arctic ground squirrels appear to enter their first gopher snake encounter with both a much lower assessment of the risk involved and less clearly defined knowledge about how to deal with these risks. We conclude that 3 million years of genetic drift has altered the cognitive system structuring the meaning of snakes to Arctic ground squirrels in various settings. Behaviour Vol.. 112 (1990) pp. 270-283 AGONISTIC COMMUNICATION IN SOCIAL SPECIES: WHAT IS COMMUNICATED? J.C. SENAR Museu de Zoologia, Ap. 593, 08003 Barcelona, Spain Relationships between displays used in agonistic encounters, the next behaviour of the reactor, and the actor's subsequent response, are analysed in captive siskins (Carduelis spinus). A three-way independence test showed that the different displays are associated with different replys. Factorial Analysis of Correspondences showed that 76% of the variability in the displays could be explained by variation in the tolerance of the actor to the presence of conspecifics: certain displays led to submissive or non-aggressive responses by the reactor which led to non-aggressive behaviours by the actor, whereas others frequently provoqued an attack, which usually led to a retaliatory attack by the actor. The degree of caution in the response appears to be the other factor that modulates the reactor's subsequent response. This degree of caution appears to be directly related to the relative dominance status of the contestants.</page><page sequence="202">844 VOLUME 112 These results support the view that in highly social species the aim of agonistic displays is not necessarily to drive opponents away, since this may be costly for both contestants. Agonistic communication in these situations should not be seen as an "auction" to determine who will obtain the resource, but as a warning, in which the actor gives information on how tolerant it is to the close presence of the conspecific and what behaviours it will allow. Depending on its status and behaviour, the second bird may be tolerated, but if it behaves in a "dangerous" way, the actor would attack. Behaviour Vol. 112 (1990) pp. 284-298 EXPOSURE TO PREDATORS AND ACCESS TO FOOD IN WINTERING WHITE-THROATED SPARROWS ZONOTRICHIA ALBICOLLIS WALTER H. PIPER Department of Biology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, 27599-3280, U.S.A. I studied a free-living population of white-throated sparrows (Zonotrichia albicollis) to determine which, among eleven behavioural, morphological and situational variables, were correlated with the distance from cover at which individuals fed (a presumed index of predation risk) and the amount of time they spent feeding at three observation sites. Time spent feeding was correlated only with dominance, an indication that dominant birds obtained greater access to high quality food. In contrast, an assortment of factors affected distance to cover. Individuals tended to feed far from cover if they were: (1) in large flocks, (2) males, (3) young and (4) subordinate. Distance to cover for the population as a whole increased during cold and cloudy conditions. The failure of dominance alone to determine a bird's distance to cover probably resulted in part from the confusion caused by dominant heterospecifics (e.g. cardinals, Cardinalis cardinalis) and from their apparent tendency to tolerate mainly small white-throated sparrows (which tended to be subordinate) feeding with them. Overall, this study indicates that while dominance clearly allows easy access to food, it is only one of several factors affecting exposure to predators. Behaviour Vol. 112 (1990) pp. 299-318 ONTOGENY OF FISH CAPTURE AND INGESTION IN FOUR SPECIES OF GARTER SNAKES (THAMNOPHIS) MONIQUE HALLOY and GORDON M. BURGHARDT Department of Psychology and Zoology, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996, U.S.A. The feeding behaviour of four species of garter snakes (Thamnophis butleri, T7 melanogaster, T radix, and T sirtalis) was observed in an attempt to determine differences across species and among age groups with respect to capturing, handling and swallowing large and small fish. Although belonging to the same genus, the four species differ widely in habitat and prey preferences (T butleri being recognized as an earthworm specialist, T melanogaster as an aquatic specialist, and the other two species as generalists). Overall, feeding patterns were quite similar across species following a general sequence of capturing fish, maneuvering the jaws to either the head or tail of the fish (the head being "chosen" more often), and swallowing it. Head-first ingestion was related to prey size: the larger the fish the greater the probability the snake would ingest it head first. When this behaviour was analysed more closely, species and age differences emerged. Adults were more efficient at capturing and ingesting fish head-first and took less time to handle and swallow their prey than did juveniles. This difference was not as marked in the two specialist species as in the two generalist species. Considering differences within species and age classes with respect to their handling behaviour of either a large or a small fish, T melanogaster handled both sizes of prey in a time period that was not significantly different, T butleri took significantly more time to handle a large fish whereas T radix and Ti sirtalis took considerably more time to handle a large fish as newborns but not as adults. These results support field observations that T melanogaster is an aquatic specialist, Ti butleri, an earthworm specialist, and the other two species, generalists. In spite of the similarities between the two generalist species, similarities were also found between T butleri and T radix which are believed to the taxonomically related.</page><page sequence="203">VOLUME 113 845 Behaviour Vol. 113 (1990) pp. 1-20 BROOD DIVISION AND PARENTAL CARE IN THE PERIOD BETWEEN FLEDGING AND INDEPENDENCE IN THE DUNNOCK (PRUNELLA MODULARIS) PHILIP A.F. BYLE Department of Zoology, University of Cambridge, Downing St, Cambridge, England 1. Brood division was observed in 12 out of the 21 broods of dunnocks. It was stable over the whole period of fledging to independence. 2. Undivided broods were significantly more likely to occur earlier in the season than divided broods. 3. Brood size had no significant effect on the age at which chicks reached independence. 4. The weight (on day 6) of chicks in undivided broods influenced the age at which they reached independence, but no significant relationship was found in divided broods. 5. The provision of extra food significantly reduced the age at which fledglings reached independence, indicating that territory quality may affect the timing of independence. The effects of extra food on brood division were unclear. 6. There was no differential splitting of the brood between the dominant male and the female in polyandry and polygynandry or between a monogamous male and his female. Males and females fed the chicks at similar rates. 7. Beta males who had helped to feed the nestlings were more likely to continue to help feed fledglings in larger broods. 8. There was a tendency for male parents to care for male offspring and female parents to care for female offspring. Behaviour Vol. 113 (1990) pp. 21-56 COMPARATIVE FINE STRUCTURE OF ACTION: RULES OF FORM AND SEQUENCE IN THE GROOMING PATTERNS OF SIX RODENT SPECIES KENT C. BERRIDGE Department of Psychology, Neuroscience Laboratory Building, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, U.S.A. The phylogenetic constancy of a set of syntactic patterning rules for grooming was examined in six rodent species: guinea pig. Belding's ground squirrel, gerbil, hamster, rat, mouse. Species were chosen to allow comparisons of separate suborders of Rodentia (Hystricomorpha, Sciuromorpha, Myomorpha) and of separate families within suborders (Cricetidae and Muridae). Each species was examined for possession of the syntactic patterns of chaining, transition reciprocity, sequential stereotypy, and hierarchical clustering. These syntactic patterns were detected and quantified using videoanalysis, graphic notation, and a variety of computer-assisted action coding and analysis techniques. Each syntactic pattern or sequencing rule mentioned above was found to obtain in all six of the species tested. The wide applicability of these rules suggests that they reflect a fundamental feature of neurobe- havioral organization, which was established relatively early in rodent evolution. Syntactic organization appears to be a basic property of action production by mammalian brains. The techniques used in this study also allowed a quantitative comparison to be made across species of syntactic pattern strength, form, stereotypy, and timing parameters. This comparison showed that many differences in behavioral patterns among species could be explained by one of two principles. The first explanatory principle was phylogenetic relationship: the behavioral traits of species from within a single family tended to be more similar than were traits of species from separate families, and species from a single suborder tended to be more similar than species from separate suborders. The second principle, which applied especially to temporal parameters, was programmed allometric control by physical size. The timing of patterns (for example, the cycle duration of certain highly stereotyped forepaw strokes performed on the face) was related to the average size of the species by an allometric power function. The nature of these syntactic patterns and of the rules that generate them, the nature of their neural substrates, and the origin of parameters differences between species, is discussed.</page><page sequence="204">846 VOLUME 113 Behaviour Vol. 113 (1990) pp. 57-80 THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG POPULATION DENSITY, INDIVIDUAL SIZE, MATING TACTICS, AND REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS IN A HERMAPHRODITIC FISH, SERRANUS FASCIATUS CHRISTOPHER W. PETERSEN Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, APO Miami 34002-0011 The hermaphroditic reef fish Serranus fasciatus exhibits three types of social systems. The size of a social group is correlated with the local density of conspecifics. At very low densities, isolated pairs of individuals reciprocally spawn with each other, achieving equal current reproductive success. At intermediate group sizes, harems form, with the largest individual typically losing all of its female function and becoming a functional male. In harems, subordinate hermaphrodites obtain little male reproductive success through streaking, an alternative male mating tactic. The lone pure male maintains almost total monopolization of male reproductive success in harems, apparently due to aggressive domination of subordinates. At high group sizes, the ability of the male to monopolize all of the matings in a social group decreases, and some of the larger hermaphrodites obtain some male-role reproductive success by pair spawning with smaller subordinate hermaphrodites while continuing to spawn as females with the male. Mating partners stay relatively constant through time, resulting in a pattern of small "sub-harems" within harems. These mating tactics are consistent with the hypothesis that dominant individuals increase their current reproductive success in this species by restricting male mating opportunities of conspecifics. Subordinate individuals spawn as males when the dominant is unable to restrict interactions between hermaphrodites that are potential mates, or when they successfully streak. The increased male reproductive success of hermaphrodites in isolated pairs and comples harems compared with hermaphrodites in harems appears to be important in maintaining a hermaphroditic subordinate phenotype in this largely non-reciprocating species.

Both isosexual dyads of females and heterosexual dyads frequently reach the stage of greatest social compatibility, i.e. grooming. Male dyads, in contrast, very rarely reach such stage, they show instead marked mutual intolerance and overt aggressive competition. Grooming and other forms of physical contact are fairly frequent between adult males in the patrilineal society of chimpanzees. In the hamadryas baboon, also with patrilineal organization, adult males do not groom with each other but they frequently exchange greeting interactions, particularly in contexts of excitement provoked by social tension. Species- specific differences (savanna versus desert baboons) in the morphology of greeting interactions have also been reported. The objective of this study was to examine the nature and function of this category of non- agonistic interactions recorded over a period of 9 years between 20 males members of a well-established colony of baboons, Papio hamadryas, P cynocephaus and their hybrids, housed in a large, open enclosure in the Madrid Zoo. Greetings were conceptualized as interactions, i.e. in which each participant's action is examined in relation to that of the other interacting partner. A description and qualitative analysis were provided of the morphology (i.e. facial, vocal, manipulatory and contact, postural and orientation, and locomotory patterns) and properties (i.e. reciprocity/non-reciprocity, and symmetry/asymmetry) of greeting interactions. The most significant feature of greeting interactions was the three-stage pattern of performance observed, corresponding with the phases of approximation, proximity, and retreat. In each phase, characteristic behavioural patterns were displayed, some were quite stereotyped but others seemed to be rather influenced by the identity of, and social relationship of, the interacting males, and also by the immediate social context of the interaction. A quantitative analysis of 1583 greeting interactions and 1039 aggressive episodes between the 20 study males was then carried out. Individual males were assigned to one of the following classes of reproductive status: subadult (SA), follower (FW), new leader (NL), prime leader (PL), old leader (OL), and old follower</page><page sequence="205">VOLUME 113 847 (OFW). It was found a correlation between a male's status class and the frequency with which he played several different roles in greeting and aggressive interactions. Greeting interactions were typical of mature males (FWs, NLs, PLs, OLs, and OFWs), but very especially of reproductive males (NLs, PLs, and OLs). Their rate of participation (both as initiator and recipient) was positively related both to the size of their harem (e.g. prime leaders) and to the potentiality to increase the harem size by taking over new females (e.g. prime and new leaders). Males at its prime reproductive period (i.e. PLs) showed the highest rates of involvement in symmetrical greetings, and the males who were reaching that stage (i.e. NLs) were the ones who most frequently refused to reciprocate a greeting approach. As males approached the stages of higher reproductive potential their rates of symmetrical, i.e. non-contact and notifying, greetings increased. In contrast, the contact patterns observed during asymmetrical greetings were mostly displayed in interactions in which at least one of the participants was either an immature or a young nonreproductive (i.e. follower) male. Reproductive males, i.e. prime and new leaders, were the most frequent initiators and recipients of both greeting and aggression. Examination of the morphology of greeting interactions, particularly of the symmetrical and unreciprocated greetings, i.e. the approach/retreat non-contact pattern, that were typical of prime and new leader males, and of the contexts in which both aggression and many greeting episodes took place, i.e. agonistic conflicts and competition over resources, suggested that these two categories of behaviour might share some causal factors and that they might be regarded as two alternative strategies to deal with a similar problem, namely, the resolution of conflicts. In many cases, greeting may be regarded as a quasi-aggressive behaviour aimed at testing a potential or actual rival's tendencies in a competition situation rather than as a category of affiliative or friendly behaviour. Greeting in baboons is a nice example of a non-stereotyped behaviour in a higher animal, in which relational and interactional properties can be studied, and in which, as discussed in the paper, all the traditional ethological issues of causation, development, function, and evolution can be addressed. Behaviour Vol. 113 (1990) pp. 117-170 REPRODUCTIVE TACTICS OF MALE SAVANNA BABOONS RONALD NOE and ALBERTHA A. SLUIJTER Laboratory of Comparative Physiology, University of Utrecht, The Netherlands The strongly related parameters rank, age and period-of-residence determine which reproductive tactics a savanna baboon male will use primarily. Baboon males go through the following phases with respect to the use of mating tactics, as they are longer in the group and thus grow older and, as a rule, drop in rank: Phase 1. Peripheral, relatively little social contact, low mating success, building up of a social bond with a few females. Phase 2. High mating success, based on individual fighting ability, social bonds mainly with females that are, or will soon be, sexually attractive. Phase 3, variant a. (Males that were very successful in Phase 2.) Considerable time devoted to guarding infants conceived in phase 2 and to the mothers of those infants. Mating activity dtops sharply compared to Phase 2. Phase 3, variant b. (Males that did not go through a very successful Phase 2). Low mating success through whatever tactic, relatively peripheral. Phase 4. Relatively high mating success, partly through collaboration with other males. Considerable time is invested in the care for potential offspring and their mothers. Phase 5. Diminishing share in the total mating activty in the group. The support for infants is spread over a relatively large class of infants conceived after immigration. Social contact with a large number of females. The data did not show the relation between agonistic rank and mating success predicted by ALTMANN'S priority-of-access model. A modification of the model is presented, which allows for coalition formation among males that are too low in rank to be successful on their own. This model could not fully explain, however, the exceptional success of some middle ranking males. The theory of Coalition games can give insight in the processes that lead to distributions of mating success that depart from the modified priority-of-acces model. The lack of agreement between the data and the original priority-of-access model cannot be explained by higher selectivity of the high ranking males. The only qualitative parameter of consorts obtained, according to which high ranking males had an advantage, is the time of the day on which mating activity takes place. This is a direct result of the way in which males obtain their consorts. Consorts are often formed in the sleeping trees during the night or in the early morning. In that situation single, strong males</page><page sequence="206">848 VOLUME 113 have an advantage in conflicts against coalitions of lower ranking males. Lower ranking males have a relative advantage later in the day, when conflicts are fought out on the ground.

To distinguish between sensory and motor components of deprivation and between short and long durations of isolation four different housing conditions were used: group housing of four individuals (G), short term isolation (8 h; SI), long term isolation (3-4 weeks; LI), and contact housing (C). After three weeks tetradic encounters of 15 min, each were performed in the open field. The time budget of the behaviour during the encounter sessions revealed significant differences between SIIG and LI/C. There were only minor differences between SI and G and between LI and C. In comparison to the former, the latter were nearly twice as active, preferred the proximity to conspecific, entered more often into the center of the arena, performed more playful and less resting behaviour, and revealed a higher probability of aggressive events mostly embedded in sequences of play. In regard to exploration and social investigation the differences were less expressed. Since the possibility to exchange communicative signals in C individuals did not alter their encounter behaviour compared to LI it was concluded that the motor component of deprivation rather than the sensory one accounts for the raised social motivation. The lower motivational level in non-deprived or shortly deprived animals was interpreted as effect of a negative feed back caused by social activity. Behaviour Vol. 113 (1990) pp. 187-204 TETRADIC ENCOUNTERS OF WISTAR RATS (RATTUS NORVEGICUS) AFTER SOCIAL DEPRIVATION: SEQUENTIAL AND TEMPORAL ORGANISATION OF BEHAVIOUR JOCHEN WOLFFGRAMM Institut fur Neuropsychopharmakologie, FU Berlin To achieve different states of social deprivation male young Wistar rats were housed under three conditions: group housing of four animals, individual housing (3-4 weeks), and contact caging. The influences of social deprivation on the sequential and temporal organisation of the behaviour were studied by means of tetradic encounters. Each encounter session took place in the open field, it comprised four individuals and lasted for 15 min. Although social deprivation caused marked differences in the composition of the behaviour by locomotor, social, and non-social actions the sequential and temporal relationships were nearly independent from housing. The same sequential transitions between the behavioural classes were preferred in all the housing groups: rest -* ambulation (the latter mutually connected to exploration) - social investigation -* play -* aggression and aggressive play. Concerning the temporal organisation the time intervals during which a certain class was preferably performed corresponded to each other among the housing groups. The characteristic temporal durations were specific for the respective class. Cross- correlative temporal relationships between behavioural subtypes also revealed no differences among the housing groups. Two types belonging to the same class (e.g. play) were mutually preferred in the temporal neighbourhood of the other one. Types attributed to different classes always revealed an avoidance of neighbouring occurrence. For classes which were not connected by a preferred sequential transition the avoidance was temporally symmetrical whereas in types which belonged to classes which preferably succeeded to each other the avoidance was asymmetrical. As far as regarded in this study the principles of sequential and temporal organisation of the behaviour were independent from housing conditions. Such invariance was interpreted as an expression of species-typical central nervous control systems which were not substantially affected by social deprivation. Hypothetical control components contributing to the guidance of behavioural "phases" are proposed.</page><page sequence="207">VOLUME 113 849 Behaviour Vol. 113 (1990) pp. 205-222 TETRADIC ENCOUNTERS OF WISTAR RATS (RATTUS NORVEGICUS) AFTER SOCIAL DEPRIVATION: INDIVIDUAL BEHAVIOURAL FEATURES JOCHEN WOLFFGRAMM and A. HEYNE Institut fuir Neuropsychopharmakologie, FU Berlin In young but adult male Wistar rats the individual behavioural interactions during tetradic encounters in the open field were studied after three weeks of differential housing. The purpose was to look for social roles within the tetrade an to investigate the influence of social deprivation on interindividual dif- ferentiation. Behavioural features of each individual were established according to the time budget of the behaviour, locomotor and spatial parameters, and the recipience of social interactions by the other members of the tetrade. The most ralible feature during repeated encounters was social recipience which revealed significant positive inter-session correlations in group housed (G), contact housed (C), and in- dividualy housed (LI) rats. Among the housing groups the highest level of inter-session correspondence concerning nearly all the features was found in C individuals. The existence of social roles was suggested by interfeature correlation analyses. "Clusters" of significantly correlating features were detected which revealed both correspondences and differences between the housing groups. Each social role was charac- terized by a particular cluster; three of such roles were established: social activity, social attractivity, and exploration of the environment. The latter cluster and its attributed role was only present in non-deprived rats (G). Social activity was characterized by high levels of play and social investigation, and proxim- ity to conspecifics whereas social attractivity was expressed by social recipience positively correlating to the performance of aggression and aggressive play. In LI individuals a discrimination between attractive and non-attractive animals developed some three minutes after the start of the encounter. Socially active rats preferred the proximity of attractive ones and tended to perform the same type of behaviour which the attractive one had shown during the last 30 seconds. C rats behaved in a similar way but a moderate inter-individual differentiation was detected already during the first minutes. In G role-specific differences were poorly expressed. In particular the behaviour of the active rat was less directed and related to the attractive animal. It is discussed to what extent social dominance expressing itself in playful interactions and social attractivity rather than in agonistic fight may be characteristic for establishing groups with an increasing degree of individual recognition.

Multivariate methods of analysis were used to establish the relationships existing between the various behavioural items chosen to describe individual behaviour, and the most characteristic profiles were determined by means of the dynamic clouds classification algo- rithm. Four main profiles were detected: sitting at the back of the nest, active general behaviour on the comb, foraging for prey, and building activity. Two factors seemed to have determined the development of the individual behavioural profiles: the order of emergence determined the active integration of indi- viduals into the colony; and the age-factor determined which behavioural profiles would be successively adopted by each wasp. A profile characterized by a high level of general activity on the comb was found to occupy a central position in the development of individual behaviour towards engagement in foraging activities.</page><page sequence="208">850 VOLUME 113 Behaviour Vol. 113 (1990) pp. 251-263 OVIPOSITION RESOURCES, TERRITORIALITY AND MALE REPRODUCTIVE TACTICS IN THE DRAGONFLY PALTOTHEMIS LINEATIPES (ODONATA: LIBELLULIDAE) JOHN ALCOCK Department of Zoology, Arizona State University, Tempe AZ 85287-1501, U.S.A. Males of the dragonfly Paltothemis lineatipes defend territories that contain potential oviposition sites for their mates. Males take females to an egg-laying spot after capturing them in flight. By covering natural sites and adding patches of fine gravel, one can manipulate the quantity of oviposition resources in male territories and thereby test a prediction from mating system theory: the quantity of resources in resource- based territories should affect male reproductive success. Counter to this prediction, male copulatory success is not affected by the quantity of oviposition material in male territories because females accept mating partners before assessing oviposition sites. Assessment does occur but only after the female has copulated and been released by her mate. Females released at large oviposition patches are more likely to oviposit in their mate's territory than females released at smaller patches of the key resource. However, males given a choice between taking mating partners to large or small experimental patches within their territories show only a moderate preference for the larger patch. Moreover, removal of experimental oviposition patches does not cause males to abandon defense of their territories. These results differ from those secured for another dragonfly with a resource-defense mating system. The differences between the species are related to the timing of female assessment of the oviposition resources and the degree to which females will accept marginal oviposition sites within a male's territory.

Social tension was derived from the frequency of displacement activities. Ten familiar pairs (the F group) and 20 unfamiliar pairs (the UF group) of adult female long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) were observed in a two-hour test. The UF group was divided into two subgroups on the basis of the establishment of clearcut dominance relations within the pairs (as revealed by bared-teeth displays). Unfamiliar pairs showing clearcut dominance relations (the UFa subgroup) did not differ from the F group in terms of grooming exchanged and displacement activities. Unfamiliar pairs wihtout clearcut dominance relations (the UFb subgroup) showed less grooming and more displacement activities. A delay in the onset of allogrooming due to unresolved dominance relations was responsible for the differences in social tension between the different monkey pairs. The results of this study suggest that unfamiliarity between the monkeys is not a good predictor of social tension if the patterns of behavioural interactions between the individuals are not taken into account.</page><page sequence="209">VOLUME 113 851 Behaviour Vol. 113 (1990) pp. 273-291 THE EFFECT OF SOME NON-SOCIAL FACTORS ON MOTHER-INFANT CONTACT IN LONG-TAILED MACAQUES (MACACA FASCICULARIS) GEA J. KARSSEMEIJER, DAVE R. VOS and JAN A.R.A.M. VAN HOOFF Unit of Ethology and Socio-ecology, Utrecht University, P.O. Box 80.086, 3508 TB Utrecht, The Netherlands Mother-infant dyads were studied among wild long-tailed macaques in North Sumatra (Indonesia). The influence of arboreality and mother's immediate activity on physical contact was examined during the first 5 months of infant life. Both factors were found to be contingent on the contact probability. It was suggested that mother long-tailed macaques might intensify protective behaviour when staying high in the canopy to prevent the infant from falling. Though mothers were very rarely observed rejecting their infants, the infants seemed to learn that they could be in or out of contact a particular times depending on their mother's activity. The development of this relationship is suggested to be based upon economical principles. Behaviour Vol. 113 (1990) pp. 292-308 THE REPRODUCTIVE BEHAVIOUR AND MATE CHOICE OF THE FIDDLER CRAB (UCA LACTEA LACTEA) IN MID-TAIWAN LUCIA LIU SEVERINGHAUS and HUI-CHEN LIN Institute of Zoology, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C This study took place between July 1985 and April 1986. Uca lactea lactea has a semi-lunar reproductive cycle. It was most active after spring tide when the ground was wet. The peak of mating frequency usually occurred two days after spring tide, but could be delayed by unsuitable weather conditions. The prominent display equipment, the major cheliped, and the conspicuous lateral waving as courtship behaviour were not essential to a male's mating success, while stroking at a female's burrow entrance was. Males which were persistent at stroking and courting one female at a time mated more times. Both sexes tended to mate with several partners. Copulations occurred between individuals occupying burrows near each other, but not necessarily adjancent to each other. Courting males were frequently interrupted by other males. Those who could chase away the intruders often succeeded in copulating. Male body size seems important in determining whether intruders can be expelled successfully. Burrow changes took place frequently and were usually initiated by larger individuals. Burrow changes may be an individual's effort at relocating to a better site for more successful mating. Nevertheless, males of different carapace sizes did not differ in the number of successful matings.</page><page sequence="210">852 VOLUME 114 Behaviour Vol. 114 (1990) pp. 3-20 THE BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY OF MATERNAL EFFORT IN FUR SEALS AND SEA LIONS FRITZ TRILLMICH Max-Planck Institut fur Verhaltensphysiologie, Abt. Wickler, D-8131 Seewiesen, FRG Otariid seals form a group of similar species distributed from subpolar to tropical seas. Many species were recently studied under conditions of low and high food abundance during major oceanographic disturbances. Evidence for the phenotypic flexibility of and constraints on the rearing strategy of these species derives from inter- and intra-specific comparisons and experimental measurements. I review how changes in food abundance influence foraging behavior and energetics of mothers, pup growth rates, milk composition, weaning age, and the fertility cost of pup rearing. Eared seal females rear young by alternating between lactation ashore and foraging at sea. Subpolar fur seals always wean pups at four month of age, a trait which seems to be genetically fixed and adaptive in their highly seasonal environment. Temperate and tropical fur seals and sea lions can respond to changes in food abundance by increasing or decreasing time to weaning. During pup rearing, mothers regulate body mass to different absolute values when abundance of food resources changes. This seems to be a constraint caused by reduced foraging efficiency at low food availability. Most species feed exclusively during the night, but sea lions (Zalophus californianus) and Northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) also forage during the day by diving deeper. Females of some species increase the rate of at-sea energy expenditure at low food abundance while keeping the duration of foraging trips constant. Females of other species stay at sea longer working at the same rate. The latter species may be food specialist with a narrower time window for efficient foraging. Pups grow slower when mothers increase time at sea, and at very low food abundance pups may starve. Pups have little influence on the duration of maternal foraging trips, but may diminish the mothers' time ashore by increasing the rate of milk extraction and prolonged non-nutritive sucking. The impact of long maternal at-sea times is reduced by increasing milk fat content as time at sea increases. This mechanism does not fully compensate pup energy intake rate for longer trip durations. Non-migratory species can partly compensate for reduced pup growth rates by lengthening the lactation period. In the Galapagos fur seal (A. galapagoensis), this entails a considerable cost to the mother by reducing her future fertility. Lactation reduces the probability of a successful simultaneous pregnancy and, if pregnancy succeeds, sibling competition for maternal milk ensues. Competition is usually won by the older sibling leading in many cases to the death of the newborn. The rate of energy transfer to pups is high in food-rich years and low in scarse ones. Because pups are more likely to be weaned as yearlings when juvenile growth rate is high than when it is low, high energy transfer to the pup in year "a" reduces the cost of reproduction incurred in year "a + 1". The flexibility of the rearing strategy of temperate and tropical species permits mothers to adjust phenotypically to variance in food availability thus partly masking the theoretically expected trade-offs in the life history of these species.

VISSER, JACQUES J.M. VAN ALPHEN and HENK W. NELL Department of Population Biology, University of Leiden, P.O. Box 9516, 2300 RA Leiden, The Netherlands An ESS model that predicts more superparasitism and longer patch times with an increasing number of searching parasitoids in a patch, was tested in experiments with Leptopilina heterotoma, a solitary larval parasitoid of Drosophila. The observed egg distributions and patch times were in quantitative agreement with the predictions of the model; oviposition and patch time decisions are clearly influenced by the number of conspecific in the patch. Both in the model and in the experiment patch quality was kept constant (the number of hosts and the patch area per parasitoid were kept constant). The model predicted and the experiments showed that parasitoids gain less offspring per unit of time when searching a patch together: superparasitism leads to mutual interference.</page><page sequence="211">VOLUME 114 853 No self-superparasitism should have occurred when parasitoids searched alone. This prediction was only met with females that had been kept in isolation in the days before the experiment; when stored in groups of four, self-superparasitism did occur. This indicates an ability of the parasitoids to assess the probability of future superparasitism by conspecifics. Behaviour Vol. 114 (1990) pp. 37-64 MEMORY FOR REWARD IN PROBABILISTIC CHOICE: MARKOVIAN AND NON-MARKOVIAN PROPERTIES DERICK G.S. DAVIS and J.E.R. STADDON Department of Psychology, Duke University, Durham, N. Carolina, U.S.A. 27706 Pigeons were rewarded with food for pecking keys in various forms of two-armed bandit situation for an extended series of daily sessions in two experiments. The average daily preference (S = R/[R + L]) is very well fit by a markovian linear model in which predicted preference today is an average of predicted preference yesterday and reinforcement conditions today: s(N + 1) = as(N) + (1 - a)A(N + 1), where A(N + 1) is set equal to 1 when all rewards are for the Right response, and 0 when all are for the Left, and a is a longterm memory parameter. This linear model explains some apparent paradoxes in earlier reports of memory effects in two-armed bandit experiments. Nevertheless, closer examination of the details of preference changes within each experimental session showed several kinds of non-markovian effects. The most important was a regression at the beginning of each experimental session towards a preference characteristic of earlier sessions (spontaneous recovery). This effect, but not a smaller, less reliable non-markovian reminiscence effect, is consistent with a very simple rule, namely that the effect on preference of each individual reward for a Right or Left response is inversely related to how long ago the reward occurred. Thus, animals learn to prefer the rewarded side each day because these rewards are recent; but they regress to earlier preference overnight because the most recent rewards become relatively less recent with lapse of time. Behaviour Vol. 1 14 (1990) pp. 65-82 OPTIMISTIC AND PESSIMISTIC FRUIT FLIES: EVALUATING FITNESS CONSEQUENCES OF ESTIMATION ERRORS BERNARD D. ROITBERG Behavioural Ecology Research Group, Department of Biological Sciences, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada, V5A 1S6 I began with an observation that there exists consistent variation among fruit-parasitic female flies (Rhago- letis pomonella) with regard to search time allocation. In essence, populations appear to be composed of flies that are "optimistic" and "pessimistic" about their chances of locating other higher quality patches. I posed the question "how can such variation be maintained over time?". To answer this question I devel- oped stochastic, dynamic, state-variable model that considered patch emigration decisions by individuals as a function of: (1) current patch quality, (2) average patch quality, (3) density of patches, (4) time of day, and, (5) egg load. The model was then altered to allow for optimistic and pessimistic estimates of patch availability. The optimal behaviour for such flies was then solved. Results obtained showed that optimists move more often within trees and pessimists move more frequently among trees. Further, calculation of daily reproductive output showed that both optimists and pessimists performed nearly as well as flies with errorless estimates of patch availability so long as over and under- estimates were moderate. This is because of the interaction between egg limitation, host availability and time limitation. When patch estimate errors were large (e.g. 90%), however, pessimists performed less well than optimists. These results allowed me to derive fitness curves for optimists and pessimists. These curves were then used to predict the distribution of search allocation by flies in the field. Predictions as to the shape of the distribution were consistent with field data (i.e. optimists are over-represented in samples).</page><page sequence="212">VOLUME 114 Behaviour Vol. 114 (1990) pp. 83-116 FAMILY PLANNING IN THE KESTREL (FALCO TINNUNCULUS): THE ULTIMATE CONTROL OF COVARIATION OF LAYING DATE AND CLUTCH SIZE SERGE DAAN and COR DIJKSTRA Zoological Laboratory, University of Groningen, P.O. Box 14, 9750 AA Haren, The Netherlands JOOST M. TINBERGEN Institute for Ecological Research, Boterhoekstraat 22, 6666 GA Heteren, The Netherlands The theory that individual birds maximize their fitness by the two major decisions in reproduction concern- ing date (when to start laying eggs) and clutch size (when to stop laying eggs) is empirically approached in the Kestrel by quantifying Ficher's Reproductive Value for both the clutch (Vc = c.Vo/2) and the parents (Vp). The reproductive value of an egg (Vo) was found to decrease monotonically with laying date (d) due to significant associations with d of the components So (probability for an egg to survive till fledging), SI (probability to survive from fledgling till age 1), S2 (survival age 1 till age 2), and Pi (probability of breeding at age 1). Vp declined negligibly with laying date, although there were significant associations between d (laying date) and N (probability of the nest to produce at least one fledging), Pr (probability of a repeat clutch following nest failure), and La (probability of local survival of the parents following breeding). In experiments where brood size at day 10 after hatching was increased or reduced, Vc increasing experi- mental brood size, while Vp simultaneously decreased. Total reproductive value (V = Vc + Vp) remained unaffected by the experiments. This result suggests that a rather broad range of clutch sizes maximizes total reproductive value, as far as detectable by the data. While the yield of kestrel hunting, and hence the number of young raisable with constant parental effort (and constant Vp), increased with the spring increase in vole population density, reproductive value of the clutches decreases. For any particular food situation (hunting yield) this leads to a unique combination of clutch size and laying date maximizing V. This could be worked out by calculating fitness contours for all combinations and for different yields (Fig. 12). The optimal solutions are on a declining slope, with smaller clutches associated with later dates. 59.4% of all clutches observed obeyed the maximization criteria. Furthermore, there was a reasonable, unbiased association between predicted laying dates and clutch sizes based on individual male hunting yields and observed dates and clutches as laid by the females. Qualitatively, any method predicts a seasonal decrease in the optimal clutch size when the environment improves while reproductive value declines with progressive date. Preliminary results from an experimental approach to test the assumption of a causal effect of date on Vo, using the release of juvenile kestrels reared in captivity under artificial light schedules, are presented.

Box 14, 9750 AA Haren, The Netherlands MICHAEL HALL A.R.C. Research Group on Photoperiodism and Reproduction, Department of Zoology, University of Bristol, BS8 1UG, U.K. The time in spring when a male kestrel rapidly increases his daily hunting time and his hunting yield, and thereby the amount of food delivered to the female, determines the date when she lays the first egg. Food experiments in free-living and captive kestrels gave a significant advance in laying date. Clutch size, which decreases with progressive laying date, did not change independent of date in response to food manipulation. These effects are in agreement with most other feeding experiments. Photoperiod experiments in kestrels advanced the reproductive cycle in constant long days, and a similar seasonal decline in clutch size was found. It seems that there is an internally preprogrammed decrease in clutch size within an annual "reproductive window". A proximate control model for the seasonal decline of clutch size is proposed, modified from an earlier model by HAFTORN (1985). This incorporates an increasing 854</page><page sequence="213">VOLUME 114 855 tendency to incubate the first eggs with progression of the season, an egg contact-incubation positive feedback loop, and the resorption of further follicles in the ovary when the laying female incubates 50% of the time. This follicle resorption fixes the clutch size ca. four days before the last egg is laid. The 50% incubation level is reached earlier in late females and consequently resorption starts earlier and the resulting clutch is smaller than in early females. Experiments in kestrels with removal and addition of eggs, in combination with measurements of incubation behaviour are discussed in relation to the model. Plasma prolactin data of female kestrels show that this hormone is a serious candidate for a physiological component relaying time of year in our model for clutch size regulation.

GODFRAY Department of Biology and Centre for Population Biology, Imperial College at Silwood Park, Ascot, Berkshire, SL5 7PY, U.K. 1) Sex ratio theory has assumed that females can produce offspring of both sexes. It has been suggested that some females in haplodiploid populations are only able to produce sons (constrained sex allocation), for example because they are virgin. The presence of such females influences the optimal sex ratio of unconstrained females. The relevance of these ideas to field sex ratios is largely untested. 2) The frequencies of constrained oviposition in three Drosophila parasitoid species are estimated. Con- strained, ovipositing females were distinguished by the absence of sperm in the spermatheca. Constrained females were absent or rare in these species. 3) We review data from the literature that allow an estimate of the frequency of constrained females. 4) We conclude that the available evidence suggests that while constrained oviposition is uncommon, there are some species in which constrained females are sufficiently common to select for an observable sex ratio bias by unconstrained females.

Box 9516, 2300 PA Leiden, The Netherlands It is argued that connectionist models (neural nets, parallel distributed processing systems) have a great potential for changing our perspectives on animal behaviour. The approach is more structure-oriented than the conventional explanation by analogy. The method is used to analyze the principles of organization underlying oviposition decisions of parasitic wasps. Behaviour Vol. 114 (1990) pp. 161-190 FAMILY PLANNING IN THE GREAT TIT (PARUS MAJOR): OPTIMAL CLUTCH SIZE AS INTEGRATION OF PARENT AND OFFSPRING FITNESS JOOST M. TINBERGEN Institute for Ecological Research, Boterhoeksestraat 22, 6666 GA Heteren, The Netherlands SERGE DAAN Zoological Laboratory, University of Groningen, P.O. Box 14, 9570 AA Haren, The Netherlands Fitness variations due to natural variation in the size of the first clutch and its laying date were estimated using Fisher's reproductive value for both the clutch (Vc) and the parent (Vp) in a population of great tits. In order to test the hypothesis that individual birds maximize their reproductive value by the choice of clutch size, artificial variation in brood size was introduced and the consequences in term of reproductive value estimated. Maximal Vc, computed on the basis of natural variation in clutch size, occurred at a clutch size of 15.2, and increased slightly with laying date (Fig. 1A). Vp increased with natural variation in clutch size and</page><page sequence="214">856 VOLUME 114 decreased with date (Fig. iB). The total reproductive value V (= Vc + Vp) was maximal at a clutch size of 15.4 (Fig. IC), substantially higher than the population mean clutch size (9.2). The components of the reproductive value of the clutch (Vc) that were negatively affected by manipulation were the survival of the nestlings and the recruitment rate. The reproductive value of the parent (Vp) was negatively affected only through the probability of having a second clutch. Maximal Vc computed on basis of artificial variation in clutch size, occurred at a clutch size of 10.0, and also increased with date (Fig. ID). Vp decreased with artificial variation in clutch size (Fig. IE) causing the clutch size maximizing reproductive value V to shift to a value of 9.4 (Figs IF, 3), very close to the population mean clutch size (9.2). It is concluded that the majority of great tits produces the number of eggs (9-10) that maximizes their individual fitness, even though those individual birds laying 15 eggs have the highest reproductive value in the population. The fact that birds laying very large clutches have the highest reproductive value points in the direction of a selection pressure towards larger clutches. Yet, over the last 30 years clutch sizes have not increased in the study population. This apparent contradiction is discussed. Either no genetic variation in clutch size is involved, or a complex polymorphism exists. Behaviour Vol. 114 (1990) pp. 191-205 FOOD, SEX, TIME, AND EFFORT IN A SMALL MAMMAL: ENERGY ALLOCATION STRATEGIES FOR SURVIVAL AND REPRODUCTION GLENN PERRIGO Division of Biological Sciences, 105 Lefevre Hall, University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri 6521 1, U.S.A. The relationship between food energy and work effort (foraging) is crucial to small mammals such as the house mouse (Mus domesticus). Energy allocation process were studied by using a special caging system in which animals were required to work for 45 mg food pellets by running on an activity wheel. Two experimental themes were investigated: 1) When weaning female mice were forced to work harder for less food, their highest energy allocation priority was to maintain fat reserves; body growth was next in importance while achieving puberty had the lowest priority of all. The relative insensitivity of fat deposition to high foraging costs suggests a strategy for survival whereby dispersing animals maintain emergency fat reserves at the expense of growth and fertility. In male mice, however, reproductive development is independent from body growth. Both sexes employed fundamentally different energy allocation strategies during peripubertal development. Some of these sex differences were gonad-dependent, while others were not. The time spent foraging while exposed to cold ambient temperature is also critical during peripubertal development, and this relationship probably determines whether or not house mice will breed continuously or seasonally in feral habitats. 2) Deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) and house mice were challenged to produce litters at increasingly greater work requirements. Deer mice supported heavier litters and produced more pups at weaning than house mice, mainly because deer mice were more efficient at food use. With regard to circadian organization, deer mice accomplished almost all of their locomotor tasks during darkness while house mice exhibited day-to-day flexibility in locomotor activity, especially during lactation. Deer mice attempted to wean five or six pups, regardless of how severe the feeding conditions; however, pups became progressively stunded as females worked harder and obtained less food. In contrast, house mice had more pups at birth than deer mice, but females killed and cannibalized offspring throughout the first 12 days of lactation. Most surviving house mouse pups thus attained similar body weights at weaning. These divergent energy allocation patterns may reflect strategies arising from opportunism (house mice) versus seasonality (deer mice).

Horseshoe crabs have an explosive breeding system not unlike that of some frogs and toads. They synchronize nesting to only a few hours each day at the time of the spring new and full-moon high tides. Males search for females as they come to the breeding beaches, grasp them with specially modified claws</page><page sequence="215">VOLUME 114 857 and cling to them, sometimes for weeks. Females lay several clutches of eggs in the sand and the male fertilizes them externally, the only extant arthropod with such a reproductive system. Unattached males cluster around the nesting couple, pushing on and occasionally displacing attached males. An experimental manipulation demonstrated that satellite males are capable of fertilizing eggs which suggests that sperm competition in the primary explanation for the presence of unattached males on the beach. Like other explosively breeding species, male Limulus search for females, often grabbing inappropriate objects, and satellite males compete for access to females. There is little assortative mating and attached and unattached males do not differ in size. In extreme explosively breeding species like Limulus, selection favors those males that are best able to locate and remain attached to females, and there is little opportunity for female choice or male-male competition. Behaviour Vol. 114 (1990) pp. 221-231 COPYING THE MATE CHOICE OF OTHERS? OBSERVATIONS ON FEMALE BLACK GROUSE JACOB HOGLUND and ARNE LUNDBERG Dept. of Zoology, Uppsala University, Box 561, S-751 22, Uppsala, Sweden RAUNO V. ALATALO Dept. of Biology, University of Jyvaskyla, Ylionpistonkatu 9, SF-40100, Jyvaskyla, Finland It has been suggested that the non-random mating often observed in lekking species is a consequence of either male-male competition or active female mate choice. Here we show that the highly skewed mating distribution observed in a black grouse lek in three years were indeed different from random expectations. We suggest that females copying the mate choice of others enhance this skew. Observations in favour of copying are: females pay multiple visits to the lek during several days; females arrive and move in bands which makes it possible to observe the visits to male territories and matings of other females; in the main lek in the study area, males often mated in sequence indicating that by being visited by many females and by mating the attractiveness of males increased. However, this last effect was only evident in one of the years of the study, and only on the largest lek which had exceptionally many female visits this year. In leks with a smaller number of visiting females, copying, even if present, is difficult to detect without experiments since almost all females tend to copulate with the top-male.

KRISTINE JOHNSON, RANDY THORNHILL and J. DAVID LIGON Department of Biology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131, U.S.A. The morphology and parasite burdens of culled free-ranging red jungle fowl (Gallus gallus) from the San Diego Zoo were compared with those of captive roosters used previously in sexual selection experiments, to determine if results obtained with the captive birds were relevant to more natural situations. Zoo roosters had three helminth gut parasites: Ascaridia galli, tapeworms, and Heterakis. Parasite distribution was generally over-dispersed, with most individuals having none or few worms and some having heavy parasite burdens. These levels were comparable to those artificially induced in test roosters. The appearance of the zoo birds was similar to test roosters as well. Higher parasite burdens in the zoo birds was negatively related to hackle feather redness, comb length, and especially testis volume. The latter finding is discussed in light of information about the relationship between testosterone levels, sexual selection, and the immune system. A new analysis of female choice of uninfected controls versus experimentally infected roosters suggests that females prefer a multivariate array of traits perceived as a continuous, rather than categorical, variable.</page><page sequence="216">858 VOLUME 114 Behaviour Vol. 114 (1990) pp. 249-276 EVOLUTION OF NONVISUAL COMMUNICATION AND PHOTOPERIODIC PERCEPTION IN SPECIATION AND ADAPTATION OF BLIND SUBTERRANEAN MOLE RATS EVIATAR NEVO Institute of Evolution, University of Haifa, Mount Carmel, Haifa 31999, Israel The evolution of vocal and vibrational communications and photoperiod perception in the blind subter- ranean mole rat of the Spalax ehrenbergi superspecies, are reviewed in the context of adaptation and active speciation in the subterranean ecotype. Progressive evolution of the acoustic system and regres- sive evolution of the atrophied eye coupled with progressive evolution in photoperiodic perception and biorhythmicity systems, are discussed. Prospects are suggested for future research at the molecular, anatomical and organismal levels, in the twin evolutionary processes of adaptation and speciation. Spalax appears to be a uniquely productive evolutionary model for the study of evolutionary structural reductions and hypertrophies as well as functional shifts in evolution. It provides particularly a rich observational and experimental material to critically evaluate the challenges recently levelled against the synthetic theory of evolution concerning gradualism in speciation, the "adaptationist programme", and the role of natural selection as a creative force in evolution.</page><page sequence="217">VOLUME 115 859 Behaviour Vol. 115 (1990) pp. 1-13 EFFECT OF GENOTYPE AND LITTER SIZE ON DISCRIMINATION OF MOTHERS BY THEIR TWELVE-HOUR-OLD LAMBS R. NOWAK and D.R. LINDSAY School of Agriculture (Animal Science), University of Western Australia, Nedlands, Western Australia 6009 The ability of 12-h-old Border Leicester x Merino (BL x M) and pure Merino (M) lambs to seek a ewe and to discriminate their mothers from alien dams was tested in a two choice situation. When released in a triangular enclosure at 6 m from two penned ewes placed next to each other, most lambs reached a ewe before the end of the 5-min test. BL x M lambs were more attracted to the ewes than M lambs and could better discriminate their own mothers from alien dams. Although BL x M lambs were heavier than M lambs, the differences observed were mainly related to an effect of breed rather than to birth weight. There were no significant differences due to litter size or sex within each breed. On the other hand the differences between breeds were more marked in multiple than in single born lambs. This suggests the existence of an interaction between breed and litter size in the behavioural performances of very young lambs. It is concluded that young lambs can take an active part very early in life in the normal development of selective mother-young relationships. Also, 12 hours after birth, single and multiple BL x M lambs can discriminate between their own and alien mothers better than M lambs. Behaviour Vol. 115 (1990) pp. 14-29 LAMB'S BLEATS: IMPORTANT FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE MOTHER-YOUNG BOND? R. NOWAK School of Agriculture (Animal Science), University of Western Australia, Nedlands, Western Australia, 6009 Border Leicester x Merino (BL x M) lambs can discriminate between their own and alien mothers better than Merino (M) lambs when born to the same breed of dam (M). The behaviour of newborn lambs was therefore observed in different situations to investigate the reason for these better discriminative abilities of the BL x M lambs. In a first experiment lambs were removed from the ewe at birth and tested for 2 h under one of the following conditions: 1) reunited with its dam, 2) in the presence of a stationary model, 3) isolated. Overall the ewe had a stimulating effect on the motor activity of the neonate and a quietening effect on its vocal activity when compared to the other 2 groups, but these effects differed according to the genotypes. When isolated or in the presence of the model, BL x M lambs stood for the first time later than M lambs and spent less time standing and exploring the environment. In both situations BL x M lambs vocalised less than M lambs. When mothered, BL x M lambs stood up and found the teat later than M lambs but their motor and exploratory activity did not differ after 2 h of observation. However, mothered BL x M lambs were far more vocal than mothered M lambs. This suggests that BL x M lambs establish better communication with their dams. A second experiment was carried out on M lambs to investigate the existence of a relationship between the vocal activity of the neonate and the development of a bond with the mother. Results showed that the lambs that were the most vocal at birth also had the best performances in a test of mother discrimination at the age of 12 h. It was concluded that early communication between the ewe and her young probably plays a role in the establishment of a preferential bond.</page><page sequence="218">860 VOLUME 115 Behaviour Vol. 115 (1990) pp. 30-62 THE EVOLUTION OF MONOGAMY IN LARGE PRIMATES: A NEW HYPOTHESIS AND SOME CRUCIAL TESTS C.P. VAN SCHAIK Ethology and Socioecology, Laboratory of Comparative Physiology, University of Utrecht, P.O. Box 80086, 3508 TB Utrecht, The Netherlands R.I.M. DUNBAR Department of Anthropology, University College London, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England Monogamy among the large primates is not accompanied by high levels of male care for infants. The selective pressures that have led to its evolution in this case are far from clear. In this paper, we evaluate and test four different hypotheses. Monogamy in these species did not evolve because males are unable to defend access to more than one female. Hence, it must be related to behavioural services provided by the male which substantially increase the female's reproductive output. Existing data argue against the suggestion that these services involve protection against predators of defence of an exclusive feeding area. We propose that the male's service consists primarily in protecting the female against infanticide by other males. Tests that would differentiate this hypothesis unequivocally from other hypotheses are suggested. To the extent that these predictions can be tested with the data currently available, the evidence supports the infanticide hypothesis. We speculate that infanticide avoidance is also responsible for the near-universal occurrence among primates of male-female bonds. Behaviour Vol. 115 (1990) pp. 63-99 INTRASPECIFIC VARIATION IN SOCIAL REPERTOIRES: EVIDENCE FROM CAVE- AND BURROW-DWELLING LITTLE BLUE PENGUINS JOSEPH R. WAAS Department of Zoology, University of Canterbury, Christchurch 1, New Zealand 1. Breeding habitat variation in little blue penguin agonistic behaviour is correlated with environmental heterogeneity. 2. Cave-dwellers nested in tight colonial aggregations and had no physical barriers between nest sites. Burrow-dwellers nested as solitary pairs or in loose aggregations and were physically isolated from one another. 3. Cave-dwellers had significantly higher agonistic interaction rates than burrow-dwellers. 4. Cave-dwellers used a total of 22 distinct agonistic behaviours with 54 variations. Burrow-dwellers used a total of 13 agonistic behaviours with 29 variations. Variations on base behaviour were primarily the result of differences in vocal accompaniment. 5. Both cave- and burrow-dwellers used growl, low bray, medium bray, full bray, aggressive bark and aggressive yell vocalizations during agonistic behaviour. Only burrow-dwellers used a hiss vocalization. 6. Despite variation between cave- and burrow-dweller repertoires, many agonistic behaviours were very similar in form (posture, duration, movement, presence or absence of vocal components) and/or context (distance from the opponent when performing the behaviour, proportion of interactions involving the behaviour). 7. Repertoires from both habitats could be divided into three discrete categories: defensive behaviour, offensive behaviour, and overt aggression. For each habitat, the defensive behaviour category could be divided into stationary and distance increasing behaviour; the offensive behaviour category could be divided into stationary, distance reducing, and contact behaviour; and the overt aggression category could be divided into distance reducing and contact behaviour. 8. Cave-dwellers used twice as many defensive behaviours, twice as many offensive behaviours, and the same number of overtly aggressive behaviours as burrow-dwellers. 9. In both habitats, defensive behaviour was used most when the opponent was nearby (&lt; 1 m to 1- 2 m), whereas stationary offensive behaviour was performed most when opponents were further away (2-3 m to &gt; 3 m). Distance reducing behaviour (both offensive and overt) was performed most at middle interaction distances (1-2 m to 2-3 m) in both habitats. 10. Males were involved in a higher proportion of agonistic interactions than females in both-habitats.</page><page sequence="219">VOLUME 115 861 11. Burrow-dwellers used the overt behaviour Attack significantly more than cave-dwellers and also used the most dangerous fighting method more commonly than cave-dwellers. Burrow-dwellers also bit and fought significantly longer than cave-dwellers. 12. An egg transfer experiment (i.e. between cave and burrow colonies) indicated that chicks may not be genetically bound to the use of a habitat-specific repertoire of agonistic behaviours. 13. Four possible mechanisms are suggested for the origin of variation between habitats: (1) genetic influences; (2) phenotypic modulation; (3) experience; and (4) circumstantial influences. 14. Plastic agonistic behaviour may allow immediate and potentially adaptive phenotypic change in re- sponse to environmental heterogeneity. The large cave repertoire may reduce the chances of any one interaction ending with overt aggression. The smaller burrow-dweller repertoire may be sufficient to defend the physically enclosed burrow nest sites.

ANDY SNEDDEN Department of Biological Sciences, Brock University, St. Catharines, Ontario L2S 3A1 Canada The large chelipeds of male Orconectes rusticus have an adaptive function related to intermale competition for mates. Large clawed males dominate over smaller clawed, but otherwise physically similar, competi- tors. Additionally, males with large chela are better able to secure, and more quickly orient, females into the copulatory position. Large clawed males also copulate for longer periods that smaller clawed com- petitors. The significance of copulation duration is unclear, but is likely related to mate guarding. Sexual selection for increased cheliped size in 0. rusticus has been more intense on males than females. Sperm of the second male to inseminate a dually mated female takes precedence over that of the previous male. The paternity attributable to the second male was determined as approximately 92%.

Aiguier, 13402 Marseille, France PHILIPPE CERDAN Laboratoire de Zoologie Evolutive, Universite de Provence, 3 Place Victor Hugo, 13331 Marseille, France Colonies of Messor barbarus are monogynous. At the laboratory, it is possible to form polygynous colonies. This experimental model was used to study the influence of the number of queens on the degree of colony closure: are polygynous colonies more frequently open than monogynous ones? Experiments in which alien workers were transferred between monogynous and polygynous colonies showed that the latter had a lower degree of closure. The queen might pay a major role in the recognition processes between individuals belonging to either the same or different colonies.

Drakes were ranked according to the extent of naturally occurring blemishes (deviations from the plumage of an ideal drake) and introduced, two at a time, to a resident group of female "adjudicators", who would choose drakes by following one of them and/or by performing aggressive acts against one or both. We could predict the outcome in almost every case. In other experiments we could influence female choice by making attractive drakes ugly or unattractive ones more beautiful by means of</page><page sequence="220">862 VOLUME 115 staining and bleaching. The success in these experiments of isolating the effects of plumage quality from the many other factors which usually influence mate choice in females was a consequence of the drakes' apparent lack of interest in the females to whose pen they were introduced for a short time only. When several females chose the same good looking male, intense rivalry and aggressive behaviour occurred among the females. The possible effect of such rivalry on female mate choice was briefly examined; it appeared to be unimportant in our experiments.

SLATER Department of Biology &amp; Preclinical Medicine, University of St Andrews, Fife KY16 9TS, U.K. C.K. CATCHPOLE Department of Biology, Royal Holloway &amp; Bedford New College, Egham, Surrey TW20 OEX, U.K. The two chaffinch species on Tenerife (Fringilla teydea and E coelebs tintillon) were tested with playback of their own and the other species song in areas where only one of the two occurs. They were also tested in this non-overlap zone with the song of the European chaffinch (F c. gengleri was used) to test the hypothesis that they would respond more to it than to the competing species as their songs appear to have diverged from the European form in opposite directions. The results were broadly in line with this prediction. Playback of teydea and tintillon song in the zone of overlap between the two species led to heterospecific response in only a few cases, indicating that they are not usually inter-specifically territorial. Response to the other species song was less strong than outside the area of overlap, suggesting that habituation may lead birds to respond less to the other species where it is present. Behaviour Vol. 115 (1990) pp. 153-174 UNIDIRECTIONALITY IN THE PHYLOGENY OF SOCIAL ORGANIZATION, WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO BIRDS JOHAN G. VAN RHIJN Zoological Laboratory, University of Groningen, The Netherlands, and Department of Sciences, Open University, Heerlen, The Netherlands Ecological explanations for the diversity in parental care patterns and social organization in certain taxo- nomic groups of birds are not fully satisfactory. They need to be supplemented by phylogenetic explana- tions. In this article I discussed some aspects of the latter type of explanations, especially the difference between probabilities of certain evolutionary transitions occurring in the one and in the opposite direction. To explain the diversity in parental care and mating patterns in waders and related groups, I presented a model on the phylogenetic pathways in the evolution of parental care and social organization in birds. It departs from an ancestral state with pure male parental care which may evolve via "uniparental care" (male cares, but female care if male deserts) and "double clutching" towards biparental care with similar roles, polyandry and pure female parental care (polygyny, promiscuity). I have argued that certain transitions in this model (especially those from uniparental care and double clutching towards biparental care with similar roles and towards pure female parental care) may easily occur in the given direction, but not in the opposite one. The model predicts that pure male parental care and related patterns may be preserved in various lineages and may be associated with several other patterns in related species. It also predicts that pure female parental care is, in many instances, a final stage in the evolution, and hence quite often combined with pure female parental care in related species. To investigate the value of the model I tested its predictions for the phylogenetic trees of (1) arctic sandpipers, (2) the complete order of Charadriiformes, and (3) birds in general. All predictions were met. To investigate the likelihood of the model I considered to what extent predictions by alternative models were met. These model either ignored the effect of phylogenetic factors, or departed from alternative ancestral stages. The fit of the data seemed to be bad with the predictions of all of these models. Thus, the original model presented in this article must be considered as a probable reflection of the phylogeny of parental care and social organization in birds.</page><page sequence="221">VOLUME 115 Behaviour Vol. 115 (1990) pp. 175-187 MISE EN EVIDENCE D'UNE FORME D'APPRENTISSAGE DANS LE COMPORTEMENT DE CAPTURE DES PROIES CHEZ PACHYCONDYLA (= NEOPONERA) VILLOSA (FORMICIDAE, PONERINAE) ALAIN DEJEAN and BRUNO CORBARA Laboratoire d'Ethologie et Sociobiologie, URA C.N.R.S.

The Rhinotermitidae workers, on the other hand, are antennated during capture. While washing the soldiers and then soaking then in water used for washing workers, the posture of "prudence" on the part of the P villosa may be removed. Reciprocally, in washing the workers and soaking them in water used for washing soldiers, the postural response may be induced. Thus, there is a cuticular product coming out of the soldier which acts as a kairomone on the P villosa workers. Workers changing from internal service to hunting activities were put in the presence of live and active soldiers and of anaesthetized soldiers of termites. At the time of the first encounter the soldiers are antennated. At the time of the second encounter, there are only active soldiers. Ants that have already been in contact with active soldiers reveal the postural response, whereas those that have been in contact with anaesthetized soldiers continue to examine by antennation. They manifest the posture of "prudence" only when there is an additional contact. There is therefore a sort of apprenticeship where the "prudence" response is only acquired after a first contact when the ant is aggressed by a soldier. Behaviour Vol. 115 (1990) pp. 188-202 REPRODUCTIVE COSTS ARISING FROM INCOMPLETE HABITAT SEGREGATION AMONG THREE SPECIES OF LEUCORRHINIA DARGONFLIES FRED SINGER Bell Museum of Natural History, Department of Ecology and Behavioral Biology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, U.S.A. Three species of Leucorrhinia dragonflies show extensive temporal and spatial overlap in their use of mating grounds. This sets the stage for potentially costly interspecific interactions during mating and subsequent oviposition. Males frequently attempt to mate with heterospecific females, but prolonged in- terspecific matings are uncommon. Males guard ovipositing mates against takeovers by intruding males. Guarding males were as likely to chase heterospecific intruders as conspecific intruders during the ovipo- sition period. Males incurred considerable reproductive cost from this lack of species discrimination; 29% of the successful takeovers by conspecifics occurred while males were chasing heterospecific intruders. One hypothesis for lack of species discrimination in this group is that effective discrimination would re- quire a time investment by the quarding male while he assessed the species identity of the intruder. During this assessment period, the guarding male would risk losing his female to the intruder. Behaviour Vol. 115 (1990) pp. 203-246 BEHAVIOURAL CHANGES AT ADOLESCENCE IN CHIMPANZEES ANNE E. PUSEY Department of Ecology, Evolution and Behavior, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, U.S.A. Male chimpanzees experience puberty (marked testicular growth and ejaculation) when they are about 9 years old and just over half adult weight. They reach adult weight at 14-15 years. Females start small sexual swellings at about 8 years, mate with adult males when they are about 10.5 years and have their first infants when they are about 12 years. Males reduce their constant association with their mothers when they reach puberty and associate more with adult males and cycling females. Some males form 863</page><page sequence="222">864 VOLUME 115 strong, longlasting associations with particular adult males. Females remain with their mothers until first oestrus, and then associate with adult males either in their natal community or a new community during oestrus. The decline in association with the mother is more closely correlated with pubertal stage than with chronological age in both sexes. Immatures of all ages spend 3-13% of their time in social grooming, but grooming partners change during adolescence. Juveniles of both sexes groom their mothers and siblings most, but males groom individuals outside their maternal unit more than do females. Juveniles receive over 90% of their grooming from mothers and siblings. Adolescent males groom less with their mothers and more with cycling females and adult males. While early adolescent males start to be groomed by females only late adolescent males receive any grooming from adult males. Adolescent females without mothers groom little except with adult males when they are in oestrus. Social play is most frequent with individuals aged 2-9 years and individuals play most with others of their age. Time spent playing by both sexes declines markedly during adolescence. Juveniles and early adolescents of both sexes have friendly interactions with infants, but late adolescents rarely interact with infants. Males show frequent sexual behaviour with oestrous females from an early age. Males spend more time with oestrous females as they get older but frequency of copulation declines gradually through adolescence. Early adolescent males try to take females on consort, but only late adolescent males succeed. One female rejected the sexual advances of a male once he reached puberty. Rates of interference in copulations by males decline during adolescence and males become more cautious of copulating in the presence of adult males. Females show little sexual behaviour until they start getting large oestrus swellings. Males receive increased aggression from adult males during adolescence. They become tense in the presence of adult males and even late adolescents are peripheral to grooming clusters of adult males. Males start to challenge adult females in adolescence but are often attacked, and are not able to dominate them all until late adolescence. Male juveniles perform elements of charging displays without hair erection more frequently than females. The frequency of this declines in adolescence while the frequency of charging displays with hair erection by males increases in adolescence and displays become increasingly more adult-like in length and form. Males show the shoulder hunch for the first time in early adolescence. Males pant hoot more than females and rates of pant-hooting increase with age in both sexes. Behaviour Vol. 1 15 (1990) pp. 247-253 AVOIDANCE OF MALE GIANT WATER STRIDERS BY FEMALES JAMES J. KRUPA, WILLIAM R. LEOPOLD and ANDREW SIH School of Biological Sciences, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40506-0225, U.S.A. Shifts in behaviour and microhabitat preference were exhibited by female giant water striders (G. remigis) when males were experimentally introduced into and removed from wading pools containing females. In the presence of males, females became significantly less active, interacted with one another less, spent less time in open water, and spent more time out of the water away from females. Furthermore, they resumed their original behaviours once males were removed. It is potentially advantageous for females to avoid male harassment due to costs associated with such interactions.

Focal squirrels were much more likely to approach aggressively, attack, or chase their opponents, and the latter much more likely to retreat, after the focal squirrels had screeched than when they did not screech. I interpret the screech as a threat call that honestly signals a territory owner's intention to chase out an intruder. The rattle, which SMITH (1978) considered to function in territorial defence, was not associated with aggression from the caller when used independently of the screech. It was significantly associated with courting approaches by males towards females during the mating season. In addition, the rattle occurred in association with screeches more often than expected, and the screech almost never occurred without rattles, suggesting that the functions of the two calls are linked. I discuss the evidence that the rattle is a self-advertisement signal, or "signature". On the other hand, squirrels were less likely to</page><page sequence="223">VOLUME 115 865 be aggressive when they rattled and screeched if they also barked than if they did not; and recipients were concomitantly less likely to retreat, but not more likely to show aggression. I suggest that callers emitted barks after rattles and screeches in response to the other squirrel's not leaving after being threatened, rather than to signal a lower probability of aggression. Barks not accompanied by rattles or screeches had no predictable effect on either the caller's or the recipient's subsequent behaviour. I tentatively interpret the call as a signal emitted in motivational conflict situations, to elicit a change in the recipient's behaviour that would help the caller decide what to do next (HINDE, 1981). The growl was a defensive threat call that accompanied close-range aggression by the caller, but that was not followed by the immediate retreat of the opponent. Finally, the buzz was associated with non-aggressive approaches by the caller. I discuss the function of the screech in the light of the theory of animal conflicts, and suggest that it may convey information contingent upon the recipient's response (WILEY, 1983), rather than unconditional information. Behaviour Vol. 115 (1990) pp. 283-314 AN EXPERIMENTAL COMPARISON OF MALE AND FEMALE SPAWNING TERRITORIALITY IN A PACIFIC SALMON CHRIS J. FOOTE Department of Fisheries and Oceans, Biological Sciences Branch, Pacific Biological Station, Nanaimo, B.C., Canada, V9R 5K6 The spawning territoriality of male and female non-anadromous sockeye salmon, Oncorhynchus nerka, was examined experimentally by comparing the resources sought after, the behaviours used in intrasexual competition, and the correlates of success in intrasexual competition for each sex. Females expressed territorial behaviour both in the presence and absence of males, defending specific, repeatedly selected, spawning sites. In contrast, males exhibited clear territorial behaviour only in the presence of females, defending access to specific females and positions over time. Size was a factor in determining which females established territories within preferred areas, but this advantage was largely negated by prior residency. Size was a major factor in determining which males gained closest access to individual females, with smaller males adopting subordinate, sneak, positions. Prior residence was also a significant factor in determining the outcome of contests for access to females, with the weight of this factor dependent on the relative sizes of competing males. The behavioural differences between sexes appear to arise from differences both in the resources defended and the relative costs of potential losses for each sex. Behaviour Vol. 115 (1990) pp. 315-326 THE EFFECT OF NATURAL CHEMICAL STIMULI ON THE PREFERENTIAL BEHAVIOUR OF OREOCHROMIS MOSSAMBICUS (PISCES: CICHLIDAE) FRY TO MATERNAL MODELS HOWARD I. RUSSOCK Department of Biological and Environmental Sciences, Western Connecticut State University, Danbury, Connecticut 06810, U.S.A. The effect of natural chemical stimuli on the preferential behaviour of Oreochromis mossambicus fry to maternal models was investigated. Previous research (RUSSOCK, 1986) had indicated that when the fry were exposed to a natural maternal model and later given a choice between two maternal models in a simultaneous choice test, no consistent preferential behaviour was exhibited. The present study investigated whether natural chemical stimuli could trigger the expression of preferential behaviour in this situation. In Experiment I groups of fry were exposed to a maternal model and tested for preferential behav- iour between two maternal models in water previously occupied by 1) their mother, 2) another female 0. mossambicus spawning at the same time as their mother, 3) a non-parental female conspecific, 4) a male conspecific or 5) control water. The groups of fry exposed to the maternal models in water previously occupied by their own mother or by an another spawning female did, in fact, exhibit later consistent pref- erential behaviour for the higher contrast model. Groups of fry exposed to non-parental female water, male water or control water did not exhibit later preferential behaviour. In Experiment II groups of fry were not exposed to a visual model before testing, but were 1) exposed to and tested in their mother's water, 2) exposed to control water and tested in their mother's water, or 3) exposed to their mother's water and tested in control water. Only the group of fry exposed and later tested in their mother's water exhibited consistent preferential behaviour toward the 'high contrast' maternal model. It was concluded that the mother's chemical stimuli act to sensitize or potentiate later</page><page sequence="224">866 VOLUME 115 preferential behaviour and also serve as a necessary contextual cue at the time of testing. This phenomenon does not fit neatly into known paradigms of social bond formation such as imprinting, priming or functional validation. However, it does appear to be adaptive in the context of the natural behaviour of the fry. Behaviour Vol. 115 (1990) pp. 327-347 MATRILINEAL SIGNATURES IN THE RECRUITMENT SCREAMS OF PIGTAIL MACAQUES, MACACA NEMESTRINA HAROLD GOUZOULES and SARAH GOUZOULES Department of Psychology &amp; Yerkes Primate Research Center, Emory University and Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center, Emory University, Atlanta, GA. 30332, U.S.A. In macaques and baboons, scream vocalizations play a major role in the recruitment of allies against ago- nistic opponents. Pigtail macaques make use of 4 acoustically distinct scream types, with each associated with a particular agonistic context (defined in terms of the opponent's relative dominance rank and the in- tensity of the aggression). Information about caller identity must also be encoded in recruitment screams if spatially distant allies are to make decisions about intervention. In this study, the agonistic screams of pigtail macaques were analyzed for evidence of vocal signatures that may serve to identify matrilineal kin groups. Maternal genealogical relationships were known for all individuals in the 56 member study group. Direct discriminant analysis was used to classify calls of individuals on the basis of their acoustic structure to one of 3 groups defined by matrilineal relatedness (two homogeneous groups, or matrilines, and one heterogeneous control group). Two scream types associated with higher-ranking opponents were analyzed separately: contact aggression screams and noncontact screams. A highly significant proportion of calls was classified to the correct matrilineal group for both scream classes. The acoustic basis for matrilineal vocal signatures in these calls apparently exists. Efficient vocal communication may require monkeys to classify group members at different levels, depending upon the degree of specificity needed. Behaviour Vol. 115 (1990) pp. 348-370 LEAF SIZE RECOGNITION AND EVALUATION BY SOME ATTELABID WEEVILS (3) DEPORAUS SP. KAZUHIKO SAKURAI Department of Zoology, Faculty of Science, Kyoto University Kitashirakawa-oiwake, Sakyo, Kyoto, 606 Japan Recognition of leaves by females of the leaf-rolling weevil Deporaus sp. was studied. Female weevils perform a sequence of walking along the main vein via the leaf apex (called measuring behaviour) prior to cutting. Observations of the course of walking on an asymmetric model leaf suggest that the main vein is recognized with reference to the protrusion of the leaf apex etc. A quantitative analysis of the location of cutting points indicates the following. The female weevil measures a certain length by walking along the main vein; in this way she evaluates leaf size and decides where to start cutting. An experiment utilizing a sliding leaf model revealed that it is the activity of walking itself, and not vision, that has a mensurative function. Females relate the number of eggs to be laid to the size of the apical part of the leaf, by a criterion other than leaf length (e.g. width or area). A scheme for the cutting point decision is proposed. A different set of mechanisms for measuring is used in small leaves and large leaves. The mechanism for small leaves may involve a memory of distance. The framework of leaf size recognition and the evolution of measuring behaviour are discussed, using a comparison of three species, Chonostropheus chujoi, Apoderus balteatus and Deporaus sp.

THIRGOOD Department of Biology, The University, Southampton, England Male fallow deer Dama dama, in a free-ranging population in the New Forest, southern England, either defend territories on a lek, defend single territories or are non-territorial. Mating success is highest on the lek, but unsuccessful lek males get fewer matings than some single territory males off the lek. The mating success of non-territorial behaviour, which is adopted by most males at some time during the rut, is uncertain. Non-lek matings in this population are higher than those reported in other lekking ungulate populations. Male fallow deer are not specialists, individuals commonly change strategies as mating opportunities dictate. Behaviour Vol. 116 (1991) pp. 11-41 PARENTAL CARE, SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOUR IN TWO LINES OF WILD HOUSE MICE MICHAEL MENDL and ELIZABETH S. PAUL Zoological Laboratory and Department of Animal Physiology, University of Groningen, Kerklaan 30, 9751 NN Haren, The Netherlands Distinct behavioural strategies for dealing with environmental and social challenge are known to exist in the adults of a variety of mammalian species, but little is known about the development bases of these strategies. In an attempt to start to fill this gap in knowledge, the present study set out to describe and compare the development of males from two lines of wild house mice which are known to differ in their aggressive behaviour and response to challenging situations. Adult males from one line (Short Attack Latency = SAL line) are more aggressive, show less sensitivity to changes in their environment and behave in a more internally controlled, routine-like way, than do males from the other line (outbred = Control line). The parental care and development of eight litters of four male pups from each line was observed. Paternal care did not differ between the two lines, but SAL pups received higher levels of nursing and general maternal care than did Control pups, and they appeared to be weaned later. Despite these differences, SAL pups grew more slowly than Control pups, suggesting that their high levels of sucking behaviour were a reflection of high milk demand, perhaps due to a low milk supply, rather than high milk intake. SAL pups were also delayed in a number of measures of early behavioural development relative to Control pups. The apparent early retardation in certain measures of SAL pup behavioural development disappeared at the end of the parental care period. From day 32 onwards, SAL pups began to show higher levels of aggression towards each other than did Control pups, and also showed a reduced reactivity to tests involving changes to the home cage environment; a characteristic of adult SAL males. As expected, SAL males development into faster attackers than Control males and, in SAL litters, intra- litter variation in attack speed was strongly influenced by preceding experience of sibling aggression. The fastest attackers in each litter were more successful in fights occurring in their litter than their slowest attacking siblings. No such relationship was observed in the Control litters where levels of inter-sibling aggression were low. The results point to the potential significance of maternal care behaviour and pup fighting behaviour in the development of the fast-attacking phenotype. One hypothesis is that inadequate nutrition of young SAL pups, mediated through the mother, promotes increased competition for access to the mother's nipples and predisposes the pups to develop into more active/competitive individuals. Subsequent sibling-sibling aggression appears to influence intra-litter variation in adult attack latency.</page><page sequence="226">868 VOLUME 116 Behaviour Vol. 116 (1991) pp.42-63 PREDICTING INFANT ENTERPRISE FROM EARLY RELATIONSHIPS IN RHESUS MACAQUES M.J.A. SIMPSON and S.B. DATTA MRC Unit on the Development and Integration of Behaviour, Cambridge University, Madingley, Cambridge CB3 8AA, England The enterprise of rhesus monkey infants was assessed at 3-6 weeks, in terms of the maximum distances to which they moved away from their mothers, and at 37-44 weeks, in terms of the number of raisins taken in a series of tests in test compartments accessible to the infants but not to their mothers. Between weeks 6 and 37, enterprise in infants changed from low to high, remained low, decreased from high to low, or remained high, and our data let us test hypotheses about the effects of early maternal restriction, early social experience, and exposure to risk on these changes. We were able to refute the view that high levels of early maternal restriction were associated with high levels of late enterprise, for infants changed from low to high levels of enterprise in spite of having been restricted at low rates, and in other cases high levels of enterprise were maintained in spite of low levels of maternal restriction. Levels of early enterprise were unrelated to early levels of social involvement with companions other than mother, and changes in enterprise were not associated with social involvement. This study confirmed that experience of risk can enhance enterprise, for infants showing increases in enterprise were more at risk because their mothers were not top-ranking, or because they had highly aggressive mothers, or because they were in a group in which there was an aggressive adult male. In contrast, the enterprise of infants with top-ranking mothers which were not aggressive decreased. The value of the classification approach used in this study was discussed. When a high proportion of the subjects produces variable data, large numbers are needed to provide cases about whose scores we are confident. Given enough cases, however, hypothesis testing can become more specific than is possible with simple correlational approaches.

LAMPE Department of Zoology, University of Trondheim, N-7055 Dragvoll, Norway HANS CHR. PEDERSEN Norwegian Institute of Nature Research, Tungasletta 2, N-7004 Trondheim, Norway Responses of 33 potential host species towards a non-mimetic, dummy, cuckoo egg placed in their nest were tested (N = 372). For 22 of these species, their behavioural responses towards a dummy cuckoo placed near their nest were also tested (N = 193). The species were grouped in A) most common hosts: species which at the moment are losing out in the coevolutionary arms race with the cuckoo and which today represent favorite hosts; B) frequently-used hosts: species which at the moment are assumed to be true cuckoo hosts, but which are not so commonly used as those in group A; C) rarely-used hosts: species which would appear to be suitable hosts, but which despite of this, are rarely used. These species are assumed to be ahead of the cuckoo in the coevolutionary arms race; D) unsuitable hosts: species with a breeding biology which either prevents, or counteracts, cuckoo parasitism. They are therefore assumed never to have been engaged in a coevolutionary arms race with the cuckoo. In the most common hosts the median acceptance rate of the non-mimetic egg was 86%, in the frequently- used hosts 33%, in the rarely-used hosts 10% and in the unsuitable hosts 100%. In the most common hosts the median rate of aggression shown towards the cuckoo dummy was 50%, but the most numerous species in this group, the meadow pipit, showed aggressive behaviour in 60% of the cases. The median aggression rate both in the frequently-used hosts and the rare hosts was 100% and in the unsuitable hosts 0%. The bluethroat was the only species which accepted the non-mimetic dummy egg at a higher rate later on during the incubation period than during earlier stages. A positive correlation was found between the power of egg discrimination and the rate of aggression shown towards the dummy cuckoo. Such aggression was stronger when both parents were present at the nest than when only one parent was present.</page><page sequence="227">VOLUME 116 869 The results of this study lend support to the hypothesis that the differences in the degree of responses by the host species towards parasitism by the cuckoo reflect different stages in a continuous coevolutionary arms race with cuckoos. Behaviour Vol. 116 (1991) pp.90-108 LITTER COMPOSITION AFFECTS PARENTAL CARE, OFFSPRING GROWTH AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOUR IN WILD HOUSE MICE MICHAEL MENDL and ELIZABETH S. PAUL Zoological Laboratory and Department of Animal Physiology, University of Groningen, Kerklaan 30, 9751 NN Haren, The Netherlands Male mice pups reared with female sibings only are known to develop into more aggressive adults than males reared with males only. The purpose of this study was to examine whether differences in experience of sibling competition and/or parental behaviour might underlie these differences in adult behaviour. The parental care and development of eight litters containing four male pups (MM litters) and eight litters containing one male and three females (MF litters) was compared. As expected, MF males developed into faster attackers than MM males. A variety of measures of sibling competitive and aggressive behaviour, both in the home cage and during tests of competition for food, failed to provide any evidence that experience of success in competitive encounters played a prominent role in the development of individual differences in subsequent aggressiveness. On the other hand, clear differences in parental behaviour and offspring growth were detected as a result of the experimental manipulation. Mothers of MF litters provided more maternal care and appeared to wean their offspring later than mothers of MM litters. Despite this, MF pups grew more slowly than MM pups, suggesting that their high levels of sucking behaviour reflected high milk demand, perhaps due to a low milk supply, rather than high milk intake. One interpretation is that mothers of litters with a female-biassed sex ratio (MF mothers) were in poorer condition than those with a male-biased sex ratio (MM mothers), and consequently provided less adequate nutrition for their pups. Undernutrition during early life is known to result in the development of more aggressive individuals, perhaps by increasing competition for nipples and thereby promoting a more active/competitive mode of behaviour in later life. Behaviour Vol. 116 (1991) pp. 109-126 INCREASED VOCAL DISCRIMINATION BY LEARNING IN SYMPATRY IN TWO SPECIES OF CHAFFINCHES ALEJANDRO LYNCH and ALLAN J. BAKER Department of Zoology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5S lAI Maps of the territories of the two species of chaffinches in an area of sympatry on Tenerife (Fringilla coelebs and E teydea) show that they are not interspecifically territorial. Playback experiments of het- erospecific song show that both species tend to respond in areas of allopatry, but only rarely in sympatry. There is no clear differences in song structure in either species between areas of sympatry and allopatry. Although a comparison of common chaffinch song among 14 samples in the Atlantic region shows sig- nificant amounts of differentiation among regions, there is no clear evidence of character displacement. The divergence of blue chaffinch song can best be explained by the "withdrawal of learning" hypothe- sis, whereby naive birds colonized the Canaries before learning their songs from adult tutors, and thus started a new song tradition. The divergence of common chaffinch song in the Atlantic islands seems to have originated independently of the presence of blue chaffinches there. Both species of chaffinches show increased vocal discrimination in areas of local sympatry, pointing to the role of learning in asso- ciating species-specific songs with the morphological phenotypes of male common and blue chaffinches. Although enhanced vocal discrimination via learning can be used to prevent wastage of time and effort in responding to heterospecific song, it cannot have arisen as a consequence of selection for different specific mate recognition systems in these two species of chaffinches.</page><page sequence="228">870 VOLUME 116 Behaviour Vol. 116 (1991) pp. 127-142 AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF THE BUILDING BEHAVIOUR SEQUENCE OF A SHELL-BREEDING CICHLID-FISH FROM LAKE TANGANYIKA (LAMPROLOGUS OCELLATUS) THORSTEN HAUSSKNECHT and PETER KUENZER II. Zoologisches Institut und Museum, Universitat Gottingen, B.R.D. The cichlid-fish Lamprologus ocellatus (POLL, 1986) digs empty snail into sandy substratum, using them for dwelling and breeding. The sequence of building behaviour was analysed. It can be divided into three phases: (1) in the inspection phase the fish swims into and around the snail shell; (2) while during the digging phase sand is moved away from the shell; (3) in the subsequent oversanding phase, the shell is covered with sand. In the analysis of the building behaviour sequences of eight individuals, each of which performed five trials, interindividual differences were found, but there were no differences among repeated trials of one individual. In the comparison of building procedures on small- and medium-sized shells we noted a dependence of the number of building actions and of the building duration on the size of the snail shell. By offering an artificial sandpit, the digging-phase may be shortened or not take place at all. By enlarging the interior of the pit the oversanding-phase can be lengthened. This led to the conclusion that the behaviour sequence, especially onset and end of the individual phases, is induced and controlled by the change in the external stimulus situation, which is influenced by the performance of the building actions. Information on the progress of building is perceived through the shell-contact-act (cont) in which the fish swims to the snail shell. It alternates with the building activities. The results of the "experiments in an artificial steep-walled pit" (2,2) indicate a visually controlled orientation.

LE BOEUF Department of Biology, University of California, Santa Cruz, CA 95064, U.S.A. SARAH MESNICK Dept. of Ecology &amp; Evolutionary Biology, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721, U.S.A. Adult female mortality of northern elephant seals, Mirounga angustirostris, was monitored daily throughout the breeding season and weekly during the non-breeding season at Anio Nuevo, California, during the period 1968 to 1987. Behavioral observation and necropsy findings were collected and circumstantial evidence was compiled to determine the cause of death. Female deaths on the rookery were rare; only 17 female deaths were recorded over the 20 year period. Cause of death could not be estimated in three cases because of advanced decomposition, one female died from an accident, and two others had no apparent trauma. The majority of deaths (11) were caused by traumatic injuries inflicted by males during mating attempts as the females departed harems for the sea at the end of lactation. Moralities caused by males were distributed across a broad age range. Based on the observed incidence of female mortality in relation to females present on the rookery, the probability of a female being killed by a male during the breeding season is about one in a thousand. Females are expected to evolve adaptations to reduce injurious encounters with males. Females are injured and killed by males during mating attempts in a variety of species. A hypothesis concerning the conditions under which female animals sustain potentially lethal injuries during mating is advanced.</page><page sequence="229">VOLUME 116 871 Behaviour Vol. 116 (1991) pp. 163-179 SONG VARIABILITY AND THE RESPONSE TO CONSPECIFIC SONG AND TO SONG MODELS OF DIFFERENT FREQUENCY CONTENTS IN MALES OF THE BUSHCRICKET REQUENA VERTICALIS (ORTHOPTERA: TETTIGONIIDAE) ANDREA SCHATRAL and WINSTON J. BAILEY Department of Zoology, University of Western Australia, Nedlands 6009, Western Australia Variability in the temporal structure of the song has been investigated for the Australian bushcricket Requena verticalis (Listroscelidinae: Tettigoniinae: Orthoptera). Chirp interval and chirp duration of an individual male vary between two days. Males differ in their readiness to call. Sporadic singers sing consistently only in the presence of another calling conspecific or when acoustically stimulated, while steady singers call readily under acoustic isolation. Sporadic as well as steady singers change their chirp interval in the presence of another calling conspecific. Steady and sporadic singers are able to differentiate between 16 and 28 kHz, the two main frequency components of the song. There is evidence that the effect of the natural song on the temporal pattern of the call may be due to the 28 kHz frequency component. Individual variation in the temporal parameters is within 0.1 s, and the changes caused by acoustic stimu- lation are of similar magnitude. Further studies are necessary to evaluate if males and/or females uses these differences to discriminate between conspecifics.

They were offered a choice of larger and smaller prey of three weight classes (3/10 g; 10/40 g; 40/160 g) either active or inactive (laboratory mice, Mus musculus; laboratory rats, Rattus norvegicus). The frequency of choices of smaller prey increased significantly from the lowest to the highest weight class, and from inactive to active prey. Most frequently, the owls selected prey of 10 g and 40 g. It was shown that both prey size and activity had an equal influence on the decisions. Prediction were made as to which particular prey size a barn owl was going to choose. With increasing prey weight, the frequency of interrupted prey catching acts and conflict behaviour (mantling, feather ruffling) towards the prey, increased. The upper weight for acceptable active rats was about 80 g. One male, which had to supply his female and nestlings with food, subdued somewhat larger prey. Although relative profitability (net nutritive value/unit of time), calculated from the duration of handling prey, decreased with increasing prey weight, the barn owls chose the larger prey under certain conditions. I discuss a strategy which compromises time and energy costs with the search and subduction of the item.

HENRY KERMOTT Department of Biology, St. Olaf College, Northfield, Minnesota, 55057, USA, and The Helen Brinton Bird, Game and Fish Reserve, Box 582, Big Horn, Wyoming, 82833, USA To assess the functions of song in male house wrens (Troglodytes aedon), we examined the pattern of song output during different stages of the breeding cycle and behaviour patterns of focal males and conspecifics that were associated with song. We recorded 2093.5 bouts of song from 11 different males in 12 breeding cycles during 3 years. Most song sung prior to pairing is sung at a high volume and is given spontaneously (i.e. is apparently not produced in response to the behaviour of any conspecific). Production of high volume spontaneous song ceased immediately for at least 7 days when the male paired, but resumed immediately</page><page sequence="230">872 VOLUME 116 upon loss of the mate. Paired males sang high volume spontaneous song after mates began incubating, and almost always sang this song within 10 m of an unoccupied nest site. Several males attracted second mates of these nest sites and immediately ceased their output of high volume spontaneous song. These observations strongly suggest that high volume spontaneous song functions in mate attraction. Male house wrens do not appear to use song on a routine basis to communicate with neighbours or other males. However, they do appear to direct song at other males when territories are threatened. Song is sung at intruders in the territory and at neighbours just establishing a territory of their own. Most song sung after pairing appears to be directed towards mates. We suspect than males use song to inform mates that there is no immediate threat of predation, allowing mates to move quickly to and from nest sites. We discuss the role and benefits of descriptive, correlative studies in assessing song function. Behaviour Vol. 116 (1991) pp.210-238 MALE SONG AS A CUE FOR MATE CHOICE IN THE EUROPEAN STARLING MARCEL EENS, RIANNE PINXTEN and RUDOLF FRANS VERHEYEN Department of Biology, University of Antwerp, U.I.A., Universiteitsplein 1, B-2610 Wilrijk, Belgium This study had two aims. First, we looked at individual differences in song characteristics between males of the European starling, and we related song behaviour to factors such as male age, pairing date, polygyny and male breeding success. Second, we experimentally tested whether song has an effect on female mating decisions. 1. During the breeding season, male starlings sing a very long and complex song consisting of a rapid succession of larger number of different song types. We observed marked differences between males in average song bout length (a song bout was defined as a period of at least five seconds of song containing no pauses larger than 1.5 seconds) and in song repertoire size. Average song bout lengths ranged from 16 to 35 seconds. The individual repertoire size ranged from 23 to 67 song types. Repertoire size and average song bout length were positively correlated. 2. Both in the field and in captivity, yearling males sang shorter average song bout lengths and had smaller repertoire sizes than older males. 3. Males singing longer average song bouts and having larger repertoire sizes attracted females for pairing before their rivals with shorter average song bouts and smaller repertoire sizes. 4. Repertoire size and average song bout length were positively correlated with the number of females attracted and with male breeding success. The correlation between average song bout length and male breeding success remained when yearling males were excluded for the analysis. 5. Choice-experiments carried out in large outdour aviaries indicated that females mated significantly more often with males having larger repertoire sizes and singing longer average song bouts. 6. The overall results indicate that male song characteristics influence female mating decisions in the starling. It is concluded that the complex male song in the European starling has probably evolved as a result of intersexual selection by female choice. Finally, the possible role of song characteristics on female mate choice in the context of extra-pair copulations in songbirds is discussed. Behaviour Vol. 1 16 (1991) pp. 239-251 LITTER GENDER COMPOSITION, FOOD AVAILABILITY, AND MATERNAL DEFENCE OF THE YOUNG IN HOUSE MICE (MUS DOMESTICUS) DARIO MAESTRIPIERI Dipartimento di Genetica e Biologia Molecolare, Universita di Roma La Sapienza, Roma, and Insituto di Psicobiologia e Psicofarmacologia del C.N.R., Roma, Italia Litter gender composition (LGC) of 33 litters of outbred Swiss albino mice was manipulated at birth to obtain 100%-male litters (MM), 50%-male litters (MF) and 100%-female litters (FF). Litter size was 10 in all cases. Litter defence by their respective dams (5-min exposure to an unfamiliar adult male) was scored on postpartum day 7. The influence of litter gender composition on the female's litter defence was tested, with identical procedure, under conditions of restricted feeding. In this case, dams were fed from postpartum days 1-7 with 80% of their normal daily requirement. Under both ad lib. and restricted feeding body weight of mothers and their litters was assessed daily. Under ad lib. feeding, dams rearing MM litters showed higher scores of Total Attacking Time than both MF and FF dams and higher frequency of Attacks and Tail Rattling episodes than MF dams. Food-restricted females showed a sharp decline in body weight and their litters a slower gain in weight than control animals. LGC did not affect mother and</page><page sequence="231">VOLUME 116 873 litter weight changes in both conditions but MM females tended to cannibalize more pups on days 6-7 than MF and FF females. Food-restricted MM and MF dams showed, respectively, lower Total Attacking Time and higher number of Attacks and Tail Rattling episodes than their own Control groups. These results show that, under ad lib. feeding, LGC affects significantly female mouse litter defence. Some possible underlying mechanisms are discussed. These results support only partly the TRIVERS-WILLARD'S hypothesis (1973) about sex-biased investment in the offspring since, even though mouse dams under ad lib. feeding defended more vigorously all-male litters, as predicted by the model, among food-restricted animals no clear shift toward a prevalent defence of female-skewed litters appeared.

KARPLUS Agricultural Research Organization, Fish and Aquaculture Research Unit, P.O. Box 6, Bet-Dagan 50250, Israel M. GOREN Department of Zoology, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel The agonistic behaviour of the freshwater prawn, Macrobrachium rosenbergii, was studied in the labora- tory. One hour long contests were conducted between prawns matched to size in the of the three sexually mature male morphotypes of this species; Small Males, Orange Clawed males and Blue Clawed males. An agonistic ethogram was established, consisting of 18 different acts. These acts were classified into indicators of dominance or subordinance following the application of cluster analysis. Prawns contests consisted usually of 3 phases: pre-escalated fighting phase, escalated fighting phase and post-escalated fighting phase. Contest phases differed both in the frequency of several acts and in the distribution of acts between the eventual winner and loser. In addition, the relative orientation and elevation of the op- ponents changed across phases. The inter and intra-individual sequences of acts of the winner and loser during the escalated fight were studied. Despite the similarity found in the behaviour if the two oppo- nents during the escalated fighting, the eventual winner could be predicted by the relative number and duration of nips or by the relative number of times in which Complete and Incomplete-Lifting (two ma- jor displays of flight) were performed simultaneously with the snapping of the claws. Differences found among morphotypes pointed out a tendency of shifting from interactions with physical contacts towards ritualized interactions without physical contact. This was correlated with the morphotypic developmental pathway and the con-comitant increase of claw size. Behaviour Vol. 116 (1991) pp.278-291 HOW LONG WILL NEWTS WAIT? AN EXPERIMENT TO TEST AN ASSUMPTION OF A CAUSAL MODEL OF THE COURTSHIP OF THE MALE SMOOTH NEWT, TRITURUS V VULGARIS T.R. HALLIDAY and A.I. HOUSTON Brain and Behaviour Research Group, Department of Biology, The Open University, Milton Keynes, MK7 6AA, U.K. and Department of Zoology, South Parks Road, Oxford OXI 3PS, U.K. The NEWTSEX model simulates the behavioural transition between two parts of newt courtship, Retreat Display and Creep, and models the interaction between four causal factors: the behaviour of the female, the male's spermatophore supply, his need for oxygen, and feedback from the male's own behaviour. The model predicts that, if feedback from the female is witheld at a critical point (Tail-touch), the male will revert from Creep to Retreat Display after an interval, the duration of which is proportional to his spermatophore supply. The results of an experiment in which the female's behaviour was controlled support this prediction, but a high level of variance in the results suggests that respiratory constraints on male courtship behaviour require further investigation.</page><page sequence="232">874 VOLUME 116 Behaviour Vol. 116 (1991) pp. 292-320 SOCIAL REGULATION OF FORAGING ACTIVITIES IN POLISTES DOMINULUS CHRIST: A SYSTEMIC APPROACH TO BEHAVIOURAL ORGANIZATION GUY THERAULAZ, JACQUES GERVET and SOPHIE SEMENOFF TIAN-CHANSKI CNRS-UPR 38, 31 chemin Joseph-Aiguier, 13402 Marseille cedex 09, France We studied the processes involved in the reorganization of individual behavioural profiles when the foragers were repeatedly removed on a weekly basis. Neither the age nor the hierarchical rank of the individual directly determined the development of its behavioural profile towards that of a forager profile after removal of the former foragers. However, the closeness of the relationship with the brood seems to have been decisive in the adopting of a new task by the individual. We suggest a model for the functioning of the Polistes society and its organizational genesis which involves two levels of regulation acting simultaneously. The dominance hierarchy results in a primary differentiation of behavioural states among the various members of the society. Each individual reacts preferentially according to its own behavioural state to specific categories of environmental simulations. The type of action which it exerts on the environment both determines its momentary specialization in a specific task and modifies the stimulating situation, which then has lesser effects on the other individuals in the colony. These two processes act in parallel on all the individuals and contribute to maintaining a society with a stable, self- regulated organization. Task organization in the group can therefore be said to be a distributed function which does not require the presence of an individual central organizer.</page><page sequence="233">VOLUME 117 875 Behaviour Vol. 117 (1991) pp. 1-19 PLAYBACK STUDIES OF AFFILIATIVE VOCALIZING IN CAPTIVE SQUIRREL MONKEYS: FAMILIARITY AS A CUE TO RESPONSE MAXEEN BIBEN and DAVID SYMMES Laboratory of Comparative Ethology, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892, U.S.A. 1. A captive social group of squirrel monkeys in an outdoor habitat was presented with recorded chuck calls obtained from conspecific neighbors, neighbors of another Saimiri species, conspecific strangers, and members of the target group itself. 2. Responses to playback of chucks from their own group members were indistinguishable (in frequency, type, and latency) from those made to spontaneously emitted chucks. 3. The most familiar chucks (own group playbacks) received affiliative (chuck) responses as frequently as did spontaneously emitted chucks. Chuck playbacks from neighbors (conspecific or not) and strangers got significantly fewer chuck responses. 4. Chuck playbacks from conspecific neighbors received responses indicating mild interest, those from neighbors of another species received agonistic vocal responses, and those from conspecific strangers received both mild interest and agonism. 5. Own group chucks with multiple repeating element elicited a higher response rate than single element chucks. This effect did not obtain for playbacks from animals outside the target group. 6. Results suggest that playback techniques can be successful with close range affiliative vocalizations like the chuck and that familiarity, species identity, and acoustic structure are all important variables. Behaviour Vol. 1 17 (1991) pp. 20-28 REPRODUCTION AND PARENTAL CARE IN THE SCORPION, EUSCORPIUS FLAVICAUDIS T.G. BENTON Department of Zoology, University of Cambridge, Downing St., Cambridge, CB2 3EJ, England Scorpions exhibit parental care, whereby the female carries her 1st instar young upon her back for the duration of the instar. The one species of scorpion to be found in England, Euscorpius flavicaudis, was used to investigate the functional advantage of parental care. Laboratory conditions, modelled on the natural habitat of this scorpion, showed that the presence, or absence, of the female had no effect on juvenile survival when conspecific scorpions were kept from the experimental scorpions. However, when other scorpions had access to the experimental scorpions, the presence of the female prevented predation; in her absence brood mortality averaged 99%. This is hypothesised to be the major selective advantage to parental care. Other advantages may occur (e.g. trophic exchange, female moderating microclimate, some form of "group effect"-increased survival of larger groups of juveniles) but these are secondary in relation to the avoidance of predation. Behaviour Vol. 117 (1991) pp. 29-52 THE SINGING BEHAVIOUR OF YELLOW WARBLERS DAVID A. SPECTOR Department of Zoology, Morrill Science Center, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, Massachusetts 01003, U.S.A. Yellow warblers (Dendroica petechia aestiva), like other wood-warblers (Parulinae), use different songs in different circumstances. Analysis of recordings of 28,697 songs from 17 wild male yellow warblers from 1983 to 1988 at Amherst, Massachusetts, U.S.A., showed a consistent pattern of singing behaviour. I found that each male yellow warbler has a repertoire of songs divided into a single Type I son and a group of Type II songs. The patterns of song use are standardized, but the song types used as Type I and Type II songs are not; some males' Type I songs were similar to others males' Type II songs. Type I songs are sung relatively slowly in long runs of the song during daylight, are used near females, and, as demonstrated by mate removal experiments, are used more by unmated than by mated males. Type II songs are used in a dawn song bout, are sung relatively rapidly with much switching among song types, and are used in interactions with other males. Type I songs seem to have higher frequencies of modal</page><page sequence="234">876 VOLUME 117 intensity, especially in the initial phrase, and to have a greater increase in amplitude at the start of the song than do Type II songs. There may be some minor variation in the ways individual males use Type I and Type II songs, but the overall pattern of use is similar among males. Types I and II songs seem to be male-female and male-male signals, respectively. Thus, female response to song may have selected for a relatively simple signal with a high frequency of modal intensity, while male response to song may have selected for a relatively complex, low frequency signal. Behaviour Vol. 117 (1991) pp. 53-81 SPECIES-SPECIFICITY AND MIMICRY IN BIRD SONG: ARE THEY PARADOXES? A REEVALUATION OF SONG MIMICRY IN THE EUROPEAN STARLING M. HAUSBERGER Laboratoire d'Ethologie, URA, CNRS 373, Universite de Rennes I, Avenue du General Leclerc, 35042 Rennes Cedex, France P.F. JENKINS Laboratoire d'Ethologie, URA, CNRS 373, Universite de Rennes I, Avenue du General Leclerc, 35042 Rennes Cedex, France, and Department of Zoology, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand J. KEENE Department of Zoology, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand The possible structural relation between species-specificity and interspecific mimicry has been investigated in European starling's song. Mimicries have been recorded in several populations in Europe and in New Zealand. Previous studies of starling's song have shown that two basic categories, one composed of simple and loud songs (whistles), the other of long quiet and complex songs (warbles) can be recognized in the repertoires of all male starlings. Mimicries can be found in both contexts: in a loud and isolated way or included in warbling sequences. In Europe, about a third of the whistles are mimicries in an individual repertoire. Within a colony, the types of mimicries are individual-specific, but the same loud mimicries can be heard in different colonies. The loud mimicries are characterized by a high homogeneity amongst populations: half of those recorded in different countries in Europe correspond to the same 4 models (blackbird, little owl, buzzard, oriole). This does not reflect the abundance of the species in the environment and suggests a very strong selectivity. Results are totally different for the warbling in which most mimicries are unique to one starling and mainly reflect the sound environment. Little overlap is found between warbled and loud mimicries. Both in Europe and New Zealand, loud mimicries tend to have a simple whistled structure whereas the warbled ones most often include trills and several varied notes. Structural relations could be found between the species-specific whistled themes and the types of loud mimicries. Similarly quiet mimicries are included in the characteristic organization of warbling. Therefore it is suggested that the starling possesses two types of "templates" in its species-specific song which are reflected in its mimicries with quite different degrees of selectivity. These two categories of mimicries may have evolved for functional reasons that are linked to the corresponding functions of the species-specific songs themselves. Behaviour Vol. 117 (1991) pp. 82-105 REPRODUCTIVE BENEFITS AND THE DURATION OF PATERNAL CARE IN A BIPARENTAL BURYING BEETLE, NECROPHORUS ORBICOLLIS STEPHEN T. TRUMBO Department of Biology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, N.C. 27599, U.S.A. A monogamous pair of burying beetles (Necrophorus spp.) prepares a vertebrate carcass as a food source for their young and then protects the carcass and young from aggressive congeners. It was estimated that N. orbicollis males received four times the reproductive benefit on large (27-33 g) as opposed to small carcasses (10-18 g) in the field. Large carcasses were more likely to be taken over by free-flying intruders than small carcasses and the presence of a male parent reduced the probability of such takeovers. A male also decreased the time that a large carcass was vulnerable to a takeover. The presence of a male did not affect the number of larvae produced in field or laboratory experiments or the size of larvae reared in the laboratory. Males provided a longer duration of care when on a large carcass, when larval development</page><page sequence="235">VOLUME 117 877 was slow, or when the female was removed experimentally. The number of larvae, the number of days spent on the carcass, the mass of the carcass remaining at the end of the trial, female size, male size, burial depth and prior reproduction were not found to have independent effects on the probability of finding the male on the carcass. In addition, males that were allowed to provide care prior to being placed in the field did not show a subsequent decline in reproductive success as compared to males that did not provide prior care. Behaviour Vol. 117 (1991) pp. 106-116 DIFFERENCE IN THE RESPONSES OF CAPTIVE FEMALE CANARIES TO VARIATION IN CONSPECIFIC AND HETEROSPECIFIC SONGS MICHEL L. KREUTZER and ERIC M. VALLET Laboratoire d'Ethologie et Sociobiologie, C.N.R.S. U.R.A. 667, Universite Paris Nord, 93430 Villetaneuse, France The song of male canaries (Serinus canaria) differs greatly from one strain to another (wild and dif- ferent domesticated breeds) depending on breeders' attempt during selective breedings. Female canaries (common canary strain) previously treated with estradiol were tested for their sexual copulation solicita- tion display in response to heterospecific and conspecific song stimuli. Heterospecific songs, winter wren (Troglodytes troglodytes) and greenfinch (Chloris chloris), elicited significantly weak reactions from fe- males, but most of the females did react to these heterospecific songs. Two conspecific songs, the females' own strain song and a Border song, elicited significantly strong reactions compared to Harzer roller. A wild canary song has an intermediate song potential between Border and Harzer roller. As a whole these results support the ideas that artificial selection may have relaxed the strength of reproductive isolation and sexual selection. Behaviour Vol. 117 (1991) pp. 117-143 ANALYSE COMPARATIVE DE LA STRUCTURE DU COMPORTEMENT SEXUEL CHEZ DEUX ESPECES DE GECKOS NOCTURNES: EUBLEPHARIS MACULARIUS ET PAROEDURA PICTUS (SAURIA, GEKKONIDAE) C. BRILLET C.N.R.S., Equipe d'Ethologie, UPR 38, 31, chemin Joseph Aiguier, 13402 Marseille, France The sexual behaviour of two species of ground-dwelling, nocturnal geckos (Eublepharis macularius, Eublepharinae, Western Asia, and Paroedura pictus, Gekkoninae, Madagascar) was compared, and the structure of this behaviour as well as a set of quantitative and qualitative differences were analysed. The quantitative study showed that the duration of sexual interactions varies significantly between these two species: it is much longer in P pictus. In addition to this overall difference these exists an interspecific difference in the duration of the display components. P pictus performs as lengthy copulation with very short preliminaries, which are reduced to a minimum of acts; the reverse occurs in E. macularius: here the precopulatory activity consists of a long exchange of tactile and olfactive stimulations, whereas the copulation is brief. Each species performs a number of acts which are species-specific. One striking feature of P. pictus' behaviour is the fact that it always makes a pre-copulatory pause, the duration of which shows little variability. During copulation, the male holds the female with its front legs only. It exhibits strong, separate spasms, and, occasionally, lengthy series of pelvic thrusts. The female performs typical head movements. When the Eublepharis male is brought face to face with a female, or even if it perceives only a female's chemical signal, it performs two specific acts: marking the substratum and a very fast, stereotyped vibration of the distal part of the tail. The latter is never observed in any other context. While copulating, the Eublepharis male holds the female by gripping a very small fold of skin near the auricular opening between its jaws. Intra-specific variability of sexual behaviour exists within each of the two species studied. In E. macularius this concerns mainly the preliminaries, while in P. pictus it concerns the length of copulation. The present data on the sexual behaviour of these two species are compared with those of the few other Gekkonidae on which behavioural studies have focused. It is also suggested that some aspects of P pictus' reproductive activities might make this species, which is smaller in size, less vulnerable to predators.</page><page sequence="236">878 VOLUME 117 Behaviour Vol. 117 (1991) pp. 145-160 MORPHOTYPE RELATED DOMINANCE HIERARCHIES IN MALES OF MACROBRACHIUM ROSENBERGII (CRUSTACEA, PALAEMONIDAE) A. BARKI and I. KARPLUS Agricultural Research Organization, Fish and Aquaculture Research Unit, P.O. Box 6, Bet-Dagan 50250, Israel M. GOREN Department of Zoology, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel Agonistic interactions in groups of Macrobrachium rosenbergii males were investigated in the laboratory. Each of the ten replicate groups consisted of the three distinct male morphotypes of this species: two Blue Clawed (BC) males and two Orange Clawed (OC) males matched to size, and two, much smaller, Small Males (SM). Male prawns formed a linear dominance hierarchy in which BC males were dominant over OC males which, in turn, were dominant over DSM. Stabilization of the hierarchy over a period of three days was evident from reduction in the number of agonistic interactions and their intensity with time. The three male morphotypes differed in the extent to which they were involved in agonistic interactions and the nature of these interactions. Behaviour Vol. 117 (1991) pp. 161-181 AGGRESSIVE COMMUNICATION BY LARUS GLAUCESCENS PART VII. THE ROLE OF THE INTRUDER ERNEST R. SCHWAB and JOHN F. STOUT Biology Dept., Andrews University, Berrien Springs, Michigan 49104, U.S.A. Aggressive communication between territory defenders and intruders in a glaucous-winged gull (Larus glaucescens) colony was analyzed using 453 aggressive interactions (strings) recorded on video tape. Special attention was given to the role of the intruder in each interaction. Based on these analyses, the display we named Slouch was described both posturally and functionally. Slouch posture was used almost exclusively be intruders. Each string analyzed was placed in one of two categories, defined by intruder behavior. The category called "Upright" was characterized by intruders using only Upright postures. The second category, called "Slouch", was characterized by intruders that used both Upright and Slouch postures. Analyses were performed separately but identically on strings from each category. Conclusions were based on comparisons of results from the two categories. Interactions in both categories were initiated by an intruder entering a territory. Territory owners responded to intruder entry and effected intruder exit in a virtually identical fashion in both categories. This indicated differences between Slouch and Upright categories were derived from differences occurring during the interim between intruder entry and prior to intruder exit. The interim period in Slouch category interactions was temporally more protracted than in Upright category interactions. However, total behavior frequency was approximately equal in both categories. These data indicated pauses were occurring in the intermediate segments of the lengthier Slouch strings. Pauses during the interim corresponded with episodes of intruder Slouch and subsequent defender re- sponses. Intruders used Slouch independent of preceding defender behaviors. Whereas the behaviors of territory defenders tended to be predictably associated with specific behaviors of Upright intruders, re- sponses to intruders using Slouch were characterized by a variety of non-associated behaviors. This lack of predictability was judged to result from tenacious intruder adherence to Slouch regardless of defender response, and resulted in creating the long pauses in Slouch strings. This is a likely indicator of a more threatening intruder. Previous experimental work has shown that Upright intruders approaching a defender are responded to as being more threatening that those remaining stationary or moving away. An analysis of interactions in which both Upright intruders and those using Slouch approached the defender revealed almost identical defender responses. Furthermore, intruders using Slouch approached territory defenders more frequently than did Upright intruders, and responded classically less frequently to defender Mew-Choke display than did Upright intruders. Both characteristics are indicative of a higher level of tenacity (or threat) among intruders using Slouch. Differences observed in the two categories of strings were interpreted as being intruder specific, since these differences were based on the use or lack of use of Slouch display by intruders. Furthermore, the fact that territory defenders responded to initial entry of intruders in both categories in the same fashion</page><page sequence="237">VOLUME 117 879 was used to rule out differences as being defender specific. The observed differences appeared to result from a single factor-the seeming inability of territory owners to rapidly displace intruders using Slouch display. It was concluded the chief differences between Upright and Slouch intruders was the degree of threat conveyed by each display to the territory defender. Intruders using Slouch were more site tenacious, they conveyed a greater level of threat than did Upright intruders, and consequently were able to remain longer in a temtory. Behaviour Vol. 117 (1991) pp. 182-205 MATING SYSTEM AND REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS: A COMPARISON OF TWO AFRICAN FOREST MONKEYS (COLOBUS BADIUS AND CERCOPITHECUS ASCANIUS) THOMAS T. STRUHSAKER Wildlife Conservation International and Department of Wildlife and Range Sciences, University of Florida, U.S.A. THERESA R. POPE Florida State Museum of Natural History, Gainesville, Flo., U.S.A. Reproductive success was compared between two species of rainforest monkeys. The folivorous red colobus lived in patrilineal, multi-male groups, whereas the omnivorous, redtail had matrilineal groups usually with only one adult male, but occasionally experiencing temporary multi-male influxes. Maternal investment by red colobus in offspring was demonstrated in two ways. Offspring survival was positively correlated with interbirth interval even when cases of neonatal mortality were excluded. Among male red colobus surviving to at least 24 months, the interbirth interval following their birth was positively correlated with the age at which they disappeared or became breeders. Female red colobus appear to invest more in sons than daughters. Among the primate species examined, females invested more in their sons and daughters depending upon variables such as intersexual differences in variance in reproductive success, the dispersing sex, and maternal dominance rank as it influenced the offspring's reproductive success. Lifetime reproductive success (LRS) of female red colobus was influenced most by offspring survivorship and less so by birth rate. In contrast, LRS of male red colobus was largely a function of reproductive rate and lifespan, with offspring survivorship playing a much smaller role. Variance in LRS was higher in males than females. This difference was much more pronounced in the one-male groups of redtails than the multi-male groups of red colobus. The coefficient of variation in male reproductive success in these two species was similar to that in other polygynous mammals, except elephant seals. Although offspring mortality and estimated reproductive lifespan were nearly identical for males of the two species, the harem breeding system and highly skewed adult sex ratio lead to greater, more variable LRS in redtail males. Male red colobus within groups produced about 20% more offspring per year than male redtails, but the large proportion of red colobus males with zero breeding success reduced mean LRS to 40% less than redtails. While annual fecundity among adult females of both species was similar, variance in annual fecundity among female redtails was over five times greater than in female red colobus. This, accompanied by a longer reproductive lifespan in red colobus females, lead to a higher LRS in female red colobus and a lower coefficient of variation than in female red-tails. Although females are the primary dispersers in red colobus, they did not have a greater coefficient of variation in LRS than in species where females rarely disperse. This is because female red colobus were readilty accepted into new groups and their intergroup transfer was relatively rapid with little time, if any, spent as a solitary. In both red colobus and redtails adult males contributed, on average, more offspring to the succeeding generation than adult females, as in other polygynous mammals. This is because fewer males survived to adulthood, but once they reached adulthood, their estimated reproductive lifespans were similar to females.

C.N.R.S. 1293, Universite de Nancy I, B.P. 239, F-54506 Vandoeuvre les Nancy Cedex, France Prey capture and ingestion by the orb-weaving spider Zygiella x-notata have been studied in relation to prey type and to prey density (number of prey items presented/time unit).</page><page sequence="238">880 VOLUME 117 Whatever the type or the weight of a prey item (11 mg fly, 11 mg or 15 mg cricket larva), the pattern of prey capture did not vary. Ingestion rate did not vary during a meal when the prey was a fly, but this rate decreased with time when the prey was a cricket larva. This decrease was not due to satiation. When several prey items of the same type were placed simultaneously on a web, the spiders subdued them all, chose one of them (generally the first item) and then returned to its retreat to ingest it. A spider presented 3 crickets larvae at one-hour intervals, interrupted feeding on the first item when the second prey was presented. The second item was subdued more rapidly than the first one had been, but the spider left the second prey in the web and returned to its previous item. The third prey item was treated in the same manner as the second one. Spiders spent less time feeding on the first cricket larva in multi-prey tests, whatever the interval between prey arrivals, than on a cricket larva in single-prey test. On the other hand, no difference was found between the singly-prey test and the multi-prey test when the prey were flies. In addition, whatever the prey type, quantities ingested (fresh weight) did not vary significantly between the single and multi-prey tests. Data presented here suggest that Zygiella x-notata can modify trade-offs obtained during prey item in- gestion and that ingestion curves are good predictions of the quantity ingested in relation of time spent feeding. Behaviour Vol. 117 (1991) pp. 220-242 THE EFFECTS OF LEOPARD PREDATION OF GROUPING PATTERNS IN FOREST CHIMPANZEES CHRISTOPHE BOESCH Department of Ethology and Wildlife Research, University of Zurich, Switzerland, and Centre Suisse de Recherches Scientifiques, Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire During a 5-year period, 29 interactions between chimpanzees and leopards have been observed or inferred in the tropical rainforest of the Tai National Park, Cote d'Ivoire. Chimpanzees chased away leopards in 9 cases, rescued alarm calling chimpanzees in 11 cases (in 4 of these footprints or growls of leopards were noted), 9 times leopards attacked chimpanzees, injuring 6 of them and killing 4. Two of the latters were most certainly eaten by the leopard later. Predation by leopards is estimated to be the first cause of mortality in the Tai chimpanzees and individual chimpanzees may experience a risk of predatory attack of 0.30 per year and a mortality risk of 0.055 per year. Tai chimpanzees adapt specifically their grouping patterns to food availability and to predation: with abundant food and low predation, party size increases and mixed parties are more frequent, whereas with the same food condition but with high predation, party size decreased and all-male party types increase. Comparisons with data on grouping patterns from Gombe and Mahale chimpanzees living in more open habitats support the hypothesis that this species adapts itself to leopard predation which is known to be lower in savanna habitats. The grouping patterns of the bonobo in Lomako forest seem more similar to Tai than to Gombe or Mahale chimpanzees, suggesting an analogous adaptation to high predation pressure. Behaviour Vol. 1 17 (1991) pp. 243-254 SOME PROBLEMS WITH CURRENT PATCH-CHOICE THEORY: A STUDY ON THE MONGOLIAN GERBIL BJORN FORKMAN Department of Zoology, University of Stockholm, Sweden Gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) were allowed to forage during four periods in an environment that contained three bowls; one with sand, the second with 30 sunflower seeds mixed with sand, and the third with just seeds (during period 1) or 250 seeds mixed with sand (during periods 2, 3 and 4). During periods 1 and 2 the animals ate approximately 24 seeds from the 30 bowl. The behavior of working for food while "free food" is present was not influenced by whether or not food really was "free" or if it was just a question of the amount of work required. During all three stable treatments (1, 2, and 4) the animals began by eating for about 15 min from the 30 bowl and only later changed over to the richest bowl. The big difference in behavior occurred in treatment 3 when the location of the bowls was changed. The animals took significantly less seeds from the 30 bowl (11 seeds), and no pattern like that from 1, 2, and 4 could be found. It is probable that the change in behavior between period 2 and 3 was elicited by the change in certainty of food resources. As the world became more uncertain the animals reduced the</page><page sequence="239">VOLUME 117 881 explorative part of their behavior and increased the exploitative part, i.e. they came closer to being short term maximizers. Treatment 4 was equal to treatment 2 and done to control for any learning effects. No such effects were found. Behaviour Vol. 117 (1991) pp. 255-261 THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF VISUAL AND CHEMICAL CUES FOR FORAGING IN NEWBORN BLUE-STRIPED GARTER SNAKES (THAMNOPHIS SIRTALIS SIMILIS) KEVIN L. TEATHER Department of Zoology, Cambridge University, Cambridge, CB2 3EJ England Although vision is known to be important for natricine snakes that specialize in aquatic predation, its relative importance for those species having more general diets is not clear. In this study, I experimentally manipulated exposure of newborn blue-striped garter snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis similis) to a) different combination of visual and chemical cues and b) aquatic prey that differed in their visibility to snakes. Visual cues, in the absence of chemical cues, were insufficient to elicit foraging although were important in successful capture of prey. These results support earlier observations that visual cues are not involved in eliciting attacks but may serve to orient attacks elicited by chemical cues. Behaviour Vol. 1 17 (1991) pp. 262-280 SEXUAL BEHAVIOR OF MALE NORTHERN ELEPHANT SEALS: II. FEMALE RESPONSE TO POTENTIALLY INJURIOUS ENCOUNTERS SARAH L. MESNICK and BURNEY J. LE BOEUF Department of Biology and Institute of Marine Sciences, University of California, Santa Cruz, California 95064, U.S.A. During mating attempts by males, female elephant seals, Mirounga angustirostris, are sometimes injured or killed as they return to sea at the end of lactation. We tested two predictions from the general hypothesis that females behave in a way that reduces the possibility of injury or death from sexual encounters with males: 1) departing females attempt to avoid males, and 2) if males cannot be avoided, departing females exhibit sexually receptive behavior to males, the thereby reduce the threat of injury from aggressive mating attempts. Circumstances surrounding the departure of 336 females from harems on the Anio Nuevo rookery in central California were recorded over the course of nine breeding seasons from 1982-1990. Females did little to avoid encounters with males surrounding harems; they did not leave in greater numbers at night, in groups, or during disturbances on the harem periphery. They did, however, leave harems preferentially at high tide which reduced the distance to the water and shortened transist time. Most departing females did not resist the mating attempts of peripheral males but, rather, they were unusually receptive. Receptive females received fewer blows capable of producing injury than resisting females. We conclude that receptive behavior in this context "buys safe passage". It is an effective means of reducing male aggression and the probability of injury; a male has no need to restrain a receptive female with lows, and should the most dominant male in the area copulate with a departing female, he frequently escorts her to sea and defends her from other males.

Unimanual act of pick up of a number of pieces of fruits and monkey chow, scattered on the floor of the cages, was chosen for recording. Of the 46 adult animals, 20 (43.5%) were left-handed, 15 (32.6%) were ambidextrous and 11 (23.9%) were right-handed. This distribution of hand-use was statistically different from chance. Overall % of left hand-use of each of the 23 infants significantly positively correlated with that of its</page><page sequence="240">882 VOLUME 117 mother, but not with that of its father. Marmoset handedness is a continuous dimension, skewed towards left-handedness, and offspring hand-use preference is strongly influenced by handedness of their mothers. Behaviour Vol. 117 (1991) pp. 287-302 ETUDE EXPERIMENTALE DES MODALITES DE COMMUNICATION DANS LE COMPORTEMENT SEXUEL DE CALLIPHORA VOMITORIA (DIPTERA, CALLIPHORIDAE). 2. ROLE DE LA TETE DU PARTENAIRE SEXUEL TAOUFIQ BENZIANE, BERNARD THON et MIREILLE CAMPAN Centre de Recherche en Biologie du Comportement, CNRS URA n0664, 118 Route de Narbonne, 31062 Toulouse, France This paper analyzes the consequences of modifications of the head of the sexual partner on the initiation and behavioural processing of the courtship of the male Calliphora vomitoria. Experiments were made with male and female specimen without head, with an inverted head, or a head of the other sex. Courtship was quantitatively evaluated with respect to the latency time of the first contact the male made with the female, the duration of courtship and of the main acts performed, the frequency of these acts as well as the sequences in which they occurred, and the number of copulations. The results show that the structure of the male's courtship varies according to anatomical characteristics of the head of the partner. It seems that first, from a short distance, visual features of the head and especially of the inter-ocular space (which anatomically differs between the sexes) direct the male; they are of more importance than the integrated structure of the anterio-posterior axis of the insect. After contact is made the male collects, on the basis of the visual information received, tactile and chemical information, mainly by drumming the head and specifically the interocular space with its prothoracic legs. Courtship was most severely disrupted to females with inverted heads; second to it came that to female decoys with male heads. On the basis of the results obtained the experiments can be arranged on a gliding scale from "perverted" to normal courtship. Several different courtship sequences can be effectuated with the activities available in the repertoire. Lack of signals from a decoy seem to be less of a handicap than false signals. The data suggest that for the organisation of normal courtship a certain coherence has to exist among the sensory stimuli, their order of appearance signalling the female's body. An internal image of the female seems to be compared with the pattern of stimulation received by the male. Behaviour Vol. 117 (1991) pp. 303-319 AUDITORY LEARNING AND FILIAL IMPRINTING IN THE CHICK HENDRIK S. VAN KAMPEN Zoological Laboratory, University of Groningen, P.O. Box 14, 9750 AA Haren, The Netherlands JOHAN J. BOLHUIS Department of Zoology, University of Cambridge, Downing Street, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England The present study investigated auditory learning in chicks (Gallus gallus domesticus) in a filial imprinting situation, using an experimental design employed frequently in laboratory studies of visual imprinting. In Experiment 1, chicks were trained by exposing them to one of two artificial sounds. The presence of a visual stimulus (a rotating red box) during training enhanced subsequent preferential approach to the training sound (Exp. la, lb), while prolonged training in the presence of the box led to a significant preference for the training sound over a novel sound (Exp. lc). In Experiment 2, chicks were trained by exposing them to one of two maternal cluck-vocalizations. There was significant auditory learning in the absence of the red box, but training in the presence of the box resulted in a greater preference for the training call. These results that show that chicks can develop a preference for an auditory stimulus as a result of exposure to it. The presence of a visual stimulus during training enhances auditory learning, possibly through associative learning or through increased arousal or attention.</page><page sequence="241">VOLUME 118 883 Behaviour Vol. 118 (1991) pp. 1-14 TEMPORAL PATTERNS OF BASKING BEHAVIOUR IN A MEDITERRANEAN LACERTID LIZARD JOSE A. DIAZ Depto. de Biologia Animal I (Vertebrados), Fac. de Biologia, Univ. Complutense, 28040 Madrid, Spain 1. I studied the thermoregulatory behaviour of the diurnal basker Psammodromus algirus (Reptilia, Lacertidae) in the mosaic of sunshade patches of a Mediterranean evergreen forest. 48 behavioural sequences associated with measurements of the thermal environment provided data on the percentages of time spent basking by focal animals, the duration of individual basking periods and the frequency of basking. 2. The percentage of time basking decreased linearly from the onset of the activity period until midday. The average duration of basking periods had a pronounced decrease after 0700 h and remained constant throughout the rest of the morning, whereas the basking rates, that were minimal before 0700 h, reached a peak between 0700 and 0800 h followed by a progressive fall that continued until noon. 3. In order to explain these behavioural patterns, I experimentally determined the effects of environmental variables (air and ground temperature and solar angle) on the heating and cooling rates of captive lizards. The resulting regression models were then used to predict the heat exchange rates of the observed free- ranging animals. 4. The moment at which heating rates should equal and then exceed cooling rates, appeared to set off the behavioural shift towards a larger frequency of shorter basking periods. Under these circumstances, the apparently random movement of a shuttling heliotherm with respect to sun and shade might still be of thermoregulatory significance. Behaviour Vol. 118 (1991) pp. 15-25 SIGNATURE VERSUS PERCEPTUAL ADAPTATIONS FOR INDIVIDUAL VOCAL RECOGNITION IN SWALLOWS PATRICIA LOESCHE, PHILIP K. STODDARD, B.J. HIGGINS and MICHAEL D. BEECHER Animal Behavior Program, Department of Psychology, University of Washington, Seattle WA 98195, U.S.A. Field experiments have shown that parents in the colonially-nesting cliff swallow (Hirundo pyrrhonota) discriminate between their offspring and unrelated young whereas parents in the closely-related but non- colonial barn swallow (H. rustica) do not, and that discrimination is based on the chick begging call. In a laboratory experiment, we trained three cliff swallows, two barn swallows and a European starling (Sturnus vulgaris) to discriminate among chick begging calls of the two swallow species. All birds dis- criminated more easily among the calls of different cliff swallows than among the calls of different barn swallows, suggesting that cliff swallow calls are more individually distinctive, and may be adapted for a signature function. Moreover, cliff swallows discriminated among both cliff swallow and barn swallow calls faster than did the other birds, which is consistent with a perceptual adaptation for conspecific calls that incidentally facilitates the discrimination of similarly-structured heterospecific calls. Behaviour Vol. 118 (1991) pp. 26-41 PASSING AS AN INDICATOR OF SOCIAL DOMINANCE AMONG FEMALE WILD AND DOMESTIC NORWAY RATS TERRA ZIPORYN and MARTHA K. McCLINTOCK Department of Psychology, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60637, U.S.A. The most frequent form of social interaction between pairs of wild or domestic rats (Rattus norvegicus) was passing behaviour in the narrow burrows and open field of seminatural environments. This behaviour occurs when a moving rat approaches another, either head-to-head or head-to-tail; the passed animal freezes while the passing rat continues, side touching side. The social dominance manifest by this behaviour correlated significantly with fighting dominance, particularly among female wild and domestic rats. In addition, dominance during displacements for access to food and water correlated with the dominance relationship in passing within pairs of domestic female rats. Although both passing and general activity had the same crepuscular daily rhythm, passing dominance did not correlate with individual differences</page><page sequence="242">884 VOLUME 118 in general activity level. Thus passing indicates social order and is not simply a by-product of general activity. Because passing occurs ten times more frequently than fights, in future studies it may be a more powerful indicator of female dominance and social order. Behaviour Vol. 118 (1991) pp. 42-65 SOCIAL INERTIA AND HORMONAL CONTROL OF AGGRESSION AND DOMINANCE IN WHITE-THROATED SPARROWS MANEE ARCHAWARANON, LORNA DOVE and R. HAVEN WILEY Department of Biology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-3280, U.S.A. To investigate the effects of familiarity with opponents on the activation of aggression and dominance by testosterone (T) in white-throated sparrows Zonotrichia albicollis, we studied birds in groups of five or six in outdoor aviaries and in a free-living population. Experiments were conducted between January and April, when plasma levels of endogenous gonadal hormones were low. Previously published experiments (ARCHAWARANON &amp; WILEY, 1988) showed that when subjects were given subcutaneous implants of T, held individually in cages for one week, and then grouped with unfamiliar opponents, they established dominance over controls with empty implants. In contracts, the present study showed that low-ranking birds given subcutaneous implants of T and returned to their original groups and aviaries did not change in dominance rank nor in aggression scores over a period of two weeks. When these birds were regrouped with unfamiliar opponents in new aviaries, their dominance ranks and aggression scores increased. This rise in dominance rankings and aggression scores did not results from any effects of regrouping in the absence of hormonal treatments. The sexes did not differ in their responses to these treatments. In the field, T implants markedly increased some individuals' frequencies of aggression but had little or no effect on dominance relationships. The absence of behavioral changes in stable groupings after hormonal treatment, called social inertia, indicates that birds recognize the relative dominance of previous opponents, at least when encountered in familiar locations. Results from the field experiment thus suggest that white- throated sparrows can recognize at least 20 opponents. Hormonal state has more influence on dominance relationships of strangers than on those of opponents familiar with each other in familiar locations. Behaviour Vol. 118 (1991) pp.66-88 COMPETITION TO CARRY INFANTS IN CAPTIVE FAMILIES OF COTTON-TOP TAMARINS (SAGUINUS OEDIPUS) ELUNED C. PRICE Department of Psychology, University of Stirling, Stirling, FK9 4LA, Scotland The Callitrichidae (marmosets and tamarins) typically produce twins, and have communal rearing systems in which all group members help care for the infants. It has been hypothesised that helpers benefit in some way from assisting in infant care. If so, then competition to carry infants would be predicted. This was tested in a study of 14 litters of captive cotton-top tamarins (Saguinus oedipus). All occurrences of infant transfers (movements of infants from one caretaker to another) were recorded from birth to 12 weeks. Individuals in larger groups were less likely to reject infants, more likely to actively take infants, more likely to resist attempts by others to take, and more likely to intervene in transfers, suggesting increased competition to carry in large groups. Singletons were rejected less than twin infants, again suggesting the existence of competition amongst caretakers. Mothers rejected infants more frequently than fathers; young tamarins rejected infants more than older tamarins. There was evidence that carrying by juvenile siblings and by adult daughters was limited by other group members. There was evidence that adult sons and sub-adult sons and daughters competed most strongly, and were more likely to attempt to limit carrying by other group members. These results were interpreted in the light of hypotheses suggesting that the benefits to be grained from helping may differ amongst age-sex classes.</page><page sequence="243">VOLUME 118 885 Behaviour Vol. 118 (1991) pp. 89-102 SIDE-DIRECTED BEHAVIOUR AND RECRUITMENT OF SUPPORT IN CAPTIVE CHIMPANZEES CHARLOTTE K. HEMELRIJK, THEO J.M. KLOMBERG, JANNEKE H. NOOITGEDAGT and JAN A.R.A.M. VAN HOOFF Department of Comparative Physiology, University of Utrecht, Padualaan 14, 3508 TB Utrecht, and Burgers' Dierenpark, Arnhem, The Netherlands We studied the relation between support in conflicts and site-directed behaviour (i.e. non-agonistic behav- iour displayed by one of the combatants to an outsider) in two captive colonies of chimpanzees. Side-directed behaviour was not a precondition to acquire help in fights, since most support was obtained without preceding side-directed behaviour. Besides, side-directed behaviour was rarely followed by the receipt of support and there was no indication that it increased the change to receive help. Only between females side-directed behaviour was aimed more often at those from whom support was also received more frequently. This suggests that although females were seldom successful to enlist support from one another, this might still have been the aim of their behaviour. Side-directed behaviour was not performed at random: per conflict it was shown more often by females than males; both sexes performed it especially when receiving a conflict rather than starting it themselves and during conflicts with their own sex; both sexes directed it more often to males than females. Further, more side-directed behaviour was directed to partners the higher the rank of the partner. This means that side-directed behaviour brings a threatened individual in the proximity of a high ranking individual, which may function as a protective zone and thus thwart the aggression of the opponent. Although in periods with an unclear alpha-male position males reciprocated support, there was no evidence that this reciprocation was mediated by side-directed behaviour. In these periods males may benefit directly from attacking common rivals. If this is true, both helping and reciprocation may be unintentional. Behaviour Vol. 118 (1991) pp. 103-114 HERD STRUCTURE, LEADERSHIP, DOMINANCE AND SITE ATTACHMENT OF THE CAMEL, CAMELUS DROMEDARIUS NORBERT SCHULTE and HANS KLINGEL Zoologisches Institut der Technischen Universitat Braunschweig, Pockelsstr. 10a, D-3300 Braunschweig, Germany Social structure and relationships in a herd of captive camels were studied in Kenya. During day and night the herd split up irrespective of kinship. Partner preferences existed only in those camels who had previously been kept in a small group separated from the herd. Dominance relationships are anonymous with four levels: a) dominant breeding bulls, b) females and bachelors, c) subadults, and d) calves. No stable leadership was observed, but individual preferences in the walking order existed when the camels left and entered the enclosure. During the night most camels showed an amazing attachment to a particular resting site; in a new boma they used corresponding sites. During moon nights activity was greatly increased.

Birds were also tested to determine if they could distinguish between a 'nestmate' (the bird they were raised with), versus an unfamiliar bird of the nestmate's species. All choices involved com- binations of the two species. After thirty days of being raised with another individual (approximately day 10 to day 40 post-hatch), each experimental subject was tested in a weight-sensitive electronic 'choice'</page><page sequence="244">886 VOLUME 118 apparatus. Blue jays preferred the company of a nestmate over a non-nestmate. Blue jays also chose the nestmate's species when given a choice between two unfamiliar birds, robins chose the alternative to the nestmate's species and did not discriminate between the nestmate and its conspecific. Behaviour Vol. 118 (1991) pp. 127-143 FEEDING HABITS AND PREDATORY BEHAVIOUR IN THE MARBLED POLECAT (VORMELA PEREGUSNA SYRIACA): I. KILLING METHODS IN RELATION TO PREY SIZE AND PREY BEHAVIOUR MERAV BEN-DAVID, SERGIO M. PELLIS and VIVIEN C. PELLIS Dept. of Zoology, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat Aviv 69978, Israel The marbled polecat (Vormela peregusna syriaca), a small musteline, is represented in the fauna of Israel. Predatory behaviour of eleven marbled polecats, caught in the field, and held in captivity for a reproductive biology study, was observed during their routine feedings over the course of two years. Sequences of prey capture and killing were recorded on film or videotape. Killed prey were also retrieved for autopsy. Prey offered included Gallus gallus domesticus, Mus musculus, Acomys cahirinus, Microtus guentheri, Meriones tristrami, Cavia porcellus and Rattus norvegicus. All prey items were obtained as surplus from medical laboratories. In addition to using the typical musteline killing method of biting the nape of the neck, marbled polecats used a variety of killing methods suited to a range of prey types. Two variables determined the killing method used. 1) Size of prey: Small prey were killed by bites to the thorax, whereas large prey were bitten on the head or neck. 2) Prey defense behaviour: Fleeing prey were bitten dorsally, whereas defending prey were bitten ventrally, typically on the throat. This non-stereotypical predatory behaviour appears to correlate with the opportunistic feeding habits of marbled polecats in the wild. Evolutionary and ecological aspects of this relationship are discussed. Behaviour Vol. 118 (1991) pp. 144-155 STABILIZATION OF SEXUAL PREFERENCES BY SEXUAL EXPERIENCE IN MALE ZEBRA FINCHES TAENIOPYGIA GUTTATA CASTANOTIS HANS-JOACHIM BISCHOF and NICKY CLAYTON Lehrstuhl fur Verhaltensphysiologie, Universitat Bielefeld, Postfach 8640, 4800 Bielefeld 1, Germany Male zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata castanotis, were normally-raised by zebra finches or were cross- fostered to Bengalese finch, Lonchura striata, foster-parents until 40 days of age. Following isolation until day 100, half the birds in each group were housed with a zebra finch female for seven days, isolated for three days and then housed with a Bengalese finch female for seven days. The other birds were exposed to females in the reverse order. Subsequent double-choice tests showed that all the normally- raised birds preferred zebra finch females whereas the preferences of cross-fostered males depended on the order of exposure to the two females: those exposed first to a Bengalese finch female preferred Bengalese finch females whereas of those exposed first to a zebra finch female, some preferred zebra finches, some preferred Bengalese finches and some showed no marked preference for either female. In order to examine the question of why the latter group showed such marked individual variation in their sexual preferences, a further group of males were cross-fostered to Bengalese finches and exposed to a zebra finch female and then to a Bengalese finch female and their behaviours were observed from day 21 until day 40 and for the two, seven-day periods with the females. The results show that, when comparing brothers within clutches, the one that begs and is fed more by its foster-parents develops a stronger preference for Bengalese finch females and that the more song phrases a male directs to the zebra finch female during the first seven-day period, the stronger the sexual preference for zebra finch females in the double-choice tests. Hence, our results conform and extend those of IMMELMANN et al. (1991) and KRUIJT &amp; MEEUWISSEN (1991) that sexual imprinting may be a two step process. As a first step, information about the parents is learnt during a sensitive period early in life. In a second step, this information has to be tested for its validity for the selection of a sexual partner during first courtship encounters. It is this second step where the previously stored information is stabilized in memory. Giving conflicting information during the first</page><page sequence="245">VOLUME 118 887 and the second step, one can show that interactions between the young male and its parents as well as with its first sexual partner influence the final preference it shows in subsequent double choice tests. Behaviour Vol. 118 (1991) pp. 157-169 EVIDENCE THAT FEMALE RAZORBILLS CONTROL EXTRA-PAIR COPULATIONS RICHARD H. WAGNER Department of Zoology, Edward Grey Institute of Field Ornithology, South Parks Road, Oxford OXI 3PS, United Kingdom Several lines of evidence from a study of razorbill mating strategies indicate that females determine whether extra-pair copulations result in insemination: a. Direct observation suggested that males could not overcome female resistance; b. Females allowed repeated EPC attempts from the same male when they could have departed; c. No EPC attempts of post-egg-laying females were successful, but many were successful before laying, suggesting that females permitted insemination only when they could benefit from it; d. Males sometimes ceased attempting EPCs with females who persistently demonstrated unwillingness to copulate; e. Female behaviour has raised the possibility that sperm may be expelled. Two additional lines of evidence are deduced from a comparison of razorbill data with published accounts of the closely related common guillemot Uria aalge, in which forced EPCs are reported to occur regularly; (f) Male guillemots guard their mates with much greater vigilance than male razorbills, and (g) Male guillemots attempt EPCs by disrupting within-pair copulations and trying to force the pair female, while male razorbills decline such opportunities. The ability of females to control EPCs is important because it enables them to pursue a mixed reproductive strategy without suffering the costs of unwanted inseminations. Behaviour Vol. 118 (1991) pp. 170-186 FREQUENT COPULATIONS AND MATE GUARDING AS ALTERNATIVE PATERNITY GUARDS IN BIRDS: A COMPARATIVE STUDY A.P. M0LLER and T.R. BIRKHEAD Department of Zoology, Uppsala University, Box 561, S-751 22 Uppsala, Sweden, and Department of Animal and Plant Sciences, University of Sheffield, Sheffield SlO 2TN, Great Britain Male birds use a number of paternity guards to increase their certainty of paternity. Mate guarding ap- pears to be the primary paternity guard, whereas frequent intra-pair copulations are used when males for ecological reasons are unable to closely guard their mates (e.g. in in colonially breeding species where one pair member continuously has to guard the nest site against conspecifics, and in species where males provide their mates with all food during the fertile period). We tested whether mate guarding and frequent copulations are alternative paternity guards in a comparative study of the copulation behaviour of 173 bird species with detailed information available. The data base was reduced to statistically independent ob- servations by calculating contrasts (standardized linear differences) between different taxa for copulation frequency, presence of mate guarding, mating system and body mass. Contrasts in mate guarding were strongly negatively related to contrasts in copulation frequency suggesting that they are alternative strate- gies. Body mass was unrelated to both of the alternative paternity guards, as revealed by weak negative correlations between contrasts in body mass and contrasts in frequent copulations and mate guarding, re- spectively. Males of taxa with mating systems with the most extreme skew in mating success (i.e. highly polygynous taxa) were characterised by an absence of both the frequent copulation and the mate guarding paternity guards.</page><page sequence="246">888 VOLUME 118 Behaviour Vol. 118 (1991) pp. 187-213 MALE DOMINANCE AND COPULATION DISRUPTION DO NOT EXPLAIN VARIANCE IN MALE MATING SUCCESS ON SHARP-TAILED GROUSE (TYMPANUCHUS PHASIANELLUS) LEKS MICHAEL W. GRATSON, GRETCHEN K. GRATSON and ARTHUR T. BERGERUD Department of Biology, University of Victoria, Victoria, B.C. V8W 2Y2, and EG &amp; G Idaho, Inc., Box 1625, Idaho Falls, ID 83415 This study tested two hypotheses: that male-male competition and dominance relationships among males, rather than female choice of mates, principally determined the extreme variance in male mating success at sharp-tailed grouse leks; and, that male-male competition and dominance relationships among males principally determined the structure of the lek mating system as suggested by the recent "hotshot" model of lek organization (BEEHLER &amp; FOSTER, 1988). Not all males in the study population obtained lek territories and more of those males that did were adults and had longer tarsometatarses than non-lekking males, which only visited leks and displayed elsewhere. There were no differences between lekking and non-lekking males in mean body mass, wing length, and supraorbital comb size however. Dominant males, where dominance was measured by differences in the frequency that males were disrupted during courtship of females by neighbours, were not the most successful at obtaining copulations at leks. This is the strongest evidence that we have against the complete applicability of the hotshot model to our population of sharp-tailed grouse. Dominance status could not be predicted on the basis of body size, comb size, or age class. Dominant males were not the owners of the most centrally-located territories, nor were the territories of the most successful males at obtaining copulations taken over by more dominant males after successful males were removed from their territories. These results too provide evidence against the applicability of the hotshot model to out population of sharp-tailed grouse. Copulation disruptions by neighbouring males were common at leks. Copulations were more likely to be unsuccessful when they were disrupted than otherwise and remating by individual females occurred more often after they were disrupted than otherwise. However, based on limited sample sizes, females were apparently no more likely to remate with the disrupting male than with any other and copulation disruptions only redistributed copulations among an already successful number of males. Only 26% of the variance in male mating success could be explained in a multiple regression by any two- or three-variable combination of male traits and this was explained by variance in male size and number of yellow leg-bands. Male mating success and male size were inversely correlated in individual tests of significance; on average, smaller males apparently obtained more matings. The more centrally-located males apparently obtained more matings, but territory location was not cor- related with any other variable except (perhaps) survival. There was a tendency for surviving males to change from more exterior to more interior locations in successive years, apparently as a result of new males settling around them rather than as a result of direct competition for interior spots. Male removal experiments were performed in which the most successful males were removed on each of number of leks. Contrary to predictions of the hotshot model (BEEHLER &amp; FOSTER, 1988), male recruitment to these leks and the numbers of females visiting and mating at these leks the following year did not decline, and there was no increase in the frequency of disrupted copulations in the year following male removal. Consistent with the hotshot model, however, the variance in male success apparently declined at two of three leks in the year following male removal. Behaviour Vol. 118 (1991) pp. 214-234 VARIATION IN SCHOOLING AND AGGRESSION AMONGST GUPPY (POECILIA RETICULATA) POPULATIONS IN TRINIDAD ANNA E. MAGURRAN and BENONI H. SEGHERS Animal Behaviour Research Group, Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford OXI 3PS, U.K. Schooling behaviour is an effective defence against predation but, since it depends on coordinated behav- iour, it may restrict individual competition for limited resources. We tested the hypothesis that levels of individual aggression will be reduced in fish with a high schooling tendency by comparing the behaviour of guppies, Poecilia reticulata, from eight Trinidad populations. Schooling tendency was assayed in the wild. Fish were then transferred to the laboratory where aggression was measured when groups of eight</page><page sequence="247">VOLUME 118 889 males foraged on a small, but profitable, food patch. An inverse relationship between schooling tendency and intensity of aggression emerged. Guppies from populations without fish predators displayed a wide range of aggressive behaviours including active patch defence by the most dominant individual. Con- versely, populations experiencing high predation, and with well-developed schooling behaviour, showed little aggression. Female guppies (three population tested) also varied in level of aggression and aggres- sion was present in laboratory-bred as well as wild-caught fish. Individual aggression increased with group size but was independent of tank size. These results point towards a trade-off between antipredator behaviour and resource defence and confirm that schooling has associated costs as well as benefits.

ALLOWAY and DAVID RYCKMAN Erindale College, University of Toronto, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada L5L 1C6 In the first experiment, field-collected colonies of L. ambiguus Emery discriminated between nestmate queens and queens from other conspecific colonies. In the second experiment, groups of L. ambiguus workers matured from pupae and spent the first 14 days of their adult lives with either an L. ambiguus queen from the workers' parental colony, an L. ambiguus queen from another colony, an L. longispinosus Roger queen, or a Protomognathus americanus (Emery) slavemaker queen. Sixteen worker groups served in each of the four experimental conditions. At the end of the familiarization period, the queens with which the workers had been living were removed and the worker groups were tested by reintroducing the familiar queen and an unfamiliar queen from the workers' parental colony. Workers familiarized with a queen from their own colony did not distinguish her from another queen from the same colony. In the other three conditions, workers bit the familiar queen less and groomed and non-hostilely touched her more than the unfamiliar queen. These results indicate that L. ambiguus workers learn social attachments to queens. Behaviour Vol. 118 (1991) pp. 244-274 SONG SHARING IN A GROUP-LIVING SONGBIRD, THE AUSTRALIAN MAGPIE, GYMNORHINA TIBICEN. PART III. SEX SPECIFICITY AND INDIVIDUAL SPECIFICITY OF VOCAL PARTS IN COMMUNAL CHORUS AND DUET SONGS ELEANOR D. BROWN Department of Psychology, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742, USA SUSAN M. FARABAUGH Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand In this paper we continue our study of the role of song in the social behavior of a cooperatively living songbird, the Australian magpie, Gymnorhina tibicen (Cracticidae). In this species, all members of a cooperative group sing and fight together in defense of their territory. Communal chorus songs consist of loud carol syllables; each individual sings a particular vocal role. We sampled the song repertoires of 24 magpies in 12 territorial groups in Queensland, Australia, and of 12 magpies in 4 territorial groups in the Manawatu region of New Zealand. Our results include: 1. Description of duet and chorus song. Carol portions of song are usually preceded by an introductory warble segment. Carol syllables are diverse in physical structure. We grouped 204 distinct carol syllables into 11 general classes. 2. Between-sex differences in syllable repertoires. Some syllable classes were sex-specific, and a few were sung by magpies of both sexes. Female-specific syllables were more complex structurally than those of males. Females had significantly (p &lt; 0.001) larger and more varied repertoires than males. Most syllables were individual-specific, but low levels of syllable sharing did occur. 3. Within-sex differences in syllable repertoires. We found no significant difference (p &gt; 0.5) in the average percentage of the repertoire shared between same-sex birds who were vs were not territorial neighbors at our Queensland study site. 4. Carol song repertoires. The number of duet song types in each group's repertoire varied widely from group to group. Females had significantly (p &lt;0.05) larger song repertoires than their mates.</page><page sequence="248">890 VOLUME 118 5. Carol development in young birds. A young magpie seemed to sing variants of the carol syllables of only one parent, perhaps the same-sex parent, and echoed the parent's carol syllables during communal choruses. 6. Geographic variation in carol syllables. Carol syllables of individuals at our New Zealand study site were also sex-specific, and could be grouped into general classes. No syllables were the same as those recorded from the Australian study birds. 7. Song context. We compared the amount of time magpie groups spent warbling, warble-caroling, and not singing, during five commonly occurring types of contexts.

Behaviour Vol. 118 (1991) pp. 275-296 PATTERNS OF VISUALLY OBSERVABLE BEHAVIOUR AND VOCALIZATIONS IN GROUPS OF FEMALE SPERM WHALES HAL WHITEHEAD and LINDA WEILGART Department of Biology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia B3H 4J1, Canada Hourly records of the visible activities and vocalizations of groups of female and immature sperm whales, Physeter macrocephalus, off the Galapagos Islands were used to investigate relationships between vo- calizations and visible activities, and to examine patterns of behaviour. There were strong correlations between most recorded variables, and multivariate analysis showed the rates of performing visually ob- servable activities and vocalizing to be largely represented by an axis which is termed Sociality. About three quarters of the time sperm whales engaged in relatively stereotyped foraging for food, diving regu- larly, moving steadily, appearing only briefly at the surface in small clusters, and making regularly spaced trains of 'usual' clicks. However, for periods which usually lasted either about one or about five hours, and often in the afternoon, the whales would aggregate at the surface, usually in large, slow-moving clusters, often making patterned series of clicks called 'codas'. There was considerable variation in the behaviour observed, and sounds heard, during these periods of Aggregation. The mean levels of Sociality did not vary significantly between years, with season or with a measure of feeding success. The results are con- sistent with the hypothesis that a primary function of these periods at the surface is the maintenance of social bonds, although other functions are not excluded.

DE WAAL Wisconsin Regional Primate Research Center, University of Wisconsin-Madison, and Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center and Department of Psychology, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322, U.S.A. Studies of primate social cognition aim at a) documentation of social behaviors that appear to require an understanding in the animals of their own relationships and the relationships among others; an ability to anticipate behavioral effects; intentionally, and so on, and b) determination of the psychological mech- anisms and mental abilities underlying this complex sociality. Thus far, the first area of investigation, which is largely descriptive, has reveived more attention than the second. The most parsimonious assumption concerning nonhuman primates is that if their behavior resembles human behavior the psychological and mental processes involved are probably similar too. This is not the same as uncritically accepting the existence of these processes; alternative hypotheses need to be formulated and tested. The present paper advocates research over a broad spectrum, with reliance on a variety of methods, and emphasis on covergent evidence. Because each method has its own strengths and weaknesses, the most convincing support for a particular explanation will involve data from a number of sources, both observational and experimental. Four research methods are discussed: Qualitative description. Sometimes referred to as "anecdotalism", this method seeks to document the animals' spontaneous solutions to unusual social problems, and exploitation of rare opportunities. This method provides a starting point for research if it suggests remarkable cognitive capacities. It is unsuitable, however, for a conclusive comparison of alternative explanations.</page><page sequence="249">VOLUME 118 891 Quantitative description. The first goal of systematic research is to delineate the range of tenable hypothe- ses about the phenomenon of interest, i.e. to establish the cognitively least demanding explanation that cannot be rejected as well as the most demanding explanation that seems reasonable given the species' general intelligence level. The second goal is to compare alternative explanations. The advantage of quantitative description is that it can be applied in natural or naturalistic settings; the disadvantage is that it lacks control over variables. Controlled observation. A pseudo-experimental procedure that aims at controlling certain variables. An observation following a particular event is compared with an observation unpreceded by the same event but matched to the first observation on a number of other dimensions. A disadvantage, compared to experimentation, is the dependency on spontaneous events. Experimentation. Manipulation of the animal's experience and available information is a powerful tool to select among alternative cognitive explanations. The disadvantage is that this procedure requires an unusual environment and human involvement, both of which may alter behavior. Experimental results are particularly convincing, therefore, if they agree with knowledge gained by means of observational techniques.</page><page sequence="250">892 VOLUME 119 Behaviour Vol. 119 (1991) pp. 1-29 SOCIALISATION TACTICS OF THE SPECTACLED PARROTLET (FORPUS CONSPICILLATUS) KYRA GARNETZKE-STOLLMANN and DIERK FRANCK Zoologisches Institut und Zoologisches Museum der Universitat, Arbeitsbereich Ethologie, Martin-Luther-King-Platz 3, D-2000 Hamburg 13, Germany Spectacled parrotlets live in a complex system of individual relationships throughout their lives. The adults form exclusive pair bonds, addressing all friendly and sexual behaviour patterns to each other. Pair mates cooperate in agonistic situations. As long as they stay close together they hold the same rank-order position. In mate-choice experiments females (not males) significantly preferred a mate which formerly held a high social position. There are also non-exclusive pair bonds, which are far less stable than exclusive ones. Only exclusive pairs have a good chance to occupy a breeding cavity. All group members are synchronized in many of their activities, such as foraging, preening or resting. They are keenly interested in unusual activities of other group members. Social learning, including copying sexual techniques, seems to be essential. After fledging the parents keep their offspring at a distance from a very early stage. Instead of a close parent-offspring relationship the fledglings form sibling groups with their nest mates. Over a period of months siblings remain the main interaction partners for all friendly and playful activities. They also support one another in agonistic situations. In the first months of life even courtship feeding and sexual behaviour are addressed predominantly to siblings. Thus a pair-like relationship is established between siblings, anticipating the permanent pair bond of adults. Single fledglings, deprived of the experience of a sibling group, remained poorly integrated into the group. They developed alternative socialisation tactics, namely (1) joining a host group of unrelated siblings, (2) renewing a friendly partnership with the parents, (3) helping to protect and feed younger siblings or even unrelated fledglings and (4) seeking early partnership with unrelated group members. Out of 10 single fledglings only the one that was accepted by a host sibling group immediately after fledgling became well integrated into the whole group and reproduced well. It is argued that sibling groups offer good opportunities for learning partnership and function as a safe basis for exploring the social environment. It is tentatively proposed that single fledglings have a decreased probability of reproductive success. Behaviour Vol. 119 (1991) pp. 30-50 ALLOMATERNAL CARE BY FEMALE WEDGE-CAPPED CAPUCHIN MONKEYS: EFFECTS OF AGE, RANK AND RELATEDNESS TIMOTHY G. O'BRIEN and JOHN G. ROBINSON Dept. of Wildlife and Range Sciences, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida 3261 1, U.S.A. We examined patterns of infant care and the relative importance of female age, rank and relatedness to allomaternal care for a wild population of wedge-capped capuchin monkeys, Cebus olivaceus in Venezuela. Mothers interacted primarily with their own infants throughout the study. Infant age affected the timing and type of allomaternal interaction; investigation occurred primarily in the first 3 months of life, carrying was dominant during the second 3 months, and association occurred primarily in the third 3 months. The onset and level of allomaternal care assured a high level of infant care as maternal care was declining, suggesting that allomaternal care is an important component of infant survival. The relative importance of female age, rank and relatedness varied for different behaviour. Relatedness was the most consistently important effect. Sibling females participated in allomaternal care almost 4 times more often than other females and were especially active in carrying and associating with infants. Female rank was an important effect when the coefficient of relatedness was less than 0.5: high-ranking females participated in allomaternal care more than low-ranking females. Old juveniles and nulliparous adults interacted with infants more than young juveniles and parous adults, but the effect of female age was relatively unimportant. Allomaternal nursing may represent a form of reciprocal altruism. Allomaternal nursing supplemented maternal nursing and was unrelated to kinship or rank of female.</page><page sequence="251">VOLUME 119 893 Behaviour Vol. 119 (1991) pp. 51-64 INSEMINATION TEMPORARILY INHIBITS SEXUAL RESPONSIVENESS IN FEMALE SALAMANDERS (DESMOGNATHUS OCHROPHAEUS) PAUL A. VERRELL Department of Ecology and Evolution, The University of Chicago, 940 East 57th Street, Chicago, IL 60637, U.S.A. After successful courtship and mating in the mountain dusky salamander (Desmognathus ochrophaeus), sperm masses remained externally visible in the cloacae of females for as long as 24 h (Experiment 1). When mated females were exposed to males for a second time, they appeared to be attractive and were subjected to courtship, but they seldom became inseminated (Experiment 2). Courtship and mating appear to result in a temporary inhibition of female sexual responsiveness. Females whose sperm masses were removed on the morning following successful insemination were more likely to become inseminated during a second encounter than were females whose masses were left in situ (Experiment 3). This suggests that it is the presence of a sperm mass, not simply exposure to stimulation produced by males during courtship, that inhibits female sexual responsiveness. In Experiment 4, a small styrofoam ball was placed into the cloacae of females with no recent courtship experience. When paired with males, females bearing "surrogate" sperm masses exhibited lowered courtship frequencies similar to those of recently-mated females, suggesting that physical stimulation of the female cloaca is sufficient to inhibit female sexual responsiveness. Subtle manipulation of female sexual responsiveness by males probably does not occur in Desmognathus ochrophaeus. Behaviour Vol. 119 (1991) pp. 65-76 ASSESSMENT OF PATCH PROFITABILITY AND IDEAL FREE DISTRIBUTION: THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SAMPLING VYTENIS GOTCEITAS and PATRICK COLGAN Department of Biology, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada K7L 3N6 When allowed access to two food patches differing in food availability, groups of six adult, female, threespined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus, L.) distributed themselves between patches according to the ratio of patch profitability, as predicted by the ideal free distribution (IFD) model. However, when individual fish were subsequently prevented from physically sampling patches differing in both food availability and the number of conspecifics present, patch choice did not conform to IFD. Instead, individuals preferred the patch with the greatest number of conspecifics present, regardless of potential foraging rewards. Preference for patches with the greatest number of conspecifics was, however, only evident when conspecifics were feeding. An outline of the decision process used by sticklebacks when selecting among food patches is presented.

LOCATI Centro Studi Ecologici Appenninici, Parco Nazionale d'Abruzzo, 67032 Pescasseroli AQ, Italy The reproductive behaviour of adult male Apennine chamois was studied during 4 rutting seasons in the Abruzzo National Park, Central Italy. The analysis of temporal relationships between behaviour patterns in male-male and male-female reper- toires has allowed to group together the patterns functionally associated. Courtship activities were much more predictable and fixed than behaviours in male-male interactions. Qualitative and quantitative variations of the main behaviour patterns have been evaluated throughout the rut. November 8-12 marked the start of the intense phase of the rut. Two of the 3 species-specific courtship behaviours appeared in the peak of the rut (November 23-27).</page><page sequence="252">894 VOLUME 119 Older males grouped and successfully defended larger harems, containing a greater number of prime females. Males herded females mainly by the Head Down threat, in both the still and moving postures. The aggressive connotation of the Snort, an usually assumed "alarm" call, has been here discussed in the harem formation context. The courtship sequence has been described. The function of female reactive urination was evaluated in this context. A harem holder did not only have to prevent females from leaving, but he had also to deal with male competitors. Usually long agonistic interactions occurred before a Rush or a Chase ended up the contest between 2 males. The Neck Up has been presented here as an effective posture to display the "Attention Guiding Adaptations" present in the body morphology of adult male chamois. Direct correlations were found between the age (i.e. the dominance) of an intruder and the distance at which it was pursued away by the harem holder, as well as the Marking/Homing activity of the latter. The frequency of utterance of the Rut Call built up 60% of all behaviour patterns recorded (N = 8059). It was also used often (36.3%; N = 102) to initiate a contest as a vocal dominance display. Harem holders showed a positive correlation of call frequency to the harem females with the rut progression. The last 2 aspects suggest a strong similarity of function to what found for the red deer in assessing the contender's ranks and in enhancing the oestrus of females. The comparison of male rutting behaviour in Apennine chamois with that reported for other Rupicapra taxa indicated a close affinity with the Pyrenees subspecies and detectable differences with the northeastern chamois. Behaviour Vol. 119 (1991) pp. 104-126 THE EFFECT OF THERMOREGULATORY BEHAVIOUR ON THE MATING SYSTEM OF THE JUAN FERNANDEZ FUR SEAL, ARCTOCEPHALUS PHILIPPII JOHN M. FRANCIS and DARYL J. BONESS Department of Zoological Research, National Zoological Park, Washington, D.C. 20008, U.S.A. Recent studies of fur seals and sea lions (Otariids) which are cold water adapted, indicate that social behaviour in hotter climes is constrained by the form and availability of cool substrate provided by the rookery environment. This first study of the behaviour of the Juan Ferrnndez fur seal provides new evidence of this relationship and the extent to which thermoregulatory requirements can affect social behaviour in pinnipeds. Females of this species on Alejandro Selkirk Island made daily movements from inland pupping and rest sites to the shoreline and into the water in response to rapid increases in solar radiation to levels exceeding 1.3 cal/cm2/min. Thirty percent of these females floated and groomed offshore in the afternoon in areas protected from the surf by offshore islets and rocky reefs. Males held territories on land either along the shoreline (39%) or in land-locked areas (45%) as is typical of fur seals, or held completely aquatic territories (16%) that encompassed the site where females floated. The average aquatic male, present on territory primarily during the afternoon hours when females floated offshore, achieved as many copulations as did the average land-locked or shoreline male. Land-locked males often abandoned their territories for short periods (45 minutes on average) in response to increasing solar radiation in the afternoon and at a time when female numbers on land were low. The existence of aquatic territoriality as a successful mating strategy has not yet been documented for any other otariid. The occurrence of this behavioural strategy is likely a product of the interaction of thermoregulatory constraints and topographical features which together promote predictable aggregations of females offshore. This study further substantiates that constraints on female aggregation appear to dictate the range and mode of male mating strategies in otariids. Behaviour Vol. 119 (1991) pp. 127-142 LONG ULTRASONIC CALLS IN MALE RATS FOLLOWING MATING, DEFEAT AND AVERSIVE STIMULATION: FREQUENCY MODULATION AND BOUT STRUCTURE AUGUSTINUS M. VAN DER POEL and KLAUS A. MICZEK Department of Pharmacology, Sylvius Laboratories, State University Leiden, Leiden, The Netherlands and Department of Psychology, Tufts University, Medford, MA 01890, USA Ultrasonic calls by rats may represent affective expressions and serve communicative functions. The temporal patterning and frequency modulation of the long, 21-30 .kHz ultrasonic calls were studied in</page><page sequence="253">VOLUME 119 895 7 male rats. Following ejaculation, defeat and aversive stimulation large samples of consecutive long calls were recorded and analyzed off-line using a spectrum analyzer. The analysis was limited to long calls because other types of calls were relatively rare under the circumstances of this study and the emitter could be determined by a typical breathing pattern with reasonable certainty only for long calls. Log survivor analysis of the intervals between calls revealed that rats emit 95% of long calls in bouts of less than 6 calls. Except for the higher bout rate after defeat, there were no significant differences between tests in call duration, percent time spent vocalizing, bout duration and intervals between bouts. However, there were significant differences between individuals across tests in call duration, number of calls per bout and bout rate. The pattern and capacity to breathe are likely important limiting factors for several temporal characteristics of rat ultrasounds, in particular maximal call duration and range of interval duration within a bout. Post-ejaculatory calls were often strongly modulated in frequency (i.e. pitch) in the medial and terminal segments. These segments of calls emitted after defeat or aversive stimulation were essentially monoto- nous. We propose that rats emit at least 2 types of long ultrasonic calls-one monotonous, the other modulated- each reflecting a different affective state of the animal. The modulated type may reflect a state of behavioral inhibition such as initiated by ejaculation whereas the monotonous type may reflect a state of intense fear induced by an actual physical threat in situations where escape is blocked. Both types may serve a "desist- contact" function. Behaviour Vol. 119 (1991) pp. 143-160 "COO" VOCALIZATIONS IN STUMPTAILED MACAQUES: A CONTROLLED FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS K.A. BAUERS and FRANS B.M. DE WAAL Wisconsin Regional Primate Research Center, University of Wisconsin, Madison, U.S.A. Coo vocalizations have been described in the communication systems of several macaque species. Their use has been suggested to reflect the emitter's "internal state", with regard to motivation for social contact. The idea that the production of Coos reflects a desire for contact has never been critically evaluated; the effectiveness of these signals in facilitating contact between the emitter and others has not been demonstrated. We designed a study to test the function of Coo vocalizations in adult stumptailed macaques (Macaca arctoides), using control measures similar to those first employed in research on reconciliation behavior in macaques (DE WAAL &amp; YOSHIHARA, 1983). We found that the probability of an approach leading to friendly contact was significantly greater following a female's Coo vocalizations than it was during control trials. Analysis of the social context of the focal animal as it emits a Coo (its "initial state"), provides indirect evidence that Coos are "contact calls". We found that stumptails were significantly more likely to be alone than in contact with others when they emitted a Coo. Females were more likely to repeat their Coo vocalizations if they did not achieve friendly contact within 30 s. This result is in line with the view of Coo vocalizations as part of a feed-back loop with affiliative social contact as the goal state. Coos were produced by other adult females at a higher rate and with a shorter latency following the focal female's Coos than they were in control trials. Response vocalizations may affirm, to the "cooing" female, the presence and location of other troop members. On the basis of the non-vocal behavioral changes that these signals predict, Coos may be viewed as social tools, used to influence conspecifics, in addition to whatever their use may reflect regarding an emitter's "internal state". We suggest that the use of Coos to solicit approach may be a convention for the avoidance of aggression. Behaviour Vol. 119 (1991) pp. 161-170 MUTUAL RECIPROCITY OF GROOMING IN FEMALE JAPANESE MACAQUES (MACACA FUSCATA) YASUYUKI MUROYAMA Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University, Inuyama, Aichi 484, Japan Grooming interactions among female Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) were observed and compared between affiliated and unaffilitated non-related pairs, mother and adult female offspring paris, and mother and immature offspring pairs. Unaffiliated (rarely interacting) members of pairs were likely to approach and then groom the other, in contrast to affiliated (frequently interacting) pairs, who more often approached and then solicited grooming from the other. The return receipt of a benefit just given, in the form of reciprocation of grooming, was immediate in non-related pairs. The brief interval between the occurrence</page><page sequence="254">896 VOLUME 119 of reciprocation facilitated the estimation of receiving as much benefit as was given in the case of rare grooming. However, such was not the case for related pairs. Adult female offspring solicited grooming from mothers more than immature offspring. The findings are discussed with reference to previous theories about the evolution of altruistic behaviour. Behaviour Vol. 119 (1991) pp. 171-192 SEXUAL BEHAVIOR OF MALE NORTHERN ELEPHANT SEALS: III. THE MOUNTING OF WEANED PUPS NAOMI A. ROSE, CHARLES J. DEUTSCH and BURNEY J. LE BOEUF Department of Biology, University of California, Santa Cruz, California 95064, U.S.A. 1. Up to 50% of weaned northern elephant seal pups, Mirounga angustirostris, present on the Anlo Nuevo mainland rookery at the end of the breeding season showed evidence (tooth marks and injuries on the neck) of having been mounted by males. 2. Male-inflicted injuries on weanlings ranged from superficial tooth marks to deep gashes and punctures that bled and exposed the blubber. Most marks were superficial. 3. Approximately 0.5% of all weaned pups died on the rookery from 1969-1990; about 35% of the dead weanlings showed physical evidence that they were killed by males and males were suspected of having killed most of the rest. 4. Males mounting weanlings displayed many behaviors that are characteristic of male sexual behavior toward adult females and most weanlings responded like non-estrous females. Weanling mounts lasted an average of 2.8 min (N = 81) and were usually terminated when the male did not pursue an escaping weanling. There was no bias in the sex or the size of mounted weanlings. 5. Males also mounted conspecific juveniles (one and two years old), although these interactions were relatively infrequent because most juveniles were at sea during the breeding season. The behavior of males and juveniles during mounting attempts was qualitatively similar to weanling mounts; rarely, yearlings were killed by males. 6. Most mounters (91%) were subadult males and were observed to mount weanlings only once in a breeding season. Occasionally, a male persisted in mounting weanlings repeatedly, within a season and across years. Weanling mounters did not differ from other males in their proximity to harems or in their copulatory success. 7. The proximate factors leading to weanling mounts appear to be male sexual inexperience, high libido, limited access to adult females, and stimulus generalization. Functionally, male sexual behavior toward weanlings appears to be a low-cost by-product of high male sexual motivation that may enhance a male's reproductive success. Weanlings exhibit behaviors, such as grouping into pods, seeking microhabitat refuges, and resisting mounts, that may reduce the chance of being mounted by a male or of being injured during a mounting attempt. Behaviour Vol. 119 (1991) pp. 193-224 LEVELS OF FEMALE CHOICE IN THE WHITE-TAILED SKIMMER PLATHEMIS LYDIA (ODONATA: LIBELLULIDAE) WALTER D. KOENIG Hastings Reservation and Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, University of California, Carmel Valley 93924, U.S.A. Male Plathemis lydia defend mating territories along the perimeter of ponds. Females come to ponds for brief periods of time every few days to oviposit. During these visits, females actively discriminate among males, rejecting up to 48.9% of mating attempts. Males varied significantly in the proportion of attempts successfully leading to copulation. However, males that obtained more matings also experienced more rejections. Extensive analyses based on absolute male size, relative male size, and male size relative to female size yielded only marginally significant evidence of female mate preference based on body mass, wing length, wing loading index, or age; to the extent that any of these characters appeared to influence mating success, they similarly influenced refusal rates. The overall weakness of female mate choice is further suggested by the frequency of females ovipositing without prior matings and by the low frequency with which females remate with the same males. On a population basis, females strongly prefer to oviposit in the middle of the day and at particular parts of the study pond. Thus, females exhibit strong choice at several levels. However, despite the high incidence of active female rejection and high variance in male mating success, mate choice is apparently</page><page sequence="255">VOLUME 119 897 of minor importance in this population. Female discrimination of males, combined with variance in male mating success, are necessary but not sufficient for the action of sexual selection via mate choice. These findings support the prediction that male-male competition is of primary importance in resource control mating systems in which males are able to control female access to most or all favored oviposition sites. However, it is not clear why females generally fail to discriminate among males, given that they have the opportunity to do so. In general, females appear to have low motivation to mate with males, presumably because multiple mating does not significantly increase their fertility or fecundity. Selection for rapid mating may be significant, both because of predation on females during mating and oviposition and because of the risks for males of losing their territories during mating bouts. This time constraint may be the most important factor limiting female discrimination among males on the basis of consistent characteristics. Behaviour Vol. 119 (1991) pp. 225-242 RESPONSE OF MALE INDIGO AND LAZULI BUNTINGS AND THEIR HYBRIDS TO SONG PLAYBACK IN ALLOPATRIC AND SYMPATRIC POPULATIONS MYRON CHARLES BAKER Department of Biology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado 80523, USA The hybridizing semispecies indigo and lazuli buntings (Passerina cyanea, P amoena) were studied in song playback experiments in allopatric and sympatric populations. In allopatry, males of both species responded strongly to conspecific and weakly to heterospecific songs. In sympatry, indigo, lazuli and hybrid males reacted equally and strongly to both indigo and lazuli songs. Alteration of song structures, by presenting indigo syllables in lazuli temporal pattern and lazuli syllables in indigo temporal pattern, showed that the response of allopatric indigo and lazuli males was determined primarily by syllabic (phonological) cues in the test songs and not by the temporal pattern. The overall pattern of male response in sympatry and allopatry provides some understanding of the observed degree of reproductive isolation between these species.

KRAAK Zoological Laboratory, University of Groningen, P.O. Box 14, 9750 AA Haren, The Netherlands JOHN J. VIDELER Department of Marine Biology, University of Groningen, P.O. Box 14, 9750 AA Haren, The Netherlands Criteria for female mate choice were investigate in a natural population of a Mediterranean blenny, Aidablennius sphynx. Removable test tubes in concrete blocks were offered as nests. Each tube was guarded by a male and females laid eggs in the tubes. Nests with larger broods received significantly more spawning females. The numbers of eggs laid increased with brood size from empty nests to intermediate brood sizes, but this tendency is reversed if nests contain very large broods. Nests with and without broods were exchanged experimentally among males. The number of eggs a male received, after an empty tube was replaced by a tube with eggs, was significantly higher. Conversely, the number of eggs received after a tube with eggs was replaced by an empty tube, was significantly lower. Male display did not increase the probability that females spawned. Male size did not correlate with the numbers of eggs received. It is discussed that female preference for large broods might be adaptive because the number of eggs present in the nest is probably a reliable predictor of the survival chances of the eggs.</page><page sequence="256">898 VOLUME 119 Behaviour Vol. 119 (1991) pp.267-284 OLFACTORY SEARCH IMAGES IN STRIPED SKUNKS VILIS 0. NAMS Department of Biology, University of Victoria, Victoria, B.C., V8W 2Y2, Canada Striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) which had been raised in captivity can increase their reaction distance to the smell of a given food. This reaction distance decreases after they find other types of foods, using either sound or smell. This decrease could be a result of skunks increasing preference for specific food, or shifting attention onto the smell of specific food. However, other experiments showed that skunks do not change prey preference. Therefore the decrease in reaction distance is likely due to skunks shifting attention to the smell of specific food. I suggest that this is the olfactory analogue to visual search images-i.e. olfactory search images. Behaviour Vol. 119 (1991) pp. 285-301 GENESE DE LA SEGREGATION SEXUELLE ET DIFFERENCES COMPORTEMENTALES CHEZ DES ENFANTS D'AGE PRESCOLAIRE FREDERIC LEGAULT and F.F. STRAYER Laboratoire d'Ethologie Humaine, Departement de Psychologie, Universite du Quebec a Montreal, CP 8888-A, Montreal, Quebec, H3C 3P8, Canada Our research traces the emergence of gender differences in early peer relations and examines how such differences are related to the emergence of sexual segregation in pre-school play groups. Participants (41 girls and 51 boys) were distributed in nine stable groups at three age levels (mean ages of 17, 27 and 36 months). Social behavior was coded using an ethological action inventory. Analyses indicated significant main effects for age, sex of subject and sex of partner, as well as interactions between age and sex of social partner. Using an adjusted rate measure of activity directed toward each sex, spontaneous segregation was found to develop at different rates for boys and girls and to vary according to form of social activity. Cross-sectional results clarified the developmental course of early gender socialization. Among the youngest groups, we were unable to detect sex-differences either in social activity, or in peer preferences. At two years, both boys and girls began to develop gender specific behavioral styles, and at this same time, girls showed significant preferences for other girls as partners in affiliative exchange. At three years of age, gender segregation and sex-differences in basic social actions were well established social facts. Sexual segregation produces a highly structured social context that is likely to accentuate and canalize subsequent behavioral development of both boys and girls.

The variables measured were (1) the sound amplitude that averaged 94.8 dB SPL for birds facing toward the microphone and 85.7 dB SPL for birds facing away, (2) the sound attenuation that decreased with about 6 dB per doubling distance, (3) the ratio of the signal to the background noise of the colony which was 20-25 dB during the rearing period of chicks, and (4) the degradation of the signal structure by the scattering medium (penguin bodies) and distance, which affected the timbre, but not the two fundamental frequencies of the call that produced a beat phenomenon. This distance, 4-7 m indicates that the call is transmitted at short- or medium-range, and corresponds closely to the distance covered between two stops where a parent in search for its chick calls. The beat phenomenon undegraded by the scattering medium and distance is likely to serve individual recognition, assuming there is a relationship between the broadcast distance and the functional structure of emperor penguin call.</page><page sequence="257">VOLUME 120 Behaviour Vol. 120 (1992) pp. 1-10 ONSET AND MAINTENANCE OF MATERNAL PREY-SUPPLY ACTIVITY IN THE SPIDER COELOTES TERRESTRIS (ARANEAE, AGELENIDAE) DENIS ASSI BESSEKON, ANDRE HOREL and JEAN-LUC GUNDERMANN U.R.A. C.N.R.S. n0 1293, Laboratoire de Biologie du Comportement et Physiologie, Universit6 de Nancy I, France In the funnel-web spider Coelotes terrestris (Agelenidae) the young are provided with prey by their mother for several weeks following emergence from the egg sac. Such a maternal activity has previously been shown to be influenced by stimuli emitted by the young (i.e. during mother-offspring interactions), which ensures the tuning of the prey supply to the offspring. The present paper aims to shed light on the conditions of onset and maintenance of prey-supply tendency. The experimental procedure consisted in confronting females, either sub-adult or at various stages of their reproductive life cycle, with a group of spiderlings constant in number and age, and in recording the behavioural interactions following the capture of a prey item. Females which did not yet have post-emergence offspring did not supply prey to the spiderlings and exhibited aggressive reactions towards them. In contrast, females which had had post- emergence offspring, even though their dispersal could have taken place many weeks before, provided prey to the experimental spiderlings, and behaved towards them as their real mothers would have done. When exposure to the experimental situation was prolonged for one week, the tendency to supply the young clearly appeared in previously unresponsive adult females (inseminated or incubating), but no change was observed in sub-adults. The results show that, in Coelotes terrestris, the maternal tendency to supply prey requires a particular internal state, which seems to develop at the time of the offspring's emergence but which does not become extinct after their dispersal. The results also suggest that the development of this internal state can somehow be influenced by stimuli from the young. Behaviour Vol. 120 (1992) pp. 11-39 VARIATION IN TIME AND ENERGY BUDGETS OF BREEDING WHEATEARS JUAN MORENO and LARS HILLSTROM Department of Zoology, Box 561, S-751 22 Uppsala, Sweden We examined the sources of variation in time allocation of males and females of the wheatear (Oenanthe oenanthe) on the island of Oland, South Sweden, throughout the breeding season. We quantified rates of prey capture attempts and specified foraging methods used. From respirometric measurements of basal metabolic rate and temperature-dependent metabolism on captive wheatears, and after having made certain assumptions abour the costs of different activities, we estimated the energy budgets of both sexes during the different reproductive phases. Males and females differed in their time allocation and foraging rates during prelaying, laying, and incubation, but not while feeding grown nestlings. During prelaying and laying, females foraged at higher rates than males; they also perched less often, gleaned more on the ground, and flew less. Although incubation was the least costly phase for females because of their low activity, high foraging rates yet indicated that this phase may represent an energetic bottleneck as a result of restrictions on foraging time. After incubation, females switched from foraging mostly on the ground during early breeding phases to hunting from elevated perches during later breeding phases. The shift in foraging behavior corresponds to the drastic changes in time allocation. Relatively high daily energy expenditures (DEE) by brooding females coupled with low foraging rates may explain the observed posthatching body mass losses. In both sexes, high required energy acquisition rates when feeding-large nestlings indicate that parent wheatears then may encounter another energetic bottleneck. Postfledging was the least costly phase because, compared with the period of feeding nestlings, there were reduced thermostatic costs and a marked drop in flight time. Males and females had similar DEEs during prelaying, laying and nestling feeding, but females had lower needs during incubation. The elective components of energy budgets during nestling feeding, as well as the estimated sum of the elective components throughout the season, were 12% higher for males than for females. The elective components of the energy budgets varied more than the obligatory components (basal + thermoregulation), especially in females, and were more important in determining the variation of DEE throughout the breeding season. A validation study with doubly labeled water indicated that the energy budget model used was accurate enough for comparisons between sexes or breeding phases, but not for measuring individual variation. 899</page><page sequence="258">900 VOLUME 120 Behaviour Vol. 120 (1992) pp. 40-50 INTERSPECIFIC AGONISM BETWEEN TWO SYMPATRIC SPECIES OF CTENOMYS (RODENTIA: OCTODONTIDAE) IN CAPTIVITY ALDO I. VASSALLO and CRISTINA BUSCH Departamento de Biologia, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Universidad Nacional de Mar del Plata, Casilla de Correo 1245 (7600) Mar del Plata, Argentina The interspecific agonism between two sympatric species of Ctenomys (C. talarum and C. australis) was studied by means of experimental encounters at the laboratory. Aggression took place in relation to occupation and defence of the Resource Cage (RC: food and space) and Home Cage (HC: own or foreign). Opponent's retreat was preceded by fighting behaviors (animal advancing forward; biting) or without apparent aggression. The species that is two times bigger.-C. australis-dominates the other- C. talarum-. However, the results do not demonstrate that C. australis is more aggressive. C. australis entered the RC more often, stayed longer there, less often brought food to the HC, while C. talarum move food to its HC. The ordination and classification of individuals according to their behavior shows species and sex segregation. Species differences supports the interpretation that a bigger individual is avoided more than a smaller one: C. talarum evades C. australis without apparent aggression. A hierarchical interspecific dominance was very distinguishable with our experimental design. We suggest that the habitat segregation pattern observed in the field results, probably, from interspecific interaction. Behaviour Vol. 120 (1992) pp. 51-68 CACHING BEHAVIOUR IN THE GRAY JAY AND THE SOURCE-DEPARTURE DECISION FOR RATE-MAXIMIZING SCATTERHOARDERS THOMAS A. WAITE Department of Zoology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210-1293, U.S.A JOHN D. REEVE Department of Biological Science, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL 32306, U.S.A. We developed a model that concerns, in part, how long a scatterhoarder should persist in caching food from an ephemeral, locally abundant source ('bonanza') before moving on in search of other sources. The model assumes that an animal scattering food caches for later use behaves in a manner that maximizes the rate at which it stores recoverable (surviving) food in its habitat. It is shown theoretically that under some conditions it is better not to cache all available food but instead to move on in search of other food sources. This 'source-departure decision' for scatterhoarders is analogous to the patch-departure decision for animals that forage among food patches. It is shown that whether, and at what point, a 'moving-on threshold' is reached should depend on the size of the source, the strength of density-dependent cache theft, and the abundance of sources in the habitat. A field experiment was performed to test the qualitative prediction that gray jays, Perisoreus canadensis, should not persist as long in caching food when a day- long opportunity for caching is restricted to a single source (single-source treatment) as when such an opportunity is divided among a series of disjunct sources (multiple-source treatment). In the single-source treatment, jays tended to cache at lower overall rates, transport food items to more distant cache sites, and spend less time caching. These tendencies became more pronounced later in the day. However, although the rate of caching approached zero in the single-source treatment, the jays did not completely cease caching. This apparent violation of the model is attributed to the behaviour of recaching, a facet of gray jay scatterhoarding behaviour that was not built into the model. This retrieval and redistribution of previous caches resulted in the stabilization of the density of caches near the source. In addition, this switch from single- to multiple-load caching trips arguably would make it economical for gray jays to continue to make caching trips from a source beyond the source-departure point predicted by the model. Our theoretical and empirical results begin to show how scatterhoarders may behave in a manner that maximizes the long-term average rate of storage of recoverable food energy throughout their habitat.</page><page sequence="259">VOLUME 120 901 Behaviour Vol. 120 (1992) pp. 69-89 FORAGING STRATEGIES OF AMERICAN WHITE PELICANS BLAIR F. McMAHON and ROGER M. EVANS Department of Zoology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, R3T 2N2 Foraging strategies employed by American white pelicans were studied at a riverine site in Manitoba, Canada, during the breeding season in 1985 and 1986. Six strategies were identified during both diurnal and nocturnal foraging periods. Sit-and-wait was the least common strategy (four instances). Mobile individuals were common but had low rates of bill dipping and prey capture, as did relatively rare and uncoordinated aggregations. A degree of flock coordination occurred in following flocks, characterized by foragers following one after the other, with occasional synchronization of bill dipping among flock members. The largest number of pelicans foraged within more or less circular groups called nuclei. Synchronous bill dipping and apparent herding of prey towards shore were common within nuclei. The most highly coordinated strategy, semicircles, involved small numbers of foragers (2 to 30 birds) that maintained their positions relative to one another, usually in a semicircle but sometimes moving to a closed circular pattern. The greatest degree of synchronized bill dipping occurred in semicircles. Small inter-bird distances and synchronized bill dipping in nuclei and semicircles may enhance their effectiveness in driving or herding clumped fish prey. Foraging strategies could be arranged along a continuum based on degree of coordination, ranging from mobile individuals, then uncoordinated aggregations, through increasing degrees of coordination in fol- lowing, nuclei, and semicircles. Along this continuum, prey size and capture rats were greatest for the more highly coordinated strategies, while less coordinated strategies appeared to be involved primarily in searching. Switching among strategies fit along the same continuum, with a tendency to switch from less to more coordinated strategies when prey were located and to return to less coordinated search when cap- ture rates declined. Video analysis of captures within large nuclei and observations of positional shifts among foragers in nuclei and following flocks indicated that all individuals within a coordinated group potentially benefited from the presence of others, supporting the view that coordinated foraging strategies in this species are examples of true cooperative foraging. The range of strategies, and interplay among them, appear to provide the American white pelican with a highly effective group foraging system for harvesting mobile, clumped fish prey. Behaviour Vol. 120 (1992) pp. 90-102 BEHAVIORAL INFORMATION PROVIDED BY TWO SONG FORMS OF THE EASTERN KINGBIRD, T. TYRANNUS W. JOHN SMITH and ANNE MARIE SMITH Department of Biology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104-6018, USA Eastern kingbirds facilitate prediction of their social behavior through the proportional use of two different song forms, zeer and chatter-zeer, in daytime singing performances. The chatter-zeer song form predicts approach to closer quarters, whereas zeer predicts a high probability of staying put. The correlations of each song form with behavior were determined by observing natural encounters singers had with their mates, conspecific intruders and birds of other species. Playback simulations of territorial intrusions were then used to test whether singers would approach with a high proportion of chatter-zeer and little or no zeer. This was strongly confirmed. Kingbirds who approach are taking a major interactional initiative, even though their next move is usually to await the other individual's response. In effect, singers dare or encourage those individuals to interact. The chatter-zeer with which they precede or announce approach does not specify the kind of interaction for which singers are prepared: the information it provides is as relevant in events in which the singer associates with its mate as in events in which the singer confronts an opponent. A zeer singer is less actively provocative, deferring initiative more while nonetheless being ready to respond to the actions of others. By providing information about the relative probabilities of these actions, singing should help kingbirds to negotiate or even arrange social issues while spatially separated, often obviating closer encounters. Since many kinds of animals sing, and since the characteristic continuity and cadencing of singing performances are specializations well suited to communicating at a distance, it is worth asking if other species also use singing patterns and songs to distinguish between the actions of holding back and approaching.</page><page sequence="260">902 VOLUME 120 Behaviour Vol. 120 (1992) pp. 103-122 MOTHER-OFFSPRING SEPARATION AND ACOUSTIC STEREOTYPY: A COMPARISON OF CALL MORPHOLOGY IN TWO SPECIES OF PINNIPEDS STEPHEN J. INSLEY Department of Biology, University of Victoria, Victoria, B.C., Canada I have compared structural variation of the primary vocalizations used between mother-offspring pairs in two species of pinnipeds that differ fundamentally in their breeding behaviour: northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris) mothers and offspring normally are together throughout the nursing period; northern fur seal (Callorhinus ursinus) females regularly separate from their offspring while nursing. Two predictions were tested: (1) these vocalizations should be individually-distinct (stereotyped) in females and pups of both species if they serve to function for recognition, and (2) because individuality should be more pronounced in a species where separations and reunions are common, the vocalizations used between northern fur seal mother-offspring pairs should be more individually-stereotyped than those of the northern elephant seal. Principal components analyses revealed structural differences between the calls of females and pups in both species. Analysis of variance showed the calls of individual seals to be acoustically distinct in all cases. The calls used between mother-offspring pairs of northern fur seals were more stereotyped than those of northern elephant seals. These calls had less within-individual variation, greater among-individual variation and were more often correctly predicted in discriminant analyses. The results indicate that selective pressure to develop vocal recognition exists in both species but is greater in the northern fur seal. Behaviour Vol. 120 (1992) pp. 123-138 THE EFFECTS OF A TRADE-OFF BETWEEN FORAGING AND BROOD DEFENSE ON PARENTAL BEHAVIOUR IN THE CONVICT CICHLID FISH, CICHLASOMA NIGROFASCIATUM ROBERT W. RANGELEY and JEAN-GUY J. GODIN Department of Biology, Mount Allison University, Sackville, NB, Canada EOA 3CO Parental convict cichlids, Cichlasoma nigrofasciatum, responded to the presence of a potential brood predator by decreasing net energy gains (food intake decreased and energy expenditure increased) while increasing parental effort (large allocation of time to brood defense). These behaviours are important factors in the life-history trade-off between current and future reproductive investments. The allocation of energy into defense behaviours and elevated activity levels, combined with a voluntary reduction of food consumption, represent an investment in the current brood which could (in nature) reduce future reproduction. Contrary to parental investment theory predictions, consistent increases in parental effort with brood age were not evident. Behaviour Vol. 120 (1992) pp. 139-150 INDIVIDUAL RECOGNITION OF NESTLING DISTRESS SCREAMS BY EUROPEAN STARLINGS (STURNUS VULGARIS) MARTHALEAH CHAIKEN Institute of Animal Behavior, Rutgers University, 101 Warren Street, Newark, New Jersey 07102, U.S.A. Individual recognition of nestling distress screams by European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) was assessed by comparing the responses of free-living parents to playbacks of screams recorded from their own young or from neighbouring chicks. Individual variation in the acoustic structure of distress screams was analysed to assess whether they were likely to afford an acoustic basis for individual recognition. Parents hearing screams of their own young were significantly more likely to make diving attacks on the speaker than parents hearing the screams of neighbouring chicks. Thus nestling screams appear to function as individually indentifiable calls for aid. Multivariate analysis of variance employing 9 acoustic parameters of nestling screams revealed significant differences among groups of screams recorded from different chicks, suggesting that screams could afford a suitable basis for individual recognition. Post-hoc F-tests suggest that the period and extent of rapid frequently modulations would provide the best cues to the identity of the caller.</page><page sequence="261">VOLUME 120 903 Behaviour Vol. 120 (1992) pp. 151-163 PERCEPTION OF DISTRESS CALL HARMONIC STRUCTURE BY THE STARLING (STURNUS VULGARIS) T. AUBIN and J.C. BREMOND Laboratoire d'ethologie experimentale, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, St. Lucien, F-28210, France To examine the ethological role of signal composition in the distress calls of starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), we conducted a series of playback experiments in the field. Earlier researches revealed that frequency modulations are important features of distress calls for triggering the responses of starlings. Another feature, the harmonic structure, was thought to play a role in the coding/decoding process of the call. The aim of this work was to investigate the role of this structure. Four points emerge from these experiments: 1) Ethological message is effectively encoded in the harmonic structure. 2) Wide-band frequency spectra are preferred to narrow-band spectra. 3) Starlings examine the width of the spectrum but not the interval between frequency bands. 4) Spectra with a high intensity upper part produce a stronger response than other types of spectra. Such a coding/decoding process is discussed regarding transmission of information at long range, the ability to appreciate distance, to locate the caller and the possibility of grading the information. Behaviour Vol. 120 (1992) pp. 164-176 SEXUAL SELECTION IN THE LEOPARD TOAD, BUFO PARDALIS MICHAEL I. CHERRY Department of Zoology, South Parks Road, Oxford OXI 3PS, England Sexual selection was investigated in the leopard toad, Bufo pardalis, on the Cape Peninsula in the south- western Cape Province of South Africa. Over three breeding seasons, male mating success was not dependent on either snout-urostyle length (size) or weight, when data were analysed on both a nightly and a seasonal basis. Males did not engage in active searching for females, or attempt to displace other males in amplexus. This is most unusual for an explosive breeder, in which spawning takes place at a specific site. It is suggested that the absence of patterns of behaviour normally adaptive for explosive breeders may be associated with the fact that a congeneric species with a different chromosome number, B. rangeri, overlaps in both distribution and breeding season with B. pardalis over part of its range. Active searching might therefore lead to males finding a mate of the wrong species, which would be maladaptive, as no male was successful in obtaining more than one mating over the three-year study period. Alternatively, the absence of scramble competition in this species may reflect predation pressure. Behaviour Vol. 120 (1992) pp. 177-191 SOCIAL DISPERSION AND LEKKING IN UGANDA KOB ANDREW BALMFORD Large Animal Research Group, Department of Zoology, Downing Street, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, UK Lek-breeding in Uganda kob was associated with extremely high population density (c. 140 animals/kin2). Kob were typically found in unstable aggregations of more than one hundred animals, including several adult males. Females occupied unusually large, overlapping home ranges, but reasons for such widespread movements were unclear. The social dispersion of Uganda kob was therefore similar to that of other lekking ungulates, and confirms predictions of several recent hypotheses of lek evolution. However, resolution of alternative models is nevertheless difficult, since in practice these make very few exclusive predictions.

Analysis of sexual behaviour included 121.7 h of observation of 19 focal females. In addition, ad libitum recorded male agonistic interactions, occurring in the vicinity of the focal females, were analyzed. Both sexes initiated sexual associations, and females were found almost always in contact (within 2 m) with a male. Most matings took place within 1 min after contact establishment, and the proportion of these quick matings was especially high for subadult males, which mainly "sneaked" copulations during moments of distraction of adult males. Mating contacts were longer than non-mating contacts, and varied in duration from a few seconds to more than 2 hours. Mating contacts with adult males did not differ in length with respect of the initiating sex. Females were considerably more active in terminating than initiating contacts. Females mated, on average, once every 30 min, and had 1-10 different partners (out of 37 sexually mature males) during a 4 h observation session. Females mated with 40-100% of their contact partners. An absence of mating with specific males was due to interference by other males, improper timing of contact, or (temporary) lack of attractivity of the female rather than related with a rejection of these males in almost all cases. Similarly, a highly significant positive correlation between mating frequency of a male and time spent in the vicinity of the focal females revealed that females did not discriminate among potential mates, and, hence, did not exercise mate choice. The majority of matings (71%) were accumulated by 7 out of the 9 oldest males and additionally 2 young adults. One indicator for sexual competition among males was the peak of male injuries during the mating season. Aggressive interactions between adult and subadult males, indicating a clear-cut dominance of the adults, occurred frequently, while dyadic agonistic interactions between adult males were rare and inconsistent. The available data indicated age-inversed rank relations and were not predictive for mating success. A highly significant positive correlation was, however, found between male mating success and the participation as ally in polyadic agonistic interactions. The oldest males gave and received most support and were rarely victims of coalitions while the reverse was found for young adult males. All males followed an "age rule", after which the older of 2 males was supported during a conflict. Consequently, male power asymmetry in polyadic conflicts ran counter that in dyadic situations, and could change quickly depending on the presence of potential allies. Chances for dyadic solutions of conflicts were rare on the ground where most estrous females and the old males spent their time. Although females did not reject potential mates, they nevertheless influenced male mating success by inciting male competition. Females often tried to contact a new partner after a mating, thereby actively putting both males into conflict. The creation of such encounters was possible only between males with low power asymmetry, and only males which got successfully through these frequent female-initiated tests of their power had a high mating success. Incitation of male competition was discussed as a female mating tactic in species with a high sexual dimorphism. Compared with other macaques, the Barbary macaque belongs to such species.

FUSCATA) MACAQUES, THEIR NORMALLY-RAISED OFFSPRING, AND OFFSPRING CROSS-FOSTERED BETWEEN SPECIES MICHAEL J. OWREN, JACQUELYN A. DIETER, ROBERT M. SEYFARTH and DOROTHY L. CHENEY Department of Psychology, University of Pennsylvania, and California Primate Research Center, University of California, Davis We tested a recent claim that rhesus and Japanese macaque offspring cross-fostered between species exhibit vocal learning by producing 'food' calls typical of their adoptive rather than their genetic species (MASATAKA &amp; FUJITA, 1989). Our study population consisted of four groups of socially-reared animals housed outdoors - two of each species. Food calls produced by adult female rhesus and Japanese macaques did not differ at the species level, although individual differences were clearly present. Food calls produced by normally raised offspring differed both between individuals and between species. In spite of statistically significant differences, however, immatures in the two species still showed substantial overlap on every acoustic feature that was measured. Evidence from four cross-fostered offspring was equivocal. Two rhesus macaques raised in Japanese macaque social groups produced calls that were typical of their own species. Some measurements from calls produced by two cross-fostered Japanese macaques fell closer to mean values for normal rhesus than for those of their own species. However, these measurements were still within the observed range of variation shown by normally raised Japanese macaques. We conclude that food calling behavior of cross-fostered Japanese macaques may have shown modification, but that any such effect was not based on a species-specific adult model. Given the variability of these sounds and the lack of species differences</page><page sequence="263">VOLUME 120 905 in adult female vocalizations, food calls do not present a good opportunity to test for vocal learning in cross-fostered rhesus and Japanese macaques.

HASSENSTEIN, Universitat Freiburg, 7800 Freiburg, Germany In wetting children (functional enuresis nocturna and diurna) days and nights with perfect bladder control alternate with wet days and nights. Changes of behavioural regulation are responsible for the temporary disfunction of bladder control when awake or asleep. By means of long-term behaviour observations of wetting children in their families and in kindergarten we succeeded in isolating different forms of wetting. Wetting during zealous play, referred to as enuresis diuma type A, occurs when the bladder is filled during an intensive play activity. Wetting due to conflict (enuresis diurna type B) as well as nighttime wetting (enuresis noctuma) occur independently of the filling of the bladder, but directly depending on preceding stressful events. Step by step the information from the behaviour observations are incorporated into the functional diagram of the regulation of micturition until the elements of the faulty regulation in functional enuresis can be demonstrated. In the wetting child the need for loving attention has become the signal for the micturition. This learned association is the pathological part within the behaviour regulation. Functional enuresis is an example for a modification of biologically adaptive behaviourial elements by unfavourable environmental conditions. Behaviour Vol. 120 (1992) pp. 262-283 MONOGAMY IN THE EUROPEAN STARLING JONATHAN WRIGHT and INNES CUTHILL Edward Grey Institute, Department of Zoology, South Parks Road, Oxford OXI 3PS, U.K. Recent theoretical and experimental studies appear to provide a comprehensive explanation for the evolu- tionary, and short-term, stability of biparental care in birds. However, much of the intraspecific variation in the absolute and relative contribution by the male and female remains to be explained. Most studies of the natural variation across pairs reveal positive correlations between the level of male and female nest defence or brood provisioning, but some species show negative relations, or between-season variability in the direction of the relationship. This study examines the determinants of male and female provision- ing rate in monogamous European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), in terms of the patterns of male display, pairing patterns, laying phenology and clutch attributes. There was assortative pairing by body size and, controlling for female body size, larger males attracted relatively fecund mates. Males that sang rela- tively more, controlling for these body size effects, were paired with females that laid earlier. Female nest provisioning rates to experimentally standardized broods were positively correlated with female size, but male provisioning rates were unrelated to either song or any other attributes of themselves or their mates.

The frequency distribution for interindividual variation in the proportion of time spent moving was bimodal, but distributions for the other movement parameters were not. Thus, in the field, young charr tended to specialize at one of two alternative movement patterns differing primarily in the pro- portion of time spent moving. The movement parameters were all positively correlated, but correlations</page><page sequence="264">906 VOLUME 120 between the proportion of time spent moving, the speed while moving, and pursuit distance were small enough (r2 s &amp;lt; 0.30) to suggest that different aspects of search mode may vary relatively independently. Our findings have three implications for studies of search mode. First, intraspecific variation in search mode need not be only a response to environmental change, but can occur in the same environment at the same time. Second, frequency distributions of movement parameters offer a more objective base than do arbitrary classifications for determining how many types of foragers are present. Third, studies using different movement parameters to distinguish between alternative search modes (e.g. sitting-and-waiting and actively searching) may not be directly comparable.

MACCHARLES Department of Psychology, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John's Newfoundland AIB 3X9, Canada JULIE M. PORTER Fisheries and Oceans, Biological Station, St. Andrews, New Brunswick, EOG 2X0, Canada Black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) appear to recognize their chicks later in development than do ground-nesting gulls, an observation which has been related to the lower mobility of the chicks in nests on narrow cliff ledges. We tested whether this apparent delayed recognition was due to a failure of chicks to identify themselves (few individual cues in calls), or a failure of either participant to discriminate its relatives (differential response to calls or visual characteristics). It appears that both processes are relevant: (a) the peep calls of kittwake chicks have fewer identifying cues in them than the peep calls from chicks of the ground-nesting herring gull (Larus argentatus), and (b) both parents and chicks show low levels of responsiveness to kittiwake calls from their own or from other nests. These results are discussed in terms of the appropriate level of responsiveness in the cliff environment, and the adaptive significance of the presence or absence of strong positive responses to one's own family members.</page><page sequence="265">VOLUME 121 907 Behaviour Vol. 121 (1992) pp. 1-19 COURTSHIP BEHAVIOR OF THE SMALL-MOUTHED SALAMANDER (AMBYSTOMA TEXANUM): THE EFFECTS OF CONSPECIFIC MALES ON MALE MATING TACTICS SCOTT R. McWILLIAMS Animal Ecology Department, Iowa State University, Ames, IA 50011, U.S.A. 1. The courtship behavior of A. texanum consisted of a rapid nudging period followed by males producing many spermatophores, some of which were picked up by the female. Neither amplexus or leading by the male were integral components of courtship. Consequently, proposed geographic variation in A. texanum courtship remains unsubstantiated. 2. Courtship behavior of A. texanum and A. barbouri (formerly pond and stream form A. texanum, respectively) is very similar; only the location of courtship and perhaps the frequency of sexual interference tactics are different for these two sibling species. 3. A. texanum courtship is rapid, males produce large numbers of spermatophores per courtship and invest little courtship time per spermatophore, and intermale competition is extreme. 4. Male A. texanum promote their sexual success using sexual interference behavior (e.g. covering other spermatophores with their own) and to a lesser degree sexual defense behavior (e.g. forcefully nudging rival males). 5. Male sexual success is primarily enhanced directly - A. texanum males increase the number of spermatophores produced when at least two other males are courting the same female. The temporal allocation of these additional spermatophores is adaptive only if males are maximizing the number of ejaculates per female or breeding typically occurs in polygamous aggregations.

This work exploited the relationship between variability in contest outcomes and fighting behavioural sequences as a function of different types of encounters. In addition, the effects of resident orientation, duration of resident occupancy (acclimatization) and initial distance of the intruder anterior end from the resident (head or tail) were all included. The eviction frequency was significantly greater in the presence of acclimated individuals. Acclimatization reduced chances of cohabitation between two individuals within the same burrow. However, the importance of the acclimatization was greater in head to head ("H-H") encounters as opposed to head to tail ("H-T") encounters. Encounters within a 15 cm distance separating each individuals showed that intruders were expelled in all "H-H" cases (100%) in contrast to 32% in "H-T" encounters. No significant difference was noticed between "H-H" and "H-T" encounters where the initial distance was greater than 15 cm. Fights were settled, on average, in 10 minutes with acclimated individuals in contrast to less than 2 minutes with non-acclimated worms. Behavioural sequences, for agonistic encounters, were more complex in residents than for intruders. Complexity in patterns was also greater for non-acclimated worms.</page><page sequence="266">908 VOLUME 121 Behaviour Vol. 121 (1992) pp. 35-60 INFORMATION STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND THE FREQUENTIAL METHOD OF DATA COLLECTING: DESCRIPTION AND ILLUSTRATION OF A NEW MODEL IN THE STUDY OF ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR B.A. ELLENBROEK, B. HOEKS and A.R. COOLS University of Nijmegen, Psychoneuropharmacological Research Unit, P.O. Box 9101, 6500 HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands In the past information statistical analyses have been used for the description of the temporal organization of behaviour. In general, these analyses are based upon data collected with the sequential method. This method is known to limit the general applicability of information statistical analyses. In the present report a new model, based upon data collected with the frequential method, is presented. In this model too it is assumed that animals behave according to a MARKOV process. In the present model, however, the assumption of a MARKOV process implies that information (entropy) of a certain behaviour is a function of time, and not a function of "order in time". The key-advantage of this analysis is that it can be assessed to data collected during relatively short lasting observation sessions; using a computerized time recording system with a resolution of 0.1 s, for instance, a 60 min. session provides 36000 sampling points, viz. sufficient data for filling completely a transition matrix. This, in turn, implies that the analysis allows the calculation of the maximum error of the entropy (information) using a purely analytical method. Due to the ideal combination of a high sampling frequency and a relatively short collecting time, this analysis can be used to describe the individual relationships within social group structures in great detail. In the present report the applicability of this analysis is illustrated by assessing it to a single set of data collected in a study o spontaneously occurring changes in a group of 4 Java monkeys (Macacafascicularis). The analysis deals with data collected in 17 sessions, one hour each, and recorded on separate days, the new analysis provided a detailed and quantitative description of dynamic changes, which could not be detected with the classical frequency analysis. The new analysis also provided a new dimension to the description of dynamic changes which were detected with the frequency analysis.

It has also been hypothesized that the males of a clan are genetically related. In this paper a causal approach is adopted in order to investigate the proximate factors which can account for the structure/dynamics of socio-spatial group organization observed over two years in a large colony of hamadryas and hybrid baboons housed in an outdoor enclosure in the Madrid Zoo, containing 18 adult males with known kin relations. I first examined the types of grouping observed in the colony and the alternative social strategies used by the different male individuals during their ontogenetic trajectories for acquiring, and maintaining, females. Since the hamadryas baboon is considered a female-transfer species, I studied whether the sex that stays, that is, the males, developed some kind of mutual affiliative relationship, as one would predict, and whether their inter-male bonding preferences were based on genetic relatedness or on familiarity (i.e. sharing the same development environment during socialization).</page><page sequence="267">VOLUME 121 909 Behaviour Vol. 121 (1992) pp. 95-109 OPITIMAL FORAGING IN PEROMYSCUS POLIONOTUS: THE INFLUENCE OF ITEM-SIZE AND PREDATION RISK JOHN P. PHELAN and RICHARD H. BAKER Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA Predictions of optimal foraging theory were tested for Peromyscus polionotus in the laboratory and in two field experiments in which seed item-size was manipulated. In the laboratory, handling times for millet, sunflower seeds, and peanuts were determined. Additionally, energy/handling (E/h) time values were calculated and seed preference experiments were conducted. Mice showed a clear preference for the seeds more profitable in terms of E/h. Seed preference experiments were also conducted in the field to determine the relative influence of optimal foraging and predation risk in diet choice. In the first of the two field experiments, behavioral strategies to reduce predation vulnerability could not influence differential seed selection. As predicted, the mice again showed a preference for the more profitable seed type. In the second experiment, animals were presented with conflicting demands because foraging on a more abundant, but less preferred, seed type afforded the animal an increased ability to avoid predators. Presented with this opportunity to reduce the risk of predation, the animals shifted their preference to the safer, but less profitable food. This shift in seed preference was accompanied by predation-risk-reducing changes in spatial foraging patterns.

KOENIG Museum of Vertebrate Zoology and Hastings Reservation, University of California, Star Route Box 80, Carmel Valley, CA 93924, USA Yellow-billed magpies breed in loose colonies. Extra-pair courtship is frequent, and a comparison (1) be- tween two adjacent areas with different inter-nest distances, and (2) with solitary, territorial European black-billed magpies, indicates that either an aggregated distribution of nests, or a relatively loose territo- rial system in yellow-billed magpies increases opportunities for extra-pair behaviour. Male yellow-billed magpies guard their partner closely following them from five days before the first egg is laid. Pair copu- lations were infrequent, occurring 3 or 4 times per clutch, and mainly over days -5 to -3. Territoriality, which is most pronounced during the female's fertile period, may enable the male to guard his partner while simultaneously foraging to provide her with food.

Functional hypotheses are described and tested with the available data. The song bouts of mated females are shown to be strongly associated with the pressure of territorial defence. Conversely, the solo song bouts of mated males show no relationship with territorial behaviour, but are associated with the (estimated) density of</page><page sequence="268">910 VOLUME 121 floating unmated males in the population. In accordance with the hypotheses under test, these results indicate that mated females sing to defend their territories, whilst mated males sing to repel males in defence of their mate and offspring. Contrary to previous hypotheses, the production of coordinated duets by male and female pairs is found to be unrelated to pairbonding. However, duetting is shown to be associated with encounters and aggression at the territorial boundary, in support of the claim that duetting advertises pairbond presence in order to intimidate neighbours and reduce the costs of territorial conflicts. The implications of these analyses for territorial and mating strategies in gibbons are discussed.

U.R.A. 373 Universite de Rennes, 35042 Rennes Cedex, France By stimulating female common domesticated canaries with computer edited song stimuli, we investigated the salience of own breed phonology or song segmentation. These own breed acoustic parameters versus alien breed's and heterospecific ones were tested using copulation solicitation displays as an index of female responses. We found that females gain information about their own breed identity from both phonology and song segmentation. Border strain syllables or segmentation ensure high levels of responses, similar to those elicited by own breed ones. By contrast, harzer strain, wild canary and greenfinch phonology or segmentation elicited low levels of displays. The weaker reactions were recorded to harzer phonology. Processes involved in female recognition of multipartite songs are discussed and compared to those used by male oscines.

WILSON University of Edinburgh, Institute of Cell, Animal and Population Biology, Zoology Building, West Mains Road, Edinburgh, EH9 3JT, U.K. This study examined physical and social correlates of agonistic display performance by wild great tits Parus major competing over food and territorial space. All behavioural data were collected at winter feeding stations from individually colour-ringed birds for which data on physical characteristics, current social status and individual history were available. At feeders, competitive interactions between males were more frequent than those involving females, and birds not present in previous winters (mostly first- winter birds) interacted more frequently than prior residents (locally territorial adults). Interactions away from food sources usually involved at least one male, increased in frequency over the course of the winter, and often involved chasing of one bird by another. These interactions are thought to reflect competition for territorial space. Males were almost always dominant over females in competitive interactions. Simple supplants were most frequent in intersexual interactions, with display being more often seen in interactions between birds of the same sex. In intrasexual interactions, there were no consistent differences between the sexes in frequency of use of displays, but there was a general trend for postural display elements to be performed more often by eventual dominants than by eventual subordinates. Displays based on 'head-up' tended to be performed by prior resident, locally dominant, territorial males. Their incidence increased over the course of the winter, and they were especially associated with non- feeder interactions. Displays based on 'wings-out' and 'tail-fanning' were associated with non-territorial, first-year birds that were less frequently occurring at the study site, and tended to occur in cases where the opponents had little prior experience of each other. Displays based on head up were performed almost exclusively in intraspecific interactions, whereas those based on wings out and tail fanning were also common in contests over food with blue P caeruleus and coal tits P. ater, in which the great tit was usually dominant.</page><page sequence="269">VOLUME 121 Behaviour Vol. 121 (1992) pp. 215-230 THE DEVELOPMENT OF A BEHAVIOR SYSTEM: DUSTBATHING IN THE BURMESE RED JUNGLEFOWL. III. EFFECTS OF EXPERIENCE ON STIMULUS PREFERENCE KLAUS VESTERGAARD and JERRY A. HOGAN Department of Psychology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada M5S 1Al Two experiments were designed to study the development of the perceptual mechanism that recognizes dust. We examined the effects of early experience with a variety of substrates on the choice of a substrate for dustbathing. In the first experiment, chicks were given experience with one substrate: black or white sand or a skin of junglefowl feathers. In a choice test, there was an overwhelming preference for the black sand both as a dustbathing and a pecking substrate, regardless of early experience. Nonetheless, some of the birds exposed to white sand or feathers as the training stimulus did become entrained to dustbathe on these substrates. In the second experiment, chicks were given equal experience with each of four substrates: white, normal, and dark sand, and sawdust. In the choice tests, the birds dustbathed in the substrates in the same proportion that they dustbathed during training when only one stimulus was available at a time. The birds preferred to dustbathe in the normal sand, but preferred to peck at sawdust. The experiments show that both the stimulus properties of a substrate and the kind of experience a bird has dustbathing in a substrate determinate whether a bird develops a tendency to find that substrate suitable for dustbathing. Behaviour Vol. 121 (1992) pp. 231-258 THE REPRODUCTIVE BEHAVIOUR OF a-, 3-, AND y-MALE MORPHS IN PARACERCEIS SCULPTA, A MARINE ISOPOD CRUSTACEAN STEPHEN M. SHUSTER Department of Zoology, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720, U.S.A. Males occur as three distinct morphotypes in Paracerceis sculpta, a marine isopod inhabiting the Gulf of California. Alpha-males are largest in body size (x SD = 6.55 ± 0.72 mm, N = 63) and defend breeding sites in intertidal sponges. Beta-males are smaller (x ± SD = 4.34 ± 0.43 mm, N = 59) and resemble sexually receptive females in behaviour and body form. Gamma-males are tiny (x±SD = 2.65 ±0.73 mm, N = 23) and are capable of rapid movements. All three male morphs are sexually mature and successfully sire young in the field (SHUSTER, 1989a). Using artificial sponges to simulate natural breeding habitats, I examined (a) competitive interactions among a-males for access to breeding sites and sexually receptive females, (b) behaviours used by 3- and 'y-males to enter spongocoels, and (c) the tendency for 3- and -y-males to discriminate breeding site quality in terms of the availability of sexually receptive females. I found that: 1. Resident and intruder a-males used their walking legs, uropods and body positioning to retain or gain access to breeding sites. 2. Intruders were consistently more aggressive than residents in contests, except when breeding sites containing sexually receptive females were limited. 3. Despite their relative quiescence, residents retained their spongocoels in most contests, apparently due to the positional advantage residents gain when situated in the spongocoel. 4. When interacting with a-males, /3-males imitated female courtship behaviour, and a-males responded as if /3-males were females. Tactile stimulation of a-males by /-males may thus be sufficient to release normal a-male courtship behaviour. 5. Beta-males preferred spongocoels containing a-males paired to sexually receptive females, over spon- gocoels containing a-males paired to gravid (nonreceptive) females. 6. Beta-males also preferred spongocoels containing high densities of receptive females over spongocoels containing low densities of receptive females. 7. However, /3-males preferred to associate with unpaired a-males over a-males paired to gravid females. Since receptive females prefer established breeding sites (SHUSTER, 1990), this preference by /-males remains unexplained. 8. Gamma-males approached breeding sites occupied by a-males indirectly, and invaded spongocoels only after repeated attempts to slip around the resident a-male and into his spongocoel. 9. Alpha-males actively resisted such invasion attempts, and with considerable dexterity, used their uropods, the apex of their pleotelsons and their walking legs to evict y-male intruders. Small body size may enhance a --male's ability to remain within breeding sites. 911</page><page sequence="270">912 VOLUME 121 10. Unlike 3-males, -y-males preferred only spongocoels containing a-males paired to sexually receptive females, and showed no preference for unpaired a-males or oa-males paired to gravid females. Behaviour Vol. 121 (1992) pp. 259-287 SONG FEATURES ESSENTIAL FOR SPECIES DISCRIMINATION AND BEHAVIOUR ASSESSMENT BY MALE BLACKBIRDS (TURDUS MERULA) TORBEN DABELSTEEN Institute of Population Biology, Copenhagen University, Universitetsparken 15, DK-2100 Copenhagen 0, Denmark SIMON BOEL PEDERSEN Electronics Institute, Technical University, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark The present study tested the signal value of different parameters of the blackbird song by comparing territory owner's responses to unmodified motif parts. Parameters were modified with reference to their natural limits of variation which were known a priori for some of the parameters. Those for the frequency of occurrence of the three types of motif sound figures (unmodulated and/or complex toned FM-figures, and compound MIX-figures composed of pieces of both the CF- and the FM-type) and their modulations, and the relative sound pressure (SP) of their harmonics, were determined in this study. The following results were obtained: The frequency of occurrence of the sound figure types is essential for species discrimination in the sense that motif parts must contain CF-pieces with a relatively constant frequency (either as CF-figures or as parts of MIX-figures), and it communicates additional information: a high proportion of FM-figures giving a gurgling sound character communicates a high arousal and vice versa. The ratio of SP of the fundamental to that of the 1st and the 2nd overtone is also essential for species discrimination. The ratio must be greater than about 1:0.2:0.2 making the motif parts relatively pure toned. Above this value the SP ratio may communicate additional information: a relatively low ratio giving a hoarse sound character seems to represent a high arousal and vice versa. Also, a high sound pressure level of the motif parts communicates a high arousal and vice versa. Neither the order of sound figures, nor the specific variation across the motif part of the sound figures' frequency level, duration and amplitude is essential for species discrimination. So is, however, a certain variation per se of each of the three features across the motif part. The results fit in with the 'room for variation hypothesis' on the principles of coding information into bird song. Thus the species-essential parameters seem to be 'tuned' to their natural limits of variation in the sense that species discrimination ceases when they are changed beyond these limits; within these limits some of them convey additional behavioural information; and they include all sorts of parameters, e.g. basic as well as higher order syntactical and sound type parameters, and invariant as well as variable ones. Behaviour Vol. 121 (1992) pp. 288-315 FREQUENT COPULATIONS DESPITE LOW SPERM COMPETITION IN WHITE STORKS (CICONIA CICONIA) FRANCISKO S. TORTOSA Departamento de Biologia Animal, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de C6rdoba, E-14071 Cordoba, Spain TOMAS REDONDO Estacion Biologia de Dofiana, CSIC, Apdo. 1056, E-41080 Sevilla, Spain White Storks Ciconia ciconia paired for ca. 30 days before laying a clutch. During this period, mates copulated frequently (160 copulations/pair; 0.4 copulations/daylight h), but copulation rate was drastically reduced a week before laying of the eggs. Both fewer copulation attempts by males and lower female receptivity accounted for this reduction. This pattern was the same regardless of whether pairs nested solitarily or in colonies. Colonial as well as solitary males spent more time at the nest before egg-laying while the opposite trend was found for females. Consequently, females were more likely to remain alone at their nests while ovulating. Colonial birds had ample opportunities for engaging in extra-pair copulations (EPC) during the female fertile period, but these were very infrequent (0.4% of all successful copulations) and involved recently-paired birds exclusively. This suggests that sperm competition in this species is of</page><page sequence="271">VOLUME 121 913 little relevance for explaining patterns of pair copulations. Accordingly, males did not guard their female mate and the timing of copulation was poorly tuned to chances of fertilizing the female's eggs. However, it remains to be explained why storks copulated so much and for a prolonged period when the risk of EPC was so low. It is suggested that copulations may be part of a signalling system by which males advertise and females assess the physical condition of the male, which is likely to correlate with the ability of males to forage efficiently for them and their offspring. In support of this possibility, males who copulated frequently fed chicks at a higher rate during the nestling period.</page><page sequence="272">914 VOLUME 122 Behaviour Vol. 122 (1992) pp. 1-10 OBSERVATIONS ON NURSING BEHAVIOUR OF HOODED SEALS, CYSTOPHORA CRISTATA ELIZABETH A. PERRY Department of Psychology, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John's, Nfld. AIB 3X9, Canada GARRY B. STENSON Science Branch Department of Fisheries and Oceans, P.O. Box 5667, St. John's, Nfld. AIC 5X1, Canada This study reports the first quantitative data on nursing behaviour of hooded seals which have a four- day nursing period, the shortest known for any mammal. Twenty mother pup-pairs were observed at a whelping patch off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada during March, 1990. A total of 38 nursing sessions were recorded in 19 hours of observations. Pups nursed for an average duration of 5.5 min and at a frequency of approximately 2.4 bouts/hour. Morning and afternoon rates were similar (x = 2.5 bouts/hr and x = 2.4 bouts/hr, respectively) and nocturnal nursing was witnessed. Pups were nursing for 18% of the total observation time which, assuming no diurnal pattern, would total 4.3 hr per day, the highest daily nursing duration reported for any phosid. We concluded that hooded seal nursing behaviour is another important factor in the unique lactation strategy attributed to a particularly unstable environment. It helps to ensure that pups attain sufficient weaning mass, double their birth weights, in the four-day nursing period. Behaviour Vol. 122 (1992) pp. 11-25 THE ONTOGENY OF FOOD-STORING AND RETRIEVAL IN MARCH TITS N.S. CLAYTON E.G.I., Department of Zoology, Oxford University, Oxford OXI 3PS, U.K. March tits, Parus palustris, store food and rely on an accurate spatial memory to retrieve their caches. This study considers the ontogeny of storing and the spatial memory involved in retrieving these caches in juvenile hand-raised march tits. Preliminary work showed that these birds began storing and retrieving their caches around the time of feeding independence, suggesting that juveniles do not need to learn from adults. However, storing gradually improved over the first few trials, in terms of the appropriateness of items stored, the efficiency of choosing suitable storage sites and the rate of storing seeds. To answer the question of whether the behavioral improvement is a function of age, experience or both, the retrieval performance of two groups of birds were compared. During the first eight trials (24 days) after nutritional independence from the parents, the two groups were exposed to two different kinds of experience: experienced birds were provided with seeds which they could store and retrieve two hours later, whereas the naive birds were exposed only to the storage sites but they could not store. In the following eight trials, both groups were allowed to store and retrieve their caches. If the improvement was merely a consequence of age (maturation) no difference should be found between the two groups on trial 9. In contrast, if improvement was purely a function of experience then the pattern of improvement in the naive group should follow that of the experienced group, but showing an eight-trial time lag. The results suggested a pattern intermediate between these extremes, indicating that either the development of food-storing was a function of both age and experience or that other differences between the two groups, such as differences in motivation to store and/or experience at handling seeds, were important. In contrast, retrieval performance was better than expected by chance on the first trial it occurred and showed little, if any, improvement. Behaviour Vol. 122 (1992) pp. 26-40 MEMORY FOR THE SPATIAL POSITION OF AN IMPRINTING OBJECT IN JUNGLEFOWL CHICKS HENDRIK S. VAN KAMPEN and GERRIT J. DE VOS Zoological Laboratory, University of Groningen, P.O. Box 14, 9750 AA Haren, The Netherlands The characteristics of memory for the position of an imprinting object were investigated in junglefowl chicks (Gallus gallus spadiceus). Subjects were exposed individually and continuously to an imprinting object located in one of the two back quadrants of their home cage ('training quadrant'). Positioning of chicks in a test cage was studied from 7 to 11 days after hatching. In experiment 1 chicks preferred the training quadrant over the other back quadrant when tested in an empty cage, but not when two identical</page><page sequence="273">VOLUME 122 915 training objects were present, one in each back quadrant. In tests with one training object present, chicks showed more shrill calling when the object was in a novel position than when it was in the training position, but only during the first minute of a 5-min test. The strength of position preferences was independent of the effectiveness of the training object as an imprinting stimulus. In experiment 2a, chicks switched the position preference in an empty cage from the training quadrant to the other back quadrant after 2 h of exposure to the training object in that back quadrant of the home cage. In experiment 2b however, chicks still preferred the original training shape to a novel shape, after 2 h of exposure to an object with that novel shape. These results show that position memory in filial behaviour is less stable than memory for the physical properties of the imprinting object, and that position responses occur when chicks are motivated to seek contact with the object. Behaviour Vol. 122 (1992) pp. 41-55 SEXUAL IMPRINTING IN THE COLLARED DOVE (STREPTOPELIA DECAOCTO) CAREL TEN CATE, JOHN HILBERS and MIRIAM HALL Zoological Laboratory, University of Groningen, The Netherlands Although the occurrence of sexual imprinting has been demonstrated for doves, it is less well known how strong this effect is and which factors contribute to it. Therefore we examined whether cross- fostering collared doves (Streptopelia decaocto) to white ring doves (Streptopelia risoria) affected later mate preference and, also, whether the strength of this preference dependent on sex of the experimental birds, on the presence of siblings during rearing, on behaviour of the (foster)parents and on the behaviour of the stimulus birds during testing. Mate preferences were measured during choice tests using either stuffed or living stimulus birds, one of each species. The result showed (1) a strong effect of rearing species, but not of sex or presence of siblings on the later preference, (2) an overall bias towards preferring ring doves over conspecifics, both in tests using stuffed and tests using living stimulus birds, and (3) a tendency for the preference to shift towards collared doves with increasing are or testing experience. The findings indicate the occurrence of sexual imprinting in the collared dove and are compared with data on other species. The overall bias towards the ring dove was unexpected, but we suggest that this 'other species'. bias may result from the same mechanisms which are responsible for the occurrence of an 'own species bias' in a number of other species. Behaviour Vol. 122 (1992) pp. 56-77 SEAFINDING BY HATCHLING SEA TURTLES: ROLE OF BRIGHTNESS, SILHOUETTE AND BEACH SLOPE AS ORIENTATION CUES MICHAEL SALMON, JEANETTE WYNEKEN, ELIZABETH FRITZ and MARK LUCAS Department of Biological Sciences, Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, Florida 33431-0991, U.S.A. Upon emerging from underground nests, sea turtle hatchlings immediately crawl toward the ocean. The primary cues used in orientation are visual but the nature of the visual cues was a matter of speculation. Hatchlings might also respond to secondary cues, such as beach slope. Experiments were carried out in an arena where specific visual and slope cues, simulating those present at nest sites, could be precisely controlled and manipulated. Subjects were green turtle (Chelonia mydas L.) and loggerhead (Caretta caretta L.) hatchlings. Both species oriented toward the more intensely illuminated sections of the arena. They also oriented away from dark silhouettes which simulated an elevated horizon, typical of the view toward land. Turtles responded primarily to stimuli (both silhouettes and photic differences) at or near eye level. When presented simultaneously with a silhouette and a photic gradient located in different directions, hatchlings oriented away from the silhouette and ignored photic stimuli. Under infrared light, both species oriented down slopes. However in the presence of nocturnal levels of visible light loggerheads ignored slope cues and responses of green turtles to slope were weakened. The data suggest that loggerhead and green turtle hatchlings usually find the sea by orienting away from elevated silhouettes. This is a prominent and reliable cue for species which typically nest on continental heaches.</page><page sequence="274">916 VOLUME 122 Behaviour Vol. 122 (1992) pp. 78-87 POPULATION AND SEX DIFFERENCES IN COLOUR VISION IN THE EUROPEAN MINNOW PHOXINUS PHOXINUS (CYPRINIDAE) CATRIN HOFSTETTER and PAUL I. WARD Zoologisches Museum der Universitat Ziirich, Winterthurerstr. 190, 8057 Zurich, Switzerland The abilities of males and females from two populations of the European minnow Phoxinus phoxinus to discriminate between disks of different colours were compared. Fish were trained to feed at a disk lit with 'orange-yellow' light. Their ability to discriminate this training colour from others was then tested. Fish from a stream population were more accurate than those from a lake population and females more accurate than males. We cannot be completely sure the fish discriminated on colour rather than perceived brightness, though we tried to control for the latter. There were no significant differences in the times taken to perform the tests. We suggest the different visual environments in the two habitats have selected for different visual abilities. As males and females spend most of the year in shoals together, it is argued that the difference between males and females has evolved because of the females' need to discriminate between males' sexual displays during the breeding season. The results show that a fish's sex and perhaps its population of origin should be considered in tests of visual ability.

MANFRED SCHARTL Genzentrum, Max-Planck-Institut fur Biochemie, Am Klopferspitz 18a, D-8033 Martinsried, F.R.G. Pseudosexual behaviour is a rare phenomenon associated with unisexuality in vertebrates. In the gyno- genetic, all-female teleost Poecilia formosa, rare individuals occur that resemble males of closely related gonochoristic species both in behaviour and external morphology. These masculinized gynogens and nor- mal gynogens are members of the same clone, as demonstrated by DNA-fingerprinting. The behaviour of these masculinized gynogens is described and compared to the behaviour of the gonochoristic species Poecilia mexicana, P latipinna and their hybrid as well as androgen-treated individuals of P formosa. No statistically significant differences were found between masculinized gynogens and hormonetreated in- dividuals nor between the gonochoristic P. mexicana and P. latipinna males. Differences exist between gonochoristic and unisexual species. Possible causes and effects of masculinized gynogens are discussed. Behaviour Vol. 122 (1992) pp. 105-120 VARIABLE LEADERSHIP IN BAR-HEADED GEESE (ANSER INDICUS): AN ANALYSIS OF PAIR AND FAMILY DEPARTURES JURG LAMPRECHT Max-Planck-Institut fur Verhaltensphysiologie, D-8131 Seewiesen, Germany This paper reports quantitative leadership differences in semi-captive bar-headed geese (Anser indicus) at different times of the year, and in different types of groups. Leading is defined here as causing the departure or determining the direction of movement of the whole group. No permanent and exclusive leader of a pair or family group was found, rather relative leading frequencies of male, female and young showed a definite shifting pattern. Females led more often than their mates prior to breeding, and on nest pauses during the incubation period, but less often in summer, autumn and</page><page sequence="275">VOLUME 122 917 early winter. In families there was no difference between the frequencies of male and female leading. Family females led relatively more often than those of pairs without offspring. This difference was related to the presence, not the number, of young. Goslings led the family about as often as the parents during the rearing period in early summer, less often in autumn, winter and next spring. Such differences and changes are to be expected where competence in particular tasks and dependence on partners vary between group members, and where different situations require different abilities. For the geese, the results can be related to the different options of group members and to the different benefits they derive from leaving (or 'staying put') or following (or waiting for the others) in different situations. Behaviour Vol. 122 (1992) pp. 121-134 DENSITY DEPENDENT SONG DURATION IN THE GRASSHOPPER OMOCESTUS VIRIDULUS THORLEIFUR EIRIKSSON Department of Zoology, Stickholm University, S-106 91 Sweden Although duration of grashopper song is species specific, there is also considerable variation within species. One possible reason for this is that males are adjusting their singing tactics in relation to the density of competitors. Males are expected to sing shorter songs when other males are nearby to enhance the probability of hearing female response or to listen to other males. To test this hypothesis an experiment was performed by placing different numbers of Omocestus viridulus males in large outdoor cages and monitoring their singing behaviour. The results show that males sing on average shorter calling songs as the number of males increases. It was also found that males compensate for singing shorter songs by singing more songs, so the total time spent singing stays similar at all densities. The scenario is complicated by the singing of very short songs which are mainly, but not exclusively, used in male-male interactions. The probability that males sing rivalry songs increases with the density of males and the number of these songs increases as male-male interactions get longer. The results suggests that part of the variation in the duration of calling songs reported in several field studies is caused by a change in singing tactics at different densities of males. The function of rivalry songs is not clear. These songs may function in the spacing of males or may be an extremely short form of the normal calling song used when other males are very close. Behaviour Vol. 122 (1992) pp. 135-152 AGGRESSIVE MOTIVATION IN THE MIDAS CICHLID: EVIDENCE FOR BEHAVIORAL EFFERENCE ALAN B. BOND University of Nebraska State Museum, W436 Nebraska Hall, Lincoln, NE 68588-0514, U.S.A. Behavioral Efference is a hypothetical positive feedback from the performance of an aggressive display that augments the level of aggressive motivation. The hypothesis was proposed (BOND, 1989) to account for the occurrence of truthful communication during aggressive encounters, even in the face of a pre- sumed selective pressure in favor of deceit (MAYNARD SMITH, 1984). Evidence of Behavioral Efference was sought in an experimental study of adult Midas cichlids Cichlasoma citrinellum, in which subjects responded aggressively to varying sizes of dummy fish. Before and after each aggression trial, the level of aggressive motivation was estimated from the intensity of the subject's attacks on conspecific juve- niles. A weighted index of aggressiveness that objectively combined the frequencies of four aggressive action patterns was obtained using detrended correspondence analysis. Aggression indices from aggres- sion trials, as well as from intertrial intervals, furnished a basis for comparison of two causal models: behavioral efference, which assumes that post-stimulus motivation is substantially influenced by display performance, and Direct Stimulus Mediation, which assumes that the displays themselves play no imme- diate causal role. When the subjects actively displayed to the stimulus dummy, the results showed no significant correlation between the size of the dummy and the magnitude of the motivational effect. How- ever, a significant relationship was demonstrated between the level of aggressive display and subsequent increases in aggressive motivation, in precise accord with the Behavioral Efference model. Direct Stim- ulus Mediation was evident only in trials in which the subject displayed no overt aggression toward the stimulus object. An account of the functional significance of Behavioral Efference is provided, suggest- ing that the feedback serves to regulate the intensity of aggressive interactions by preparing the displaying individual for active combat.</page><page sequence="276">918 VOLUME 122 Behaviour Vol. 122 (1992) pp. 153-181 ESCAPE GAITS OF WHITE-TAILED DEER, MULE DEER AND THEIR HYBRIDS: GAITS OBSERVED AND PATTERNS OF LIMB COORDINATION SUSAN LINGLE Faculty of Environmental Design, University of Calgary, Alberta T2N 1N4 1. The escape gaits of white-tailed deer, mule deer and hybrid white-tailed x mule deer from Alberta were examined to investigate two hypotheses: 1) that the distinctive security patterns of white-tailed deer and mule deer underly their traditional habitat segregation, and 2) that interbreeding between white-tailed deer and mule deer results in disrupted security patterns for hybrid progeny. The first step is investigating these hypotheses, and the goals of this paper, were to identify gaits used by each type of deer and to compare characteristics of limb coordination in these strides. 2. High speed cinematography was used to record the fast escape gaits to captive white-tails, mule deer and hybrids. HILDEBRAND'S (1977) method for analyzing asymmetrical gaits were adapted to examine characteristics of limb coordination. 3. All groups galloped at times, but only white-tails galloped for escape when most alarmed. Mule deer stotted and Fl hybrids (with white-tail and with mule deer mothers) bounded when seemingly most alarmed. Gaits of Fl hybrids were similar among individuals. Although gaits of 3/4- and 7/8-mule deer were variable, these backcrosses largely failed to reproduce the specialized mule deer gaits. The consistency of white-tail, mule deer and Fl hybrid gaits indicates that these patterns have a strong genetic basis and could have evolved in response to different selective pressures. 4. Galloping white-tails tend to have two brief suspensions in their strides, whereas galloping mule deer tend to have prolonged suspension after the hind limb departure and more overlap between the hind and fore limbs. In part due to these characteristics, galloping white-tails attain faster speeds than galloping mule deer or hybrids. Hybrids are intermediate, but much more similar to mule deer. 5. Limb timing data were plotted on three-dimensions with the axes fore lead, hind lead and midtime lag to consider the range of strides employed by deer. Strides of the purebred gallops and mule deer stott fell into discrete regions of this figure, indicating these gaits are qualitatively distinct for contemporary white-tails and mule deer. Mule deer strides that were intermediate between the gallop and stott had large overlap between the fore and hind limbs (i.e. small midtime lag) relative to the amount of overlap between the right and left fore limb (i.e. fore lead), perhaps reflecting gait forms that were evolutionary transitions to the stott.

OSWALDO VASQUEZ Centro de Investigacciones della Biologia Marina, Universidad Autonoma de Santo Domingo, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic It has been hypothesized that humpback whale, Megaptera novaeangliae, competitive groups represent intrasexual competition by males for access to a mature female. The composition and dynamics of these groups was studied between 1989 and 1991 in Samana Bay, West Indies. The sex of group participants was determined by molecular analysis of skin biopsies. Groups showed similar characteristics of size and movement as those described from other breeding areas, except that only one group contained a call. The sex was determined of 141 participants in 44 competitive groups. In 21 of these groups, we were able to biopsy all participants. No group contained more than one female, but seven of the wholly sampled groups (all of them small) consisted entirely of males. Of 22 animals who were "positively" assigned the</page><page sequence="277">VOLUME 122 919 role of Nuclear Animal, 17 were female, and five were male. Similarly, of 24 biopsed Principal Escorts, 23 were male and one female. All 24 biopsied Challengers were male. Of 55 animals who were either classified as Secondary Escort, or whose role could not be categorized, 51 were male and four female. In 8 cases, associated pairs of males exhibiting no aggression towards each other were observed to either enter or leave a competitive group together. Of 16 individuals resighted on more than one day, all but one were males. These data suggest that: 1. While most groups (as predicted) represent male-male competition for a single female, observers should be cautious in their assumptions; 2. All-male groups may represent dominance sorting by unfamiliar conspecifics; 3. Females may occasionally aggressively repel advances by unwanted males; 4. While unlikely in light of present knowledge, the possibility that males form coalitions cannot be dismissed. We suggest that competitive groups may be asymmetrical contests in which a female Nuclear Animal is of more value to the Principal Escort than to a Challenger, particularly if the former's defense of her represents mate-guarding. Behaviour Vol. 122 (1992) pp. 195-230 AN EVALUATION OF AUDITORY LEARNING IN FILIAL IMPRINTING JOHAN J. BOLHUIS Department of Zoology, University of Cambridge, Downing Street, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England HENDRIK S. VAN KAMPEN Zoological Laboratory, University of Groningen, P.O. Box 14, 9750 AA Haren, The Netherlands The characteristics of auditory learning in filial imprinting in precocial birds are reviewed. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the addition of an auditory stimulus improves following of a visual stimulus. This paper evaluates whether there is genuine auditory imprinting, i.e. the formation of a preference for an auditory stimulus as a result of exposure to it. Many studies lack important features such as a balanced experimental design or a retention interval, which makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions from their results. The majority of studies of early auditory learning have used a compound of a visual and an auditory stimulus during training. Presentation of a visual object during auditory training improves learning about sounds. The visual stimulus may act as a US for learning about sounds. Alternatively, presentation of a visual stimulus may increase attention or arousal and thereby improve learning about the sound. In a large number of studies visual stimulation during auditory exposure was provided by the presence of a hen or siblings. Relatively few studies using only auditory exposure have demonstrated significant auditory learning. Exposure to a sound before hatching can lead to a significant preference for that sound when tested after hatching. However, such preferences are generally weak and short-lived. In a number of species, a predisposition for species-specific calls has been demonstrated, that is already apparent before hatching. It is concluded that auditory stimuli play an important role in the formation of filial preferences, but that auditory imprinting is not as prominent as has sometimes been suggested, especially when compared to visual imprinting.

MOORE Dalhousie University, Department of Psychology, Halifax, N.S. Canada B3H 4J1 1. The spontaneous imitation of movements, previously known in two orders of mammals, is demonstrated in a psittacine bird. 2. The animal, a Grey parrot which has bonded to humans, utilizes its torso, legs, wings, head, beak, and tongue in the imitation of human movements. 3. A new form of imitation, "non-vocal mimicry," is tentatively identified. It is defined by the use of skeletal movements to produce mimetic sounds. 4. Hierarchical relationships and phylogenetic patterns of occurrence suggest that imitative learning in birds may have evolved through the sequence: song/call learning -* vocal mimicry -- non-vocal mimicry - movement imitation. 5. These relationship and patterns, and possible differences in function and incubation time, suggest that movement imitation in birds is not homologous to that in mammals.</page><page sequence="278">920 VOLUME 122 Behaviour Vol. 122 (1992) pp. 264-273 INHERITED POPULATION DIFFERENCES IN AVOIDANCE CONDITIONING IN THREE-SPINED STICKLEBACKS, GASTEROSTEUS ACULEATUS FELICITY A. HUNTINGFORD and PETER J. WRIGHT Department of Zoology, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, U.K. Laboratory-reared predator-naive three-spined sticklebacks from two sites, one with abundant predatory fish (the high-risk site) and the other essentially predator-free (the low-risk site), were given a passive avoidance conditioning task in which they received a simulated attack from a model avian predator whenever they entered a previously-favoured feeding patch. 15/16 fish learned to avoid the dangerous patch within 15 days, but those from the high-risk site did so significantly faster and received fewer attacks in the process. The two categories of fish did not differ either in active avoidance of the attack stimulus or in the rate at which they started to re-exploit the dangerous patch once negative reinforcement ceased. It is argued that fish from high- and low-risk sites differ in the negatively reinforcing properties of the same, standardised attack. Behaviour Vol. 122 (1992) pp. 274-287 MEMORY DOES NOT CONSTRAIN INDIVIDUAL RECOGNITION IN A BIRD WITH SONG REPERTOIRES PHILIP K. STODDARD, MICHAEL D. BEECHER, PATRICIA LOESCHE and S. ELIZABETH CAMPBELL Animal Behavior Program, Guthrie Hall, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195, U.S.A. We tested the hypothesis that memory or perceptual limitations imposed by song repertoires contrain the ability of song birds to recognize their neighbours by song. Using operant conditioning procedures, we trained male song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) (median repertoire size = 8) to discriminate between two artificial song sparrow repertoires of 32 songs each (64 songs total). Both song sparrows learned to discriminate concurrently between all 32 song pairs. The birds learned later songs as quickly as they learned earlier songs. These results suggest that song sparrows are capable of memorizing the full song repertoire of their neighbours under natural conditions. In a second experiment we found that song sparrows readily generalize from one exemplar of a song type to other variations of that song type. We conclude that the evolution of song repertoires of song sparrows have neither constrained nor been constrained by individual recognition of neighbours by song. Behaviour Vol. 122 (1992) pp. 288-305 SIMULATION AND ANALYSIS OF INFORMATION-CENTER FORAGING DOUGLAS ALLCHIN Committee on Evolutionary Biology, University of Chicago I present a mathematical model and simulation of information-center (IC) foraging (WARD &amp; ZAHAVI, 1973). The results indicate that the most important condition for supporting an IC is time-limited foraging in patches supporting multiple individuals. Foraging rate is enhanced by information exchange even where the probability of finding food is otherwise relatively high (i.e. not, as generally assumed, exclusively where food is "unpredictable"). The effects of IC foraging are strongest for small populations (N &amp;lt; 20), though they increase marginally as the number of individuals increases. One can determine the critical patch-duration at which IC foraging becomes profitable and how individuals may optimally distribute search time between active scouting and vicarious search (through recruitment in the IC). As food becomes difficult to find, the optimal proportion of time an individual should scout on its own approaches roughly one-half.</page><page sequence="279">VOLUME 122 921 Behaviour Vol. 122 (1992) pp. 306-328 SEQUENTIAL ANALYSIS OF NOMINAL DATA IN MOTHER-INFANT COMMUNICATION: QUANTIFYING DOMINANCE AND BIDIRECTIONALITY Y.

HOEKSMA Faculty of Psychological and Pedagogical Sciences, Department of Developmental Psychology, Free University, Van der Boerchorststraat 1, 1081 BT Amsterdam, The Netherlands In recent studies on early communication a preference seems to exist for applying statistical methods to behaviours that have in some way been scaled. As an alternative, two methods for analyzing the interaction between two sequences of nominal data are discussed: an information-statistical analysis as developed by VAN DEN BERCKEN &amp; COOLS (1980a) and log-linear modelling. Both methods make use of contingency (transition) tables, which should be constructed according to common requirements that are often ignored in practice. Firstly, the relationships between the number of behavioural categories, the length of the recording, the complexity of the model and the reliability of the statistics need to be considered. Secondly, choices have to be made regarding the use of either time or event sequences. Although these requirements are explained and illustrated using theoretical considerations and data on early mother-infant communication in humans, the application of these models may be much broader. Since informational and log-linear statistics are mathematically related, both can be used to describe the same measures of directionality in the interaction of individual pairs.</page><page sequence="280">922 VOLUME 123 Behaviour Vol. 123 (1992) pp. 1-26 BEHAVIOURAL AND BREEDING-HABITAT RELATED ASPECTS OF SPERM COMPETITION IN RAZORBILLS RICHARD H. WAGNER Department of Zoological Research, National Zoological Park, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C. 20008-2598, U.S.A. I observed razorbill copulation behaviour to examine the ability of males to assure their paternity in the presence of sperm competition. While males in colonial species are generally unable to guard their mates throughout the female's fertile period, male razorbills suffered a special problem in that females actively sought extra-pair copulations (EPCs) and did so in two separate locations, the colony and ledges outside the colony called "mating arenas". Most within-pair and extra-pair copulations were performed in the mating arenas (74% and 82%, respectively). Individuals were consistent in their attendance in one of the two arenas, depending upon the accessibility of the breeding site from the arena, and the attendance of other individuals from the same sub-colony. Individuals were also consistent in their occupation of specific sites within the arenas, and usually attended these sites between years. Attendance in the relatively small arenas brought individuals from the sparser colony into much closer proximity than when they attended their nesting sites. The higher density in the arenas was associated with females receiving EPC attempts three times more frequently upon arrival in the arenas than in the colony. Females resisted most EPC attempts, but a high proportion (50%) of females accepted at least one EPC prior to egg-laying. Mating arena attendance by males was aimed at obtaining EPCs when their mates were absent, and at attempting to assure their paternity when their mates were present. Paternity assurance was accomplished by a) inhibiting their mates from accepting EPCs, b) depriving other males access to the female, and c) copulating with the female frequently. Males did not guard their mates effectively in that they were absent from the mating arenas during a large proportion (34%) of their mates' arrivals. The principal male strategy for gaining paternity assurance was apparently to attempt frequent copulations with their mates. Males achieved cloacal contact (and presumably insemination) with their mates approximately 80 times during the 30 days preceding the laying of the single egg, and the number of days males attended the arenas was positively correlated with the number of copulations they performed with their mates. Despite half of females accepting EPCs, EPCs accounted for only 2.4% of inseminations as a result of frequent within-pair copulations. Behaviour Vol. 123 (1992) pp. 27-37 IDEAL FREE DISTRIBUTION AND THE MECHANISM OF PATCH PROFITABILITY ASSESSMENT IN THREE-SPINED STICKLEBACKS (GASTEROSTEUS ACULEATUS) JENS KRAUSE Department of Zoology, Cambridge University, Downing Street, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, U.K. In this paper I tested four factors that might be involved in a fish's choice of a food patch: a) shoal size present in the patch b) food delivery rate c) conspecific's feeding rate d) excitement of conspecifics Single sticklebacks were presented with a choice between two display shoals feeding at different rates but were prevented from entering the food patch by a glass sheet. When size of display shoals was equal and food delivery rate different sticklebacks spent more time near the shoal with the higher food delivery rate. When the same two different food delivery rates were presented without display shoals, test fish spent about equal amounts of time in both halves of the test tank. In a third experiment different shoal sizes (5 vs 2) were presented while keeping food delivery rate constant (5 vs 5 prey items; thus individual payoffs were in the ratio 1:2.5). The test fish spent more time with the larger shoal during the prefeeding period but significantly reduced this time during the feeding period and increased it again after feeding had stopped indicating a trade-off between safety and energy intake. A final experiment investigated the influence of excitement in display shoals on the test fish's choice. The test fish was given a choice between two display shoals (20 hungry vs 20 satiated fish). During the prefeeding period, fish in the hungry shoal showed biting rates 10 times higher than that of fish in the satiated shoal (directed at the tank interior). The test fish showed no preference, indicating that biting rate/fish is not an important factor. However, the test fish turned to the hungry shoal immediately when a clay ball (which stimulated feeding movements)</page><page sequence="281">VOLUME 123 923 was introduced into each of the outer compartments. I conclude from these experiments that neither shoal size nor food delivery rate alone play a role in the initial choice among patches. Rather an individual's initial choice of patch appears to be influenced by the excitement that conspecifics show to food, which in nature may lead to selection of the more profitable patch.

PEPPER Department of Biology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI. 48109, U.S.A. RICHARD C. CONNOR Biology Department, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, Woods Hole, MA. 02543, U.S.A. Patterns of association among bottlenose dolphins resident in Shark Bay, Western Australia were ana- lyzed using party membership data. Parties contained an average of 4.8 individuals, but party size and composition were unstable. While these temporary parties often contained both males and females, long term consistent associations generally were between members of the same sex. The highest association coefficients, resulting from very frequent co-occurrence within parties were between males and between mothers and offspring. Males formed subgroups of two or three individuals who consistently associated with each other, and these were stable over periods of at least seven years in some cases. Male subgroups preferentially associated with particular other male subgroups. Females associated most consistently with other females, although not to the same extent as some males. Female associations were better described as a network rather than discrete sub-groups. Male-female associations were generally inconsistent and depended in part on female reproductive state. Mothers and their offspring associated very consistently for at least 4 years.

Carmel, Haifa, Israel Aggression in a polymorphic trait that occurs in subterranean blind mole rats of the Spalax ehrenbergi superspecies in Israel (NEVO et al., 1975, 1986; NEVO, 1991). We found Egyptian mole rats in the isolates to be pacifistic. This supports our evolutionary theory of aggression in Spalax which predicts that aggression should decrease in the desert habitat (NEVO et al., 1986), presumably to minimize overheating, water and energy expenditure. The described behaviour is a pre-requisite for social evolution. We hypothesize that pacifistic behaviour in Spalax isolates in North Africa has been adaptively selected for survival in the harsh Sahara desert ecology. Behaviour Vol. 123 (1992) pp. 77-83 THE PACE OF LIFE-REANALYSED: WHY DOES WALKING SPEED OF PEDESTRIANS CORRELATE WITH CITY SIZE? PETER WIRTZ and GREGOR RIES Institut fur Biologie der Universitat Freiburg and Forschungsstelle fur Humanethologie in der Max Planck Gesellschaft In a much quoted study, BORNSTEIN &amp; BORNSTEIN (1976) showed that the between walking speed of pedestrians is positively correlated with the size of the city. They interpreted the higher walking speed of people in larger cites as a psychological response to stimulatory overload.</page><page sequence="282">924 VOLUME 123 We also found a positive correlation between walking speed and city size. In addition, we showed that-at least in our sample-larger cities had higher proportions of young males and lower proportions of people older than 60 years. Walking speed and momentary density did not correlate positively. Because walking speed is age- and sex-dependent (Fig. 2), differences in population structure are likely to cause differences in average walking speed. The average walking speed predicted for each city according to its age- and sex-composition correlated positively with city size. The regressions of observed walking speed on population size and of walking speed predicted from age structure on population size did no differ significantly in their slopes (p &gt; 0.95). It therefore seems unnecessary to invoke other factors in addition to age composition to explain differences in average walking speeds of pedestrians.

SEALY Department of Zoology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba R3T 2N2, Canada Four host species of the parasitic brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) were exposed to taxidermic mounts of a female cowbird, fox sparrow (Passerella iliaca), and common grackle (Quicalus quiscula) at their nests during their egg-laying or nestling stage. Red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus), a species that accepts cowbird eggs laid in their nests, responded more aggressively to cowbird models early in their nesting cycle, indicating that they recognized the unique threat the cowbird posed. Gray catbirds (Dumetella carolinensis), northern orioles (Icterus galbula), and cedar waxwings (Bambycilla cedrorum) can remove cowbird eggs from their nests and for the most part they responded similarly to cowbird models and the "nonthreatening control," i.e. a fox sparrow. Cedar waxwings were nonaggressive to all the models and may rely on concealment to protect their nests from enemies. Removal of cowbird eggs by puncture ejection is more risky than grasp ejection. Despite this, orioles and waxwings (puncture ejection) were not significantly more aggressive to cowbird models at egg laying than catbirds (grasp ejectors). Responses of the three rejector species toward the cowbird model did not change over the nesting cycle, indicating further that they do not recognize cowbirds as a unique threat. Rejector species may not recognize cowbirds because they have little experience with them. With the exception of waxwings, all of the hosts recognized the grackle as an enemy and increased their levels of defence from the laying to nestling stages. Three of the host-species did not simply respond in a generalized manner to any intruder at their nests but indeed recognized specific enemies. Considerable interspecific variability exists amongst the four species in defensive behaviours, which may reflect their different nesting habitats.

JACKSON Department of Zoology, University of Canterbury, Private Bag, Christchurch, New Zealand The influence of prey movement on the performance of simple detours by salticids was investigated. Seven species were studied. Two subject species, Portia fimbriata and Portia labiata, are specialized web-invading species that eat other spiders. The other five species investigated (Euryattus sp., Euophrys parvula, Marpissa marina, Trite auricoma and Trite planiceps) are more typical cursorial hunters of insects. We provide evidence that: 1) salticids will initiate detours toward motionless prey; 2) salticids are more inclined to initiate detours toward moving than toward motionless prey; 3) salticids tend to complete detours even when prey that had been moving at the start remains stationary during the detour; 4) prey movement makes the salticid more likely to stalk and attack when prey is only a few centimetres away and in a position from which it can be reached by a straightline pursuit; 5) Portia is more inclined than the other salticids to initiate detours to motionless prey, then to stalk and attack motionless prey when close, than the other salticids are. Mechanisms that might account for Portia being different from the other salticids are discussed.</page><page sequence="283">VOLUME 123 925 Behaviour Vol. 123 (1992) pp. 121-143 THE USE OF PELAGE PIGMENTATION IN THE RECOGNITION OF MOTHERS BY DOMESTIC GOAT KIDS (CAPRA HIRCUS) CARLOS R. RUIZ-MIRANDA Graduate Group in Animal Behavior, University of California, Davis, CA 95616 Although it is known that the young play an active role in the formation of mother-young attachment in ruminants, there is scant knowledge of how neonates identify their mothers. This research investigated the use of visual cues, particularly pelage pigmentation, in maternal recognition by domestic goat kids. Observations on the use of auditory cues were carried out secondarily. The findings of this study were: (1) The analysis of error patterns revealed that goat kids performed phenotype matching on the basis of pelage pigmentation when seeking their mothers in two- and six-choice tests, at a distance of 10 m. Presenting the kids with a choice between two females of the same colour resulted in more vacillation, and fewer kids were able to go to their mother directly than when the adults were of different colours. The phenomenon was not evident when the kids were 3 days old. Because it occurred at all other ages, regardless of whether the mother was absent, covered, or fully visible, colour-matching seems to be an important aspect of maternal recognition. (2) Visual cues were important for recognition, as evidenced by the performance of kids when maternal cues were limited (i.e. the mother was covered). (3) The efficiency measures did not correlate strongly with maternal vocalizations when visual cues from the mother were not completely present or when pelage pigmentation was not a good cue for discrimination. On the contrary, kids unexpectedly vocalized more in the conditions in which they could discriminate on the basis of visual cues, that is, when the mother was bare rather than covered, and when she was paired with a doe of a different colour category rather than one of the same colour category.

CLARKE Department of Psychology, Loyola University, New Orleans, LA 70118, U.S.A., and Tulane Regional Primate Research Center, 18703 Three Rivers Road, Covington, LA 70433, U.S.A. The social play of infant and juvenile mantled howling monkeys in Costa Rica was studied via focal sampling (529.2 h) of known individuals of known age over a 22-month period. Observations of adult males (291.2 h of focal samples), done over portions of 3 calendar years, provided supplemental data for the social play of adults. Developmental patterns of play are presented, and are compared with data available for other mantled howlers, other sites, and other species of howlers. Social play by infants and juveniles occurred at the rate of .56 bouts/h, represented 5.79% of the total focal observation time, and bouts had a mean duration of 6.19 minutes. Play by an adult male occurred at the rate of .03 bouts/h (.007/h for all 4 adult males combined), represented 0.24% of his total focal time, and had a mean duration of 5.0 minutes.: Ontogenetically, social play began in the 8th week of life. Infants' rates of play and percentage of time spent in play increased from the II stage through the 13 stage, then decreased into the juvenile period (&gt; 1 year of age). Mean durations of play bouts increased through the 3 infant stages, then decreased slightly in the II stage. The occurrence of play groups (3 or more individuals) increased through the infant and juvenile stages. As infants aged, a larger percentage of bouts occurred further from the infants' and juveniles' mothers. With respect to social variables, no overall developmental pattern was evident for playing with an older or younger partner, or a partner that was the offspring of a mother ranked higher or lower than one's own mother; different age classes showed different patterns. When an older sibling was available as a play partner, no preference for' this relative was shown. 13's had the highest number of different play partners. Immature howlers played predominantly with other immatures (93% of their interactions). The behaviours observed during play were similar to those reported for other howlers; the behaviours emitted by an adult male were similar to those of the juvenile partner, as was the style and intensity of play. The social play of these mantled howlers is viewed with respect to social, demographic, and ecological variables. The play of howlers is both facilitated and constrained by these variables.</page><page sequence="284">926 VOLUME 123 Behaviour Vol. 123 (1992) pp. 173-193 ANIMAL GROUPING FOR PROTECTION FROM PARASITES: SELFISH HERD AND ENCOUNTER-DILUTION EFFECTS MICHAEL S. MOORING and BENJAMIN L. HART Graduate Group in Animal Behavior and Department of Physiological Sciences, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Davis, California 95616, U.S.A. Grouping has been widely accepted as a mechanism for protection from predation. Just as has been ap- parent with predation, there is now ample evidence that parasites (biting flies, warble flies and parasitoids) can impact an animal's individual fitness. Some aspects of grouping, namely an encounter-dilution ef- fect and the selfish herd effect, appear to apply as much to protection of animals from flying parasites as protection from predators. The encounter-dilution effect provides protection when the probability of detection of a group does not increase in proportion to an increase in group size (the encounter effect), provided that the parasites do not offset the encounter effect by attacking more members of the group (the dilution effect). The selfish herd effect provides protection from flying parasites to animals that are in the center of a group or more closely placed to other animals. Most of the quantitative evidence for the protection from flying parasites from grouping comes from studies on ungulates. Further investiga- tion of these effects among a variety of taxa is needed for a full appreciation of the role of parasites in animal grouping and sociality.

STUTCHBURY Department of Biology and Peabody Museum of Natural History, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06511, U.S.A. In many avian societies, young birds delay breeding beyond the age of sexual maturity. Most previous hypotheses of delayed breeding have emphasized forces that keep young birds from becoming breeders. We develop a model of delayed breeding which includes the future acquisition of a high quality territory as a potential direct benefit of delayed breeding. Strong differences in territory quality, age-correlated asymmetries in resource holding potential, and territory site tenacity set the stage for young birds to either breed immediately on a poor territory, or obtain a high quality territory through reproductive delay on or near the site. A wide variety of species and social organizations reveal common patterns of breeding status acquisition through behaviours as nonbreeders with site tenacity on or immediately near the breeding site. A review of 'floater' strategies reveals that nonbreeders frequently have restricted home ranges that encompass one or more breeding territories, and prior experience at a site improves their chances of acquiring a territory in future years. This pattern of territory acquisition argues for incorporating direct benefits into models of delayed breeding. We discuss the potential applications to understanding delayed breeding in social systems as apparently different as cooperatively-breeding birds, migratory passerines, colonial breeding gulls, and lek-breeding grouse and manakins.

Postal 399, Belem, Para 66.040, Brazil Groups of saddle-back (Saguinus fuscicollis) as moustached tam,arins (Saguinus mystax) in a western Amazonian forest jointly defended home ranges larger than 100 ha, which were held in common throughout the year. Resources were defended by direct exploitation in extensive areas shared with other groups, or through intensive and frequent intergroup interactions along territorial boundaries. These interactions were expressed primarily during intergroup encounters, and affected the use of space, movements, time budget, and foraging success of tamarins. During encounters, animals of both species spent more time in energetically costly activities, such as rapid and intergroup chases, and less time in energetically positive activities, such as feeding and foraging. In addition, foraging success per unit of foraging effort within overlapping areas of the range periphery was lower than in exclusive areas of the range centre, particularly</page><page sequence="285">VOLUME 123 927 for saddle-back tamarins. The time and energy allocated by moustached tamarins to boundary contests was considerably greater than that of saddle-backs, despite the fact that only the latter species increased its foraging efficiency by shifting from exclusive areas in the group's range to those shared by other groups. This is probably because of saddle-back's greater use of depletable food supplies, such as small fruit patches and small microhabitats containing embedded prey items. These benefits are likely to justify the substantial amount of time and energy invested in territorial defence for both saddle-backs and moustached tamarins, but appeared to be highly asymmetric between species.

Parental care, measured as the time spent by the female in rearing the brood, varied considerably. Habitat shelterness and food abundance in brood rearing lakes did not affect the duration of parental care. Brood mortality and size affected females' decision to abandon the brood; broods left younger experienced higher mortality during the parental care and were smaller than broods reared for longer. Offspring left by a female did not have higher mortality than same-aged offspring not left. Broods that were deserted early did also produce young to the fledging age.

Under these circumstances, parents are expected to invest extra resources in offspring of the most profitable sex. However, it is unclear whether sex-biased expenditure is the result of selection acting on parents, their offspring, or both. Current parent-offspring conflict theory is used to investigate whether by sex biases in parental expenditure should be accompanied by sex biases in parent-offspring conflict. It is suggested that, in general, greater conflict should be expected between parents and offspring of the favoured sex. Specifically, greater conflict is predicted among mother-son dyads than among mother-daughter dyads in most polygynous birds and mammals. Data on domestic sheep, as well as empirical evidence available for other species (mainly ungulates), lends support to the prediction. The prediction is further extended to cercopithecine primates, a group which lacks clear sex- biases in parental investment. In this case, differences in fitness returns per unit of parental expenditure between the daughters of dominant and subordinate mothers are positively related to differences in the extent of mother-daughter conflict. The results from this study highlight the important role that selective pressures acting on the offspring phenotype may have played in the evolution of sex-biased patterns of parental investment.</page><page sequence="286">928 VOLUME 123 Behaviour Vol. 123 (1992) pp. 290-313 SOCIAL STABILITY AND TERRITORY ACQUISITION IN BIRDS LES D. BELETSKY Department of Zoology, NJ-15, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, U.S.A. This study tested the hypothesis that one strategy birds use to acquire territories is to seek and exploit areas where conspecific social stability is weak. Predictions were that nonterritorial individuals, 'floaters,' should be attracted to areas of social instability and that they should obtain territories in unstable areas. An experiment with red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus), designed to test whether floaters are attached to boundary disputes between territorial neighbors, showed that floaters approached multiple male models in simulated boundary disputes at higher rates than they approached single models. Both drug implants that interfered with testosterone physiology in territory owners and manipulations of breeding habitat rendered certain territory aggregations socially unstable, and floaters obtained territories in those areas. Therefore, evidence generally supported the instability hypothesis of territory acquisition. No evidence was found to support an associated prediction, that a high-density breeding area should attract more floaters and thus suffer a higher territory owner turnover rate than a low-density site. Experiments with models of two species of blackbirds showed that one method floaters may use to establish territories is to settle on boundaries between adjacent owners. The potential generality of the instability hypothesis, and its implications for the expression of avian territorial behavior, are discussed. If floaters are attracted to signs of social instability, then it would be advantageous for territory owners to behave in ways that reduce the appearance of instability.

RATCLIFFE Department of Biology, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, K7L 3N6, Canada The sound environment hypothesis predicts that the features of song that are important for conspecific recognition should be those that overlap least with the songs of other species in the same location. We tested this hypothesis with song playbacks to free-living male American tree sparrows (Spizella arborea). We first used a discriminant function analysis to determine which song features best separated American tree sparrow songs from the songs of heterospecific avian species at two locations representing different sound environments. Based on this analysis we predicted which song features should be most important for conspecific recognition at each location. We then produced synthetic songs containing alterations in these features. Males, however, did not respond to playbacks of altered features as predicted. Thus, our results do not support the sound environment hypothesis of conspecific song recognition.</page><page sequence="287">VOLUME 124 929 Behaviour Vol. 124 (1993) pp. 1-22 RECONCILIATION, CONSOLATION, AND REDIRECTION IN JAPANESE MACAQUES (MACACA FUSCATA) FILIPPO AURELI, HANS C.

Box 80086, 3508 TB Utrecht, The Netherlands We studied the occurrence of social interactions after agonistic conflicts in captive Japanese macaques. We collected data on one group during the mating and the non-mating season and on another group during the mating season only. We compared the social interactions of the victim soon after a conflict with the social interactions of the same individual during control periods, using two different methods. The results obtained with the two methods were very consistent. We found clear evidence for the occurrence of reconciliation and redirection. However, there was no evidence for consolation even when we considered only affiliation between the victim and its own kin or between the victim and the aggressor's kin. Separate analyses for the two groups and the two seasons yielded very similar results. Behaviour Vol. 124 (1993) pp. 23-44 DETERMINANTS OF TIME ALLOCATION BY ADULT AND YEARLING BLACK-TAILED PRAIRIE DOGS W.J. LOUGHRY Biology Department, Valdosta State College, Valdosta, GA 31698, U.S.A. The time budgets of all adult and yearling black-tailed prairie dogs in a wild population were measured in 14 separate samples between late April and mid-August 1989. In general, males were more vigilant and fed less than females did. This sex difference was due largely to the behavior of males that had sired offspring; non-fathers behaved more like females. As the summer progressed, prairie dogs spent more time feeding and less time vigilant. The lone exception to this pattern was mothers, who fed less and spent more time vigilant as the summer progressed. Other influences on time allocation produced similar effects for all sex/parental groups: animals were more vigilant while in tall vegetation and in the early morning as opposed to mid-day or evening. Environmental (e.g. weather) and social (e.g. number of other adults and pups present) effects on time allocation were analyzed via multiple regression. Of all potential influences, distance from the nearest burrow seemed to have the most consistent impact on time allocation for all individuals. These results point to strong effects of sex, parental status and environmental context in determining the particular pattern of time allocation observed in an individual prairie dog.

Box MP167, Mount Pleasant, Harare, Zimbabwe Field and laboratory observations of mating behaviour in a population of the tropical millipede Alloporus uncinatus were carried out over one breeding season. Males obtained mates through random encounters and by forming triplet associations with copula pairs. The occurrence of triplet associations in the field was coincident with a highly male biased operational sex ratio. Mate acquisition by males was apparently stochastic and direct physical competition did not occur. In laboratory experiments mating was size- selective probably as a consequence of female choice. We consider the possibility that sperm competition has contributed to the evolution of the mating system in this species.</page><page sequence="288">930 VOLUME 124 Behaviour Vol. 124 (1993) pp. 57-72 RISK-TAKING BY JUVENILE VERVET MONKEYS LYNN A. FAIRBANKS Department of Psychiatry &amp; Biobehavioral Sciences, University of California, Los Angeles, California 90024, U.S.A. Because of their greater vulnerability to mortality, juveniles might to expected to be more conservative than adults in response to novel and potentially threatening situations. Results from research on vervet monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops sabaeus) in the field and in captivity suggest that the opposite is true. Juveniles in the field were more likely to approach a human observer, and in captivity they had shorter latencies to enter a new area, approach a novel food container, and come within a meter of a strange adult male when compared to younger and older animals. In all four test conditions, risk-taking was an inverted U-shaped function of age. Latency to approach in unfamiliar and potentially dangerous situations declined from birth to two years of age, then increased with age to adulthood. Behaviour Vol. 124 (1993) pp. 73-88 OVIPOSITION BEHAVIOUR OF DIPHAGOUS PARASITOIDS (HYMENOPTERA, APHELINIDAE): A CASE OF INTERSEXUAL RESOURCE PARTITIONING? G.H. WALTER Department of Zoology and Entomology, Rhodes University, Grahamstown 6140, South Africa Female diphagous parasitoids are endoparasitic as larvae, whereas their males are ectoparasitic. It is possible that males, during their development, eliminate competitors, and this has been proposed as the selective advantage to male ectoparasitism. In this way resources would be partitioned between the sexes. The hypothesis was tested experimentally by observation of whether mated females were capable of recognizing parasitized hosts, and whether they then deposited male eggs on them (because ectoparasitic larvae are supposed to be good competitors). The behaviour of individual Coccophagus bartletti ANNECKE &amp; INSLEY (Aphelinidae) wasps did not follow prediction, and an alternative hypothesis is proposed. Selection pressures from the environment (e.g. host) need not be the same for both sexes, and if male eggs of the pre-diphagous aphelinid were treated differently at oviposition from female eggs (as is found in at least one extant species of aphelinid with otherwise conventional host relationships), a host shift at speciation could account for the divergence in host relationships of the sexes. Behaviour Vol. 124 (1993) pp. 89-122 FUNCTIONS OF WILD GORILLA 'CLOSE' CALLS. I. REPERTOIRE, CONTEXT, AND INTERSPECIFIC COMPARISON A.H. HARCOURT and K.J. STEWART Dept. Anthropology, University of California, Davis, California 95616, U.S.A. M. HAUSER Animal Communications Lab., Dept. Zoology, University of California, Davis, California 95616, U.S.A. Individuals in social groups of a number of species produce and exchange among themselves frequent, quiet vocalisations. The function of most such vocalisations, here termed 'close' calls, remains obscure, because of the lack of any obvious context of behaviour associated with their production. In this first of two papers that attempt to determine the function of these calls in wild gorilla groups, we describe the call repertoire, the age-sex distribution of frequencies of call-types, the contexts in which the calls are given, compare the above measures with available descriptions for the other African great apes, the common and bonobo chimpanzees, and briefly speculate on possible functions. We provide sonograms and 21 acoustical measures of 15 calls in total, including eight 'close' calls, recorded from identified individuals of two habituated heterosexual groups of wild gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) of average composition for the region. In so doing, we provide the most detailed description yet of any great ape's within-group vocalisations. The age-sex classes differed in their use of 'close' calls: adult males called the most in total, immatures the least; and while most classes gave all calls, they gave them at differing frequencies. The differences were consistent across the two-year study period. We suggest two main contexts of production, namely situations of potential separation, and potentially agonistic situations. Thus animals called when far from</page><page sequence="289">VOLUME 124 931 others and before changes in group activity, and they called when unusually close to one another, especially while feeding. In comparison to the closely related common and bonobo chimpanzees, gorillas apparently had no calls specific to subordinate individuals behaving submissively: subordinate gorillas gave calls in such a situation, but they and dominants gave the same calls (at our current level of analysis) in other situations also. Acoustically and functionally, the gorilla's 'close' calls can be separated into 'syllabled' grunts and 'non-syllabled' longer calls, we suggest. 'Syllabled' calls might function to maintain contact between animals, to coordinate activity, and to act as mild threats; 'non-syllabled' calls might function as appeasement signals, and to cohere and coordinate group movement when given at good feeding sites, both by attracting animals to the site, and by inhibiting competition at it.

Jose Guti6rrez Abascal 2, 28006 Madrid, Spain The consequences of tail loss on the thermal biology of high-altitude rock lizards (Lacerta monticola) were studied by comparing field body temperatures, selected body temperatures in a gradient, and behavioural patterns of thermoregulation of tailed and tailless lizards in the field. Neither field nor selected body temperatures differed significantly between these groups. Time spent basking, mean duration of basking, and basking frequency did not differ between tailed and tailless lizards. Tailless lizards seemingly adjusted for running impairment by using rocks to a greater extent than did tailed lizards, and low morning body temperatures by increasing maximal duration of basking periods and keeping shorter distances to the nearest refuge. Tailless lizards modify thermoregulatory behaviour, but obtain the same thermoregulatory precision as tailed lizards, possibly allowing maximization of physiological processes linked to tail regeneration. Behaviour Vol. 124 (1993) pp. 137-164 DEVELOPMENT OF ANTISNAKE DEFENSES IN CALIFORNIA GROUND SQUIRRELS (SPERMOPHILUS BEECHEYI): II. MICROEVOLUTIONARY EFFECTS OF RELAXED SELECTION FROM RATTLESNAKES RICHARD G. COSS, KEVIN L. GUSE, NAOMIE S. PORAN and DAVID G. SMITH Department of Psychology and Anthropology, University of California, Davis, California 95616 U.S.A. Nonvenomous Pacific gopher snakes (Pituophis melanoleucus catenifer) and venomous northern Pacific rattlesnakes (Crotalus viridis areganus) have coexisted in a predatory-prey relationship with California ground squirrels (Spermophilus beecheyi) for many thousands of generations. This long-term relationship has fostered in ground squirrels the evolution of antisnake defenses that consist of physiological resistance to rattlesnake venom and behavioral tactics of probing and harassing that might facilitate snake-species discrimination. Snake harassment by adults might also protect pups by interfering with snake hunting activities. Some ground squirrel populations have colonized habitats where rattlesnakes, but not gopher snakes, are rare or absent. Initial research indicates that squirrels experiencing relaxed selection from rattlesnakes are very aggressive toward their remaining nonvenomous snake predator, the gopher snake. Two experiments investigated the effects of relaxed selection from rattlesnakes by examining: 1) changes in level of venom resistance, 2) the reorganization of antisnake behaviors in lab-born pups and wild-caught adults from different sites, and 3) the role of natural experiences on the development of antisnake behavior in a rattlesnake-adapted population. Level of venom resistance was examined by an in vitro radioimmunoassay of serum-to-venom binding of two populations of Douglas ground squirrels (S. b. douglasii). The ancestors of one population are estimated to have experienced relaxed selection from rattlesnakes for about 9,000 years based on genetic distance and radiocarbon analyses. The antisnake behavior of 60-73 day-old lab-born pups from these two populations was video taped during presentations of a caged rattlesnake or gopher snake for alternate 5-min trials in a seminatural laboratory setting. Two groups of wild-caught adult Beechey ground squirrels (S. b. beecheyi) were studied using the same protocol for examining antisnake behavior. One group was obtained from a population that recently colonized a rattlesnake-rare site and exhibits moderate venom resistance. The second group came from a population that exhibits very low venom resistance and</page><page sequence="290">932 VOLUME 124 inhabits a rattlesnake-free site; relaxed selection from rattlesnakes for this populations is estimated to span approximately 60,000 years. Comparisons of Douglas ground squirrels from rattlesnake-abundant and rattlesnake-rare sites revealed that venom resistance declined approximately 59% after an estimated 9,000 years of relaxed selection from rattlesnake. Lab-born Douglas pups from the same rattlesnake-rare site were more aggressive toward the gopher snake than toward the rattlesnake whereas pups from the population experiencing predation from both species of snake treated both snakes as similarly dangerous. Unlike pups, wild-caught adults from the rattlesnake-adapted population harassed the rattlesnake more intensely than the gopher snake, a phe- nomenon that may reflect their experience with snakes in nature and larger body size that reduces their vulnerability to envenomation. Wild-caught Beechey ground squirrels that recently colonized a rattlesnake- rare side did not differentiate the rattlesnake and gopher snake whereas Beechey ground squirrels whose ancestors have experienced prolonged relaxed selection from rattlesnakes were more aggressive toward the gopher snake. Consistent with previous findings, prolonged relaxed selection from rattlesnakes, but not gopher snakes, appears to have reduced the inhibition to harass large gopher snakes. This microevo- lutionary shift in increased aggressiveness toward the gopher snake could result from the virtual absence of any risk in misidentifying rattlesnakes from gopher snakes. Behaviour Vol. 124 (1993) pp. 165-196 THE ROLE OF DISPERSAL IN STRUCTURING THE CHITWAN TIGER POPULATION JAMES L. DAVID SMITH Department of Fisheries and Wildlife, 200 Hodson Hall, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN 55108, U.S.A. Dispersal in tigers was studied in Royal Chitwan National Park, Nepal. Thirty six adult and young were studied to monitor movements and social interactions relative to dispersal. Fourteen subadults were followed from before their dispersal until they died or established post-dispersal territories. Subadult tigers became semi-independent of their mother when her next litter was born. They usually remained within her natal area until the subsequent litter began to move with her at about 2 mos of age. Animals dispersed between 19 and 28 mos. Males dispersed farther than females and settled in poorer habitat. Three of 4 females settled adjacent to their mothers; in two cases the mother shifted her territory allowing the daughter to take over a large portion of the mother's former territory. Wounds on young prior to dispersal indicated that aggression prompted dispersal. Fights were observed between dispersers and residents. After fights, dispersers always left the resident's area. All 4 dispersing females established breeding territories. Females settled next to their mothers tending to reduce the genetic variance of a male's offspring. Eight of 10 males became localized in temporary, post-dispersal territories; 4 of the 8 survived. Two males died of poisoning and 2 from intrasexual aggression. Surviving males either expanded temporary territories or shifted to new areas to establish breeding territories. The Chitwan tigers are an isolated remnant of a population once continuous across the lowlands of Nepal. Effective population size was estimated to be &lt;30 animals. Tigers did not disperse across cultivated areas but did travel through degraded forest habitat. No animal dispersed outside the Chitwan region and there appear to be effective barriers separating Chitwan from the two nearest populations 150 and 250 kms distant. The Chitwan population is probably one of the largest tiger populations remaining in the world. Isolation and small size threaten these populations with stochastic events that may lead to further reduction in population size.

The main result was an increase in the intake when the environment was variable and food abundance intermediate, compared to the intake in a superabundant and stable environment. The experiment consisted of three periods. During the base-line period of the experiment all animals had superabundant food. During the next period half the animals continued in the base-line environment and the other half were presented with a variable environment with food bowls that changed</page><page sequence="291">VOLUME 124 933 places between trials. During the final period the environmental situations for the animals were reversed. Food intake was stable during the base-line period. During the second period the animals in the variable environment ate more than the animals in the base-line environment. During the third period the intake for the animals now in the variable environment increased whereas the intake in the stable environment decreased. The conclusion of the present study is that Mongolian gerbils will increase their food intake in response to variable and diminished food access. These are factors that in a natural environment could predict food scarcity. Behaviour Vol. 124 (1993) pp. 207-226 TEMPORAL AND ACOUSTIC CORRELATES IN VOCAL EXCHANGE OF COO CALLS IN JAPANESE MACAQUES HIDEKI SUGIURA Department of Anthropology, Faculty of Science, The University of Tokyo, Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113, Japan Vocal exchanges of coo calls in female Japanese macaques were observed in two populations. Temporal patterns of occurrence of these vocalizations during vocal interaction were studied by analyzing inter-call intervals between two consecutive coos. When the second call was uttered by a different caller from the first (DC sequence), most of the second calls occurred at intervals shorter than approximately 0.8 sec, and the remaining ones at intervals longer than approximately 0.8 sec. These results indicate that the second coos of DC sequence are of two different types, and that second calls separated by short intervals may occur in response to the first call, whereas second calls separated by a relatively longer interval may occur independently of the preceding call. When an animal responds to a coo given by another, she appears to do so within a certain period of time. When two consecutiove calls were uttered by the same caller (SC sequence), the second coos rarely occurred within 0.8 sec, but mostly at longer intervals. These results suggest that when an animal utters a coo spontaneously, it remains silent for a short interval and when no response occurs, she is likely to give further coos addressing groups members. Acoustic analysis of two consecutive coos in DC sequence showed that the second coos given by a different caller and occurring within 0.8 sec significantly correlated with those of first coos with respect to several acoustic parameters. This correlation was not observed when coos occurred at intervals of more than 0.8 sec. This phenomenon was confirmed by a playback experiment. The results suggest the possibility that an animal is able to alter acoustic features of responding coos and matches those of preceding coos. Behaviour Vol. 124 (1993) pp. 227-248 POLYANDRY AND INCEST AVOIDANCE IN THE COOPERATIVE STRIPE-BACKED WREN OF VENEZUELA WALTER H. PIPER and GARY SLATER Department of Biological Sciences, Lilly Hall, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907, U.S.A. We made behavioral observations in 37 social groups of the communal stripe-backed wren during 1990 and 1991 to investigate the recently-discovered shared paternity between dominant and subordinate males (or "SMs"). We found two distinct kinds of social groups that differed in terms of social behavior: "mother" groups, which contained only subordinate males that were sons of the dominant female (termed "DF-sons"), and "stepmother" groups, which contained at least one subordinate male unrelated to the dominant female (termed "DF-stepsons"). In mother groups only dominant males courted dominant females, mate-guarding was infrequent and aggression by dominant males toward other males was absent. On the other hand, stepmother groups were characterized by frequent association with and courtship of dominant females ("DFs") by both dominant males ("DMs") and DF-stepsons and relatively frequent aggression by dominant males toward DF-stepsons. DF-stepsons, moreover, sired 15% of all young in stepmother groups. Thus, incest avoidance dictated the behavior of subordinate males, and the mating system in wren groups was either monogamous or polyandrous, depending upon the relatedness between subordinate males and the dominant female.</page><page sequence="292">934 VOLUME 124 Behaviour Vol. 124 (1993) pp. 249-266 AGGRESSIVE PERFORMANCE AS A BEHAVIORAL CORRELATE OF PLUMAGE POLYMORPHISM IN THE WHITE-THROATED SPARROW (ZONOTRICHIA ALBICOLLIS) JEFFREY G. KOPACHENA and J. BRUCE FALLS Department of Zoology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, M5S lAI Morph and sex-specific differences in aggressive performance were examined in the white-throated spar- row. Among the four morph/sex classes, white-striped males had the strongest response to white-striped models and were the most likely to approach and attend song playbacks independently. The slightly weaker responses of tan-striped males and white-striped females were similar to each other. Tan-striped females were the least aggressive. Aggression by white-striped females enabled tan-striped male x white-striped female pairs to perform as well, or better, than white-striped male x tan-striped female pairs. Tan-striped males paired earlier than white-striped males. An increased prevalence of territorial tan-striped males cor- responded to the arrival of females on the breeding grounds. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that negative assortative mating benefits tan-striped males through the supplemental aggression of white- striped females. However, the apparent preference of white-striped females for tan-striped males suggests that there are benefits to negative asortative mating other than those that might arise from differences in aggressive performance. Behaviour Vol. 124 (1993) pp. 267-290 TEMPORAL PATTERNS OF WITHIN-PAIR COPULATIONS, MALE MATE-GUARDING, AND EXTRA-PAIR EVENTS IN EASTERN RED-WINGED BLACKBIRDS (AGELAIUS PHOENICEUS) DAVID F. WESTNEAT Center for Evolutionary Ecology, T.H. Morgan School of Biological Sciences, 101 Morgan Building, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40506-0225, U.S.A. I studied the timing of within-pair and extra-pair behaviors in an eastern population of red-winged black- birds. Within-pair activity was highest several days before egg-laying started and during the morning and evening hours. Extra-pair events also peaked just before egg-laying but showed no distinct diurnal pattern. Red-winged blackbird pairs on average copulated 21-22 times per clutch. Males followed their females more than the reverse, but spent only a third of the time within 10 m of their mates. Male presence on the territory deterred potential extra-pair events, and although males were on their territories for 94% of their day, they did leave, apparently to forage, on occasion. Extra-pair events involving these males' fe- males were likely during these departures than expected by chance. Apparently as a consequence, males went on fewer forays when their female was most fertilizable. Males did not copulate with their females more often than normal before or after forays or intrusions. Pairs that copulated more often had fewer extra-pair fertilizations in their broods, but no other behaviors were correlated with paternity. These re- sults have several important implications for understanding the effects of sperm competition of mating and parental behavior. Behaviour Vol. 124 (1993) pp. 291-312 SOUND TRANSMISSION: A BASIS FOR DIALECTS IN BIRDSONG? E.M. DATE and R.E. LEMON Department of Biology, McGill University, Montreal, P.Q. Canada, H3A lB1 The environmental adaptation hypothesis (EAH) regarding birdsong dialects or neighbourhoods states that song similarities between neighbouring individuals arise because of common influences on their songs exerted by the acoustic environment of their habitat. An assumption of the hypothesis is that sounds are distorted differently by different types of habitat. A prediction of the hypothesis is that some songs or parts of songs transmit better than others, depending on the habitat of their origin. We tested the assumption and prediction by comparing the attenuation and differential attenuation of pure tones, decreases in modal frequencies of computer simulated songs of American redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla), and the decay of redstart songs and white noise at deciduous, coniferous and open forest sites. The songs were representative of those used by redstarts living in the three habitats. Results supported the assumption</page><page sequence="293">VOLUME 124 935 of acoustic differences between habitats but did not support the prediction that some songtypes transmit with less distortion in specific habitats than in others. The EAH also predicts that individuals which inhabit similar vegetation should share more song features than individuals which inhabitat dissimilar vegetation. To test this prediction samples of songs were taken from the three habitats in different years. There were significant associations by habitat in both samples, but only one of several variables measured was significant and the discriminating variable was not the same for the two periods. Considering together the tests of the assumption and the two predictions, we conclude that for American redstarts evidence of the influence of the acoustic features of habitat on the formation of song dialects is mixed and not convincing. Behaviour Vol. 124 (1993) pp. 313-326 EFFECT OF FAMILIARITY WITH THE MOTHER AND KINSHIP ON INFANTICIDAL AND ALLOPARENTAL BEHAVIOUR IN VIRGIN HOUSE MICE FRANCESCA R. D'AMATO Instituto di Psicobiologia e Psicofarmacologia, via Reno 1, 00198 Roma, Italy Experienced male and female house mice encountering a newborn pup can display indifference, parental or infanticidal behaviour. Characteristics of the pup such as sex and strain do not seem to influence the likelihood of infanticide, in contrast to attributes of the adult subjects (age, sex, strain, sexual experience, previous cohabitation with the mother, reproductive condition). This study investigated the effect of kinship and/or familiarity with the mother on male and female behaviour towards pups. The subjects were 100-day-old Swiss-Webster virgin male and female mice. After 24 hours of isolation, a 24-36 hrs old pup was introduced into their home-cage and their behaviour was recorded for 15 min. Male and female mice killed related as well as unrelated pups. Females killed fewer offspring of females with whom they had cohabited until 3 weeks before the study, in comparison with the offspring of completely unfamiliar females. When females were exposed to the offspring of females of comparable familiarity but different relatedness, they devoted more parental behaviour towards more related pups. This suggests that, even if familiarity plays a major role in determining females' behaviour, kin recognition occurs and is responsible for differences in alloparental care distribution. The behavioural strategies adopted by male and female mice are interpreted on the basis of differences in activity range of the sexes within a deme (breeding group).</page><page sequence="294">936 VOLUME 125 Behaviour Vol. 125 (1993) pp. 1-20 THE INTERACTION OF EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL FACTORS IN THE COURTSHIP OF PARASITIC WASPS (HYM., PTEROMALIDAE) F. JACHMANN and J. VAN DE ASSEM Zoological Laboratory, Div. Ethology, University of Leiden, PO Box 9516, 2300 RA Leiden, The Netherlands Our topic of interest is the causal organization of courtship and mating behaviour of parasitic wasps (Hymenoptera, Pteromalidae), more especially that of Nasonia vitripennis. Males pursue newly emerged females over a short distance, mount on top, and take up a position at the front, the fore tarsi placed on the female's head. Courtship displays consist of characteristic combinations of motor patterns, which are repeated a variable number of times in so-called courtship cycles. Movements with the wings, head, mouthparts, and antennae are conspicuous components. This applies in particular to head-nodding movements, which occur in series. A female may become sexually receptive while being courted; she signals the onset of this condition with a movement of her antennae. The male will react promptly: he stops courting and backs up into the copulatory position. The signal coincides almost invariably with the first nod of a series; signaling at other times led to a postponement of the backing-up reaction. Because Nasonia males readily court on dummy females, we used a dummy with moveable antennae to investigate the temporal relationship of signal and reaction. We observed two types of postponed backing- up reactions: simple backing up, and backing up after performance of one or more display movements. At the same time, we found a quantitative relationship between durations of the latencies, and the timing of the signal relative to the display. Our investigations produced evidence for endogenous, periodic changes, which take place during the succession of courtship cycles. The postponed backing-up reactions of different types could be explained in terms of interactions between the effects of signalling and the endogenous dynamics of courting males. Behaviour Vol. 125 (1993) pp. 21-38 ANALYSIS OF THE BROODING CYCLE OF BROODY JUNGLEFOWL HENS WITH CHICKS A.J. HOGAN-WARBURG, LINDA PANNING and JERRY A. HOGAN Department of Psychology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada M5S lAI Broody hens with chicks show a sequence of behaviors that is cyclical in nature: brooding, preening, feeding with drinking, exploring, dustbathing, and then brooding once again. In inexperienced hens, the average cycle length was about half an hour, with brooding and feeding taking up about 90% of the time. The amount of brooding, preening, and feeding correlated positively with the length of the cycle, whereas exploring and dustbathing had no significant effect on cycle length. Hens with previous experience brooding chicks showed a significantly shorter cycle length, but the sequence of behaviors was unaltered. The results were discussed in the context of ultradian rhythms in behavior. A clock mechanism was not able to account for the results. A model that included the interaction of causal factors provided by the chicks and by the hen's dustbathing system was more successful. Behaviour Vol. 125 (1993) pp. 39-50 ON THE ONTOGENY OF SEED HARVESTING TECHNIQUES IN FREE RANGING GROUND SQUIRRELS ADOLF HESCHL Institute of Zoology, University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria Occasionally, adult European ground squirrels can be observed to practise a quite complex behavioural technique to obtain seed grains from the top of tall grass plants (e.g. Festuca ovina: 10-70 cm, Poaceae). They bite through the stem of a plant at the basis and, subsequently, know how to handle the fallen stem so as to successfully reach the food. The present field study aimed to analyse the detailed ontogeny which, in growing ground squirrels, leads to this behaviour. Data for 5 juveniles belonging to one litter were collected during an observation period of 38 successive days after the animals' first appearance above ground (video recordings). They show that this behaviour emerges as the final result of a whole series of successive developmental steps involving increasingly more efficient techniques in which simple techniques are gradually elaborated to more sophisticated ones. The underling causal mechanism is</page><page sequence="295">VOLUME 125 937 supposed to be operant conditioning based on increasingly more complex motor activities involving the animal's paws. Despite frequent social contacts, learning through imitation or even through instruction by the mother turned out to be not an important factor. With regard to cognitive abilities, the observations suggest experiments to verify the hypothesis of a beginning object permanence in ground squirrels. Behaviour Vol. 125 (1993) pp. 51-66 FUNCTION OF THE SONG AND SONG REPERTOIRE IN THE EUROPEAN STARLING (STURNUS VULGARIS): AN AVIARY EXPERIMENT MARCEL EENS, RIANNE PINXTEN and RUDOLF FRANS VERHEYEN Department of Biology, University of Antwerp, U.I.A., Universiteitsplein 1, B-2610 Wiljirk, Belgium We confronted individually-caged male European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, with conspecifics of both sexes in order to study singing behaviour during intrasexual and intersexual encounters. Males spent more time at the nestbox, sang more songs and more song types during female presentations than during control periods (observation periods with no conspecifics). Males also sang more songs in the nestbox and flew more to the nestbox with green nest material. During male presentations, only the time spent at the nestbox and the carrying of nest material increased significantly. Males spent more time at the nestbox, sang more songs and more song types in response to a female stimulus than to a male stimulus. Males also sang more songs in the nestbox and flew more to the nestbox with nest material during female than during male presentations. These results suggest that the song and song repertoire of male starlings serve primarily an intersexual rather than an intrasexual function. However, in contrast to a previous study, our results suggest that singing also serves as an intrasexual signal to deter rivals at close encounter. We also tested the hypothesis that the 'whistles' and the 'warbling song' have separate intrasexual and intersexual functions, as has been suggested in the literature. We found no evidence for a specialized intrasexual function of the whistles nor for a specialized intersexual function of the warbling song. From this study it also appears that variations in the size of the aviary can modify the behavioural responses of starling males. New information with regard to the use of green nest material by male starlings is given. Behaviour Vol. 125 (1993) pp. 67-78 SONG SHARING AND LOCAL DIALECTS IN A POPULATION OF THE EUROPEAN WREN TROGLODYTES TROGLODYTES CLIVE K. CATCHPOLE and ARMANDA ROWELL Department of Biology, Royal Holloway, University of London, Egham, Surrey TW20 OEX, U.K. Songs were recorded from a local population of 13 male wrens at Wraysbury Lakes, Berkshire, U.K. during 1991. Sonagraphic analysis revealed that there were 15 distinct song types in the population, and the each male had between three and six song types in his repertoire. Song sharing between neighbouring males was particularly high. Six of the males in the population were on the east bank of the lake, separated from the other seven on the west bank by 200 metres of open water. Although three song types were distributed over the whole area, six were unique to the east bank and six to the west. Any male could be classified as an east or west bank male, by the possession of several distinct song types unique to each 'dialect' area. So far, clear examples of dialects have been largely restricted to species with only one or two song types in their repertoires. Song sharing and the development of local dialects in the wren are discussed in relation to current views on mechanisms of social learning in songbirds. Behaviour Vol. 125 (1993) pp. 79-155 A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF STIMULUS SELECTION IN THE FILIAL FOLLOWING RESPONSE OF FRY OF SUBSTRATE SPAWNING CICHLID FISH GERARD P. BAERENDS Dept. of Zoology, University of Groningen, the Netherlands This paper reports on experimental research undertaken to analyse the information processing mechanism by which the fry of substrate spawning cichlid fish visually recognise their guarding parent(s), already from the earliest time they are able to swim. The study is inspired by LORENZ' concept of 'innate releasing mechanism' (IRM) and aims at penetrating into the problem of how species-characteristic predispostions to repond selectively to particular environmental stimuli could be brought about.</page><page sequence="296">938 VOLUME 125 Stimulus selection is studied by means of dummies. A discussion on the methodology of dummy ex- periments, especially on the pros and cons of successive and simultaneous presentation of the different dummies, precedes the presentation of the results (Chapter II). In Chapter III of this paper, the effectiveness of relative brightness, melanistic patterning and overall colour of the parent in eliciting the approach response was comparatively examined in fry of 15 different cichlid species, by means of choice tests between two dummies. Although selection for the same stimuli was often found to be shared by different species, the set of different stimuli inducing approach varied in a for each species characteristic way. This set only roughly matches the colouration shown by the parents in the period they are guarding the fry, a roughness which cannot be attributed to limitations of the visual capacities of the young fish. It is argued that this suggests an information processing procedure in which species-characteristic behaviour elements (fixed patterns and clusters of them) are activated when signals from a particular set of detectors have reached a 'selector' unit specifically controlling the response. Such a model (see Figs. 1 and 2) was earlier developed by BAERENDS (1982, 1985) for the recognition of eggs as an object to incubate in gulls. This information processing construction would provide a naive animal with an 'identification key' for recognizing environmental situations that are vital to it. The capacity of an animal to build the species-specific connections between each selector and a set of detectors is thought to have developed through selection during the evolution of the species. Cichlasoma nigrofasciatum provided an opportunity to investigate this because, beside the grey and darkly barred common morph of this species, also an amelanistic white morph exists. Chapter IV of this paper reports on experiments testing the relative effectiveness for eliciting approach of each of 10 dummies in which features of the dark morph (grey groundcolour, black bars) had stepwise been modified towards the overall white of the mutant. By means of successive presentation, rank orders of decreasing effectiveness of these dummies were established for fry of the dark morph, the white morph, of mixed pairs and of Fl-hybrids between both morphs, either kept with the parents or raised with peers only. These rank orders did not differ significantly. An entirely black dummy and a dummy with black vertical bars on a white background (a contrast exceeding that on the fish) came out at the top. The conclusion was drawn that a predisposition for recognizing the colour pattern of the parent is present which roughly matches the appearance of the dark morph and that this same predisposition is present in the white mutation. However, a comparison of the variation in the rank orders found for dark morph and for white morph fry, both raised with parents, indicated that during the parental period acquisition of knowledge about the actual appearance of the parents takes place in the young. In the dark morph this learnt knowledge reinforces the predisposed information and causes the statistical significance of the rank order to increase. In the white morph both sources of information act largely contradiction. However, the effect of learning, which was also demonstrated in choice tests, did not entirely override the predisposed preference. The suggestion that the predisposed information about features of the adequate situation for eliciting an action pattern under natural conditions guides a relevant extension of knowledge about that situation through learning, is further investigated in chapter V in experiments on Cichlasoma meeki. The conclusion drawn by BAERENDS &amp; BAERENDS-VAN ROoN (1950), from results of successive dummy presentation, that the fry of this species have to learn that the parental dress shows a pattern of red and grey, had to be rejected after the more sensitive choice experiments carried out in the present study had demonstrated a predisposed preference for this combination in naive fry. Experienced fry, however, were found to have strengthened this preference and clearly selected for dummies with the red colour on the ventral side. Finally in Chapter VI some questions concerning the nature of predispositions are considered and the literature relevant to the functions and consequences of learning about features of the parents for partner selection in later life is discussed.

HANEGRAAF Ethology and Socio-ecology Group, Utrecht University, Postbox 80.086, 3508 TB, The Netherlands MatMan is a program for performing a variety of ethological analyses of frequency (interaction) matrices and transition matrices. These analyses include linear hierarchy indices for dominance matrices (APPLEBY, 1983), reorganization of a dominance matrix such that the subjects are in rank order, matrix correlation methods such as Mantel's test (MANTEL, 1967) and rowwise matrix correlation (DE VRIES, 1993), methods based on information theory (STEINBERG, 1977), and the calculation of expected and residual values in transition matrices with deinfined or undefined diagonal. In addition, MatMan offers some useful options for manipulating matrices. Import of matrices from The Observer (NOLDUS, 1991) and SAS is, within certain</page><page sequence="297">VOLUME 125 939 limitations, possible. Export of matrices is possible to the programs CoRAN (1985), Vegrow (FRESCO, 1989), NCSS (HINTZE, 1987), SAS and SPSSPC. Behaviour Vol. 125 (1993) pp. 177-188 THE CHICK'S PREFERENCE FOR CERTAIN FEATURES OF THE MATERNAL CLUCK VOCALIZATION IN THE DOMESTIC FOWL (GALLUS GALLUS) J.P. KENT Ballyrichard House, Arklow, Co. Wicklow, Ireland The predominant frequency, rate of clucking and intensity of the maternal cluck vocalization of the broody hen (Gallus gallus) are described. The frequency, rate of clucking, and level of intensity of the cluck vocalizations were altered independently of each other. Three-day-old chicks were given a simultaneous choice test between the normal and an altered cluck or between the two altered clucks in a 'T' shaped simultaneous choice test apparatus. No significant preferences were found when the frequency was increased or decreased by 25% (Experiment IA) but the chicks significantly prefer the normal cluck over a cluck with a 33% increase in frequency. The preference for the normal cluck over the 33% decrease in frequency was nearly significant (Experiment 1 B). Thus, there exists an optimal frequency range for the maternal cluck vocalization of the domestic hen. When the rate of clucking was increased or decreased by 25% the chicks preferred the higher rate of clucking in all conditions (Experiment 2). However, the highest rate of clucking used in this experiment was close to that of the normal cluck. When the intensity was increased or decreased by 100% no significant preferences were found in any choice test (Experiment 3). This contrasts with earlier findings possibly due to a methodological difference. Behaviour Vol. 125 (1993) pp. 189-198 FRONT INDIVIDUALS LEAD IN SHOALS OF THREE-SPINED STICKLEBACKS (GASTEROSTEUS ACULEATUS) AND JUVENILE ROACH (RUTILUS RUTILUS) DIRK BUMANN and JENS KRAUSE Institut fur Verhaltensbiologie, Freie Universitat Berlin, Haderslebenerstrasse 9, W-1000 Berlin 41, Federal Republic of Germany and Department of Zoology, University of Cambridge, Downing Street, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, U.K. Fish shoals are usually seen as anonymous leaderless groups in which all individuals have the same influence on swimming velocity and direction. This hypothesis was tested by investigated swimming directions of shoals of roach (Rutilus rutilus) and three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). In roach, the influence of front and rear fish on the shoal's swimming direction was compared by analysing video recordings. Front fish initiated new directions significantly more often and were followed by rear fish. In a second experiment two shoals of stickebacks were released from two channels which were positioned at an angle relative to each other. The shoals usually appeared with a short time difference at the opening of the channels and then merged. Initially the two shoals faced in different directions based on the orientation of their respective channel and it was recorded which direction prevailed after the shoals had merged. The shoal that left the channel first, and therefore formed the front part of the merged shoal, clearly dominated the direction. Thus, both experiments gave evidence for front fish having a dominant influence on the direction of the shoal. In the context of sustained position preferences of individual fish, recently observed in roach, this suggests that fish shoals may have leaders over extended time periods. Behaviour Vol. 125 (1993) pp. 199-218 DIFFERENCES IN SITE FIDELITY AMONG TERRITORIAL MALES OF THE CARPENTER BEE XYLOCOPA VARIPUNCTA (HYMENOPTERA: ANTHOPHORIDAE) JOHN ALCOCK Department of Zoology, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287-1501, USA Lekking males of the carpenter bee Xylocapa (Neoxylocapa) varipuncta compete for landmark territories, where they are occasionally visited by receptive females. In a study conducted over three flight seasons,</page><page sequence="298">940 VOLUME 125 less than 10% of marked males qualified as long-term residents (i.e. bees that held the same hovering station for 90 min or more on at least two afternoons). However, among the small minority of long-term residents were some bees that returned to the same landmark for up to 3 hr every afternoon for several weeks. These males defeated many intruders in aerial combat during each afternoon. The hypothesis that site-faithful males were individuals of unusual resource-holding power is not supported. Long-term residents were not larger on average than short-term territory holders. Moreover, the frequency of mating by long-term residents was very similar to that of males in the general population, suggesting that long-term residents did not hold territories that were exceptionally attractive to females. Thus, the basis for site fidelity in this species remains elusive. The rarity of site-faithful males in this species may be related to great daily fluctuations in the numbers of potentially receptive females visiting the landmark territories, which may make the timing of male mate-attracting behavior far more important than regularly returning to defend any one site. Behaviour Vol. 125 (1993) pp. 219-232 FEMALE RESISTANCE AND PRECOPULATORY GUARDING IN THE ISOPOD IDOTEA BALTICA (PALLAS) VEIJO JORMALAINEN and SAMI MERILAITA Department of Biology, Lab. of Animal Ecology, University of Turku, SF-20500 Turku, Finland In a laboratory experiment in I. baltica the precopulatory guarding was preceded by a period of struggles between the sexes as males continuously tried to initiate the precopulatory guarding and females resisted their guarding attempts. This struggling lasted for a few days, during which the females escaped from the males on the average 1.3 times per hour. While the females resisted, the males usually responded by kicking back. Once the precopula started, on the average 43 h before the completion of the female parturial ecdysis, the female resistance stopped. If the guarding male was replaced by another male, the female accepted the new male without resistance or resisted only weakly. Larger males were able to perform longer precopulas, and furthermore, when males were hunger stressed they performed shorter precopulas than control males. The female resistance and the existence of struggles imply a conflict between the sexes over whether or not to start the precopulatory phase. This conflict may occur either because of different optimum precopula duration of the sexes or because of the unwillingness of the females to pair with whatever male. By resisting, females may, at least to some extent, control the duration of the guarding, and the resistance may lead to selection among male candidates. Thus the female resistance, although for so far largely neglected, may have potential importance in the mate choice and sexual selection of aquatic crustaceans with precopulatory guarding. Behaviour Vol. 125 (1993) pp. 233-244 BROOD SIZE AND OFFSPRING AGE AFFECT RISK-TAKING AND AGGRESSION IN NEST-GUARDING COMMON GOBIES CARIN MAGNHAGEN Dept. of Aquaculture, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences S-901 83 Ume?a, Sweden KLAUS VESTERGAARD Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University, Dept. of Animal Science and Animal Health, DK-1870 Copenhagen, Denmark The importance of brood size, offspring age, and male size for parental care behaviour was studied in the common goby, Pomatoschistus microps. In field observation, the aggression of nest guarding males was measured as attacks towards a finger when disturbing the nest. Attacking males had larger and more developed clutches compared to non-attacking males, but did not differ in body size. In another set of observations nest guarding males were exposed to a predator (eelpout, Zoarces viviparus) and subsequently chased away from their nests. Time away from the nest decreased significantly with egg developmental stage, i.e. with the time the male had spent guarding a particular brood. However, no correlations with male body length or numbers of eggs in the nest were found. We conclude that male common gobies evaluate future reproductive success by using brood age and brood size as cues for making decisions about risk-taking and aggressive behaviour during parental care.</page><page sequence="299">VOLUME 125 941 Behaviour Vol. 125 (1993) pp. 245-264 EFFECTS OF PRIMARY IMPRINTING OF THE SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENT OF SECONDARY FILIAL ATTACHMENTS IN THE CHICK GERRIT J. DE VOS and HENDRIK S. VAN KAMPEN Zoological Laboratory, University of Groningen, P.O. Box 14, 9750 AA Haren, The Netherlands This study reinvestigates the effects of primary imprinting of chicks with either a naturalistic stimulus or an artificial object on subsequent imprinting with artificial objects. Initial experience with a live chick (group C) or a yellow cylinder (group Y) had differential effects on the development of a secondary filial attachment in chicks. In chicks of both groups, growth of attachment to the novel imprinting object manifested itself rather abruptly, but the change in response to the novel object occurred later in C- than in Y-chicks. There was no difference between the groups in the outcome of secondary imprinting: chicks in groups C and Y eventually became equally strongly attached to their novel imprinting stimulus, and when exposed to a third object, chicks in both groups imprinted equally well on this object. Thus, (1) initial imprinting on a naturalistic stimulus postponed, but did not block secondary imprinting on an artificial object, and (2) within the lengths of exposure used, the capacity to form new filial attachments was not limited, contrary to the prediction of the competitive exclusion model for imprinting. Secondary imprinting was delayed for a longer time when chicks were exposed to the novel imprinting stimulus in an unfamiliar environmental. This indicates that induction of fear in chicks interfered with the occurrence of secondary imprinting. This effect may have contributed to the difference between groups C and Y in the length of delay of secondary imprinting. Possibly, separation from the first stimulus and exposure to the second stimulus was more fearful to C-chicks than to Y-chicks. Behaviour Vol. 125 (1993) pp. 265-281 EFFECTS OF NOVELTY ON TASTE-AVOIDANCE LEARNING IN CHICKS T.J. ROPER School of Biological Sciences, University of Sussex, Brighton BN 9QG, U.K. Five experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of novelty on visually-mediated taste-avoidance learning in domestic chicks. In experiments la and b, chicks were reared with either uncoloured or blue fluid in their home cages, and then required to discriminate between blue and uncoloured fluids that were either palatable or unpalatable (quinine-adulterated). For some chicks the distasteful fluid was novel in appearance, for others it was familiar. In both experiments chicks readily discriminated between a novel unpalatable fluid and a familiar palatable one, but failed to discriminate between a familiar unpalatable fluid and a novel palatable one. This failure to discriminate resulted from avoidance of the palatable fluid. In neither experiment did novelty enhance the rate of avoidance learning. Experiment 2 tested more directly the effect of novelty on speed of avoidance learning. Chicks were reared on either red or blue palatable fluid, then tested with either red or blue distasteful fluid. Avoidance learning was more rapid when the distasteful fluid was novel in colour, in both red-reared and blue-reared chicks. Experiment 3 investigated the inability of chicks to discriminate between a familiar unpalatable fluid and a novel palatable one, demonstrated in experiment 1. Chicks were required to discriminate between different-coloured palatable and unpalatable fluids when both were familiar in appearance (experiment 3a) or when both were novel (experiment 3b). Discrimination occurred in the first case but not in the second. In addition, avoidance learning was slower when both unpalatable fluids were familiar. I conclude that (a) novelty faciliates visually-mediated taste-avoidance learning in chicks and (b) the failure of chicks to discriminate a novel palatable fluid from a familiar unpalatable one depends on the relative novelty of the palatable fluid and not on the relative familiarity of the unpalatable one. The results are discussed in the context of warning coloration and are explained in terms of an interaction between unlearned and learned avoidance tendencies.</page><page sequence="300">942 VOLUME 125 Behaviour Vol. 125 (1993) pp. 283-313 THE CONCEPT AND DEFINITION OF DOMINANCE IN ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR CARLOS DREWS Department of Zoology, Cambridge University, Downing Street, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, U.K. The concept of dominance has contributed greatly to our understanding of social structure in animals. Over the past three decades, however, a variety of concepts and definitions of dominance have been introduced, leading to an ongoing debate about the usefulness and meaning of the concept. Criticisms aimed at one definition of dominance do not necessarilly apply to other definitions. Existing definitions can be structural or functional, refer to roles or to agonistic behaviour, regard dominance as a property of individuals or as an attribute of dyadic encounters, concentrate on aggression or on the lack of it, and be based either on theoretical constructs or on observable behaviour. Thirteen definitions of dominance are reviewed, and their usefulness assessed with respect to their descriptive value. The predictive and explanatory values of definitions are specific to the questions asked in each particular study and are not considered as criteria to judge the usefulness of the dominance concept. By virtue of its high descriptive value, the original definition of dominance by SCHJELDERUPP-EBBE (1922, Z. Psychol. 88: 226-252) emerged as the basis to formulate a structural definition with wide applicability and which reflects the essence of the concept: Dominance is an attribute of the pattern of repeated, agonistic interactions between two individuals, characterized by a consistent outcome in favour of the same dyad member and a default yielding response of its opponent rather than escalation. The status of the consistent winner is dominant and that of the loser subordinate. Dominance status refers to dyads while dominance rank, high or low, refers to the position in a hierarchy and, thus, depends on group composition. Dominance is a relative measure and not an absolute property of individuals. The discussion includes reference to the heritability of dominance, application of dominance to groups rather than individuals, and the role of individual recognition and memory during agonistic encounters.</page><page sequence="301">VOLUME 126 943 Behaviour Vol. 126 (1993) pp. 1-12 THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN MALE SONG FREQUENCY AND PARENTAL CARE IN BLACKCAPS MARIA HOI-LEITNER, HEIDRUN NECHTELBERGER and JOHN DITTAMI Institut fur Zoologie, Universitat Wien, AlthanstraBe 14, A-1090 Vienna, Austria Song rates in male blackcaps were examined over the course of the breeding season and compared with various aspects of mating and later parental behavior in individual birds. Song rates decreased steadily over the breeding season although relative individual rates remained constant. Early territory holders sang more and mated faster than late-comers. Song frequency was positively related to alarm call frequency during nesting but negatively related to male incubation and offspring feeding rates. Surprisingly, under the conditions studied, higher song rates were indicative of higher nesting success. This demonstrates the potential role of song frequency in the advertisement of territorial quality. There may well be either environmentally dependent differences in parental care as adaptations to temperature, food or predation pressure or simply a trade-off for males between singing and parental care, where early arriving males derive greater fitness benefits from singing, while late arriving males benefit more from engaging in parental care.

STEVEN M. EIGER San Francisco University High School, 3065 Jackson Street, San Francisco, California, 94115, U.S.A. In this paper we propose the hypothesis that pathogen-induced host defense responses result in altered host behaviors and enhanced predation. In particular we examine the effects of the acute phase response (whose effects include fever, reduced activity and malaise) on antipredatory behavior in bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) tadpoles. This host response is associated with the preliminary stages of infection with many pathogens yet its behavioral effects have received little attention. Bullfrog tadpoles were injected with alcohol-killed bacteria to induce a response to infection and their ability to detect and avoid capture by predatory salamanders (Taricha granulosa) was explored. We predicted that acute phase responses increase tadpole vulerability to predation by influencing thermoregulatory behavior and their ability to detect, and avoid capture by, salamanders. We found that the sterotypical effects of the acute phase response can lead to increased predation. Malaise affected the refuge seeking behavior of the tadpoles in the presence of salamanders. We suggest that for tadpoles provided with refuges, altered behaviors are a liability. This endogenous response may afford some parasites a potential pathway to their next host.

EVANS Department of Biological Sciences, University of Durham, Durham DH1 3LE, UK Sanderlings Calidris alba were put to flight by walking towards them as they foraged at the water's edge on a sandy beach. Studies of the responses of birds to disturbances have concentrated on the relationship between group size and the distance from the cause of the disturbance at which members of the group take flight (the flight reaction distance). The study of responses to disturbance is extended to consider the frequencies with which birds took flight; their flight directions (whether towards the approacher and then in behind or whether ahead of the approacher); and the distances to which they flew. The nearest birds to the approacher tolerated approaches to well within the range at which the approacher should have been visible. When the nearest birds flew, the likelihood of other birds flying decreased as the distance by which they were further away from the approacher than the nearest birds increased. Birds further away were more likely to fly when more birds flew from nearer to the approacher. The nearest birds tended to fly in behind the approacher while those further away from the approacher flew further ahead. The</page><page sequence="302">944 VOLUME 126 findings suggested that the birds were acting so as to maximize their foraging time by minimizing both the number of flights they made and the distance of each flight, subject to not tolerating close approaches.

CADE Department of Biological Sciences, Brock University, St. Catharines, Ontario Canada L2S 3A1 Intensity of male-male competition and sexual selection were studied in the field cricket, Gryllus penn- sylvanicus, in an outdoor arena at four sex ratios, male-only (5: 0), male-biased 5: 2, unity (5: 5) and female-biased (5: 10). Fighting frequency was highest at male-biased and unity sex ratios. Fighting suc- cess was correlated with male body weight at all sex ratios. Calling duration and scarching distance decreased with increased female numbers. Opportunity for selection was highest at the male-biased and lowest at the female-biased sex ratio. Selection gradients and differentials were calculated and demon- strated that direct and total selection was highly variable and often relaxed. Direct selection favored male weight at the male-biased sex ratio and total selection for weight occurred at unity. There was no selection on male weight at the female-biased sex ratio. Total and direct selection for increased calling duration oc- curred at the male-biased sex ratio. Only total selection for calling duration was found at unity, whereas direct selection acted against calling duration at the female-biased sex ratio. Selection did not act on searching at any sex ratio. Natural variations in sex ratios occur and fluctuations in selection on correlated male traits may maintain additive genetic variation for traits important in male-male competition.

However, pairs initiating compulations showed no assortative pattern: 1) Pairs formed at different times from the deposition of droppings or in different parts of the mating area showed no consistent relationship in size. 2) Successful males in copulation attempts involving several males were larger than in single male attempts but these type of copulation attempts were not more frequent with large females. 3) Female display did not result in assortative mating although displaying females copulated with a relatively larger male than other females. During copulation and oviposition, single males attempted to take-over paired females which resulted in the separation of many initial pairs. Pairs in unsuccessful take-over attempts were size assortatively mated but not in successful take-overs. Pairs flying between droppings were also size assortatively mated suggesting that assortatively mated pairs are more likely to move long distances than other pairs. In addition, density affected pair formation. The difference from the expected female-male size ratio decreased with increasing density among copulating pairs suggesting that assortative mating is more common at high density droppings. Assortative mating in the yellow dung fly therefore results from male aggression against copulating and ovipositing pairs. During take-over attempts non-assortatively mated pairs are likely to be separated. High male density with increased level of male encounter rate is likely to contribute to this process. Behaviour Vol. 126 (1993) pp. 77-96 STARTLE AND HABITUATION RESPONSES OF BLUE JAYS (CYANOCITTA CRISTATA) IN A LABORATORY SIMULATION OF ANTI-PREDATOR DEFENSES OF CATOCALA MOTHS (LEPIDOPTERA: NOCTUIDAE) VICTORIA INGALLS Department of Zoology, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, Massachusetts, 01003, U.S.A. Blue jays were used in laboratory experiments to determine what visual characteristics of Catocala hind- wings are important in eliciting and maintaining startle reactions in avian predators. Hand-reared blue jays, inexperienced with warningly coloured, inedible prey, took significantly longer to touch novel colours</page><page sequence="303">VOLUME 126 945 that possessed bold, black bands than to touch novel, unbanded colours when these discs covered a food reward. Thus, being conspicuous (as opposed to simply being novel) appears to enhance startle reactions. Bold patterns are commonly found on aposematic prey and Catocala hindwings. These same hand-reared birds also tended to take longer to touch novel coloured discs of yellow and red hues as opposed to discs of blue, green, or purple hues. The colours that produced the greatest hesitation are similar to the colours found on Catocala hindwings. Red-yellow colours are also characteristic of aposematic prey. Wild-caught birds took longer to habituate to startling stimuli when presented with several different star- tling disc types during the habituation process. Thus, predator pressure may explain why several different Catocala species with different hindwing colours occur sympatrically. Behaviour Vol. 126 (1993) pp. 97-124 THE BREEDING SYSTEM OF THE THREE-SPINED STICKLEBACK, GASTEROSTEUS ACULEATUS (FORMA LEIURA) WITH REFERENCE TO SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL PATTERNS OF NESTING ACTIVITY SEIICHI MORI Department of Zoology, Faculty of Science, Kyoto University, Japan 1) The breeding success of three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus L., forma leiura) males in a small stream of the Tsuya River, Gifu Prefecture, Central Japan, was studied with reference to timing of nesting initiation, use of space for nesting and social interactions. The observations were made almost daily during March to early July 1988 along the shore at a distance of 1-2 m from the fish and nests. 2) All the males in an enclosed study pool were individually marked (99 males). Furthermore, a total of 67 females were marked and observed weekly. The males were individually observed and their agonistic, courtship and parental behaviour as well as their reproductive success were quantified. Reproductive success of individual male was measured as the number of nests built, the number of successful nests, the number of hatched fry per nest. Nest sites were categorized in six types (A-F) on the basis of the proportion of vegetation cover around the nest and distance from the shore. 3) Body size and environmental factors (water temperature, water depth, changes in water level) were not correlated with reproductive success. Flooding was not a major cause of unsuccessful nesting. The brightness of nuptial colouration at the onset of breeding correlated significantly with individual success. Individual variation in the development of secondary sexual characteristics such as a nuptial colouration may have an important consequence for the lifetime reproductive success of the individuals. There was no relationship between fish density and reproductive success. 4) All males that nested more than once had begun breeding early in the season. The sooner a male started nest-building, the more opportunities he had to complete breeding cycles. 5) After an unsuccessful nest, males were significantly more likely to move their nest sites than after a successful nest. The subsequent nesting cycle was not always successful. 6) There was variation in nest-site location. The spatial pattern of nest distribution was strongly related to the temporal pattern, because the first males which settled, more often built their nests at sites along the shore where the nest was covered on one or two sides by vegetation. The location of nest site was significantly correlated with reproductive success. When males nested in partly concealed places along the shore, they could sometimes obtain a high reproductive success irrespective of the date of breeding initiation. Thus, reproductive success was largely determined by the timing of nest-building and nest position. Behaviour Vol. 126 (1993) pp. 125-136 CONFLICTING DEMANDS IN SAND GOBIES: PREDATORS INFLUENCE REPRODUCTIVE BEHAVIOUR ELISABET FORSGREN and CARIN MAGNHAGEN Department of Zoology, Uppsala University, Villavagen 9, S-752 36 Uppsala, Sweden The effects of predation risk on the reproductive behaviour of male and female sand gobies, Pomatoschistus minutus, were investigated in two separate aquarium studies. In the presence of a predator (cod, Gadus morhua), males decreased their courtship activity while females did not alter their level of activity. In the second study, there was no difference between treatments (with and without predator) in the time from when a female was presented to a male with a nest until spawning took place or in the amount of eggs laid. However, prespawning behaviour differed between the two treatments. When the cod was in sight, both males and females burrowed in the sand more often. In the absence of a predator, pairs</page><page sequence="304">VOLUME 126 spent longer together in the nest before spawning started, and females also inspected the nest alone, which never happened during predator presence. Hence, both sexes make trade-offs between predator avoidance and behaviours associated with mating. Females, however, seem to take higher risks during the courtship phase in order to find a partner compared to males. Behaviour Vol. 126 (1993) pp. 137-154 SEXUAL IMPRINTING IN ZEBRA FINCH MALES: A DIFFERENTIAL EFFECT OF SUCCESSIVE AND SIMULTANEOUS EXPERIENCE WITH TWO COLOUR MORPHS DAVE R. VOS, JOOP PRIJS and CAREL TEN CATE Zoological Laboratory, University of Groningen, P.O. Box 14, 9750 AA Haren, The Netherlands Recent developments in theories of sexual imprinting have emphasized that sexual imprinting may lead to a preference for partners that are slightly different from the stimuli an animal has originally been exposed to. Two mechanisms have been proposed to account for this phenomenon. 1. Separate representation model: This model assumes that as a result of imprinting an internal representation is formed of each individual which a bird experiences during early life. The imprinting process is thought to reduce the responsiveness to novel individuals, whereas at the same time a habituation process would have the effect that individuals resembling these representations too closely are refuted. 2. Mixed representation model: Young birds combine information about different individuals into one internal representation. As a consequence the later preference deviates from the original imprinting stimuli. There is evidence that zebra finch males use a number of stimuli for sexual imprinting, but it is unclear whether and how the way of exposure affects the internal representation. This was examined in zebra finch males that had either successive or simultaneous experience with two different colour morphs of the zebra finch. Each type of experience results in different effects on later preference. Successive experience leads to a preference for both colour morphs. That is, in multiple-stimuli tests with the imprinting morphs and intermediate colour morphs, males with successive experience showed a preference for both imprinting morphs. Simultaneous experience with both morphs does not lead to a double preference but to a preference for the colour morph of the mother. Comparison with the control groups revealed that males raised by mixed pairs had learned to suppress sexual responses to individuals of their father's morph. This implies that zebra finch males learn to discriminate male versus female conspecifics on morphological features during the time course of sexual imprinting. The results of neither type of exposure gave evidence for the formation of mixed representations, as was indicated by the lack of sexual interest which double imprinted males showed for intermediates between both morphs. It is suggested that the way information is stored during imprinting can better be viewed within the context of distributed representation models. Behaviour Vol. 126 (1993) pp. 155-170 NICTATION BEHAVIOUR AND ITS ECOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS IN THE HOST SEARCH STRATEGIES OF ENTOMOPATHOGENIC NEMATODES (HETERORHABDITIDAE AND STEINERNEMATIDAE) JAMES F. CAMPBELL and RANDY GAUGLER Department of Entomology, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ 08903-0231, USA Entomopathogenic nematodes (Heterorhabditidae and Steinerematidae) are insect parasites that appear to use both cruising and ambushing search strategies. Cruising species Heterorhabditis bacteriophora, Steinernemafeltiae, and S. glaseri spent more time crawling (88.8, 80.3, and 92.5% of observation period, respectively) and therefore traveled farther (22.4, 18.6, and 24.3 mm, respectively) and searched a larger area (18.3, 13.7, and 26.6 mm2, respectively) than ambushing species. Ambusher species S. carpocapsae and S. scapterisci traveled shorter distances (4.8 and 4.7 mm, respectively) and searched smaller areas (3.0 and 2.5 mm2, respectively) because they spent most of the observation period nictating (77.5 and 78.2%, respectively). Nictating infective juveniles raise greater than 95% of their body off the substrate and maintain a straight posture. A nictating species S. carpocapsae was up to 43 times as effective at finding mobile insect hosts compared to a non-nictating species H. bacteriophora. When unable to nictate host-finding of mobile insects declined from 35.7 ± 7.19 to 3.9 ± 1.11 infective juveniles per host. Nictation, by reducing the surface tension forces holding the nematode to the substrate, can increase the nematodes ability to attach to passing insects. S. carpocapsae also tended to search more effectively along a surface than through a matrix. Although entomopathogenic nematodes have a broad potential host 946</page><page sequence="305">VOLUME 126 947 range, differences in search behavior may result in a narrower actual host range. Ambushers being more specialized for mobile insects on the soil surface and cruisers for more sedentary and/or subterranean insects. Behaviour Vol. 126 (1993) pp. 171-190 DOES PARTICIPATION IN COALITIONS INFLUENCE DOMINANCE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG MALE BONNET MACAQUES? JOAN B. SILK Department of Anthropology, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90024, USA SILK @anthro.sscnet.ucla.edu DE WAAL (1982) has observed that male chimpanzees use coalitions to manipulate the ranks of their rivals and enhance their own dominance relationships. Here, I investigate the possibility that male bonnet macaques, who frequently intervened in contest among unrelated adult males, also used coalitions to alter their own dominance relationships and/or manipulate the dominance positions of other males. Male bonnet macaques frequently form coalitions in support of other males. Although the rank ordering among males changed during the study period, coalitions did not seem to consistently influence the rank of males who received support or the ranks of males who provided support. Coalitions did not systematically support or disrupt the established dominance order, as males consistently supported initiators against recipients. The tendency to support initiatiors was influenced to some extent by the outcome of the original encounter and the rank order among the opponent. Thus, these data provide no systematic support for the hypothesis that males achieved consistent political objectives when they participated in coalitions. Behaviour Vol. 126 (1993) pp. 191-218 CHANGES IN FEMALE BREEDING BEHAVIOUR ACROSS THE OVULATORY CYCLE IN THE BROOK STICKLEBACK, CULAEA INCONSTANS (KIRTLAND) DEBORAH A. MCLENNAN Department of Zoology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S IAI and Royal Ontario Museum, Department of Ichthyology and Herpetology, Toronto, Ontario M5S 2C6 In this paper I investigate the changes in female Culaea inconstans behaviour at different stages of the ovulatory cycle in response to the presentation of a courting male and an ovulated female intruder. These experiments reveal that female brook sticklebacks display a complex repertoire of behaviours including all of the threat displays commonly described for male gasterosteids. On spawning days, females direct more nudges, bites, broadside displays, head down displays and redirected bites towards an intruding female, and spend more time engaged in hovering, ground head-up courtship, and near, an intruding male. The interspawning interval in females is accompanied by a surge of aggression towards males. In essence, females show a fluctuation in behavioural intensities that mirrors their ovulatory cycle when interacting with males, but show no such cycling during interactions with other females. At the population level female behaviour is thus more predictable when the intruder is a male than when the intruder is another female. At the individual level, however, a female's responses to another female are tightly correlated across her breeding cycle. Aggressive fish spend more time near the intruding female and less time in the plants on all days of their spawning cycle than their less aggressive counterparts, who displayed a strong tendency to flee, S-displaying either during the retreat or from the safety of the plants. Correlations between behaviours are more susceptible to underlying ovulatorty cycle when the intruder is a male. Aggressive fish spend more time near the intruding male only during the interspawning interval. Behaviour Vol. 126 (1993) pp. 219-246 PLAYFIGHTING IN CAPTIVE RED-NECKED WALLABIES, MACROPUS RUFOGRISEUS BANKSIANUS DUNCAN M. WATSON and DAVID B. CROFT School of Biological Science, University of New South Wales, P.O. Box 1, Kensington, New South Wales, Australia, 2033 The structure and development of playfighting in captive red-necked wallabies, Macropus rufogriseus banksianus, was studied over a 2.5 year period.</page><page sequence="306">948 VOLUME 126 An ethogram of 21 acts was established. Playfighting involved acts from agonistic, affiliative and sexual contexts. The sequential organisation of acts was highly non-random in both intra- and inter-individual structure. Sequence analysis grouped acts into 3 sub-systems: those associated with high (central act: Spar) and low (central act: Paw) intensity bouts of fighting; and those associated with initiation, termination or interbout behaviour. Wallabies playfought at varying intensities ranging from high intensity Sparring matches to low intensity bouts of Pawing coupled with frequent and prolonged periods of affiliative interactions. A third type of playfighting, refusal playfights, was of short duration and was probably failed playfight initiations. There was considerable repetition of acts and sequences of acts, and play-partners interacted in a highly mutual manner. Some acts (Skip, side and chest Autogroom, and Shake) were performed in an apparently exaggerated manner and may have had a communicative function. There was noticable restraint used in the performance of Kicking during playfights compared to that seen in serious fights. The goal of playfighting was either to gain unrestricted grooming access to an opponent's throat or to force an opponent off-balance causing it to retreat. Males of any age playfought more often than females; playfighting in females was very rare. Wallabies engaged in playfights soon after they first began to leave their mother's pouch. Three phases of playfight development in males were identified. The first was an early phase of vigorous play that ended about the time wallabies were weaned. The second phase commenced after weaning and continued until after sexual maturity. It was a transitional period of increasing instability in playfight relations manifested as shorter playfights and more refusal playfights. The final phase was characterised by low intensity playfighting and was typical of older adult males. The design of playfighting and age/sex differences in its performance were used to consider the relative importance of motor training, socialisation and assessment of fighting skills as benefits of playfighting. Most evidence favours motor training as the most important benefit, particularly for high intensity play- fighting. For low intensity playfights motor training was not completely satisfactory as the main benefit. It was possible that low intensity playfights gave a different type of motor training than high intensity playfights. Developmental changes in the type of playfighting performed also suggest that either the mo- tor training benefits a wallaby required from play changes with age, or there were age-related changes in the function of playfighting. Neither socialisation or assessment of fighting skills seem to be major benefits of playfighting in the wallabies. The similarities between playfighting in the wallabies and play in better studied taxa (i.e. eutherians), and between wallaby playfighting and the descriptions given in the macropodid literature of prolonged, resource-unrelated serious fights are considered. It was concluded that at least some of the fights of macropodids reported in the literature were misclassed playfights. Behaviour Vol. 126 (1993) pp. 247-290 WHY DOES THE TYPICALLY MONOGAMOUS OYSTERCATCHER (HAEMATOPUS OSTRALEGUS) ENGAGE IN EXTRA-PAIR COPULATIONS? D. HEG, B.J. ENS and J.P. KRUIJT Zoological Laboratory, University of Groningen, Kerklaan 30, 9751 NN Haren, The Netherlands T. BURKE and L. JENKINS Department of Zoology, University of Leicester, Leicester LEI 7RH, UK (1) We attempted to identify the possible costs and benefits of Extra-Pair Copulations (EPCs) from field observations on a colour-marked population of Oystercatchers, a long lived monogamous species, where male and female share parental care and territory defence. (2) Despite our broad definition of EPCs, only 7.0% of successful copulations by male breeders and 5.1% of successful copulations by female breeders were classified as EPCs. (3) Many pairs first copulated more than 2 months before egg-laying. The rate at which breeders engaged in Within-Pair Copulations (WPCs) was highest in the month preceding egg-laying: almost 1 copulation per hour during low tide. Males were increasingly likely to initiate WPCs close to the period of egg-laying. Once the clutch was complete copulation rates dropped to near zero. (4) Most EPCs were observed well before egg-laying. In the month preceding and including egg-laying only 3.3% of all successful copulations by females were EPCs. DNA-fingerprinting confirmed that of 65 chicks (from 26 clutches), only 1 was not fathered by the male partner, but by a neighbouring male, which was seen to copulate with the female before egg-laying. Thus, extra-pair paternity was extremely rare, comprising 1.5% of all chicks. Fingerprinting provided no evidence for intraspecific brood parasitism or quasi-parasitism.</page><page sequence="307">VOLUME 126 949 (5) Members of new pairs (a minority in the population) were observed to copulate with more mates than were members of old pairs, for the same number of copulations observed. (6) Two case studies suggested that EPCs by males and females of old pairs may be attempts to change mate. One female switched to a new mate after 2 years of EPCs with this bird, while the other female is expected to switch to a neighbouring male in 1992, after 3 years of EPCs with this neighbour. (7) The majority of EPCs by male breeders were in their own territory, while female breeders more often moved to the territory of the male, often the neighbour. This sex difference resembles the sex difference in breeding dispersal: female breeders are more likely to switch territory when switching mate (ENS et al., 1993). (8) Male breeders whose mate was absent sometimes evicted soliciting female intruders instantly. This suggest that EPCs were not necessarily beneficial, even when there was no apparent risk of a penalty by the mate. (9) If EPCs are primarily attempts to change mate, we predict an increase in the probability of mate change when an individual has engaged in EPCs in the previous year. We surmise that we failed to establish this relationship, because our record of EPCs was incomplete and because attempts at mate change apparently often failed due to intra-sexual competition. Behaviour Vol. 126 (1993) pp. 291-308 A MODEL OF FEATHER PECKING DEVELOPMENT WHICH RELATES TO DUSTBATHING IN THE FOWL KLAUS S. VESTERGAARD and LONE LISBORG Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University, Department of Animal Science and Animal Health, 13 Bulowsvej, DK-1870 Frederiksberg C (Copenhagen) Denmark A model which explains feather pecking development as a process by which feathers become treated as a substrate for dustbathing was tested. Chicks kept in wire floored cages were trained from day 3 of life to dustbathe during one hour daily training sessions on either a skin with feathers or on sand. By day 25-26 sand and feather trained chicks dustbathed equally much during training. Feather trained chicks, however, pecked and scratched less. During 3 consecutive dustbathing tests with feathers and sand presented simultaneously, and, in between tests, with additional experience of the new substrate, feather trained chicks increased their pecking and scratching until test 3 where they pecked and scratched the sand as frequently as sand trained chicks. However, they pecked significantly more at feathers than the sand trained chicks and on average still performed 52% of their dustbathing on feathers. Furthermore, the number of pecks at feathers during the last dustbathing choice test was significantly correlated with the percent of dustbathing (vertical wing-shaking) on feathers. The total number of vertical wing-shakes did not change significantly and was similar to that of sand trained chicks. Sand trained chicks never performed dustbathing on feathers and the experience of feathers did not result in significant quantitative changes in any of the behaviours. In the tests the latency to the first vertical wing-shake increased significantly in feather trained chicks after experience of sand. Experience of feathers, however, had no such effect in sand trained chicks. Finally, the progression over the hour of the last training session and of the 3rd choice test of vertical wing-shaking was slower in feather trained than in sand trained chicks. In conclusion, the proposed model was confirmed by the results: pecking at feathers and dustbathing on feathers persisted and remained related in feather trained chicks although their pecking and scratching predominantly became directed to sand. Furthermore, as expected from the model experience of feathers had no effect on sand trained chicks. It is suggested that an association between dustbathing and feather pecking might be prevented by formation of a strong association between dustbathing and attractive stimuli like sand and peat as early as possible.</page><page sequence="308">950 VOLUME 127 Behaviour Vol. 127 (1993) pp. 1-20 PARENT-YOUNG VOCAL COMMUNICATION IN EARED GREBES DEBORAH BUITRON and GARY L. NUECHTERLEIN Zoology Department, North Dakota State University, Fargo, ND 58105 USA In a series of experiments, we played eared grebe (Podiceps nigricollis) and western grebe (Aechmophorus occidentalis) food calls in random order to eared grebe chicks brooded under the back-feathers of their parents. We examined the responses of chicks that were 12-23 h, I day, and 2-3 days old. Over the first 3 days, there was a significant increase in responsiveness (poking out the head and begging) to the parental food call. In similar experiments using the alarm call, eared grebe chicks with their heads out responded strongly to their own species' calls by ducking their heads beneath the back-feathers. Cross-fostered eared and western grebe chicks rarely responded to food calls of their own species, but responded vigorously to their foster species' calls. On the other hand, a cross-fostered eared grebe chick showed strong responses to the alarm calls of its own species, even though its foster parents were not using that type of call. This chick had not learned to respond to its foster species' alarms. Cross-fostered western grebe chicks responded to the alarms of both species, even though they were unlikely to have heard their own species' calls. Whether their alarm responses to both species was a manifestation of incomplete learning or of an absence of species specificity unaffected by early experiences remains to be determined. If learning was involved, it appeared to occur at a slower rate than did responses to the food calls of foster parents. The importance of learning appeared to vary considerably between the two types of calls, and the advan- tages of this are discussed. Although young chicks respond to the food and alarm calls from any adult of their species, playback experiments using the advertising calls of adults suggest that older grebe chicks can learn to individually identify their parents by the time they begin swimming on their own. Behaviour Vol. 127 (1993) pp. 21-36 SPIDER FLEXIBLY CHOOSES AGGRESSIVE MIMICRY SIGNALS FOR DIFFERENT PREY BY TRIAL AND ERROR ROBERT R. JACKSON Department of Zoology, University of Canterbury, Christchurch 1, New Zealand R. STIMSON WILCOX Department of Biology, State University of New York at Binghamton, New York, U.S.A. Portia is a jumping spider that invades other spiders' webs, makes vibratory signals that deceive the resident spider (aggressive mimicry), then attacks and eats the spider. Portia exploits a wide range of prey-spider species. Evidence is provided from observation and experimentation that Portia uses a trial-and-error method as part of its strategy for deriving appropriate signals for different prey. To use this method, Portia first broadcasts an array of different signals, then narrows to particular signals as a consequence of feedback from the prey spider. Feedback can be web vibration or seeing spider move, or both. This appears to be an example of deception involving at least a limited form of learning, an uncommon phenomenon in invertebrates. Behaviour Vol. 127 (1993) pp. 37-48 TRANSMISSION OF FRIGHT REACTION BETWEEN DIFFERENT SPECIES OF FISH JENS KRAUSE Department of Zoology, University of Cambridge, Downing Street, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, U.K. Awareness of predators in group living species can be brought about in two ways. Either an individual directly senses a predator itself or it gets indirect information by monitoring other group members which have detected a predator. In this paper, I demonstrate such information transfer between two species of fish. A mixed shoal of chub (Leuciscus cephalus) and sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) was presented with Schreckstoff, an alarm substance, wide-spread among cyprinid fishes. Sticklebacks are not sensitive to Schreckstoff and their behaviour was observed in the presence of naive and habituated chub. Naive chub responded to Schreckstoff with a strong and immediate fright reaction whereas habituated chub did not. Sticklebacks only displayed a fright reaction when associated with naive chub, which indicates that</page><page sequence="309">VOLUME 127 951 they can obtain information about a potential predator threat by monitoring the behaviour of the chub. This result suggests that shoaling with Schreckstoff-sensitive cyprinids can provide a benefit for sticklebacks. Behaviour Vol. 127 (1993) pp.49-66 HELPING BEHAVIOUR IN COOPERATIVELY-BREEDING GREEN WOODHOOPOES: SELECTED OR UNSELECTED TRAIT? MORNE A. DU PLESSIS Percy FitzPatrick Institute of African Ornithology, University of Cape Town, Rondebosch 7700, South Africa 1. I experimentally examined components of the stimulus-response mechanism and their effects on feeding rates to nestlings in cooperative singular-breeding green woodhoopoes Phoeniculus purpureus, and showed that both auditory and visual stimuli played important roles. 2. Breeding status did not influence the way in which adults responded to the various stimuli. 3. Adult woodhoopoes fed foreign nestlings which had been transferred as frequently and with as much food as their own nestlings. 4. Observational evidence from two different studies showed that recent-immigrant nonbreeders provided young with as much food as other established nonbreeders. Thus, there is no evidence that nonparental feeding behaviour is related to nest-site specificity, kin discrimination, or prior association with breeders in this species. 5. Demographic data gathered over a period of eight years (1981-1989) for a total of 258 "group years" suggested that helpers did not gain any direct or indirect fitness benefits as a result of their nonparental feeding contributions to young per se. Behaviour Vol. 127 (1993) pp. 67-104 DOMINANCE RANK AND ACCESS TO ESTROUS FEMALES IN MALE SAVANNA BABOONS JOHN B. BULGER Division of Environmental Studies, University of California, Davis, CA 95616, U.S.A. Data on sexual consortships in a troop of chacma baboons are analyzed in relation to a priority-of-access model and to critical demographic and social variables. The data show a robust association between adult male rank and mating success, and a close approximation to priority-of-access type mating. Principal findings were: (1) Mating activity peaked during the four most likely days of ovulation, and was greater on conceptive than on nonconceptive cycles. (2) On each day of estrus, males of the alpha rank consorted more frequently than did males of other ranks for both classes of cycles. (3) Moreover, on each day of estrus, alpha males consorted at higher rates on conceptive cycles than they did on nonconceptive cycles. (4) Male dominance rank and consorting success were positively correlated, including a perfect rank correlation on conceptive cycles. (5) Mean consort duration was also positively correlated with male dominance rank. (6) The most striking aspect of male mating patterns was the predominance of alpha males. Male domi- nance rank and consort success were in qualitative but not perfect quantitative agreement with predictions of a priority-of-access model. Alpha males consorted on 86% of the days and 94% of the conceptive cycles they were expected to, and were selective of conceptive over nonconceptive cycles. (7) The size of the adult male cohort had no effect on the consort success of alpha males. (8) Alpha male consort success was reduced during intervals when two or more females were synchro- nously in estrus. Inconsistent results from other savanna baboon field studies have often led to the conclusion that dominance rank is not important as a determinant of male mating success. Analysis of the literature indicates that some of the reported variability among studies is explained by factors that are associated with differences in group demography. In addition, the importance of male dominance rank has often been treated superficially in discussions emphasizing alternative mating tactics, due in part to the uneven representation of published accounts emerging from individual study sites. I conclude that there is a general, underlying relationship between male dominance rank and access to mates in savanna baboons.</page><page sequence="310">952 VOLUME 127 Dominance rank is inarguably the primary determinant of mating success among high-ranking males, while the mating success of subordinate males is determined both by rank and the extent to which coalitions are expressed in the group. Rank/mating measures tend to be strongest in the chacma subspecies, among which male-male coalitions over mates are unknown. Male-male competition based in both solo and coalitional tactics appears to dominate the expression of individual partner preferences.

GELOWITZ, ALICIA MATHIS and R. JAN F. SMITH Department of Biology, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan S7N OWO, Canada Chemical recognition of familiar or unfamiliar predators may allow prey to detect predators under condi- tions in which vision is of limited utility. In laboratory tests, brook stickleback (Culaea inconstans) from a pike-allopatric population responded to chemical stimuli from northern pike (Esox lucius) with an ap- propriate anti-predator behaviour (decreased activity) only when the stimulus was obtained from pike that had eaten conspecific stickleback. In contrast, stickleback from a pike-sympatric population exhibited a fright response to chemical stimuli from pike that had eaten only heterospecific fish prey. Our study is the first to demonstrate chemosensory recognition of predators by a stickleback (family Gasterosteidae). Our results further indicate that predator diet influences chemosensory recognition of unfamiliar predators and that individuals from a predator-sympatric population can recognize predators even when the predator's recent diet has not included conspecific fish prey.

PORTER, PASCAL POINDRON, PIERRE ORGEUR, PATRICK CHESNE and NATI POULIN Laboratoire de Comportement Animal, URA CNRS 1291, INRA, 37380 Nouzilly, France To assess the underlying bases of the phenotypic traits by which lambs are recognized, ewes' responses to both dizygotic and monozygotic twins were observed. When tested several hours post-partum, ewes discriminated between their familiar lamb and its same-sex dizygotic twin that had been isolated at birth. The latter twins were nonetheless treated more positively than were unfamiliar alien lambs. A similar pattern of results was obtained for ewes tested with familiar and isolated monozygotic twins, and an unfamiliar alien lamb. To assess the possible influence of the differential pre-test treatments of familiar and isolated twins and the role of maternal chemical labels in offspring discrimination, the above experiments were replicated with the familiar lamb confined to a mesh cage that prevented maternal licking and nursing. Although isolated dizygotic twins were accepted to a lesser extent than their caged familiar twins, levels of maternal acceptance/rejection did not differ between the isolated twins and unfamiliar alien lambs. In contrast, isolated monozygotic twins were not treated differently than their caged familiar twins, but they were nonetheless distinguished from unfamiliar alien young. These latter data tentatively suggest that ewes may have discerned a greater resemblance between familiar and isolated MZ twins than between DZ twins of these two categories. It therefore appears that lambs' individually distinctive signatures reflect an interaction between genetically influenced processes and non-genetic factors (e.g. environmental or metabolic).</page><page sequence="311">VOLUME 127 953 Behaviour Vol. 127 (1993) pp. 141-174 MALE AND FEMALE MATING COMPETITION IN WOLVES: FEMALE SUPPRESSION VS. MALE INTERVENTION RUUD DERIX, JAN VAN HOOFF and HAN DE VRIES Ethology &amp; Socio-ecology, Utrecht University, Pb 80.086, 3508 TB Utrecht, The Netherlands JOEP WENSING Burgers Zoo Arnhem, Schelmseweg 85, 6861 SH Arnhem, The Netherlands The social organization of wolves is characterised by strong pairbond associations. Groups may consist of a mating couple and their remaining offspring or of an association of potentially reproductive adults. When a pack consists of several adults, intrasexual mating competition and intersexual partner preference are expected to play an important role in the establishment of sexual relationships. Data from the wild show that as a rule only one female in a pack gives birth. Female suppression is assumed to prevent the other pack members from breeding. Our main interest was to elucidate the proximate behavioural mechanisms by which the socio-sexual relationships are structured in times of the mating season. Special attention was paid to the influence of differences in dominance status and sex on the competitive interactions between pack members. From 1977 to 1985 we studied the social behaviour of wolves in and around the mating season at Burger's Zoo in Arnhem (The Netherlands) by means of detailed observations on two wolf packs. Together with a general rise in frequency of (sexuo-affiliative) interactions we observed an increase in general aggression and in the frequency of interventions during the mating season. Our results reveal certain differences in male and female mating strategies. 1) Separative interventions were observed predominantly in males and were directed against male-female sexual interactions, while such interventions by females were less apparent. 2) Males showed a high frequency of intrasexual aggression but only during the mating season. By contrast, females showed less intrasexual aggression, and instead, showed a high level of intrasexual dominance display, especially the a-female, and they did so both in and outside the mating season. 3) Males tended to intervene in especially those intersexual contacts in which their own preferred female was involved, whereas the intolerance of the a-female was more general, i.e. it was shown with respect to all manifestations of other females. These patterns clearly explain why in free nature wolf social organization tends towards a multi-male uni-female system in which the non-dominant males have little chance of sexual contact, but are generally tolerated as helpers in brood care. In conclusion, male competition was comparatively more context-related while female competition took the form of unprovoked hostility.

PIPER, MANEE ARCHAWARANON and ELIZABETH WYRICK THOMPSON Department of Biology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-3280, U.S.A. Singing by white-throated sparrows Zonotrichia albicollis during the winter in natural situations occurred most frequently among birds with high rank in a dominance hierarchy. Genetic morph, age and sex had no significant influence on singing during winter. Among testosterone-implanted birds in small groups in large aviaries, dominance rank strongly influenced singing. Testosterone-treated birds with top rank sang most frequently, those with second rank less, and those with lower rank never. As a testosterone- treated bird's rank changed in the course of regroupings with new opponents, its frequency of singing also changed. Dominance in a group thus interacted with testosterone to promote singing. In addition, grouped birds in May before treatment with testosterone did not sing. As a consequence, it seems likely that the normal seasonal development of territorial behavior and singing involves cascading interactions of endocrine states and social circumstances.</page><page sequence="312">954 VOLUME 127 Behaviour Vol. 127 (1993) pp. 191-230 AGE AND CONTEXT AFFECT THE STEREOTYPIES OF CAGED MINK GEORGIA J. MASON Sub-department of Animal Behaviour, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB3 8AA The effects of age and context on the stereotypies of caged mink were examined in order to assess .the developmental changes undergone by the behaviour, and to find context-specificity that might suggest its motivational bases. Caged mink perform stereotypies consisting of a variety of movements, most commonly pacing and rearing, running in and out of the nestbox, and stationary head-twirling or nodding. Stereotypies are largely performed as feeding-time approaches, and many mink do not show them at all once fed. Stereotypies become more frequent and less variable with age; and in adults, individuals with the highest levels of stereotypy show the least variable forms of the behaviour and are most likely to perform it in more than one context, i.e. not solely in the pre-feeding period. These data suggest that mink stereotypies become 'established' with age, in the manner described for stereotypies in other species. However, the behaviour of kits does not follow the pattern seen in adults: kits performing stereotypies in more than one context do not have particularly high levels of the behaviour, nor are their stereotypies particularly unvarying. In addition, post-feeding stereotypies are commonly shown even by very young animals. Thus it cannot be the case that mink stereotypies are performed first in the pre-feeding situation and only later in other contexts via a process of emancipation. This conclusion is further supported by the finding that the forms of the behaviour often differ pre- and post-feeding. The specific forms and contexts of mink stereotypies suggest certain motivational bases for the behaviour. The rise in stereotypies as feeding time approaches and the sustained levels seen when the animals are not fed indicate hunger as an important factor, and in one dataset, the individuals whose stereotypies were solely pre-feeding used the most Longitudinal movements (i.e. pacing and its variants). This suggests that stereotypies, and pacing movements in particular, may stem from appetitive, food-searching behaviour. In contrast, Stationary movements such as head-twirling are performed more in the hours after feeding, and in one group of mink their levels declined over the pre-feeding period as feeding time approached. The physical appearance of such movements suggests they might be derived from attempts to escape the cage. Thus mink stereotypies are probably seen in a range of contexts because they develop from several different behaviour patterns, with different motivational bases. The link, in adults, between performance in this range of contexts and the degree of establishment of the behaviour may be explained in one of two ways. In one adult group the data suggest that animals with stereotypy in more than one context incorporate the typically post-feeding Stationary movements into their pre-feeding behaviour, as if emancipation of this movement had occurred. However, data from the other adult group do not support this hypothesis, and the degree of establishment and the number of contexts in which stereotypies are performed may not be causally linked at all, but instead the independent products of individual propensities to develop stereotypic behaviour. Sex and site differences have yet to be fully explained. Females show consistently higher levels of stereotypy than males, as if perhaps they find the environment more frustrating. There are also enormous differences in the frequency and incidence of the behaviour on the two different sites studied.

BYRNE Scottish Primate Research Group, University of St Andrews, School of Psychology, St Andrews, Fife KY16 9JU, Scotland, e-mail rwbst-andrews.ac.uk A formal notation is argued to be useful in representing theories of complex animal behaviour. This "production system" approach, originally derived from artificial intelligence, is explained with a series of examples of tactical deception in primates. These examples are controversial, since they might suggest intentionality and thinking in non-humans, and their interpretation is not straightforward. The ease of representing competing explanations of sophisticated behaviour (for instance those used in behaviourist psychology, animal ethology, and cognitive science) in the single formalism of production systems, may eventually aid a rapprochement between disciplines with interests in the evolution of intelligence.</page><page sequence="313">VOLUME 127 955 Behaviour Vol. 127 (1993) pp. 247-264 HABITAT SHIFT AFTER EXPERIMENTAL REMOVAL OF THE BIGGER SPECIES IN SYMPATRIC CTENOMYS TALARUM AND CTENOMYS AUSTRALIS (RODENTIA: OCTODONTIDAE) ALDO I. VASSALLO Departamento de Biologia, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Universidad Nacional de Mar del Plata, Casilla de Correo 1245 - (7600) Mar del Plata, Argentina A removal trapping experiment was conducted in the field to investigate if microhabitat choice and population characteristics of Ctenomys talarum are affected by the bigger, dominant Ctenomys australis, in a zone where these subterranean rodent species are geographically sympatric. As reported previously by other authors, the species were distributed in a habitat segregation pattern which characterized the initial state, prior to C. australis removal. I detected a significant habitat shift-that is, changes in microhabitat choice by C. talarum individuals-in response to C. australis removal. However, it is remarkable that this only occurred after one. year of continuous removal of C. australis, and was restricted to a very small expansion by C. talarum into the fringe of the area previously occupied by the dominant species. In addition, a slight increase of the C. talarum population density took place which was possibly due to the absence of the other species. It is suggested that the microhabitat typical of C. australis (with deeper, more friable soil and less vegetation) could be suboptimal and thus unpreferred for C. talarum. If the pre-experimental C. talarum population was satiated to its carrying capacity, it is possible that the small number of C. talarum individuals-mostly subadults-had invaded areas previously occupied by C. australis because they had no other choice than a suboptimal habitat. No substantial changes were detected in other population characteristics (sex ratio, age structure, distance between individuals) which were very similar to that in a control area. Interspecific interactions and displacement by the bigger C. australis could be significant but nonetheless marginal in sustaining the pattern of microhabitat segregation between the species. Difference in habitat preference, linked with species differences in body size and colour, are probably of much greater importance. Behaviour Vol. 127 (1993) pp. 265-278 INTRASPECIFIC VARIATION IN COURTSHIP AND COPULATION FREQUENCY: AN EFFECT OF MISMATCH IN PARTNER ATTRACTIVENESS? MARION PETRIE Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford, OXI 3PS FIONA M. HUNTER Department of Zoology, University of Cambridge, Downing Street, Cambridge, CB2 3EJ The aim of this paper is to present a verbal theoretical model that could account for the among pair variability in courtship and copulation behaviour that occurs both during and after pair formation in socially monogamous species. We assume that copulation acts to prevent mate loss, by reducing the availability of an individual to other potential partners. Variation in copulation and courtship frequency then arises as a result of variation in the risk of mate loss. Because of the constraints on free or ideal choice, pairs will form in which it may be possible for one individual to improve upon the quality of its partner. In a mismatched pair it will pay the poorer quality mate to guard the higher quality individual and prevent it from leaving to pair with a better quality mate. The poor quality individual will therefore solicit copulations at a high frequency while it's partner may not always respond. We predict that high levels of courtship and solicitation will relate to a high risk of mate loss and that a lack of response by a partner will relate to the potential opportunities it has to improve on partner quality. Our thesis is that variation in mating behaviour arises as a result of any deviations from assortative mating that may exist in a population.</page><page sequence="314">956 VOLUME 127 Behaviour Vol. 127 (1993) pp. 279-288 FEMALE ATTRACTION BEHAVIOUR OF RADIO TAGGED POLYTERRITORIAL PIED FLYCATCHER MALES OSMO RATTI and PIRKKO SIIKAMAKI Department of Biology, University of Jyvaskyla, Yliopistonkatu 9, SF-40100 Jyvaskyla, Finland Polygynous mating is costly for pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca) females. Thus, females have a good reason to attempt to avoid mating with already mated polyterritorial males. One cue to disclose a male's mating status is his behaviour. The behaviour of polyterritorial and unmated males was studied by radio tagging that allows accurate recording of male movements. While attracting a secondary female polyterritorial males spent significantly less time on the secondary territory than did unmated males on their single territory. Polyterritorial males also tended to have lower song rates. When a female appeared on the secondary territory of polyterritorial males, they increased the proportion of time spent there, and as a result the difference between polyterritorial and unmated males was not significant. A female might potentially be able to estimate a male's mating status on basis of male presence at the territory, but only if she does not reveal herself. Still, the variation and overlap in male behaviour between mating categories may make it difficult for her to obtain reliable information about the mating status of a male.

CHRISTIAN, J. OSTLER and T.K. SCHMID School of Biological Sciences, University of Sussex, Brighton BN1 9QG, U.K. Badgers (Meles meles) defecate, urinate and scent mark at latrines which seem to have a territorial function. The main aim of the present study was to compare defecation patterns at boundary and hinterland latrines, in order to test the hypothesis that these two types of latrine have a similar function. We investigated latrine use by means of a year-round survey of all the latrines in 7 badger territories, by bait-marking of 15 territories, and by monitoring latrine use in 6 radio-collared badgers belonging to three social groups. The spatial distribution of latrines within a territory was bimodal, with the greatest densities of latrines close to the outside, and close to the centre, of the territory respectively. Boundary latrines were larger and more consistently used than hinterland latrines, but these differences could be accounted for by the fact that boundary latrines are visited by the members of more than one social group. Defecation at latrines was subject to seasonal variation, with a major peak in latrine use in spring and a minor peak in autumn. The spring peak was largely attributable to an increase in the use of hinterland latrines, the autumn peak to an increase in the use of boundary latrines. Males visited boundary latrines considerably more often than did females, but both sexes visited hinterland latrines equally often. Overmarking occurred equally often at both types of latrine and involved animals from the same as well as from different groups, but there was a significant tendency for more between-group than within-group overmarking. Overmarking occurred mainly on fresh, as opposed to old, faeces deposits. The sex and seasonal differences in use of boundary latrines suggest that these function at least partly as a form of mate-guarding, to deter neighbouring males from entering a territory for mating purposes. It is less clear why females mark at hinterland latrines. One possibility, consistent with the observed spatial distribution of hinterland latrines, is that they function to defend the main burrow system, which is used for breeding; another is that they carry information about social status. Overmarking probably serves to obliterate the marks of competitors, which are members of neighbouring social groups in the case of boundary latrines, but may be members of the same social group in the case of hinterland latrines. We conclude that previous ideas about the function of territoriality in badgers, and about the information conveyed by latrines, are oversimplified.</page><page sequence="315">VOLUME 127 957 Behaviour Vol. 127 (1993) pp. 309-322 INCUBATION DEVELOPMENT AND ASYNCHRONOUS HATCHING IN JUNGLEFOWL T. MEIJER and I. SIEMERS Dep. of Ethology, Univ. of Bielefeld, P.O. Box 10 01 31, 33501 Bielefeld, Germany In gallinaceous birds and other nidifugous species, it is thought that effective incubation does not start before the last egg is laid, and young hatch synchronously (LACK, 1968). We investigated the egg-laying and nest-attendance pattern of the precocial nidifugous red Burmese Junglefowl Gallus gallus spadiceus, and its consequences for the asynchrony of embryo development and of hatching. Eggs were laid in sequences, followed by pause days. Egg-weight in these sequences decreased by 0.6 g/egg. When laying, females sat in the nest for 1-3 h/day, and attended the nest overnight on days on which the last eggs of a clutch were laid. At the moment the last egg was laid, first eggs were already attended for 40 h (range 16-84 h), which.resulted in extreme developmental asynchrony at the end of laying (measured as the diameter of the area vasculosa). Last eggs of clutches decreased markedly in weight (by more than 1 g/egg) and had shorter incubation times than the heavier first eggs. Eggs hatched asynchronously over a period of 15 h (range 7-33 h) and in the order of laying. The development of incubation behaviour, asynchrony of embryo development and of hatching of the precocial nidifugous Junglefowl, corresponded to a high degree to what is known of altricial species.</page><page sequence="316">958 VOLUME 128 Behaviour Vol. 128 (1994) pp. 1-14 SEX RECOGNITION IN ZEBRA FINCH MALES RESULTS FROM EARLY EXPERIENCE DAVE R. VOS Zoological Laboratory, University of Groningen, P.O. Box 14, 9750 AA Haren, The Netherlands This study investigated whether sexual imprinting plays a role in the recognition of the sex of conspecifics. Subjects were zebra finch males that had been raised with either normal pairs, white pairs or pairs of both morphs. They were tested for their preferences in six two-stimuli tests covering all combinations of both morphs of either sex. Males of all groups showed a clear preference for females of their mother's morph over males of their father's morph. Moreover, a majority of the males from mixed parentage preferred a male of their mother's morph over a female of their father's morph, indicating that morphological characteristics are more important than behavioural differences for discrimination between the sexes. This was confirmed in a subsequent series of tests in which males raised by parents of the white morph, which are sexually dimorphic only in respect to the intensity of the red colour of the bill, were given a choice between a white male with his bill painted orange and a white female with her bill painted red. All males of this group preferred to court the male in this test. In addition to differential responses in a sexual context, males showed discrimination in an aggressive context; that is, most aggression was directed towards stimulus birds resembling the father. The implications of these results for the evolution of sexual dimorphism and sexual selection are considered.

BOAG Department of Biology, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, K7L 3N6, Canada Sexual preferences of adult zebra finches are influenced by early learning of parental characteristics. We studied how imprinting affects the preference of female zebra finches for male beak colour. The beaks of male and female parents were painted, 2-3 days before hatch and thereafter until the young were fledged, as follows: male red, female orange (R-O group); male orange, female red (O-R group); both male and female red (R-R group); or both male and female orange (0-0 group). Females were raised by painted parents until 35 days, then visually isolated from other birds until test at 100 days. In 4-way choice tests using red- and orange-painted stimulus males, females from Groups O-R and R-O chose males with beaks painted the same colour as their father's beak, whereas females from Groups R-R and 0-0 did not. We conclude that preference for male beak colour was acquired only by females reared by parents with unlike, discriminative, beak colours. The results suggest an associative learning basis for sexual imprinting.

The song motifs produced by the birds were compared with those of their tutors or training tapes to infer the time of motif memorization. We found that the starlings continued to memorize and produce new song motifs, both within and between breeding seasons, up to the age of at least 18 months. Not all the new motifs in the repertoires had been recently memorized; in some cases there was an apparent lag of a year and a half between memorization and production. There were no significant differences between live-tutored and tape-tutored groups in the timing of learning or in the</page><page sequence="317">VOLUME 128 959 rate of repertoire turnover (55-92% new motifs in each repertoire sample), although, as we have reported previously, live-tutored birds imitated a greater number of motifs and developed larger repertoires. Behaviour Vol. 128 (1994) pp. 41-64 EXTRA-PAIR COPULATIONS IN THE RED-BILLED GULL: FEMALES WITH HIGH-QUALITY, ATTENTIVE MALES RESIST J.A. MILLS Science and Research Division, Department of Conservation, P.O. Box 10420, Wellington, New Zealand Extra-pair copulation (EPC) and within-pair copulation (WPC) behaviour if red-billed gulls (Larus novae- hollandiae scopulinus) was observed in a breeding colony at Kaikoura Peninsula, New Zealand. Twenty- five females and 19 individually colour-marked males were monitored for six hours per day for twenty days from 20 September to 30 October 1973. Extra-pair copulation attempts were common, amounting to 21% of all copulation attempts, but less than 3% were successful during the fertile period of the female. Ten percent of EPCs were on males. Within-pair mountings were eight times more likely to end in cloa- cal contact than EPCs. Within-pair and EPC attempts occurred throughout the day, but the frequency of WPC attempts increased markedly towards evening, possibly as an adaptation to ensure last-male sperm precedence. Approximately 80% of females, but only 32% of males, were involved in EPC attempts. Mounting within and between pairs increased in frequency about 15 days prior to laying of the first egg. Within-pair copulation attempts ceased abruptly after the first egg was laid, but EPC attempts on the fe- male continued well into incubation and amounted to 1 1% of the total EPC attempts. Seventy-five percent of EPC attempts occurred in the fertile period of the recipient female. Approximately 75% of the EPC attempts by males occurred over a nine-day period; six days prior to and two days after its mate had laid the first egg. No EPC attempts were recorded for males more than seven days after its mate commenced laying. The female had control as to whether the copulation attempt would be successful. In WPC at- tempts the female ended the mount on 72% of the occasions, whereas all EPC attempts were ended by the female. Approximately 91% of within-pair mountings followed some form of courtship feeding dis- play, and in the remaining 9% the female mounted without courtship preliminaries. In contrast, 97% of extra-pair mountings occurred in the absence of courtship displays. On the two instances where prelimi- naries occurred, mounting followed courtship feeding solicitation by the female towards the strange male. Potentially high quality females which were being well provisioned in courtship feeding by their mates were at greater risk from EPCs because they were able to spend more time at the nest site than less well provisioned females. Females which were well fed during courtship feeding resisted all EPC attempts and retained their partner the next breeding season. Poorly courtship fed females divorced the next season. One such female solicited an EPC four days prior to the laying of her first egg. There was no evidence to suggest that males performing EPCs were at risk from being cuckolded and the male partners of fe- males experiencing high numbers of EPCs did not respond to the risk by having more WPCs or having more genital contacts per hour. It is considered that EPCs were not a major feature of the mating sys- tem for the majority of red-billed gulls. The advantages of EPCs were greater for females than for males and the results support the genetic quality hypothesis. Theoretically if males wanted to maximise their fitness they should attempt EPC's on females nesting earlier than themselves, but this only happened on 17% of the EPC attempts. The high number of WPCs, the increase in frequency of copulations in the evening and high courtship feeding rates are measures that help to ensure paternity of the true mate. It is hypothesized that in species like the red-billed gull which have long-term pair-bonds and invest consider- able time and energy in courtship feeding and parental care during incubation and chick rearing it would be more advantageous to strengthen the pair-bond than to philander to increase production. In a mating system such as this, philandering would jeopardize the current reproductive investment and future repro- duction because those which change partners are less productive than those which retain their partners and for those which divorce the probability of breeding the next season is lower than for those which retain pair-bonds (MILLS, unpub. data). More successful breeding occurs if the pair-bond has been established for more than one year (MILLS, unpub. data). Thus, in this mating system the "attentive prosper".</page><page sequence="318">960 VOLUME 128 Behaviour Vol. 128 (1994) pp. 65-102 DYNAMIC PAIR BONDS IN HYLOBATIDS: IMPLICATIONS REGARDING MONOGAMOUS SOCIAL SYSTEMS RYNE PALOMBIT Animal Behvior Group, University of California, Davis, California Descriptions of monogamy in the gibbons (Hylobates spp., Hylobatidae) have generally emphasized fea- tures derived from inference rather than direct observation: 1) adults mate for life; 2) the genetic structure of groups corresponds with a "nuclear family" pattern of parents and their mutual offspring; 3) first mate acquisition is achieved when two newly dispersed, unaccompanied, young adults of opposite sex establish a new pair and territory together. The six-year history of mating associations of adults in three groups of sympatric, wild siamang (Hylobates syndactylus) and three groups of white-handed gibbon (Hylobates lar) at the Ketambe Research Station (Sumatra, Indonesia) challenge the generality of these assumptions. These longitudinal sociodemographic data suggest that gibbon pair bonds are not necessarily life-long and that adults may leave mates permanently or temporarily, sometimes in order to exploit new repro- ductive opportunities. Of 11 heterosexual pair bonds that existed at some time during the study, only two were terminated by death of one adult, whereas five were terminated when one adult left its current mate. In some cases, the "deserting" individual left its mate and joined a neighboring adult of opposite sex who had recently lost its own mate through death or desertion. This turnover in pair bond member- ship generated stable, "non-nuclear" family groups in which the replacement mate was not the parent of the resident nonadults. Mechanisms of mate acquisition observed at Ketambe included two process that may also promote non-nuclear families. A young adult may obtain its first mate by: 1) replacing an adult of the same sex in a neighboring group or in the group in which it resides; 2) establishing a new pair bond (and territory) with another unmated young adult of opposite sex who is, however, accompanied in dispersal by juvenile conspecifics from its group. Finally, observed extra-pair copulations (in siamang) suggested an additional, but as yet unspecified potential for variable relatedness between adult males and resident nonadults. Review of other long-term histories of pair bonds in wild gibbons and of studies of socio-sexual behavior in captivity reinforce the conclusion that the apparent temporal stability and un- derlying behavioral inflexibility of pair bonds has been over-emphasized. Although data on behavior and reproduction are limited, they nevertheless suggest strongly that the mating and social systems of these monogamous primates are considerably more dynamic and complex than previously appreciated.

Six adult females in one group were observed during the non-birth season (no infants) and the birth season when three females had given birth to an infant. During the non-birth season the exchange of grooming and soliciting for it indicated reciprocity between non-kin. During the birth season, however, non-mothers groomed mothers much more than vice versa, and soliciting was shown more by mothers. This is in accord with the hypothesis that grooming is offered in order to be permitted to allomother. In addition, allomothering was often preceded and followed by grooming. Investment and reciprocity by unaffiliated (rarely grooming) non-kin females tended to occur most promptly. This is in accord with the hypothesis that fairness of reciprocity can be easier assessed if reciprocal acts occur immediately. Effects were less in affiliated non-kin pairs (frequently grooming), and least between kin.</page><page sequence="319">VOLUME 128 961 Behaviour Vol. 128 (1994) pp. 121-134 PREDATOR INSPECTION BEHAVIOUR COVARIES WITH SCHOOLING TENDENCY AMONGST WILD GUPPY, POECILIA RETICULATA, POPULATIONS IN TRINIDAD ANNE E. MAGURRAN and BENONI H. SEGHERS Animal Behaviour Research Group, Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford OXI 3PS, UK When fish inspect a predator they incur risk. One way of reducing the cost of inspection is to approach predators in groups large enough to benefit from the safety in numbers advantages of schooling. In a survey of nine populations of guppies, Poecilia reticulata, in their native streams in Trinidad, we observed marked variation is schooling behaviour. Guppies from sites also inhabited by a major predator, the pike cichlid, Crenicichla alta, devoted more time to schooling than those from less dangerous locations where the cyprinodont Rivulus hartii was present. We found a strong correlation between schooling tendency and the group sizes adopted by guppies inspecting a realistic model predator. Since guppies in dangerous localities approached a potential predator in large groups it seems unlikely that many of these fish were caught in a Prisoner's Dilemma. Inspections by singleton fish were rare in high-risk locations but predominated in those populations where risk from fish predators was reduced.

The laboratory experiments in this paper demonstrate that, contrary to expectations, seahorses exhibit conventional sex roles: male seahorses compete more intensely than females for access to mates, on both the first and final days of courtship. Competing males are more active than competing females in those courtship and competitive behaviours common to both sexes, and only males exhibit uniquely competitive behaviours (wrestling and snapping). Males which succeeded in copulating are heavier than their rivals and copulating seahorses of both sexes generally are more active in courtship and competition than are their unsuccessful rivals. The finding that seahorses maintain conventional sex roles requires us to reconsider the impact of male pregnancy on the OSR. Behaviour Vol. 128 (1994) pp. 153-168 OPERATIONAL SEX RATIOS IN SEAHORSES AMANDA C.J. VINCENT Large Animal Research Group, Department of Zoology, University of Cambridge, Downing St., Cambridge CB2 3EJ, UK Contrary to all expectations based on their male pregnancy, recent work shows that seahorses exhibit conventional sex roles in mating competition: male seahorses compete more to obtain eggs than females do to give their eggs away. This suggests that the operational sex ratio (OSR: the relative number of males and females available to mate) might be male-biased despite the length and limitations of male pregnancy. I here report a study of a laboratory population if the Sri Lankan seahorse Hippocampus fuscus. The OSR amongst mated seahorses is unbiased because males and females effectively have equal reproductive rates, although some evidence suggests that a female may have limited potential for a higher reproductive rate than her partner. In contrast, the OSR among mate-seeking seahorses is male-biased, because unmated (empty) males can prepare to mate more quickly and can remain ready to mate for longer than can unmated females. Thus, the OSR is male-biased in exactly that segment of the population which should compete for mates. These findings are compatible with the sexually monogamous mating pattern of many seahorse species.</page><page sequence="320">962 VOLUME 128 Behaviour Vol. 128 (1994) pp. 169-188 INCEST AVOIDANCE AND ATTAINMENT OF DOMINANCE BY FEMALES IN A CAPE MOUNTAIN ZEBRA (EQUUS ZEBRA ZEBRA) POPULATION O.A.E. RASA and P.H. LLOYD Abt. Ethologie, Zoologisches Institut, Bonn University, Kirschallee 1, 53115 Bonn, Germany &amp; Chief Directorate of Nature and Anvironmental Conservation, Stellenbosch, R. South Africa The mating strategies employed by Cape Mountain zebra and the routes by which dominance are attained by females are described. Both sexes tend to join non-breeding groups, males joining groups containing familiar males, females joining groups with male strangers. The nuclei of new herds are formed by long- term attachments between colts and fillies within these groups, the first filly forming such an attachment becoming the subsequent dominant mare. Fillies not joining non-breeding groups become subordinates in established breeding herds. For established mares only herd change on loss of the stallion may lead to status improvement. The reproductive success of the three main strategies employed by mares (attachment, herd change and direct annexation) did not differ and showed little deviation from expected reproductive success based on population fecundity. Only the first two strategies led to dominant status which is correlated with high fitness based on foal survival. Dominance for fillies was dependent on the presence of unattached colts with which they could form new breeding herds and was age-related within a female cohort, the oldest female forming at attachment first. Two forms of familiarity resulting in a repulsion towards male relatives followed in ontogeny by an attraction to male strangers are postulated as regulating the social associations of fillies. Evidence is put forward that mate choice operates amongst females. Behaviour Vol. 128 (1994) pp. 189-228 UNGULATE ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOUR: PRELIMINARY AND COMPARATIVE DATA FROM AFRICAN BOVIDS T.M. CARO Department of Wildlife and Fisheries Biology, University of California, Davis, CA 95616, USA and Serengeti Wildlife Research Institute, P.O. Box 661, Arusha, Tanzania The adaptive significance of antipredator behaviour patterns was examined in six species of African bovid by recording the behaviours' design features during flights from a human on foot. Snorting signalled awareness of the predator, and did not warn conspecifics of danger. Leaping in impalas reduced flight speeds and was an honest signal of the performer's physical condition. Bounding was used by many species to clear obstacles. Stotting carried a time cost and it too signalled the prey's physical condition. Tacking and prancing were behaviours shown primarily by Alcelaphines and, respectively, may have served to wrong-foot a predator, and signal that the prey had achieved a safe distance from it. These findings indicate that pursuit deterrent signals are common in bovids; that some convey specific information about the situation at hand while others pass on additional information about the prey's condition; and that signals of condition are kept honest by being coupled to demonstrated time and probable energetic costs as theory predicts. Across a wider sample of 13 species, pursuit deterrence appears to be associated with plains living species. Where there are few opportunities for hiding, and prey can only evade capture by outdistancing or outmanoeuvring the predator, there may be greater selection on the use of signals to convince the predator to halt its advance.

GOLDBERG 325 Squire Hall, State Hall, State University of New York, Buffalo, NY 14214, USA Ethology defines action patterns as relatively invariant, species-specific movement patterns. Action patterns are said to have species-specific form features, much like anatomical morphology contains species-specific form features. However, morphology exists in space, whereas movements take form in time. Thus, movements and morphology cannot be quantified in the same way. Standard methods of quantifying</page><page sequence="321">VOLUME 128 963 the spatial and temporal dimensions of animal movements are not amenable to statistical, cross-species comparative studies. This paper describes a method of quantifying masticatory jaw movements so that rigorous cross-species comparisons can be made. Results show that jaw movements contain species-specific features, many of which are not visually detectable. The results suggest that it is possible to interpret the action pattern definition literally in that masticatory jaw movements have a quantifiable form, which contains species- specific features. Furthermore, the results show that jaw movement forms appear to reflect an animal's phylogenetic history as well as its current feeding niche. Future investigations should be able to eluci- date how phylogeny and dietary selection pressures interact to produce specific features of dentoskeletal morphology and masticatory movement form.

Wickler, Max-Planck Institut fur Verhaltensphysiologie, D-82319 Seewiesen/Post Starnberg, Germany, e-mail: Wikelski@mpi-seewiesen.mpg.de FRITZ TRILLMICH Behavioral Ecology, University of Bielefeld, PO Box 100131, 33501 Bielefeld, Germany, e-mail: Fritz. Trillmich@biologie.uni-bielefeld.de Ontogenetic development in reptiles entails major changes in size-related foraging options. We studied the changes in foraging behavior of marine iguanas. In this species, size increases about twenty- to hundredfold from hatching to full adult size. The foraging strategy of marine iguanas was studied at Miedo on Santa F6 Island in the Galapagos archipelago. During low tide, large marine iguanas (&gt; 250 mm snout vent length (SVL)) foraged more in the lower intertidal than small ones (&lt; 250 mm SVL) which preferred the upper intertidal with higher temperatures and less frequent wave washing. Animals usually returned to the same foraging site day after day and had lower food intake after changing their foraging site. Feeding accounted for 60% of the time spent in the intertidal. Smaller animals fed every day, larger ones only every other day. Smaller individuals shuttled faster between foraging and basking sites than larger ones. Total feeding time per day was, however, the same for both size classes. At neap tides (_ high water level at low tide) animals had shorter foraging bouts than at spring tides with much lower water levels at peak low tide. Length of feeding bouts depended most on wave action, time of low tide (during the daylight period), and body mass of an animal. Small animals fed significantly less at higher than at lower wave activities. All animals on Santa Fe spent more time feeding in the intertidal than in the subtidal. Only large males additionally foraged subtidally and the more so the bigger they were. During the reproductive season, territorial males were less likely to go foraging, but when feeding, territorials fed more subtidally than non-territorials, went foraging earlier, and spent less time foraging in the IT than non-territorials. Ability to resist wave drag increased with body size but did not decrease at lower body temperature, whereas running speed did so significantly. Bite frequency during foraging also decreased with decreasing body temperature and smaller, younger animals had higher bite rates than older, bigger ones. White-painted animals rewarmed slower than naturally black ones and partially compensated for this by shortening foraging bouts but increasing their number. The observed age-related changes in foraging behavior can be explained by postulating a rule of the form 'forage while warm and warm up when getting inefficient at grazing'. Of course, animals will also stop feeding should the stomach be filled before the end of the low tide cycle. To explain age- and motivation-related differences in foraging behavior, the only change that needs to be postulated is in the thresholds of body temperature inducing switches from foraging to warming-up and back. These changes are adaptive responses to size-related changes in costs and benefits of foraging in a cool, wave-washed environment.</page><page sequence="322">964 VOLUME 128 Behaviour Vol. 128 (1994) pp. 281-300 THE EFFECTS OF SOCIAL LEARNING ON THE FOOD CHOICE OF THE HOUSE SPARROW (PASSER DOMESTICUS) STEVEN L. FRYDAY and PETER W. GREIG-SMITH Central Science Laboratory, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Tangley Place, Worplesdon, Guildford, Surrey, GU3 3LQ UK The effects of social feeding on the selection of novel coloured food and food intake by house sparrows (Passer domesticus) were studied in three experiments. In the first experiment, birds were given the choice of feeding on two novel types of coloured food after observations of an experienced bird feeding on them. These observers consumed more food of the colour that they had observed being eaten and also had an elevated total consumption compared to birds that had observed coloured food alone. In the second experiment, birds were given a choice between red and yellow food while adjacent to an experienced bird that was feeding on either red food or quinine-treated red food. The group observing consumption of treated red food consumed less red food than the other group. There was a significant correlation between consumption by the experienced bird and the consumption of red food by the observed which suggested that this effect was not due to a learned aversion. The third experiment was carried out to investigate the effect of previous experience on the behaviour of observers feeding in the presence of demonstrators eating red food or quinine-treated red food. The observers had either 'good' (untreated red food) or 'bad' (quinine-treated red food) experience before observation trials. It was found that only the previous good or bad experience of the observers affected consumption and there was no difference based on the feeding experiences of the demonstrators. These results are discussed in relation to the opportunities for, and types of, social learning of food preferences that may occur in house sparrow flocks. Behaviour Vol. 128 (1994) pp. 301-3 10 TESTOSTERONE AFFECTS THE ACOUSTIC STRUCTURE OF THE MALE CALL IN THE GREY PARTRIDGE (PERDIX PERDIX) L. FUSANI, L. BEANI and F. DESSI-FULGHERI Dipartimento di Biologia Animale e Genetica, Universita di Firenze, via Romana 17, 50125 Firenze, Italy The effects of testosterone (T) on the acoustic features of the "rusty-gate" call of the grey partridge, a non-oscine bird, were studied in 24 males kept in semi-natural conditions. Half of them were implanted subcutaneously with T propionate in Silastic tubes at 10 weeks of age, the remaining were sham operated as controls. After one month implanted males showed significantly higher T levels than controls, while treatment did not affect body size. Individual recordings of calls were analysed and accurate measurements were taken by a digital spectrograph. The duration of call was significantly greater in T-males than in controls. A similar lengthening has been described in nature in spring, when plasma levels of androgens rise. The frequencies of the most intense portion of the call ranged more widely and had a lower minimum in T-males than in controls, suggesting an hormonal control on call system at the peripheral/central level. In conclusion T affects specific temporal and frequency features of the male calls. The relationship between T and call structure could enable females to assess quality and sexual motivation of their potential mates.

Analysis of accompanying changes in feeding time showed that the inhibition caused by the cock's presence is aggression-specific (though its nature is still unknown), while the alpha hen, as an aggressive competitor, restricts the sub- ordinates' access to food so that they lack the resource they would defend. The evidence suggests that, with the cock as well as the dominant hen, the low rate of aggression in subordinates is not due to a lack of time for attacks but rather to a lack of aggressive motivation.</page><page sequence="323">VOLUME 129 Behaviour Vol. 129 (1994) pp. 1-12 VIGILANCE IN NXAI PAN SPRINGBOK, ANTIDORCAS MARSUPIALIS PETER A. BEDNEKOFFRON RITTER Department of Biological Sciences, Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, AZ 86011-5640, U.S.A. RON RITTER Department of Zoology, Oxford University, Oxford OX1 3PS, U.K. Vigilance rates were surveyed on juvenile and adult female springbok in 3 positions (close edge, center, and far edge) in herds of 17 to 536 springbok in Nxai Pan N.P., Botswana. Rates were generally low. They decreased as group size increased but were not lower when other grazers joined springbok herds. Edge animals spent roughly twice as much time vigilant as central animals. Juveniles were slightly less vigilant than adults but this may reflect greater movement. Surprisingly, springbok were more vigilant in late mornings than in early mornings or afternoons. Springbok approaching tree clumps were more vigilant than matched individuals moving in the open. Preliminary data indicate that vigilance is higher at night than during the day and that territorial males have moderate to low levels of vigilance. In general, vigilance varied in ways expected to lower the risk of being taken by ambush predators such as leopards. Behaviour Vol. 129 (1994) pp. 13-34 COLD-INDUCED CALLING AND SHIVERING IN YOUNG AMERICAN WH1TE PELICANS: HONEST SIGNALLING OF OFFSPRING NEED FOR WARMTH IN A FUNCTIONALLY INTEGRATED THERMOREGULATORY SYSTEM ROGER M. EVANS Department of Zoology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada R3T 2N2 Vocal regulation of body temperature in thermally dependent offspring can occur when cold-induced vocalizations elicit appropriate brooding and rewarming by a parent or surrogate. I tested the ability of young American white pelicans to regulate vocally body temperature in the laboratory by exposing them to moderate chilling (20-23°C), either continuously, or punctuated by brief (usually 2 min) periods of warmth in response to cold-induced calling. When continuously chilled, they began to call almost immediately (median latency 35 s), and body temperature began to drop. At 1 and 2 weeks of age, visible shivering also occurred, but was not sufficient to arrest the decline in body temperature. When chilling was then ameliorated by brief periods of warmth in response to cold-induced calling, body temperature shifted upwards, indicating a vocal thermoregulatory ability similar to, but somewhat faster, than that previously reported for late-stage embryos in this species. At 1 day of age, cold-induced calling occurred with a shorter latency and at a higher rate at lower body temperatures, as expected in a compensatory thermoregulatory system. After the onset of shivering thermogenesis at 1 and 2 weeks of age, the compensatory response decreased, but calling still occurred in response to chilling, as required by a simple on-off regulatory system. Begging for food was inhibited at body temperatures low enough to elicit shivering, suggesting that vocal maintenance of a relatively high body temperature may be of importance to normal begging and food acquisition prior to the full development of endothermy in this species. Effective functioning of the vocal thermoregulatory system requires that information about offspring body temperature be accurate. This requirement suggests a strong parallel between vocal thermoregulation and the concept of honest signalling in animal communication. Honest signalling of need by offspring has received recent theoretical support, but is controversial and has rarely been tested experimentally. I used the occurrence of shivering, which is the main source of endothermic heat in birds, as a standard against which to test empirically the honesty of cold-induced calls as signals of need for warmth. When 1 and 2-week old chilled, shivering chicks began to warm up during vocal regulation sessions, shivering eventually became periodic, starting each time a bird was chilled and ending during each subsequent period of rewarming. Calling at this time invariably (84 of 84 cases) began only after the onset of shivering, then ended while shivering was still in progress. To the extent that shivering is an honest, perhaps unfakable indicator of a biologically relevant need for warmth, the vocalizations associated with it appear to be honest signals indicating the presence of that need. Results are also consistent with a recent theoretical model of honest signalling of need by offspring, but it remains to be determined whether honest solicitation of warmth prevails when chicks are in naturally competitive situations at the nest. 965</page><page sequence="324">966 VOLUME 129 Behaviour Vol. 129 (1994) pp. 35-62 THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMMUNICATION IN PRETERM INFANT-MOTHER DYADS Y. VAN BEEK and B. HOPKINS Faculty of Human Movement Sciences, Department of Educational Sciences Faculty, Free University, Van der Boechorststraat 9, 1081 BT Amsterdam J.B. HOEKSMA Faculty of Psychological and Pedagogical Sciences, Department of Developmental Psychology, Free University, Van der Boechorststraat 9, 1081 BT Amsterdam The present study examines the effects of gestational age and birthweight status on the development of infant and maternal behaviour as well as the (mutual) predictability between partners during face-to-face interaction at 6, 12 and 18 weeks of corrected age. Subjects are healthy fullterm infants (N = 6) and three groups of healthy preterm infants: small-for-gestational age (N = 6), and appropriate for gestational age, the latter being born after a pregnancy duration of less than 32 weeks (N = 6) or between 32 and 34 weeks (N = 6). Using dyadic sequential analyses, based on log-linear modelling and information statistics, for each individual infant-mother pair at each age, the effect of both partners on the behaviour of the other was quantified, while accounting for autocorrelational effects. In the majority of cases the interactions could be labelled as showing 'bidirectionality', particularly at 18 weeks. Mothers were more likely to be influenced by the previous behaviour of the infants than vice versa. No group differences were apparent in the way mothers were influenced by their infants. However, the small-for-gestational age preterm infants were less likely to be influenced by maternal behaviour, particularly at 6 and 12 weeks of age. A lower variability was the most common finding in infants who were not predictable from the previous behaviour of the mother. At 6 and 12 weeks they were less expressive and more often showed a monotonous behavioural pattern in which 'looking at mother's face without positive expressions' was shown during most of the interaction. As this lack of variability was more often found in SGA preterm infants, they were less predictable from their mother's behaviour than the fullterm and AGA preterm infants. These data suggest that having a low birthweight for gestational age may be a risk factor for a lack of 'bidirectionality' during early mother-infant interaction. Behaviour Vol. 129 (1994) pp. 63-78 EFFECTS OF PARENT AND OFFSPRING FOOD RATIONS ON PARENTAL CARE IN THE CONVICT CICHLID FISH (PISCES, CICHLIDAE) ROBERT J. LAVERY and JAMES D. KIEFFER Department of Biology, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada K7L 3N6 Animals may provide more care for their young under certain environmental conditions. For instance, if food is plentiful parents may invest more in the current brood than if food is scarce, assuming that food abundance is correlated with parent and offspring condition. In this experiment, we manipulated food levels (low vs high) for both parents and offspring to determine if parental care is influenced by parental and/or offspring condition in the convict cichlid, Cichlasoma nigrofasciatum. Parents which were fed a higher ration gained weight, whereas parents fed a lower ration lost weight. Similarly, young which were fed a higher ration were significantly larger than young fed a lower ration. Parents which were fed a higher ration defended their brood more vigorously than parents fed a lower ration. Offspring condition had little effect on parental care. Furthermore, females consistently invested more than males. The results show that parental convict cichlids adjust care in response to their own food supply rather than that of their offspring. Behaviour Vol. 129 (1994) pp. 79-98 TIMING AND USE OF PATERNITY GUARDS BY MALE CHAFFINCHES B.C. SHELDON Department of Animal and Plant Sciences, The University of Sheffield, PO Box 601, Sheffield, S10 2UQ, UK I studied the relative timing and extent to which male chaffinches used two alternative paternity guards, frequent copulation and mate guarding by close following. Males guarded their mates strongly, and</page><page sequence="325">VOLUME 129 967 guarding peaked in intensity on day -2 relative to laying. Male mate guarding intensity varied predictably with the value of the female to the male in three ways: (a) guarding intensity increased from day to day as laying approached, as does the risk of a single EPC fertilizing an egg. (b) Males reduced their level of guarding when their females laid the penultimate egg of the clutch and were therefore no longer fertile. (c) The diurnal pattern of guarding varied with respect to whether laying had begun, which might represent a male response to an 'insemination window', when sperm would be less likely to fertilize an egg. Males also copulated frequently with their mates, with a peak rate of 4.4 copulation attempts per hour on day -3 relative to laying, with an estimated total of 207 copulation attempts (83 successful) per clutch. The peak in copulation frequency occurred earlier than the peak in mate guarding intensity. Males did not show any behavioural response to an increased risk of extra-pair copulations, assessed by the proportion of neighbouring males that were free to seek extra-pair copulations. I propose that in chaffinches frequent copulation is a relatively 'low-cost, high-risk' paternity assurance mechanism compared to mate guarding, and that the mechanism males employ depends upon the amount of information that males have about whether the female is going to lay, which represents the value of the female to the male. Fine-tuning of male behavioural mechanisms with the female value as a resource provides good evidence that the mechanisms are adaptations to sperm competition. Behaviour Vol. 129 (1994) pp. 99-112 MALE DOMINANCE AND REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS IN A CAPTIVE GROUP OF RHESUS MACAQUES (MACACA MULATTA) DAVID GLENN SMITH Department of Anthropology and California Regional Primate Research Center, University of California, Davis, CA 95616, U.S.A. Paternity exclusion analysis was employed to estimate the reproductive success (RS) of 32 males who experienced at least one breeding season over the age of four years between 1977 and 1991 in a captive group of rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). Although three different males held alpha rank during the period, the male dominance hierarchy remained relatively stable even when the number of males was high. Average dominance rank and overall RS of males while in the group were strongly correlated. However, during most years the correlation between male dominance rank and RS was not statistically significant because males who achieved high rank 1) were those who experienced relatively high RS as lower ranking subadults and 2) maintained high dominance rank after experiencing a sustained decline in RS. Correlations between male dominance rank and RS were highest when the number of subadult males entering the dominance hierarchy was increasing and one or a very few males were least effective in monopolizing females. These results are not consistent with expectations based solely on the priority of access model of intrasexual selection. Female choice, as exemplified by the preference of females for mating with young males that are rising in rank, might also influence the evolution of social dominance in rhesus macaques. Behaviour Vol. 129 (1994) pp. 113-140 MALE FEEDING OF NESTLINGS IN THE FACULTATIVELY POLYGYNOUS EUROPEAN STARLING: ALLOCATION PATTERNS AND EFFECT ON FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS RIANNE PINXTEN and MARCEL EENS University of Antwerp, U.I.A. Universiteitsplein 1, B-2610 Wilrijk, Belgium Parental investment by males is less common among birds with polygynous mating systems than in monogamous species. Here, we examined the contribution of males in feeding nestlings in the facultatively polygynous European starling, Sturnus vulgaris. 1. In nestbox colonies around Antwerp, Belgium, males and females within monogamous pairs divided the feeding duties about equally, with a slight bias towards the female, and responded similarly to changes in brood size and age of nestlings. 2. The proportion of primary females receiving male assistance in feeding nestlings was significantly smaller than the proportion of monogamous females during each of the three nestling age stages (early, mid and late) we considered. In most primary broods, the strong decrease in male assistance was not due to the male directing part of his feeding effort toward the brood of the secondary female, but was due to the fact that the male's investment in feeding primary nestlings was negatively affected by his polygynous behaviour. As prospecting females were present after hatching of the primary broods (as contrasted to</page><page sequence="326">968 VOLUME 129 other studied starling populations), most males spent time trying to attract and courting additional females instead of giving parental care to the primary brood. This suggests that males trade off the attraction of additional females against giving parental care to an existing brood. The proportion of secondary females receiving male assistance in feeding was significantly smaller than the proportion of monogamous females during the early- and mid nestling stages. Overall, secondary females received less male assistance than primary females. The amount of male help to primary and secondary broods was not related to the hatching interval between the primary and secondary brood. 3. Primary females did not suffer reduced breeding success compared to monogamous females. In sec- ondary broods, nestling mortality (partial brood loss) was significantly higher than in both primary and monogamous broods, while average nestling weights were significantly lower. These results suggest that secondary females, as contrasted to primary females, are not able to compensate fully for the reduction in male assistance. 4. During the mid-nestling stage, when nestlings grow most rapidly, but not during the early- and late- nestling stages, polygynously mated females feeding young without male assistance significantly increased their per-caput feeding rate compared with aided polygynous females and monogamous females, and made as many feeding visits as did polygynous pairs in which the male assisted, and as monogamous pairs. The higher nestling mortality rates in polygynous broods without male help during the early and mid-nestling stages suggest that unaided females cannot compensate fully (in terms of quantity or quality of food delivered), that male starlings can improve female fledging success by assisting in feeding nestlings, and that the reduced reproductive success of secondary females is directly linked to the strongly reduced male assistance in feeding. Behaviour Vol. 129 (1994) pp. 141-148 EFFECTS OF TESTOSTERONE ON NEST-BOX OCCUPATION AND ASSOCIATED BEHAVIOURS BY MALE EUROPEAN STARLINGS (STURNUS VULGARIS) HELGA GWINNER and EBERHARD GWINNER Max-Planck-Institut fur Verhaltensphysiologie, D 82346 Andechs, Germany In an aviary experiment carried out at the beginning of the breeding season in March and April, nest- box occupation and associated behaviours were observed in a group of 18 adult and 18 first-year male European starlings. Nine birds of each group carried a testosterone implant (T-males) and the other 9 an empty implant (C-males). When analyzed for effects of age, first year birds were significantly more active with regard to nest-box inspection and nest building than adults. When analyzed for effects of treatment, T-males occupied more nest-boxes and visited their nest-boxes more often than C-males. Other activities like singing, nest-box inspection, nest-building and aggressive behaviour were not significantly different between T-males and C-males. We suggest that the absence of a significant effect of T on aggression may be related to the colonial nesting habits of the starling. Since T-males tended to be more active with regard to all behaviours studied testosterone may have led to a general increase in frequency and persistence of behaviour which in turn facilitated nest-box occupation. Behaviour Vol. 129 (1994) pp. 149-176 PATTERNS OF PATERNITY IN RELATION TO MALE SOCIAL RANK IN THE STUMPTAILED MACAQUE, MA CA CA ARCTOIDES K.A. BAUERS and J.P. HEARN Wisconsin Regional Primate Research Center, 1220 Capital Court, Madison, Wisconsin, 53715-1299 U.S.A. The macaques have been a central focus of research designed to illuminate the interrelationship of be- haviour and patterns of genetic transmission in non-human primates. Due to unique aspects of the socio- sexual behaviour and reproductive biology of stumptailed macaques (Macaca arctoides), we hypothesized a stronger relationship between male status and reproductive success than has been documented in other macaque species. The relationship between male social rank and success in siring offspring was exam- ined for a sequence of 27 infants born over an 8-year period (1984-1992) in a large captive social group. Paternity of 25 of the 27 infants (all those still living at the time of testing) was confirmed with the use of "DNA profile tests" using mini-satellite, multi-locus probes in collaboration with Drs. CASNA and GERGITS of Therion Corp. Results showed that each of three consecutive alpha males was effective in achieving a virtual monopoly in siring offspring during his tenure, with one exception possibly related to inbreeding</page><page sequence="327">VOLUME 129 969 avoidance. Although patterns of sexual behaviour are not emphasized in this report, behavioural observa- tions over the past six years support the findings of other researchers regarding the alpha male's extreme intolerance of mating by subordinate males. Covert mating by subordinate males occurred, though this was not reflected in paternity of young born. The data suggest that environmental restrictions (e.g. of space and privacy) in captivity are influential in restricting the reproductive opportunities of subordinate males, in accord with previous suggestions of ESTEP et al. (1988). Research with two wild groups has been initiated to gather comparative data on these issues. We predict that greater diversity in paternity will characterize age cohorts in wild groups of stumptailed macaques, due to the greater social dependen- cies existing between males (e.g. for group defense), and because the alpha male may not be as able to effectively monitor or monopolize females in more natural environments. However, we predict that both in nature and in captivity, diversity in paternity in stumptail groups will be less than that in comparable groups of other macaque species, for reasons related to the unique role of the alpha male stumptail in a social organization which reflects highly developed defensive capacities, and to the comparatively greater reproductive investment that infants represent in this slow-breeding species.

High- ranking males can form long-term consorts and guard female mates while low-ranking males frequently resort to quick copulations under the cover of vegetation. No single reproductive tactic provided the Group S males with a definitive reproductive advantage during the one-year study. Males using the long- term tactic and the quick, stealth tactic sired five offspring each, but fewer males used the long-term consort tactic. Males using the long-term reproductive tactic have significantly greater mating success than males using the quick, sneaky tactic, and may have greater reproductive success. The highest-ranking males who form long-term consorts had the greatest degree of reproductive success. This indicates that for the highest-ranking males, forming long-term consorts is the most effective reproductive tactic. The effectiveness of alternative tactics for high-ranking males (i.e. consort disruption and possessive following) was equivocal. Consort disruption had no immediate effect on reproductive success. Possessive following may have resulted in the siring of two offspring by the alpha male, but was ineffective in other cases, where the females were inseminated by subordinate males. The effectiveness of the quick, furtive tactic was demonstrated by the siring of 45% of the infants by males who used this tactic.Thus males who are not high-ranking and cannot form long-term consorts can reproduce. This study demonstrated that alternative reproductive tactics are used and reap reproductive benefits for males in the seasonally-breeding rhesus macaques on Cayo Santiago.</page><page sequence="328">970 VOLUME 129 Behaviour Vol. 129 (1994) pp. 203-224 SOCIAL AND GENETIC ASPECTS OF PATERNITY IN WILD LONG-TAILED MACAQUES (MACACA FASCICULARIS) JAN R. DE RUITER and JAN A.R.A.M. VAN HOOFF Ethology &amp; Socio-ecology Group, Utrecht University, The Netherlands WOLFGANG SCHEFFRAHN Anthropologisches Institute der Universitat Zurich, Switzerland In a field study of three groups of wild long-tailed macaques, Macaca fascicularis, observations on social behaviour could be related to genetically determined paternity. In contrast to what has been found in many previous studies on captive primate groups, we found a relatively strong correlation between male dominance rank and reproductive success. In a large group the high success of the alpha male compared to other males could be explained only partly by his higher copulation score. His success also resulted partly from better timing of his copulations during maximum fertility of the females, in comparison with other males. We must conclude either that the alpha-male has more access to fertile females, or that females have a preference for the alpha-male during their maximum fertility. The females clearly displayed promiscuous behaviour. This behaviour implies a risk to a female that a male other than the alpha-male with proven qualities will become the father of her offspring. One expects that there must be a social advantage related to this female strategy. In the absence of indications of any direct social advantages to the female of this sexual behaviour pattern, the ultimate explanation for this female promiscuity is most likely is aggression reduction. This could be either through the devaluating of any single copulation, or through the confusion of paternity and a resultant reduction in the risk of infanticide. Behaviour Vol. 129 (1994) pp. 225-242 AGE, SEX AND PRIOR SITE EXPERIENCE HAVE INDEPENDENT EFFECTS ON THE FORAGING SUCCESS OF WINTERING SNOW BUNTINGS RICHARD D. SMITH and NEIL B. METCALFE Applied Ornithology Unit, Department of Zoology, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, G12 8QQ, Scotland, UK Intraspecific variation in foraging success amongst birds is often associated with differences between individuals in competitive ability or experience. However, it is usually difficult to separate the importance of experience per se from that of age. Here we examined the feeding rates of wintering snow buntings (Plectrophenax nivalis) at Cairn Gorm, North-east Scotland in both competitive and non-competitive situations. Although flock-size/density and stage of the feeding bout accounted for most of the explainable variation in peck-rates, there remained significant and additive residual effects of both age and prior experience of the site (older/more experienced birds achieving higher feeding rates) and these effects were very similar for birds feeding alone or in flocks. Sex differences in feeding rates were only apparent in large flocks, where males (the dominant sex) had faster peck-rates than females. Birds without previous experience (whether age or site-related) showed increases in relative feeding rate during the course of the winter, whereas experienced birds did not. This suggest that the differences between experienced and inexperienced birds were due to learning rather than the disproportionate loss of poor foragers. Behaviour Vol. 129 (1994) pp. 243-278 USE OF TWO SINGING MODES BY HOODED WARBLERS AS ADAPTATIONS FOR SIGNALLING R. HAVEN WILEY, RENEE GODARD and ANDREW D. THOMPSON, JR. Department of Biology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-3280, U.S.A. Hooded warblers Wilsonia citrina use two modes of singing, repeat mode (one pattern sung repeatedly) and mixed mode (2-4 other patterns sung in irregular sequence). Intensive focal-individual sampling of 14 males documented the use of these modes of singing throughout the nesting cycle. Males of different ages (first breeding season or later) did not differ in use of the two modes. Time spent singing in repeat mode decreased markedly after acquiring a mate, but time spent singing mixed mode did not change significantly across stages of the nesting cycle. Males sang more when their neighbors sang at a distance of 25 m</page><page sequence="329">VOLUME 129 971 or more. Repeat mode increased in this situation before a male acquired a mate, while mixed mode increased afterwards. Near a neighbor (within 25 m), males avoided use of repeat mode. Nearby females before the onset of incubation evoked increased use of repeat mode. More distant, calling females elicited little response before incubation, but thereafter calling females tended to suppress all singing. Males used mixed mode proportionately more in locations nearer neighbors. There were no indications that variation in singing influenced the dates on which males acquired mates. Unmated males late in the breeding season sang persistently in repeat mode, even more than eventually mated males had early in the season before they acquired mates. These results provide support, with some reservations, for three hypotheses for the evolution of distinct modes of singing: (1) specializations for male and female listeners; (2) specializations for indicating conditional behavioral tendencies; and (3) specializations for communication in low- and high-noise situations. These hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, and all three in combination might offer the strongest explanation for the evolution of distinct singing modes in this species and other paruline warblers. Behaviour Vol. 129 (1994) pp. 279-292 FLOCK SIZE AND FORAGING DECISIONS IN CENTRAL PLACE FORAGING WHITE STORKS, CICONIA CICONIA JAVIER A. ALONSO Departamento de Biologia Animal, Facultad de Biologia, Universidad Complutense, 28040 Madrid, Spain JUAN C. ALONSO, LUIS M. CARRASCAL and RODRIGO MUNOZ-PULIDO Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales, CSIC, Jose Gutierrez Abascal 2, 28006 Madrid, Spain We studied the foraging decisions of six individually marked white storks at a breeding colony in central Spain. Storks behaved as central place foragers, gathering in flocks to feed. Travel distance and patch residence time were positively correlated with the size of the foraging flock, but not with patch quality as estimated by the instantaneous food intake rate at the patch. Patch residence time was also positively correlated with travel distance to the patch, flock size being constant. In larger flocks individuals benefitted from a decrease in vigilance time and thus an increase in time spent actively feeding, which enabled birds to bring back to the nest a higher load size. These results suggest that storks followed simple rules of thumb based on flock size, rather than on the more complicated food availability estimations required by central place foraging models. We suggest that flock size could be the main cue used in foraging decisions by white storks and could be a simple rule for many other flock foraging species. Behaviour Vol. 129 (1994) pp. 293-305 SEXUAL RESPONSIVENESS OF FEMALE CANARIES TO SONG BOUT ORGANIZATION MICHEL KREUTZER, ERIC VALLET and LAURENT NAGLE Laboratoire d'6thologie experimentale et comparee, URA CNRS 667, Universite Paris Nord, 93430, Villetaneuse, France Recent experiments demonstrated that in oscine species, 1) Some special sequences of multipartite songs convey more sexual information than others and 2) Stimulus change or switching is often associated with intersexual interactions. We looked for an influence of these two song cues in common domesticated canaries. Female canaries were tested for their sexual copulation solicitation display (CSD) in response to the playbacks of different. strings of song sequences from males of the same breed. In order to induce habituation, three monotonous strings were created: A.A.A.A.A.A; B.B.B.B.B.B. and C.C.C.C.C.C. (repetition of the same song sequence). In order to manage disrupt of habituation by stimulus changes, four types of strings including two types of song sequences were created: B.B.B.A.A.A., A.A.A.B.B.B., C.C.C.B.B.B. and B.B.B.C.C.C. We found that a monotonous repetition of the same sequence leads to habituation when the sexual potency of the sequence is high (sequences A and B) and that song sequences may greatly differ in eliciting sexual displays (A &gt; B &gt; C). Subsequent stimulus change may elicit an immediate response recovery. But such a disrupt of habituation occurs only if a prefered sequence follows a non prefered one. We discuss prominent parameters that may have influenced female sensitivity and responsiveness to string organization in domesticated canaries.</page><page sequence="330">VOLUME 130 Behaviour Vol. 130 (1994) pp. 1-16 THE ROLE OF PITCH CUES IN SONG RECOGNITION BY CAROLINA CHICKADEES (PARUS CAROLINENSIS) BERNARD LOHR, RONALD WEISMAN and STEPHEN NOWICKI Department of Zoology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27708 Carolina chickadees sing songs characterized by obvious frequency changes between adjacent notes. Several songbird species have been suggested to use the pitch interval cues available from frequency ratios in their song for song recognition. We evaluated whether Carolina chickadees use pitch interval cues in song recognition using playback of song in the field to territorial males as a response assay. In contrast to previous studies, we found a similar response to songs with altered frequency ratios as to those with normal ratios, suggesting that pitch interval cues are not important for song recognition in Carolina chickadees. We also demonstrate that Carolina chickadees do not distinguish between recordings of naturally produced songs and songs synthesized using measured parameters of natural songs, validating our approach to experimental manipulation of song parameters. Our results indicate that different songbird species may be using different mechanisms for recognizing conspecifics. Behaviour Vol. 130 (1994) pp. 17-28 FACTORS AFFECTING TIMING OF BROOD DESERTION BY FEMALE KENTISH PLOVERS CHARADRIUS ALEXANRINUS TAMAS SZEKELY and TONY D. WILLIAMS Department of Animal and Plant Sciences, Sheffield University, P.O. Box 601, Sheffield, S10 2UQ, U.K. We investigated the factors affecting timing of female desertion in the Kentish plover Charadrius alexan- drinus, in relation to a number of previously proposed hypotheses. Females deserted their broods on average 5.9 ± 1.4 (SE) days after hatching. Although timing of desertion was highly variable (0-30 d), females deserted on the day of hatching in 9 out of 33 broods (median = 2.3 d). Timing of desertion was not related to mass or condition of the female at hatching, suggesting that energetic costs of incu- bation were not involved in determining desertion time. Similarly, there was no significant relationship between timing of desertion and the quality of the female's mate, either in terms of his mass, condition, or relative contribution to parental care prior to desertion. Desertion time was also unrelated to brood quality measured by weight, size or number of chicks at hatching. However, timing of desertion was neg- atively related to hatching date. We conclude that the strategy of desertion is time-constrained: females with early-hatching broods can afford to spend more time with their first brood (perhaps enhancing their expected gain from this brood) and still have sufficient time to desert, remate and rear a second brood. Females with later-hatching broods must desert this brood earlier in order to have time to rear a second brood successfully. Behaviour Vol. 130 (1994) pp. 29-40 GORILLA'S VOCALIZATIONS DURING REST PERIODS: SIGNALS OF IMPENDING DEPARTURE? KELLY J. STEWART and ALEXANDER H. HARCOURT Dept. of Anthropology, University of California at Davis, Davis, CA, 95616, U.S.A. Animal signals have been interpreted as indicating something about the signaller's internal state and hence its subsequent behaviour, while at the same time eliciting a response from the receiver. Such signals are often given when the costs and benefits of an action depend on what others do. This interpretation of meaning and function of signals has been applied primarily to ritualized competitive or courtship displays. Here we use the approach to analyse another context of signalling and a more subtle communicatory behav- iour. Gorillas live in small cohesive groups whose synchronized activities alternate between travel/feeding periods and resting periods. We present data on gorillas' vocalizations - the grunts - prior to a coor- dinated departure from a rest period. We suggest that gorillas use these signals to indicate their readiness to depart and to assess that readiness in others. Vocal activity increased significantly towards the end of rest periods, due both to individuals calling at higher rates, and to a greater number of vocalizers. This increase in vocal activity was not associated with a greater clumping of animals, nor with an increase in non-rest activities, and therefore appeared to be related to subsequent departure. The frequent exchange of grunts supports the notion that gorillas might use the calls of others to asses their readiness to depart. 972</page><page sequence="331">VOLUME 130 973 We speculate that such signalling could function to synchronize the behaviour of group members and lead to coordinated group movement. Behaviour Vol. 130 (1994) pp. 41-52 SENSITIVITY TO INFORMATION SPECIFYING THE LINE OF GAZE OF HUMANS IN SPARROWS (PASSER DOMESTICUS) ROBERT R. HAMPTON Department of Psychology, Macalester College, St. Paul, MN 55105, U.S.A. For species with frontal eye placement, looking at an object usually involves orienting the face and eyes toward the object. Thus, the face and eyes of the looker are usually visible from the point occupied by the object or individuals being observed. Since many predators control their attacks with vision it is of interest to determine whether prey animals are responsive to information that specifies the orientation of other animals' visual systems. To determine whether wild-caught sparrows are sensitive to the looking behaviour of other animals, they were exposed to the experimenter's head held at various orientations relative to the birds. Aspects of the experimenter's visage, as well as that of an artificial face, were manipulated in order to identify the features of the human face relevant to the perception of line of gaze. Sparrow responded most strongly while the face of the experimenter was oriented toward them, but were indifferent to the direction in which the eyes gazed. Tests using a model human face showed that sparrows are responsive to changes in the number of visible eyes, but not to changes in the symmetry of the nose between the eyes.

Girard Ave., Philadelphia, PA 19104, U.S.A. We report the first field study of the intra-group vocal behaviour of golden lion tamarins (Leontopithecus rosalia). We present the contexts in which the five predominant intra-group vocalizations (cluck, whine, wah-wah, tsick, and trill) were emitted, including the behavioural responses elicited from other group members, for 25 adult and subadult golden lion tamarins in five wild groups. No age (subadult versus adult), sex, age of nearest neighbour, and few group differences in call usage were identified. Each intra- group vocalization was associated with a specific ecological context; few vocalizations were produced during dyadic social interactions. Clucks predominated during foraging. Clucks were also relatively more common when the group was travelling, but the focal tamarin was stationary (not locomoting). Whines were more likely when the animal was in a travelling group, stationary, not foraging or locomoting, and when the nearest neighbour was further away than five m. Trills were almost exclusively emitted when a tamarin was leaping, and were a strong predictor of foraging upon landing. No change in the mean</page><page sequence="332">974 VOLUME 130 distance to the nearest neighbour was detected subsequent to the production of a cluck, whine or trill, although juveniles immediately approached to obtain food items when tsick calls were uttered. Wah- wahs were more likely when the caller was on the group periphery and may function in the initiation and leading of group movement; a stationary group usually moved in the trajectory predicted by the wah-wahing tamarin's location relative to the group center. These findings suggest that the intra-group vocalizations of this small arboreal primate provide honest information regarding numerous aspects of the caller's immediate location, activity and intent. Directly and indirectly these vocalizations may function to facilitate group cohesion and the coordination of group movement by enhancing cooperation among group members. Behaviour Vol. 130 (1994) pp. 77-112 POLYCHROMATIC MIDAS CICHLIDS RESPOND TO DUMMY OPPONENTS: COLOR, CONTRAST AND CONTEXT GEORGE W. BARLOW and PAUL SIRI Department of Integrative Biology and Museum of Vertebrate Zoology University of California, Berkeley, U.S.A. Dummies allow the analysis of the effects of striking visual traits free of the confounding variation and interaction seen in live stimuli. In the Midas cichlid ('Cichlasoma' citrinellum), gold morphs (G) dominate normal (N) ones, apparently because an all-gold fish is a 'supernormal releaser' of fear. Although in other fish a dummy that looks like a territory holder or a dominant individual usually evokes the most aggressive response, we wondered whether the gold color was special and would depress aggressiveness. If so, when shown four differently colored passive dummies, gold ones would be approached and attacked least. The other three colors, all naturally occurring, were gray, white and black. Based on earlier, indirect evidence, we predicted that the N and G subjects would not differ in their responses, nor would males and females. We found that gold dummies were attacked at the highest rate, not the lowest, but all dummies were approached about equally. G and N subjects did not differ, nor did males and females based on attack rates. Females, however, spent more time close to the dummies than did males, possibly prospecting for a mate. To 'calibrate' the responses, we then presented to male subjects dummies colored gold, gray, and two novel colors, green and blue. The dummies were attacked from most to least in that order. The novel colors produced greater differences in responses than did colors normally found in the Midas cichlid. Other tests using dummies altered the position of the gold patch that is normally found on the throat, eye color, eye position, proportion of body colored gold, and species-typical markings; a patch of gold covering just the face was particularly evocative. The response to G may depend on whether the encounter is symmetrical or asymmetrical. Gold and gray dummies that threatened back were alternated with passive ones of the same color. Reactive gold and gray dummies were attacked at the highest rates and about equally; they were approached less than were the passive dummies, however. The results of testing with dummies can produce contrary results depending on whether the dummy is reactive or passive, and on the color of the background. Behaviour Vol. 130 (1994) pp. 113-122 THE RESPONSE OF NAIVE BREEDING ADULTS OF THE SPOTTED SALAMANDER TO FISH OWEN J. SEXTON and CHRISTOPHER A. PHILLIPS Department of Biology, Washington University, St. Louis, MO 63130, U.S.A. ERIC ROUTMAN Department of Anatomy, Washington University, St. Louis, MO 63130, U.S.A. Several recent investigations have shown that some species of salamanders are capable of perceiving the presence of fish in breeding ponds through olfaction. It has been suggested that breeding adult sala- manders may avoid depositing eggs in pools containing fish. We examined the hypothesis that breeding salamanders avoid fish ponds through olfactory cues in two field tests. In the first, naive spotted sala- manders (Ambystoma maculatum) restrained within screened enclosures were submerged in either fish or fishless ponds. The number of eggs laid within each enclosure was counted at the conclusion of breed- ing. There was no difference in the number of eggs within and among four fishless and three fish ponds. In the fourth fish pond the fish harassed the salamanders and completely inhibited reproduction. We re- peated the experiment using double screened enclosures in which the salamanders were free from direct</page><page sequence="333">VOLUME 130 975 fish attack but were still exposed to fish scent. There was no difference in egg production. The sec- ond test repeated the design of the first but provided the salamanders with the choice of remaining in the double screened enclosures or exiting the pond. The test animals from both the fish and fishless ponds responded similarly in their breeding activities. We conclude that naive spotted salamanders do not avoid fish ponds based solely on olfactory cues. Behaviour Vol. 130 (1994) pp. 123-142 FLUCTUATIONS IN INTRA-PAIR CALLING ACROSS BREEDING PHASES IN NORTHERN MOCKINGBIRDS (MIMUS POLYGLOTTOS) CHERYL A. LOGAN Department of Psychology, University of North Carolina at Greensboro, Greensboro, NC 27412-5001, U.S.A. When in close proximity, mated mockingbirds (Mimus polyglottos) often exchange a broad band "hew" call. The call is also produced by lone males and females. I observed single hew production and intra-pair hew exchange across three breeding conditions: when adults were only feeding young, when the male was nest building with no young present, and when the male nest building in the presence of young still being fed by the pair. Fewer calls of either type were produced during nest construction, and the relative frequency of each call pattern differed among breeding conditions. The percentage of pair interactions with hew exchange dropped while pairs were nest building, while the percentage of interactions accompanied by single hews increased during nest construction. Moreover, when only one member of the pair called (single hews), it was almost always the female. During nest building with young present, more pair interactions were accompanied by hew exchange than when pairs built in the absence of young, and in pairs nest building with young present, the number of hew exchanges per 60 min was positively correlated with brood size. Patterns of behavioural interaction between males and females also differed across the three breeding conditions. While feeding young, males approached females more than females approached males, and during nest building, males departed from females more than the reverse. Moreover, the responses of each sex were affected by breeding phase. Females departed first more while feeding than while nest building, and males approached first more while feeding than while nest building. More follows occurred during nest construction than during feeding, and females followed males somewhat more during nest building than during feeding. These data suggest that 1) hews directed within the pair reflect intra-pair aggression; 2) a drop in hew exchange may signal increased readiness to renest; 3) males may be ready to renest before females, who continue to call after males stop; and 4) readiness to renest may be affected by the presence of dependent young.

The strength of male affiliations was attributed to differences in between group competition for access to groups of females, while the type of male dominance relationships was attributed to dif- ferences in within group competition for access to individual females. Female grouping patterns and the socionomic sex ratio appeared to be more important than group size in predicting the strength of between group competition and male affiliations. Male dominance over females appeared to be more important than estrus synchrony in predicting the type of within group competition and the presence of hierarchical or egalitarian relationships among males. Behaviour Vol. 130 (1994) pp. 169-190 MIGRATION ALLIANCES AND COALITIONS AMONG ADULT MALE SOUTH AMERICAN SQUIRREL MONKEYS (SAIMIRI SCIUREUS) CAROL L. MITCHELL Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08544, U.S.A. 1. Male South American squirrel monkeys form groups whose composition remains stable over migrations between troops. These groups are called 'migration alliances'. 2. Members of migration alliances support one another against other males through coalitions in genital display bouts both during immigration and throughout the year. Male alliances do not function to overcome female dominance. 3. Seasonal reproduction in squirrel monkeys may influence male alliances by a) intensification of within- group competition during the mating season, and b) production of temporally and spatially fluctuating mating opportunities between groups.

Box 289, Poolesville, MD 20837, U.S.A. Remarkably close male bonding exists among Costa Rican squirrel monkeys, Saimiri oerstedi. In this population males were philopatric, exhibited no male-male within-troop aggression, and only very slight evidence for a dominance hierarchy. Juvenile, young and full adult males were spatially clumped in same-age male cohorts. A less intense, secondary association was also shown between the young and full adult male cohorts. These associations were most dense over a spatial scale of 5 m or less, but can also be detected in a 5-10 m distance from a focal male. Males also cooperated in 1) sexual investigation of females during the mating season, 2) aggressive interactions with males of neighboring troops, and 3) valiant defense of infants and subadults from potential predators. In contrast, the spatial association among adult females never exceeded random expectations and only a transitory period of cooperation was observed among mothers during the birth season. Furthermore, there was little evidence of bonds between the sexes. Seasonal variation in affiliation patterns was best explained by fluctuations in food availability and, secondarily, reproductive activity. These results are surprising both from the perspective of the general pattern of male affiliation among primates and the often marked aggression and dominance relationships among males documented in captive and wild populations of South American squirrel monkeys. The ultimate explanation is suggested to be the disparate distribution of fruit resources exploited by South and Central American squirrel monkeys, mediated by effects on female affiliation and dispersal patterns.</page><page sequence="335">VOLUME 130 977 Behaviour Vol. 130 (1994) pp. 211-228 VARIATION IN MALE RELATIONSHIPS IN BONOBOS AND CHIMPANZEES TAKESHI FURUICHI Laboratory of Biology, Meiji-Gakuin University, 1518 Kamikurata, Totsuka, Yokohama, 244 Japan HIROSHI IHOBE Department of Zoology, Faculty of Science, Kyoto University, Inuyama, Aichi, 484 Japan 1. Inter-male relationships were compared between two groups of bonobos at Wamba, Zaire, and a group of chimpanzees at the Mahale Mountains, Tanzania. 2. Although distribution of females is much different between the two species, frequencies of affinitive interactions between males (inter-individual proximity and grooming) were similar between the species. 3. By contrast, marked inter-species differences were found in agonistic aspects of male relationships. Such differences could be related to the different estrus patterns of females. 4. Male relationships of both species may have been reflecting the male-bonded strategy which was taken by a common ancestor. Within this framework, males of each species seem to have developed differentiated social tactics for the access to females showing different patterns of distribution and estrus.

On the one hand, party size fluctuates in a randomlike fashion and party membership is unpredictable; on the other hand, funfamental party structures are apparent; males are often in all-male parties whereas females remain mostly solitary. The customary sociobiological explanation is based on the assumptions that 1) competition for food favors solitariness (especially in females); 2) chimpanzee males share the costs of territorial defense against rivals from neighbouring communities and 3) genetical relatedness among males within a community compensates for fitness losses due to their competition for food and females. We point to some theoretical flaws in the reasoning that forms the basis of the current neo-Darwinistic model and to the lack of empirical data concerning male relatedness. Most importantly, chimpanzee-like party structures emerge by self-organisation in an artificial "world" in which "CHIMPs" do nothing more than searching for food and mates, without requiring any of the assumptions of the sociobiological model.

Temminck's red colobus (Procolobus badius temminckii) living in the Abuko Nature Reserve, The Gambia, have more prominent female-female bonds and less prominent male-male bonds than has been described in most other female-transfer, male-resident groups. This may be due to a number of factors such as female peer-group transfer, the small number of groups available to a transferee, the lack of sexual dimorphism, and the presence and important of females in initiating and defending the social integrity of the social unit. It is clear from this that the presence of female-transfer, male-residence patterns is not always enough to automatically predict strong male-male bonds. Other factors must also be considered.</page><page sequence="336">978 VOLUME 130 Behaviour Vol. 130 (1994) pp. 271-292 SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS OF MALE BONNET MACAQUES: MALE BONDING IN A MATRILINEAL SOCIETY JOAN B. SILK Department of Anthropology, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90024; California Primate Research Center, University of California, Davis, California 95616, U.S.A. Affiliative and cooperative relationships are not common among mammalian males. This may be partly the result of sexual selection which favors competitive and agonistic interactions among mature males, and partly the result of the fact that female mammals are generally philopatric. This means that adult males usually live among unrelated and unfamiliar individuals. Bonnet macaques (Macaca radiata) represent one of several exceptions to this general pattern. Adult males in this species frequently sit together, groom, huddle, greet, and support one another. The nature of social relationships among males are related to their participation in coalitions as males tend to support the males with whom they associate and interact affiliatively, and intervene against the males with whom they generally exchange greetings and aggression.

A survey of the literature indicated that affiliative behaviour between males is more widespread than has been supposed. 2. Factors were examined which may influence the nature of relations between adult males. In all macaque species for which there are adequate data, males commonly move between groups, making it unlikely that kinship between adult males is an important factor in natural groups. 3. Affiliative behaviour between adult males is more frequently observed in small groups, with sex ratios closer to parity, than in large groups with more uneven sex ratios. Two factors are thought to influence this association. First, most large groups with highly skewed sex ratios were provisioned. Provisioning results in increased levels of aggression and tension, which may preclude the formation of affiliative relationships. Second, in groups with highly skewed sex ratios males can find many potential grooming partners among the females and their offspring. Where the sex ratio is more even there may be a shortage of potential partners among the natal animals, and males may form relationships with other males as an alternative. 4. Much of our knowledge of macaque societies has come from provisioned populations. Findings made under such conditions must be verified with data from natural populations, wherever possible, especially where competition may have an influence on the patterns of behaviours observed. Behaviour Vol. 130 (1994) pp. 309-337 MALE BONDS: AFILLIATIVE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG NONHUMAN PRIMATE MALES JAN A.R.A.M. VAN HOOFF Ethologie &amp; Socio-oecologie Groep, Universiteit Utrecht, Utrecht, the Netherlands CAREL P. VAN SCHAIK Biological Anthropology &amp; Anatomy, Duke University, Durham NC, U.S.A. A deductively obtained model concerning the factors that determine male social relationships within the framework of primate social organization is discussed in the light of existing empirical evidence. Tolerance and affiliative bonding are expected to occur less easily between male than between female primates. Whereas females compete for resources such as food, males in addition compete to obtain fertilizations. Unlike food, fertilizations cannot easily be shared. This undoubtedly hampers the formation of male coalitions and the development of male bonds. Indeed, male tolerance tends to be low especially in species where the spatial and temporal distribution of females is such that individual males may monopolize access to such females, thus facilitating inter-male contest. Nevertheless there are a number</page><page sequence="337">VOLUME 130 979 of species in which tolerance between adult male group members is remarkable. In some cases forms of coordination and mutual attraction exist that justify qualification of 'male bonding'. An important factor supposed to conduce to the development of male bonding is the inclusive fitness benefit that support and tolerance between male relatives may bring. This would occur especially where circumstances permit male philopatry. The latter is expected in species where the nature of female competition for basic resources does not lead to strong female-bondedness and female nepotism, allowing females to become allopatric. There is evidence from various species that related males form bonds under the mentioned conditions. A special case of this is the formation of father-son bonds, noted in species with strong intermale contest and corresponding sexual dimorphism. A remarkable alternative, by the way, is the existence of mother-son bonds which last into adulthood and which contribute to a male's position. There are indications for such bonds in two species where males stay with their mother and where sexual dimorphism is low. Still kinship clearly is not a necessary factor for the development of male tolerance and of support between males. The factor does not play a role, for instance, in the short-term coalitions found in baboons. Here opportunism based on mutual or reciprocal benefits seems to play a decisive role. The evidence presented lends support to the idea that there is an order of priorities, in which, first, socioecological factors determine the spatial, hierarchical and affiliative relationships between females. These female relationships then set the scene for the males, in that these determine the options left open for the males to organize their patterns of competition, migration and bonding.</page><page sequence="338">980 VOLUME 131 Behaviour Vol. 131 (1994) pp. 1-18 HUNTING DECISIONS IN WILD CHIMPANZEES CRAIG B.

ESLOM MPONGO Gombe Stream Research Centre, Box 185, Kigoma, Tanzania JANE GOODALL Department of Anthropology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089, USA; Box 727, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania While field studies of wild chimpanzees have investigated the proximate determinants of hunting success, little attention has been paid to the decision to hunt. We present evidence from Gombe National Park, Tanzania, showing that the social factors that most strongly influence the decision to hunt red colobus monkeys are the presence of female chimpanzees with anogenital sexual swellings in the foraging party, the number of adult and adolescent males in the party, and the total size of the foraging party. Of these, the presence of one or more swollen females was the best predictor of a decision to undertake hunts of red colobus groups at all but the smalles chimpanzee foraging party size. Two likely explanations for this pattern are discussed. First, swollen females may be a primary influence on male grouping patterns, which in turn promotes hunting. Second, this finding, together with previous research showing that male chimpanzees preferentially give meat to estrous females, suggests that male chimpanzee hunting performance may be under sexual selection. While nutritional and ecological factors may influence chimpanzee hunting patterns at times, chimpanzees appear to hunt red colobus at least partially to obtain meat for use as a social and reproductive tool. Behaviour Vol. 131 (1994) pp. 19-38 STIMULI ELICITING DISTRESS CALLS IN ADULT PASSERINES AND RESPONSE OF PREDATORS AND BIRDS TO THEIR BROADCAST MICHAEL R. CONOVER Department of Fisheries and Wildlife, Utah State University, Logan, Utah 84322-5210, U.S.A. This study examined the response of birds and captive predators to the broadcast of distress calls and the effect of different stimuli on the elicitation of these calls. In doing so, this study tested two hypothe- ses about why adult passerines should distress call when physically constrained: the calls are designed 1) to attract attention, or 2) to startle the predator into releasing the caller. Birds often responded to both interspecific and intraspecific distress calls by approaching the sound source, but they rarely mobbed or engaged in any behavior that would aid the caller in escaping. The playback of a distress call had little effect on most captive opossums (Didelphis marsupialis) and raccoons (Procyon lotor) which were attack- ing a caged starling (Sturnus vulgaris). However, distress calls startled one opossum and two raccoons and provoked two other raccoons into a more severe attack. Birds only distress called when physically constrained. All passerine species that were tested, except brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater), emit- ted distress calls, but in no species did every individual call. Distress calls usually were of short duration, interrupted by periods of silence, and paired with struggling behavior. Birds were more likely to distress call when held by the limbs rather than the body or neck, when moved, or when viewing a rapidly ap- proaching object. These results indicate that one function of distress calls for most passerines is to startle the predator, but that other functions also are likely. My results also support the hypothesis that birds approach a distress caller to acquire information about the predator that has captured the caller.</page><page sequence="339">VOLUME 131 981 Behaviour Vol. 131 (1994) pp. 39-64 THE PROCESS OF SYLLABLE ACQUISITION IN ADULT INDIGO BUNTINGS (PASSERINA CYANEA) DANIEL MARGOLIASH, CYNTHIA STAICER and SUE A. INOUE Department of Organismal Biology and Anatomy, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60637, USA Vocal learning in adult indigo buntings was studied by monitoring socially paired males housed together in sound isolation boxes. Two of three yearlings socially paired with older birds in early spring acquired new syllables and reorganized their stereotyped and plastic songs, while eleven yearlings socially paired later in the year largely failed to acquire new material, as did the older adults socially paired at various times of year. Yearlings changed their stereotyped songs to more closely match their tutors' by replacing syllables or by inserting new syllables. This song matching involved two processes in which adult plastic song played a role: (1) new syllables were development in plastic song, and (2) newly mastered or pre-existing syllables were transferred from plastic song into stereotyped song. Morphological similarity between yearlings' and tutors' syllables strongly influenced which syllables yearlings retained. After social pairing, matching syllables tended to be delivered more frequently by yearlings and become incorporated into their stereotyped songs, while non-matching syllables tended to decline in use or be discarded altogether. New syllables were formed from existing syllables most morphologically similar to the "target" syllable, through transformation and combination of existing syllables. As new forms became more common, old forms declined and eventually were discarded. Our data suggest that adult indigo buntings maintain the ability to sing stereotyped songs while new material is mastered, and held in reserve, in plastic song. Acquisition of new syllables in yearling indigo buntings requires trial-and-error learning, but proceeds without overproduction and subsequent attrition of distinct syllable types, and does not substantially rely on improvisation and invention. Rather, syllable acquisition and changes to stereotyped songs are strongly influenced by the pre-existing syllable repertoire.

TARSITANO Sussex Centre for Neuroscience, University of Sussex, Brighton, Falmer, East Sussex, BNI 9QG, UK R.R. JACKSON Department of Zoology, University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand The terms "reversed-route detours" and "forward-route detours" are introduced to distinguish between detours that require moving away from a goal and those that do not. We provide the first evidence under controlled laboratory conditions that salticids can perform reversed-route detours. Two species were tested: 1) Portiafimbriata, a web-invading salticid from Queensland, Australia, that normally preys on web-building spiders; 2) Trite planiceps, an insectivorous cursorial salticid from New Zealand. Although both of these species completed reversed-route detours. Trite planiceps was much more dependent on prey movement than Portia fimbriata. Interspecific differences appear to be related to the different predatory styles of these two salticids.

Rhesus and stumptail infants were active earlier than pigtail infants, and rhesus mothers further encouraged infant independence by frequently breaking contact with them and rejecting them. Rhesus mothers also restrained their infants, presumably in circumstances where a danger for them was perceived. Pigtail mothers were more protective than rhesus mothers and not as encouraging of infant independence as rhesus mothers. Stumptail mothers scored low on both protectiveness and rejection measures. The functional significance of some differences in mother-infant relationships is tentatively explained on the basis of reproductive, ecological, and social characteristics of rhesus, pigtail, and stumptail macaques. Data on scratching behavior support the hypothesis that behavioral differences among macaque species are associated, at the proximate level, with differences in temperament or emotional reactivity. Behaviour Vol. 131 (1994) pp. 97-114 MOTHER-INFANT RELATIONSHIPS IN THREE SPECIES OF MACAQUES (MACACA MULATTA, M. NEMESTRINA, M. ARCTOIDES). II. THE SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT DARIO MAESTRIPIERI Department of Psychology and Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center, Emory University, 2409 Taylor Lane, Lawrenceville, GA 30243, U.S.A. This study compared social interactions between mothers, infants, and other group members in rhesus, pigtail, and stumptail macaques living in large captive social groups. Mother-infant pairs were focally observed in 4 weekly 30-min sessions for the first 12 weeks of infant life. Rhesus and pigtail mothers were remarkably similar in several contact, proximity, and grooming measures, but their scores were lower than those of stumptail mothers. The three species did not differ quantitatively in interest shown in infants by others group members, as measured by infant handling and grooming. Infant handling in stumptail macaques was always gentle and infants were carefully avoided by other group members when off their mothers. Infant handling in rhesus and pigtail macaques also involved harassment and kidnapping. The frequency of infant harassment did not differ in rhesus and pigtail macaques but harassment was more severe in the former than in the latter species. Rhesus mothers reacted aggressively to a higher proportion of infant handling attempts than pigtail stumptail mothers. These results confirm the hypotheses that female interest in infants does not differ among macaque species and that the quality of infant handling is a good predictor of interspecies differences in maternal protectiveness. Mothering style, however, is probably multidimensionally determined, and to fully understand interspecies differences in mother- infant relationships and their functional significance, we need to understand the mechanisms by which reproductive and ecological variables influence maternal behavior and infant development in primates. Behaviour Vol. 131 (1994) pp. 115-138 DAWN SINGING IN THE GREAT TIT (PARUS MAJOR): MATE ATTRACTION, MATE GUARDING, OR TERRITORIAL DEFENCE? TORE SLAGSVOLD, SVEIN DALE and GLENN-PETER SAETRE Department of Biology, University of Oslo, P.O. Box 1050, Blindern, N-0316 Oslo, Norway In a number of passerine bird species, mated males sing at dawn and this song activity peaks in the fertile period of the male. We present the hypothesis that an important function of such dawn singing is to maintain the territory. We suggest that mate guarding and territorial defence are demanding and often mutually exclusive activities. Losing paternity is so costly that males give priority to mate guarding. Males therefore use the early morning period, before their mate emerges from the roost, to claim territory ownership. We report some preliminary tests of this hypothesis from a study of great tits (Parus major). Simulating male intrusion by a playback experiment showed that the resident male was more often absent from central parts of the territory, following the mate, during the periods of nest building and egg laying than during incubation. This supports the assumption of conflicting demands between mate following and territorial defence. From the hypothesis we expected males to spend effort in defending their territory as soon as they were free to do so. Consistent with this prediction, we found that male song activity was high before the mate left the nest at dawn, when she temporarily visited the nest during the day, and when she entered the nest to roost at night. A female removal experiment showed that unmated males, having no mate to guard, sang as much at dawn as mated males. Only one of the eight widowed males succeeded to replace their mate. We discuss some alternative functions of dawn singing in the great tit, such as attraction of own mate, a replacement mate, and extra-pair mates. We conclude that the hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, and song may serve multiple purposes.</page><page sequence="341">VOLUME 131 983 Behaviour Vol. 131 (1994) pp. 139-152 ARE CHEMICAL CUES AS EFFECTIVE AS PUP CONTACT FOR INDUCING PATERNAL BEHAVIOUR IN MEADOW VOLES ANNE E. STOREY and CAROLYN J. WALSH Department of Psychology, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada AlB 3X9 We tested what social cues mediate the transition from non-parental behavior in male meadow voles, based on our previous findings that postpartum interaction with mate and pups was the most effective social experience for making males paternal. Males housed with their mates and pups for a day were more paternal and less aggressive to unrelated pups than males removed from their mates before parturition. Males housed with their mates, but with the litter removed, interacted with pups but were initially as likely to be aggressive as males with no exposure to mates and pups. These results suggest that the mate facilitates interaction with pups, but exposure to pups accelerates the sensitization process. Twenty-four hours of exposure to chemical cues from the mate and pups (mother and litter in cage with wire mesh floor suspended above male's cage) eliminated male aggression towards pups, but physical contact was necessary to enhance positive interactions with pups. Exposure to chemical cues from parturient mates reduced aggression, whereas cues from non-mates were not effective. These results may explain our previous findings that females keep sires removed during pregnancy out of the nest for about a day after reintroduction (while males become sensitized via chemosignals), and continue repelling unfamiliar males (that would not be sensitized by chemical cues from non-mates). Behaviour Vol. 131 (1994) pp. 153-170 VIGILANCE IN AFRICAN MAMMALS: DIFFERENCES AMONG MOTHERS, OTHER FEMALES, AND MALES JOANNA BURGER Biological Sciences, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA MICHAEL GOCHFELD Environmental and Community Medicine, UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Piscataway, NJ 08854, USA The time devoted to eating, vigilance (or scanning), walking and aggression was studied in one-minute focal animal samples as a function of sex, age, and motherhood for several African animals including African elephant, Burchell's zebra, Cape buffalo, Defassa water-buck, impala, and Uganda kob. Between 24 and 45 percent of the variation in vigilance behavior was accounted for by location (center or edge of herd), sex, age and whether a female had young. Time of day entered the linear multiple regression models for two species, and surprisingly group size did not enter any of the linear multiple regression models in 1993. In general, females with young were more vigilant than their young or females without young. There were few gender differences in vigilance among animals without young, except that male zebra, wildebeest and waterbuck were more vigilant than females. Animals on the edge of herds devoted more time to vigilance than intermediate or central animals (regardless of sex or age class). Although there was no relationship between group size and vigilance in 1993 when all herds were considered, there was a decrease in vigilance with increasing herd size for impala and kob for herds less than 50. Moveover, herd size and vigilance were negatively correlated in our 1984-1985 study, due partly to differences in group sizes. In 1984-1985 animals were not migrating, and were in relatively small, discrete groups, whereas in 1993 some species were migrating in large herds that stretched for several km. We suggest that in 1993 herd size was above a threshold where increases in group size can lead to further decreases in vigilance. Under these circumstances, location in the herd becomes paramount: Outside animals can be directly exposed to attack. Consequently animals on the edge devote more time to vigilance than central animals.</page><page sequence="342">984 VOLUME 131 Behaviour Vol. 131 (1994) pp. 171-188 COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF TIME SPENT GROOMING BY BIRDS IN RELATION TO PARASITE LOAD PETER COTGREAVE and DALE H. CLAYTON A.F.R.C. Unit of Ecology and Behaviour, Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford OXI 3PS, U.K. Although grooming and other kinds of maintenance activity are important components of the behavioural repertoire of terrestrial vertebrates, comparative studies of the proportion of time budgets devoted to main- tenance are lacking. Data were collated on the proportion of their time-budgets devoted to maintenance behaviour by 62 different bird species. On average, birds spend 9.2% of the day in maintenance activ- ities, with the major component 92.6% being grooming. Male birds devoted more time to maintenance than females, except in the case of ducks. Maintenance time does not appear to correlate with morphol- ogy, moult, latitude, coloniality or season. However, bird species known to harbour more parasitic louse species spend more time on maintenance than do host species with few lice. Behaviour Vol. 131 (1994) pp. 189-206 FEMALE PREFERENCE FOR NESTS WITH EGGS IS BASED ON THE PRESENCE OF THE EGGS THEMSELVES SARAH B.M. KRAAK and TON G.G. GROOTHUIS Zoological Laboratory, University of Groningen, P.O. Box 14, 9750 AA Haren, the Netherland In many fish species of which males care for eggs in a nest, including Aidablennius sphynx, females prefer to mate with males that already guard eggs. In this paper we present two aquarium experiments with this Mediterranean blenny to determine whether the females actually use the presence of eggs as a cue or depend on male display behaviour signalling the presence of eggs. In experiment 1 the test-female was presented with two nests, one with eggs and one without eggs, and only one male in a closed container between the two nests. This male only served to stimulate the female. In all tests females preferred to lay eggs in the nest already containing eggs. This shows that females of this species can base their choice on the presence of the eggs alone. In experiment 2 the test-female was presented with two males in nests of which only one had eggs. Transparent partitions deprived the female of the opportunity to inspect the nest contents. The male with and the male without eggs did not differ in time spent displaying towards the female, and the female did not show a preference for either male, based on visual cues or odours. After removal of the partitions the female visited both nests. The nest she visited first was equally likely to be the nest without eggs as the nest with eggs. In contrast, the female finally deposited eggs preferentially in the nest with eggs. We conclude that in this experiment females did not base their preference for males with eggs on male behaviour, but on the nest contents after inspection. This does not exclude an influence of male behaviour under other conditions. Furthermore, females generally deposit their eggs adjacent to as many as possible of the eggs already present, suggesting that females can localize and possibly estimate the amount of eggs already present.

FORESTER Biological Sciences/Institute of Animal Behavior, Towson State University, Towson, Maryland 21204, USA Each of 32 male, Dendrobates pumilio (red phase) were allowed to establish a territory in one half of a 40 liter aquarium. Each enclosure contained a substrate of Sphagnum, a potted plant, and a water dish. Males occupying the same aquarium were prevented from seeing one another by an opaque barrier. In the first experiment, residents were presented with a conspecific intruder matched for size and color. Based on a numerical index of aggression, residents were consistently dominant over intruders. When reciprocal trials were conducted, the results were reversed (i.e. residents were dominant over males to which they previously had been subordinate). The success of resident males was not influenced by the size of conspecific intruders. In addition, residents consistently dominated a sympatric confamilial</page><page sequence="343">VOLUME 131 intruder (Phyllobates lugubris). Removal experiments revealed that resident males recognize and defend their enclosures after 3, and to a lesser degree, 6 days of isolation. We also examined the effect of territorial markers on the prior residence effect by stepwise removal of the plant and Sphagnum. Residents aggressively defended enclosures in both experiments. When Spagnum was removed from the resident's enclosures and placed in a previously unused aquaria, 7 of 10 males exhibited dominance over conspecific intruders. Behaviour Vol. 131 (1994) pp. 225-260 EFFECTS OF THE AROMATASE INHIBITOR R76713 ON SEXUAL DIFFERENTIATION OF BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR IN ZEBRA FINCHES JACQUES BALTHAZART, PHILLIPE ABSIL and VERONIQUE FIASSE Laboratory of General and Comparative Biochemistry, 17 place Delcour, University of Liege, Liege, Belgium GREGORY F. BALL Department of Psychology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21218, USA Neonatal estradiol injections masculinize both the singing behavior and some morphological aspects of the song control nuclei in female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata), but there is to date no physiological evidence that estrogens are responsible for the differentiation of song and the song control nuclei in male zebra finches during normal ontogeny. Injections of estrogen into young males demasculinizes their copulatory behavior, so that it is difficult to understand how the same endocrine environment could simultaneously masculinize song and demasculinize copulation. Attempts to block early estrogen action in males have resulted in a paradoxical hypermasculinization of several aspects of the song control nuclei. In the present experiment, we tried to evaluate the role played by estrogens during zebra finch differentiation by blocking their secretion with the non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor, R76713 or racemic vorozole. Zebra finches received at 2-3 days post-hatch one Silastic implant filled with R76713 or left empty as a control. Implants were left in place until about 45 days of age birds were then gonadectomized. At the age of 105 days, all birds received a Silastic implant filled with T and, starting two weeks later, they were repeatedly tested for singing and copulatory behavior during a period of 3 weeks. They were then perfused and their brains were analyzed by histological methods to measure the volume of the song control nuclei, HVc, RA, area X and MAN. Treatment with R76713 significantly decreased (±50%) the number of song bouts produced by the birds but did not affect the copulatory behavior of the males. The behavior of females was not changed by the aromatase inhibitor and, in particular, no increase in mounting behavior was seen in the treated females. The presence of a strong sex dimorphism in the size of all 4 song control nuclei was confirmed but no significant effect of R76713 on these measures could be detected. These data are therefore consistent with the idea that estrogens are implicated in the differentiation of singing behavior in the zebra finch but the small amplitude of the behavioral effect observed and the absence of morphological effect suggest that either other factors also play a major role at this level or that higher doses or longer treatments with the aromatase blocker should be tested. Behaviour Vol. 131 (1994) pp. 261-276 COURTSHIP FOOD-CALLING IN BURMESE RED JUNGLEFOWL: I. THE CAUSATION OF FEMALE APPROACH HENDRIK S. VAN KAMPEN Department of Psychology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, M5S lAl Canada The present study was performed to examine why female Burmese red juglefowl (Gallus gallus spadiceus) approach a food-calling male. Females from three small groups were tested individually with a male under different conditions. Deprivation of food for 24 h did not affect the reaction of females to food-calling, showing that the feeding system is not crucially involved. This result makes it unlikely that courtship food-calling with inedible objects is a case of deception, as was suggested previously. Further it was shown that females willing to perform the sexual crouch and females low in the peck-order were more likely to approach food-calling. These factors were found to be interrelated and fear was suggested to play a crucial role both in inhibiting and modulating approach and in willingness to crouch. The data gathered on the involvement of the sexual system did not allow for any definite conclusions, but as an alternative it was suggested that females might approach courtship food-calling because it arouses curiosity, or, exploration. 985</page><page sequence="344">986 VOLUME 131 Behaviour Vol. 131 (1994) pp. 277-292 A NEW EXPERIMENT TO VERIFY THE SPATIAL RANGE OF PIGEONS' OLFACTORY MAP S.

In each test, a group of experimental birds, which had been prevented from smelling ambient odours during the passive displacement, was compared to a group of controls which always had free access to olfactory information. Our results show that the range of unfamiliar area where pigeons are able to navigate on the basis of local cues is rather limited (less than 120 km from the home loft). Homeward orientation, however, normally occurs beyond the limits of the olfactory map as the birds are able to use odorous cues perceived during the initial part of the outward journey. Our results are in agreement with the "mosaic" hypothesis of pigeons' olfactory navigation. Behaviour Vol. 131 (1994) pp. 293-304 VULNERABILITY TO PREDATION IN BABOON POPULATIONS GUY COWLISHAW Department of Anthropology, University College London, London WC1E 6BT, UK This study investigates patterns of predation in Papio baboon populations across Africa. Using anecdotal reports collated from the primate and predator literature, the following analyses are conducted. First, the primary predators of baboons are identified. These are shown to be the terrestrial carnivores; in order of importance leopards, lions and hyena. Second, patterns of large felid predation on baboons are investigated in detail. In terms of prey selection, leopards are more likely to take (1) adults than juveniles and (2) males than females. While lion attacks are strictly diurnal, leopards will attack during both the day and night. However, both predators are usually limited to conducting attacks when and/or where visibility is limited. Leopards were about twice as successful as lions at hunting baboons. Nocturnal leopard hunts were more successful than diurnal hunts when twilight cases were excluded: in relation to this, leopard attacks at sleeping sites were more likely to end in prey capture than attacks at waterholes. Finally, patterns of baboon retaliation against predators revealed that males are more likely to retaliate than females and that such behaviour effectively deters predators. Males are particularly aggressive towards leopards, where in 4/11 cases the leopard was killed. These results may help to resolve a number of outstanding controversies regarding the nature of predation risk in baboons, indicating that diurnal predation is a substantial threat, that males are effective at deterring several predator species, particularly leopards, and that predators will successfully attack and capture males.</page><page sequence="345">VOLUME 132 987 Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 1-20 DEVELOPMENT OF A SELECTIVE RESPONSE TO AN ADULT VOCALIZATION IN NESTLING BLACK-CAPPED CHICKADEES JANINE R. CLEMMONS Department of Zoology, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin 53706 U.S.A. There are many studies on how songbirds develop song production, but few on how songbirds develop appropriate responses to conspecific vocalizations. The black-capped chickadee, Parus atricapillus, pro- duces a vocalization, the 'squawk', that stimulates gaping in nestlings during feeding. To determine whether nestlings gape selectively at the squawk, playbacks of several conspecific vocalizations plus a heterospecific vocalization were presented to nestlings within natural nests. A preference for the squawk did not appear until day 2-3 and then steadily increased, until by day 11-13, nestlings gaped only at the squawk. To determine whether there are constraints on which vocalization can develop as the gaping stimulus, newly-hatched nestlings were reinforced with food for gaping either at the squawk or the faint feebee, the two most common adult vocalizations at the nestling site. Regardless of reinforcement, nestlings gaped most frequently at the squawk. In addition, after the first few days posthatch, nestlings became as responsive to a third, unreinforced, heterospecific vocalization as to the squawk. The responsiveness to the heterospecific vocalization coincided with the expanding range of auditory sensitivity that occurs at the same age during passerine development. Thus, while field observations show that nestlings gape mostly to the squawk relative to other parental vocalizations, experimental evidence indicates that there is not an exclusive link between the signal (squawk) and its response (gaping), especially during the first week posthatch when parents use the signal most frequently. Rather, an effectively selective response may be achieved redundantly by a variety of factors. Possible factors that are discussed include matching acoustic structure to nestling perceptual biases and the behavior of the parents, such as through the selective use of the squawk, use of structural contrast among signals closely associated with feeding, and controlling distance from and orientation toward the nestlings. Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 21-48 A DEMOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS OF MALE LIFE HISTORY AND SOCIAL STRUCTURE OF MOUNTAIN GORILLAS MARTHA M. ROBBINS Department of Zoology, Birge Hall, 430 Lincoln Drive, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706, U.S.A. Twenty-five years of demographic data on free-ranging mountain gorillas (Gorilla gorilla beringei) from the Karisoke Research Center, Rwanda were used to assess male life histories and the variation within the age-graded social structure. Group types include lone silverbacks, one-male, multimale, and all-male groups. Although 60% of gorilla groups in the Virunga population are one-male, a multimale structure may increase chances of survival and future reproductive success for males at three stages of their lives. Infants born in one-male groups appear more likely to die from infanticide than those in multimale groups. Immature males in one-male groups may face decreased future reproductive opportunities compared to males in multimale groups. Adult males in one-male groups lack possible partners for coalition formation during intergroup encounters. Demographic constraints, such as length of time to male maturation, coupled with intense male-male competition for mates may limit the number and duration of groups with a multimale structure. Individuals are not restricted to one group type for their entire adult lives and males that attain maturity in each group type may eventually reproduce. Variation in male reproductive success is based both on length of reproductive tenure and on the number of mates.</page><page sequence="346">988 VOLUME 132 Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 49-56 THE SELFISH CROUTON DANIEL FELS Zoologisches Institut, Rheinsprung 9, CH-4051 Basel, Switzerland ALUN AP RHISIART Zoologisches Institut, Rheinsprung 9, CH-4051 Basel, Switzerland; Department of Zoology, South Parks Road, Oxford OXI 3PS, England FRITZ VOLLRATH Zoologisches Institut, Rheinsprung 9, CH-4051 Basel, Switzerland; Department of Zoology, South Parks Road, Oxford OXI 3PS, England; Department of Zoology, University of Aarhus, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark We studied predator prey interactions on a model system with gulls as predators and bread croutons as prey. The advantage to prey grouping appeared even at low numbers of prey and high predator density. Moreover, individual predators gained by preying upon a group rather than on a solitary prey. Rate of predation was the same for homogeneous (unicoloured) and heterogeneous (multicoloured) groups of croutons. Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 57-74 INDIVIDUAL VARIATION IN FORAGING MOVEMENTS IN A LAKE POPULATION OF YOUNG-OF-THE-YEAR BROOK CHARR (SALVELINUS FONTINALIS) PETER A. BIRO and MARK S. RIDGWAY Harkness Laboratory of Fisheries Research, Aquatic Ecosystems Research Section, Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, Box 5000, Maple, Ontario, Canada, L6A 1S9 We examined the variation in foraging movements in a population of young-of-the-year (YOY) brook charr living in the near-shore littoral zone of a lake. By repeating the methodology of an earlier stream study, we made direct comparisons between data from lake and stream populations. In general, the pattern of variation in foraging movements was similar between the two sites with greater variability and activity observed in the lake population. The dichotomous nature of the proportion of time spent moving in the stream was also observed in the lake population but in a reversal of the stream pattern. Charr that moved constantly while foraging represented the largest movement category in the lake. In general, variation in foraging movements were more strongly related to the rate of prey rejection, whereas environmental factors, such as distance from shore, submerged objects, and the amount of overhead riparian cover, were more strongly related to prey ingestion. This last finding directly contrasts with that found in the stream literature for YOY charr in still water where ingestion rate, as estimated using feeding attempt rate, increases with the mobility of YOY charr. Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 75-86 BEHAVIOURAL PATTERNS IN BABOON GROUP ENCOUNTERS: THE ROLE OF RESOURCE COMPETITION AND MALE REPRODUCTIVE STRATEGIES GUY COWLISHAW Department of Anthropology, University College London, London WC1E 6BT, U.K. Female Between Group Contest BGC competition for limited and monopolizable ecological resources such as food and water is the conventional explanation for behaviour during primate intergroup encounters. It is further advocated as an explanation for the evolution of social groups. This paper tests this explanation (HI) against two competing hypotheses. These are that patterns of intergroup interaction represent (H2) BGC mediated through males or (H3) male reproductive strategies. Four predictions are generated from these hypotheses and tested with data from two sources: (1) a cross-population Papio baboon literature survey and (2) a population-specific chacma baboon Papio cynocephalus ursinus case study. This pop- ulation consisted of five groups (four habituated) in the semi-desert Pro-Namib region of Namibia. The predictions were: (P1) female OR male aggression dominates encounters, (P2) the number of females OR males determines the outcome of encounters, (P3) there is frequent aggression OR tolerance at resources</page><page sequence="347">VOLUME 132 989 during encounters, and (P4) males chase females away from their group OR into their group through herd- ing during group encounters. Tests of these predictions using both databases failed to support HI or H2, but did provide evidence in favour of H3; namely female aggression was absent, male aggression was infrequent and directed towards either infants of other groups or females of their own group in herding episodes, and encounters with displacements tended to occur only rarely and mostly where resources were either non-monopolizable or absent. These results imply that BGC is not currently a selective force main- taining baboon social groups in either the study population or other populations across Africa. In order to further investigate the complex behavioural patterns observed in baboon intergroup encounters, data describing the demography and relatedness of groups and individuals are required. Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 87-94 MIRROR IMAGE PATTERN MATCHING BY BUMBLE BEES Y.G. KORNELUK and C.M.S. PLOWRIGHT University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ont. KIN 6N5, Canada Bumble bees (Bombus impatiens) were trained to discriminate between a rewarding and nonrewarding artificial flower that differed only in their configuration of four identical petals. On choice tests between 2 empty flowers, the bees chose the flower with the configuration of the rewarding flower over the mirror image, but the mirror image over a novel flower. This behaviour is the same as has been observed with honey bees and functional interpretations are considered. The problem of distinguishing between left-right pattern reversals and true mirror image transformations is discussed. Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 95-106 AVOIDANCE RESPONSE BY ADULT NEWTS (CYNOPS PYRRHOGASTER AND NOTOPHTHALMUS VIRIDESCENS) TO CHEMICAL ALARM CUES GLENN A. MARVIN and VICTOR H. HUTCHISON Department of Zoology, University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK 73019, U.S.A. Many fishes and aquatic invertebrates use chemical alarm cues to avoid predation, however relatively little is known about the occurrence of chemical alarm cues in amphibians. We tested the response of adult fire-bellied newts (Cynops pyrrhogaster) and red-spotted newts (Notophthalmus viridescens) to chemical cues from damaged tissues of newts and other salamanders. Both species avoided chemical cues from a conspecific skin extract. Notophthalmus viridescens also avoided chemical cues from C. pyrrhogaster skin extract, but the converse was not true. Neither species avoided chemical cues from a conspecific viscera extract, plethodontid salamander (Desmognathus and Plethodon) skin extracts, or a conspecific skin extract which had been heated. These results indicate that the avoidance behaviour is an alarm response to chemical cues released from damaged newt skin and is not a general response to chemical cues from damaged salamander tissue. This study provides the best evidence to date for an avoidance response by caudate amphibians to chemical alarm cues.

Each resident occupied an aquarium containing a shelter for 24 hours prior to the initial intrusion. The winner of each encounter was</page><page sequence="348">990 VOLUME 132 determined, as well as the pair member that initiated the aggressive interaction, and the relation between the initiation of aggression and contest outcome. The results showed that: (1) Maternal female residents were winners in 92% of the encounters with male intruders, and initiated aggression in a significantly higher proportion of encounters than the male intruders. (2) Maternal female residents were the winners in 75% of the encounters with non-maternal female intruders. The maternal residents also initiated aggression in a significantly higher proportion of the encounters than the non-maternal intruders. (3) Non-maternal female residents lost 77% of the encounters with non-maternal intruders. Also, the non-maternal intruders initiated aggression in a significantly higher proportion of the encounters than did the non-maternal residents. (4) Non-maternal female residents lost all of their encounters with male intruders. However, there was no significant difference in the proportion of the encounters in which aggression was initiated by residents or intruders. (5) For all experiments combined, maternal residents won a significantly higher proportion of their en- counters than did non-maternal residents, regardless of whether the intruders were males or non- maternal females. (6) For the three experiments combined, the initiation of aggression reliably predicted contest outcome (i.e. the initiator of aggression ultimately won). The present results provide the first empirical demonstration, with appropriate non-maternal controls, of maternal aggression in decapod crustaceans. Also, the direct relation between reproductive status and contest outcome in both ovigerous and post-hatch P clarkii are the first such data reported in crustaceans, in general. Finally, the findings of these experiments bear notable similarities to the results of maternal aggression research in other taxonomic groups. Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 127-150 MALE AND FEMALE PARTNER PREFERENCES IN A CAPTIVE WOLF PACK (CANIS LUPUS): SPECIFICITY VERSUS SPREAD OF SEXUAL ATTENTION RUUD R.W.M. DERIX and JAN A.R.A.M. VAN HOOFF Ethology &amp; Socio-ecology Group, Utrecht University, PO Box 80086, 3508 TB Utrecht, The Netherlands Strong pair-bonding is typical for canids. In wolf packs consisting of several adult males and females, sexual interests may clash during the mating season. We expect that not only dominance-subordinance relationships but also partner preferences play a prominent role in the establishment of pair bonds in wolves. The objective of our study is to disentangle male and female components in the establishment of sexual relationships, and, in particular, the influence of partner preferences. A first-approach model suggests that males will attempt to maximize the number of fertilizations, whereas females will be selective in partner choice. We therefore determined behavioural measures of partner preference for each sex; namely 'Following sexually' in males and 'Presenting actively' in females. Matings corresponded more to the male than the female preferences. Males initiated courtship, whereas females influenced pair-bonding more by proceptive behaviour and by the rejection of male courtship. Whereas the dominant males focused more on one preferred female at a time, and might eventually switch and direct their preference to another female, the dominant females, and particularly the alpha female, spread their sexual interests over several males and associate with more than one male at a time. The ultimate reason for this might be that, in this way, a female promotes care-giving towards herself and her offspring by creating a 'paternity illusion' in those males. Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 151-162 FEMALE CHOICE IN THE MIDWIFE TOADS (ALYTES OBSTETRICANS AND A. CISTERNASII) RAFAEL MARQUEZ Departamento de Ecologia Evolutiva, Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales, Josd Gutierrez Abascal 2, 28006 Madrid, Spain A previous study reported that large males had greater mating success than small males in two species of midwife toads. A behavioural mechanism that would explain such a pattern is sought. Dominant frequency is inversely correlated with male size in Alytes obstetricans and A. cisternasii. In both cases,</page><page sequence="349">VOLUME 132 991 two-speaker playback tests with synthetic calls show that females have a significant preference for calls with low frequencies. The results shows that female preference may impose directional sexual selection upon a static acoustic character that is correlated with male size. Male Alytes tend their eggs on land, but male size is not correlated with hatching success. Therefore female preference for larger males does not appear to directly increase female fitness. Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 163-180 POD CHARACTERISTICS OF MIGRATING HUMPBACK WHALES (MEGAPTERA NOVAEANGLIAE) OFF THE EAST AUSTRALIAN COAST MIRANDA BROWN and PETER CORKERON Department of Veterinary Anatomy, The University of Sydney, N.S.W. 2006, Australia The size and sex composition of migrating humpback whale pods were investigated off the east Australian coast. Two hundred and thirty one singletons, 257 pairs, 63 trios, 7 quads and 4 pods containing more than 5 individuals were observed during two land-based surveys carried out throughout the northward migration in 1991 and 1993. Generally humpback whales migrated northward towards the breeding area in pods of 1 or 2 individuals. In 1992, a biopsy study was carried out throughout the northward and southward migrations. Pods migrating southward (mean -2.59, SE = 0.19), towards the feeding areas were significantly larger than those travelling north (mean = 1.75, SE = 0.03). The sex of 134 individuals in 63 complete pods was determined by molecular analysis of skin biopsies. Male humpback whales were found in larger pods than females. The most common pod type observed was the male-female pair, which is suggestive of either mating on migration and/or mate-guarding. Males were found associated together frequently. Competitive behaviour was observed during both the northward and southward migrations. The sexing of all individuals within 8 competitive pods indicated that not all contained a female. Although competitive behaviour was observed during the migration, most male-male associations were characterised by non-agonistic and occasionally cooperative interactions. We suggest there is a behavioural continuum on migration between the feeding and breeding grounds which is not governed solely by spatial proximity to the terminus. The pod characteristics of humpback whales on their return migration to the feeding grounds showed greatest similarity to those observed on breeding grounds elsewhere. In conclusion, our study showed that the migration of humpback whales is more than just a swim, and that the social influences on this species' migratory behaviour are subtle and complex. Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 181-192 ESCAPE BEHAVIOUR OF JUVENILE PSAMMODROMUS ALGIRUS LIZARDS: CONSTRAINT OF OR COMPENSATION FOR LIMITATIONS IN BODY SIZE? JOSE MARTIN and PILAR LOPEZ Departamento de Ecologia Evolutiva, Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales, CSIC, Jose Gutierrez Abascal 2, 28006 Madrid, Spain We compared the escape behaviour of juvenile and adult Psammodromus algirus lizards, by using data of escape performance in the laboratory and field observations of escape behaviour. We specifically examined whether a differential escape response is a constraint of body size, or whether juveniles behave differently in order to maximize their escape possibilities taking into account their size-related speed limitations. In the laboratory, juvenile lizards were slower than adult lizards, and escaped during less time and to shorter distances, even when removing the effect of body size. In the field, juveniles allowed closer approaches and after a short flight usually did not hide immediately, but did so after successive short runs if the attack persists. Approach distance of juveniles was not affected by habitat, but initial and total flight distances were shorter in covered microhabitats. There was no significant effect of environmental temperature on approach and initial flight distances of juveniles. However, the total flight distances were significantly correlated with air temperatures.</page><page sequence="350">992 VOLUME 132 Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 193-212 STABILITY OF SOCIAL STATUS IN WILD RATS: AGE AND THE ROLE OF SETTLED DOMINANCE MANUEL BERDOY and DAVID W. MACDONALD Wildlife Conservation Research Unit, Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford OXI 3PS, England, UK PETE SMITH Central Science Laboratory, MAFF, Tangley Place, Worplesdon, Guildford, Surrey GU3 3LQ, England, UK One way of understanding the evolution of social dominance is to establish which factors determine an animal's ability to dominate conspecifics. The dynamics of dominance between 20 adult male wild rats were investigated in a multi-generational, free-breeding colony in a large outdoor enclosure. Dominance relations between the adult males were stable and organised in a near-linear hierarchy. Dyadic interactions not fitting the social hierarchy, as well as challenges by subordinates and over aggression by dominants were rare (&lt; 5%) and principally occurred between animals of similar social rank. The correlates of social status within the colony show, for the first time in adult small mammals, that despite the significant role of body weight on the probability of winning contests, age was the most reliable indicator of adult dominance, with the higher ranking males being older but not necessarily heavier. Age also explained the outcome of 85% of agonistic encounters between dyads, compared with 65% for weights. The proximate mechanisms of age-related dominance fit better the 'previous outcome' hypothesis than the alternative 'fighting skill' or 'site dominance' hypotheses. The stability of dominance relations and the role of age, which in stable groups is equivalent with time spent in the colony, suggest that rats remain dominant over individuals that they have beaten in the past, long after initial body weight asymmetries have disappeared. The functional significance of the acceptance of subordinate social status is consistent with the fact that dominant individuals generally could not monopolize food resources or mates. Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 213-218 MANY MATES MAKE MALE PIPEFISH CHOOSY ANDERS BERGLUND Dept. of Zoology, Uppsala University, Villav. 9, S-752 36 Uppsala, Sweden In the sex-role reversed pipefish Syngnathus typhle males search for mates, and prefer to mate with large rather than small females. When mate density was experimentally manipulated, males exerted a mate choice only under high mate density, whereas no mate choice could be demonstrated under low mate density. Hence, when mates are infrequently encountered, males reduce the costs associated with an extended mate search by accepting females that otherwise would have been rejected. Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 219-236 TOOL-SET FOR TERMITE-FISHING BY CHIMPANZEES IN THE NDOKI FOREST, CONGO SHIGERU SUZUKI, SUEHISA KURODA and TOMOAKI NISHIHARA Department of Zoology, Faculty of Science, Kyoto University, Sakyo, Kyoto, Japan 606 Observations strongly indicate chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) of the Ndoki forest use two types of tools, 'perforating sticks' and 'fishing probes' in combination for termite (Macrotermes muelleri) fishing. Perforating sticks were always made of small, stout branches or young saplings of Thomandersia laurifolia (Acanthaceae), about 10 mm in diameter, with lengths of about 50 cm. Fishing probes were made from the flexible stems of Marantaceae species, and were about five mm in diameter, with lengths of about 50 cm. Approximately 15 cm of one end of the tool was usually shaped into a brush. It is likely that chimpanzees make small holes in the termite mound wall to attain access into the termite nest inside, then they insert the probe into the holes and eat the major and minor soldier termites which bite the brush-like end. Of 214 chimpanzee feces collected, 50% contained termite remains of this species, and this fecal analysis shows that termite-eating behavior occurred all the year around, and did not correspond to the seasonality of rainfall or termite activity on the ground. Chimpanzees in the Ndoki forest seem to be able</page><page sequence="351">VOLUME 132 993 to obtain termites from the deep subterranean nest throughout the year by using their tool-set. Such a tool-set might be responsible for the higher frequency of termite-eating in Ndoki chimpanzees than those of chimpanzees in other sites who fish for termites using only probes. This newly described behavior shows that chimpanzees habitually manipulate a tool on an object which they previously modified with another type of tool. Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 237-254 INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN EGG CANNIBALISM IN FEMALE DARK CHUB (PISCES: CYPRINIDAE) OSAMU KATANO and KOJI MAEKAWA National Research Institute of Fisheries Science, 1088 Komaki, Ueda, Nagano 386, Japan Nine of 41 identifiable females of dark chub, Zacco temmincki, in a river cannibalized eggs of other females. There was no significant difference in body size, condition factor or the location of home range between cannibals and noncannibals. In laboratory experiments, one male and two females were introduced into an aquarium to observe the behaviour of individual females while a pair spawned. The response of 16 females to spawning was observed and 15 of 16 females exhibited egg cannibalism. The percentages of egg-eating behaviour for individual females varied from 11.1 to 81.8%, and did not change significantly over the course of the experiment. Dark chub were multiple spawners. In a river the number of spawning sequences for cannibals was significantly higher than that for noncannibals. The number of eggs laid by cannibals was estimated to be 1.55 times as many as that by noncannibals. Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 255-300 WANDERERS BETWEEN HAREMS AND BACHELOR BANDS: MALE HANUMAN LANGURS (PRESBYTIS ENTELLUS) AT JODHPUR IN RAJASTHAN LAL SINGH RAJPUROHIT Department of Zoology, University of Jodhpur, Jodhpur 342001, Rajasthan, India; Institut fur Anthropologie der Georg-August-Universitat, 37073 Gottingen, Germany VOLKER SOMMER Institut fur Anthropologie der Georg-August-Universitat, 37073 Gottingen, Germany S.M. MOHNOT Department of Zoology, University of Jodhpur, Jodhpur 342001, Rajasthan, India 1. Life-histories of individually identified males of an Asian colobine monkey, the Hanuman langur, were followed in order to understand mechanisms and functions of social processes associated with the formation of male bands, especially the degree of cooperation and competition among males. 2. The monkeys belonged to a geographically isolated population which is subject of a field-study in Rajasthan, India, spanning more that 15 years. The population consists of 27-29 one-male/multi-female troops ('harems'; average 39 members, home ranges up to 1.3 kmi2) and 12-14 all-male bands (average 12 members, moving ranges up to 20 km2). Females are highly philopatric, whereas males transfer from bisexual troops into male bands. Harem holder residencies average 27 months (range 3 days to more than 74 months). No male achieved residency in more than one troop, suggesting that residency is associated with a distinct peak in a given male's resource holding potential. The proportion of infants sired by extra-troop males is minimal. The dispersal pattern of langur males seem to reflect a long-lasting effort to achieve reproduction. This goal is tied to the necessity to rise through the ranks of a male band to the top of its dominance hierarchy, because only the highest ranking males can replace current harem holders during male band invasions into the home range of bisexual troops. 3. The age-class composition of seven male bands with a mean membership of 3-25 individuals was studied in detail. The longitudinal fluctuation in membership was less pronounced than the differences between bands. This reflects ecological conditions in the moving range of a given band which determine a ceiling in the number of members. The bands contained 27% juveniles, 23% subadults, 13% young adults, 30% prime adults and 9% old males. At any given time, in each band lived at least one individual who was of at least young adult age. Immatures often followed elder males during daily travels, but not vice versa. Younger males obviously benefit from the presence of older, more experienced bachelors, who know about the dangers and resources in an unfamiliar terrain. However, the formation of bands is</page><page sequence="352">994 VOLUME 132 also associated with increased food competition. But, older males tolerate younger because they likewise benefit from their presence through e.g. the dilution effect in case of attacks by predators and harem holders. Moreover, high ranking males might have a greater chance to gain a harem residency when surrounded by many companions who function as buffers in agonistic interactions with other bands and harem holders. 4. Data on 157 demographic changes in male bands are presented. With regard to immigrants, 42% of the males transferred from their natal troop, 35% came from another male band, 5% joined after a solitary period, and 19% were ousted harem residents. For emigrations, the following number were found: 6% of the males transferred back into their natal troop, 36% transferred into another male band, 33% gained residency as a harem holder, and 24% died. 5. Male life histories are extremely variable. The whereabouts of males were tracked for up to 12 years. Most die before they reach adulthood, either in their natal troop or somewhere in its vicinity after they transfer into a band. Males who leave their natal troop are on average 2.5 years old (range 1.2 - about 6.6 years). Thereafter, most of them live succesively in several bands. Others do not change their band within a decade. Some males die in their prime adult or old age without having gained a harem residency. Those which become harem holders and are finally ousted may live solitarily, join their former or still another male band. Some males die soon once they are ousted, others live for years thereafter. 6. Demographic data on 58 females revealed that those who survive until adulthood will likely spent several decades in their natal troop until they die. But, because male mortality is high and male transfer frequent, it is not likely that a male will be a long-lasting member of the social unit he joins. For instance, two-thirds of all individuals changed residency in a given band, when they were still juveniles. Juvenile transfers can be related to the motivation to live with males of similar age. Similarly, only 30-50% of adult, young adult and subadult males were still members of the same band after two years. They probably try to increase their chance to gain a harem residency by taking the risk of frequent transfers. Old males were the least mobile. These individuals-usually ousted harem holders-aggregated in the relatively richest male band habitat. This, together with the fact that they tended to stay relatively long in the same band, reflects that they were at the end of their reproductive career. 7. Males may emigrate alone or with a cohort of paternal siblings, with or without their father. Maturing males emigrating from the same troop during successive years may join different bands. Because mortality is high and transfer frequent, it is unlikely that (half-)brothers survive together until maturity. The influence of kin-selection in structuring coalitions within bands seems thus to be rather low. This is probably one important reason for the fact that multi-male troops are extremely rare in the Jodhpur population. Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 301-318 RESPONSE OF MALE EUROPEAN STARLINGS TO EXPERIMENTAL REMOVAL OF THEIR MATE DURING DIFFERENT STAGES OF THE BREEDING CYCLE RIANNE PINXTEN, MARCEL EENS and RUDOLF FRANS VERHEYEN Department of Biology, University of Antwerp, U.I.A., Universiteitsplein 1, B-2610 Wilrijk, Belgium We experimentally removed females from monogamous European startling Sturnus vulgaris pairs during different stages of the breeding cycle and recorded the effect of these removals on male behaviour and on offspring survival in order to assess the possibilities for female mate desertion. Removal of the female during the laying, incubation and early nestling stage (1- to 5-day-old nestlings) invariably resulted in complete failure of the brood. The survival of the nestlings improved slightly if the female was removed during the middle nestling stage (6- to 10-day-old nestlings), but mortality rate of nestlings was still significantly higher than in control two-parent broods. About 80% of the males widowed during the laying/incubation period removed all eggs from the nest, while only 49% of all males widowed during the early and middle nestling stage removed all dead nestlings. Removal of eggs/dead nestlings by a widowed male startling probably functions to increase the chance on a successful re-mating, since replacement clutches were found only in nests whereof the clutch/brood was removed. We recorded one definite and at least nine suspected cases of parental infanticide, the killing of own offspring, by experimentally widowed male starlings. After nestlings reached 10 days of age (late nestling stage), there was no longer a significant difference in nestling mortality rate between male-only and two-parent broods. This crucial point coincides with the time when (1) the nestlings are functionally homeothermic, and (2) the exponential growth of the nestlings begins to moderate. Moreover, at this time, late in the season, the only viable option for deserted males is to care for the young because the probability of renesting successfully is low. Our results thus indicate that after nestlings reach 10 days of age, female starlings may have the opportunity to desert their mate. However, at that time, the benefits of female mate desertion are reduced as opportunities for renesting succesfully are low.</page><page sequence="353">VOLUME 132 995 Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 319-350 ATTACHMENT AND SOCIAL WITHDRAWAL IN AUTISM: HYPOTHESES AND FINDINGS J.K. BUITELAAR Department of Child Psychiatry, University of Utrecht, P.O. Box 85500, 3508 GA Utrecht, the Netherlands Autism is characterized by an impaired development in social interaction and communication and a markedly restricted repertoire of activities and interests. This paper summarizes the research into the social abnormalities in autism, and reviews the empirical support for two behavioural hypotheses on autism, i.e. that autism results from impaired attachment, or from intense and prolonged approach-avoidance conflicts. The core social impairment of autistic subjects seems to be a deficit in attunement and timing of actions and reactions rather than a difference in frequencies of behaviours. Attachment behaviour of most, if not all autistic children tends to be disorganized; nevertheless, they do form attachment relationships in terms of preferential proximity seeking or reunion behaviour in the Strange Situation Test. Attachment studies performed sofar however have methodological limitations; particularly the study of maternal- infant attunement and reciprocity has been neglected. Empirical evidence fails to support the presence of approach-avoidance conflicts in autistic subjects, and is further at variance with the predicted consequences of such conflicts. Insufficient attention has hitherto been paid to the clinical heterogeneity of autism in behavioural studies. A promising approach to deepen our understanding of the development of the autistic symptomatology is the early detection and subsequent behavioural study of 1-2 years old children at high- risk for autism. Finally, behaviour observation studies in autistic subjects are likely to benefit from the concurrent assessment of physiological indices of arousal, and from the integrated measurement of social-cognitive processes.

Two experimental strategies were developed in order: (i) to analyse the responsiveness of lambs to odours extracted from the prenatal environment (experiments 1 and 4) and to odours their were never exposed to (experiment 2), and (ii) to analyse the neonatal consequences of a prenatal exposure to a novel odorant (experiment 3). In experiment 1, when simultaneously presented with amniotic fluid (AF) and distilled water in a double- choice test, lambs displayed a clear attraction to AF. In experiment 3, two groups of lambs received differing exposure to citral in utero: group 1 lambs were born to ewes fed a citral diet and group 2 lambs were born to ewes never exposed to citral (CI). They were assessed in a double-choice test contrasting CI and AF (experiment 2 indicates that CI was neither attractive nor aversive in naive lambs). Although control lambs showed a clear preference for AF over CI, those exposed to CI prenatally did not orient discriminately to either stimulus, suggesting that prenatal experience with CI may alter postnatal respon- siveness to it. Experiment 4 tested the ability of lambs to discriminate between the chemosensory qualities of samples of own vs alien AF; lambs oriented preferentially to their own AF. These findings suggest that prenatal chemosensory experience may be stored by lambs for some time after birth and influence their search behaviour.</page><page sequence="354">996 VOLUME 132 Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 367-380 ABSENCE OF 'YOUNGEST ASCENDANCY' IN THE DOMINANCE RELATIONS OF SISTERS IN WILD JAPANESE MACAQUES (MACACA FUSCATA YAKUI) DAVID A.

Although the frequency of aggression was much lower than that reported for provisioned groups, and support in agonistic interactions was rare, a clear linear dominance hierarchy was apparent. In each of the four pairs of sisters in the troop the older was dominant to the younger. This is contrary to the pattern commonly reported for provisioned groups of Japanese and rhesus macaques, in which dominance among sexually mature sisters tends to be inversely correlated with age. For each pair of sisters in the study troop the mother was alive and healthy when the younger daughter became sexually active, but no cases were seen of a mother aiding one daughter against another. We therefore conclude a) that the absence of youngest ascendancy was due to a lack of support, rather than a lack of potential allies, and b) that both frequent agonistic support and youngest ascendancy are most likely to occur under conditions where concentrated food resources result in frequent and intense aggression. Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 381-400 INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN VOCALISATIONS OF YOUNG BARBARY MACAQUES (MACACA SYLVANUS): A MULTI-PARAMETRIC ANALYSIS TO IDENTIFY CRITICAL CUES IN ACOUSTIC SIGNALLING KURT HAMMERSCHMIDT and DIETMAR TODT Institut fur Verhaltensbiologie, Freie Universitat Berlin, Haderslebener Strasse 9, D-12163 Berlin, Germany It had been shown that Barbary macaque (Macaca sylvanus) mothers are able to individually recognise their offspring by its vocal signals, but it remained unclear which acoustical cues may account for such an ability. In order to address this issue from a basic perspective, about 1800 calls of infants and yearlings (N = 10) were investigated. The investigation applied a method of signal analysis which allowed to determine a large number of parameters (N = 84) for each vocal signal. The application of discriminant and cluster analyses provided the following results: (1) Animals differed in almost all call parameters. However, individuals were best identified by specific parameters which formed an individually characteristic parameter set. (2) Those parameters that facilitated the assignment of vocal patterns to a given individual usually were different among individuals. (3) Infants and yearlings achieved the same maximum value of correct assignment. However, infants achieved a reasonable assignment at a much smaller number of call parameters. (4) Cluster analysis of vocalisations revealed that Barbary macaques uttered individual versions of common call types. (5) When the discriminant analysis was rerun on the call clusters, the correct assignment could be improved from 81% to 91% for infants and from 80.5% to 96% for yearlings. Our findings suggest that Barbary macaque mothers can recognise their offspring by more than one signal cue, and such a strategy may improve the recognition system's robustness against possible distortions caused by the environment. The pronounced differences in vocal patterns of young Barbary macaques may help mothers or other group members to readily learn and recognise the individually specific signal features. The methodological procedures described in this paper provide a powerful tool for an assessment of signal parameters also in other areas of vocal interactions.</page><page sequence="355">VOLUME 132 997 Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 401-418 SOCIAL COMMUNICATION IN THE MADAGASCAR HISSING COCKROACH: FEATURES OF MALE COURTSHIP HISSES AND A COMPARISON OF COURTSHIP AND AGONISTIC HISSES DEBORAH C. CLARK and ALLEN J. MOORE Department of Entomology, Center for Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky 40546-0091, U.S.A. Male Madagascar hissing cockroaches (Gromphadorhina portentosa) produce acoustic sounds or 'hisses' during courtship interactions with females. G. portentosa males also hiss during agonistic interactions with other males. In this study we documented intra- and inter-individual variation in male courtship hisses, addressed the possible role of hissing as an indicator of male rank, size or mating success, and determined if individual males produce different hisses during courtship and agonistic interactions. We found inter-individual variation in courtship hisses in dominant frequency and duration. Within males, these characteristics of the courtship hiss were repeatable within a day. Characteristics of courtship hisses and mating success were not related to male rank. However, courtship hisses may convey information about the size of the male: larger males had longer, lower frequency hisses than smaller males. There was a trend for males that mated to be larger than males that did not mate. However, characteristics of the courtship hiss were not significantly related to mating success after controlling for differences in male weight. Finally, we found that the dominant frequency and duration of courtship and agonistic hisses of males did not differ suggesting that males are using similar signals during both courtship and agonistic interactions. We interpret these results in light of the possible functions of hissing, male-mail competition, and female discrimination during courtship interactions. Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 419-430 PLAY SIGNALS AS PUNCTUATION: THE STRUCTURE OF SOCIAL PLAY IN CANIDS MARC BEKOFF Department of Environmental, Population, and Organismic Biology, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado 80309-0334 U.S.A. Actions called play signals have evolved in many species in which social play has been observed. Despite there being only few empirical demonstrations, it generally is accepted that play signals are important in the initiation ("I want to play") and maintenance ("I still want to play") of ongoing social play. In this study I consider whether a specific and highly stereotyped signal, the bow, is used to maintain social play in adult and infant domestic dogs, infant wolves, and infant coyotes. To answer this question the temporal placement of bows relative to actions that are also used in other contexts (dominance or predatory encounters) such as biting accompanied by rapid side-to-side shaking of the head was analyzed to determine if bows performed during ongoing social play are used to communicate the message "I want to play despite what I am going to do or just did - I still want to play". The non- random occurrence of bows supports the hypothesis that bows are used to maintain social play in these canids when actions borrowed from other context, especially biting accompanied by rapid side-to-side shaking of the head, are likely to be misinterpreted.

In several species of nonhuman primates screams given by victims of attack elicit interventions from allies in the social group. In the present study, the screams of 16 pigtail macaques (M. nemestrina) under three years of age were assessed with respect to production and contextual usage. Data obtained from these</page><page sequence="356">998 VOLUME 132 animals three years later were compared with those from the previous period for evidence of changes in usage and production. It was hypothesized that these monkeys (8 males and 8 females), when three years older, would show patterns of contextual usage and production for agonistic screams that were more similar to those of adult animals. For control and comparison, 10 monkeys (9 females and 1 male) who had been older than three years of age during the earlier study were also sampled during the subsequent period. Calls of all subjects were assigned to one of four agonistic contexts (defined by the severity of the aggression and the dominance rank of the opponent) using discriminant functions that had been generated from the earlier data. While the successful classification rate improved for the 16 subjects that were originally three years of age or younger, no significant change was found for screams of the 10 older control monkeys. The probabilities with which screams of the 16 younger subjects were assigned correctly to context (a measure of call production) also were significantly higher during the second period. No such change was evident in the calls of the 10 control subjects. Data from the earlier study period had suggested that, among juveniles, females appeared to be more proficient than males in both the production and usage of these calls. During the second period of study, the proportion of calls that was classified correctly increased significantly for both males and females. The results of tests comparing the proportion of correctly classified calls for individuals revealed no differences between males and females during the second period, confirming similar results for pooled data analyses. Furthermore, there were no significant differences between males and females in the assignment probabilities with which calls were correctly classified. These results suggest that, with age, the younger monkeys became more proficient in the contextual usage and production of screams. Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 451-477 INDUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT OF A FILIAL PREDISPOSITION IN THE CHICK NEIL G. HAMPTON, JOHAN J. BOLHUIS and GABRIEL HORN Department of Zoology, University of Cambridge, Downing Street, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England Filial preferences in young domestic chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus, are influenced by at least two systems: one involved in learning about stimuli to which the animals are exposed, and the other a predisposition to approach stimuli resembling conspecifics. The predisposition is manifest in dark-reared chicks as an emerging preference for a rotating, stuffed jungle fowl over a rotating red box. In previous studies, 24 h-old visually naive chicks were placed in running wheels for 2 h. Throughout this time the chicks were in darkness. A significant preference for the stuffed fowl was found 24 h, but not 2 h later. In the present study it was shown that the predisposition becomes manifest at 10 h (Experiment la) and 5 h (Experiment lb) after either placement in running wheels, or after the chicks had been trained by exposure to a rotating red box. In Experiment 2 it was shown that placement in running wheels was not necessary for the predisposition to emerge. However, handling the birds was sufficient for the induction of a significant preference, expressed 5 h later. Exposure to a maternal call for 2 h (Experiment 3) was also sufficient to induce the development of the visual predisposition 24 h later. These results show that a visual predisposition to approach certain stimuli becomes manifest in dark-reared chicks between 2 and 5 h after the experience of handling, and that exposure to a maternal call is also sufficient to induce this predisposition. Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp.479-496 REVERSED SEXUAL SIZE DIMORPHISM AND PARENTAL CARE: MINIMAL DIVISION OF LABOUR IN THE BLUE-FOOTED BOOBY MARIA GUERRA and HUGH DRUMMOND Centro de Ecologia, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, A.P. 70-275, 04510 D.F., Mexico Reversed sexual size dimorphism in avian species (females larger than males) may be an adaptive con- sequence of different roles of males and females in parental care. We examined the alleged division of labour in two-chick broods of the blue-footed booby, using behavioural observation and frequent weigh- ing of chicks. In the first week of parental care, males and females fed broods at similar frequencies and provided similar masses of food, but females brooded more than males when broods were 5-10 d old. Subsequently, females provided a greater mass of food and frequency of feeds than males until chicks were at least 35 d old (mass) and 60 d old (frequency), while attending the brood for just as much time as males until chicks were at least 35 d old. Males and females did not differ in the tendency to feed (frequency and mass) the first-hatched chick differentially. In nearly all components of parental care ex-</page><page sequence="357">VOLUME 132 999 amined here, and in other studies, the female's contribution is equal to or greater than the male's. Only in clutch attendance and nest defence does the male contribute more than the female, but his small size seems unlikely to enhance performance in these activities. Overall, small size appears potentially to limit male provisioning of the brood, and is unlikely to be an adaptation for division of labour in parental care. This result casts doubt on the relevance of the division-of-labour hypothesis for adult size dimorphism. Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 497-518 SHORT DURATION TIME CONSTANT ASSOCIATED WITH CHEWING IN THE GUINEA PIG GEOFFREY E. GERSTNER Neuroethologic Systems Science Laboratory, University of Michigan School of Dentistry, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-1078, U.S.A. LOUIS J. GOLDBERG 325 Squire Hall, State University of New York, Buffalo, NY 14214, U.S.A. Previous investigations have reported a time constant on the order of a few seconds associated with temporal perception in humans, and with movement patterns in humans and other mammalian species. It has been suggested that the time constant represents the operation of a physiological oscillatory mechanism that is common among many mammalian species. However, the time constant has not yet been observed in laboratory animals; therefore, there is no laboratory-based behavior paradigm upon which studies into the physiological nature of this time constant can be based. Because of our familiarity with guinea pig feeding, the current study was undertaken in order to find evidence of the time constant in feeding- associated activities of guinea pigs. Eleven guinea pigs were starved for a 24 hr period, then placed individually into a rich behavioral arena for 30 min, during which time they were videotaped continuously while they roamed freely. The animals inevitably ate during these videotape sessions, and a detailed analysis of chewing parameters was done. It was found that chewing typically occurs in bursts, and that the median burst duration was 1.03-3.46 s for individual animals. Chewing burst durations were similar to the durations of many movement patterns in other species including humans. This provides further support for the hypothesis that there is a highly conserved time constant associated with movement patterns in mammals. It is believed that guinea pig chewing bursts provide a convenient laboratory based model for elucidating the neurophysiologic mechanisms of this time constant. Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 519-528 PARENT-OFFSPRING FEEDING RELATIONSHIP OF COOTS (FULICA ATRA) IN A VARYING ENVIRONMENT JUAN A. AMAT Estaci6n Biol6gica de Dofiana, C.S.I.C., Apartado 1056, E-41080 Sevilla, Spain Predictions derived from parental investment theory indicate that when the reproductive value of offspring decreases, parental investment should also decrease. If so, it should be expected that in adverse years, parental investment should be lower, given the lower survival prospects of chicks, than in more favourable years. I tested this by recording the frequency with which coots (Fulica atra) fed their chicks during a ten years period in a set of lakes that experienced considerable interannual variations in water levels. Contrary to the prediction, I found that during drier years, chicks were fed more frequently than during wetter years, in which self-feeding by chicks was more frequent. The reason for this could be that for coots the crucial factor for improving reproductive success is the quality rather than the quantity of chicks, and by increasing parental effort during more adverse years, the lower survival prospects of chicks could be attenuated. However, late in the breeding season, when fledging success is lower, chicks were fed by their parents less frequently than in the early breeding season. This could be related to a change in the cost/benefit ratio, itself independent of offspring quality, that parents experience when rearing chicks late in the season due to the start of plumage moult.</page><page sequence="358">1000 VOLUME 132 Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 529-558 MATING STRATEGY AND REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS IN THE TEIID LIZARD, AMEIVA PLEI ELLEN J. CENSKY Section of Amphibians and Reptiles, Carnegie Museum of Natural History, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213, U.S.A. and Department of Biological Sciences, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15260, U.S.A. Current selection on sexual size dimorphism was studied in a widely foraging non-territorial lizard, Ameiva plei. Males were significantly larger than females. Large males won intrasexual agonistic encounters and guarded females during their entire receptive period (1-4 days). Guarding males spent significantly less time foraging than males who were alone. Only males that guarded females were observed to mate. Mating success was highly skewed with only six of 21 mature males in the study site observed mating. All six males who mated were &gt; 141 mm SVL (males mature at 62 mm SVL). The four largest males obtained 84% of all observed matings and were estimated to have fertilized 88% of the eggs. Sexual selection appears to favor large size in males due to competition among males to guard females. Large females on Anguilla also had higher reproductive success because SVL was positively correlated with clutch size and number of clutches in a season. It appears that natural selection has favored different trade-offs between growth and reproduction in males and females. Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 559-569 PREDATOR VIGILANCE COSTS OF ALLOGROOMING IN WILD BLUE MONKEYS MARINA CORDS Anthropology Department, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, U.S.A. Although allogrooming in Catarrhine primates is often interpreted as if it were a costly behavior for the groomer, such costs have been convincingly documented. This paper presents data on rates of vigilance for aerial predators, measured as looking up toward the sky, in wild blue monkeys engaged in allogrooming, and compares these vigilance rates to those occurring when the same individuals engaged in other activities, namely feeding and resting. Grooming individuals have much lower vigilance rates than resting or feeding individuals, suggesting that grooming individuals are more likely to be at risk of being preyed upon. These results are not caused by a systematic relationship in the sample between activity and either foliage density or time of day, two factors potentially related to levels of safety from predation. Nor was there evidence that blue monkeys avoid the vigilance costs of grooming by engaging in this behavior primarily at safe times or in safe locations. Although the data suggest that vigilance costs occur, they may accrue to the recipient of grooming as well as the groomer, and may be compensated for both partners by long- or short-term benefits. Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 571-590 SEQUENTIAL ASSESSMENT AND DECISION-MAKING IN HUMANS MATTHEW S. SULLIVAN, DAWN BURNHAM, BARRY STEVENS-WOOD and BEN C. SHELDON Behavioural and Environmental Biology, Department of Biological Sciences, The Manchester Metropolitan University, Manchester NI 5GD, U.K. In two experiments inspired by theories of sequential information-gathering tasks such as sequential mate assessment, human subjects were asked to view sequences of pictures of mythical birds, each of which varied in value according to one of three stimuli, namely tail length, band width or intensity of black and carried an associated score. The subjects chose one picture from the sequence so as to maximise their points scored. Only one picture could be seen at a time, if a picture was rejected it could not be revisited and there was a small constant devaluation of each successive picture. In the first experiment two random sequences of each of the three stimuli were viewed and subjects were given no prior information on the population of pictures, nor was the devaluation specified. In the second experiment, which used only pictures which varied in tail length, subjects each saw a different random sequence and then the same fixed sequence. In addition, they were told there was either a 5%, 10% or 20% devaluation of successive</page><page sequence="359">VOLUME 132 birds, and half the subjects were given prior information on the population to be viewed. Thus in this experiment scores could be corrected for position in the sequence. To summarise the major results: 1. Choice was made at an early stage in the sequence, usually the 3rd, 4th or 5th picture, and this was consistent in both experiments. 2. In Experiment 2, subjects given prior information or smaller devaluation functions chose later in the sequence. 3. In Experiment 2 there were no differences in the corrected scores achieved by subjects in our treat- ments of prior information or devaluation, but subjects achieved higher absolute scores as the devaluation decreased. 4. In both experiments the value of the chosen picture was positively correlated with the mean value of the prior sequence seen when absolute scores are used, but in Experiment 2 this effect disappears when corrected scores are used. Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 591-606 HOW DO HENS VIEW OTHER HENS? THE USE OF LATERAL AND BINOCULAR VISUAL FIELDS IN SOCIAL RECOGNITION MARIAN STAMP DAWKINS Department of Zoology, South Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3PS, U.K. When shown familiar and unfamiliar birds at different distances, hens viewed birds 0.7 m or 1.4 m away with modal head angles between 54° and 72° from the midline, using the lateral visual field but viewed birds closer (less than 20 cm) binocularly, with the head within 18° either side of the midline (Expt. 1). When faced with a choice between a familiar and an unfamiliar bird at different distances, hens chose the familiar bird if the choice could be made 8 cm away but their choices were random if they had to chose 66 or 124 cm away (Expt. 2). This suggests that hens may be unable to discriminate familiar from unfamiliar birds except when they are very close to them. Observations of freely moving birds suddenly confronted with another hen (Expt. 3) showed that even when the object bird was familiar, it was in all cases initially scrutinized from a close distance (26 cm or less), which is consistent with the hypothesis that hens are unable to recognize other birds except when close enough to view them with the myopic lower frontal field. Reasons for this constraint on social recognition are discussed. Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 607-626 MORE IS NOT ALWAYS BElTER: MALE INCUBATION IN TWO ACROCEPHALUS WARBLERS SONIA KLEINDORFER, BIRGIT FESSL and HERBERT HOI Konrad Lorenz Institute for Comparative Ethology, SavoyenstraBe la, A-1160 Vienna, Austria This study investigates male and female incubation ability in two monogamous Acrocephalus warblers with overlapping, equally sized territories and similar prey abundance. Given the longer breeding time window of the moustached warbler (A. melanopogon) compared with the reed warbler (A. scirpaceus), the trade-off between the need for biparental care and the cost of inefficient incubation is discussed. Hourly protocols and egg temperature measurements were analyzed with regard to four primary questions: male and female incubation ability, the role of environmental parameters, hatching success and the influence of male incubation on female time allocation. In both species, males increase egg temperature per minute at a slower rate than do females. There is no species difference in the percentage of incubation per hour for males (20%) or females (50%). Ambient temperature influences male incubation only in the moustached warbler during the early season (April) when male incubation correlates with hatching success. The male reed warbler shows daily temporal selectivity throughout the breeding season, increased incubation during rainfall, and no correlation with hatching success. In both species, females receive direct benefits of increased foraging time through male incubation. However, only the female reed warbler adjusts her incubation duration to previous male incubation. Thus, female reed warblers maximise the male component and thereby reduce the total incubation phase with high male effort whereas the incubation phase is increased with above average male effort in the moustached warbler. 1001</page><page sequence="360">1002 VOLUME 132 Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 627-640 THE EFFECT OF HUNGER ON THE LEARNING OF NEW FOOD PREFERENCES IN THE MONGOLIAN GERBIL BJORN FORKMAN Department of Zoology, Stockholm University, S-106 91 Stockholm, Sweden A new and more profitable food type was introduced to three groups of Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus). When first presented with the new food one group was sated, another was hungry and the third group was hungry and expected a food shortage. In addition to the new food all groups had access to familiar food during the experimental sessions. The group that expected a food shortage had a lower intake of new food than either of the other groups, both in absolute and relative numbers. Both the sated and the hungry group ate the same absolute amount of new food during the first presentation, but since the sated animals had a lower total intake, the new food represented a higher proportion of the intake for these animals. The animals were then tested during the subsequent days (all groups now hungry). The group that had been sated showed a stronger preference for the new and profitable food than the hungry group, which in turn showed a stronger preference than the expected food shortage group. This means that in a semi-natural situation a strong need may actually decrease the rate of learning. The results can be explained in terms of risk prone/risk aversive behaviour along the lines of previous studies of risk sensitivity in optimal foraging. In an additional experiment it was shown that sated individuals will decrease their total intake of food when presented with both new and familiar food, in comparison with when only familiar food is present. This may have the effect of enhancing learning about the new food. Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 643-664 HOW LIKELY IS MALE MATE CHOICE AMONG ANURANS? JAMES J. KRUPA Department of Zoology, University of Oklahoma, Norman, Oklahoma 73019 Male mate choice has received considerable attention in recent years. This phenomenon rarely has been demonstrated in anuran mating systems, nonetheless, male choice has been suggested as having a significant impact on some anuran pairing patterns. Here I present a quantitative model that predicts the potential and prevalence of male mate choice in nine anuran species with data available in the literature. Males of only four of the nine species (Bufo americanus, B. bufo, B. exsul, and Rana sylvatica) are predicted to reject females under Normal conditions; in those cases only the smallest 1% to 5% of the females, respectively, should be rejected. By contrast, male Bufo conorus, B. cognatus, Hyla rosenbergi, Physalaemus pustulosus, and Rana catesbeiana are not expected to reject females of any size. Not until operational sex ratios became lm:if and search times were reduced to 30%, on average, of normal values will reject and accept strategies become equally prevalent. Thus for these nine anuran species, the quantitative model presented here elucidates why the extent of male mate choice may be very limited, and why it is not expected to exert a strong influence on mating dynamics or pairing patterns. Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 665-674 THE ROLE OF EXPERIENCE IN THE RESPONSE OF FATHEAD MINNOWS (PIMEPHALES PROMELAS) TO SKIN EXTRACT OF IOWA DARTERS (ETHEOSTOMA EXILE) DOUGLAS P. CHIVERS, BRIAN D. WISENDEN and R. JAN F. SMITH Department of Biology, 112 Science Place, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada, S7N 5E2 Detection of an alarm pheromone may allow conspecifics to lower their risk of predation if they avoid areas where alarm pheromones are detected. Similarly, individuals that learn to recognize and avoid alarm signals produced by heterospecifics of their prey guild (i.e. those with which they share common predators) will likely receive similar benefits. In two separate field studies we tested whether fathead minnows (Pimephales prormelas) avoid areas labelled with Iowa darter (Etheostoma exile) skin extract (which contains an alarm pheromone). One population of minnows tested was sympatric with darters while the other was allopatric from darters. Swordtails (Xiphophorus helleri) are allopatric from fathead minnows in both of the populations tested. Swordtail skin lacks ostariophysan and darter alarm pheromones, and</page><page sequence="361">VOLUME 132 1003 was used to control for a general response to damaged skin of an unfamiliar fish. In the darter-sympatric population we captured significantly fewer and smaller minnows in traps marked with darter skin extract (experimental traps) than traps marked with a control of swordtail skin extract. Given the correlation between age and size, and therefore experience, these data suggest that less experienced fish do not avoid darter skin extract to the same extent as do older more experienced fish. In the darter-allopatric population there was no difference in the number of minnows or the size of minnows captured in control versus experimental traps. Taken together, these results demonstrate that fathead minnows recognize and avoid areas where darter alarm pheromone is detected and that this is a learned response. Use of heterospecific alarm pheromones to assess predation risk may be a widespread phenomenon within communities of small fishes.

MORTON Department of Zoological Research, National Zoological Park, Washington, D.C. 2008 U.S.A.; e-mail: NZPEM034@SIVM.SI.EDU Extra-pair mating systems are now considered to be typical of songbirds because DNA fingerprinting has revealed high rates of extra-pair fertilizations (EPFs) in so many species previously thought to be monogamous. However, there is no general framework to explain the tremendous variability among songbirds in EPF rate. Here, in a comparison of EPF rates and temporal patterns of nesting among songbirds, we show that EPFs are most common in species where females breed synchronously. We argue that for both males and females, a temporal concentration of female fertility (breeding synchrony) increases the net benefits of seeking EPFs. One implication of this finding is that tropical songbirds, most of which breed asynchronously, are predicted to have low levels of extra-pair matings. Testes size is positively correlated with frequency of EPFs, and as predicted, tropical songbirds had small testes size relative to temperate zone species. The few DNA fingerprinting studies that exist for socially monogamous tropical songbirds support the correlation between breeding synchrony and EPFs. We believe that breeding synchrony is the most important factor promoting the evolution of extra-pair mating systems. Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 691-708 MATE SWITCHING AND COPULATION BEHAVIOUR IN THE ADELIE PENGUIN F.M. HUNTER Department of Zoology, Downing Street, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 3EJ, U.K. G.D. MILLER Department of Biology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131, U.S.A. L.S. DAVIS Department of Zoology, University of Otago, P.O. Box 56, Dunedin, New Zealand In monogamous species of birds sperm competition may result from either extra-pair copulations or mate switching. Copulation behaviour in individuals involved in extra-pair activity is well documented while little attention has been paid to mate switching. The aim of this study was to examine copulation behaviour in the Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae), a species in which females copulate sequentially with more than one male. 14.9% of females switched mates during the pre-laying period; all of these females engaged in successful copulations with both initial and final males. An estimated 9.8% of females engaged in successful EPCs over the same time period. Females that switched mates had on average 8 successful copulations with their initial partner while females that engaged in extra-pair copulation attempts had on average only 0.5 successful copulations with their extra-pair partner. These same females had on average 17 pair copulations per clutch. So in both cases females had significantly more copulations with their final, pair male than their initial partner or extra-pair partner. Frequencies of copulation that are higher than necessary for fertilisation are consistent with mechanisms of both last male sperm precedence and</page><page sequence="362">1004 VOLUME 132 proportional representation. However there is no support for last male sperm precedence from either diurnal or seasonal patterns of copulation relative to fertilisation. It appears that a high frequency of copulation may have evolved in pair males to protect paternity against initial males in this species.

Two-choice phonotaxis experiments were used to investigate female responses to shortterm variation in call timing in the African painted reed frog, Hyperolius marmoratus. The number of calls produced per stimulus in each choice test were equalised over either 10 or 20 seconds. 2. All alternative stimuli were tested against a regular stimulus with an invariant inter-call interval (ICI duration between the onset of successive calls). There were three categories of alternative call timing; bouts of rapid calling (short ICI) where the period of silence between bouts was shorter than the bouts of calling; bouts of rapid calling where the period of silence between bouts was longer than the bout of calling; and irregular calling (variable ICI) without prolonged periods of silence. 3. The only stimuli females discriminated against were rapid bouts of calling with prolonged periods of silence. Females showed significant differences in the number of responses when presented with two stimuli that differed in call timing over as short a period as 10 seconds. 4. We also calculated variability in the ICI of 25 males in the field. There was a significant negative relationship between mean call rate (calls/min) and variability in the ICI. Faster callers showed lower variability in ICI. 5. The phonotaxis experiments did not show a female preference for regular versus irregular call timing. So female mate choice of males with higher call rates in the field is not due to a preference for males with less variability in ICI.

JENNIONS A.B.R.G., Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford, OXI 3PS, U.K. 1. In two-choice phonotaxis experiments female painted reed frogs (Hyperolius marmoratus) preferentially chose the stimulus with the greater sound pressure level (SPL) at source when all other call parameters were identical. 2. However, this preference was not apparent when we increased the distance of the louder stimulus from the female such that the SPL of the two stimuli at the release point was equivalent. This suggests that females simply move up sound gradients ('passive attraction'). 3. Female choice of the loudest stimulus was also affected by the number of speakers. 4. There were significantly fewer responses to the loudest speaker in some four-choice compared to matched two-choice. phonotaxis experiments.</page><page sequence="363">VOLUME 132 1005 5.

Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 733-754 MATERNAL CONDITION AND THE QUALITY OF MATERNAL CARE IN VERVET MONKEYS L.A. FAIRBANKS Department of Psychiatry &amp; Biobehavioral Sciences, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, U.S.A. M.T. MCGUIRE Department of Psychiatry &amp; Biobehavioral Sciences, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, U.S.A.; Department of Psychiatry, Sepulveda Veterans Administration Medical Center, Sepulveda, CA, U.S.A. Seemingly contradictory results on the relationship between maternal condition and the quality of maternal care can be resolved by the hypothesis that maternal rejection is a U-shaped function of maternal condition. Data from 160 vervet monkey (Cercopithecus aethiops sabaeus) mother-infant dyads living in captive social groups were used to evaluate the influence of maternal reproductive condition on mother-infant contact, maternal rejection and infant mortality. Reproductive condition was defined as Marginal, Prime and Average based on age, weight, and dominance rank. Marginal mothers were at the extremes of the reproductive age distribution (3 years old or over 14) or were below a critical body weight (3.9 kg), characteristics that are associated with low rates of fertility in the study population. Prime mothers were in the top third of the female dominance hierarchy and of prime age (5-13), characteristics associated with higher than average fertility. Both marginal mothers and prime mothers had similar high rates of maternal rejection and low rates of ventral contact and proximity with their infants. Compared to mothers in the two extreme groups, mothers in average reproductive condition were significantly less rejecting and played a larger role in maintaining contact with their infants. Rates of maternal rejection, mother-infant contact, responsibility for contact, and the percentage time that infants spent on nonmaternal caretakers were all significantly related to maternal condition in U-shaped or inverted U-shaped functions. The infant mortality due to maternal abandonment or neglect was highest in the marginal group and was related to low body weight of the mother. We conclude that mothers in marginal condition limited maternal care to restore their own health, often at the expense of infant mortality, whereas mothers in prime condition used rejection to shorten the interval to the next conception, without suffering higher rates of infant mortality than average mothers.

DUNBAR Department of Anthropology, University College London, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England Advertisements from 'Lonely Hearts' columns in four US newspapers are used to test hypotheses about mate preferences by male and female humans. We first confirm conventional findings that, in general, men prefer young women whose reproductive value is high while women prefer men who are slightly older than themselves, that women seek resources while men seek physical attractiveness and that women are more choosy than men. We then go on to test a series of predictions derived from the hypothesis that an individual's preferences in these respects are likely to be contingent on what he/she has to offer. We show that women tend to become less demanding as they age (probably because reproductive value declines with age), whereas males become more demanding (probably because resources increase with age), that women (but not men) offering cues of physical attractiveness make higher demands than those that do not, that men (but not women) offering resources make higher demands than those that do not, that men with few resources to offer attempt to offset this disadvantage by offering cues of family commitment, that men and women with dependent offspring make lower demands than those without and that individuals from higher socio-economic groups (who are likely to have more resources to offer) make more demands than those from lower socio-economic groups.</page><page sequence="364">1006 VOLUME 132 Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 781-800 SPLITTING BEHAVIOUR INTO BOUTS; A MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD APPROACH S.D. LANGTON Central Science Laboratory, Tangley Place, Worplesdon, Surrey, GU3 3LQ, U.K. D. COLLETT Department of Applied Statistics, University of Reading, Reading, RG6 2FN, U.K. R.M. SIBLY Department of Pure and Applied Zoology, University of Reading, Reading, RG6 2AJ, U.K. One method of splitting behaviour into bouts is to model the data as a mixture of two (or more) exponential distributions and to calculate a bout criterion from the resulting parameter estimates. The parameter estimates under a mixture model can be obtained using a maximum of likelihood approach. The sample size required to obtain reasonable estimates of the parameters using this approach is investigated using simulated data, and found to depend on the ratio between the two densities of the two exponential processes and the proportion in which they are mixed. The use of likelihood ratio tests in helping to determine whether the data occur in bouts is also described and illustrated. Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 801-810 LATERALISATION OF INFANT HOLDING IN CHIMPANZEES: NEW DATA DO NOT CONFIRM PREVIOUS FINDINGS HERMAN DIENSKE, BRIAN HOPKINS and AARON K. REID Faculty of Human Movement Sciences, Free University, Amsterdam, The Netherlands About 80% of human females cradle their infants on the left side of the body. MANNING &amp; CHAMBERLAIN (1990) found a similar left-side bias for chimpanzees and two other ape species. In the present paper, however, only a slight bias was found which was-in contrast-right-sided. The combined results of the two studies do not differ from an homogeneous distribution between 0 and 100% right-sided. When data for 3 ape species and 3 studies are pooled, a significant bias is also absent. Even if a left-side bias were present in apes, comparability with humans is limited. The possible functions of a left-side bias in humans (better hearing of the mother's soothing heartbeat and better visual contact with the left side of the mother's face) might not apply to chimpanzees. For there are relevant behaviour differences between chimpanzees and humans. These concern different ways of holding and carrying, rare crying by ape infants, and rare facial orientation in apes. Moreover, most of the ape infants involved were older than the age at which the human bias is found. For the time being, no convincing evidence for a bias in apes exists.

BILENCA and FERNANDO 0. KRAVETZ Departamento de Ciencias Biol6gicas, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Universidad de Buenos Aires. Ciudad Universitaria, Pabellon II, 4to Piso (1428), Buenos Aires, Argentina We studied the social interactions between Akodon azarae and Calomys laucha, and between A. azarae and Oligoryzomys flavescens, by means of experimental confrontations under laboratory conditions. Trials were carried out after two treatments: in the first one ('food' treatment), the animals were offered food ad libitum permanently, whereas in the other ('fast' treatment), the animals were previously submitted to fasting for 30 hours. The largest species-A. azarae-dominated the other two species, being dominant in 69.6% of the aggressive interactions in which a clear dominant/subordinate relationship was detected (N = 79). During the 'fast' treatment, A. azarae fed longer than C. laucha and 0. flavescens, and it was the only species which significantly increased its feeding time with respect to 'food' treatment. There were higher frequencies of aggressive interactions in A. azarae-C. laucha trials than in A. azarae- 0. flavescens trials. Comparisons of the behavioural variables between C. Iaucha and 0. flavescens during their respective confrontations with A. azarae showed that C. laucha had significantly higher median</page><page sequence="365">VOLUME 132 1007 values of freezing and walking behaviours, whereas 0. flavescens showed a higher frequency of alertness. Species differences found in the laboratory support the interpretation that A. azarae is usually dominant over C. laucha and 0. flavescens, and that A. azarae has the priority of access to food sources in situations of food shortage (winter) by means of its social dominance over the other two species. We suggest that the differences in the behavioural reactions of the subordinate species when meeting the dominant one may help to explain the different scales of spatial segregation that C. laucha and 0. flavescens maintain with A. azarae in the field. Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 821-836 MALE COURTSHIP DISPLAYS, ORNAMENTS AND FEMALE MATE CHOICE IN CAPTIVE RED JUNGLE FOWL MARLENE ZUK, STACEY L. PORMA and TORGEIR S. JOHNSEN Department of Biology, University of California, Riverside CA 92521 USA We studied the role of male courtship behaviour in female mate choice in red jungle fowl (Gallus gallus), the ancestor of domestic chickens. The traits most highly correlated with behavioural displays were those most relied upon by females in making mate choice decisions. These traits (comb length, comb colour, eye colour, and spur length) are highly condition-dependent in jungle fowl. Females chose males that displayed at a greater overall intensity in the period after the female was allowed to interact with the males (post-release), but were indifferent to displays during the period before the female could approach the roosters (pre-release). After accounting for the effect of morphology on mate choice, waltzes were the only display that explained a significant amount of variation in male mating success. Chosen and rejected males had different display rates even when the female was not present. Plasma testosterone level was correlated with pre-release behaviours, but not with post-release behaviours or mating success. Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 837-859 CAN YOUNG CHIMPANZEES (PAN TROGLODYTES) IMITATE ARBITRARY ACTIONS? HAYES &amp; HAYES (1952) REVISITED DEBORAH M. CUSTANCE and ANDREW WHITEN Scottish Primate Research Group, School of Psychology, St. Andrews University, St. Andrews, Fife KY16 9JU, Scotland KIM A. BARD Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, U.S.A. Contrary to recent scepticism, systematic use of an experimental approach suggested by HAYES &amp; HAYES (1952) shows that chimpanzees can imitate novel actions. Two chimpanzees imitated 13 and 17 novel arbitrary gestures, respectively. They were first taught to reproduce 15 gestures on the command, "Do this!", and then presented with 48 novel items. Using a rigourous coding system, two independent observers correctly identified a significant number of the chimpanzees' imitations (p &amp;lt; 0.0001). We conclude that after a period of tuition chimpanzees can go on to imitate arbitrary actions, providing evidence of a basic cognitive capacity for perspective-taking and cross-modal matching. Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 861-874 SEX-ROLE REVERSAL IN THE BLACK-CHINNED TILAPIA, SAROTHERODON MELANOTHERON (RUPPEL) (CICHLIDAE) SIGAL BALSHINE-EARN Large Animal Research Group, Department of Zoology, University of Cambridge, Downing Street, Cambridge, CB2 3EJ, U.K. BRENDAN J. McANDREW Institute of Aquaculture, University of Stirling, Stirling, FK9 4LA, Scotland, U.K. In the animal kingdom most species follow standard sex roles: males compete more intensely for mates and females exert greater mate choice. Recent theory suggests that the direction of sexual selection is the outcome of sexual differences in potential reproductive rates (PRRs): the sex with the higher PRR</page><page sequence="366">1008 VOLUME 132 will compete for mates and the sex with the lower PRR will be most selective. This study tests the theory experimentally by examining competition for mates and mate choice in the black-chinned tilapia, Sarotherodon melanotheron, paternal mouth brooding cichlid. In this species, the PRR of males is lower than that of females. In laboratory competition trials, females were more aggressive: they bit, chased and initiated mouth fights more often than males. Dominant females were also much better at monopolising potential mates compared to dominant males. A second experiment confirmed that males were choosy for size, preferring large partners over small ones, while females did not discriminate for size. Therefore, the prediction of sex role reversal (competitive females and discriminating males) is confirmed. Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 875-901 USE OF TRILL VOCALIZATIONS TO COORDINATE TROOP MOVEMENT AMONG WHITE-FACED CAPUCHINS: A SECOND FIELD TEST SUE BOINSKI Department of Anthropology and Division of Comparative Medicine, 1350 Turlington, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611, U.S.A. and Laboratory of Comparative Ethology, NICHD, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, U.S.A. AIMEE F. CAMPBELL Department of Anthropology, Washington University, St. Louis, MO 63130, U.S.A. The white-faced capuchin, Cebus capucinus, employed a specialized vocalization, the trill, to coordinate troop movement at La Selva, an Atlantic wet-forest study site in Costa Rica. We analyse the contexts in which this intra-group vocalization was emitted, including responses elicited from other group members. A cumulative 26.6 hours of continuous samples and 3,314 spectrograms (including 1,295 trills) were analysed from a study troop with 16 focal subjects. These results generally corroborate the conclusions of a comparable field study of white-faced capuchins at Santa Rosa, a Pacific coast dry-forest site in Costa Rica (BOINSKI, 1993, Amer. J. Primatol. 30, p. 85-100). At both sites, (1) trills were closely associated with the initiation of movement by a stationary troop in a specific direction. (2) Trills were emitted at a much higher rate in the leading edge of a travelling troop than in following positions. (3) Individuals often reinforced the efforts of other troop members to coordinate troop movement. (4) Lack of consensus among troop members over the travel route was evident. (5) In rare instances trills were employed in tactical maneuvers suggestive of intentionally and the ability to anticipate behavioural effects. Differences in the usage of trills at these two sites were also detected. (1) At La Selva all troop members, with the exception of infants, used trills in the coordination of troop movement, whereas at Santa Rosa marked age, sex and rank distinctions in the extent of participation were apparent. (2) Capuchins at Santa Rosa altered the trajectory of travelling troops with trills, even reversing directions, but not at La Selva. These disparities may follow from differences between the sites in the extent of visual and auditory contact typical among troop members, social structure, susceptibility to predation, and possible genetic variation. Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 915-934 A REVIEW OF REPRODUCTIVE RATES IN STICKLEBACKS IN RELATION TO PARENTAL EXPENDITURE AND OPERATIONAL SEX RATIOS R.J. WOOTTON, D.A. FLETCHER, C. SMITH and F.G. WHORISKEY Institute of Biological Sciences, University of Wales, Aberystwyth, Dyfed SY23 3DA, Wales, U.K. 1. The expenditures of time and energy on parental activities of female and male three spine sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus L., are reviewed in the context of sex differences in competition for and choice of mates. 2. The female's parental contribution is mainly cytoplasmic in the form of provisioned eggs. In energy units each clutch spawned represents about 200% of the daily maintenance ration of a sexually mature female. Each egg in a clutch represents about 2% of that ration. The 'time out', during which the female is sexually unreceptive between spawnings, varies from about 3 to 15 days, and is inversely correlated with the rate of food consumption. 3. The male's parental contribution is primarily behavioural. The daily energy expenditure of a parental male is equivalent to a daily ration of about 6% of the male's body weight, a value not dissimilar to that of a reproductively active female The pattern of 'time-outs' of males differs from that of females, with the periods of sexual receptivity and unreceptivity both longer.</page><page sequence="367">VOLUME 132 1009 4. A crude simulation model of the effect of sex differences in the pattern and length of 'time outs' sug- gested that the operational sex ratio (OSR) would usually be male-biased favouring inter-male competition for mates and mate choice by females. 5. However, both environmental factors such as food availability, and demographic factors such as sex differences in mortality rates, together with the sex differences in 'time out' could cause the OSR to vary within breeding seasons, between breeding seasons and between populations. This leads to the prediction that there will be corresponding variations in the intensities of male-male and female-female competition for mates and hence in the development of secondary sexual characteristics. Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 935-950 MALE MATING PREFERENCE IN STICKLEBACKS: EFFECTS OF REPEATED TESTING AND OWN ATTRACTIVENESS THEO C.M. BAKKER Abt. Verhaltensokologie, Zoologisches Institut, University of Bern, Wohlenstrasse 50a, CH-3032 Hinterkappelen, Switzerland WILLIAM J. ROWLAND Department of Biology, Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana 47405, U.S.A. In sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, males have conspicuous nuptial coloration, whereas females are cryptically coloured. Usually females are the choosy sex in mate choice, but under certain conditions males may be choosy too. Females signal their spawning readiness, among others, by displaying a head-up courtship posture while pointing at the preferred male. We tested the male's preference for this posture by offering males a simultaneous choice of two stylized dummies of ripe females, one in head-up posture and one horizontal. The males directed relatively more courtship to the head-up dummy, and tended to do the more so the more intense the blue iris of their own eyes (corrected for differences in male length). Because the blue eye colour is a criterion of female choice in this population, attractive males tended to be choosier. Upon repeated presentation of the dummies to the same males on subsequent days, the males' preference for the head-up dummy disappeared, but there was no change in total courtship activity. When confronted with a different, more realistic pair of dummies, the same males showed again a preference for the head-up posture suggesting that male preference can be influenced by experience. Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 951-962 DO FEMALE STICKLEBACK CARE ABOUT MALE COURTSHIP VIGOUR? MANIPULATION OF DISPLAY TEMPO USING VIDEO PLAYBACK WILLIAM J. ROWLAND Department of Biology &amp; Center for the Integrative Study of Animal Behavior, Indiana University, Bloomington IN 47405 U.S.A. Reproductive 6' and y threespine stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus were presented with a videotaped sequence of a zigzag dancing 6' played back at normal (T), half (0.ST), one-and-a-half (1.ST), double (2T) and triple (3T) tempo. Playbacks were displayed pairwise (T/0.5T; T/1.5T; T/2T; T/3T) on monitors placed at opposite ends of the test tank. Each playback pair was displayed to subjects for 4 min, with display locations switched to opposite ends of the test tank at 2 min to control for position preference. Both a' and y subjects responded to playback images much like they do to live a'6', demonstrating the potential of video playback for analysing visual communication in stickleback. Male and 9 subjects contacted 1.5T and 2T images as much as images moving at normal tempo but they contacted 0.5T and 3T images less. Thus, subjects were more attracted to da' displaying at normal to slightly faster tempo than to do' displaying outside that range. The stabilizing selection that such effects might impose on animals could contribute to the typical intensity that characterizes much of their display behaviour.</page><page sequence="368">1010 VOLUME 132 Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 963-978 NUPTIAL COLOUR LOSS AND SIGNAL MASKING IN GASTEROSTEUS: AN ANALYSIS USING VIDEO IMAGING C.G. MCDONALD, T.E. REIMCHEN and C.W. HAWRYSHYN University of Victoria, Department of Biology, Victoria B.C., P.O. Box 1700, V8W 2Y2, Canada Threespine stickleback vary greatly in male nuptial display, from full red expression between the throat and pelvis to total melanism without any traces of red. The dominant expression for any population is correlated with the underwater spectral irradiance and many populations with melanistic nuptial colour occur in bog habitats where the aquatic spectrum is shifted to long wavelengths. Field observations indicate that in these bog habitats, the typical red nuptial signal is 'spectrally masked' and this might reduce the effectiveness of display during male-male and male-female interactions. We used video- imaging techniques to test whether the spectral composition of the visual background influences female preference for nuptial colouration in male threespine sticklebacks. Throat colour preference tests were carried out in which females chose between video-images of red and black-throated males superimposed on either a blue or a red background. Despite belonging to a red-throated population, females were found to respond preferentially to the black-throated male image viewed against a red background, indicating that preference was not determined by throat patch hue. This suggests that preference for an epigamic optical signal is likely a function of its efficacy in generating visual contrast rather than its intrinsic spectral characteristics. Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 979-996 THE MECHANISMS OF COLOUR-BASED MATE CHOICE IN FEMALE THREESPINE STICKLEBACKS: HUE, CONTRAST AND CONFIGURATIONAL CUES C.L. BAUBE, W.J. ROWLAND and J.B. FOWLER Indiana University, Program in Animal Behavior, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA We investigated the importance of male nuptial colouration as a cue for female mate choice in the threespine stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus L. In courtship preference tests, sexually receptive females were presented with pairs of dummies that differed in the hue, extent or distribution of colouration. Females preferred to court i) a red-bellied dummy over a green-bellied dummy, a uniformly tan dummy, and an all-red dummy and ii) a yellow-bellied dummy over a red-bellied dummy. Females showed no preferences when presented with i) an all-red and uniformly tan dummy and ii) two dummies that differed only in the location of red colouration (belly versus dorsum). In the three experiments in which females preferred a 25% red dummy, the proportion of courtship directed to this dummy increased with overall females responsiveness. The results of mathematical models of colour opponent and luminosity processing suggest that female preferences are influenced by a male's belly colour contrast and not by merely its brightness contrast. Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 997-1010 THE EFFECTS OF RIVAL MALE INTERACTION ON COURTSHIP AND PARENTAL CARE IN THE FOURSPINE STICKLEBACK, APELTES QUADRACUS HARLEIGH E. WILLMOTT and SUSAN A. FOSTER Department of Biological Sciences, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, Arkansas, 72701, USA and Department of Biology, Clark University, Worcester, MA 01610, USA Rival male interruptions in aggregate breeders are often responsible for prolonged courtship and reduced spawning success. This study was conducted to examine the effects of rival male interference on courtship and parental care in the relatively nonaggressive, vegetation-nesting fourspine stickleback, Apeltes quadra- cus. Specifically, the timing of seven sequential courtship behavior patterns was recorded and the intervals between them were calculated in both rival and solitary male situations. Time to first nest attention af- ter spawning, time from trial start to first nest approach by the female, and overall courtship length were also scored. Of the seven courtship intervals only one, that between the female's first push into the nest and Iher entry, took significantly longer in the presence of a rival male. Overall, courtship duration was only marginally longer in rival versus solitary situations. The effects of rival male interference were most pronounced in post-courtship nest attention. Males took longer to begin post-spawning nest repairs in</page><page sequence="369">VOLUME 132 1011 the presence of a rival male than when alone. In addition, limited nest attention is probably the cause of reduced hatching success in rival male tanks although reduced care due to uncertain paternity cannot be ruled out. The lack of difference in courtship duration between rival and solitary treatments is prob- ably due to two factors: (1) females were introduced in glass jars five minutes prior to trial start during which time they seemed to form a distinct preference for one male; (2) fourspine stickleback males use female mimicry to sneak over to neighbors' nests and rarely attempt to enter the nest until after the fe- male has spawned and left. Future research on sneaking in the fourspine stickleback should include DNA finger-printing of offspring to determine paternity in nests fertilized by both the owner and a sneaker(s). Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 101 1-1024 FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH AND FITNESS EFFECTS OF NEST-RAIDING IN THE THREE-SPINED STICKLEBACK, GASTEROSTEUS ACULEATUS, IN A NATURAL SITUATION SEIICHI MORI Center for Ecological Research, Kyoto University, Shimo-sakamoto, Otsu, 520-01 Japan The occurrence and consequences of nest-raiding behaviours of male three-spined sticklebacks (Gasteros- teus aculeatus L., forma leiura) were studied in an enclosed section of a small stream of the Tsuya River, Gifu Prefecture Central Japan. The observations were made almost daily on 99 males which were individ- ually marked and the 189 nests built by them during the breeding season, March to mid July 1988. About 10% of the nests were subjected to raiding which included egg cannibalism, egg stealing and sneaking fertilizations. Most raidings were done by single territorial males. The probability of nest raiding was re- lated to the degree of cover around the nest: nests in dense vegetation were most prone to raiders. The probability of raiding was further related to the stage of the nest: nests with eggs were most liable, those with fry least liable to raiding actions. Males that performed raiding behaviour could have nests in every stage, but most likely had no eggs in their nests. The probability of being raided was thus positively related to the number of neighbouring nests without eggs. Males that raided had a significantly duller overall nuptial coloration during the egg collecting phase than non-raiders. Body size and territory size did not differ between raiders and non-raiders. Raiders may thus be less attractive to ripe females. By egg stealing they may increase the attractiveness of their otherwise empty nest to spawning. Indeed, nests of raiders produced significantly more often young than those of non-raiders, but the number of young produced in successful nests was not different between the two categories of males. Nest-raiding was determined to the victims of raiding actions: raided nests produced less offspring early in the breeding season.

In breeding males the plasma levels of 1 1-ketotestosterone (1 IKT) are higher than those of other measured androgens, and display a clear peak in the breeding season. 11 KA can be converted extra-testicularity to 11KT. In breeding females the plasma levels of 1 KT are lower than in breeding males, whereas the opposite is the case for testosterone. Castration leads to the desappearence of male reproductive behaviour and secondary sexual characters. 11 -androgens are more effective than other androgens it stimulating secondary sexual characters, notably kidney hypertrophy. All aspects of male reproductive behaviour can be restored in castrated males with 1 KA capsules. 1 IKA was more effective than other tested androgens in this respect. The effectiveness of 1 IKA on nesting is not influenced by photoperiod.</page><page sequence="370">1012 VOLUME 132 Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 1037-1058 SIGNALLING, MATING SUCCESS AND PATERNAL INVESTMENT IN STICKLEBACKS (GASTEROSTEUSACULEATUS): A THEORETICAL MODEL NICOLAS PERRIN University of Bern, Zoologisches Institut, Abt. Verhaltensokologie, Wohlenstrasse 50a, CH-3032 Hinterkappelen, Switzerland I present an optimisation model that links paternal investment, male display and female choice. Although deviced for sticklebacks, it readily applies to other fish with male guarding behaviour. It relies on a few basic assumptions on the ways hatching success depends on paternal investment and clutch size, and male survival on paternal investment and signaling. Paternal investment is here a state-dependent decision, and signal a condition-dependent handicap by which males inform females of how much they are willing to invest. Series of predictions are derived on female and male breeding strategies, including optimal levels of signaling and paternal investment as functions of clutch size, own condition, and residual reproductive value, as well as alternative strategies such as egg kleptoparasitism. Some predictions already have empirical support, for which the present model provides new interpretations. Other might readily be tested, e.g. by simple clutch-size manipulations.

SCHMOETZER Center for Ecology, Evolution and Behavior, T.H. Morgan School of Biological Sciences, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, 40506-0225, USA We constructed a dynamic programming model to investigate the phenomena of brood cycling and filial cannibalism in fishes with paternal care. We assumed that parents behave so as to maximize their total expectation of hatching clutches during a breeding season plus a small probability of breeding in future seasons. We further assumed ecological tradeoffs among fitness components such that investment in one component of fitness results in a reduction in other fitness components. We found that the pattern of brood cycling was most strongly affected by mating costs to survival of the parent and survival of the eggs in the nest. Filial cannibalism was most strongly affected by feeding costs to parent and nest survival. Brood cycling appeared to be independent of feeding costs, and filial cannibalism appeared to be independent of mating costs.

Box 1700, Victoria, B.C., Canada This study investigates ecological aspects to intrapopulation variability in the lateral plates of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) at a coastal lake in western Canada. The frequency distribution of the plates, which was slightly skewed to the right and leptokurtic, varied spatially and seasonally. Cyclical frequency changes in plates were most pronounced on sub-adult size classes and these closely tracked (multiple r = 0.77) seasonal differences in the relative proportion of the two major predator groups, trout and diving birds. Trout predation was correlated with an increase in plate number while bird predation was correlated with a reduction in plate number. Such divergent selection pressures, which are probably common in natural populations, would account for the presence of multiple phenotypes and allow for rapid shifts in defensive morphology among different populations where predation regime differs.</page><page sequence="371">VOLUME 132 1013 Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 1095-1105 PELVIC GIRDLE POLYMORPHISM AND REPRODUCTIVE BARRIERS IN THE NINESPINE STICKLEBACK PUNGITIUS PUNGITIUS (L.)

In some areas in northern Karelia, these populations are reproductively isolated from parapatric populations of the 'wild type' with pelvic girdle, while in adjacent areas, populations are polymorphic and have intermediate girdle phenotypes. This seems to reflect the initial stage of divergence. Experiments in large ponds show a selective advantage of the loss of the pelvic girdle under pressure from insects predators and a selective disadvantage under predatory fish. Mate choice tests indicate reproductive isolation between pelvic phenotypes. Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 1107-1130 UNDERSTANDING THE EVOLUTION OF BEHAVIOR IN THREESPINE STICKLEBACK: THE VALUE OF GEOGRAPHIC VARIATION SUSAN A. FOSTER Department of Biological Sciences, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR 72701, U.S.A. The endemic radiation of the threespine stickleback in North America possesses features that will permit us to gain unique insights into evolutionary pattern and process. Already, comparison of populations has demonstrated a remarkable level of adaptive differentiation in reproductive behavior across populations in both southern British Columbia, Canada, and the Cook Inlet Region of Alaska, U.S.A. In small, shallow lakes, threespine stickleback feed predominantly on benthic invertebrates in the shallow littoral zone. They form large groups that attack nests defended by males, and consume all of the young within. In contrast, in larger, more oligotrophic lakes, adult stickleback feed primarily on plankton in large open-water foraging groups. They do not form groups that cannibalize young in nests. In these non-cannibalistic populations, males perform more conspicuous courtship behavior than do those in cannibalistic populations, apparently because risk of attack by visually hunting conspecifics is low. Courtship in these lakes more often includes the conspicuous zig-zag dance, and less often, meandering and dorsal pricking. Anadromous populations tend to be cannibalistic, but also are often behaviorally intermediate. They incorporate the zig-zag dance in courtship more often than do males in cannibalistic freshwater populations, but also usually incorporate the less conspicuous dorsal pricking behavior. These results suggest that the ancestral condition was intermediate and that both cannibalistic and non-cannibalistic freshwater populations display some derived elements in their reproductive repertoires. This kind of comparison among populations thought to have been independently derived from the marine form can provide insights into the patterns and causes of adaptive diversification. For populations such as these, carefully chosen from disparate geographic locations so as to preclude common evolutionary his- tory after colonization of freshwater, an unresolved polytomy is probably the best phylogenetic model. For closely-spaced lakes within drainages, branching trees, reflecting gene flow after colonization, are probably more realistic models. Resolution of such phylogeographic relationships requires the acquisition of appropriate molecular data. Both approaches, with their implicitely historical view of character evo- lution, provide windows that will permit us an unusually clear view of historical changes in behavioral phenotypes and of their causes.</page><page sequence="372">1014 VOLUME 132 Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 1131-1152 INTRASPECIFIC SYSTEMATICS OF GASTEROSTEUS ACULEATUS POPULATIONS: IMPLICATIONS FOR BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY MICHAEL A. BELL Department of Ecology and Evolution, State University of New York, Stony Brook, New York 11794-5245, USA The threespine stickleback is widespread in diverse coastal marine and freshwater habitats of the Holarc- tic. Extensive information on its behavior and evolution provide an exceptional background for behavioral ecology. The behavioral phenotype links studies of proximate and ultimate (evolutionary) causes of be- havior. Analyses of the ultimate causes of behavior should be placed in a phylogenetic context. There have been four phases of interpretation of phenotypic variation in threespine stickleback: (1) taxonomic, (2) dispersalist-neutralist, (3) adaptationist, and (4) adaptationist-phylogenetic. Gasterosteus aculeatus should be treated as a highly variable species complex. Phylogenetic inferences based on geographi- cal location and allozyme and nucleotide variation facilitate discrimination between ancestry and local adaptation as ultimate causes of phenotypic variation among populations. The phylogeny of threespine stickleback populations and the use of phylogenetic information to analyze causation of pelvic girdle variation among populations are reviewed. Criteria for selection of populations and behavioral traits for comparative studies are discussed. Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 1153-1172 LATERAL PLATE MORPH GENETICS REVISITED: EVIDENCE FOR A FOURTH MORPH IN THREE-SPINED STICKLEBACKS JERZY BANBURA Department of Ecology and Vertebrate Zoology, University of Lodi, Banacha 12/16, 90-237 Lodz, Poland THEO C.M. BAKKER Universitat Bern, Zoologisches Institut, Abt. Verhaltensokologie, CH-3032 Hinterkappelen, Wohlenstrasse 50a, Switzerland 1. The view that four (not three) lateral plate morphs exist in the three-spined stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus is supported in this paper. The morphs are: trachura (= completely plated), semiarmata (= partially plated), leiura (= low plated), and leiura-with-keel (= low-plated-with-keel). 2. Two one-locus and four two-locus models of lateral plate morph inheritance are identified and reviewed. A new genetic model for a two-locus system comprising one major gene with three alleles and one dominance modifier gene with two alleles is advocated. 3. Predictions of different models are explicitly examined using the existent data. 4. Results of 10 new crosses that distinguished the form leiura-with-keel are presented. The segregation ratios obtained are best explained by the new model. 5. Adaptive value of plate morph differentiation is not clear. Different aspects of selection on the morphs are discussed. Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 1173-1182 REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION AMONG LATERAL PLATE PHENOTYPES (LOW, PARTIAL, COMPLETE) OF THE THREESPINE STICKLEBACK, GASTEROSTEUS ACULEATUS, FROM THE WHITE SEA BASIN AND THE KAMCHATKA PENINSULA, RUSSIA VALERY V. ZIUGANOV Institute of Developmental Biology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Vavilov Str. 26, Moscow 117808, Russia Reproductive isolation was investigated among sympatric lateral plate morphs of threespine stickleback from the White Sea basin and also among phenotypically similar morphs from the distant Kamchatka River basin (Lake Azabachije). Female choice tests show that gene flow is restricted among the completely</page><page sequence="373">VOLUME 132 1015 plated and low plated morphs at both locations; behavioural isolation between these morphs is complete among Lake Azabachije fish, and nearly so (93% positive assortative mating) among White Sea basin fish. However, the experiments also demonstrate that there are no barriers to reproduction among the Azabachije and White Sea complete morphs, among the Azabachije low and White Sea complete morphs, nor among the Azabachije complete and White Sea low morphs. In addition, there is no evidence of barriers to gene flow among the low and partially plated morphs. Therefore, although gene flow is restricted among the extreme morphs within each locality, nevertheless gene exchange is possible, either directly or secondarily, among all phenotypes. The reproductive isolation between the complete and low morphs from the White Sea basin developed in situ no more than eight generations after the sticklebacks were introduced into an isolated freshwater pond. Therefore behavioural isolation can evolve very rapidly among the lateral plate phenotypes of Gasterosteus aculeatus.

BLOUW Department of Biology, St. Francis Xavier University, Antigonish, Nova Scotia, Canada B2G 2W5 Males of the newly discovered 'white' stickleback disperse their embryos over the filamentous algae in which they nest and, unlike any other stickleback, they provide no subsequent parental care. Previously known populations of white sticklebacks nest only in shallow subtidal waters where filamentous algae are abundant. Our purpose in this paper is to describe highly divergent populations at Spry Bay, Nova Scotia, Canada, in which males build nests on bare rock in the subtidal and intertidal zones, and disperse their embryos over bare rock. Intertidal embryos are exposed to air and are vulnerable to desiccation at low tide. Field studies reveal that nests are built from locally available materials directly on the rock substrate. They are constructed very quickly and tend to be less substantial than subtidal nests. Internest distances are shorter in the intertidal zone than in adjacent subtidal areas. Dispersed intertidal embryos tend to settle into crevices between stones where the microenvironment remains moist and temperate between tides due to the presence of organic detritus and shade. Such embryos survive, develop, and hatch. Similar behaviours occur at other sites in Nova Scotia, and we know that it has persisted for at least four years at Spry Bay. We conclude that breeding and dispersing embryos over bare rock substrate, and intertidal breeding, are novel but stable breeding repertoires. We hypothesize that they have evolved secondarily to the evolution of emancipation from parental care in the white stickleback. Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 1207-1222 EXPERIMENTS OF EMBRYO SURVIVORSHIP, HABITAT SELECTION, AND COMPETITIVE ABILITY OF A STICKLEBACK FISH (GASTEROSTEUS) WHICH NESTS IN THE ROCKY INTERTIDAL ZONE J.F. MACDONALD, S.M. MACISAAC, J. BEKKERS and D.M. BLOUW Department of Biology, St. Francis Xavier University, Antigonish, Nova Scotia, Canada B2G 2W5 Like other 'white' sticklebacks, those nesting intertidally at Spry Bay, Nova Scotia, Canada, remove fertilized eggs from the nest, disperse them over the surrounding area, and provide no subsequent parental care. However the breeding substrate at Spry Bay is devoid of the filamentous algae which are the normal breeding substrate of the white stickleback and which elsewhere facilitate survival of abandoned embryos. Experiments show that embryos dispersed in the intertidal zone at Spry Bay survive surprisingly well despite the complete absence of parental care and the periodic absence of water. Intertidal embryos generally develop faster than embryos in the adjacent subtidal zone, but there are exceptions to this pattern. Intertidal males show site fidelity to their nests despite interrupted access to territory, and they show consistent preference for nesting in the intertidal zone in the field. In the laboratory, and in the absence of tidal flux and competition, males taken from the rocky intertidal zone generally prefer to breed on bare rock substrate even when filamentous algae are freely available. When white stickleback males from an adjacent population which breeds subtidally in filamentous algae are introduced into the experimental aquaria as competitors, they exclude the males that breed on bare rock. The surprisingly high survivorship of embryos in the rocky intertidal zone, the habitat selection of males for bare substrate, and their exclusion by males that breed subtidally on algae, all suggest that the highly unusual breeding behaviours of intertidal white males form an effective alternative breeding repertoire. Because breeding</page><page sequence="374">1016 VOLUME 132 habitat selection has implications for mate selection, the possibility exists that sticklebacks with different breeding repertoires at Spry Bay may mate assortatively. Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 1223-1240 THE EFFECT OF SCHISTOCEPHALUS SOUDUS (CESTODA: PSEUDOPHYLLIDEA) ON THE FORAGING AND SHOALING BEHAVIOUR OF THREE-SPINED STICKLEBACKS, GASTEROSTEUS ACULEATUS IAIN BARBER and FELICITY A. HUNTINGFORD Fish Behaviour and Ecology Group, Division of Environmental and Evolutionary Biology, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Scotland, U.K. In this paper we review recent experimental work on the effects of the parasite Schistocephalus solidus (Cestoda: Pseudophyllidea) on the feeding behaviour of three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculea- tus L.). We also discuss how increased feeding motivation and subsequent altered foraging behaviour may be a mechanism for parasite-associated changes in the shoaling behaviour of infected sticklebacks. The presence of S. solidus plerocercoids in the body cavity constricts the stomach, increases the handling time for large prey and consequently reduces the profitability of such prey for infected fish. This is re- flected in a switch in dietary preference from large to small prey in the laboratory and in altered stomach contents and impaired nutrient reserves in the wild. By altering their hosts' nutritional state by direct competition for nutrients from digested food (and possibly indirectly by altering diet and reducing com- petitive ability) and also by altering the fishes' appearance, such parasites have the potential to alter the costs and benefits involved in joining a shoal of conspecifics. Experimental work on the shoaling de- cisions of S. solidus-infected sticklebacks supports this hypothesis, and such behavioural modification is discussed in the context of the manipulation hypothesis of parasite transmission. Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 1241-1254 FORAGING BEHAVIOUR AND MEMORY WINDOW IN STICKLEBACKS P.A. MACKNEY and R.N. HUGHES School of Biological Sciences, University of Wales, Bangor, Gwynedd, LL57 2UW Individuals were collected from a residential marine population of Spinachia spinachia, an anadromous population of Gasterosteus aculeatus forma trachura and a residential freshwater population of G. aculea- tus forma leiura. After maintenance for 2 months on a diet of mysid, individuals were subjected to ten, consecutive daily trials on a diet of amphipods or oligochaetes. During this period, individuals learned to handle the prey more effectively, as measured by attack efficiency, handling efficiency and handling time. Learning was similar among populations but differed between diets, being more pronounced for am- phipods, which are more difficult to catch and handle than oligochaetes. Once trained to these diets, fish were tested for foraging efficiency after successively longer periods of stimulus deprivation, when they were fed a maintenance diet of mysid. All three measures of foraging efficiency with the amphipod diet, but only that based on handling time with the oligochaete diet, declined to naive levels in the residential marine and anadromous populations. No decrease in foraging efficiency with either diet occurred in the residential freshwater population. Memory window was 8 d, 10 d and &gt; 25 d in the residential marine, anadromous and residential freshwater populations respectively. The large difference between the fresh- water and two marine populations is interpreted as an adaptive response to the stability of arrays of prey, characteristic of their respective habitats. Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 1255-1266 HABITUATION OF A PREDATORY RESPONSE IN THE STICKLEBACK (GASTEROSTEUS ACULEATUS) HARMAN V.S. PEEKE Brain Behavior Research Center, Department of Psychiatry, University of California, San Francisco, Sonoma Developmental Center, Eldridge, CA 95431, U.S.A., and Bodega Marine Laboratory, University of California, Davis, Bodega Bay, CA 94923, U.S.A. Sticklebacks presented with a clear glass tube filled with live brine shrimp will initially attempt to capture them; however, the response wanes within minutes. In the case of females, the rate of initial response is en-</page><page sequence="375">VOLUME 132 1017 hanced and the rate of waning is influenced by the state of the female (gravid females are more responsive) and by the density of the prey (greater density results in greater responsiveness). The predatory-response habituation differs from habituation of territorial aggression and courtship in that the pre-decremental, in- cremental process is absent. In common with habituation of territorial aggression but not with courtship, there is little short-term recovery of the response. The differences are consistent with different functional requirements for an experience-based inhibitory mechanism involved in the modulation of stickleback behaviour.

HUISMAN Van der Klaauw Laboratory, Institute for Ecological and Evolutionary Sciences, University of Leiden, Kaiserstraat 63, P.O. Box 9516, 2300 RA Leiden, The Netherlands Research was started into a possible circadian periodicity in the behaviour of the three-spined stickleback. The behaviour of solitary males in the sexual phase of their breeding cycle was studied under constant conditions, including illumination of constant brightness (LL). No, 'free-running', circadian rhythm was found. Both the frequency of nest-visits and the rate of creeping-through (which shows an ultradian periodicity) were remarkably constant over long periods. Also, operant conditions experiments, in which the male could switch the lights on or off, did not reveal any circadian fluctuation in the preference for light or dark. In the course of the long-term recordings 'rest-periods' were found, lasting some 10 to 50 minutes, in which the fish was surprisingly inactive, and did not visit the nest. Although some characteristics of these 'rest-periods' seem to point to a 'sleep-like' nature, others seem to argue against this. Behaviour Vol. 132 (1995) pp. 1285-1299 ROLE OF THE THREE-SPINED STICKLEBACK GASTEROSTEUS ACULEATUS L. IN THE FOOD ECOLOGY OF THE SPOONBILL PLATALEA LEUCORODIA JAN H. KEMPER Organization for the improvement of inland fisheries, P.O. Box 433, 3430 AK Nieuwegein, The Netherlands In a five year study (1985-1989), the importance of the three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus to the spoonbill, Platalea leucorodia was elucidated. Both species migrate from distant areas to meet in polder areas as prey and predator, in the Netherlands. In the spring, spoonbills fly all the way from Afrika and the south of Spain to breed in colonies. As long as juvenile spoonbills are not able to fly, the demand for food is high, and the supply from the foraging areas is of vital importance. The availability of food in the foraging areas around one of the major spoonbill colonies was studied. Different food situations (prey items, prey density) were judged by means of the average food intake rate. Food situations in which prey items weigh over 2 gram, turned out to be most favourable. Prey density was of less importance. Anadromous three-spined sticklebacks, migrate from the sea in the spring to breed in shallow ditches and back waters. Their body weight is about 2.5 gram which makes it an excellent prey for the spoonbill. Unfortunately, in the last decades, it has become very hard for the anadromous stickleback to migrate into polder areas. Modernisation of agriculture has led to a situation in which open connections between channels and polder area have disappeared. The presumed benefit of the anadromous stickleback for the spoonbill, was tested, by transporting 1,000 kilogram of anadromous sticklebacks to a polder area. The impact on the spoonbills was studied in a two year period. Since there was a distinct effect on the spoonbill, it was decided to design a fish ladder to enable anadromous sticklebacks to enter the polder again. The concept was tested in 1988. In 1989 a permanent construction was built.</page></plain_text>
