<plain_text><page sequence="1">HARVEY BROOKS Scientific Concepts and Cultural Change There are many difficulties of communication between the sub groups within our culture?for example, between the natural sci ences, social sciences, and humanities. But there are also ways in which they are becoming increasingly united, and most of this essay will be an effort to trace a few common themes and viewpoints derived from science which I see as increasingly pervading our culture as a whole. Perhaps one of the most important is the common allegiance of scholarship to the ideal of objective research, to the possibility of arriving by successive approximations at an objective description of reality. Whether it be concerned with the structure of a distant galaxy or the sources of the art of the nineteenth century poet, there exists a common respect for evidence and a willingness to follow evidence wherever it leads regardless of the preconceptions or de sires of the scholar. This is, of course, only an ideal; but failure to conform to this ideal, if detected, damns a scholar whether he be a scientist or a humanist. In a sense the whole apparatus of academic scholarship is an attempt to bring scientific method into the pursuit of knowledge through progressive refinements in the uncovering and use of evidence. A characteristic of scholarship, as of science, is that it prefers to tackle well-defined, finite problems that appear to be soluble with the methods and evidence available. This often means eschewing the more fundamental, the more "metaphysical" issues, in the belief that the cumulative result of solving many smaller and more man ageable problems will ultimately throw more light on the larger issues than would a frontal attack. One of the paradoxes of modern science has been that the greater its success in a pragmatic sense, the more modest its aims have tended to become in an intellectual sense. The goals and claims of modern quantum theory are far more modest than those of Laplace, who believed that he could predict 66</page><page sequence="2">Scientific Concepts and Cultural Change the entire course of the universe, in principle, given its initial con ditions. The aim of science has changed from the "explanation" of reality to the "description" of reality?description with the greatest logical and aesthetic economy. The claims to universality of nineteenth century physics have been replaced by a greater awareness of what still remains to be discovered about the world, even "in principle." The day of global theories of the social struc ture or of individual psychology seems to have passed. Experience has taught us that real insight has often been achieved only after we were prepared to renounce our claim that our theories were universal. The whole trend of modern scholarship has been towards greater conservatism in deciding what can be legitimately in ferred from given evidence; we are more hesitant to extrapolate beyond the immediate circumstances to which the evidence applies. We are quicker to recognize the possibility of unrevealed complexi ties or unidentified variables and parameters. Even in artistic criti cism we tend to recognize greater diversity in the influences playing on an artist, greater ambiguity in his motives or artistic intentions. Art, scholarship, and science are united in looking further behind the face of common-sense reality, in finding subtleties and nuances. It is, of course, this search for subtlety which has made communica tion between disciplines more difficult, because to the casual ob server each discipline appears to be working in an area beyond common sense. The admission of finite aims in scholarship has been connected with an increasingly sophisticated view of the scope and limitations of evidence in all fields. But the emphasis on finite and limited aims in scholarly inquiry has also been paralleled by the extension of scientific and scholarly attitudes to practical affairs. One sees a close analogy between the preoccupation of science with manage able problems and the decline of ideology and growth of profes sional expertise in politics and business. One of the most striking developments of the post-war world has been the increasing irrele vance of political ideology, even in the Soviet Union, to actual political decisions. One sees the influence of the new mood in the increasing bureaucratization and professionalization of government and industry and in the growth of "scientific" approaches to manage ment and administration. The day of the intuitive entrepreneur or the charismatic statesman, seems to be waning. In a recent vol ume of Dsedalus on "A New Europe?" the recurring theme is the increasing relegation of questions which used to be matters of 67</page><page sequence="3">HARVEY BROOKS political debate to professional cadres of technicians and experts which function almost independently of the democratic political process. In most of the western world the first instinct of statesman ship is to turn intransigent problems over to "experts" or to "study groups." There appears to be an almost naive faith that if big problems can be broken down sufficiently and be dealt with by experts and technicians, the big problems will tend to disappear or at least lose much of their urgency. Although the continuing discourse of experts seems wasteful, "Parkinsonian," the fact re mains that it has worked surprisingly well in government, just as it has in science and scholarship. The progress which is achieved, while slower, seems more solid, more irreversible, more capable of enlisting a wide consensus. Much of the history of social progress in the twentieth century can be described in terms of the transfer of wider and wider areas of public policy from politics to expertise. I do not believe it is too fanciful to draw a parallel between this and the scientific spirit of tackling soluble problems. The trend towards the acceptance of expertise has been espe cially striking in Europe where both ideology and the apolitical professional bureaucracy have been stronger than in the United States. But even in this country there has been increasing public acceptance of expert analysis and guidance in such areas of govern ment as fiscal policy and economic growth. In the realm of affairs, as in the realm of knowledge, the search for global solutions or global generalizations has been replaced by the search for man ageable apolitical reformulations of problems. The general has been replaced by the specific. Concern with the theoretical goals and principles of action has been replaced by attempts at objectively predicting and analyzing the specific consequences of specific al ternative actions or policies. Often the problems of political choice have become buried in debates among experts over highly technical alternatives. It remains to be seen to what degree this new reign of the bureaucrat and the expert reflects the influence of science and scientific modes of thinking and to what degree it represents a temporary cyclic phenomenon resulting from unprecedented eco nomic growth and the absence of major social crises. However, the modes of thought which are characteristic of science have pene trated much deeper into scholarship and practical affairs than the hand-wringing of some scientists would tend to suggest, and the general adoption of these modes of thought does not appear to have 68</page><page sequence="4">Scientific Concepts and Cultural Change relegated genuine human values to the scrap heap to the degree which some of the humanists would have us believe. Indeed it has brought us closer to a realization of many of the human values which we regard as desirable. On the other hand, it must be recognized, that some of this reliance on expertise has moved us in directions in which we would not have gone had we been more aware of the unspoken and un recognized assumptions underlying some of our "technical" solu tions. For example, economic growth and technology have come to be accepted as valuable in themselves. The assembly line has brought more and more goods to more and more people, but it has also introduced monotony into work and a sometimes depress ing standardization into our products. The technology of produc tion tends to accept as its goals values which technology alone is well adapted to achieving without balanced consideration of other, equally important goals.1 The very definition of gross national product connotes measurement of economic progress in purely quantitative terms without reference to changes in the quality of the social and physical environment or improvement and deteriora tion in the quality and variety of the products available. The in clination to tackle the soluble problems first often extrapolates to the view that the more intractable problems are less important. In the preceding paragraphs I have argued that both scholarship and practical affairs have increasingly adopted the spirit and mode of thought of the natural sciences. An interesting question is to what extent the actual concepts and ideas of science have entered into other disciplines and into our culture generally. There are, of course, some very obvious ways in which this has occurred. Scarcely any other scientific theory, for example, has influenced literature and art so much as Freud's psychoanalytical theory. Though some of Freud's ideas might be said to contain dogmatic elements which are essentially non-scientific or even anti-scientific in spirit, never theless, psychoanalysis is based on largely empirical observation and professes to test itself against objective evidence. It is clearly a scientific theory which, though extensively elaborated and modi fied, is still basically valid in its description of the irrational and subconscious elements in human motivation and behavior. It has completely altered our view of human nature, and this changed viewpoint is reflected almost universally, though in varying degrees, 69</page><page sequence="5">HARVEY BROOKS in modern literature and art, as well as in the interpretation of history and political behavior. The orderly Lockean world embodied in the American Constitution, in which each man acts rationally in his own self-interest, can no longer be accepted in quite the undi luted way that the Founding Fathers believed in it. There is ample evidence of neurotic and irrational behavior on the part of whole communities and social systems, often in opposition to their own self-interest. Even organized religion has largely accepted and adapted many of the principles of psychoanalysis, while rejecting some of the world views which have been extrapolated from it. A more problematic example is the parallel between the in creasingly abstract and insubstantial picture of the physical uni verse which modern physics has given us and the popularity of abstract and non-representational forms of art and poetry. In each case the representation of reality is increasingly removed from the picture which is immediately presented to us by our senses. As the appreciation of modern physics requires more and more prior education, so the appreciation of modern art and music requires a more educated?some would say a more thoroughly conditioned ?aesthetic taste. In physics the sharp distinction which used to be made between the object and its relations to other objects has been replaced by the idea that the object (or elementary particle) is nothing but the nexus of the various relations in which it par ticipates. In physics, as in art and literature, form has tended to achieve a status higher than substance. It is difficult to tell how much psychological reality there is to this parallel. It is not sufficient to reply that a physical picture is still a definite model which can be related by a series of clear and logical steps to the world which we see and that no such close correspondence exists between abstract art and the sensible world. For physical models depend to a larger degree on taste than is generally appreciated. While correspondence with the real world exists, this probably is not sufficient by itself to constitute a unique determinant of a model. Yet the successful model is one that has evolved through so many small steps that it would take a bold imagination indeed to construct another one which would fit the same accumulation of interconnected facts or observations. What is regarded as acceptable evidence for a model of reality, even in physics, is strongly dependent on the scientific environment of the time. Evidence which favors theories already generally accepted is much less critically scrutinized than evidence that appears to 70</page><page sequence="6">Scientific Concepts and Cultural Change run counter to them. One always makes every effort to fit new evidence to existing concepts before accepting radical modifications; if a theory is well established the contradictory evidence is usually questioned long before the theory, and usually rightly so. Estab lished theories depend on many more bits of accumulated evidence than is often appreciated, even by the scientist himself. Once a principle becomes generally accepted the scientific community generally forgets much of the detailed evidence that led to it, and it takes a real jolt to lead people to reconsider the evidence. In fact, scientific theories are seldom fully displaced; rather they are fitted into the framework of a more comprehensive theory, as New tonian mechanics was fitted into the formulations of relativity and quantum mechanics. This, in itself, suggests that there are many theories or models which will fit given facts. All of this points to the fact that a scientific theory is the prod uct of a long evolutionary process which is not strictly logical or even retraceable. The mode of presentation of science, especially to the non-scientist, usually suppresses or conceals the process by which the results were originally arrived at, just as the artist does not reveal the elements which went into his creation. Thus it seems possible that there is some common or universal element in the modern mentality which makes quantum theory acceptable to the physicist, abstract art to the artist, metaphysical poetry to the poet, atonal music to the musician, or abstract spaces to the mathema tician. The attack on these aspects of modern culture by totalitarians of both the right and the left perhaps lends further credence to these common threads. It is interesting to observe that children with previously untrained tastes have little trouble in appreciating and enjoying modern art or music and that the younger generation of physicists has no trouble in absorbing the ideas of quantum mechanics quite intuitively with none of the sense of paradox which still troubles some of the older generation. It is probable that the main elements of taste, whether it be scientific or aesthetic, are formed quite early in our experience and are strongly condi tioned by the cultural climate. Science, as one of the most dynamic of contemporary intellectual trends, is undoubtedly a strong factor in creating this cultural climate, but it would be rash to ascribe causal connections. It would be interesting to know whether some psychologist, by studying current tastes in art or poetry, could pre dict what kinds of theories were likely to be acceptable in ele mentary particle physics, or perhaps vice versal 71</page><page sequence="7">HARVEY BROOKS Another obvious but superficial way in which scientific ideas enter our culture is through some of the dominant "themes" of science. One such theme, for example, is evolution and natural selection, and the derived philosophical concept of progress. Today we take the idea of evolution so much for granted that we are inclined to forget that until the nineteenth century it was generally believed that the present state of society and man was the result of degeneration from some antecedent golden age or hypothetical ideal "state of nature." The Puritan Revolution in England and the French Revolution had ideologies which appealed to a hypo thetical prehistoric past for their model of an ideal society. Only with Marx did revolution present itself as a forward movement into a more "advanced," previously non-existent state of human society. In the nineteenth century the idea of evolution and particularly the concepts of natural selection, competition between species, and the "survival of the fittest" were seized upon as an explanation of and justification for the contemporary laissez-faire capitalist society. State intervention in the competitive economic process was re garded as an almost immoral interference with the "balance of nature" in human society. In the United States and Britain the first science of sociology was built upon an interpretation of the ideas of natural selection. A whole generation of future American busi nessmen was educated in the ideas of men like Sumner. This so ciology stressed the dangers of permitting organized society to tamper with the inexorable laws of social evolution. In the early part of the twentieth century Darwin's ideas lost some of their original influence, but now, in the second half, they have regained much of their influence in biology and have tended to be reinforced by recent discoveries in biochemi cal genetics. However, it is interesting to note that a subtle change of emphasis has crept into the interpretation of natural selection. The modern evolutionary biologist tends to stress the concept of the "ecological niche" and the fact that natural selection, when looked at more carefully, leads to a kind of cooperation among spe cies, a cooperation which results from finer and finer differentiation of function and of adaptation to the environment.2 Indeed, biologists stress the fact that natural selection generally leads not to the complete domination of one species, but rather to a finer and finer branching of species, a sort of division of labor which tends ulti mately to minimize competition. Is it too much to suggest a parallel here between the changing scientific interpretations of biological 72</page><page sequence="8">Scientific Concepts and Cultural Change evolution and changing attitudes towards cooperative action in human societies? Is there any connection between the modern view of ecology and the progressive division of labor and specialization of function which are characteristic of modern economic organiza tion? Certainly the analogies with biological evolution have been extremely suggestive in the development of modern cultural anthro pology. Another theme which is involved here is that of dynamic equilibrium or balance, also fruitful in the study of chemical equilib rium. When dynamic equilibrium exists, a complex system can be apparently static from the macroscopic viewpoint even though rapid changes are taking place in its elementary components. All that is necessary is that the rates of changes in opposite directions balance. This is the kind of equilibrium that is envisioned as oc curring in an ecological system or in a social or economic system. It would, perhaps, be wrong to suggest any causal or genetic rela tion between the growth of such ideas of chemical theory and their application to social or biological systems. The fact is, however, that the concepts arose at similar periods in scientific development and helped to establish a kind of climate of taste in scientific theories which undoubtedly facilitated intuitive transfer from one discipline to another. One finds the images and vocabulary of chemical equilibrium theory constantly recurring in descriptions of social and economic phenomena. Two of the germinal ideas of twentieth-century physics have been "relativity" and "uncertainty." Philosophers generally recognize that both of these themes have had an important influence on their attitudes, but the physical scientist finds it more difficult to connect the philosophical view with its role in physics. At least the connec tion is not so self-evident as it is in the case of evolution or of psychoanalysis. Indeed, both relativity and uncertainty are words which have rather precise operational meanings in physics, but which have been given all sorts of wishful or anthropomorphic interpretations in philosophy. Indeed, scientific popularizers have themselves been especially guilty of this type of questionable se mantic extrapolation.3 The situation has been aggravated by the tendency of physicists to use words from everyday discourse to denote very subtle and precise technical concepts. The popularizer and the layman then use the technical and the everyday term inter changeably to draw conclusions bearing little relation to the orig inal concept. 73</page><page sequence="9">HARVEY BROOKS Let us consider relativity first. The basic idea of relativity is that all the laws of mechanics and electromagnetism are the same, independent of the state of uniform motion in which the observer happens to be moving. Relativity is "relative" in the sense that there is no "absolute" motion, no fixed reference point in the uni verse that has greater claim to validity than any other. On the other hand, the elimination of absolute motion is achieved only at the price of introducing an absolute velocity which is the same in all reference systems, namely, the velocity of light. Thus it may be legitimately questioned whether "relativity" or "absolutism" is the correct name for the theory. Nevertheless, the first terminology was the one that caught the popular and speculative imagination and provided the basis of a revolution in viewpoint which affected many areas of knowledge. Not long after relativity was absorbed into physics, the anthropologists were stressing the extraordinary diversity of human customs and ethical norms and were arguing that moral standards had to be viewed not in an absolute sense but relative to the particular culture in which they were found. The judgments of history became less moralistic; the actions of in dividuals tended to be viewed in the context of the ethical norms of their time. The realistic novel or drama in which human be havior was depicted without moral judgment became fashionable. Yet if these things have little to do with "relativity" in the sense that Einstein intended, the very fact that the word caught fire so easily suggests there does exist a kind of common taste in such matters and that this taste forms part of the intellectual climate of the time. The other key idea of physics is "uncertainty," as embodied in the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The philosophical interpreta tion of this principle has been the subject of interminable debate by both scientists and laymen. On one extreme, people have viewed the uncertainty principle as repealing the laws of causality and reintroducing "free will" into the physical as well as the mental universe. Most working physicists tend to take a somewhat more pedestrian view of the principle. They interpret it as being the result of an attempt to describe the state of the universe in terms of an inappropriate and outmoded concept, namely that of the point mass or "particle," a concept derived by analogy with macro scopic, i.e. common sense, physics. Nevertheless, regardless of the exact interpretation, the uncertainty principle does imply that the idealized classical determinism of Laplace is impossible. The laws 74</page><page sequence="10">Scientific Concepts and Cultural Change of quantum theory are deterministic or "causal" in the sense that the state of the universe at any time is determined by its "state" at some previous time. The lack of determinism in the Laplacian sense comes from the impossibility of specifying the "state" at any time in terms of any set of operations which will not themselves change its state and thus spoil the assumptions. What is wrong in the old determinism is the idea that the universe can be uniquely and unequivocally distinguished from the observing system, which is a part of it. In this sense the uncertainty principle can be seen as merely a further extension of the concept of relativity.4 Inter preted in this light, we find the same idea cropping up in many fields of knowledge. The social scientist is increasingly conscious that the measurements that he can make on any social system affect the future behavior of the system. A good example is public opinion polls, which, if made public, affect the attitude of the public on the very matters the polls are supposed to measure "objectively." Another example is educational tests, which not only measure hu man ability, but tend to change the cultural and educational norms which are accepted and sought. This aspect of the uncertainty principle in the social sciences is, in quantitative terms, a matter of some debate, but it is an important factor in social measurement, which has to be dealt with just as in physics. In many social situa tions the mere fact that the subjects know they are being observed or tested affects their behavior in ways which are difficult to dis count in advance. Even in a subject like history a sort of analog of the uncertainty principle is found. It lies basically in the fact that the historian knows what happened afterwards and therefore can never really describe the "initial conditions" of his system in a way which is independent of his own perspective. In seeking to discern the underlying causes of events he inevitably tends to stress those factors which demonstrably influenced events in the way they actually came out, minimizing factors or tendencies which did not develop even though the relative strengths of the two tendencies may have been very evenly balanced at that time. The modern historian, of course, tends to be very aware of this uncertainty principle and to allow for it as much as possible. Again, while there is probably little intellectual connection between these various attitudes in the different disciplines, there is a general intellectual climate which stresses the interaction between the observer and the system being observed, whether it be in history, physics, or politics. 75</page><page sequence="11">HARVEY BROOKS There are a number of themes in science having a somewhat more direct and traceable intellectual connection between different disciplines. Here I should like to mention three, namely, energy, feedback, and information. Each of these is a highly technical con cept in physics or engineering; however, each also has broad and increasing ramifications in other disciplines. Of these, the oldest and most loosely used is probably energy. This concept is closely associated with that of "transformation." That is, the reason energy is a useful concept is that it has many different forms or manifesta tions which may be transformed into each other. In physics it is probably the most general and unifying concept we have. All phys ical entities or phenomena, including "matter" or "mass," are forms or manifestations of energy. Though it may be transformed, its quantity is "invariant," and this is what makes it important. The concept of energy has, of course, been important in biology almost as long as in physics. Living matter functions by transforming energy, and much of the early science of physiology was concerned with studying the transformations of energy in living systems. But the term "energy" has also found its way into many other fields of knowledge, where it is used often more metaphorically than with precise significance. Nevertheless, even in its metaphorical use it tends to partake of some of the characteristic properties of physical energy; namely, it is subject to transformation into different forms, and in the process of transformation the total energy is in some sense preserved. One speaks of psychic energies, historical energies, social energies. In these senses energy is not really measurable, nor is it directly related to physical energy. Nevertheless, like physical energy it can be released in the form of enormous physical, mental, or social activity; and, when it is, we tend to think of it as somehow "potential" in the pre-existing situation. The term "tension" denotes a state of high potential energy, like a coiled spring; and a high state of tension, whether social or psychological, is usually followed by a "release" or conversion into kinetic energy or activity of some variety. Thus the language of energy derived from physics has proved a very useful metaphor in dealing with all sorts of social and psychological phenomena. Here the intellectual connection is more clear than in the case of relativity or uncertainty, but it is more metaphorical than logical. The concept of feedback is one of the most fundamental ideas of modern engineering. It underlies the whole technology of auto 76</page><page sequence="12">Scientific Concepts and Cultural Change matic control and automation. The original concept was quite re stricted in application. It arose in connection with the design of electronic amplifiers in which a part of the output was fed back into the input in order to control the faithfulness with which the amplifier would reproduce in the output the form of the input signal.5 An amplifier with what is called negative feedback repro duces the time behavior of the input more faithfully than the same amplifier without feedback, the more so the greater the feedback. The concepts and methods of analysis originally developed for amplifiers were rapidly applied to control systems, where they had a far more fundamental influence. In recent years the feedback concept has been extended still further to embrace the idea of "in formation feedback," which is important in biological and social phenomena as well as in the engineering of physical systems. The idea has been stated by Forrester6 in the following way: "An information feedback system exists whenever the environ ment leads to a decision that results in action which affects the environment and thereby influences future decisions." At first this may seem unrelated to amplifiers and control sys tems, but if we identify "environment" with "input" and "decision" with "output" we can readily see how the more general definition includes amplifiers and control systems as a special case. In the case of the amplifier the decision is completely and uniquely de termined by the environment, but the concept of information feed back applies equally well when the decision is a discrete rather than a continuous function and when it is related to the environ ment only in a probabilistic sense. In this more general use of the words environment and decision we can see many examples of the information feedback concept in biology and the social sciences. For example, the process of natural selection in evolution is itself a type of feedback. The selection process?the particular population which survives in each genera tion^?is the decision, and this is fed back into the genetic constitu tion of the next generation; in this way the characteristics of the population adjust to the environment over successive generations. The muscular activities of animals also illustrate information feedback. In this case, the environment, which must be considered as including both the external environment and the relation of the body to it, influences the decision through perception. The work of the muscles is the analog of the amplifier or controller, and the perception of the organism provides the feedback loop. The 77</page><page sequence="13">HARVEY BROOKS process of learning may be readily regarded as an information feedback system. Indeed the theory behind the teaching machine is essentially designed to establish a tighter feedback, through the process of "reinforcement," which helps the student to decide whether he has learned correctly. Much of the concern with the techniques of teaching is related to improvement of the feedback loop in the learning process. The consideration of such processes as learning or cultural evolu tion as feedback systems would be merely a convenient metaphor, like energy, were it not for the fact that information feedback sys tems have certain general properties which tend to be independent of their particular embodiment. The two most important properties are those of stability and response. There exists a whole theory of the stability of feedback systems, which depends on the amplifica tion or "gain" of the system and the time delays which occur throughout the whole decision-environment-decision loop. High gain and large time lags tend to produce instability which will cause the system as a whole to "hunt," that is, the state of the system oscillates in a more or less uncontrolled way about the position of adjustment to the environment. The term "response" relates to the closeness and rapidity with which the system in ques tion will adjust to a changing environment; this is analagous to the closeness with which the time behavior of the output of a feed back amplifier will reproduce the time behavior of the input. The mathematics of the stability of linear amplifiers and control systems?that is, physical systems in which the output or "decision" is directly proportional to input or "environment"?is highly elab orated and well understood. Real feedback systems, however, are often non-linear, probabilistic in nature, and discrete rather than continuous. The mathematics for dealing with such systems is not very well developed, and for this reason it has not, until recently, proved very profitable to look at biological or social systems from the standpoint of information feedback. However, the advent of the high speed digital computer has speeded up the processes of ordinary arithmetical calculation by a factor of more than a million and has brought much more complicated and pathological (from the mathematical standpoint) systems within the purview of calcu lation. The usefulness of the computer lies in the fact that the behavior of feedback systems depends on only certain of their abstract properties; these properties, in turn, can be readily modeled or "simulated" on a computer. Thus we are enabled to study the 78</page><page sequence="14">Scientific Concepts and Cultural Change dynamics of the model in great detail and, if necessary, at a speed much greater than that of the real life situation. It is now being recognized that many types of unstable behavior that occur in biological and social systems are, in fact, examples of unstable feedback systems, the instability usually arising from unacceptable time lags in the transmission of information through the system. A case which is by now fairly well documented is that of inventory policy in a business.7 In times of high demand a busi ness may tend to build up inventory in anticipation of future de mand, and this further increases demand; but there is a lag between orders and production as well as between the measurement of demand and the decision to increase inventory. This can have the effect of introducing a highly fluctuating factory output in a situa tion in which the external demand is actually rather steady. For rester8 has given an analysis which suggests strongly that exactly this model may account for the notorious instability of production and employment in the textile industry. It seems highly likely that the business cycle in the economy as a whole represents a form of feedback instability to which many individual elements of decision making contribute through their time lags. In fact all forms of social decision making tend to con tain an inherent time lag arising from the fact that anticipations of the future are simply linear extrapolations of past trends. Thus one can even discern a similar tendency in history for political and social attitudes towards public issues to be those appropriate to the experience of the recent or distant past rather than to the actual situation which is faced. For example, the philosophies of laissez faire economics were conditioned by the mercantile and pre-indus trial era in which the principal problem was the inhibiting effects of state interference in the economy. Or, to take a more recent example, early post-war American economic policy was based on the fear of a major depression similar to what followed the first war, while much of present public thinking is based on the fear of inflation of the type which followed World War II. Such lags in social attitudes probably contribute to many of the cyclic phe nomena which are often attributed to history. Of course, the ex amples given above are somewhat crude oversimplifications, but the basic idea is one which may have quantitative as well as sug gestive or metaphorical value. Another possible example is the cycle in moral attitudes. Atti tudes towards moral values, because of the long time they take 79</page><page sequence="15">HARVEY BROOKS to diffuse throughout society, tend to lag behind the actual social conditions for which they were most appropriate. Thus, for example, Victorian attitudes towards sex arose partly as a reaction to the extreme laxity which existed in previous times, and conversely modern liberal attitudes towards sex are to some extent a response to the social and psychological effects of Victorian repression. Such attitudes tend to go in cycles because their inherent time lag pro duces unstable feedback in the social system. Such lags are espe cially important in the dynamic or "high gain" cultures characteristic of the West. The problem of stability in feedback theory is relevant to situa tions in which the environment without considering feedback is more or less constant. When an unstable feedback situation exists, the system "hunts" about the stable situation of adjustment to the environment. The other important concept, however, is that of the response of the system to environmental changes imposed from without, or, in amplifier terminology, the faithfulness and speed with which the output follows the input. This introduces the idea of "optimization" in control systems. An optimized system is one which responds to its environment in the best way as defined by some quantitative criterion. Of course, the optimal configuration of the control system will be dependent on the properties of the environment to which it is expected to respond or adapt. We can imagine an environment which is subject to short-term and long term changes and a feedback system which is optimized for the short-term changes occurring during a certain period. If the nature of the short-term changes also varies slowly in time, then the feed back system will not remain optimum. We could then imagine a feedback system whose properties change with time in such a way as to keep the response optimal as the short-term changes in the environment occur. The continuing optimization can itself be de scribed as a form of information feedback. For example, we can imagine a man learning a game requiring great physical skill. When he has learned it, his muscular and nervous system may be thought of as a feedback system which has been optimized for that partic ular game. If he then engages in a new game, his muscles and nerves will have to be optimized all over again for the new game, and the process of learning is itself a form of information feedback. In this way we arrive at the concept of a whole hierarchy of feed back systems?of systems within systems, each operating on a dif ferent time scale and each higher system in the hierarchy consti 80</page><page sequence="16">Scientific Concepts and Cultural Change tuting the learning process for the next lower system in the hierarchy. In the technical literature these hierarchies are referred to as adap tive control. Adaptive control systems appear to "learn" by experi ence and thus come one step closer to simulating the behavior of living systems. In fact we may imagine that biological and social systems are information feedback systems with many more super imposed hierarchies than we are accustomed to dealing with in physical control systems. The other key idea from engineering which has had an im portant impact on social and biological theory is that of informa tion, and the closely associated concept of noise. The idea that information was a concept that could be defined in precise mathe matical terms was recognized by Leo Szilard in 1929.9 Szilard was the first to point out the connection between the quantity of in formation we have about the physical world and the physical con cept of the entropy of a system. However, Szilard's ideas lay fallow until twenty years later when they were rediscovered by Shannon10 and precisely formulated in their modern form?the form which has revolutionized modern communications. There is a very close rela tion between information and probability. In fact, the amount of information in an image or a message is closely connected with its deviations from a purely random pattern. The concept of informa tion is basic to the quantitative study of language and has provided one of the cornerstones of a new science known as mathematical linguistics. It is also generally recognized that the transmission of genetic properties from generation to generation is essentially a communication of information. This has led to the idea of the "genetic code" which contains all the information necessary to reproduce the individual. So far the attention of biologists has mostly been focused on the elementary code, that is, on the rela tionship between the structure of the DNA molecule and the genetic information which it carries. The possibility of precise definition of the quantity of informaton in a system, however, opens up the possibility of considering evolution from the standpoint of a system of information transmission.11?a type of study which is still in its infancy. A remarkable consequence of information concepts is the realization that the information embodied in the biological con stitution of the human race is essentially contained in the total quantity of DNA in the human germ cells?at most a few grams 81</page><page sequence="17">HARVEY BROOKS in the whole world. One suspects that it may be possible to apply information concepts similarly to the study of cultural evolution and to the transmission of culture from generation to generation. One cannot talk about information without considering noise, which is the random background on which all information must ultimately be recognized. By its very nature noise is the absence of information. When an attempt is made to transmit a definite piece of information in the presence of noise, the noise destroys a definite amount of the information in the transmission process. No transmission system is completely faithful. Noise is, in the first instance, a physical concept; but, as in the case of information and feedback, the concept may be extended in a somewhat vague way to social and biological systems. For example, in evolutionary theory the "noise" is the random variations in the genetic constitu tion produced by cosmic radiation and other external influences on the genetic material. In the transmission of cultural information, the "information" communicated by a piece of literature or a work of art depends not only upon the intrinsic information content of the work but also on the experience and education of the recipient. Unless the artist and the recipient have had the same experience, the communication is always less than faithful. In the foregoing I have tried to suggest how a number of im portant themes from the physical and biological sciences have found their way into our general culture, or have the potential for doing so. In the case of the concepts of feedback and information, the ideas appear to have an essentially quantitative and operational significance for social and cultural dynamics, although their appli cation is still in its infancy. The most frequent case is that in which a scientific concept has served as a metaphor for the description of social and political behavior. This has occurred, for example, in the case of the concepts of relativity, uncertainty, and energy. In other cases, such as evolution and psychoanalysis, the concept has entered even more deeply into our cultural attitudes. References 1.
