(Scriptores Latini Hiberniae, VII.) Dublin: The Dublin Institute of Ad vanced Studies, 1968. 50J. Mr. Sheldon-Williams, with the assistance, generously acknowledged in the Foreword, of Professor Bieler, is making a most important contri bution to scholarship and to our understanding of Christian thought by his excellent critical edition of Eriugena's great work, of which this is the first volume. For the first time we have an edition of Eriugena which not only takes account of all the manuscripts but clearly displays the development of the Periphyseon (Eriugena's own title for the last recension of his work), as it can be traced in the earliest manuscripts,</page><page sequence="2">668 REVIEWS contemporary with the author and perhaps in part in his own hand. This development is clearly and interestingly discussed in the Intro duction. There is a very full apparatus criticus. The text is accompanied by an English translation which is both accurate and readable and will be a great help to many readers in understanding the difficult thought of the author. The notes are probably, because of the requirements of the series in which the book is published, a good deal less full than the commentary which the editor would have liked to produce and would have been entirely capable of producing. But they give in a small space a very great deal of information about Eriugena's vocabulary and way of translating his Greek authorities and about the sources of his thought. There are perhaps one or two places where it would have been worth briefly indicating some remoter origins or earlier appearances of ideas which appear in the text than are in fact given. Behind the discus sion on motion and rest in God (pp. 60-2) there appears to lie the very interesting Neoplatonic interpretation of Plato, Sophist, 254-5, °f which Plotinus makes much use in his account of the Divine Intellect. And in the account of the Neoplatonic origins of the triad Being-Intelligence Life in n. 77 it would have been interesting to have a reference to its importance in the Trinitarian thought of an earlier Western theologian, Marius Victorinus. The peculiar importance of Eriugena in the history of Christian thought is that he introduced into Western Christendom the great tradi tion of Eastern Christian philosophical theology, which had its roots in the Cappadocian Fathers, and underwent a remarkable development in and after 'Dionysius' which reached its climax in the theology of St. Maximus. Eriugena was, of course, an original thinker, and presents the tradition very much in a form of his own. Like everyone else in his period he has authorities, and his principal authorities are the Cappado cians, 'Dionysius', and Maximus. But he does not believe in submitting reason to authority: true authority, he thinks, should not require such submission, and does not require it, for it is nothing else than truth discovered by reason and transmitted to posterity by the Holy Fathers (p. 198). Sheldon-Williams (following Hauréau) in his note on the passage rightly compares with Eriugena's attitude to authority the words of another Irishman, St. Columbanus, to the Pope: 'Your power will last as long as your reason is sound' (p. 243). This great edition of Eriugena will, we must hope, lead to a great deal of further study of his thought, and a solidly based judgement on his contribution to Christian thinking must await its completion. But the first volume already makes clear that Eriugena is not (as has some times been thought) a pantheist. He is, rather, a traditional theist who</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 669 faces and states with great clarity some rather paradoxical conclusions of the language which we are accustomed to use about God. Other people who use this traditional language, including some critics of Eriugena, are rather inclined to evade these conclusions, or ignore them, but none the less they seem to follow. For theists who do not lapse more or less, consciously or unconsciously, into anthropomorphism, or make God a part, even if the most important part, of a universal whole greater than himself, there is a real sense in which God is everything. If he is creator in the strong sense, not just a Demiurge or Prime Mover, then nothing has a being of its own or an essence of its own which is not God. He really is the being and essential form of all things, and in a sense creates himself in creating them, as Eriugena, following and developing his Greek sources, says. (His explanations of the sense in which it can be said that God 'creates and is created', pp. 62-6 and 204, show clearly that he cannot be dismissed as a pantheist.) There is no positive reality in John the Scot, or his editor, or his reviewer, or his book, or this review, which is not God: yet God (as Eriugena continually insists) remains wholly other in his ineffable infinity, and our failings and limitations are not to be attributed to him. One of the great virtues of Eriugena is that he forces us to think seriously about this fundamental paradox in the tradi tional doctrine of creation. A. H. Armstrong Α. Η.
