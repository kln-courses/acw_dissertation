Between our heads and our work we make a who genuinely seemed to admire and enjoy what I was figure eight, or something like that, doing at a time when my work was barely known.

RQ I find that doing a museum show stops you in time. And, ugh, how could you ever think about painting another painting again? But you have to, and you do. AS I've noticed that sometimes the next show after someone's survey show is fan tastic—because all of that work has been thoroughly seen and digested—and they can move on to what they really meant. Anyway, yeah, the ICA show includes work from the '80s! RQ See, to me that would just be so hard to show. AS It is terribly embarrassing. I called Helen Molesworth, the curator, at one point and said that I hated the first two rooms worth of work. RQ Are you doing it chronologically? AS Mostly chronologically, but we are including a whole spectrum of funny side stuff as well—so, we're hanging the paintings chronologically with non-chrono logical videos and zines and cartoons. You know, I've been doing cartoons and stuff like that forever, it's just that I didn't think of putting them into my painting shows until 2009.

Your relations, and your specific ways in and out of those relations, are different from mine, but maybe we have a funny parallel.
