<plain_text><page sequence="1">GAYANA JURKEVICH Unamuno's Intrahistoria and Jung's Collective Unconscious: Parallels, Convergences, and Common Sources N HIS pioneering study of the Spanish Generation of 1898, Pedro Lain Entralgo wrote: "No creo que sea violento establecer una rela- ci6n inmediata entre la 'intrahistoria' de Unamuno y la tesis del 'incon- sciente sobrepersonal o colectivo' de Jung" (151). He was the first to express this opinion; Carlos Blanco Aguinaga has since remarked that "... evidente ya en las paginas de En torno al casticismo, cuando al dejar las metaiforas para expresar la idea escueta, [Unamuno] declara que la intrahistoria es la inconciencia" (236). More recently, Francisco Fernandez Turienzo again made a connection between intrahistoria and Jung's notion of the collective unconscious: "En todo caso, hemos tropezado con la 'intrahistoria,' con el sentido universal de lo 'castizo,' que seri luego lo 'inconsciente colectivo' (Jung)" (49-50). None of these suggestive observations, however, has been the object of substantive critical inquiry. I suggest that understanding the points of contact between intrahistoria and the collective unconscious is crucial, not only because it shows that Unamuno anticipated some of the most fundamen- tal teachings of depth psychology, but also because such an understand- ing is indispensable to readings of Paz en la guerra, and Unamuno's last, great novel, San Manuel Bueno, mdrtir. Unamuno and Jung came from similar family backgrounds; more importantly, they were nurtured by the same late nineteenth-century European Zeitgeist. The adolescent and young adult years of both men 43</page><page sequence="2">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE were those in which positivism reigned nearly unchallenged: anything that could not be proven by the laws of science or by the accumulation of data was discounted as irrelevant. No mysterious "unknowable" existed, since according to Herbert Spencer, what was unknown today would become known through the advances of science tomorrow (Al- berich 66). Evolutionistic determinism ruled the social sciences while realism and naturalism pervaded the world of letters. Within this intel- lectual climate, Unamuno and Jung elected, at one point in their lives, to pursue very similar courses of study: in 1888 Unamuno competed for a chair in psychology and ethics, while Jung entered medical school in 1895 and later chose to specialize in psychiatry. This shared interest in human mental life was perhaps the single most important factor in establishing a common ground for both. Although Unamuno was unsuccessful in obtaining an academic pos- ition in the field of psychology, his interest in the subject clearly began while he was still a university student, and continued beyond his failed attempt to enter the field professionally.1 Responding to an inquiry made by Federico Urales, Unamuno remarked: "Dificil me seria pre- cisar los origenes de mi pensamiento, porque en un periodo de diez o doce afios, del 80 al 92, lef enormemente, y de cuanto me cala en las manos, sobre todo de psicologia (de psicologia fisiol6gica, Wundt, James, Bain, Ribot, etc., a que he hecho oposiciones).. ." (9: 817). Physiological psychology dominated the fledgling science in its de- velopmental stages, and although the creators of depth psychology were to move away from their exclusive reliance on laboratory techniques prevalent in the discipline, its literature was the first available not only to Unamuno, but also to Freud, only eight years Unamuno's senior, and to Jung, eleven years Unamuno's junior. Given Unamuno's interest in psychology, it is curious that he scarcely mentions Freud, whileJung appears not to have attracted don Miguel's notice at all.2 Any coinci- dence between Unamuno and Jung must therefore be attributed to causes other than direct intellectual contact. While both Jung and Unamuno were clearly products of nineteenth- century positivism, their adult development may be considered a reac- tion to the dehumanizing aspects of its overly rational and materialistic ideology. Perhaps because they were both raised in religious family SUnamuno's continuing interest in psychology is attested to by the many books on psychological topics found in his library, and by his confession to P. Milgica that had he been able to choose a profession according to personal preference, he would have chosen psychology, political economy, or linguistics (F. Larrain 248). 2 The reference to Freud occurs in "El contra-mismo" (1918; 4: 1430). In his library Unamuno had only one volume of L6pez Ballesteros's 1922 translation of Freud's Complete Works (Valdes 88). 44</page><page sequence="3">UNAMUNO &amp; JUNG environments, Unamuno and Jung managed to preserve their ties to the world of the emotions, the spirit, and the unknown despite the influence of their formal education. This childhood heritage may have inculcated in them a natural predisposition to the neo-Romantic current that from 1860 to 1914 ran parallel with turn-of-the-century positivism (Russell 173). Following a youthful enthusiasm for the scientific orientation of the day, Jung and Unamuno moved away from what they regarded as the depersonalized scientism of the age. In 1895, at the height of his involve- ment with German socialist thought, Unamuno admitted to Pedro Milgica that his ideological correligionarios had begun calling him a "mystic" (Fernandez Larrain 207). By 1898, Unamuno was distancing himself from positivism as well as from socialist Germany, observing that "sigo aferrado a la Alemania romaintica, la de Uhland" (F. Larrain 250). By 1902 he had clearly turned his back on the positivist ethos, remarking that "... hay que predicar de continuo contra esa barbarie de la supremacfa de los conocimientos de aplicaci6n..." (Unamuno 1: 1017). Jung experienced a similar conflict between the outside world and his own spiritual leanings. While still a medical student immersed in a laboratory environment, he found time to deliver, to a select university club, a lecture titled "Reflections on the Attitudes to Christianity, With Special Attention to Albrecht Ritschl" (Hannah 65).4Jung left medical school convinced of the existence of an unconscious mind (Stein 25-26), and wanting to distance himself from the materialism of the physiolog- ical psychology prevalent in his day. In his clinical experience as a young psychiatrist, Jung noticed an inexplicable recurrence of mythological motifs in the dreams and fan- tasies of a great number of his patients.Jung's search for an explanation of this occurrence led him to read a wide variety of material, including the work of the Romantic philosophers of Nature and that of their successors, the German Volksgeist theorists. This "deviance" on Jung's part from the biologically oriented sexual theories of Sigmund Freud was ultimately responsible for the break between them. Since Freud considered metaphysical inquiry superfluous and mythology a danger (Ellenberger 525), he became as suspicious ofJung's "mysticism" (Stein 84) as socialist colleagues had become of Unamuno's. Like Jung, Unamuno was familiar with the work of the German Volksgeist theorists, and also had an extensive knowledge of Romantic SCf. letter to Clarin, also dated May 1895, in which Unamuno twice states: "Yo tambien tengo mis tendencias misticas" (Epistolario 53). 4 Both Unamuno and Jung were interested in liberal Protestant theology.

It is therefore not surprising that while his- torians of psychology agree that some ofJung's most important sources are to be found in the Romantics (Ellenberger 657, 728), most Hispanists concur that the background of Unamuno's intrahistoria is "almost en- tirely romantic" (Earle 328). It appears, then, that the common sources of intrahistoria and the collective unconscious might have their more remote origins in Romantic philosophy and "psychology," and that J. W. Butt's conclusion that Unamuno "borrowed the notion of Volksgeist [e.g., national spirit] almost unaltered from the best-known German linguists and psychologists" (14), warrants some amplification.6 Prior to the acceptance of Volksgeist theory as a "science of man," and its evolution to the new field of "ethnopsychology," the German Romantics were the first to engage in the study of other cultures -their folklore, traditions, and popular literature (Ellenberger 201). In de- veloping his theory of the collective unconscious, Jung found much supporting material and guidance in the "philosophers of the uncon- scious": the Protestant theologian Schleiermacher (1768-1834), Schel- ling (1775-1854), Schopenhauer (1788-1860), Carl Gustav Carus (1789- 1868), Eduard von Hartmann (1842-1906), and Nietzsche (1844- 1900) -all of whose views, according to Jung, focus on "the obvious uniformity of the unconscious" (5: 176). It is widely accepted among historians of the discipline that depth psychology would be unintelligible without the context of Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, and that Jungian psychology in particular is enhanced when related to Schelling's "Phi- losophy of Nature" (Ellenberger 204, 542). With the exception of Carus, the work of all the writers who influenced Jung was equally familiar to Unamuno.i SAlso see J. W. Butt 13 and Mor6n Arroyo 240-41. Mor6n Arroyo's opinion that "...se puede relacionar la intrahistoria con el Volksgeist de los rominticos" (240-41) must be clarified. Mor6n Arroyo refers to the specifically Romantic notion of folk or national spirit which should not be confused with the more complex and "scientific" ideas elaborated approximately half a century later by the Volksgeist theorists. The present study considers the Romantic and the Volksgeist notions of "folk/national spirit" as separate, but compatible. 6 Volksgeist theory was popularized by the anthropologist Theodor Waitz (1813-1866), and his students Heymann Steinthal (1823-1899) and Moritz Lazarus (1824-1903). Al- though references to all three men are numerous in Unamuno's early essays, it is impos- sible to determine what he may have read, since his library contains none of their work, and his essays make no specific allusions to any particular study either by Wvaitz or by his disciples. Jung was familiar with Waitz's Anthropologie der Naturvolker (5: 318), and references to Steinthal's work in comparative mythology abound in Jung's Symbols of Transformation. For a detailed account of the bearing Volksgeist theory had on both Jung and Unamuno, see the first chapter of my forthcoming book, The Elusive Self Archetypal Approaches to the Novels of Miguel de Unamuno [Missouri, 1991]. 7Cf. Ellenberger 542 and 729; Valdes 111, 293, 225, 173, 224. 46</page><page sequence="5">UNAMUNO &amp; JUNG To understand the dichotomies that permeate Jungian psychology, and the dialogic relationships that lie beneath much of Unamuno's work, we must turn to the "great instigator of the Romantic movement," the philosopher/historian Johann Gottfried Herder (Koepping 54). Anticipating Hegel, Herder (1744-1803) perceived a dialectical relation- ship between tradition and progress, and thought of historical events as "outward forms" sustained by an "inner force" (Barnard 135, 155) - concepts fundamental to Unamuno's view of intrahistoria.8 As both Unamuno and Jung were to do, Herder inferred man's essentially dual nature, using the term "Doppelgesch6pf' to describe the two opposite worlds contained in every man. Herder postulated that this duality was responsible for the inner struggle in Man, whose task it was to reduce the incompatibilities at the source of the conflict (Barnard 135). Anticipating Jung, Herder also spoke of"individuation" in reference to a "conscious becoming" or to the "development of the Self to its maximum realization" (Barnard 48).9 In Jung's teaching, the process of individuation, or a recognition and integration of the unconscious contents of the psyche into consciousness, is the most important goal of human life. Psychic totality is achieved by eliminating as many of an individual's inner polarities as possible, and by moving away from ego-centeredness toward the wholeness of a fully integrated Self (5: 408; 9, i: 42, 181). Bringing the unconscious life to the light of consciousness was also an important part of Una- muno's world view, and he regarded it as crucial to achieving a fullness of self. He observed in a German periodical (1896) that "In the darkest layers of our unconscious dwells the collective spirit (Kollectiv-Seele)... we must illuminate it with the light of our consciousness, bringing it to life to assist our individuality towards full social realisation" (quoted in Butt 22-23). Thus, in En torno al casticismo (ETC), Unamuno advised Spanish political leaders to seek out their eternal traditions, making conscious in themselves that which in the people remained at the uncon- scious or purely intuitive level: "La tradici6n eterna es lo que deben buscar los videntes de todo pueblo, para llevarse a la luz, haciendo 8 Unamuno was familiar enough with Herder to be able to appraise his literary style, and to include him among the "grandes clisicos germanos," Goethe, Schiller, Lessing, and Heine, themselves among his favorite authors (4: 533). -Jung does not make any reference to Herder's work in his own, but the possibility that he had some knowledge of Herder's ideas is almost certain, since one ofJung's most important sources, Adolf Bastian (1826-1905), acknowledged Herder as his spiritual mentor (Koepping 28). While Unamuno does not appear to have known Bastian's work, a connecting link between Herder and Bastian is provided by Steinthal and Lazarus (Koepping 55), whose work Unamuno apparently knew quite well. Bastian's thought is largely based on notions first espoused by Herder, and later developed by the Volksgeist theorists. 47</page><page sequence="6">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE conciente [sic] en ellos lo que en el pueblo es inconciente, para guiarle asi mejor" (1: 794). Dualism was fundamental to the Romantic Weltanschauung, playing an especially prominent role in Schelling's Philosophy of Nature, which saw the world in terms of pairs of antagonistic, yet complementary forces and ascribed particular importance to the male/female dichotomy (Ellenberger 203). Prior to Jung's postulating that "in the unconscious of every man there is hidden a feminine personality, and in that of every woman a masculine personality" (9, i: 284)--the animus and anima archetypes so fundamental to analytical psychology- Novalis went as far as to posit man's drive to perfect himself through the beloved, and conversely, to help the beloved reach perfection through relatedness to her lover (Ellenberger 201).10 As early as 1887, Unamuno echoed the Romantic concept of male/female polarity in a metaphorical description of his ideal vision of community development: ". .. como el hombre busca en la mujer y en el hombre la mujer lo que les falta, formando el verdadero individuo humano... vendrian unas razas a completar las otras.. ." (4: 155). Unamuno's intuition of the dichotomy between the unconscious, inner realm of intrahistoria and the conscious, external world of daily events seems to presage the essence of what was to become one kernel of discord between Freud and Jung. Whereas Freud proposed that the human unconscious contained nothing but material rejected or repres- sed by the individual mind, Jung argued that it consisted of two entirely unrelated levels. What Jung termed the "personal unconscious" was comparable to Freud's "unconscious," but he also posited a deeper layer of the human mind that he called the "collective unconscious of psychic representation," and that he thought was shared by the entire human race (6: 443). Unamuno, very much like Jung, preferred to use the term "intra-con- ciente" or "inconciente" [sic]. One year prior to publishing the essays of ETC, Unamuno remarked that by studying his own language, a man would become aware of "lo inconciente en nosotros," that is, of the common, unconscious psychic bond he shared with all other human beings (1: 880). As defined by Unamuno in ETC, intra-conciente has no resemblance at all to Freud's unconscious of repressed contents: Le llamo asi [intra-conciente], y no inconciente o subconciente, por parecerme estos thrminos inexactos. Lo que se suele llamar inconciente es de ordinario el contenido de lo conciente, sus entrafias, estai mas bien dentro que debajo de 61. (1: 814, nl) However much Unamuno rejects the term "unconscious," he neverthe- "0 Unamuno knew the work of both Schelling and Novalis (Friedrich von Hardenberg). See Valdes 293 and 111. 48</page><page sequence="7">UNAMUNO &amp; JUNG less anticipates itsJungian connotation." Similar toJung's unconscious, Unamuno's intra-conciente refers to a vital part of the human mind, a river of mental life running not below the threshold of consciousness, but within it, sustaining consciousness as the viscera sustain the outer, human body. Both Unamuno and Jung appear to have shared the view that human psychic life, perhaps history itself, is cyclical. Jung conceived the collec- tive unconscious as "an inherited brain which is the product of our ancestral life. It consists of the structural deposits or equivalents of psychic activities which were repeated innumerable times in the life of our ancestors" (17: 117). Unamuno, too, presented intrahistoria as a repository for ancestral patterns of apperception and behavior: "Estos hombres [los del pueblo] tienen un alma viva y en ella el alma de sus antepasados, adormecida tal vez, soterrada bajo capas sobrepuestas, pero viva siempre" (1: 815). Jung thought the collective unconscious an "ancestral heritage of possibilities ... common to all men" (8: 152). These possibilities of representation he called the "archetypes," or primordial images, which found individual expression in universally recognized mythological sym- bols (6: 443). The catholicity germane to the idea of an unconscious shared collectively by the human race is likewise present in Unamuno's reference to an "espiritu universal, [el] hombre que duerme en todos nosotros" (1: 791), and in his supposition that ". . . en la intrahistoria vive con la masa difusa y desdefiada el principio de honda continuidad internacional y de cosmopolitismo, el protoplasma universal humano..." (1: 869).12 Unamuno came close to inferring something comparable to Jung's belief that the archetypes of the collective uncon- scious reveal themselves in commonly shared mythological motifs; this is evident in the essay "Sobre el cultivo de la dem6tica," where he draws attention to the "profunda vida de los pueblos, leyendas o dichos que son tal vez el filtimo resto de potentes mitologias enterradas en el augusto silencio de los siglos dormidos" (9: 56). According to Jung, the archetypes, much like the instincts, were transmitted by heredity (8: 133), had never been in consciousness, and were not individually acquired (11: 50). Rather they constituted "a common psychic substrate of a supra-personal nature which is present " Fernandez Turienzo comes to a similar conclusion: "Unamuno, en contraposici6n a Freud,... no reduce lo inconsciente a lo reprimido" (56-57). 12 Unamuno also anticipated Jung's theory that an archetype of the collective uncon- scious could surface in an individual consciousness if stimulated by a "challenging experi- ence" lived by that individual (Ulanov 31). Speaking of the instinct of self-preservation, Unamuno remarked that it could provoke "el desarrollo de germenes espirituales, o mejor dicho, la irrupci6n en la conciencia de todo un fondo subconciente, que por falta de uso dormita allif" (1: 1166). 49</page><page sequence="8">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE in every one of us" (9,i: 3-4). Unamuno, too, saw heredity as playing an important role in the transmission of intrahistoria: Tradici6n, de tradere, equivale a "entrega," es lo que pasa de uno a otro, trans, un concepto hermano de los de transmisi6n, traslado, traspaso. Pero lo que pasa queda, porque hay algo que sirve de sustento al perpetuo flujo de las cosas. (1: 792) Unamuno represented intrahistoria metaphorically as the sea, its un- changing depths symbolic of the continuity of tradition, the sediment of time and history (cf. 1: 793). He saw tradition not only as the sustenance of history, but also as a tangible expression of the abstract concept "lo inconciente en la historia," which became an unmistakable equivalent of "the unconscious" in Unamuno's thinking. In his Diario intimo (1897-1902), Unamuno identifies the continuity implied by the idea of a "tradition" with the female sex: "La mujer es la base de la tradici6n en las sociedades, es la calma en la agitaci6n, es el reposo en las luchas" (8: 787). At the same time, Unamuno allies the female (mother) with the sea. He is fond of metaphors such as madre mar, mar materna, and describes the sea as a mother who lulls her children to sleep with the rhythmic sound of her waves ("A pesca de metaforas," 7: 901-903). From this series of analogies, a circular pattern emerges: intrahistoria, compared to the depths of the sea, is also referred to as "tradition," itself described as a concrete revelation of the unconscious element in history. Tradition is, furthermore, related to the female, who, like intra- historia, is not only the sustenance of progress, but also a link to the sea. Thus it may be ventured that Unamuno imagines the unconscious to be connected to the sea and, by extension, to the female, or mother.13 In analytical psychology, the sea, or any large body of water, "is the favorite symbol of the unconscious, the mother of all that lives" (ung 9, i: 177-78). The sea is the place of generation as well as that of death, and is represented iconically by the rise of the sun from its waters at dawn and its fall into the sea at dusk. The association Unamuno estab- lishes between intrahistoria (the unconscious), the sea, and the female, is exactly the same anthropomorphic connection Jung makes between the collective unconscious and its symbols, the Great Mother and the sea (5: 218, 289). Both Jung and Unamuno were intrigued by the New Testament story of Nicodemus, the Pharisee. In a great deal of Unamuno's work, regression to childhood, to the act of "un-birthing" oneself (desnacer), 1: Unamuno's analogy can be expressed in the following equation: intrahistoria=la tradici6n = la revelaci6n de lo inconciente = el fondo mismo del mar (1: 793) = la mujer (madre) = la tradici6n= la intrahistoria. Cf. Blanco Aguinaga: "Y es que el mar, mas aun que el campo o el monte, es, en su abismo y en su voz, como el seno de la madre" (276). 50</page><page sequence="9">UNAMUNO &amp; JUNG plays a meaningful role. For Unamuno both desnacer and desmorir amount to the same potential for rebirth, a rather consoling though for one as obsessed with the finality of death as he was. His interpretation of Nicodemus (3: 365-85; 9: 1220-22) may thus very well stem from a subliminal desire to recapture the untrammeled innocence of childhood. In Jung's view, Jesus sent Nicodemus a confusing message which the Pharisee interprets literally rather than allegorically. Speaking of man's spiritual rebirth, Christ used the female symbols water and spirit to refer to the individuation process. Nicodemus, however, understands the words of Christ to mean a literal return to the mother's womb. Mobilized by an instinctive response to the incest prohibition, Nicodemus rebels against Christ's "immoral insinuation," and is there- fore unable to comprehend the symbolic value of the parable. For Jung, Nicodemus represents man's simultaneous desire for, and resistance to, uroboric incest (5: 226-27, 331). The interpretation Unamuno offers of Nicodemus is similar toJung's, and is found in the little-known essay "Autoridad y poder, o el divino maestro y el fariseo" (November 21, 1931): ... el divino Maestro le dijo: "En verdad te digo que si alguien no naciese de nuevo no puede ver el reino de Dios." Y el fariseo le pregunt6 c6mo puede renacer sin volver al seno materno. Y Jesus respondi6: "En verdad te digo que si no naciese uno de agua y de espiritu no puede entrar en el reino de Dios" (9: 1221). Unamuno concludes the passage by noting that "el pobre fariseo tard6 en comprender lo de renacer de agua y de espiritu." In Jung's view, the fundamental importance of the Christian Church is the support system it extends to Man in helping him achieve a fully integrated self, and in teaching him to resist the temptation to live peacefully within the "realm of the mothers." There is an essential difference, however, in the way Jung and Unamuno interpret the de- nouement of this Biblical episode. While in analytical psychology only Man's ability to overcome the Mother guarantees a full process of individuation, Unamuno seems to imply that Nicodemus accepts the literal significance ofJesus's words, perceiving that a return to mother's womb is his only guarantee of perpetual life. Unamuno and Jung were equally taken by other Biblical passages. In his first novel, Paz en la guerra (1897), Unamuno quotes on several occasions Christ's words as recorded in Matthew 10: 34 ff: "Nuestro Sefior Jesucristo no vino a meter en la tierra paz, sino espada y fuego, lo dijo El mismo; vino a poner disensi6n y guerra, y a dividir los de cada casa.. ." (2: 288; cf. 255). The quotation is used to refer to the dual significance of war in the novel. On one level Unamuno suggests that peace cannot be properly valued without an experience of war, its 51</page><page sequence="10">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE opposite; on another level, however, war is used as a metaphor to describe the internal battle the character Pachico must wage before he overcomes his fear of death and the temporal existence of the self. Unamuno seems to imply here that the prerequisite for psychic peace is to be found only in the reconciliation of time and eternity, mortality and immortality. Jung was also fond of quoting the same passage from Matthew (ung 5: 311). In the study of archetypes, Christ represented for Jung the archetype of the Self, a whole in which opposites are successfully united (5: 368; 6: 460). According to Jung, Christ's words as recorded by Matthew are correctly interpreted as referring to the inner, psycholog- ical struggle for individuation. In Jung's opinion, if Man is to imitate Christ, he must cut off his family associations, especially with the mother, as he struggles to differentiate himself from the collective un- conscious she represents (6: 449). In La agonia del cristianismo, Unamuno returned once more to Matthew 10: 34-37, where his vision of individuation as separation from the collective coincides even more with that ofJung: "Para seguir a Cristo hay que dejar padre y madre, y hermanos, y esposa e hijos" (7: 308; cf. 341). The common ground, then, between Unamuno's and Jung's exegesis of this passage is that only by engaging in a struggle within himself can Man affirm his sense of individuality, and avoid slipping into the complacency of unconsciousness. That Unamuno had a similar intuition along these lines is evident in a passage from his long poem "El Cristo de Velazquez" in which he refers to the guerra creadora Jesus had willed to men, observing: "S61o en tu guerra espiritual nos cabe / tomar la paz.. ." (6: 428). Thus, both Jung and Unamuno seem to understand the words of Christ as a warning that the peace of individu- ation can be purchased only at the price of an uncompromising battle within the Self. As remarkable as is the coincidence of metaphorical expression be- tween Unamuno and Jung, the spiritual affinity they shared is nothing less than uncanny. Like Unamuno, Jung came from a religious family background, most of the male relatives on both sides of his family being either Protestant ministers or theologians. Again like Unamuno, Jung lost touch with his faith upon beginning a life of greater "historical consciousness" at the university. Steeped in the materialistic positivism of their intellectual environment, both young men began to question their faith, eventually moving away from an unqualified belief in Chris- tian dogma. Of these years, Jung wrote that "the farther away I was from the Church, the better I felt" (Memories 74-75). The seeds of religious doubt, however, were sown in both youths during their prep- aration for the first Communion/Confirmation. Of his experience Una- 52</page><page sequence="11">UNAMUNO &amp; JUNG muno noted: "De mi primera comuni6n recuerdo muy poco... Tanto y tanto se nos prepara para ella, tanto se le habla al nifio de delicias y consuelos que no necesita . . . tanto se le quiere sugestionar, que cuando Ilega el acto, el nifio, poco sugestionable en realidad, se queda frfo" (8: 128). Jung was prepared for Confirmation and Communion by his father, a Protestant pastor. This was a man, Jung realized years later, who was profoundly troubled because he had never permitted himself to "think" about the meaning of Church teaching, for fear that if he did, he would lose his faith entirely. As a young man, Jung became painfully aware that his father's suffering, much like that of Unamuno's Manuel Bueno, was the result of being torn between personal doubt and the apparent "belief without understanding" he felt obliged to maintain for the sake of his parishioners (Hannah 50-52). Jung later speculated that having been prepared for Confirmation by his father, he might unconsciously have assimilated some of the older man's religious mis- givings. Although Jung, much like Unamuno, recalled having prepared rather earnestly for the first Communion, hoping for an "experience of grace and illumination... nothing had happened. God had been ab- sent," and Jung remembered feeling himself cut off from the faith of his fathers (Memories 55). As an adult Jung observed that people who claimed to have an unquestioning (e.g., unthinking) belief in their faith were also those who continually exposed themselves to doubt. Truly thinking people, he argued, welcomed doubt since ironically it served as the surest way to a more profound kind of belief or knowledge of one's faith (11: 110). Jung's conclusion recalls Unamuno's condemnation of thefe del carbo- nero, his position in Del sentimiento trdgico de la vida that doubt is the basis of true faith, and his decision not to "poner paz entre mi coraz6n y mi cabeza, entre mi fe y mi raz6n; quiero mas bien que se peleen entre si" (7: 180). Jung and Unamuno also shared the feeling that the dogma of life after death was unsubstantiated myth. As is well-known, the irreversi- bility of bodily death caused Unamuno tremendous anguish: "Mi terror ha sido el aniquilamiento, la anulaci6n, la nada mas alla de la tumba" (8: 793). Jung was just as puzzled by the paradox of a supposedly benevolent Divinity who had created a "life of contradictions in which one creature devours another and life meant simply being born to die" (Memories 79). Although Jung claimed to be "religious" in the broadest sense of the word, his reservations, like Unamuno's, were prompted by doubts such as: "But it is not so certain as all that!" or "What about that thing under the ground?" (Memories 22). Unamuno found irony in hearing his fellow men speculate about the horrors of death: the lack 53</page><page sequence="12">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE of air and movement they might experience, or the darkness and rotting cadavers with whom they might have to share a crypt. He considered these projections mere absurdities since they did not take into account the fact that death precluded any continuation of life whatever. For Unamuno the greatest terror posed by death was the cessation of con- scious activity: "Es terrible estado de conciencia en que pensamos que no hay tal estado, el pensar que no pensamos da un vertigo de que ya la raz6n no cura" (8: 830). Jung resolved his dilemma with what came to be a favorite aphorism: "I cannot believe in what I do not know, and what I know I need not believe in" (Ellenberger 665). Jung's solution evokes Unamuno's re- working of the catechistic inquiry and response: "jQud cosa es fe?- Creer lo que no vimos." Like Jung, Unamuno was unable to believe in that for which no tangible proof could be supplied. And what he did not understand of Church teaching, Unamuno would not accept at face value. Therefore he reworded the traditional response to the query "jQud cosa es fe?" to read "iCreer lo que no vimos, no!, sino crear lo que no vemos" (1: 962). Clearly he chose not to cast his lot with gnosis, or the acceptance of "consecrated" knowledge, but with pistis, the re-creation of those aspects of the faith that he could not "see" (i.e., comprehend) to suit his personal needs."' Outside the personal and spiritual realm, Unamuno and Jung again crossed paths. Unamuno was fond of the paradoxical relationship be- tween fictional characters and their creators, pointing out that in this respect, fantasy tended to supersede reality. In Niebla, at the moment that Augusto Perez is informed of his pending demise, he reminds Unamuno: "Vamos a cuentas: jno ha sido usted el que no una, sino varias veces, ha dicho que Don Quijote y Sancho son, no ya tan reales, sino mas reales que Cervantes?" (2: 667). We are reminded, again in Niebla, that Hamlet was "uno de los que inventaron a Shakespeare" (2: 664). Jung had a theory that while an artist worked, his project, flowing from the depths of the unconscious, possessed and guided the artist's psychic life. Thus he surmised that it was not Goethe who created Faust, but Faust--the unconscious personified-who had "created" Goethe (15: 103). Goethe himself provided Jung and Unamuno with a metaphor that both used to express psychological extraversion and introversion. Jung considered Goethe's reference to the diastolic and systolic activity of the heart a brilliant intuition of the contrasting movements of psychic " Cf. letter to F. Larrain: "Pregunta: dQued cosa es fe? Respuesta: Creer lo que no vimos. No, no es eso fe, no, no" (171). Also "Sobre la filosoffa espafiola" (1904): "Cul- tivando la voluntad, convenciendonos de que la fe es obra de la voluntad y que la fe crea su objeto, asf, lo crea. . ." (Unamuno's ellipsis. 1: 1164). 54</page><page sequence="13">UNAMUNO &amp; JUNG energy: an extraverted reaching out to seize the moment coupled with a reflex action of detachment and withdrawal of energy from one's external surroundings (6: 4-5). In Del sentimiento trdgico de la vida, Una- muno also speaks of experiencing ". .. la diastole del alma y me empapo en vida ambiente, y creo en mi porvenir; pero al punto la voz del misterio me susurra idejarais de ser!, me roza con el ala el Angel de la Muerte, y la sistole del alma me inunda las entrafias espirituales en sangre de divinidad" (7: 133). Carlos Blanco aptly interprets Un- amuno's didstole to signify an opening up of consciousness to the outside, while szstole marks a turning inward, together with a recognition of one's limitations within the external environment (373). The coincidence of intellectual expression and spiritual vision be- tween Unamuno and Jung remains to be explained. In reference to Unamuno's ETC, can we agree with Fernandez Turienzo that "hemos tropezado con [lo] que sera luego lo 'inconsciente colectivo"'? Although some of the concepts Unamuno elaborates in the essays of ETC approx- imate those Jung was to develop early in the twentieth century, intrahis- toria is not altogether a comprehensive anticipation ofJung's "collective unconscious."'5 Both intrahistoria and the collective unconscious are, however, the products of a similar response on the part of two men to the same bibliographic sources and to a shared experience of the same historical moment. In short, Unamuno and Jung arrived at similar ideas because they shared a similar philosophical outlook. Unamuno himself explained that it was possible for contemporaries, working in different corners of the globe and having no knowledge of each other's work, to generate analogous results. Responding to his belated discovery of Pirandello, with whose work Italian critics compared his own, an as- tounded Unamuno suggested: Es un fen6meno curioso y que se ha dado muchas veces en la historia de la literatura, del arte, de la ciencia o de la filosoffia, el que dos espiritus, sin conocerse ni conocer sus sendas obras . . . hayan perseguido un mismo camino y hayan tramado andlogas concep- ciones o llegado a los mismos resultados. Dirfase que es algo que flotaba en el ambiente. O mejor dicho algo que late en las profundidades de la historia y que busca quien lo revele. (8: 501) In the instinctive repetition of tradition and psychic structures as data contained in the unconscious of Man, and in the proposal that intrahis- toria is the sustenance of history and the future, Unamuno's ideas herald those of Jung. " Jung, in fact, did not develop his ideas until approximately 1909, publishing them in book form in 1912 as Symbols of Transformation, now Volume 5 of The Collected Works (Memories 158; Philipson 50). 55</page><page sequence="14">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE The dichotomy Unamuno establishes between history and intrahis- tory, time and eternity in ETC, is recast as fiction in his first novel, Paz en la guerra. The sea and wave metaphor of the five essays is replaced in the novel by the dualism of peace and war, but the relationship Unamuno inferred between time and eternity remains unchanged: ETC: Asi como la tradici6n es la sustancia de la historia, la eternidad lo es del tiempo, la historia es la forma de la tradici6n como el tiempo la de la eternidad. (1: 794) PG: . . . paz en la guerra misma y bajo la guerra inacabable, sustentandola y coronindola. Es la guerra a la paz lo que a la eternidad el tiempo: su forma pasajera. (2: 300) The dialogue between history and intrahistory, time and eternity, in Paz en la guerra plays itself out against the backdrop of an industrial Bilbao under siege by Carlist forces implicitly identified with the com- mon folk of the Basque countryside, tradition, and Mother Nature. Jung perceived an affiliation between the past and the present similar to the dichotomy Unamuno envisioned between historia and intrahis- toria. Jung suggests that each succeeding generation not only inherits its past but with the aid of that heritage is able to go beyond the achievements of its predecessors: In so far as no man is born totally new, but continually repeats the stage of development last reached by the species, he contains unconsciously ...the entire psychic structure developed ...by his ancestors... That is what gives the unconscious its characteristic "historical" aspect, but it is at the same time the sine qua non for shaping the future. (9, i: 279-80) Although both Unamuno and Jung drew their ideas from the psychological intuitions of the Romantic philosophers, as well as from the notions of the Volksgeist theorists responsible for elaborating not a few of the Romantics' ideas on collective spirit, and for putting them on an acceptably "scientific" footing, Jung's findings tend toward psychological derivations, while those of Unamuno are primarily sociological in orientation. Jung, however, was an innovator while Un- amuno was not. A felicitous association of the comparative mythology, religion, and folklore learned from the methods of the ethno- psychologists, combined with his own strictly medical preparation, en- abled Jung create an entirely novel approach to individual psychology. En torno al casticismo, on the other hand, is the result of fact and intuition Unamuno gleaned from two separate but compatible courses of personal inquiry. His amalgam of positivist approaches to history, sociology, and physiological psychology was supplemented by reading the Roman- tic philosophers and Volksgeist theorists. Unamuno applied the results of this reading to the Spanish circumstance, and named it intrahistoria. If Unamuno was unsuccessful in making an original contribution to Spanish sociology, what he managed to accomplish for himself was of 56</page><page sequence="15">UNAMUNO &amp; JUNG tremendous importance. In pointing to intrahistoria as a vital legacy that would live on in future generations, Unamuno indicates a partial solution to his personal dilemma attaining of spiritual immortality. With a view to ensure its longevity, Unamuno took special care to endow intrahistoria with quasi-biological properties: El pueblo, el hondo pueblo, el que vive bajo la historia, es la masa comdin a todas las castas, es su materia protoplismica; lo diferenciante y excluyente son las clases e in- stituciones hist6ricas. Y 6stas solo se remozan zambull6ndose en aqu6l. (1: 867) According to this scheme, Unamuno would himself become part of the eternal, dynamic sediment of tradition, which the future would incor- porate into its own spirit and social organization. The pueblo and tradition as integral components of intrahistoria are also salient in Unamuno's novel, San Manuel Bueno, mdrtir. In its defini- tive avatar, intrahistoria is no longer a passive harboring of tradition in the collective, but a potential resurrection offered through a return to the Great Womb and its implied capacity to generate an infinity of births. Unamuno suggests as much in the prologue to his last, important novel: "Don Manuel busca, al ir a morirse, fundir-o sea salvar-su personalidad en la de su pueblo" (2: 1123). From the mythical village of Valverde de Lucerna submerged in the amniotic waters of the "lecho del lago," bells and voices of the deceased are heard in periodic com- munication with the living through whom they return to the activity of the surrounding banks: "en nosotros resucitaban en la comuni6n de los santos" (2: 1133). The "hondo pueblo, el que vive bajo la historia," which in ETC had only a figurative meaning, assumes in the sunken village a literal rep- resentation. The lake, whose waters carry a maternal significance, and in whose depths life continues undisturbed by the fluctuating currents of time and history, becomes an anthropomorphic symbol of intrahistoria, tradition, and the unconscious. In the communal womb of the lake, the past is restored and immortalized into a vibrant inheritance destined to become part of the collective spirit and life-experience of the present, and future generations.
