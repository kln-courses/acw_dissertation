<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS Physics, Psychology and Medicine: A Methodological Essay. By J. H. Woodger. Cambridge University Press, London, I956. Pp. x + 146. 8s. 6d. Tins book serves two distinct purposes, both equally well. It is prim- arily addressed to medical students and has the aim of helping them to cope effectively with the clinical problems presented by sick persons. But it makes, at the same time, a contribution to philosophy that is by no means negligible. The author has, in particular, much to say that is both significant and original about the nature of reality. The two purposes assist each other. The philosophy helps the medical student to arrive at the right kind of generalisations; the need, on the other hand, for being comprehensible to students who have not had a specialised training in philosophy has been an incentive to clear exposition. The author's effort to give the medical practitioner more insight into psychology than is provided by conventional medical studies is justified by a statement given to the House of Commons in 1954 and quoted in this book that out of 500,000 hospital beds under the National Health Service no fewer than 2 I,00o0 were for mental and mentally deficient cases. Nevertheless, as ProfessorWoodger says, the student is taught to regard human beings as no more than compli- cated pieces of machinery whose parts can go wrong in various ways. 'But,' he adds,' being miserable is not a way a machine can go wrong. Its correction seems to call for a different approach.' And later : 'We thus have two states of affairs : a medical training which is overwhelmingly physical, and a sick population containing a high proportion of cases which are not classified as physical.' To help these far more is obviously needed than a good bedside manner and a soothing personality. The medical practitioner also needs insight. When a patient has failed to come to terms with his emotions it is' the duty of the physician to help him to discover the source of his conflict and to overcome it'. It is pointed out that the present excessively physical bias in the medical training arises from the very great prestige that the physical sciences have achieved in recent times. The aim of physics is complete objectivity; subjective statements have no place in its discipline. The only valid state- ments in the physicist's universe of discourse are impersonal ones, statements that eliminate the observer. As Professor Woodger puts it : 'In the early days of physics it was necessary to exclude the notion of person from science because in the province of physics it was not applicable. The resulting suc- cess of the physical sciences has not unnaturally had the effect . .. of exclud- ing this notion from science permanently, even from the science of persons itself.' Would that sundry prevalent schools of psychology could be persuaded to take note of this situation and reconsider their belief that psychology can be scientific only when all psychological contents have been 67</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS eliminated from it. In these schools anthropomorphic statements are deprecated, even about man; but not, most oddly, about electronic cal- culating machines ! While Professor Woodger does not, of course, deny the overriding importance of physiological study in a medical training, nor that this is principally a study of physical and chemical processes, he says sensibly 'it would seem that those who wish to emphasise the machine-like features of men would be well advised to content themselves with saying that men are machine-like, rather than that they are machines. Then there will be nothing to dispute about and time and effort can be spent more profitably.' It will already have become apparent that Professor Woodger attributes the present somewhat lopsided system of medical training to a defective philosophy. As a defective philosophy is, in turn, the consequence of an inadequate methodology, some space is given to logic and scientific method. A chapter entitled 'The Status of Explanatory Hypotheses' contains in seven pages as much substance as would have occupied over three times that space if couched in conventional philosophical language. Yet there is no lack ofprecision--a considerable achievement. A point that is stressed here and has a particular bearing on the philosophy of science concerns ex- planatory hypotheses. It is, says Woodger, 'erroneous and most mis- leading to speak of verifying an explanatory hypothesis. However many times observations may confirm the predictions of such a hypothesis, this does not entitle us to say that the hypothesis is true; although when a hypothesis is successful it is difficult not to believe that it is true.' This is obvious and has been said in a variety of ways before. But it has not yet been said often enough to prevent people over and over again from claiming in the name of science that they have verified a statement when it is no more than an unproved and unprovable hypothesis. The claim arises from the regrettable notion that all hypotheses are better ignored than faced, as though they were scientifically disreputable. There would be less temptation to ignore them if the difference between verifying and justifying a statement were better appreciated. One can verify a tautology but one can only justify a hypothesis, and this only in one way, namely by demonstrating its explanatory power. The book under review is likely to help the student to understand this. When he learns what a lot of hypotheses he uses every day he will be less inclined to insist that all traditional beliefs are irrefutable fact and to dismiss all new ideas as 'mere hypotheses '. The defective philosophy that Professor Woodger is seeking to correct is the one that denies, be it explicitly or by implication, the reality of subjective experience, that ignores the difference between the active subject and the passive object, and that sees the universe as composed exclusively of inter- acting material systems. The reality of subjective experience and the need for making a clear distinction between a person, his experience, and the 68</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS system on which he acts is presented in two chapters with the respective titles 'Getting' and 'Doing'. The approach is unconventional and none the worse for that. 'Tom is getting a view of the sea from his bedroom window' is given as an example of a statement in which information is conveyed about an observer, an object that is observed and the subjective experience of observing. Those philosophers who claim that the physicist's world of objective reality is the only real one should, if they were consistent, deprecate the form of words used in the above sentence with its implications of an irreversible relation between subject and object and of a subjective experience that has no place in the physicist's universe of discourse. This means that one can preserve the philosophy according to which completely objective statements are the only true ones, but only at the cost of stripping one's speech of many statements with a meaningful content. This uncon- ventional way of exposing the fallacies in a whole collection of' isms' is neater than the method of ponderous analysis to be found in many essays with a more imposing appearance. This part of the book is pivotal to the whole argument and is, in the present reviewer's opinion, too condensed. Points that are made in a few words would better have been expanded into a paragraph. The chapter on 'Getting', in particular, repays being read twice. If Woodger were here merely reproducing one of the accepted and fashionable philosophies, the unconventional and over-condensed ap- proach would not matter; one could safely ignore what he says. But what is said here runs counter to the prevailing fashion and deserves for this reason, if for no other, to be noted carefully. Another way of expressing the defective philosophy from which the author would save the medical student is concisely put in the words' another tenet of this philosophy seems to be that everything that is, is in a big box called space, which is floating down a river called time. Consequently, if anything (except the river !) is not in space, it is just not at all.' Professor Woodger calls this' the finger and thumb philosophy 'and thereby conveys, I fear, the erroneous impression that this philosophy is an oddity subscribed to only by an eccentric few. But in fact it is at the root of many of the fashion- able ' isms '. The notion that the big box called space is the container of all active reality is hard to get away from. According to what is probably the majority view of reality any activity in the big box must necessarily originate with something else that is also in the box, and thus have location, be capable of detection by physical means and be described as a constituent of the material universe. The big box philosophy attributes all events, be they subjective or objective, to the unaided action of matter on matter. One philosophical system after another has been developed in a frantic attempt to preserve this notion. An early attempt was called ' physico-psychological parallelism', and another the theory that mind is an epiphenomenon. Somewhat later the philosophy of emergence came into fashion in which it 69</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS was claimed that the relationship between various contents of the box was the active cause of everything that can be observed, including subjective ex- perience. A present attempt to preserve the notion is by the construction of mechanical models of the human brain or of a tortoise. It is claimed that, with sufficient elaboration, models constructed to such patterns would truly represent the mind-body relationship. Every component part of these models is material and thus has its location in the big box. Those who claim that a sufficiently elaborate model would represent the whole system deny the existence of influences without location. What cannot be found in the big box is then said to be no more than a 'ghost in the machine', in- capable of influencing the way the contents in the box act on each other. In this connection another passage in the book under review is illumina- ting. It is concerned with metaphors used in psychology. Woodger points out that these employ a language applicable to objects with location, in other words to objects within the big box. He points out that such metaphors do not mislead so long as one does not take them literally. In metaphor, he points out, 'we say what we do not mean in order to convey what we do mean'. Nevertheless, one does tend to take the metaphors too literally; one does so, for instance, when one speaks of a notion as being 'inside ' one's head. Such habits of speech only confirm the philosophy according to which the mind-body problem can be wholly solved by a study of the contents of the big box. One might get away from the wasted time and effort spent on the mechanical models if the expression 'mind- body relationship' were to be replaced by 'mind-space relationship'. As it is, the big box philosophy has enslaved not only the cruder materialists but also some of the more idealistic philosophers. These often get no further than to assert that the big box, as it floats down the river of time, contains, in addition to gross matter, many fine things, thoughts and feelings, love and beauty, each properly located in space. It is difficult in- deed to surrender the notion that what is is somewhere. It is impossible to predict what next attempt at preserving the big box philosophy will become fashionable, but let it be hoped that Professor Woodger's book will have enough influence on future medical practitioners and others to make it a little more difficult for the next attempt to appear plausible.
