The very richness and diversity of their content render difficult an adequate review in the space at the reviewer's disposal, and he is of necessity reduced to the selection of those papers and sym- posia that may serve him as bases for brief critical remarks. We begin with the Proceedings. The presidential address by A. M. Whitehead is packed full of con- tent. It is in support of the position approached from another angle in the author's James-Scott lecture, delivered before the Royal Society of Edinburgh and reprinted in The Principle of Relativity. Professor Whitehead finds the primary ground of uniformity in nature in the "apprehended space-time continuum" which is required by the dis- crimination of reality from dreams-a continuum which is necessarily "determined in its totality" and which consequently is uniform (p. 8). There is, the author thinks, much wisdom in Hume's remarks on this subject; but he also feels that our analysis must go beyond Hume's (and Russell's) atomism. " The space-time continuum is not the sole basis of uniformity in nature," otherwise induction would be impossible (p. i2). If we are to get out of the difficulty into which such atomism leads us, we must find something in the single instance which would justify the mind's expectation that a given instance will be followed by another. " The key to the mystery is not to be found in the accumulation of instances, but in the intrinsic character of each instance. . . . This overlooked character of the single instance must be its significance of something other than itself " (p. 14). The 'in- gression' of sense-objects (pp. 7-8) signifies the perceptual objects. " The evidence is summed up in the statement that the ingression of sense-objects into nature involves events analyzable into space-time qualified by pervasive Aristotelian adjectives" (p. i6). Hence, the uniformity in nature. Contingency is, thus, "simplified into the con- tingency attaching to the simpler relations of perceptual objects to the events which they qualify" (p. I7). It would, I think, be enlighten- ing if Professor Whitehead would in some detail compare his position here with that which Kant holds on the same problem. If I am not mistaken in my apprehension of the situation, there is in it something of fundamental significance with respect to at least one side of the debate between realists and idealists. I do not clearly see any basal difference between Professor Whitehead's analysis and the traditional development of Kant's position, and I cannot help suspecting that concentration on the similarity might go far towards disclosing an- other 'meeting of extremes.'</page><page sequence="3">No. I.] REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 99 The paper by R. F. A. Hoernle (" Notes on the Treatment of 'Ex- istence' in Recent Philosophical Literature") directs attention to the problem of language and its role in thinking. The genetic approach is, I think rightly, emphasized. " It is, by common consent, through their meanings that words function as vehicles and instruments of thought. I suggest that it would be helpful to approach this situa- tion, not, as is usually done, by way of the questions, 'What are we thinking (or reasoning) about' or 'What is the object of our think- ing?' but by way of the question, 'What are we thinking (or reason- ing) with f Or, in other words, ' What do our words express ? '" (p. 27). As developed by Professor Hoernle in this paper, this seems to me a very helpful suggestion. But I also seem to detect a rather per- sistent and insidious danger in some of its implications. Of course, if we are to reason at all, we must understand what our words ex- press; and to this end, we may presumably say, a genetic study of our terminology is helpful and, indeed, necessary. Anselm's 'fool,' or anybody for that matter who fails to understand what the term 'God' means for Anselm, cannot hope to reason with him whether as de- fender or antagonist; and, presumably, the meaning of this term as used by Anselm can be grasped only by him who in some sense is sub- ject to the light which the good-saint's fides sheds (p. 24). Likewise, to argue with a philosopher concerning the 'totality of being,' com- prehension of what the particular philosopher understands by this phrase is of indispensable importance (pp. 30 ff.); and such compre- hension emerges, I am willing to admit, only when one places onself sympathetically within the sweep of the system of thought of which the phrase, is an expression. All of this seems fairly obvious in theory-though it must be confessed that our practice not infrequently falls rather far away from it. But having understood what we are thinking with, we have taken only the first step in our journey. 'What are we thinking about?' still remains to be answered; the genetic approach does not relieve us of the necessity of facing this question, and the answer to it is logically the crux of the debate. To understand the terms of an argument is one thing; but to estimate the force of the argument is quite another. I am not sure to what extent Professor Hoernle's discussion clearly envisages this distinction. When he says of the traditional ontological argument, for instance, that it " has its roots in fides, both psychologically and logically " (p. 25), one cannot help suspecting that this is meant in a sense which confuses comprehension with evaluation. In any event, this con- fusion should be guarded against; otherwise, so far at least as I can</page><page sequence="4">100 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXXIV. see, there is grave danger that wishes may become horses and that beggars may begin forthwith to ride. In a paper entitled "The One and the Many" Gerald Cator " at- tempts to challenge our possession of universal ideas and to submit an account of the source of our illusion that we have them" (p. 40). And he thinks that some degree of originality may be claimed for this attempt. " The easiest and most natural way to account for our be- lief that we do sometimes at least make genuine logical judgments, as distinguished from compositions of representations, is to suppose that our belief corresponds to the fact, that genuine judgments such as 7+5 I2 occur as dated events in the experience of some men" (ibid.). This the author denies by roundly asserting that "nobody ever has judged 7+5= =2 or ever will." If this means what I understand it to mean, I can only baldly say that it strikes me as wholly perverse since it undermines the entire superstructure of sci- ence. And so far from its being original, I should suppose that it leads back beyond the whole sweep of modern thought and the best of Greek thought to that type of naive sensationalism which at one time threatened to play havoc with Greek speculation. In this remark I am speaking of the above quotations and not of the paper as a whole, which, I must frankly confess, I follow (if at all) only afar off. But these quotations, the author assures us, contain the burden of his message. E. S. Russell's paper on " Psychobiology " makes the rather startling claim that biology cannot yet be said to be an independent science with a method and concepts of its own. And the claim is further made and argued that it cannot become such a science until it definitely aban- dons the mechanistic view of life and frankly adopts the psychological view-the view, that is, which looks upon the living thing as respond- ing to a perceived situation. " We take as fundamental and unanalyz- able into factors of another order the general relation, perception- conative or hormic impulse-action. Each term of this relation, and the whole relation itself, must be regarded as simple and indivisible, as having real synthetic unity or undividedness " (p. I47). This view, stated in philosophical terms, is the monadistic view. And the author holds that it " can be applied with success to the problems of biology both in the study of behavior and in the study of morpho- genesis, and that it forms the only real alternative to the mechanistic formulation " (p. I55). How Professor Russell's fellow-biologists will accept his suggestion remains for them to determine; I can im- agine that for the majority of them, at any rate, it will seem to be a</page><page sequence="5">No. I.] REVIEWS OF BOOKS. IO1 counsel to return to the crude anthropomorphism from which biology particularly has with difficulty freed itself. From the philosophical point of view the suggestion is interesting in that it takes seriously the claims of the higher forms and insists upon their uniqueness; its main difficulty, perhaps, is to be sought in the question whether it does not take those claims too seriously and give them too comprehensive a sway. Roy Wood Sellars ("The Double-Knowledge Approach to the Mind-Body Problem") undertakes to rid the mind-body problem of the dualistic implications that have persistently clung to it and to de- fend a naturalistic solution of it. Consciousness is but the 'qualita- tive dimensions' of the cerebral system; " mental operations are opera- tions of the brain" (p. 69); the physical and the psychical are " in- separable characters of the brain-mind " (p. 67). The two kinds of knowledge whose recognition makes this solution possible are: the one which "arises in the 'filling' of the brain and inspects quales there present," and the one which "deciphers the characteristics of the brain as a body by means of the cognitive value of certain sense- data" (p. 59). How the first arises in the 'filling' of the brain, whether in this regard it is intrinsically different from the second, and how it is to be distinguished from the time-honored 'introspection '- none of these things are made clear. Nor is it anywhere clearly stated how this naturalistic solution of the problem is fundamentally differ- ent from several others that by some are labelled idealistic. And it certainly seems historically questionably to say of all idealists indis- criminately that in their consideration of the problem "they do not take the physical world and its categories seriously" (p. 55). W. Adams Brown, in his discussion of " The Problem of Classification in Religion," undertakes to make a classification of religious types on the basis of man's attitude towards society with the result that he dis- tinguishes three basal types: imperialism, individualism, and democ- racy. This classification is quite suggestive, and, for many purposes at least, it is an improvement over the conventional ones. Those who are prone to grow excited at the mention of the 'unconscious' should not fail to read C. D. Broad's excellent paper on "Various Meanings of the Term 'Unconscious."' Six meanings of the term are dis- covered, only one of which is in the least exciting; and with reference to it the question is very justly raised whether there be any facts to which the term in this meaning may fairly be applied, or whether all bona fide facts may not be subsumed under the other more prosaic meanings.</page><page sequence="6">102 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXXIV. The remaining papers of this volume are as follows: "A New Theory of Matter," by Leslie J. Walker; "Primary and Secondary Consciousness," by May Sinclair; " The Problem of Free Will in the Light of Recent Developments in Philosophy," by C. E. M. Joad; " Discussion of Dr. Wildon Carr's A Theory of Monads," by Hilda D. Oakeley; "Some Problems in the Philosophy of Leibnitz," by L. J. Russell; "The Contact of Minds," by C. Delisle Burns; "What Does Dr. Whitehead Mean by 'Event'?" by W. Leslie MacKenzie; and " The Category of Purpose in Social Science," by Morris Gins- berg. There are many interesting points raised in these papers, and I regret that limitations of space render comments impossible. The volume concludes with a paper by H. Wildon Carr entitled " In Me- moriam: Bernard Bosanquet. Some Personal Recollections." This paper includes a complete list of the papers written by Professor Bosanquet for the meetings of the Aristotelian Society. Supplementary Volume III is composed of those papers and sym- posia (two papers, and five symposia) which constituted the programs of the joint session of the Aristotelian Society, the Mind Association, and the Scots Philosophical Club held at Durham, July i3-i6, 1923. The symposium on " The Relations Between Biology and Psychol- ogy " traverses familiar ground. J. S. Haldane's opening paper fol- lows the general line of argument set forth in his other writings on the subject and ends with the conclusion that the relation of psychol- ogy to biology is the relation of a less abstract or partial form of knowledge to a more abstract form. E. S. Russell's contribution is in essential agreement with Professor Haldane's thesis, though his predilection for the psychobiological point of view advocated in his paper in the Proceedings (see above) seems to impel him to carry psychological analysis farther down into biological inquiries than Professor Haldane would apparently be willing to admit is feasible. W. Leslie MacKenzie is, at least by indirection, the advocate in the debate of the claims of mechanistic explanation (at any rate in biology; he says little about psychology) his paper being devoted pri- marily to the presentation of difficulties which he discerns in Professor Haldane's position. So far as I can see, nothing new is brought out by this discussion. The perennial opposition between the mechanistic and anti-mechanistic arguments is once again exemplified. On the one side it is contended that the phenomena of life and mind are intrinsically such that they cannot be adequately explained in terms of physical categories, and that each set of phenomena can be described only by those categories appropriate to its nature. On the other side the</page><page sequence="7">No. I.] REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 103 mechanistic method is assumed to be the only 'scientific' method for dealing with these phenomena and the question is raised whether the fact that these phenomena have hitherto somehow apparently fallen beyond the limits of this method is any valid reason for holding that they always will. With reference to the matter I can here only sug- gest this query: Is it not the case that truth lies on both sides; that some day, perchance, mental and vital phenomena may -be duly made subject to the method of mechanical analysis; but that, when this day arrives, the method of such analysis will be seen to have become less 'mechanistic' and matter will be observed to have grown less 'ma- terial?' Meanwhile, it is clearly dogmatic to hold that life is nothing more than mere atoms or that mind is to be identified with integrations of neurones. The two symposia on the 'new' idealism are racy discussions. To the question, "Is Neo-Idealism Reducible to Solipsism?" three an- swers are defended. C. E. M. Joad answers in the affirmative and without qualifications. C. A. Richardson gives a more guarded an. swer. Neo-idealism, he contends, may be reduced to solipsism but it is as capable of defending itself against solipsistic interpretation as is any other philosophy; the truth of the matter, he avers, is that the premises of neo-idealism imply neither the truth nor the falsity of solipsism and that "all other philosophical theories are in precisely the same case." F. C. S. Schiller agrees that neo-idealism, and all idealisms, are open to solipsistic interpretation; and the same is true, though not so obviously true, of realism. But he hopes to save at least his type of pragmatism from Professor Richardson's generaliza- tion, reiterating his conviction (see Humanism, Chapter XIV) that humanism stands logically secure here. Professor Joad's position seems to the reviewer to come most nearly to the heart of the matter so far as the precise question in debate is concerned; in what seems the most natural interpretation of its main premises, neo-idealism ap- pears to lead directly towards solipsism, and Croce's efforts to escape it do not obviously stand foursquare with his premises. I do not see, however, that Professor Richardson is justified in his assertion that any and every philosophical theory may be said to imply solip- sism at least in the sense that it does not imply its falsity; if I am not mistaken, this assertion rests upon the very questionable assumption that all philosophizing must seek its certainty in a subjectivistic in- dividualism like that implied in Descartes' famous axiom. Against any such assumption as this Professor Schiller's remarks are decidedly</page><page sequence="8">I04 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXXIV. pertinent, but I see no reason why he should suppose that the prag- matist alone has a right to appeal to them. The symposium by Evelyn Underhill, R. G. Collingwood, and W. R. Inge on the question, " Can the New Idealism Dispense with Mysticism? " apparently turns on the question as to what precisely is to be understood by the slippery term 'mysticism' and the equally slippery term 'new idealism.' Miss Underhill insists that the 'new idealism' cannot dispense with those values and experiences that are commonly called mystical, in spite of the fact that it strives to do so. Professor Collingwood accuses her of having failed to understand what the 'new idealism' really is, and argues that a correct inter- pretation of this point of view will disclose the fact that it includes everything of value for which the mystic has contended. Dean Inge is not sure whether the interpretation of the 'new idealism' offered by Professor Collingwood is correct, though he is inclined to suspect that it is not. In any event, he is certain that Professor Collingwood has read out of mysticism whatever of significance it possesses and has left it a mere shell robbed of content which one may or may not dispense with at pleasure. " My conclusion is," he tersely remarks at the end of his paper, "not that the new Idealism can or cannot dis- pense with Mysticism, but that Mysticism can very well dispense with it." This symposium exemplifies in a marked manner the important r6le which language inevitably plays in the debates of philosophers. Not infrequently, it appears, we dispute about terms; but, after all, terms are decidedly worth disputing about, provided only the debate does not resolve itself into mere logomachy. This review has already transgressed the limits of the space at the writer's disposal and it must therefore be brought to a close. The two remaining symposia are, in many respects, the best in the volume and deserve detailed study; they are quite closely reasoned and hardly lend themselves to a summary treatment. Whoever is interested in the problems with which they deal will find great wealth of sugges- tion in the two sets of papers. One is on " The Problem of Simul- taneity: Is There a Paradox in the Principle of Relativity in Regard to the Relation of Time Measured to Time Lived?" and the papers are by H. Wildon Carr, R. A. Sampson, and A. N. Whitehead. The other is on the question, " Are the Characteristics of Particular Things Universal or Particular? " and the contributors are: G. E. Moore, G. F. Stout, and G. Dawes Hicks. This is one of the most stimulating discussions of one aspect of the problem of universals with which I happen to be acquainted.</page><page sequence="9">No. i.] REVIEWS OF BOOKS.
