[MARCH, &amp;quot; that our predecessors have said, we ac300t with joy and grati tude; as to the errors which they may have committed, we notice them in order that they may be avoided even while we excuse them.&amp;quot; In this viewpoint, which is free at once from servilit v and from presumption, we have/the key to Ibn Rushd&amp;apos;s whole philosophic outlook. It was here that he differed most pro foundly from al-Ghazali. This latter was a kind of Hume turned mystic; he had passed through all the stages of s300 ticism to end in fanatical sufism. Like many another such convert, al-Ghazali was inclined to forget his own debt to his pre mystic teachers, against whom he so gaily tilted. Ibn Rushd administered him a well-deserved rebuke :1 &amp;quot; Whatever is best and most important in Ghazali&amp;apos;s work is taken from the writings and teachings, of the philosophers. Although these latter fell into errors, still the excellence of their achievement should not be denied even if they had done nothing but perfect the science of logic. Ghazali himself admits the abso lute necessity of the Greek logic for the knowledge of truth, and tries to deduce their teachings from the Qur&amp;apos;an. A man who, like Ghazali, has learnt so much from the writings and teachings of the philosophers that his name has become great in Islam, ought not to adopt the tone that he does even though we grant that they erred in metaKelphysical matters. No one is infallible ex300t by such supernatural as sur asses human nature which &amp;apos; ivp p is given only to the prophets.&amp;quot; The significance of this diversity lies in the fact that it was not merely a personal dispute between Ibn Rushd and Ghazali. Rather was it the battle of two divergent world-views, the struggle of the Aryan against the Semitic. The question at issue was whether Islam could assimilate Greek speculation. The very title of al-Ghazali&amp;apos;s work Taha f ut al-Falasi f ah, &amp;quot; The Self-contradiction of the Philosophers &amp;quot;-reveals his uncom promising rejection of Greek thought. The word falasifah (philosophers), it must be noted, was applied exclusively to the Arabian peripatetics, who always remained a small body quite alien to the national life. Indeed, ex300t al-Kindi, they were all either Persians or Spaniards. Against this imported falsafa then, and not against philosophy as such (which he allowed within limits), Ghazali directed his attack. It would be quite a mistake to regard Ghazali as innocent of any philosophy. He defended natural knowledge against his I Tahaf rat, pp. 221 f, Horten.</page><page sequence="4">1914.3 Averroism and Scholasticism. 689 more intransigent co-religionists He even defended several theses of the philosophers (e.g., definition and classification of the passions, the principle ex uno non fit nisi uninn, certain views on the resurrection and on miracles, the proof of the existence of a First Cause, etc.). Also he shared many views of the inutakalIimin or conservative Muslim theologians; for instance, he was what we should now call an occasionalist, he regarded God as sole creative and efficient cause. In fact, the mnutakallinz in held that not only were all acts but also their qualifications (even moral values were due to decrees of God&amp;apos;s absolute will. Altogether one would imagine that these nzutakallinzin, whom Ibn Rushd so effectively refuted, would be rather doubtful allies for a Christian philosopher. Pere Alandonnet, however, has been inadvertently led into such an alliance. &amp;quot; Averroes [he writes, i. 148], being severely taken to task by the representatives of religious authority, became aggressive in his turn against the teaching of the great 600otheist religions. The anony mous author of the de erroribus philosophorum refers with strong disapproval to this attitude of Averroes, as well as to the epithets which he applies to the theologians, who are, in his eyes, loquentes, garrulatores and voluntates, i.e., people who speak without reason or with prejudice. Siger does not go this far, at least in the ex pression of his thought.&amp;quot; Unfortunately, this criticism is a tissue of misunder standings. The only &amp;quot; representative of religious authority &amp;quot; in Islam is ijma, the agreement of the Muslim people (the consensus ecciesice, as we might say ; neither khalif nor theolo? gian can authoritatively settle a dispute. In the next place, Averroes admits the truth of all 600otheistic religions, as I shall show presently. Finally, the anonymous schoolman who took umbrage at the expression &amp;quot;loquentes&amp;quot; &amp;quot; has been misled by the Latin translation. Even if it were an epithet of mild abuse, it should not count too heavily against the much-abused Averroes; for the &amp;quot; theologians &amp;quot; against whom he was writing were a set of narrow and intolerant bigots with no more pre tensions to represent religion than Averroes himself. But, as a matter of fact, loquentes is merely an uncouth rendering of the I Cf. D. Kauffmann, Gesch. der Attributenlehre in der dlteren jiidischen Religaonsphilosophie.

Kalam originally meant a word of speech, but came to mean dialectics (especially theological ; hence mnutakallimiu meant dialecticians, and in later times was used to designate the conservative theologians of Islam. It was even applied to Christian and Jewish theologians; thus Ibn Rushd speaks of &amp;quot; the mutakallimin of the three religions &amp;quot; (loquentes trium legum), and Moses ben Maimun applies it to Christians.&amp;apos; The &amp;quot;aggressiveness&amp;quot; &amp;quot; of Averroes would thus seem due to Mandonnet&amp;apos;s defective exegesis; and it may be as well to remark here that the same is true of Siger. &amp;quot; We cannot fail to recog nise,&amp;quot; we are told (i. 193), &amp;quot; that under cover of his usual restric tions Siger himself went too far. Thus in his de aeternnitate mundi he places the theologians beside the poets because both admit the fable of the creation.&amp;quot; This is certainly a surprising charge against a Christian philosopher; it is still more sur prising to find that there is no foundation for it. When we turn to the passage of Siger (ii. 139), we find : (x the expression &amp;quot;fable of creation &amp;quot; does not occur at all, (2 the passage is a citation from Aristotle,2 (3 it occurs in an objection which is correctly answered two pages further on (ii. 141), and (4 there is no mention at all of &amp;quot;poets and theologians, &amp;quot; but only of &amp;quot; theologising poets.&amp;quot;3 Really, the only difficulty in dis cussing the Averroisrn of Siger is to find a trace of it either in Averroes or in Siger. Although the view that Siger was really a freethinker and impostor is still prevalent, there is a growing consensus of opinion that Ibn Rushd was at least subjectively honest and at heart a true Muslim.

I may note also that St. Thomas (CG. 3 97, Frette, xu., 385 b mentions: Error loquentium in lege Sara cenorum, ut Rabbi Moyses dicit. The Latin version of Ghazali also uses loquentes (DD., p. 338 b).

For instance, Prof. Macdonald writes : 3 &amp;quot; His philosophy left no place in reality for a system of rewards and punishments, or even for any individual existence of the soul after death, for a creation of the material world, or for a provi dence in the direct working of the supreme being on earth. But all these points are involved or glossed over in these tractates.&amp;quot; That Ibn Rushd &amp;quot; involved or glossed over &amp;quot; his rationalism in order to hoodwink the orthodox, there is not a shred of evidence. Even so severe a critic as Father Manser4 admits that &amp;quot; there is not a single passage in which Averroes attacks the religion of the Quran as such.&amp;quot; This being so, it seems hardly necessary to defend his good faith, since his writings are the only evidence of his opinions. Moreover, if we may judge from several incidental statements, there is positive proof that he abhorred duplicity. Thus, in dealing with some dialectical shuffling of al-Ghazali, he remarks :5 &amp;quot; Ghazali is above this sort of thing. But perhaps his contemporaries persuaded him to publish this book in order to clear himself from the suspicion that he held the view of the philosophers.&amp;quot; And, indeed, evidence is not at all wanting that Ghazali truckled to the prejudices of the mob.6 However this may be, there is no question of attributing to al-Ghazali (or to his great protagonist any real infidelity to the creed of Islam. But it may well be that he practised economy in the expression of his real views; his disbelief in philosophy may not have been as intense as it seems. Even if this be admitted, the fact remains that it was the narrow conservatism expressed in al-Ghazali&amp;apos;s writings and by his truculent obscurantist devotees that Ibn Rushd opposed, and not &amp;quot;theology&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;theologians.&amp;quot; One need not be a rationalist to be dissatisfied with the following dubious recogni tion of philosophy.7 x See Manser, Jahrb. fur Philos. and seek.

[NIARCHI &amp;quot;The testi600ies of the Quran and man&amp;apos;s innate religious sen timent excuse us from formulating an apodictic de600stration of God&amp;apos;s existence. However, by way of confirmation, and to follow the example of philosophers, we shall start from first principles, as follows . . . .&amp;quot; &amp;quot; I intend to show,&amp;quot; al-Ghazali writes in his Tahafut,l that the Peripatetics are incapable of proving cogently by the sole force of reason that the soul is a spiritual subsistent sub stance.&amp;quot; His sole object is &amp;quot; the destruction of the falasifah.&amp;quot; He himself belongs to &amp;quot;a school which gives credence to the Prophet&amp;apos;s truth founded on his miracles; which in the strictly philosophical order confines itself to admitting only the existence of the Lord who sent the prophets; which refrains from inquiring any further by reason into the attributes of this Lord; which in this subject admits exclusively the teachings of the author of revelation [Muhammad]; which scrupulously imitates his terminology, i.e., the use of the numbers of divine attributes employed by him, and avoids all interpretation of them in any sense different from that permitted by revelation; and which finally recognises and confesses that it is incapable of perceiving the true essence of God and of His attributes.&amp;quot; 2 Even the conservative Main is rejected. &amp;quot;The arguments of the Quran,&amp;quot; he writes,3 &amp;quot; are like food which is useful for all men. The arguments of the nzutakalliinin are like drugs: useful for some, harmful for most people.&amp;quot; Back to Muhammad !&amp;quot; was the cry of al-Ghazali; and, unfortunately for Islam, it has heard him. His ideal of the golden age which he advocated may best be given in his own words :4 &amp;quot; The Companions of the Prophet were engaged in polemic with the Jews and Christians in order to defend the divine mission of Muhammad and the truth of the resurrection against those who denied it. To defend these dogmas (which are the principal articles of the Islamic creed), they merely employed the proofs of the Quran. After that they received into Islam those who pro f essed themselves satisfied with these proofs; and those who were not convinced they condemned to death. They did not divert themselves in presenting further rational proofs nor in piling up syllogisms (each premiss being dwelt upon according to the dialectical method), much less did they ever descend to discuss the system of their adversaries.

The method of the ancients consists in refraining from an examination, in not replying to questions concerning faith, in entrusting their solution to the lash, the whip, and the sword. This method is adapted to the majority, though not to the minority of men. So we see that infidels being reduced to servitude become Musalmans under the menace of the sword; and, after thus living for some time, their conversion, which began by being violent, i becomes voluntary, and by faith turns into certainty what origin ally was doubt and perplexity. This transformation is effected by living and dealing familiarly with Muslims, hearing the word of God, witnessing the examples of the saints, listening to the narra tion of heroic deeds, and by other circumstances of this kind, which prepare the hearts of infidels much better than dialectic and rational proofs.&amp;quot; It has been necessary to cite al-Ghazali at some length, because it is very important to realise clearly the particular theological system which Ibn Rushd attacked, or rather the par ticular attack against which he. defended philosophy. He held that Muhammad had not for ever quenched all speculative yearnings of mankind, he thought that a Muslim could learn something from a heathen or a Christian, he believed that Islam could assimilate all that was best in Hellenic thought. Non tali azcxiiio nec def ensori bus istis was the reply of Islam: failure is writ large over every attempt to infuse Islam with culture and progress. In spite of the freethinking inutazilites, in spite of the enlightened f alasi f alv, in spite of al-Mamun and the other Abbasid khalifs, in spite even of contact with European civilisa tion, the typical Muslim has remained in the slough of ignorant and superstitious bigotry. One of the most striking results of Islam&amp;apos;s rejection of Greek thought was the sharp cleavage between the literati and the people. The formation of an intellectual coterie is indeed one of the effects of every .A2c f klarung, and in the present instance there were special reasons. Neoplatonist and Gnostic esotericism had struck deep roots in the East, or rather it was itself the result of some innate trait of the Semitic mind. Even in New Testa ment times we meet in Palestine the freethinking Sad ducees (zaddukinz), and the conservative Pharisees (perushim, &amp;quot;separated ones &amp;quot;), both despising and disdaining the vulgar throng (ain ha-arets, &amp;quot; country people &amp;quot;), who knew not the law. In Islam we find a curious triple division. First there was the</page><page sequence="9">694 Studies. [MARCH, elite (khawass : &amp;quot; men of de600stration &amp;quot; (burhaiz), who could look at the naked truth, and whose belief was based on first principles (awwaliyat). The next class consisted of &amp;quot; men of dialectic,&amp;quot; who possessed a certain amount of speculative insight and whose belief was based on probable or controversial argu ments (jadliya). The third and most numerous class was com posed of the &amp;quot; men of exhortation,&amp;quot; the vulgar crowd (awamm), amenable only to rhetorical arguments (khitabiya), generally based on authoritative dicta (maqbulat). To elucidate this exoteric class, Ibn Rushd cites a tradition (hadits).&amp;apos; One day the Prophet asked a negress (a slave and a convert to Islam): &amp;quot;Where is God ?&amp;quot; &amp;quot; Up in heaven,&amp;quot; she replied. The Prophet was pleased with the answer, and at once ordered her liberation; because, adds Ibn Rushd, she did not belong to &amp;quot; the people of de600stration.&amp;quot; If she did, she should presumably have answered: &amp;quot; God is nowhere; it would be truer to say everywhere is in God.&amp;quot; And if she had been in the dialectical class, she might have replied: &amp;quot; God is everywhere.&amp;quot; It must not be imagined that this threefold gradation was invented by Ibn Rushd. It is found quite clearly in Ibn Tufail (Abubacer), and is equally ac300ted by al-Ghazali and by Moses ben Maimun (Mai600ides). It would seem, in fact, to be a com promise. On the one hand, the traditionalists admitted the right to philosophise, provided philosophy was confined to an intellectual elite. And on the other hand, the progressivists, secure of their own right of sanctuary, were glad to abandon all efforts to instruct the populace. Ghazali, for instance, concedes reasonably enough that &amp;quot; God does not forbid all men indis criminately to inquire into and to study what He commands, but only those of weak intelligence who are incapable of under standing the difficulties of rational de600stration.&amp;quot;2 &amp;quot;It is forbidden,&amp;quot; writes Ibn Rushd, &amp;quot;to discuss or write about theology. For the intelligence of the many does not reach to such depths, and to dispute with them on this matter destroys their religion. Hence such a theological disputation with them is prohibited, since it is sufficient for their happiness that in this subject they should understand what their understanding can perceive.&amp;quot; It would seem, then, that there was a practical unanimity as to the restriction of philosophical speculation.

Did he ac300t it as an absolute standard of truth, or did lie merely use it as a sop for the simple The first objection to Ibn Rushd&amp;apos;s ac300tance of the Quran is his alleged religious indifferentism. According to an anonymous schoolman, one of the errors of the Commentator is the thesis, &amp;quot; nulla lex est vera, licet possit esse utilis. &amp;quot;&amp;quot; There is, at first sight, some ground for this charge, since Ibn Rushd speaks constantly of religions (in the plural). These, however, were not all equally true. &amp;quot; The philosopher [he writes3 must choose for himself the best religion of his time, although all religions are true in his eyes; for he must believe that the best abrogates the others. This is why the [Christian philosophers who taught at Alexandria became Musalmans when the religion of Islam reached them, and the philosophers who taught in Rome and Byzantium became Chris- tians when the religion of Jesus (may he be blessed! was brought to them.&amp;quot; Ibn Rushd, then, admitted the truth of Judaism and Chris tianity, but it is also quite clear that he upheld the superiority of Islam. There is nothing very original in this; it is simply the view of Muhammad himself !4 And it is an eminently Christian thought: one which recalls the noble tribute of Paul to the sacred shrines of Athens (Acts 1723). The modern tendency to transform the transcendence of the true religion into an exclusive possession of all truth and an absolute opposition to other cults is simply an unconscious relic of Baianism.

LMARCHS rate, can hardly be accused of being indifferent to Islam. He holds that the Muslim devotional pre300ts are the best: &amp;quot; In the eyes of the prophets the most praiseworthy [religious principle is that which best excites the com600 people to virtuous actions, so that those who are brought up according to this prin ciple arrive at greater virtue than others. Such, for instance, are prayers a600g us [Muslims]. For there is no doubt that prayer keeps men from evil actions; and the prayer prescribed in this religion is fitted to produce this effect more perfectly than the prayers of other religions; this is due to the fixed \numbers and times and formulae and to the other conditions of purification and of c abstention from incompatible acts and words.&amp;quot; x Still stronger is the following &amp;quot; Ghazali accuses the falasifah of denying the miracle of Abra ham&amp;apos;s not burning in the fire. But it was only the Muslim heretics who denied this. It is not allowed to the falasifah to discuss the principles of revelation. If any of them were to do so, he ought to be severely punished. . . . It is the duty of every man to ac300t the principles of the Law and to acknowledge the authority of the lawgiver. To deny or to discuss these principles is to destroy man&amp;apos;s existence. Hence heretics should be killed.&amp;apos;2 There is no uncertain sound about this last. The Muslim unbeliever (ziitdiq receives short shrift from this Muslim judge (qadi). Not even a philosopher might dare to call in question the miracle of Abraham which, after all, is but a legend (due to a misinterpretation of &amp;quot; Ur of the Chaldees &amp;quot; as &amp;quot; the fire of the Chaldees &amp;quot; embodied in the Quran. Certainly it requires some ingenuity to detect irreligion or rationalism here I It simply never occurred to Ibn Rushd that the cultured and philo sophical &amp;quot; men of de600stration &amp;quot; could dispense with religion. The following quotation leaves no room for doubt; it is (as we might say a powerful plea for the indispensibility of &amp;quot;the penny catechism &amp;quot; even for a learned man. &amp;quot;Religions tend to the same end as philosophy, but by a universally accessible way; and thus they are binding upon all. For philosophy brings happiness only to a portion of mankind to those who are occupied in philosophic study; while religions aim at the instruction of all men without ex300tion. Now, since the existence and happiness of the learned is attainable only in com munity with the people, the instruction intended primarily for the unlettered is also necessary for the existence and happiness of the learned.

If he divulges a difficulty or even an interpretation concerning the religious principles in which he has been educated, he is destroying [the work of the prophets-on whom be God&amp;apos;s benison Thus he, most of all men, deserves the name of infidel and the punishment which, according to the religion in which he has been educated, is due to such infidelity.&amp;quot; So far, we have not met with any suggestion that possibly the falsafa and the Quran may not be in agreement. Indeed, the very idea of such a possible discrepancy may never have occurred to Ibn Rushd. If anywhere, we should expect to find it in his &amp;quot; Har600y of Religion and Philosophy.&amp;quot; But this is how he begins: &amp;quot; My object in this treatise is to examine, from the standpoint of religious speculation, if the study of philosophy and of the logical sciences is permitted or forbidden by the religious Law, or if it is prescribed as a matter of merit or of obligation. It will be noticed that his inquiry is not, as we should expect, Are the results of faith and philosophy in conflict His inquiry is rather: Does faith allow or forbid philosophical speculation The very terms in which the problem presented itself to Ibn Rushd&amp;apos;s mind reveal how completely he ac300ted the Quran as supreme arbiter. &amp;quot;Such a discussion,&amp;quot; he writes elsewhere,3 &amp;quot;is permissible in this book; were it not so, we should never hold that it was licit, for it would be either express infidelity or some thing to be deplored and punished.&amp;quot; Hence he is at great pains to prove that the religious law allows and even prescribes specu lation. It must be confessed that the Quranic texts4 have to be a little strained for this purpose; but this was a general fault of Muslim hermeneutics so much had to be read into the poetical and opportunist Prophet I The main thing to observe is that Ibn Rushd justifies philosophy from the Quran. Furthermore, there is some truth in Horten&amp;apos;s complaints that &amp;quot; his whole ten dency is to follow the Quran, and to allow his philosophical thinking to be determined by it; we receive the same unfavour able impression if we analyse the actual thoughts of his proof&amp;quot; of God&amp;apos;s unity. 3 Ibid., p. 279, Horten; Gauthier, La theorie, pp. &amp;quot;s, 3, 121 ; DD., p. 351 e.

[MARCH, It seems hardly likely then that he was conscious of a con tradiction between Quran and philosophy, for, as he says,&amp;apos; &amp;quot;truth never contradicts itself; it har600ises with itself and bears witness to itself.&amp;quot; The same thought is found even in his commentaries : -- &amp;quot; Et cum omnia ista lint, ideo visum est mihi scribere quod videtur mihi in hoc. et si hoc quod apparet mihi non fuerit com pletum, erit principium complementi. et tunc rogo fratresrvidentes hoc scriptum scribere suas dubitationes; et forte per illud in venietur verum in hoc, si nondum inveni; et si inveni (ut fingo), tunc declarabitur per illas quaestiones. veritas epim, ut dicit Aristoteles, convenit et testatur sibi omni modo.&amp;quot;2 It would be hard to beat this last passage, so modest in its claims, and yet so unshaken in its belief in the triumph of truth. This confidence in the unity of knowledge was, however, no 600opoly of Ibn Rushd. It seems to have been a first principle with Muslim thinkers. Hence their passionate quest for the reconciliation of Plato and Aristotle and Plotinos. Hence, too, the disconcerting naivete with which Platonic Ideas, Aristotelian spheres, and Plotinian emanations played together in Mu hammad&amp;apos;s seven-storied heaven. Only thus also can we explain how those strange creations of Muslim eschatology the Pen, the Tablet, the Bridge, the Throne-mingle so oddly with the Peripatetic Nous and the Christian Angels. But Averroes does not live in this Arabian Night; he belongs to a more critical age. The unity of truth in which he believed was not the apotheosised jumble of the I h hwan al-Safa a (the Pure or Faithful Brethren of al-Basra, but rather a critical and completed Aristotelianism. Hence he could not crudely ac300t Hellenism and Quranism, reconciling their contradictions in sufic ecstasy; his was no mystic system of intuitionism, but rather a painstaking detailed empiricism. Accordingly, his conviction of the unity of truth could not dispense him from a careful investigation of the diffi culties involved in the Quran. In explaining the Quranic anthropomorphisms, Ibn Rushd employed the principle of &amp;quot;interpretation &amp;quot; which all en lightened Musalmans agreed in ac300ting. Muslim theologians had found it necessary to distinguish an outer or apparent sense (dahir), and an inner or hidden sense (batin); and they resorted to interpretation (tawil when the literal sense caused difficulties. 1 Fasl al.magal, p. 26, Gauthier. s 3 de an. 5; Opera (1560), vol. 7, p, 101 a,</page><page sequence="14">1914.E Averroism and Scholasticism. 699 This principle was universally admitted, though the various schools differed very considerably in its application. The Asharites, for instance, &amp;quot; interpreted &amp;quot; traditions and Quranic verses which the Hachwiyya took literally. Also there were &amp;quot; interiorists &amp;quot; (batiniyya and sufis who made an extravagant and arbitrary use of allegorical interpretation, just as the Origenists did in the Christian Church. But Ibn Rushd expressly repudiated these extremists, and laid down canons for a saner exegesis. &amp;quot;To interpret,&amp;quot; he says,&amp;apos; &amp;quot; is to make the meaning pass from the literal to the figurative sense, without doing violence to the custom of the Arabic language of naming something to designate metaphorically its similar or its cause or its consequence or its concomitant, and of employing any metaphor com600ly included a600g the figures of speech.&amp;quot; Hence, interpretation of the Quran must be suited to the genius of the Arab mind and language. Furthermore, men of the exoteric class, &amp;quot; men of exhortation,&amp;quot; should not try to interpret at all; they are capable only of grasping the exterior sense and interpretation on their part would be heresy and infidelity. This, of course, does not mean that they are confined to an absurd literalism. For there are certain fundamental religious truths (such as God&amp;apos;s existence, the mission of prophets, beatitude or torments in a future life), which are accessible to all, and are never wrapped in symbols. In fact, there are many texts which must be ac300ted by all (even the philosophers in their literal sense.2 Another principle he lays down is this: no one can go against the unanimous exegesis of the Musalman doctors of an epoch.8 Finally, he emphatically asserts that the philosophical interpretation of a text should never deny the existence of what is stated in the text (e.g., future life), but should refer only to its manner of being.&amp;apos; Such in brief outline are some of the safeguards and criteria which Ibn Rushd applies to the allegorical interpretation of the Quran. It is now necessary to examine some of the charges which have been directed against his exegesis. I shall begin with Pere Mandonnet&amp;apos;s indictment [i. pp. 149f., note : &amp;quot;Having arrived at the critical point of this theory of the har 600y of faith and science, Averroes examines the case (which alone matters in which the teaching of the revealed text is in conflict Fasl a[-magal, p 26, Gauthier. 2Ibid., pp. 36 f. 3 Ibid , p. 28. &amp;apos;Ibid., p. 39. 3A2</page><page sequence="15">700 Studies. [MARCH, with science. He declares unequivocally that we ought to give a metaphorical interpretation to the revealed text which is equivalent to saying that we must reject its value while appearing to preserve it. &amp;apos;Every revealed text whose literal sense contradicts a truth apodictically proved, must be interpreted allegorically.&amp;apos;1 Hence the revealed text is recognised as capable of being formally in contradiction with [truth of the philosophical order. And that there may be no misunderstanding of his real thought, Averroes is careful to tell us that this interpretation ought to be entirely withdrawn from the knowledge of the ignorant crowd who are unable to penetrate this hidden sense.&amp;quot; It is difficult to seize the exact point of this criticism. The charge of esotericism may be dismissed at the outset; as I have already shown that al-Ghazali and the other I1uslim teachers agreed in keeping philosophical interpretation from the vulgar. It may be worth while, however, to note that there are elements of truth in this disciplina arcani. Muhammadanism was essen? .tially the religion of the unlettered children of the desert. &amp;quot; Islam is built upon five things,&amp;quot; says a tradition of the Prophet,2 &amp;quot; testi600y that there is no god but God and that Muhammad is the Apostle of God, Prayer (salat), the Poor-rate (zakat), Pilgrimage (hajj), and Fast (sawn in Ramadan.&amp;quot; The same spirit of practical piety is well expressed by al-Ghazali :3 &amp;quot; Knowledge is like a tree whose fruit is practice. Although a man spent a hundred years in the study of the sciences and accumulated thousands of books, he could not obtain the mercy of the Highest without good works. This is the only means avail- able to man. The servant who hopes to meet his master is careful to work with all perfection, for he knows well that only those that so work will enter into paradise, where nothing will be wanting to them.&amp;quot; [Quran 1961]. Surely this might have been written by Thomas a Kempis. It may serve to remind us that Christianity, too, is the religion of the poor and the lowly. And is not the Index of Prohibited Books a standing justification of the basic principle of Ibn Rushd&amp;apos;s esotericism Pere Mandonnet seems further to object to the principle that &amp;quot;every revealed text whose literal sense contradicts a truth apodictically proved, must be interpreted allegorically.&amp;quot; He concludes that this principle recognises the possibility of a con tradiction between the revealed text [he should have said: the I Asin, El Averroismo, pp. 295 f. 2 k1-Shahrastani, p. 27, Cureton; trans.

There seems nothing very shocking in this conclusion. Has he not heard of the days of creation, God&amp;apos;s walking in paradise, His anger, His face, His throne It is to suchlike expressions, which also occur in the Quran, that Ibn Rushd is referring. There was special need for emphasising rational interpreta tion in the case of the Quran. For, unlike the Bible, the Quran is believed to be a direct and immediate revelation dictated by God Himself. The complete book descended from God on &amp;quot; the night of power &amp;quot; ; but, happily for Muhammad, its descent was arrested at the lowest of the seven heavens. There it remained treasured up, portion after portion being &amp;quot;delivered delivered in parcels through the Angel Gabriel &amp;quot; [Quran 2534], according as succes sive declarations of doctrine, law or policy became needed. This view of the Quran as the Word of God (Kalam Allah led to an extravagant literalism which has frozen Muslim thought even to the present day. Many fanatics went so far as to hold that the actual book was uncreated, and had existed with God from all eternity.i Without going so far, the orthodox sects (such as the Karramites indulged in the crassest anthropomorphic reading of the Quran---God has a body, actually sits on a throne, etc. Perhaps the most curious creations of Muslim thought are the details of the Quranic eschatology; such as the Balance (inizan for weighing the leaves of the good and bad deeds, the Bridge (al-sirat sharper than a sword and finer than a hair over which the believers crossed hell, the Tank (bawd from which they drink before entering the Garden.2 Al-Ghazali felt embar rassed by these objects of Muslim eschatology.3 He did not wish to allegorise or to dematerialise them completely, though at times he interprets the Bridge, for instance, as the path of the just man between two vicious extremes. So he tried to com promise by holding that the Tablet, the Pen, the Balance, etc., are actual entities; their existence, however, he relegated to a supercelestial eternal world (clam al-malakid). In spite of this futile attempt to reconcile rational philosophy with the incurable tendency of the Arab mind to personalise and hypostasise its dreams, al-Ghazali is quite explicit in upholding 1 This doctrine is clearly derived from the Christian Logos of the Greek Church. The Quran, in fact, became a kind of Muslim parody of the Incarna tion. 2 See Baron Carra de Vaux, Fragiue;tts d&amp;apos;escliatologie inusulnane in Conzpte Rendu du 3. Congres Scient.

Replying to an objec tion, he writes :l &amp;quot;I do not deny that the literal sense perhaps proves that the spirit exists prior to the body. It is very convenient to take texts in a literal sense, when it is possible to interpret them allegorically and when there is a conclusive rational de600stration which destroys the literal sense Under these circumstances, the allegorical interpretation is obligatory, as is the case with those texts in which anthropomorphic qualities are attributed to God.&amp;quot; From this discussion it seems fair to conclude that the prin ciple of interpreting the Quran was rightly recognised in Islam. It seems even certain that one could go very far in one&amp;apos;s allegorising (as the sufi mystics did), without ceasing to be an orthodox Muslim.&amp;apos; It is unfair, then, on this score alone to accuse Ibn Rushd of using &amp;quot; interpretation &amp;quot; merely as a ruse for concealing his rationalism and s300ticism. Yet this is what M. De Wulf does in his standard History of Medieval Philosophy .2 &amp;quot; Many of the teachings of Averroes run counter to the Musal n}an religion. It was, indeed, because the Khalifs had reason to suspect his orthodoxy that they persecuted and banished him. But Averroes had foreseen the trouble; and he tried to meet it by dis- tinguishing between the literal interpretation of the Quran, which was all right for the illiterate, and its allegorical interpretation, which was the proper one for the educated.... Here we have the first foundations of the doctrine of the two truths, so extensively promulgated by the Averroists of the Middle Ages.&amp;quot; M. De Wulf apparently suggests that the distinction between the literal and the allegorical sense was an invention of Averroes One would imagine that the Alexandrian Fathers, not to speak of Ibn Tufail and al-Ghazali, had never been heard of. The further suggestion that Averroes&amp;apos; interpretation was merely an expedient to avoid banishment is historically unten able. Ibn Rushd, who had been presented to Abu Yaqub by Ibn Tufail, acted as judge and for a time as court physician. Under Abu Yusuf al-Mansur he was also in high favour, and it was at the desire of this prince that he undertook his great com mentaries on Aristotle.8 Towards the end of his life, however, 1 Ibid , p. 724. 2 Eng. trans. by Dr. P.

The causes of this disgrace are rather obscure. It is quite clear (pace Renan it was not due to the orthodox zeal of the Almohad Khalif. The Almohads (founded by Ibn Tumart constituted a victorious reaction against the blind traditionalism and literalism of the Almoravids. The very name al,-ynuwahhidin (the unitarians designates those who reject the anthropomorphic con300t of God as a multiplicity of attributes and qualities. The views of Ibn Rushd agree with those of Ibn Tumart; both were inuwahhids or assertors of God&amp;apos;s tawhid (unity and spiritual simplicity), and both applied tawil (interpretation to the anthro pomorphic passages of the Quran. On one point, however, Ibn Rushd seems to have differed from the Almohads. These latter (like the Mutazilites and even the Asharites wished to spread their philosophical formulas and interpretations broad cast a600g the multitude; while the author of the Fasi al- magal was resolutely opposed to any such philosophical catechising, and it must be confessed that he had the Quran as well as sound state-policy on his side. It may well have been, then, than Ibn Rushd was too orthodox for the reforming Abu Yusuf, who perhaps availed himself of the popular outcry against the philosopher1 in order to mask his own still more daring schemes. These considerations suffice to discredit IIMT . De Wulf&amp;apos;s attack on Ibn Rushd&amp;apos;s orthodoxy. The still more formidable indict ment of M. Gauthier and Fr. Manser remains to be considered. It has been reserved until last because it is in a sense an attack on the whole Muslim system of faith and theology. After analysing the Fast al-magal at considerable length, M. Gauthier concludes that the treatise &amp;quot; does not contain a single word which shows in the author&amp;apos;s thought any subordination of philo sophy to religion. The philosophical doctrine which is extracted from the work is an unreserved rationalism.&amp;quot;2 In view of the evidence I have outlined above, this judgment of M. Gauthier may well be characterised, in the words of Prof. HHorten, as &amp;quot;scarcely comprehensible.&amp;quot; M. Gauthier himself seems con scious of the paradox, for immediately he tries to &amp;quot;interpret&amp;quot; The works of Ibn Rushd were extensively condemned and prohibited by his fanatical co-religionists. But they found many Jewish admirers. Indeed only in Hebrew translations or by a transliteration of the Arabic text in Hebrew characters did his works escape the Moors. 2 L.

In spite of the in genuity displayed, M. Gauthier&amp;apos;s attempt must be pronounced unsuccessful, as I shall presently show. &amp;quot;One feels rather be wildered,&amp;quot; M. Gauthier confesses,&amp;apos; &amp;quot;when in numerous passages of the Manahij and of the Tahafut, one meets apparently a new Averroes who professes to believe in mysteries and miracles, to subordinate philosophy to religion, the evidence of reason to the revelations of prophecy.&amp;quot; How does M. Gauthier deal with these passages The process is very sum mary.2 &amp;quot;Since the doctrine of the Fasl al-maqal is an un reserved rationalism, we have every right to believe a Priori that an antirationalist interpretation of certain passages of the two other treatises can only be the result of an initial misunder standing.&amp;quot; This is certainly piling a hypothetical Pelion upon a still more hypothetical Ossa. Before resorting to such a violent solution of the itntinoniy, it would be well to inquire if there be any antinomy at all. Perhaps the difficulty lies not in Averroes, but in the rationalist brush with which he has been so persistently tarred To answer this question I have to examine briefly the rationalist principles which M. Gauthier reads into or out of the texts. The most far reaching is this.3 &amp;quot; It is only for the mob that there can be question of mysteries properly so-called; all de600strable truths necessarily appear as impenetrable mysteries to the vulgar crowd; and the philosophers must, under pain of infidelity or heresy, present them to the crowd as mysteries, though they themselves possess proofs of these truths.&amp;quot; As the distinction of the three classes of men was current before the time of Ibn Rushd, this objection would seem to strike the reli gious system of Islam and not any individual thinker. In so far as it is deduced from Ibn Rushd, it is based on a few texts such as the following :4 &amp;quot; It is not possible to explain all the speculative questions on which the Law is silent, or to declare to the multitude the con clusions to which speculation leads as if they were essential to the Law. A man should then be silent on subjects on which the Law is silent; he should tell the multitude that human reason is unable to fathom such problems; he should not exceed the religious teaching given in the Law, for this is the teaching meant for all alike and sufficient for the attainment of happiness.&amp;quot; 1 Ibid., p.

Averroism and Scholasticism. 705 It might be just possible to interpret this to mean that there are no mysteries for &amp;quot;tile plan of de600stration,&amp;quot; were there not numerous other passages in the same and other works of Averroes, which directly contradict such a conclusion. For in stance, we are told that &amp;quot; those who admit that a positive religion founded solely on reason can exist, must grant that this religion is inferior to the religion which is based on both reason and revelation. &amp;quot; According to M. Gauthier this means: &amp;quot; A philosophical religion founded entirely on abstract reasoning would only suit men of de600stration, while a prophetical reli gion, by the outer sense of its texts which express its imagina tive intuitions, addresses itself to the spirit and heart of all men; while by its allusions it attracts the attention of philosophers alone to the rational interpretation of these same texts.&amp;quot; This ethico-social reason may well be true to the mind of Ibn Rushd; but it does not exclude the function of revealed religion which he upholds some pages further on : 2 &amp;quot; Philosophy seeks to investigate the teaching of revelation. If philosophy succeeds in knowing such teaching, then it agrees with revelation; but if not, then it knows the limitation of the human intellect, which cannot grasp these mysteries although revelation knows them.&amp;quot; Such a declaration is too explicit to be tortured into rationalism. The following texts are equally clear : &amp;quot; Ghazali says that we must have recourse to revelation for all that human reason is incapable of comprehending. This is true. For the knowledge which comes from revelation completes the knowledge of the natural reason. That is, God teaches man by revelation whatever is beyond the reach of his reason.&amp;apos; But these truths, knowledge of which is necessary for man&amp;apos;s life and existence and which reason is incapable of grasping, are of two kinds. (i There are truths absolutely incomprehensible, i.e., which reason as such3 is unable to comprehend. (2 There are others which are incomprehensible relatively to a certain class of men. Thus the incapacity is due either (i to essential human nature, or (2 to something extrinsic, e.g., the neglect of education.&amp;quot;4 1 Taliafut, p. 280, Horten ; Asin, El Averrols,nao, p. 289 ; Gauthier, La theoric, p. &amp;apos;47 2 TahaJut,p. 248 f, Horten. 3 Gauthier (p. 151 and Manser. 254, n . interpret &amp;quot; reason as such&amp;quot; as discursive reason without prophetic intuition. This does not really affect my argument that, according to Averroes, normal human reason without special elevation is unable to comprehend many revealed truths. And, as Averroes himself adds, this inability&amp;apos; is due to the essence (osut literally&amp;apos; root&amp;apos; of human nature.&amp;quot; 4 Taltafut, p. x8o, Horten, (DD., p. r47 f); Asin, p. 286.</page><page sequence="21">706 Studies. [MARCH, &amp;quot; The principles of religion are divine things which surpass the comprehension of human intelligence. Hence we must hold them even though we do not know their reasons. Hence, too, you do not find that any of the ancient Greeks treated of miracles, although the evidence for miracles in the world is notorious. They are indeed, the principles of religion, and therefore of virtues.1 &amp;quot; The ancient Greeks have not a single word about miracles. For, according to them, these are things which cannot be scientific ally discussed, since they are principles of religions. Hence, whoever speculates and doubts concerning them deserves punish ment, according to these philosophers, just as he who speculates on the other principles of religions, e.g., the existence of the most high God, of [future happiness, of virtues. Their existence may not be doubted, although their mode of being is something divine and inaccessible to human reason.&amp;quot;2 These passages, and many others equally clear, 3 show that for Averroes there were such things as articles of faith, i.e., truths which are believed on God&amp;apos;s authority and not on intrinsic rational grounds. As instances, he mentions creation ex nihilo, the Quranic details concerning the future life, certain truths concerning God&amp;apos;s essence and knowledge. On this point Ibn Rushd was at one with al-Ghazali. The view of both may be conveniently summarised in the following statement of al Ghazali : &amp;quot; Revelation contains nothing which contradicts reason. If by &amp;apos;contradicting reason&amp;apos; is meant that some rational de600stration proves the absurdity of some teaching of revelation (e.g.,, that God creates something equal to Himself, or that a thing is and is not at the same time ; then I assert that revelation never teaches such doctrines. If by `contradicting reason&amp;apos; is meant that reason is incapable of reaching what revelation teaches, or of having com prehensive knowledge of the intrinsic essence of revealed truths; then I assert that such doctrines are taught, but they must not, on this account, be said to be impossible.&amp;quot; The arguments adduced so far would seem toprove that Averroes upheld the Christian con300t of revelation. But this conclusion requires investigation and modification. It must be remembered that the strictly &amp;quot; revealed &amp;quot; content of Islam was very small; it had no mysteries comparable to the Trinity and Incarnation, it had no theology of Redemption. It follows that what would be rationalism for a Christian would not be so for a 1 Ibid., pp. 262 f, Horten, (DD., p. 335 a ; Gauthier, p. 12&amp;apos;. 2 Ibid., pp. 250 f, Horten, (DD., p. 33t e ; Gauthier, p. 127. 3 See Horten, Die Hauptlehren, pp. 335 f. &amp;quot; Asia, A lgazel, p. 644.</page><page sequence="22">1914. Averroism and Scholasticism. 707 Muslim. The latter had fewer mysteries, fewer revealed truths which his reason could not comprehend. So it was natural that he should lay greater stress on the power of reason. The Muhammadan philosopher rushes in where Christians fear to tread. Thus it may happen that, judged from a Christian standpoint, Averroes appears to be a rationalist. But, as this whole article has shown, such a judgment would necessarily prove that every educated Muslim was a rationalist, and so would have no special force against Ibn Rushd. This remark also applies to M. Gauthier&amp;apos;s argument against Ibn Rushd, based on the absence of any definitive dogmatic authority in Islam. The three sources of the Islamic religious law are the Quran, the su nnah (traditions from the Prophet), and the ijma (unanimous agreement of the community). Ibn Rushd admitted that, if Musalmans are unanimous in taking a certain text in its exterior sense, then to interpret it is infidelity, i.e., tawil is limited by the ijma. M. Gauthier objects that this unanimity is impossible to prove, and so the concession is quite nugatory. This objection was employed by Ibn Rushd himself&amp;apos; against al Ghazali, and he concludes that in speculative questions the test of unanimity is practically inapplicable. But it is quite futile to urge this as a special objection against Ibn Rushd. The only victory which M. Gauthier has scored (albeit unconsciously is an apologetic argument for Catholicism against Islam. Ibn Rushd must, then, be acquitted of rationalism, once it is shown that he admits the principle that God can reveal truths which reason is unable to comprehend. Even as applied to Christianity, however, this principle is liable to be misunder stood. We must not so exaggerate the supernatural as to render it irrational. The early Fathers saw hints of revelation everywhere; they unearthed the Trinity in the epistles of Plato. And there have been saints who claimed an intuition of the Trinity. But this intuition is by Christians regarded as a special supernatural gift from God, whereas in Islam there is a constant tendency to regard such mystic union and contemplation as the culmination of a psychological training or of a philosophical education. This tendency to what we should nowadays term a naturalistic explanation of religious experience, is probably, to a large extent, due to the defective dogmatic outfit of Islam, and to the absence of any authoritative exponent. Apart from its practical prescriptions, there is little in Islam but a philoso 1 Fast al-magal, p. 28, Gauthier.</page><page sequence="23">708 Studies. [MARCH, phical 600otheism embedded in folklore. Unless this fact is kept in mind, it will be impossible to understand the Muslim tendency to identify religion and philosophy. Even when, as in the case of Averroes, religion is admitted to teach more than philosophy, the margin is much narrower than a Christian would expect. In this connection, the romance&amp;apos; written by Ibn Tufail, called &amp;quot; Alive, Son of Awake,&amp;quot; is particularly instructive as casting light on the intellectual environment of Ibn Rushd. The author introduces us to an island whose inhabitants lead con ventional lives, and are content with the popular religion. Two men rise to a higher level; one of these, Salaman, ac300ts the externals of the ordinary religion, and rules over the people; the other, Asal, seeks solitude in a neighbouring island. There he finds Hayy ibn Yaqzan, a hermit who, by solitary reflection, has reached the highest stage of philosophical illumination. In fact, philosophy has led Hayy as far as revelation has led Asal. Hayy is moved by zeal to undertake a mission of enlightenment to the other island. But he soon finds that Muhammad&amp;apos;s method of sensuous imagery is the only one for the multitude. So he abandons his scheme and returns to solitude. This little story tells us the tragedy of the philosopher in Islam; for Hayy represents Ibn Tufail himself. But, what is more to the present purpose, it also tells us how closely philo sophy approximated to a religion in the eyes of the Muslim thinker. It is so important to decide the limits to such an approxima tion that, before concluding the present section, I will try to show that, besides admitting mysteries, the Musalman philo sophers (and, in particular, Ibn Rushd also admitted the special divine inspiration of a prophet and the existence of miracles. Muhammad, who regarded himself as an apostle (rascal greater than a prophet (nabi), and as &amp;quot;the the seal of the prophets &amp;quot; (Quran 3340), admitted that since the time of Adam a great number of prophets have been sent into the world as inter preters of God&amp;apos;s will. To Christ alone Muhammad conceded the power to work miracles (Quran 341_43); he always disclaimed such a power for himself, and appealed to the Quran as the only proof of his mission.

Already in al-Farabi we meet with a complete theology or psychology of a miracle-working inspired prophet :&amp;apos; &amp;quot; The prophetical mind is provided with a sacred force which the macrocosm obeys just as man&amp;apos;s microcosm obeys his mind. Hence the prophetical power can work miracles beyond human skill and the ordinary course of nature. His mirror [re300tive intellect is never rusted [by lower passions so as to unfit him for receiving the impress of those immutable characters which are written on the well-kept Tablet, or so as disconnect him from union with the angels who are God&amp;apos;s messengers [to lower creatures]. Thus he receives knowledge of the things of God.&amp;quot; We have here a theory of miracles and of divine illumination which seems to be inspired by Gnosticism and Neo-Platonism. A little further on, al-Farabi makes another interesting remark concerning visions. &amp;quot;The mind of the prophet,&amp;quot; he says,2 &amp;quot; speaks to the angels when he is awake, while the minds of other men communicate with them only when asleep.&amp;quot; Ibn Sina still further develops the con300t of prophetism : &amp;quot;The most perfect of these ideal men [philosophers is he who is disposed for the grade of prophet. In his soul he possesses three special characteristics: (i he hears the word of God, (2 he sees the angels of God, (3 these angels assume at times a definite shape which he sees. He who is favoured with a revelation has the angels represented to him in images as we have shown. There also resounds in his ears a voice which he perceives, and which comes from God and the angels. This he hears without its being a real word pronounced by men or other earthly creatures.&amp;quot;l Apparently, Ibn Sina quite admits the objectivity of the prophetic revelation. He is quite clear, however, that the IL Buch der Ringsteine, 28, trans., Horten, pp. 20 f (Munster, igo6 ; also in Horten, Texte, p. 3. On the guarded Tablet, see Quran, 8521-22. 2 l bid., 24, p. 2r (Texte, p. 3). St. Thomas (ST. r, q 12, a II writes :-- Anima nostra quanto magis a corporalibus abstrahitur, tanto intellegibilium abstractorum fit capacior. Unde in somniis et alienationibus a sensibus corporis magis divinae revelationes percipiuntur et praevisiones futurorum. Scotus [4 sent, d 45, q 2 objected that this was taken from Islam Cajetan in loc. (ed.

It seems clear that this growing, interest in the &amp;quot; prophet &amp;quot; is inspired (perhaps unconsciously by the idea that Muhammad was not the last of the prophets. Prophetism is being allied with mysticism.</page><page sequence="25">710 Studies. [MARCH, existence of a prophet is conditioned by natural processes.&amp;apos; &amp;quot; There cannot always be a prophet in existence. For the matter which is capable of receiving such an entelechy occurs in only a few of the comminglings of human nature.&amp;quot; Evidently such grace can only work in an organism wherein the humours are perfectly mixed. The completest summary of the views of the falasifah on miracles and prophecy is to be found in al-Ghazali&amp;apos;s Taha f ut.2 I-Iis, exposition is all the more important because, with one ex300tion, al-Ghazali, on behalf of orthodox Islam, expresses his agreement with the philosophers. As the passage is so interesting and so important, I will cite it at some length With respect to the miracles which break the ordinary course of natural phenomena, the philosophers only admit three things: &amp;quot; (i A certain property or special characteristic in the imagina tive faculty.They hold in effect that when this faculty is strong and predominant, when it is not weakened and distracted by the outer senses, then it is able to perceive the Tablet of destiny in which the divine decrees are preserved, so that the species or images of all future particulars are impressed on the faculty. This happens to the prophet when awake, and to other men when asleep. This virtue of the imagination is what the theolo gians call the gift of prophecy. (2 A certain property or characteristicin the speculative intellect, which reduces to what we call sagacity, i.e., rapidity of inferring the unknown from the known. Thus, if something is presented to a sagacious man for proof, theroof at once occurs to him .w and reciprocally. And in general when the middle term w is known to him, he a once sees the conclusion; and when he knows the terms of the conclusion, the mediating term at once occurs to him. In this respect men are not at all equal. There are some (such as we have mentioned who arrive at knowledge by them selves, others when their attention is drawn thereto, others again only after -toilsome effort. Hence if at the extreme of intellectual imperfection there are men who are completely lacking in sagacity, so incapable they are ncapable of understanding intelligible things, even when their attention is directed to them; so also at the other extreme of energy and facility of intellect there can exist men who grasp the intelligibles (or most of them in the shortest pos sible time, and with the greatest possible ease. For in this gift there are differences both with respect to quantity according as all or some of the questions are perceived, and with respect to the quality according as this happens with more or less speed and facility. A holy and pure soul approaches this extreme; its 1 Met., tr. zo, d. 3 ; Horten, Texte, pp. 8 f. 2 Asin, A&amp;apos;gaze&amp;apos;, pp. 780 if; Horten, Texte, pp. 9-12. See this theory also in Ibn Rushd`s Fast al-magal, pp. 31 f. Gauthier, and the Appendix (or third treatise p. 122, Muller.</page><page sequence="26">1914. Averroism and Scholasticism. 711 sagacity continues to comprehend the intelligibles with the greatest rapidity. Such is the soul of the prophet whose speculative faculty realises this miracle, viz., that he needs no teacher to perceive the intelligibles, but learns everything by himself. And this is the meaning of the metaphorical description which the Prophet gives in the Quran : His oil is always ready to light ; though no fire is applied, it gives increasing light. (3 The vital practical or active power, which can reach such an intensity that it exercises an influence and dominion over natural objects. Of this we have an example in our own soul , which, if the imagination presents anything desirable, is served by the bodily limbs and the motive faculties, which move towards the object imagined and desired. Thus the imagination of some dainty at once makes one&amp;apos;s mouth water; so, too, a sensual image produces excitement... . Not all souls have this dominion over bodies in an equal degree, it varies according to the spiritual improbable and purity of each one. Hence it is not mprobable that this virtue of the soul should become so intense that the natural power of another body distinct from its own should obey it. For the soul does not in form the body; it is simply endowed with a kind of innate inclination and ardent desire to govern and direct the body. So if it is possible that the parts of its body obey the soul, it is not impossible that a body distinct from its own should obey it. And in this manner U.e., caused bythe prophet&amp;apos;s soul there can happen a wind, a rainfall, lightning, an earthquake which destroys a whole nation. For the occurrence of such phenomena depends on certain conditions, e.g., cold or heat or motion in the atmosphere; hence if this cold or heat is directly caused by the soul, these phenomena will certainly occur without the intervention of the exterior physical causes. And this would be a miracle of the prophet, in spite of the fact that it happens only in an atmosphere prepared or disposed for the production of such phenomena. Such miracles are admissible since they do not extend so far as the Transmutation of a wooden rod into a serpent or the splitting of the moon which is unbreakable.&amp;quot; This is the teaching of the philosophers concerning miracles. I do not deny anyof these statements, nor do I deny that these three faculties or virtues are characteristic of the prophets. The only thing that I deny is the final restriction which the philo sophers place in their rejecting the possibility of the transforma tion of a rod into a serpent, or of raising a dead man to life, etc. The really significant portion of this quotation lies in the last paragraph, where al-Ghazali (with a limitation to be con sidered presently ac300ts the theory of prophetism as part of the creed of Islam. Unlike certain moderns, he does not appear to have scented &amp;quot;rationalism&amp;quot; therein. The orthodox character of the theory is still further confirmed by the fact it was also incorporated into medieval Judaism. For instance, Saadyah (89:2-942), the opponent of the philosophers, teaches it quite</page><page sequence="27">712 Studies. [MARCH, explicitly.&amp;apos; Still more suggestive is its ac300tance by Yehudah ha-Levi (circa 1o85-r 145 in his great defence of Judaism, the al-Khazari, wherein he reproduces so many of al-Ghazali&amp;apos;s thoughts. According to him,2 the man in whose temperament the humours are evenly mixed &amp;quot; is the person on whom the divine and prophetic spirit is poured out, if he is fit for prophecy. But if he stands below that degree, he is only endowed with inspiration. In the latter case he is a pious man, but no prophet. There is no niggardliness with God, who allows everyone his due. Philosophers call the giver of this degree Active Intellect, and regard it as an angel below God.&amp;quot; It is clear, then, that, in ac300ting the theory of prophetism, Ibn Rushd was guilty of no special heterodoxy; he was merely adopting the view ac300ted by other pious Muslims and Jews. But what about his rejection of the possibility of certain miracles If my -previous conclusions are correct, this last charge against him is the sole accusation of irreligion which still remains to be examined. If this charge proves unfounded, then there seems to be no further reason for propagating the legend of an agnostic Averroes: Now, whatever be the case with Avicenna, it can be shown quite clearly that the only &amp;quot; miracle &amp;quot; which Averroes rejected was the perpetration of a logical impossibility. &amp;quot; It is evident,&amp;quot; he writes,3 &amp;quot; that not all things are possible to God; for it is inconceivable that the perishable should be eternal, or the eternal perishable. Similarly, it is impossible that the angles of a triangle should equal four right angles, or that colours should be heard.&amp;quot; That he does not mean to limit God&amp;apos;s omnipotence, is shown by several other passages. Even when he seems to be confused and hesitating, he is quite emphatic that his doubt is solely as to whether the event in question be not self-contradictory. For instance, he writes :4 &amp;quot;Experience shows that something receives its final form only after many intermediate forms. Can this thing also receive its final form directly and immediately The theologians answer affirmatively. Not so the philosophers who urge this reason: if the usual mediating forms were superfluous, then wisdom would create the final form(e.g., man without these.

For mancannot do all that is in itself possible; since what is possible for man to do is known, and most of the things that are possible in themselvesare impossible to him. Now, a prophet wins credence by working miracles. But this does not require us to admit that things logically impossible are possible to the prophets. , If you examine the miracles whose authenticity is certain, you will find that they are of this kind [i.e., logically possible]. The most evident of such miracles is the precious Book of God. . . . The way in which cultured men come to believe in the prophets is another way [besides miracles]. Ghazali himself refers to it in several places. It consists in the activity which results from the prophet&amp;apos;s distinctive quality, viz., the revealing of hidden things, and the institution of religious laws which agree with the [divine truth, and bring about actions which make for the happiness, of humanity.&amp;quot; This clear declaration is an eloquent testi600y to the religious insight and reverence of Ibn Rushd; it may be allowed to stand here as the coup de grace to that flimsy legend which has grown up round the memory of a great man out of the accumulated errors of lesser minds. We see by it that Ibn Rushd regards the moral and social revolution effected by reli gion as a greater miracle than any physical prodigies. In this he is but following Muhammad, and the best thought of Islam and of Judaism is with him.2 And we, too, Christians of the twentieth century, do we not regard the moral regeneration and the social mission of the Church as the most potent argument for the divinity of its Founder And, looking further back, do we not see in the Hebrew theocracy, with its pure 600otheism and its high moral code, with its prophetic yearning for One to come do we not see herein a confirmation of our Faith If we do, let us not forget that Ibn Rushd, too, acknowledged the Law and the Prophets.
