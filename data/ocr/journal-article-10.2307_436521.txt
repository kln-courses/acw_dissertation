<plain_text><page sequence="1">Transformation Symbolism and the Liturgy of the Mass in Pearl John Gatta, Jr. I Although commentators have often recognized the pervasive presence of liturgical allusions and correspondences in Pearl, these ritualistic resonances have never, to my knowledge, been taken together as an essential index of the poem's meaning or used as a major interpretive device. To be sure, one early critic sought to define the entire substance of the work by seeing in it a hidden allegorical representation of, and tribute to, the Eucharist. But this attempt by R. M. Garrett was more of a supposition leading to a simple assertion than a genuine interpretation.' Under- standably, critics and reviewers either discounted or ignored Garrett's thesis, which lacked convincing evidence while failing to account for most of the actual details in the Pearl poet's presentation.2 Moreover, A. C. Spearing's excellent study, "Sym- bolic and Dramatic Development in Pearl,"3 has since demonstrated the virtual necessity of viewing the poem's symbols-and the pearl symbol especially-in flexible, dynamic terms. Unlike Garrett's static, one-to-one equation between pearl symbol and Communion wafer, Spearing's transformational-process approach relates developing patterns of symbolism to the interior dramatic development of the narrator. By stressing the less mechanical how as well as the what of symbolism, Spearing has defined the probable course of future discussion on the topic. And yet, despite the possibly misguided substance of Garrett's thesis, his idea of applying research in liturgical backgrounds to a critical reading appears to be essentially viable. Where his treatment falls short is in its attempt to connect the pearl symbol in isolation with but one aspect of the eucharistic liturgy, the visible moment of elevation. Much too narrow in scope, Garrett's effort concerns itself neither with the mystery-action of the liturgy as a whole, nor with the transforma- tional implications of specific elements such as the offertory procession and its accompanying notion of sacrifice. Had the essay done so, I believe it might have extended our appreciation of how the poet applied a gradually developing symbol- ism, and would have provided a deeper basis for understanding the possible elegiac construction of the poem. One of my purposes here, therefore, is to indicate, by identifying liturgical resonances, the extent to which the Pearl poet drew upon and might have been inspired by several aspects of the medieval Mass liturgy in com- posing his elegiac narrative.4 I also hope to reveal particular ways in which this 1/R.

Only on account of this restricted definition have I not counted James P. Oakden's recent article ("The Liturgical Influence in Pearl," in Chaucer und seine Zeit: Symposionfiir Walter F. Schirmer, ed. Arno Esch [Tubingen, 1968], pp. 337-53) an exception to my opening statement: Oakden's study, which contains some valuable material, is concerned with specific influences traced to the Missal and the Breviary, with funeral rites in particular, rather than with the influence of the Mass as an integrated ritual enactment. 243</page><page sequence="2">244 Modern Philology (February 1974) sacred ritual informs the meaning of Pearl and illuminates the pattern inherent in its use of symbolism. A partial justification for trying to approach the poem in this fashion-and here Garrett's work is to some degree suggestive-is our awareness that some first- hand knowledge and experience of the Mass liturgy was universal among educated persons in the Middle Ages. For both the poet and his audience, the Mass would have been, presumably, the supreme expression of life's most sublime religious truths. Nowhere did medieval man come closer to finding time intersect with the eternal in the midst of his everyday experience than in this central drama of sacred mystery and transcendence, prayer and belief. Thus, the Mass could have been used by the Pearl poet as a vital point of reference for shared religious beliefs. Of course, these speculations prove little without evidence of definite links between Pearl and the Mass liturgy. But such evidence appears to be plentiful enough. Most obvious in support of some degree of direct liturgical influence is the explicit ac- count of the Eucharist in the final stanza: To pay pe Prince oper sete sa3te Hit is ful epe to pe god Krystyin; For I haf founden hym, bope day and na3te, A God, a Lorde, a frend ful fyin. Ouer pis hyul pis lote I la3te, For pyty of my perle enclyin, And sypen to God I hit byta3te In Kryste3 dere blessyng and myn, pat in pe forme of bred and wyn pe prest vus schewe3 vch a daye. He gef vus to be his homly hyne And precious perle3 vnto his pay. [Lines 1201-12]5 The word "Mass" occurs in two places (lines 497, 1115); beyond this, critics have noted a number of references with covert liturgical connections. Elizabeth Hart discovered that the poet's inclusion of an infant in the procession of the 144,000 virgins may be explained liturgically: the procession passage (Rev. 14) was the Epistle read in the Mass on the Feast of the Holy Innocents; furthermore, the Gospel on this day identifies the age of the Innocents at the time of their death as "a bimatu et infra," corresponding to the Dreamer's remark, "pou lyfed not two 3er in oure pede" (line 483).6 5/All quotations are taken from E. V. Gordon's edition of Pearl (Oxford, 1953). Granted, an interpretation can depend too heavily on these lines, but every interpretation must take them and their prominent position into account; the lines cannot, if one considers seriously their contextual significance, be dismissed as merely "the conventional formula of benediction" (Carleton Brown [n.2 above], p. 44). 6/Elizabeth Hart, "The Heaven of Virgins," Modern Language Notes 42 (1927): 115-16. For further proof that liturgical texts and commentaries stand behind the writing of Pearl, in the poet's portrayal of the Maiden and in his highly unusual application of the parable of the vineyard (glossed by reference to a sermon commentary written for Septuagesima Sunday by Honorius of Autun), see Ian Bishop, "Pearl" in Its Setting (Oxford, 1968).

As the essay progresses, however, I plan to identify some new correspondences and to apply the accumulated weight of current and previous liturgical suggestions to the development of an interpretation. II Following the waning of controversy about whether Pearl is pure allegory or pure elegy, two new models, the contemplatio and the consolatio, have been proposed as alternative methods of approaching the poem. Since questionable assumptions underlie both of these new approaches, a quick review of them here may be useful in exposing my critical bias while clearing a way for the argument that follows. For Louis Blenkner, in "The Theological Structure of Pearl," the model informing the poem's meaning and narrative structure is located in the contempla- tive writings of widely known medieval mystics.' Blenkner's article, which describes the work as "a carefully structured poetic account of a spiritual itinerary culminating in an ecstasy of mystical contemplation," has much to recommend it; its analysis of stages in the Dreamer's psychic conversion is especially convincing. My only objection is that Blenkner's stress on the private experience of the contemplative too often leads us away from the poem's deeply felt interpersonal concern. Out of a father's problematic relation to his beloved but deceased daughter there arises in Pearl a formidable theological question as to the proper exercise of natural human love in a Christian context. Naturally, I am assuming here the literal representation of a child's death now accepted by most scholars. But I am also insisting on the primary importance of the father's literal crisis of human loss.8 Within the dis- tinctively "elegiac" conditions of the narrative, the Dreamer's attainment of spiritual salvation is made to depend directly upon whether he can reconcile his natural emotive attachments to a deceased loved one with the demands of a Christian commitment. But from the standpoint of contemplatio criticism the Dreamer's feelings about his child, while accepted as real rather than allegorical, are reduced to providing merely the occasion for a purely private experience of mystical ascent. Although the liturgical and the mystical-contemplative modes of religious experience are not mutually exclusive, the former stresses social, interpersonal aspects of belief far more than the latter. Man's relation to man before God, the fellowship of all Christians in the Mystical Body of Christ, man's apprehension of God through the intermediary agency of man in a communal ritual action-all of these are more characteristic of the Mass than of the mystic's way. Pearl, in turn, seems to concern itself with the connection between human love and religious experience, the role of a human intermediary in relation to the divine, and the communal character of the pertinent to the argument pursued in this essay, are proposals of W. C. Johnson ("The Imagery and Diction of The Pearl," ELH 20 [1953]: 179, n. 19) on possible baptismal associations, and James Oakden (n.4 above). 7/Traditio 24 (1968): 43-75. 8/No judgment is implied in these comments as to whether the poem is, strictly speaking, auto- biographical.</page><page sequence="4">246 Modern Philology (February 1974) final visio, to such an extent that a liturgical rather than a mystical-contemplative attitude of mind might more appropriately be sought as its informing model. Similar but stronger objections may be brought against the "Christian con- solatio" interpretations of John Conley' and V. E. Watts10 and the consolatio mortis reading of Ian Bishop."1 In general, these interpretations see the Dreamer's initial state as one of grudging resistance to God's will-fully reprehensible in its clinging to imperfect earthly goods and yearning after false happiness. The Dreamer must come to see his lost daughter as but a transient, imperfect good; carnal, earthly love must be supplanted by spiritual, heavenly love-that is, by a preference for immutable good, or the summum bonum. While the consolatio model is useful in many respects, its proponents tend to polarize earthly and divine love more sharply than I believe the poem warrants. One must agree in part with Conley's evaluation of the narrator's grief as reprehensible- there must, at any rate, be something less than saintly about an attitude that manages to provoke a heavenly Maiden to the sharp reply: "Bot, jueler gente, if pou schal lose py ioy for a gemme pat pe wat3 lef, Me pynk pe put in a mad porpose, And busye3 pe aboute a raysoun bref." [Lines 265-68] And, in deciding how a contemporary audience would have understood the poet's treatment of natural sentiment, it may be helpful to be reminded by Conley that an unqualified belief in the laudability of human love was not part of the medieval world view. But as A. C. Spearing has aptly perceived, Pearl establishes a con- tinuity, as well as a disparity, between earthly and heavenly love. Admittedly, medieval Christianity stressed the need for due measure and right order in the exercise of natural affections and remained sensitive to the spiritual dangers of allowing them to turn to excess or perversion. Placed in proper subordination to love for God, however, natural love might function as a personal redeeming force, a pathway to the divine. This notion was certainly a commonplace in medieval literature; in Dante's writings, for example, particularly in La vita nuova, it is a woman, a human object of the poet's affections, who points the way to God and becomes the agent of the poet's sanctification. Thus, even within a medieval context, Conley's summation of the Christian attitude toward natural affections is drastically one-sided: "The reprehension of natural love is profoundly Christian, as anyone knows who has read the New Testament, which is full of sayings harsh to carnal ears." 12 9/"Pearl and a Lost Tradition," Journal of English and Germanic Philology 54 (1955): 332-47; Conley's treatment is based chiefly on Boethius's Consolation. 10/V.

A statement as severe as this one seems to verge on the Gnostic position explicitly refuted by Dante in Purgatorio, canto 17, lines 91-99 (see, too, the rest of canto 17, and canto 18, for Dante's position on natural love); on the question of earthly love one might consider also passages dealing with caritas in Piers Plowman (B, passus 13, 15, 16), which affirm a strong correlation between love of God and love of man;</page><page sequence="5">Gatta/Pearl 247 Since the consolatio approach does not, in most instances, allow any element of continuity between earthly and heavenly love, critics of this persuasion ordinarily conceive of the father's natural affection for his child as nothing more than a negative obstacle to holiness. What matters in such a case is that the Dreamer come to understand and accept the workings of the divine will, and in accepting, to be subdued and comforted. Yet, after examining carefully the import of the final stanza, one may wonder whether the narrator's account does in fact culminate in this more or less passive acceptance. Perhaps the final outcome of his transforma- tion is better described as a sacrificial act, a motion of personal offering. Thus, his initially passive "I leste hyr" (line 9) gives way in the end to a positive act of commitment in which he consciously, deliberately offers "perle" to God: "And sypen to God I hit byta3te" (line 1207, emphasis supplied). His ultimate renunciation of natural claims of affection for the sake of God is likewise a self-renunciation. The supreme ethical value projected by the poem as a whole is in this case a profoundly sacrificial attitude of mind and heart, in which loss is not merely accepted, but positively offered to God. It is precisely because natural bonds of affection are essentially laudable and valuable that the father's voluntary act of severing them becomes meaningful. The Maiden-daughter upbraids him not because his loving and grieving instincts to mourn her death are in themselves wholly reprehensible, but because his grief needs to be redirected, his ability and will to love, refined. Rather than "Braundysch and bray," allowing his "wreched wylle" to sustain bereavement indefinitely, he has first to understand exactly what it is that is potentially laudable and ennobling in his natural sentiments, meanwhile purging himself of all that is self-indulgent, foolishly misplaced. From there, aided by the Maiden, he can begin the painful but redemptive process of transferring his thwarted affection into productive channels. If the Maiden speaks harshly to her father, consistently refusing him the "coumforde" (line 369) he requests, her purpose is to shake him out of his misplaced bereavement, to educate him forcefully, to draw him to the threshold of a free and forthright commitment.13 Her coldness does not, therefore, imply an indiscriminate repudia- tion of natural love, either by her or by the poet. It is she, after all, who leads her father to God, and she does so through, rather than despite, the force of earthly love. The consolatio approach allows as little continuity between the world of sense experience and the spiritual world as it does between earthly and heavenly love. Between matter and spirit, transient and immutable, visible and invisible, earthly and heavenly modes of understanding, lies irreconcilable difference. To accept these premises is to see the narrator arrive at a total rejection of the sensory world as he gradually adopts the Maiden's heavenly perspective. It is also to presume that the finally, to judge from Saint Augustine's reflections on the death of friends in the City of God (1.9.8), even this confirmed Neoplatonist could not have utterly castigated the Dreamer for his foolish and fervent bereavement. 13/Indeed, the Dreamer does momentarily find "coumforde," consolation at its basest level, during his first few moments in the land "per merualyle3 meuen," when he records that the "dubbement dere of doun and dale3 / Of wod and water and wlonk playne3 / Bylde in me blys, abated my bale3.. ." (lines 121-24). But instead of giving him "coumforde," the Maiden only intensifies his struggle, forces him to confront the terms of his inner ambivalence.</page><page sequence="6">248 Modem Philology (February 1974) philosophical world view expressed in Pearl enforces a rigid, Platonic-Augustinian dichotomy between sensible matter and spirit. But without denying distinction between transient and immutable, or that the Dreamer's final perspective is more "spiritual" than the one with which he began, one may still deny the supposition that sensory and spiritual function in essential opposition in this poem. Platonism, although immensely influential in medieval Christianity, was by no means the only available source for the Pearl poet's conceptual model of reality. III One way of explaining the intellectual basis of Spearing's insight that "between the earthly and heavenly world there exists at once difference and continuity,"14 is to observe the great influence of Thomistic philosophy in the fourteenth century. Out of the Scholastic upheaval and its rediscovery of Aristotle came a new recog- nition of the literal worth and empirical reality of the natural world, a serious acceptance of the concrete and visible. The thirteenth century brought a decisive affirmation, in other words, of man's senses and that which they perceive."' What might be called the sacramental view of reality, the attitude that sensible things exist in their own right while serving as signs of the sacred,16 applies in many respects to the image of sense reality presented in Pearl. Beginning with the description of the pearl in the opening stanza, the poet's special fondness for savoring physical detail is made manifest; and throughout this emphatically ornate poem, brocaded even in its verse form, there is an outpouring of appeals to the senses. The distrust of physical beauty familiar in contemporary English mystics was far from being shared by the Pearl poet,17 to judge from his resplendent material evocations of both the earthly and heavenly paradise; the "dere addubbemente" and "glemande glory" of the marvelous land are among his constant refrains. Such hints should prepare us to appreciate the considerable role of natural vision in effecting the Dreamer's spiritual transformation. The culminating visio of the Heavenly City, for example, while not the exact equivalent of natural vision, does involve an acquired form of spiritual perception that operates through the use of physical eyes. At times, of course, the Dreamer misunderstands or misuses his powers of natural perception, as in his foolish desire to swim "By3onde pe water" (line 1156). But just as in the case of natural love, the poem portrays man's progression toward holiness as proceeding with the assistance of, rather than despite, his natural sensory apparatus. Nowhere is the sacramental view better epitomized than in medieval beliefs concerning the Church's seven sacraments, particularly the Sacrament of the Altar. 14/"Symbolic and Dramatic Development in Pearl" (n.3 above), p. 7. 15/See Josef Pieper, Guide to St. Thomas Aquinas (New York, 1962), pp. 44-53 (supporting documentation in Thomas's writings is provided on p. 147, n. 9); Hans Meyer, The Philosophy of St. Thomas Aquinas (St. Louis, 1944), pp. 36-40; M.-D.

Eric Colledge, The Medieval Mystics of England (New York, 1961), pp. 28-29.</page><page sequence="7">Gatta/Pearl 249 Writing on the sacraments in the Summa theologica, Saint Thomas neatly expresses this sacramental view: "Signs are given to men, to whom it is proper to come to the unknown by means of the known. Consequently a sacrament properly so called is that which is the sign of some sacred thing pertaining to man so that properly speaking a sacrament .. is defined as being the sign of a holy thing so far as it makes men holy.""18 Thomas further defends the use of "corporeal signs" for sacred purposes, and the necessity of the sacraments for man's salvation, by pointing to "a condition of human nature to which it is proper to be led by things corporeal and sensible to things spiritual and intelligible." He declares, finally, that "man, consistently with his nature, is instructed through sensible things,"19 a statement that describes perfectly how the Pearl narrator gains awareness of spiritual truths. The sacramental theory finds expression as an active process of transformation in the liturgy of the Mass. There the present moment is actively united not only with the truth of God existing in eternity, but also, through the memoria totius vitae Christi, with the crucial historical event of God's becoming man. The "corporeal signs" used in the Mass are in themselves limited, frankly anthropomorphic sense- objects; but within the integrated mystery-action of the liturgy they are brought, through divine transformation, to express a sacred reality beyond man's inherent ability to express. Together, then, the individual "signs" or sacramental symbols in the Mass constitute a larger unity: the total symbol-in-process that is the Mass itself. In Pearl, likewise, the entire corporeal description of a sacred visio-the entire poem, in a sense-may be seen as a single "sign" or sacramental symbol. Moreover, most of the poem's individual symbols fit Saint Thomas's definition of a sacramental sign: each undergoes a sacralizing process of transmutation. Because the subjective conversion of the narrator is conceived of in relation to a substantial change in the realities signified by the symbols, the symbol-transformation movement in Pearl amounts to something more than a normative literary operation; instead, like the Mass (whose force derives from God rather than from human "magic"), it is a form of sacred occurrence, a mystery-action.20 Structurally, the most basic division of the Mass would consist of the Liturgy of the Word and the Liturgy of the Eucharist. In the Liturgy of the Word, major stress is given to instruction by means of scriptural readings. The Liturgy of the Eucharist follows, with its objective transformation of ordinary material gifts complemented, ideally, by the congregation's subjective participation in the sacred mysteries. On the whole, the Liturgy of the Eucharist emphasizes the visible ritual 18/Aquinas, Summa theologica, trans. Fathers of the English Dominican Province (Chicago, 1952), pt. 3, question 60, answer 2. 19/Ibid., 3. 61. 1. 20/J.A. Jungmann, S.J., in The Mass of the Roman Rite (New York, 1950), 1:20, affirms that the notion of the Mass as a "mystery-action" appears often in explanations written by medieval interpreters; according to Henri de Lubac (Corpus Mysticum [Paris, 1948], pp. 55-63) the term "mystery" then had special applications to the ritual action in the Mass whereby Christ becomes constituted sacramentally. Given the close association in the medieval mind between sacramentum and mysterium, references in Pearl to "Godde3 mysterys" (line 1194) and to Christ as the "Mayster of myste" (line 462) may be regarded as partaking, perhaps, of a sacramental orientation on the part of the poet.</page><page sequence="8">250 Modern Philology (February 1974) action of transformation over the auditory didactic Word of scriptural discourse featured in the previous liturgy-this distinction applies, at any rate, to the way a fourteenth-century congregation would have perceived the Mass. Using, then, Blenkner's basic structural division of Pearl, the structure of the Mass may be seen to correspond to the two-part dream experience of the narrator in the poem. The Dreamer's first visio experience, in the marvelous land, certainly occurs within a religious context; nevertheless, there his access to the sacred is confined mainly to hearing the Word of scripture preached by the Pearl Maiden, who also provides an appropriate commentary or exemplum. Quite apart from the specific import of the parable related by the Maiden, it is notable that she has chosen at this point to instruct him by means of a parable at all, and that she introduces it with the words, "As Mathew mele3 in your messe In sothfol gospel of God almy3t..." [Lines 497-98] Since the teaching regarding the salvation of innocents can have no immediate application in the Dreamer's own life, the main reason he should be presented with the parable of the vineyard here is to instruct him in the very manner of spiritual truth. A "sample" teaches spiritual truth by conceiving an analogical relation between natural and heavenly realms. A "sample" is thus a divinely ordained mode of instruction based on the sacramental view of reality: "In sample he can ful graypely gesse, And lykne3 hit to heuen ly3te." [Lines 499-500] Similarly, a structural correspondence with the mystery-action of Eucharistic transformation emerges in the second part of the poem, in the visio of the Heavenly City. By this time, instruction and verbal apologetics have been left behind, replaced by a more truly sacramental, visionary experience of the sacred realm. The narrator's interior conversion can proceed only part way with the assistance of auditory instruction. For the rest, revelation must replace instruction; the accents in the process come to be more distinctly visual and nondidactic: "Bot of pe Lombe I haue pe aquylde For a sypt perof pur3 gret fauor. Vtwyth to se pat clene cloystor pou may, bot inwyth not a fote." [Lines 967-70] That visual encounter surpasses any other mode of spiritual inspiration in psycho- logical force is underscored once more when the narrator sees his "lyttel quene" in the company of the Lamb (lines 1147-52). Meanwhile, the possibility of the poet's having brought to mind some con- nection between visual drama in the Liturgy of the Eucharist and his own visual concentration in the second part of Pearl is reinforced by certain specific conditions of worship in the fourteenth century. Visible aspects of the liturgy, especially the moment of elevation, were taking on greater importance as active participation by</page><page sequence="9">Gatta/Pearl 251 the laity declined and their reception of Communion became less frequent. It is telling in this regard that the closing eucharistic reference describes elements that "pe preste vus schewe3," rather than "gives us," "vch a daye" (line 1210). Also, during the later Middle Ages, there was special reason to identify the sacramental epistemology with the Mass and its material gifts of bread and wine since by then the sacramental view had begun to affect methods of explaining the liturgy itself, partially undercutting the Platonic assumptions inherent in some of the earlier, "allegorical" Mass theories.21 IV The offertory of the Mass, which corresponds to an essential theological element in the liturgy as a whole, has particular relevance to the study of Pearl. In the offertory section, the notions of offering and sacrifice present themselves most clearly although they reappear in the Te igitur and again, following the consecration, in the Supra quae. Traditional belief affirms that the sacrifice in the Mass is at once Christ's and that of all the members of his Church, a single sacrificiumn laudis offered in union with him and valuable only through him. Yet it is also an article of faith that if the Christian is to enter fully and worthily into the sacrifice offered at Mass, he must demand of himself an attitude of pure self-giving, a spiritual emptying of self symbolized by the material gifts rendered at the offertory. For acceptance of the human share in the offerings, not for acceptance of Christ's sacrifice, which is assured, the congregation then prays before God the Father. If the matter is approached with full seriousness, the personal import of the symbolic gift offered in the Mass is momentous. Assuming one is making a genuine sacrificial offering, the personal claims involved in ordinary gift giving, and the expectation of receiving in return, are disavowed. As C. G. Jung points out, present- ing the symbolic gifts of bread and wine cannot, therefore, be merely a propitiatory gesture; rather, in offering them, a man strives to make a total offering of himself inasmuch as he gives up gifts with which he has consciously identified.22 Such concepts of individual and Church sacrifice, as opposed to the sometimes prevalent notion of Christ's exclusive sacrifice in the Mass, were prominent in fourteenth- century England, and the Pearl poet would most likely have been exposed to them. As evidence, witness two passages, both from popular devotional guides, which describe the interior attitude with which one is supposed to approach the offertory: The offeratory .is named of offeryng As whan a man . offrithe to god his hert Richest oblacioun . rekene by writyng And for Melchisedeche. bothe prist and kyng Gaf brede and wyne . to Abraham for victory 21/Jungmann, 1: 113. 22/Throughout this section I have drawn freely from C.

[Langforde's Meditations]23 The Dreamer's movement toward accomplishment of a renunciatory act coincides significantly with the process of mind characteristic of liturgical sacrifice. In the opening stanzas his dominant sense is that of loss; in the closing two stanzas his mood has changed to one of thanksgiving ("eucharistic," in the literal sense) and personal commitment. Offering himself to God, he at last gains possession of himself. A climactic sign and embodiment of his self-giving is his willingness to give up his daughter, in whom his personal claims had been intimately bound up: And sypen to God I hit byta3te In Kryste3 dere blessyng and myn... Long after the Dreamer's initial state of emotional turmoil has been overcome, he projects a retrospective mood of thanksgiving in lines 1201-4 because his sacrificial loss has yielded an unintentional gain: the pearl he originally "leste" (line 9) becomes a "lote I la3te" (lines 1205) and, ultimately, the pearl "I ... byta3te" (line 1207). Furthermore, there are specific historical reasons for believing that sacrificial themes embodied in the Mass liturgy were a direct inspiration for those presented in Pearl. To begin with, Robert Ackerman has demonstrated that a commonly accepted correspondence existed in fourteenth-century England between the penny mentioned in the parable of the vineyard, which appears in the Pearl Maiden's discourse, and the daily bread of the Eucharist. His findings are based on Dan Michel's popular doctrinal treatise The A3enbite oflnwyt and several other vernacular versions of the same commentary. There the daily bread of the fourth petition of the Pater noster is identified not only with the penny of the parable, but also with the daily consecrated Host and thereby with the gift of salvation. Ackerman makes little interpretive use of his findings though he demonstrates conclusively that the poem's closing reference to the eucharistic elements carries a connecting allusion to 23/Both cited in The Lay Folks Mass-Book, ed. Thomas F.

The offertory of the communicants was retained, but became a Mass penny procession.25 If we include, therefore, the distinct possibility that the Pearl poet intended the penny in the parable to allude both to the consecrated Host and to the offertory penny (this last associated, in turn, with the original gifts of bread and wine), a number of intriguing suggestions emerge. These implications will now be developed in some detail. During the offertory, man returns to God symbols, bread and wine, that he first received from him. Before he can offer these gifts in the proper spirit, however, he must possess a sense of thanksgiving for what God has initially provided. In other words, each worker in the vineyard receives sustenance not from his own merits but from the grace and goodness of God, who gives "vchon inlyche a peny" (line 546). Failing to realize the undeserved character of God's gifts, some of the workers in the parable of the vineyard complain that they have not been justly compensated; likewise, the Dreamer's charges against the Maiden are, in her words, "pat I my peny haf wrang tan here" (line 614). Until he under- stands the nature of God's gifts-the gift of eternal salvation and earthly gifts alike, both symbolized by the "peny"-he is incapable of offering the "peny" again as his own gift of himself to the Father. But something like prevenient grace does prompt the Dreamer to begin a task of inner renewal. Eventually he comes to realize the nature of God's gifts, now offering himself in the form of his beloved daughter, and together with his natural possessive instincts, to God. The personal expenditure required in making this unsparing gesture consists of nothing less, in biblical terms, than purchasing the pearl of great price.26 Just as the interior movement toward self-renunciation taking place in the devout Christian as he participates in the Mass is paralleled in the objective transformation action of the liturgy proper, so too is the Pearl-narrator's interior process of transformation paralleled in the poem's developing exterior imagery. Developing symbols such as the ever-shifting pearl symbol become literary correlatives for conversion of the narrator's misplaced grief fervor into loving commitment. Our analysis may be extended further if it is accepted that the "peny" alluded to in the poem does, like the Mass penny in the liturgy, bear a transformational analogy with the ordinary bread and wine later changed into the Body and Blood of Christ. Thus, the narrator's daughter had been granted to him as a free gift from God; she is, in a definite but partial sense, God's "peny." As the narrator slowly 24/"The Pearl-Maiden and the Penny," Romance Philology 17 (1964): 621. 25/Backgrounds to Medieval English Literature (New York, 1966), pp. 47-48. 26/Matt. 13:45-46. A possible gloss on the poem's use of this parable (lines 730-44) may be found in Dan Michel's A5enbite of Inwyt (ed. R. Morris, EETS, no.23 [London, 1866], pp. 90-91), where the discussion on "Gentyl Guod" speaks of "charite" as "pe loue of herte / pet is pe godes peny / huer-mide me bayp / alle pe guodes of pe wordle.. . " Also valuable is Ren6 Wellek's comment ("The Pearl: An Interpretation of the Middle English Poem," in Studies in English [Prague, 1933], 4:1-33) that the narrator will in some way become the pearl in the process of purchasing it.</page><page sequence="12">254 Modern Philology (February 1974) comes to realize the nature of this particular gift, he voluntarily gives up his personal claims to it; the "peny" is then returned to God as the man's own offering. Accom- panying this sacrificial process, in which the identity of the narrator shares, is a transformation of the "peny"--in another guise, the "rose" (line 269)-into a "perle of prys" (line 272). If one can accept the line of reasoning just proposed, it becomes evident that, in addition to gradual development in the pearl symbol itself, a complex symbolic structure dependent on submerged cultural associations is operative in the poem. The transformation theme gathers new richness and significance if one recognizes how tensions are generated between the associative clusters of "peny"-"rose"-offertory bread-infant and "perle of prys"-Body of Christ-Heavenly Maiden. Subsidiary imagistic motifs work analogously: the "apple" or "Mete" (line 641) through which mankind fell into Original Sin becomes the "bote," the water and blood of Christ's passion. Water imagery appears first in the stream's "addube- ment" in the marvelous land, is used next by the Maiden as an image for God's grace (line 607), emerges again in the description of Christ's passion (stanza group xi), and finally becomes the river flowing out of the ground of the heavenly city. In many instances, earthly frames of reference, chiefly mercantile or courtly love imagery, are transvalued to relate spiritual concepts. Supporting the basic transformation pattern is a varied background of liturgical allusion. Subtle correspondences drawn between the standard liturgical year and vegetation-regeneration imagery coincide, in turn, with the regenerative ritual action of the Mass. Liturgically pertinent, therefore, is the "hy3 sesoun" (line 39) mentioned in the poem, whether this is the Feast of the Assumption or Lammas;27 the harvest reference resonates with the "newe fryt" (line 894) and with the allusion to John 24: For vch gresse mot grow of grayne3 dede; No whete were elle3 to wone3 wonne. [Lines 31-32] In the description of Christ's passion in stanza group 6, the water flowing from his body is explicitly equated with the sacramental water of baptism. The passage implies that the blood issuing from Christ's wound is similarly to be equated with the Eucharist since only thus would the adult Christian have corresponding access to the redeeming grace applied to infants through baptism. And inasmuch as it alludes to John 19:34, the passage also recalls the commixtio, or mingling of water and wine, during the offertory of the Mass. Now according to a traditional inter- pretation of the commixtio, which uses John 19:34 as a point of reference, the water in question is related to baptism (as is the case in Pearl) and the wine to the Euchar- ist.28 At the same time, the commingled water stands for the body formed by the 27/Ian Bishop (n.6 above), pp. 85-86, shows how the reaping-Lamas association might have applied to the entire month of August. 28/Henri de Lubac (n.20 above), pp. 205-7. The twofold symbolism of this commixtio inter- pretation is traditionally unified and explained with reference to Rev. 17:15; while, interestingly enough, the Book of the Apocalypse also served as a major source for the latter part of Pearl.</page><page sequence="13">Gatta/Pearl 255 members of the Church and its sacrifice, while the wine represents the aspect of Christ's sacrifice joined to that of the Church.29 Blenkner's citations from Hugh of St. Victor,30 together with Garrett's earlier observations, help to disclose eucharistic implications in the allusion to 1 Corin- thians 12 on the Mystical Body of Christ (lines 457 ff.). All who eat sacramentally of the flesh of the Lamb share alike in the Body of Christ. Just as the "makelle3 perle" is "commune to alle pat ry3twys were" (line 739), the Christian's eucharistic incorporation in the Mystical Body is consonant with the principle: "Of more and lasse in Gode3 ryche," pat gentyl sayde, "lys no joparde, For per is vch mon payed ifilyche, Wheper lyttel oper much be hys rewarde." [Lines 601-4]31 And as Henri de Lubac has shown in Corpus Mysticirm, the term "Mystical Body" as a traditional designation of the corporate communion of the Church in Christ evolved from an earlier usage, in which "Mystical Body" referred to the eucharistic Body of Christ. Several critics, in trying to explain the poet's concluding eucharistic reference, have suggested that through the Eucharist the narrator may gain spiritual access to his deceased daughter. But this idea, which comes close to making the Eucharist a sort of heavenly telephone, misses the point. Although resurrected into a trans- formed state of heavenly existence, the narrator's daughter has truly and irrevocably died. In fact, the irrevocable character of her loss is an essential starting point for the poem's dramatic conflict. So far as the narrator is concerned, and except for the brief moment of dream vision, she is lost beyond all possibility of earthly recovery. V Thus, in Pearl, a father is at first afflicted by a condition of personal loss that is thrust upon him; gradually, this situation shifts to one in which he is able to accept his fate and, more importantly, to render his "perle" back to God with positive sacrificial intent. Impetus for the change is clearly provided by the Dreamer's extraordinary vision experience. And having been granted temporary commerce with the transcendent, he approaches his waking, voluntary commitment with a new, sacramental understanding of sense experience, human love, and the natural world. But that his visionary moment is to be understood as a genuine experience of mystical ecstasy achieved through spiritual discipline, as a saint's visio in the traditional sense, seems doubtful in the light of lines 1189-98. Another explanation is possible, however, if we take into account some basic features of the dream- vision convention. The device allowed a medieval writer to record, in a character- 29/As this second element in the commixtio interpretation stresses the unity of the Church's and Christ's sacrifice, the theme of joint sacrifice could be part of the intended meaning behind the blood and water symbolism in Pearl; in this light, cf. lines 661-64, immediately following. 30/Louis Blenkner (n.7 above), pp. 70-71. 31/Cf. a passage from "How a Man Should Hear His Mass" (in The Lay Folks Mass-Book [n. 23 above], p. 128): "Hit is ful nedful to alle menne, / To more and eke to lasse. / 3ong &amp; olde.

Given this convention, lines 62-63, My body on balke per bod in sweuen. My goste is gon in Gode3 grace... do not argue a strict mind-body distinction, but describe a decisive moment in which grace has been apprehended. Indeed, whatever else might be said about the Dreamer's revelatory experience, it is foremost an occasion of divine grace, and therefore related to the Christian's ordinary experience of the sacraments. Despite its many liturgical resonances, and the significant role liturgical elements play in it, the poem is not primarily about the Mass, or a hidden allegory of the Eucharist. Most basically, it is the account of a father's efforts to come to personal terms with his child's early death. At the same time, its concerns extend to the narrator's confrontation of his own mortality, his own spiritual life. Neverthe- less, the psychic transformation of this bereaved father proceeds on the basis of principles that were, in the minds of the poet's contemporary Christian audience, rooted inevitably in the Liturgy of the Mass. We have seen how a thoroughly prepared attitude of mind, one imbued with a spirit of surrender and unstinted sacrifice, should accompany the visible offertory in the Mass, and how the process of arriving at this same attitude figures in the narrator's final active disposition in Pearl. Another way the Mass might have served as an inspirational model for the poem, using the multiple "peny" correspondences as our chief wedge to inter- pretation, is through the paradigmatic symbolism and transmutation process set forth in the Liturgy of the Eucharist. Eucharist transformation patterns help to illuminate the Pearl poet's literary application of transformational imagery, which accompanies transmutations from sorrow to joy, loss to gain, natural fatherly love to Christlike sacrificial love, and death to life. Without aiming at a precise classification of the poem with regard to literary genre, I should argue at least that it is not as a whole a pure instance of the Christian consolatio, as has sometimes been maintained. Admittedly, the ritualistic inter- pretation attempted here may be seen to draw upon the consolatio related, op- portunitas mortis theme. And in some respects, Pearl might be legitimately termed a consolatio. But it is, at the same time, considerably more than that. In its closing and climactic mood, it recalls much less a topic of the consolatio mortis argument than it does Abraham's willing sacrifice of his child and the spirit of actions such as those remembered in the liturgical prayer, Supra quae: " ... accepta habere [the sacrificial offerings], sicuti accepta habere dignatus es munera pueri tui justi Abel, et sacrific- ium patriarchae nostri Abrahae: et quod tibi obtulit summus sacerdos tuus Mel- chisedech, sactum sacrificium, immaculatam hostiam"32 (accept [these gifts], even as Thou didst graciously hold accepted the gifts of Thy just servant Abel, the sacrifice of our Patriarch Abraham and that which Thy high priest Melchisedech offered to Thee, a holy sacrifice, an unblemished victim).
