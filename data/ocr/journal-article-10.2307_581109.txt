<plain_text><page sequence="1">PRINCIPAL ACQUISITIONS BY THE CYPRUS MUSEUMS, 1969-76 In 'Archaeology in Cyprus, 1969-1976' (AR 1975-76 34-69) we described the various activities of the Department of Antiquities during these years, except for the Museums, which are dealt with in the present contribution. This section is mainly concerned with the principal acquisitions of the Cyprus Museum and the District Museums in the island. The rearrangement and renovation of the exhibi- tion galleries of the Cyprus Museum continued throughout these years. The exhibition in the Sep- timius Severus gallery has been rearranged and is now entirely assigned to sculpture of the Graeco- Roman period only. Gallery VII has also been re- arranged; all the sculpture has been removed to other galleries and it is now assigned to metal ex- hibits, including a mines section, to seals, coins, jewellery, glass, lamps and other minor works of art. Galleries I and II with the Neolithic and Early Bronze Age exhibits were also renovated. In 1972 two new Galleries were opened to the public with exhibits from the royal necropolis of Salamis and from the recent excavations at the Late Bronze Age sites of Enkomi and Kition. New lighting has been installed throughout the public galleries. This is true also for the Archaeological District and Site Museums. Other than the renovation and reorganization of the old museums new ones were opened in Larnaca and Limassol, both District Museums, and in Episkopi village (Kourion Museum) and Kouklia village (Palaipaphos Museum), both Site Museums. A folk-art museum was also opened at Kyrenia. Finds from the Kyrenia shipwreck were exhibited in Kyrenia Castle. The restoration of the ship itself was completed and arrangements were made for its final exhibition when the war broke out. In all the above Museums new storerooms were also built and adequately furnished. References to Museum inventory numbers are made as follows: CM: Cyprus Museum; Kyr.
