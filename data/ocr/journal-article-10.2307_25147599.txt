<plain_text><page sequence="1">ON THE COVER Science Advancing Mankind CHERYL R. GANZ Visitors to the 1933 Chicago World's Fair could not help but be impressed by the imposing Fountain of Science in the open air rotunda of the main entrance at the Hall of Science. Fair planners had placed the Hall of Science at the focal point in the fairgrounds in order to showcase the fair's theme, "A Century of Progress," through the hall's architecture, sculpture, murals, and exhibits. The fountain could be viewed from the outdoor terrace on the main level, from the rotunda on the ground level, and from the Sky Ride rocket cars traversing above. As a promotional flyer explained, "the theme of this fountain?Science Advancing Mankind?is represented by the great robot-like figure typifying the exactitude, force and onward movement of science, with its powerful hands at the backs of the figures of a man and a woman, representing mankind." The robot, man, and woman stood on a pedestal surrounded by a pool of water, with eight smaller pools below. At the base of each pool was a relief panel portraying one of the basic sciences: astronomy, mathematics, physics, chemistry, botany, zoology, medicine, and geology. The sculpture and the panels provided fairgoers with an inter pretive vision of the origins of science and its role in modern American society. Amazingly, fair officials gave the responsibility of executing this pivotal artistic endeavor to a local woman sculptor. Louise Lentz Woodruff had studied at Columbia University and at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Her artistic mentors included Lorado Taft, who taught many aspiring women artists in Chicago, and Emile Antoine Bourdelle, of Paris. Bourdelle urged his students to seek essential truths and free themselves from superfluous ornamentation. Taft, whose Chicago studio had produced many works for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, was dedicated to the sculptural beautifi cation of Chicago. He believed that public sculptures captured the essence of the cultural ideas and ideals of those who collaborated to erect them. These views influenced Woodruff's own artistic vision and more mod ernist style.

She served on the boards of artistic and civic organizations, and he was treasurer of the 1933 Chicago World's Fair's board of trustees. These social connections, combined with fair officials' efforts to integrate exceptional women into selected positions within the fair organization, resulted in Woodruff's commission. Most of the artistic commissions offered to women at previous fairs had enhanced women's pavilions rather than main exhibition buildings or central gathering points. Since London's Great Exhibition of 1851, organizers of international expositions had promoted the idea of progress. Gradually, the vision of progress that exhibitions embodied expanded beyond the industrial arts to include social, economic, commercial, artistic, and spiritual advances. The intersection of science, industry, and progress was the motif running through the Chicago World's Fair of 1933-34. Fair officials linked exhibits by emphasizing the universality of science and eliminated competitive industrial exhibits in favor of cooperative displays of significant historical, scientific, and technological artifacts and events. The changing symboliza tion in exhibits, art, and architecture evident at Chicago, and in particular apparent in Woodruff's sculpture, reveal something of the shifting concep tions of and waning faith in the idea of progress. The juxtaposition of the aesthetic arts and the industrial arts at early world's fairs highlighted perceived contradictions between them?a per ception that would change with the development of industrial design. Monumental fountains were featured as examples of the successful combi nation of art and engineering. The union of aesthetics and hydraulics not only enlivened the fairgrounds but also embodied cultural ideals. Fountains demonstrated human efforts to conquer nature and use it to improve the quality of life. By the 1930s many Americans had come to hail a new age of science and industry, in which the machine symbolized social promise and art celebrated production and consumption. In the Fountain of Science, Woodruff linked "mankind" and the machine, connected art with science, and promoted industrial capitalism and scientific con sumerism. Perhaps the most conceptually daring of Woodruff's design ideas was her decision to portray Science as a robot. In the decade preceding the Chicago fair, science fiction, the arts, and expositions had featured per forming robots. Czech playwright Karel Capek's play R. U. R. and Fritz Lang's film Metropolis depicted robots as symbols of technology out of con trol. In contrast, Woodruff created an appealing, anthropomorphic mechanical figure. A male form, it reflects the American identification of science and technology with masculinity; larger than humans, its lines sug gest strength, precision, and reliability. Cast of white bronze, it perfectly matched the Hall of Science architecture: massive, symmetrical, and con structed of geometric planes. 785</page><page sequence="4">TECHNOLOGY AND CULTURE OCTOBER 2000 VOL. 41 Science, the dominating figure in the sculpture, bends forward, "advancing" with slow, automated steps. This impression of labored for ward movement is especially appropriate since the word robata, or "robot," which originated with Capek's play, means "forced labor" in the Czech lan guage. But Woodruff's robot is not in servitude to mankind. Rather, Science's powerful hands gently nudge the male and female humans on to a fuller life. It has lowered its head and shoulders as if to shield itself against those forces that fear and criticize scientific research and the applications of science. Science knows that progress will encounter more obstacles ahead?an expectation underlined by conditions in the fair's bankrupt host city during the Great Depression. Sculptures and fountains that depicted the themes of science and progress at earlier fairs included women as allegorical figures, not as indi viduals. Woodruff included a woman in her composition and made her equal to the male figure. With suffrage still a recent victory, women's strug gles to assert new and equal roles in American society had achieved a height ened profile, and although in reality women remained subordinate this effort was reflected in the fair. Woodruff's decision to link Egypt?the facial features of Woodruff's male and female figures are European, but the pair wear Egyptian clothing?with the origins of Western science was daring, since many scholars identified Greece as the source of Western science and progress. The opening of Tutankhamen's tomb in 1922 had ignited the pop ular imagination. American newspapers and magazines regularly ran photo essays portraying ancient Egyptian culture. Jewelry, furniture, architecture, advertising, and films featured Egyptian material culture, adapting Egyptian designs to fit the context of modern times. For Americans, Egypt symbolized immortality and represented achievement in the arts and sciences. Woodruff clothed the human figures in unadorned sashes, looped around the waist, long flowing ends hanging down, worn without collars or other symbols of the royal context?that is, in the dress of laborers. These were the men and women who worked in the various crafts and sciences. This theme is developed further in the relief panels, which depict men and women interacting with nature: as humans expanded their knowledge of science, they also produced and consumed riches from nature. The bent limbs and swirling organic lines create an enwombed space that comple mented the encapsulating open rotunda setting of the fountain. Just as the cradle of civilization gave birth to science, so the fair gave birth to a new ideology of science and progress. These images in the Fountain of Science emphasize that parallel relationship and link production to reproduction. Fairgoers absorbed the idea of science as the deity of modern life in what fair literature often referred to as the temple of science. In Woodruff's sculpture, the human figures are poised with their arms and hands held upward, unsure of what awaits. Their eyes are wide open, yet they advance blindly into the future. The three figures look neither at each other nor at 7S6</page><page sequence="5">GANZ I Science Advancing Mankind ON THE COVER the viewer, and the expressionless faces of the man and woman reveal nei ther fear nor that state of happiness yet to be realized. They are reminiscent of Masaccio's Expulsion of Adam and Eve and Michelangelo's Fall and Expulsion from Paradise?but in those paintings an angel guides and pro tects the couple as they exit the Garden of Eden to go forth into the unknown. Woodruff's figures embody the fair's motto: "Science Finds, Industry Applies, Man Conforms." This slogan represented a shift from the earlier progress rhetoric with respect to the role of mankind. The Enlightenment's aggressive conqueror of nature had become a passive subject to science and technology. Science now constituted the autonomous force of progress, continually advancing humanity in economic, social, and cultural ways, its authority firmly established. The roles of humans and robots, intellect and forced labor, had been reversed. There is, however, a curious postscript to the story. After the fair closed, Woodruff donated her sculpture to Central High School in Joliet, an indus trial town southwest of Chicago. With the sculpture removed from the fountain and its original setting, the figures were brought down from their pedestal. Months later the school held a "name your team" contest. Three students submitted the winning entry: "Steelmen." One of the contest win ners explained that she chose "Steelmen" to signify that the school sports men played like men of steel and to reflect the city's most prominent indus try; Joliet had been in the 1880s the largest producer of steel rails in the world, and although iron and steel manufacturing had ended with the Great Depression, two new mills revived the industry in the same year that Woodruff donated the sculpture and that the students renamed the sports teams. Within a few years, students were referring to the robot Science as "Steelman." Joliet students disassociated the robot from its symbolic depic tion of science advancing and figuratively isolated it from the human fig ures in the sculpture, so that the mechanical man alone became the school mascot. 787</page></plain_text>
