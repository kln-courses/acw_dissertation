<plain_text><page sequence="1">Athena Itonia at Koroneia (Boiotia) and in Cilicia CONSTANTINE LAGOS [PLATE 1] New evidence presented in this article suggests that two silver fractional issues previously assigned to Cilicia are more plausibly given to Koroneia in Boiotia.1 TYPE I Obv.: Boiotian shield with thunderbolt in centre, to 1., B;2 dotted border.

Many thanks also to John Casey, Basil Demetriadi and Philip Kinns for sharing with me their views on various topics covered in the article, to Bekircan Tahberer for information about coin finds in Cilicia, and to Pantelis Magoulas for some of the photography. The research was conducted in the British Museum during early 2000 when I held a cen- tenary grant of the British School at Athens. 2 The letter is clear only on cat. no. 4 below. The 'star' symbol recorded by G.F. Hill left of the shield on BMC Lycaonia, etc, p. 175, 79 (cat. no. 1) is merely a scratch on the coin. Some coins of Type I, e.g. cat. no. 3, have no visible traces of a letter or symbol 1. of the shield and may not have had any such feature. B appears on the right of the shield on the associated Type II (see below). I am indebted to Mr. Ashton for pointing out to me the important fact that the shield on Types I and II is on the obverse, not, as all previous catalogues state, the reverse.</page><page sequence="2">2 C. LAGOS 6. SNG Levante , Cilicia, 119; 0.70 g. 7. SWG France 2, Cilicia, 476; 0.64 g The usual attribution of Type I to Cilicia or to Tarsos in particular is based on the bust of Athena on its reverse which is very similar to the obverse type of double sigloi struck at Tarsos after Alexander the Great conquered the city in 332 BC (PL 1, 6). These are thought to have been introduced by Balakros, the first gov- ernor of Cilicia appointed by Alexander, and to have continued under succeeding governors until 318 bc.4 However, the obverse of Type I seems out of place in Cilicia. The shield is not of the Macedonian type, as we would have expected from an issue struck in Cilicia under Macedonian rule, but Boiotian, with its char- acteristic figure of eight shape.5 The only mints known to have struck coinage with a Boiotian shield as a type are in Boiotia, apart from a bronze issue of Salamis ( BMC Attica 1-17) whose legendary hero Ajax probably carried a Boiotian shield.6 In all these cases the shield is on the obverse. Moreover, Type I is closely linked to the following fractional issue, here called Type II, which is often attributed to Boiotia. 3 This coin was recently found by myself while walking in a park close to the Athens University campus. The area is a low spur off the west of mount Hymettos between the modern districts of Zografou to the north and Kaisariani to the south. In a recent archaeological survey it is termed 'Theology Ridge' after the building housing the Theology School on its north side: see Merle K. Langdon, 'Hymettiana III: The Boundary Markers of Alepovouni', Hesperia 68, 4, (Oct.-Dec., 1999), pp. 481-508 at 503-4. The park is crossed by a few footpaths with rough-built terraces on one side (one illustrated by Langdon, p. 505, fig. 22). Archaeologists are uncertain how ancient the terraces are, but agree that they were probably erected by farmers for holding back the soil (Langdon, p. 504, suggests that the terraces may be ancient by referring to I. Dekoulakou, ad 38 (1983), Bl, p. 46, who considers them ancient but is uncertain when they were erected). The coin was found after rain beside one such footpath, a few hundred metres south of the Theology School. Some small sherds of pottery, tiles, and rubble suggesting the presence of ancient foundations were also noted. No antiquities appear to have been found during modern construction on different parts of this ridge, and Langdon's survey yielded only two horoi, probably of Roman period, inscribed in the rock surface, and no evidence of habitation. It would appear that in antiquity the area was primarily agricultural, not residential. 4 Numismatists have in the past attributed them to Mazaios, satrap of Cilicia shortly before Alexander's conquest (BMC Lycaonia, etc., p. 175; Traité //, pp. 463-4, no. 719; HN2, p. 732). H.H. Howorth, 'A note on some coins generally attributed to Mazaios, the Satrap of Cilicia and Syria', NC 4th series V. H, (1902), pp. 81-7, was the first to propose that all issues were struck by Balakros and his successors down to 318 bc. He suggested that the letter B on some of these coins should be read as part of the name B[AAAKPOI], instead of BfAIIAEYZ] as proposed by others. The discovery of a unique coin bearing the legend BAAAKPOY (SNG von Aulock 5965) and sharing the same obverse die with other issues of this type confirmed Howorth' s attribution. Today these issues are generally dated shortly after Alexander's conquest, and a few are attributed to other Cilician mints such as Mallos, Issus and Soli; see Kraay, ACGC, p. 284. 5 Babelon, Traite //, pp. 463-4, no. 719, alone describes the shape of the shield on this issue as 'being like that of Boiotia'. Hill, BMC Lycaonia etc, p. 175, 79, records it only as 'shield', and most other references have it simply as an 'oval' shield. 6 L.

Coins of Types I and II thus share the same types, a common denomination - perhaps an obol, with coins weighing between 0.60 and 0.80 g, and are struck on thin, spread, flans of 11-12 mm diameter, and poor quality of silver.8 1 have not detected any die-links between the two types, but they each have at least two dis- tinctive shield designs in common, suggesting that dies of the two different types may have been prepared by the same artist.9 There seems little doubt that they are close in date and from the same mint. Babelon ( Traité III , pp. 311-12) attributed Type II to Boiotia and proposed as its mint Thespiae, which became one of the political centres of the Boiotian League after 338 bc, when he considered this issue was struck (see below). He regarded the letter B as the initial of the Boiotian 7 Some specimens show no trace of a thunderbolt, and may not have had this feature: see Pl. 1, 11. 8 The poor quality of silver of these issues was noted by Svoronos who records as 'bronze based' silver the coin in Helen Mavrogordato's collection. Of the coins I have studied none has a bronze core, but the quality of silver appears to be poor. The thinness of these coins is evident from specimens which have parts of their flan clipped or broken off (e.g. Pl. 1, 2 and 11). 9 Compare firstly SNG Levante , Cilicia 119 (here Type I, no. 6) with 123 (here Type II, no. 3) and with BM 1982-9-35-5 (here Type II, no. 8 and Pl. 1, 11).

LAGOS League, BOlílTílN, for he did not know of the single coin (type II, no. 8) with the letters B-A. His attribution was followed by Forrer who assigned Weber 3331 (here type II, no. 2) to an 'unknown mint of Boiotia'. Levante ( SNG Levante , Cilicia, p. 6) was the first to associate type II with type I, assigning both to Tarsos, and interpreted the letter on the obverse as the initial of Balakros. However, the same scholar classified specimens of these issues in his publication of SNG France 2, Cilicia, as uncertain (nos 489a-b, here type II, nos 4-5). In the British Museum trays type II, nos. 1 and 2 are placed under Boiotia, type II, no. 8 under Tarsos. Svoronos was equally ambivalent, since he published the coin in the Helen Mavrogordato collection (here type II, no. 9) as Koroneia, but noted in parenthesis that a mint in Asia Minor seemed more probable. The only recorded provenances do not resolve the matter. Two coins of type I have secure find- spots, one in Cilicia (type I, no. 4), the other near Athens (type I, no. 2). BM 1884-6-10-8 (type I, no. 1) was supplied by Paul Lambros, an Athens-based dealer, and Weber 3331 (type II, no. 2) was acquired in Athens in 1897; on the other hand BM 1928-9-2-3 (type II, no. 1) was bought from Zitelli, a dealer on Rhodes who supplied much Asiatic material to the market. A more persuasive factor for determining the attribution of types I and II is typology. As we saw, the use of the Boiotian shield as a coin type strongly sug- gests Boiotia, and there is further typological evidence to support this. Shortly before 374 bc Koroneia in Boiotia struck two extremely rare issues of silver obols, with Boiotian shield on the obverse, and on the reverse, respectively, a fac- ing bust of Athena (PI. 1, 12-13), and a profile bust of Athena r. (PI. 1, 14). Both reverse types bear the ethnic K-O.10 The two issues are die-linked and must have been more or less contemporary.11 Their obverses and reverses are identical in type, if not style, to the obverses and reverses of our types I and II, and the denomination may have been the same for both coinages.12 This suggests that types I and II were struck at Koroneia. DATE OF TYPES I AND II Although our types I and II are closely linked to the Koroneian 'Athena' obols in type and denominational value, they do not seem to belong to the same period. In the first place, their thin, spread, flans with diameters of 11-12 mm are markedly different from the thick flans with rounded edges and diameters of 10 For these obols, see B.V. Head, On the Chronological Sequence of the Coins ofBoeotia (London, 1881), pp. 45-6; they are generally dated c.387-374 bc, and certainly before 364 when Thebes appears to have destroyed Koroneia (Head, loc. cit.). The coins illustrated at Pl. 1, 12 and 14 are in the BM C BMC Central Greece , p. 47, 12-13); Pl. 1, 13 is in a private collection. 11 The obverse die of BMC Central Greece , p. 47, no. 12 (frontal bust) is the same as BMC Central Greece , p. 47, no. 13 (bust r.). 12 Recorded weights of the Koroneian obols range between 0.73-0.88 g., slightly heavier than the combined average weight of 0.65 g for Types I and H.</page><page sequence="5">ATHENA ITONIA AT KORONEIA (BOIOTIA) AND IN CILICIA 5 8-11 mm used for the Koroneian 'Athena' obols, and are more characteristic of issues of the early Hellenistic period onwards.13 An early Hellenistic date for Types I and II is also suggested by a stylistic fea- ture of these issues. On the shield used for both types the two indentations in the outer edge, which are characteristic of the Boiotian shield, are restricted to the shield's rim. This is slightly different from the form appearing on all issues of Boiotia of the Classical period (including the Koroneian 'Athena' obols: see the obverses of Pl. 1, 12-14) where the indentations go well into the shield's body. Only on Boiotian issues traditionally dated after 338 bc (Head, Boiotian Coinage , p. 76) do we come across Boiotian shields with the indentations restricted to the rim, for example the large bronze coins of Haliartos and other Boiotian cities (PL 1, 15), whose shield is very similar to that on coins of Types I and II (compare Pl. 1, 3 and 7). A similar shield also appears on some of the small bronze coins of the Boiotian League with types Boiotian shield/trident, issued between 338/5 and the early third century bc.14 This typological detail suggests that Types I and II may have been issued after 338 bc and close in date to the above bronze coinages. This proposed terminus post quem is supported by historical considerations. In 364 bc Koroneia appears to have lost its freedom, or even been destroyed, and had its territory seized by Thebes.15 However in the late fourth century bc, the city reemerged, probably shortly after 338 bc, when Thebes lost control of Boiotia.16 Thus, any coinage struck at Koroneia after 364 bc would probably date at the earliest to 338 bc. TVpe II, cat no. 8, may provide us with a clue for dating these issues with some precision. As we saw, this coin bears the letter B to the right of the shield and A to the left.17 In the early Hellenistic period, these initials were extensively used by the Macedonian kings on their coinage to signify BA[XIAEilI], B[AUAEflI]- A[AEZANAPOY], or B[AXIAEni]-A[NTirONOY]. The ruler who made by far the great- est use of these initials was Demetrios Poliorketes who controlled Boiotia in 304/3-301 and 294-288 bc. He also appears to have struck some of his own regal 13 O.

Roesch, Etudes Béotiennes (Paris, 1982), p. 424, notes a citizen of Koroneia named in a late fourth century bc inscription as a federal magistrate of the Boiotian League. During the period 378-338 not a single person is recorded in an inscription as citizen of Koroneia, but three are named in inscriptions of the period 338-288: see P. Roesch, 'La Citoyenneté Féderale en Béotie', Teiresias Suppl. 2 (1979), pp. 27-31, at p. 28. 17 The letters on this issue are clearly part of the type. They are not traces of an undertype, as was the case with bronzes of the Boiotian League struck during the late third century bc on Macedonian coins carrying the letters B-A in their reverse types: see T. Hackens, 'La Circulation Monétaire dans la Béotie Hellénistique: Trésors de Thebes 1935 et 1965', BCH 93 (1969), pp. 701-29, at p. 717, nos 21-33.</page><page sequence="6">6 C. LAGOS coinage in Boiotia, at the mint of Thebes.18 Discounting the period 292-290 when Boiotia was in revolt against him, I would suggest placing Type II in one of these two periods. If Type II is indeed linked to Poliorketes, then it and its near con- temporary Type I will date to a period when silver Boiotian coinage appears to have been scarce or even non-existent.19 A REPRESENTATION OF THE ATHENA ITONIA BY AGORAKRITOS? The Athena bust on the early fourth century obols of Koroneia has long been identified as Athena Itonia (Head, Boiotian Coinage, p. 45; Babelon, Traité III, pp. 264-5), whose temple (the Itonion) near Koroneia played an important role in the Boiotian League.20 The identification is now confirmed by the letters IT [nislIA] on the reverse of one of the early fourth century Koroneian 4 Athena' obols (Pl. 1, 13, where the letters are visible below left of the bust). Pausanias (9, 34, 1) saw in the Itonion of Koroneia a cult statue of Athena Itonia,21 by the fifth century artist Agorakritos of Paros, and it is likely that the highly unusual frontal bust of Athena represented on the local coinage copies that of the cult statue. A skyphos of the Roman period found during the 1971-2 excavation of an ancient sanctuary near the acropolis of Koroneia which is likely to be the Itonion bears an engraved bust of Athena which the excavator, Th. Spyropoulos, believes to have been copied from Agorakritos's statue of Athena Itonia. No illustration of this bust is available, but Spyropoulos' description shows it to match the frontal bust of Athena of the type discussed here: 'the bust is in a circle made of a line ... it shows a young woman ... her hair falls as if tied to her shoulders ... on her head she wears an Attic helmet with three crests and uplifted cheek-pieces ... at the base of the neck the bust bears a necklace depicted as a dotted circle ... the helmet does not affect the peaceful, calm representation ... the bust is slightly 18 E.T. Newell, The Coinages of Demetrios Poliorketes , (London, 1927), pp. 126-30, considers his issues 139-42 as struck at Thebes. For the history of Thebes in this period, see Roesch, Etudes Béotiennes , pp. 427-38 19 The chronology of Boiotian silver coinage after 335 bc is far from certain (M0rkholm, Early Hellenistic Coinage , p. 81). The shield/amphora silver series of the Boiotian League {BMC Central Greece , pp. 36-7, nos 42-50) is traditionally dated c. 3 3 8/5-3 15 bc (Head, Boiotian Coinage , pp. 75-9) and after its cessation the only silver coinage attributed to Boiotia bears foreign types of Poliorketes or Alexander. T.R. Martin, Sovereignty and Coinage in Classical Greece (Princeton, 1985), pp. 169-70, suggests that no silver coinage with local types was issued in Boiotia after 335 until well into the third century bc. 20 For the political importance of the Itonion in the Boiotian League, see Babelon, Traité III , p. 264; A. Schachter, Cults of Boiotia, 1. Acheloos-Hera, BICS no. 38.1 (London, 1981), pp. 124-6; Roesch, Etudes Béotiennes , p. 222. Representatives of different cities met there to decide on the League's affairs (Pausanias 9.34), and their edicts were set up there {IG 9.1.170 of c.301 bc). The Pamboiotoian games were held close to the Itonion (Schachter, Cults of Boiotia. pp. 122-3). 21 This statue was set up in the Itonion alongside one of Zeus (Pausanias, loc. cit.), or Hades (Strabo, 9.2.29[411]).</page><page sequence="7">ATHENA ITONIA AT KORONEIA (BOIOTIA) AND IN CILICIA 7 turned to the right.'22 Spyropoulos was not aware of the similarity between his find and the frontal bust on the coinage of Koroneia, but it seems likely that this type of bust had become the standard representation of the Boiotian Athena Itonia.23 The early fourth century bc date of the first Koroneian 'Athena' obols is a few decades earlier than that of the identical bust on the double sigloi of Tarsos.24 It comes as no surprise that a Cilician mint should have copied a type from Koroneia, since mints of this region extensively copied Greek coin types starting from the early fourth century bc.25 If the Athena bust used by the mint at Tarsos is that of the Boiotian Itonia, we have the opportunity to find out what the statue of Athena Itonia by Agorakritos looked like. For, as Imhoof-Blumer noted, the bust of Athena on the Tarsos dou- ble sigloi is very similar to the top of a full-length statue represented on another Cilician coin, a stater probably belonging to Aphrodisias26 (see PL 1, 17, and enlarged details at Pl. 1, 1827). Here Athena is portrayed with her left hand sup- 22 Th.

For the probable identification of the site as the Itonion, see most recently P. Krentz, 'Athena Itonia and the battle of Koroneia' in H. Bister and J. Buckler (eds), BOIOTIKA. Vorträge vom 5. Internationalen Böotien- Kolloquium zu Ehren von Pr. Dr Siegfried Lauffer (Munich, 1989), pp. 313-17. 23 L. Lacroix, Les Reproductions de Statues sur les Monnaies Grecques (Liège, 1949), p. 270, con- siders that the frontal bust of Athena on the Koroneian obol was influenced by that on the Syracusan decadrachm by Eukleidas. Similarly, Howorth, pp. 83-4, records the opinion of Hill that the Athena bust on the Tarsos double sigloi was copied from Syracusan decadrachms. The positioning of the bust three quarter facing 1. may indeed have been influenced by the Syracusan coins, as were many other types in Greece during the fourth century bc. However, the Syracusan bust differs from the Koroneian and Tarsiot in having a helmet with a single crest - not three as at Koroneia and Tarsos - for what look like two further crests are the uplifted cheekpieces (see the enlargement at PL 1, 16). A few fourth century coin types show a bust of Athena identical to that on the coins of Koroneia and Tarsos: Pale (bronze; Traité //, 3, no. 1261), Phokis (bronze; SNG Copenhagen 113-18), Tegea (bronze; BMC Peloponnesus , p. 202, 14), and Lesbos (electrum; Traité //, 2, no. 2190). Some of these mints may have simply copied the type without heeding its significance, but neighbouring Phokis will probably have chosen it deliberately as a representation of the Boiotian Itonia. The Phokians occupied the Itonion in 352-346 bc during the Third Sacred War (Diodoros 16.57, 4-58), and a later inscription (IG 7.3426) records that a chief priestess of Athena Itonia of Koroneia also held a priesthood of the Phokian League. 24 Earlier numismatists were unaware of the close link between the Athena busts at Tarsos and Koroneia, and most identified the Athena of the Tarsos double sigloi as the Anatolian Athena Magarsia (e.g. Traité II, pp. 463-4). This was disproved by A. Houghton, 'The Seleucid Mint of Mallus and the Cult Figure of Athena Magarsia' in A. Houghton et al. (eds), Studies in Honor of Leo Mildenberg (Wetteren, 1984), pp. 91-110, who pointed out the differences between the bust of the Magarsia type and that of the Tarsos double sigloi, and concluded that the latter is typically Greek (p. 105, n. 34). 25 I.

LAGOS porting a shield, and in the opened palm of her outstretched right hand she holds a small statue of Nike which leans towards her holding a garland in her hands. This depiction has some features in common with what is known of the cult statue of Athena Itonia of Koroneia from epigraphic and literary sources. A herm discovered in the Itonion excavation was inscribed with a prayer to Nike,28 show- ing that she was worshipped alongside Athena in the temple. There is some evi- dence that a serpent was closely linked to the Boiotian Itonia and considered as her consort.29 Its absence from the Aphrodisias type is explicable, if this repre- sents the cult statue of Boiotian Itonia, since Agorakritos appears to have trans- formed the snake into an anthropomorphic image when he created a statue of Zeus (or Hades) alongside that of Athena (Schachter, Cults ofBoiotia , p. 120). By contrast, the serpent which was associated with the Athena Parthenos type was never absent (see below). The statue of Athena Itonia is generally thought to have represented a peaceful deity of chthonic character, unlike the martial depiction of her namesake in Thessaly, from which the Boiotian type originated.30 The statue depicted on the Aphrodisias stater is certainly peaceful, with a calm face and a relaxed posture. Athena wears a helmet which is more decorative than practical and holds the shield away from her body in non-threatening fashion. Nike crowns Athena with a garland of flowers, instead of the laurel wreath of military victory. Many scholars have identified the Aphrodisias statue as a representation of the Athena Parthenos of Pheidias.31 In both cases Athena holds a shield in her left hand and a small statue of Nike in her right, and the clothing is identical. There are, however, some important differences. The top of the helmet of Parthenos is decorated with pegasoi or griffins and a sphinx in the middle crest (Pausanias I. 24. 5; Lacroix, Reproductions de Statues , pp. 266-7), while the bust of the Aphrodisias type, details of which are visible on the Tarsos and Koroneia issues, wears a simple helmet with plain crests and has a necklace at the base of the neck. This statue type also lacks some of the fundamental features of the Parthenos type, such as the spear and serpent. The absence of the snake would have been 28 Spyropoulos, Ath. Ann.

For the Thessalian origin of Athena Itonia, see Ure, 'Boiotian Vases' p. 168; the Thessalian Athena Itonia appears on coins of the Thessalian League of the second century bc in martial guise, brandishing a spear and shield: see B. Helly, 'Le groupe des monnaies fédérales Thessaliennes avec Athena aux pompons', RN 1966, pp. 7-32. 31 Dinsmoor, 'Athena Parthenos', p. 104; Imhoof-Blumer, Monnaies Grecques , p. 374, no. 47; Babelon, Collection De Luynes , pp. 77-8, and others. The Athena Parthenos is known from copies of the Roman period, and representations on coins, medallions, jewelry, etc: see Dinsmoor, 'Athena Parthenos', pp. 103-4; G.P. Stevens, 'Concerning the Parthenos', Hesperia XXX, 1 (1961), pp. 1-7 (Pl. 1) at pp. 2-3.</page><page sequence="9">ATHENA ITONIA AT KORONEIA (BOIOTIA) AND IN CILICIA 9 particularly odd if this statue was of the Parthenos type, since it represented Erechtheus, an important figure in the cult.32 Furthermore, on the Aphrodisias type the right hand of Athena holding Nike is supported by the trunk of an olive tree, and Nike leans towards Athena as if fly- ing, and holds a garland in both hands. In contrast, the Parthenos statue shows Athena's right hand unsupported, with Nike standing to attention and holding a laurel wreath in one uplifted hand (Hill, BMC Lycaonia, etc , pp. xlii-xliii). It could be argued that some of these differences were simply due to inattention on the part of the Cilician die-engraver, but the support in the form of an olive-stump under the statue's right hand is difficult to explain away in this manner; it would have played a practical role in the real statue (Hill, loc. cit.; Lacroix, Reproductions de Statues , pp. 273-4).33 Hill (loc. cit.) noticed the differences between the Athena Parthenos and the Aphrodisias type and considered that the latter depicted not the statue of Athena Parthenos itself, but another statue, 'an early copy or an adaption of Athena Parthenos made by an artist who was not able to dispense with the support'. Lacroix ( Reproductions de Statues , p. 276) also regarded the Cilician type as a representation not of the Athena Parthenos of Pheidias, but of another statue made by a local artist in Cilicia imitating the Parthenos.34 The Aphrodisias type is in the Pheidian style, with clothing identical to that of Athena Parthenos: the originals must have been roughly contemporary. This lends further support to the suggestion that the statue depicted was by Agorakritos. He was a student of Pheidias (Pausanias 9.34.1), and almost certainly worked with him on the Parthenon,35 perhaps on the Athena Parthenos statue, which might have been used as a model for his own statue of Itonia. Parts of Agorakritos's only other known statue, that of Nemesis at her sanctuary at Rhamnous, have been identified by Despinis, and his reconstruction shows that it is in the Pheidian 32 The absence of the Erechtheus snake from this type is noted by Hill, BMC Lycaonia , etc, pp. xlii-xliii; for its importance as guardian of the Athenian Akropolis, see Pausanias (I. 24); D.M. Robinson, 'Two Corinthian Copies of the Head of the Athena Parthenos', AJA XV (1911), pp. 482-503 at p. 483. 33 Nike's forward-leaning stance would have increased the weight on the statue's right hand, neces- sitating the introduction of the olive stump as a support. On the original statue of Athena Parthenos, Nike stands upright in the palm of Athena's hand and does not need to be supported (Hill, loc. cit.). Some copies of the Parthenos statue of the Roman Imperial period show a support under the statue's hand in the form of a column, but these date a few centuries after Pheidias's statue. They may have copied a late Hellenistic replacement for the original Parthenos which appears to have been burnt down during the second century bc (Dinsmoor, loc. cit.). It is almost certain that when the Aphrodisias stater was issued the right hand of the Athena Parthenos statue did not have a support. Kraay, A CGC, p. 280, suggests that the olive stump on the Aphrodisias type might symbolize the sacred olive on the Akropolis; this is unlikely since no such feature existed on the Parthenos statue itself; on p. 283, n. 2, Kraay suggests that the olive stump was merely a support for the statue's hand. 34 Both Hill and Lacroix were unaware of the differences between the busts of the statues of Parthenos and Aphrodisias types. 35 Despinis, Study of Agorakritos, pp. 124-32, considers some of the statues of the Parthenon metopes to be the work of Agorakritos, or artists working under his directions.</page><page sequence="10">10 C. LAGOS style.36 The only known numismatic representation of this statue is probably on a stater struck at Paphos, Cyprus, in c.375 bc.37 This stater is roughly contemproary with that of Aphrodisias. If these types indeed represent works of Agorakritos, it would seem that he enjoyed some popularity in Cilicia and Cyprus during the early fourth century bc. Despinis {Study of Agorakritos , pp. 146-55) has proposed identifying Agorakritos's statue of Athena Itonia as that of the 'Hope-Farnese' type, known from a Roman copy. This statue has a similar posture and general appearance to that of the Aphrodisias type. However the outstretched hand of Athena is slightly closed, showing that it was grasping an object - a phiale, according to Despinis - and not supporting a statue of Nike, which as we saw is likely to have been an attribute of Itonia of Koroneia. Her helmet is different from that of the frontal Athena bust on the obols of Koroneia, and decorated with pegasoi at the top, even though Despinis (loc. cit.) claims a general resemblance. The identification with the coin-types of Koroneia, Tarsos and Aphrodisias seems better to fit the evi- dence. This conclusion would of course hold true even if, against the view argued in this article, the obols of Type I and II prove to be after all of Cilician origin. Postscript. After this article went to press, I noted a further example of a Type I obol at Classical Numismatic Review 16/3 (1992), 115, 0.66 g. On this coin the letter A can be seen to the right of the shield, showing that, as with Type II, at least some coins of Type I had the obverse legend B-A. I in fact thought I had detected traces of A on the obverse of Type I, no. 1, but they were too faint to allow any degree of certainty. 36 See G. Despinis, 'Discovery of the Scattered Fragments and Recognition of the Type of Agorakritos' Statue of Nemesis', Ath. Ann. Arch. 3 (1970), pp. 403-14. 37 This was first proposed by J.-P. Six, 'Aphrodite-Nemesis', NC 1882, p. 89, and followed by later scholars (Hill, BMC Cyprus , p. lxxv; F. Imhoof-Blumer and P. Gardner, Ancient Coins Illustrating Lost Masterpieces of Greek Art, A Numismatic Commentary on Pausanias (repr. Chicago, 1964), p. 151; Traité //, 2, 796); contra, Lacroix, Reproductions de Statues , pp. 287-91, who claims the type represents Aphrodite.</page><page sequence="11">LAGOS, ATHENA ITONIA PLATE 1</page></plain_text>
