<plain_text><page sequence="1">MICHAEL SPITZER CONVERGENCES: CRITICISM, ANALYSIS AND BEETHOVEN RECEPTION To read a work as polemical as Scott Burnham's Beethoven Hero (1995)l is to ask, 'what is the question to which Burnham's book is the answer?' If theories of reception history, like aesthetic texts, possess an 'afterlife', then Beethoven Hero is a long-overdue response to a neglected yet ground-breaking essay that Hans Heinrich Eggebrecht wrote for the Beethoven bicentenary (Eggebrecht 1972). Trawling through two centuries of Beethoven reception, Eggebrecht noticed that critics as diverse as Marx, Riemann, Riezler, Bekker and Romain Rolland discussed the music in terms of a limited collection of expressive topoi, such as Einheit von Leben und Werk (unity of life and work), Leidensnotzoendigkeit (the necessity of suffering) and Zeitlosigkeit (timelessness). Eggebrecht arranged these 'reception-constants' as a 'concept-field' (p. 41), and extrapolated the composer's archetypal narrative scheme, a progression from 'the necessity of suffering', through 'will', leading to 'overcoming' ( Uberwindung) . In Eggebrecht's view, the entire critical literature could be 'contemplated, made use of, read and quoted from' as if it were 'one book written by a single author' (p. 38).2 Suggestive as it was of a fresh convergence between music criticism and historical hermenuetics, Eggebrecht's monograph fell between the two epistemological stools of the 1970s, the retreat from structuralism and the ascendancy of music analysis. Thus Dahlhaus, perhaps with one eye on Levi- Strauss's comparable reduction of the Oedipus myth, disposed of 'reception- constants' with a simple argument: 'cliches associated with major composers, works or oeuvres differ fundamentally and profoundly from each other, not only in their actual content but also in the very way they function as topoi or stereotyped opinions' (Dahlhaus 1985, p. 62). So-called 'constants' cannot be abstracted from changes in critical fashion. In the case of Wagner reception for example, the 'art as religion' topic was once admired but is now largely discredited. Conversely, from the standpoint of music analysis, Eggebrecht's approach (better known from his subsequent work on Bach) fell foul of Music Analysis, 1 6/iii (1997) 369 GI Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1997.

Beethoven Hero addresses and resolves these difficulties in a radical way. Firstly, Burnham asserts from the outset that the values of Beethoven's music, in particular of his 'heroic style', have remained largely the same: 'for nearly two centuries, a single style of a single composer has epitomized musical vitality, becoming the paradigm of Western compositional logic and of all the positive virtues that music can embody for humanity' (1995, p. xiii). Secondly, he charts the persistent influence of this style not across superficial apothegms or topoi but within fully-fledged analytical systems. Chapter 1 presents an overview of countless programmatic interpretations of the Eroica's first movement, and argues convincingly that critics as outwardly antithetical as A. B. Marx, Schenker and David Epstein are all responding to the same archetypal process in the music, albeit using different metalanguages: 'the trajectory of these stories is always the same, or nearly so: something (someone) not fully formed but full of potential ventures out into complexity and ramification (adversity), reaches a ne plus ultra (a crisis), and then returns renewed and completed (triumphant)' (p. 3). Chapter 3, the most impressive of the book, proposes that the theories of Marx, Riemann, Schenker and Reti all evolved in response to the qualities of Beethoven's heroic style, its 'uncanny sense of presence that is linear, continuous, weighty, and inexorable and that enlists the entire musical texture in its forward progress' (p. 66). The energy of Beethoven's music is represented in Marx's conflict of Gang and Satz; Schenker formulates the same principle in terms of the forward-impulse of the Urlinie. Burnham is able to demonstrate continuities between figurative and technical engagements with the music, between modern and historical receptions, in a way that leaves Eggebrecht far behind. And Burnham is not finished yet. Chapter 2 provides a working example of music phenomenology in action, as Burnham takes us through Beethoven's Fifth Symphony with an ear to its 'projection of experiential temporality' (p. 30), the music's ability to inspire such profound identification with the listener. Insofar as it is possible to bracket out all technical mediation, Burnham reveals the inherent qualities which prepossessed generations of critics, theorists and listeners. Chapter 4 argues that Beethoven's music enshrines and resolves conflicting cultural manifestations of the heroic, associated respectively with Hegel and Goethe; indeed, the heroic style sounds 'the deepest keynote of the age' (p. 118). Here Burnham adopts a cautionary tone, and exhorts us to move away from the Beethoven paradigm, to 'transcend the hegemony of Beethoven's heroic style'. With prose of sub-Foucauldian fustian, he counsels that 'it is time to dissolve the terms of this our happy thralldom, to forsake the comforts of our insular domain, place our sails in the way of new winds, and face the dangerous promise of an open sea' (p. 167).

Beethoven Hero combines reception history, theories of canon formation, cultural study, response theory, phenomenology and the history of analysis. Burnham marshals all these weapons, however, for a single cause. In his view, mainstream analysis, with its formalist and cognitive turns, is no longer adequate to engage with the irreducibly ethical dimension of music. To experience music as human subjects is more than 'processing' or 'tracking', or listening for 'hidden motivic relationships at the far ends of a long work' (p. 163). With a strong sense of nostalgia, he looks back to the programmatic interpretations of critics such as Marx as models of analysis which 'approach works of imagination with imagination': 'metaphors involving human actions engage the imagination more directly, overtly, and powerfully than those detailing faceless processes that are merely organic' (p. 8). Our reception of Beethoven Hero must therefore answer two important questions: are its convergent methodologies mutually coherent? and to what extent is Burnham's negative prognosis of modern analysis warranted? I shall argue that, in both respects, Burnham's position entails more problems than solutions. Burnham rushes through his 168 pages at such a cracking pace, and packs in so many ideas, that he leaves himself scarcely any space or time for exposition and discussion of method. This can in part be attributed to the book's general distaste for theorising about music. And the lack of an overt conceptual framework is masked by liberal footnoted citations from co- workers in the field (even, impressively, American PhDs still in progress). This certainly gives Beethoven Hero a thoroughly modern 'feel'. But for a book on reception history to avoid all mention of the Konstanz school of Gadamer and Jauss is most surprising, to put it mildly. And why does Burnham, the historian of theory, avail himself of none of the literature on the history and sociology of science? With a little care, however, the book's theoretical presuppositions can be reconstructed. In brief, Burnham's conflation of music phenomenology and music reception pivots on an implicit analogy between experiential time and historical time. As I shall show, the two conceptions of temporality actually pull in irreconcilable directions. As is well known, Husserl's idea of the intentional 'horizon' as the shifting frame of the thinking mind lends itself equally well to the phenomenology of time perception and the hermeneutics of historical context. Gadamer, for example, covers both aspects ofthe term in Truth andMethod (Gadamer 1975, pp. 217, 269), and Thomas Clifton conceives of the musical horizon as a 'temporal background', or the 'temporal edge of a single field, which itself may enclose a multitide of events interpreted by the experiencer as belonging to this field' (Clifton 1983,p.57). This groundedness in 'horizon' is echoed by Burnham's vivid description of what it is 'really like' to experience the MusicAnalysis, 16/iii (1997) Z3 Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1997</page><page sequence="4">372 MICHAEL SPITZER unpredicability of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony: 'there is no safe projection of the future; no longer can we see a long stretch of the road ahead. Instead we are forced, as it were, to drive at high speed with only the space immediately before us visible - this is indeed one form of living in the moment' (Burnham 1995, pp. 38-9). By contrast, Gary Tomlinson explains Gadamer's 'effective- historical consciousness' (Gadamer 1975, p. 267) as 'the ever-moving sense of the historical situatedness and connection of ourselves and our data': historians of past cultures should not attempt to disregard our presentist prejudices but, on the contrary, should 'understand our prejudices as the framework itself of our historical experience' (Tomlinson 1993, p. 21). Unless we accept our place in tradition, we will lose our connectedness to historical knowledge. Beethoven Hero also stresses the communality of our tradition with the cultural values of what Burnham styles the Goethezeit, the Age of Goethe. An emblematic theme of this period, according to Burnham, is captured at the close of Goethe's Dichtung und Wahrheit: 'As if whipped on by invisible spirits, the sun-steeds of time sweep the light chariot of our destiny along, and the most we can do is to maintain courage and calm, hold the reins tight, and steer the wheels to right or left ... Where we are headed, who knows? We hardly recall whence we came' (Burnham 1 995, p. 11 5). Now, though the two passages are 80 pages apart, it is clear that Burnham has modelled his phenomenological interpretation of the Fifth Symphony upon Goethe's thoroughly historical trope of 'the chariot of our destiny'. To be sure, the disciplines of phenomenology and historical hermeneutics both depend on circular and dynamic processes of understanding. In the former, this unfolds as a reciprocity of feeling and abstraction, a dialectic of immanence and transcendence through which phenomenal values or experiences appear to 'be immanent in, and emanate from, the musical object' (Clifton 1983, p. 295). In the latter, it takes the form of a dialogue becween temporal horizon and historical situatedness, distanciation and appropriation culminating in the 'filsion of horizons' where understanding is achieved. The crucial point is that, from its initial encounter, phenomenology is directed towards 'presences' and 'essences', 'immanence', 'familiarity', and interpreter/interpreted identi- fication; hermeneutics aspires to this condition only at the end of its negotiations, and begins from a position of estrangement. The 'music-ing self's' 'possession' by music is described by Clifton as 'the eradication of boundary' (p. 281), so that qualities such as 'tender' or 'tonal' are experienced as inhering both within the music and in ourselves. Moreover, this sense of immediate identification is felt before the play of difference sets in: 'the primordial level of phenomenal meaning aff1rms an essential oneness which precedes relation forming' (p. 46). In contrast, the whole project of historical hermeneutics was designed to help us understand the 'strangeness' of past customs, without, however, neutralising their 'otherness'. Burnham's MusicAnalysis, 16/iii (1997) t Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1997</page><page sequence="5">CRITICISM, ANALYSIS AND BEETHOVEN RECEPTION 373 phenomenological hermeneutics short-circuits this 'strangeness', on the dubious grounds that we still hear in the same way as Beethoven's contemporaries, and that we ought to hear this way. Thus, listening to Beethoven engenders no jolt of the unfamiliarity that Gadamer describes as 'the experience of being pulled up short by the text' (1975, p. 237). Rather, Burnham maintains that music induces a sense of the familiar: 'do we really return to experience the music we value in the hope and expectation of hearing something new each time? On the contrary, I believe we return because we hear nearly the same thing each time' (1995, p. 164). In his dismissal of difference and dialogue, Burnham remains curiously under the spell of the synchronic view of history tabulated in Eggebrecht's Begriffsfelder. Like Eggebrecht, though at a considerably more sophisticated level, Burnham reads Beethoven reception as 'one book written by a single author' (Eggebrecht 1972, p. 38). Indeed, Beethoven Hero, authored by Scott Burnham, is precisely such a book. Tomlinson calls this approach 'textualization' and associates it with the dissemination of Paul Ricoeur's thoughts in the early 1970s (Tomlinson 1993, p. 32). Ricoeur, as Tomlinson represents him, asserts the autonomy of the text in three ways: 'in its dissociation from the original audience for which it was made, in the opening out of its possible range of reference in the absence of the original situation of its creation, and in the exteriorization and fixation of meaning involved in its inscription' (p. 25). Tomlinson does not dismiss this approach as wrong so much as one-sided. He believes that the future of interpretation theory lies in the fruitful interaction of textualisation with dialogism. If so, then who are Burnham's natural interlocutors? He has two: in the field of music theory, Thomas Christensen; in cultural studies, Lawrence Kramer. Tomlinson recognises that historical consciousness is more complex than the phenomenological horizon: 'it seems to involve, at least transiently, multiple horizons' (p. 22). Christensen's Rameau and Musical Thought in the Enlightenment ( 1993) situates the theorist not by seeking any single encompassing definitions, but by representing Rameau's life-long work and his cultural context as a network of competing and overlapping trends: 'only by acknowledging and bringing out these many tensions and dissonances rather than repressing or resolving them can we begin to capture the full richness of eighteenth-century thought' (p. 19). Christensen recognises that Rameau's achievement, like Zarlino's before him, was to integrate musica pratica and musica theoretica into a coherent whole. But he emphasises that this synthesis was an ongoing struggle, not a fait accomplit. Nor does Christensen ignore the 'residual tensions' (p. 31) of Rameau's work. Christensen's correlation of Rameau's practical and conceptual sides with the contemporary debate between Newtonian empiricism and Cartesian rationalism is far from reductionist or dualistic. Burnham's tools seem rather blunt by comparison. MusicAnalysis, 16/iii (1997) t Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1997</page><page sequence="6">374 MICHAEL SPITZER Beethoven Hero does not have enough scope to provide anything more than snapshots of its theorists, but even here Burnham's instincts are to homogenise. There will be much more to say about this later, but for the moment, let us take the example of A. B. Marx, Burnham's central figure. II The range of Marx's activities as critic, theorist, teacher and composer was extraordinary. His main importance lay in his championship of Beethoven, as part of his general advocacy for characteristic music, and in synthesising Harmonielehre and Kontrapunkt within a single system in the monumental Die Lehre von der musikalischen Komposition (Marx 1887-90). In Burnham's reading, Marx developed his dynamic model of sonata form, his concern for structural wholeness and thematic economy, in order to accommodate and justify the special qualities of the heroic style. Whereas Burnham stresses continuities between Marx's programmatic and formal receptions of Beethoven, it would be fairer to view them as broadly parallel but independent enterprises which, indeed, often clashed. For example, when Judith Ballan tells us that Marx actually considered Wellington's Victory to be a masterpiece, our faith in Marx's analytical judgment takes a knock (see Ballan 1992, p. 153). A theorist is never stranger or more interesting than when he departs so radically from our horizon of expectations. Burnham's inveterate homologies are starved of such productive discordances. It could be argued against Burnham that the relationship between the inception of the sonata- form model and the identification of Beethoven's heroic plots was at best oblique, and at worst contradictory. Marx's archetypal sonata exposition is framed by a clear-cut opposition between Seitensatz and Gegensatz (1887-90, Vol. 3, p. 282). Yet none of Beethoven's symphonic expositions is more kaleidoscopic or thematically wasteful than the Eroica's. Marx's ternary conception of sonata form is in fact much closer to the Mendelssohnian scheme than to Beethoven's. The fit between form and programme is even more awkward: the recapitulation is obliged to return and repeat while the hero's journey moves forward towards its triumphant apotheosis. This is a perennial sticking-point in narratological interpretations of sonata form. The usual escape-hatch is to consider the recapitulation as a scene of remembrance of previous events, relegating the triumph to the coda; thus Schering concedes that 'the form of the sonata movement demands a repetition of the beginning, ... a return to an earlier stage of experience' (1933, p. 160). From this standpoint, he hears the reprise as either a 'memory' [Erinnerung] or a 'dream image [Traumbildes] of the wife staying at home'. Marx's monograph on Beethoven (1884) leaves out the recapitulation altogether, leaping to a new chapter entitled 'Die Sinfonia eroica Music Analysis, 1 6/iii (1997) t Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1997</page><page sequence="7">CRITICISM, ANALYSIS AND BEETHOVEN RECEPTION 375 und die Idealmusik' (pp. 271-88), then to 'Die Zukunftvor dem Richterstuhl der Vergangenheit' (pp. 288-96). He rejoins the discussion with, respectively, the preparation of the E minor theme in the development (p. 292) and the pedal-points in the coda (p. 294). Schenker's decision to cut short the graph of his own analysis of this movement (Schenker 1930) at the point of reprise must be considered a reflex within the same interpretative tradition. Nevertheless, his theoretical framework as a whole comprehends the tonal eff1cacy of formal repetition. This is not so in Marx's treatise, which cannot be seen as mitigating or redeeming his analysis in the same way. Like his Eroica essay, Marx's discussion of sonata form elides the recapitulation, sparing it less than four pages (1887-90, Vol. 3, pp. 297-300). 'The Third Section,' Marx writes, 'has the main task of repeating the First, although, of course, in such a way that the second group falls in the tonic' (p. 297). In fact, Marx's interest in formal coherence really extends only as far as the end of the exposition, with his talk of the Seitensatz completing the project of the Hauptsatz: 'in the first section [i.e., exposition], the second group must similarly achieve the completion [erganzen] of what the main group has begun' (p. 281). Against this sense of thematic closure, the second group's tonal openness was for Marx a minor issue. Marx's problems in co-ordinating structural and tonal schemes come out into the open when he tries to project his ternary sonata-form model onto the three-movement architecture of the entire piece: 'the middle movement is usually written in a slower tempo (such as Adagio, Andante, etc.), and affords a resting point, a moment of self-collection, becween the lively (e.g. Allegro, Presto) first and last movements' (p. 321). The motion-rest-motion scheme of the three movements runs counter, however, to Marx's paradigmatic formal scheme of rest-motion-rest: 'the opposition of rest, motion, rest is expressed through analogous moments of tonic, deviation [Ausweichung], tonic' (p. 322). Obviously, the slow movement is both restful and off-tonic. Charles Rosen has written that it was characteristic of Beethoven's eighteenth-century orientation to preserve the functional distinction between 'sections' and 'movements'. Marx's theoretical conflation of these categories only became possible when the subdominant (the typical restful key of the slow movement) lost 'its antithetical function of opposition to the dominant, becoming only another closely related key' (C. Rosen 1988, p. 354). This sort of section-movement conflation was common of music contemporary with Marx, such as Schumann's Fantasie in C, with its second group in F major. On the whole, Burnham's theory of influence is too 'linear', placing too much emphasis on Marx's debt to the precursor, Beethoven. He neglects the 'lateral' influence of Marx's contemporaries. Marx's most formative musical relationship was not with Beethoven or Schumann but with Mendelssohn, and the total absence of Mendelssohn's name from Beethoven Hero is astonishing. Marx became intimate with the Music Analysis, 1 6/iii ( 1 997) c Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1997</page><page sequence="8">376 MICHAEL SPITZER Mendelssohn family in 1825, and won over the young composer to his ideas about programme music, even taking an active role in the revisions to the Midsummer Night's Dream overture (see Ballan 1992, pp. 150-51). According to Marx's memoirs (Marx 1991, p. 213), the friends collaborated on the first drafts of the libretti of Mendelssohn's St. Paul and Marx's oratorio Mose. In fact, it was Mendelssohn's cool response to Mose which lead to their bitter falling out in 1839. Marx's subsequent writings are peppered with caustic attacks on the composer (see Marx 1855, pp. 51-2). Despite this personal rupture, it is undeniable that the two figures shared a patriotic committment to the spiritual and ethical regeneration of the German tradition, and, more particularly, that they identified these values with the revival of the German oratorio (see Stanley 1987, pp. 126-32). Marx's association with the Bach revival which Mendelssohn spearheaded casts his music theory in a different light. Though Burnham correctly represents Marx's sonata form at the top of his Formenlehre pyramid, with song and rondo forms at the bottom, he doesn't give the whole story. Marx deals with sonata form half-way through Vol. 3 of the four-volume treatise. But the real culmination of Marx's system is the last book of Vol. 4, on Ensemblesatz, or music for voices and orchestra. Here, the treatise's various strands - free and applied (angezoandte), formal and contrapuntal, instrumental and vocal - come together in the oratorio. Marx's professional enthusiasm for the St. Matthew Passion is evidenced by six articles he wrote for the BAMZ (Stanley 1987, p. 126). His more personal espousal of the Bach ethos can be gleaned from the opening page of Mose (Ex. 1), in which the chorus of the Israelites shares the same key, metre and mood of Bach's opening. Riemann recognised the Bachian strain in Marx's thought when, in the foreword to Vol. 2 (devoted to counterpoint) of the 1890 edition of Marx's Die Lehre, he wrote: 'Marx's warm enthusiasm for J. Bach is particularly manifest in the following second volume, expressed in the liveliest and most stimulating of terms' (Marx 1887-90, Vol. 2, 'Vorwort'). Marx's Beethoven monograph (1884) actually gives Bach equal status in the historical pantheon, and regularly brackets Beethoven and Bach jointly as 'republican' and contrapuntal thinkers: 'this truly republican independence of spirit [Freisinnigheit, liberalism] led both Beethoven and Bach to extraordinary daring [zu grossartiger Unbehummertheit] along a single harmonic path' (Marx 1884, p. 443). Burnham maintains that Wagner's portrayal of Beethoven's music as 'total melody ... provides the reception of the heroic style with its guiding metaphor: the concept of line' (Burnham 1995, pp. 31-2). But this is true in only a limited sense of Marx's writings. Marx does declare that 'the Life of Music inheres in melody', but the complete sentence is richer: 'the Life of Music inheres in melody, and also in several melodies which go with each other, and have to assert themselves against and beneath each other' Music Analysis, 1 6/iii (1997) c Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1997</page><page sequence="9">pp o o un poco ereseendo s6# v t -n-- t , S - &gt; A &gt; 1 S - &gt; i 3# # f v# v $ ; $ -;-*; ; $ z $ ; $ *_; ; $ 8 $ ; $ ;; 8 $ 2 CRITICISM, ANALYSIS AND BEETHOVEN RECEPTION A.

Marx hears the orchestra in the same way he hears Bach's chorus, as a community, or counterpoint, of individuals. And one could argue that Marx's 'guiding metaphor', in life as in art, is not 'heroic' but societal, even tribal. The role that Marx's Jewish extraction played in his negotiations with the Protestant theoretical establishment has never been clarified. Might Mose be interpreted as a plea for his beleaguered Jewish music theory, dressed in the rhetorical garb of its Lutheran model? Marx's struggles against the Prussian pedagogical tradition, epitomised by the official teaching of Siegfried Wilhelm Dehn's Theoretisch-praktische Harmonielehre (1840), are well-documented. On 28 June 1841, the year that he composed Mose, Marx wrote to Rochlitz in Berlin: Was there ever a fight more worthy for someone to wage than of achieving and maintaining justice, and the necessity of eventual progress for present and future, against a hundred-year-long stagnation and awkwardness, against lethargy, obstinacy and egoism? This puts me in mind of Goethe's 'He who would the devil fright, must bravely scream'. (Eicke 1966, p. 16) Marx's fight was with the Schulpharisaer, academic 'pharisees' like Dehn, whose theoretical treatise Marx had destroyed in his Die alte Musiklehre im Streit mit unsererZeit (Marx 1841). When Marx is attacking 'die alte Methode', with its 'habit of defining and describing, its confilsion of the objects of study' [Vermischung der Lehrgegenstande] (1841, p. 148), he is advocating a new philosophy of 'wholeness'. For Marx, as Burnham so well explains, 'the concept of wholeness guides his pedagogical enterprise at all stages: the student must be treated as a whole being; works must be treated as wholes; and the elements of musical language must not be artificially separated' (Burnham 1995, p. 70). The genius of art is the highest law, to which all artificial rules must yield. It is probable that Marx the theorist learnt his hermeneutics at Schleiermacher's aesthetics course in Berlin, which he took in 1819, 1825 and 1832-3 (see Eicke 1966, p. 34) . It is significant, nevertheless, that Marx the composer inscribed his faith into an oratorio about the danger of graven images (i.e., artificial pedagogical rules), rather than in a heroic symphony. Marx the Jewish intellectual chose to align himself with the Mendelssohn circle, and with the revival of the composer he called 'der besonnenste und kuhnste aller Tondichter' (Marx 1887-90, Vol. 1, p. 562), the most thoughtful and daring of all tone-poets: Bach. It is possible, therefore, to read Marx's life and work from 'background' to 'foreground', bringing out the half that was given over to Bach and counterpoint, toning down the Beethovenian voice-leading. Richard Kramer has reminded us that counterpoint is an ideology, or 'romance', associated with the values of 'immutable inner law' (R. Kramer 1987, p. 108). This lent itself to institutionalisation just as much as what would seem to be its opposite, MusicAnalysis, 16/iii (1997) &lt;) Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1997</page><page sequence="11">CRITICISM, ANALYSIS AND BEETHOVEN RECEPTION 379 the symphonic style which counterpoint disciplines. According to Sanna Pederson, 'Marx urged the German people to listen to the symphonies of Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven not only for the music itself but for themselves as a nation' (Pedersen 1994, p. 96). Pederson's stress on the socialising role of concert life is an important corrective to Burnham's individualistic perspective. At a deeper level, both Kramer's and Pederson's work suggests the possibility of a more dialogic model of analytical reception history, as an interplay between (background/contrapuntal) institutional values and (foreground/linear) personal concerns. There will be more to say about this composite 'Bach/Beethoven' model at the close of this article. III Beethoven Hero is weakest in the field of cultural theory. Chapter 3, 'Cultural Values', is an engaging, but depressingly monochrome, thumb-nail sketch of an enormously complex period. Burnham's claim that the heroic style 'sounds the deepest keynote' (1995, p. 118) of an age polarised between Hegelian closure ('Hegel's system is closed - the self generates and culminates its own destiny', p. 1 17) and Goethian openness (an 'endless process of becoming', p. 117) is circular and self-fulfilling. These two figures are so multi-faceted that the polarity might just as easily be reversed to reveal the tensions of Hegel's system and the Classicism of Goethe's thought. On the one side, Michael Rosen's critique of Hegel's dialectic has drawn attention to what he calls its 'post festum' paradox: so long as 'the true' is identified with 'the whole', then Hegel's system can only be understood or justified from its point of completion, a point, of course, that never arrives (M. Rosen 1982, p. 24). This paradox drew forth an entire tradition of negative dialectic, a movement which comes full circle with Subotnik's important Adornoesque critiques of Beethoven's heroic style which Burnham leaves entirely out of the picture. On the other side, Lawrence Kramer has recently presented a Goethe who was understood by contemporaries such as Novalis and August Schlegel as much for his practical nature as for his restless self-consciousness, a poet who 'continually rehabilitated finitude' (L. Kramer 1995, p. 125). Finally, it is not irrelevant that both Hegel and Goethe expressly disliked Beethoven's music. Kramer's 'Felix Culpa' chapter (pp. 122-42) makes a convincing case for Goethe's affinity with Mendelssohn, whom Goethe mentored. The problem with contextual studies is that they reduce unacceptably both text and context for the sake of falsely unified interpretation. Burnham's study is susceptible to the criticisms lodged by Dominick LaCapra against Janik and Toulmin's Wittgenstein 's Vienna (LaCapra 1990) which endeavours to assimilate Wittgenstein's Tractatus into the cultural climate of fin-de-siecle Vienna. This led the authors to stress the ethical dimensions of Wittgenstein's Music Analysis, 1 6/iii (1997) X3 Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1997</page><page sequence="12">380 MICHAEL SPITZER work at the expense of its logical side in an attempt to deny the standard interpretation of the Tractatus as a foundation of logical positivism. According to LaCapra, the authors' operating assumptions about the nature of interpretation blinded them to important aspects of the text, in particular the fact that the clarity of Wittgenstein's message (his 'picture-theory' of language) was at loggerheads with the paradoxical medium in which it was presented. It is only by drawing attention to the dissonances between the text and its cultural context, as well as within the text itself, that we can understand the future development of Wittgenstein's thought. 'One fruitful way of seeing the later Wittgenstein', says LaCaprs, 'is in terms of a more explicit exploration of the paradoxes of the Tractatus' (p. 113). Line by line, this argument is applicable to Beethoven. It is only by drawing attention to the dissonances between the Eroica's motivic fragmentation and harmonic expansiveness (its latent 'abstraction' and its monumental rhetoric) to the underdetermined forceful- ness of its cadential gestures, that we can understand the paradoxes of Beethoven's late period. Burnham's univocally mimetic interpretation ignores the crucial role that Beethoven's abstraction played in the history of composition, particularly for the Second Viennese School. At bottom, it seems, Burnham's problem is with the twentieth century. His quarrel with formalist analysis is really a comment on modernist varieties of aesthetic engagement. The issue here is one of canon formation, and the reaffirmation of a body of values perceived to be under threat. Burnham's book does for Beethoven what Harold Bloom recently did for Shakespeare: it puts a cultural hero at the centre of the 'Western Canon' (Bloom 1994). 'Shakespeare', says Bloom, is 'the largest writer we ever will know' (p. 3). Bloom's purpose is to defend the Shakespearian canon from what he dubs the 'School of Resentment' (p. 4), those postmodernist critics who would reduce the reading experience to a set of cultural tropes. Among this school must be counted musicology's Lawrence Kramer, whose Classical Music and Postmodern Knozuledge (1995) was published in the same year as Beethoven Hero, its ideelogical contrary. The two books are, in many ways, full-blown representations of positions staked out four years earlier in Burnham and Kramer's suggestive 'Counterpoint' debate in 1 9th-Century Music (Burnham and Kramer 1992). Broadly speaking, the debate split along lines of convergent vs. contestatory claims about the relation between music and meaning: Burnham discovered the two dimensions inhering in the plenitude of the concrete musical experience, while Kramer regarded meaning as emerging performatively and retrospectively through cultural work. In line with music theory's general nostalgia for a time when discourse about music was more public in nature, Burnham places his sympathies squarely in the golden age of German programmatic analysis. Kramer, equally worried by the passing of Classical music from 'the public sphere', nevertheless discovers new sources of Music Analysis, 1 6/iii (1997) t) Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1997</page><page sequence="13">CRITICISM, ANALYSIS AND BEETHOVEN RECEPTION 381 interpretative energy in postmodern orientations whose purpose is 'to recapture, not the content of an earlier discourse, but the role of that discourse in society and culture' (1995, p. 5). I will try to show that a dialogue is possible, even fruitful, between the two positions. This can be done by finding common ground between the two writers' conception of metaphoricity. For Burnham, metaphor entails a mode of analytical representation; Kramer conceives metaphor in a more dynamic, tropological, sense of discursive interaction. IV We take up Beethoven Hero from its opening chapter, with Burnham's synoptic programmatic/analytical reception of the Eroica. According to Burnham, a significant number of critics interpret the symphony's first movement as a scenario with an embattled and ultimately prevailing hero: 'Napoleon', a figure from Greek mythology, or Beethoven himself. Marx hears the the music of the first 45 bars as morning on the battlefield. The first subject is Napoleon himself, and the theme's climb from the depths of the orchestra to the first tUtti conflates the rising of the sun with Napoleon mounting his battle-steed. Moments of tonal vacillation, such as the C# at bar 7, represent passing clouds swept away by more decisive thematic statements. This dualism of'action and reaction' (Burnham 1995, p. 6) is interpreted by Alfred Heuss and Paul Bekker not in pictorial terms but as a conflict of psychological drives, or of private and public faces. Thus, the C# suggests 'demonic uncertainty' (p. 8), the cello line represents the hero's 'inner nature', and the rise to the tUtti lifts the hero up and out into the public exterior. Schering's version moves the action to the Iliad, and in a dramatic and psychological reading configures the dualism as a conflict between duty (Hector must fight to save his city) and inclination (Andromache beseeches him to remain with his family). In Burnham's view, all these critics are saying something important about the structure of the movement and about aspects of Beethoven's middle- period style in general. Hearing the first subject as unstable or vacillating, they have understood that Beethoven's opening section 'functions simultaneously as an introduction (setting) and as an exposition of the first theme' (p. 5). Furthermore, they have identified the vital traits of Beethoven's middle period, 'the alternation of active downbeat-oriented sections with reactive upbeat- oriented sections, the liberation of thematic development to the extent that it may even take place during the initial exposition of the theme, and the polysemic significance of the opening section, understood as combining the features of introduction, exposition, and development' (p. 7). The crucial point, however, is that the critics have chosen to articulate their formal insights in anthropomorphic terms, because 'metaphors involving human actions Music Analysis, 1 6/iii (1997) v Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1997</page><page sequence="14">382 MICHAEL SPITZER engage the imagination more directly' (p. 8). By contrast, the conception of this duality in terms of'downbeat orientation versus upbeat orientation' (p. 7), taken from David Epstein, is drier: although it is a 'metaphoric' translation of the same principle, it does not promote the same kind of identification with the music. Burnham's argument with technical analysis comes to a head in his discussion of Schenker's well-known graph of the development section. The response of most critics to the mysterious E minor theme (bar 284) is to emphasise its novel or disjunctive quality as an expressive turning point. Marx construes it as 'the utterance of an outside agency reflecting on the sad business of human carnage', and Peter Schleuning as an 'internally heard higher voice' warning Prometheus not to destroy his own work' (p. 9). In Schenker's graph, however, the theme becomes an elaboration of a chromatic upper neighbour note to B7, approached by an extended chain of rising fifth- progressions beginning in the fugato. Burnham concedes that Schenker's notion of Aufzoartsdrang ('urge to ascend', p. 11 ) bears the imprint of the heroic ethos, but Schenker's organicist zeal to assimilate and explain ends up neutralising the theme's most important feature - its expressive 'otherness' (p. 10). As Lawrence Kramer has noted, complaints that Schenkerian reduction neglects the expressive foreground are wide of the mark, since criticism and analysis do different jobs: 'Schenkerian analysis privileges the details that fit best into its schema of a highly ramified contrapuntal process; criticism privileges the details that carry the greatest expressive value, signifying power, and cultural resonance' (L. Kramer 1992, p. 78). The difference is not just irreducible, it can also be both expressive in itself and culturally significant. Kramer's emblematic example is the recapitulation from Haydn's 'Representation of Chaos', in which the completion of the Urlinie's descent (bar 40) coincides with 'the most violent moment in the piece' (1992, p. 6). According to Kramer, the contradiction here between background resolution and foreground disruption is not a methodological problem but a cultural trope of the period, i.e., the mastery of reason over nature and the objectivist will to control chaos. He finds similar reason/nature oppositions in images like William Blake's The Ancient of Days, where the creator's left hand extends into a pincer-like pair of compasses mapping and enclosing Chaos. Burnham's response is that Haydn's compositional scheme can hardly be identified with Schenker's analytical abstractions, as if the middleground provided 'access to the purely musical meaning of a work' (Burnham 1995, p. 75). Similarly, there is nothing 'abstract' about Schenker's concept of middleground, which is a thoroughly historical tangle of ideological principles. If criticism wishes to assimilate analysis into cultural practice, Burnham argues, then it must do so from within analysis and study the history of theory. So, the project of a Music Analysis, 1 6/iii (1997) &lt;) Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1997</page><page sequence="15">CRITICISM, ANALYSIS AND BEETHOVEN RECEPTION 383 hermeneutics/analysis crossover can be called off, since the two are already intertwined at a foundational level. Burnham's cultural web would seem to render Kramer's bridge-building obsolete. Kramer's comeback on this is conclusive. Just as Schenkerian analysis proceeds through a back-and-forth motion between interpretation and understanding, foreground judgements and background axioms, so the relationship between analysis and criticism is essentially circular. On Burnham's account, this circularity 'relaxes the claims of analysis to an indefensible epistemic authority. But it can do so in practice only if the product of analysis acknowledges rather than conceals the circularity of the analytical process' (Burnham and Kramer 1992, p. 78). In practice, Beethoven Hero conceals this circularity, freezes the debate, and so forecloses on the possibility of extending understanding. Nothing reveals Burnham's coyness in these matters more tellingly than his constant resort to the expression 'metaphor' as an all-purpose blanket-term. Thus 'programmatic criticism is metaphorically suggestive of underlying and archetypal processes' (Burnham 1995, p. 25), and again, the critics are 'responding metaphorically to something of great moment in the musical process, something that we would today be inclined to describe syntactically or stylistically' (p. 17). Metaphor, as Burnham surely knows, is a refined and powerful tool with an enormous literature behind it; the same can be said of Burnham's other favourite proxies, 'archetype' (does he means Northrop Frye's generic myths, Propp's plot structures, or just plain old Jungian symbols?) and 'prototype' (prototype-effect theory is actually a formal subdiscipline of cognitive semantics). These terms are used again and again to block the discussion rather than to open new doors. By 'metaphor', Burnham conflates two distinct axes of semantic opposition, and confuses two separate metaphoric functions, which could be called, respectively, the 'symbolic' and the 'schematic'. The metaphoric/literal opposition can be employed either to differentiate figurative from technical expression, or concrete from abstract experience. The two axes are not homologous. In one sense, Burnham's programmes are 'metaphoric' because they mediate the experience of listening through discursive tropes. In an opposite sense, however, they are 'literal', because they are grounded within this experience in a more concrete, embodied fashion. Conversely, the abstraction of technical analysis can be considered as a metaphoric projection from this experiential baseline. Burnham's use of 'metaphor' is actually closer to what Ricoeur terms the 'symbolic': 'metaphor occurs in the already purified universe of the logos, while the symbol hesitates on the dividing line between bios and logos. It testifies to the primordial rootedness of Discourse in Life' (Ricoeur 1976, p. 59). Symbols are more immutable than metaphors, since they 'plunge their roots in the durable constellations of life' (p. 64). According to Ricoeur's helpful distinction, the MusicAnalysis, 16/iii (1997) &lt;) Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1997</page><page sequence="16">384 MICHAEL SPITZER heroic plot owes its persistence to its groundedness in basic levels of human experience; it is therefore symbolic rather than metaphoric. But programmes create meaning, rather than simply discover them. In this respect, they are 'schematic'. Let us pursue Marx's Eroica programme past the point at which Burnham's book breaks off, the entry of the second group (bar 45). Marx hears the passage as the 'distant call of jubilant field-music [jauchzende Feldmusik]; broken into disconnected fragments, passed from instrument to instrument, gleaming in the light of the morning sun' (Marx 1884, p. 258). The critic thereby directs the listener's attention not to the thematic character of the passage, but to the orchestral dialogue with its play of instrumentation and motivic fragments. Now compare Marx's programme with Schering's interpretation of the same section: 'Andromache [im Seitenthema 45-551 beseeches him again, this time adding a note of flattery to her plea' (Schering 1933, p. 166) . Schering hears the insistent flattery [Schmeichelnden zugesellend5J in the thematic line's affecting appoggiaturas. Unlike Marx, therefore, Schering focuses the listener's attention on the music's melodic character. Indeed, he is using the standard trope of 'second subject as feminine'. We know from his treatise that this trope was available to Marx; he describes the possible relationship between first and second subjects as 'das Weibliche gleichsam zu jenem vorangehenden Mannlichen' (Marx 1887-90, Vol. 3, p. 282). But he elected not to employ it for the Eroica, because he heard the passage differently. It is possible to argue, in fact, that Marx's schema is more intricate and useful than Schering's. Marx observes that 'from a distance and from within, the theme sounds like a whole [von Weitem, und innerlich Eins]', but from without it sounds 'broken into disconnected fragments [ausserlich gleichsam zusammenhanglos in abgebrochenen Gliedern]' (1884, p. 258). Marx's soundscape schema, with its suggestive analogy between ambient vanishing-points and structural hearing, is a marvellous example of just how much a phenomenology of music might yet achieve. But Burnham's synoptic overview of the Eroica interpretations locates their analytical or cognitive import not in themselves, but in their rather uninteresting common denominator; their 'archetypal' level. To conclude that 'all these critics feel the effect of duality and describe it in terms of action and reaction' (Burnham 1995, p. 7) does a considerable disservice to the true subtlety of these interpretations. Furthermore, it indicates just how self- defeating Burnham's flight from theory turns out to be. V The moral of this story is simple, and hardly original. Musical 'reality' is both constructed and given, and listening involves an irreducible element of 'listening for'. It is the job of critics and theorists alike to direct this 'listening MusicAnalysis, 16/iii (1997) g Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1997</page><page sequence="17">CRITICISM, ANALYSIS AND BEETHOVEN RECEPTION 385 for' procedure. What Burnham caricatures as 'the textbook categories of musical experience' (Burnham and Kramer 1992, p. 75) shouldbe regarded as resources rather than obstacles to hearing. The recognition that musical experience is non-identical with categorical perception is coherent with the quite separate claim that musical experience is predicated on these categories. As Michael Arib and Mary Hesse put it, although we have no 'perennial truth value, we do generally have an observation language rich enough to express observations not assimilable to current theory. Moreover, we also have the ability to recognise experiences that are not well described in the observation language' (Arib and Hesse 1987, p. 8). Operative in Burnham's book is the assumption that Marx's observation language (i.e., its use of 'metaphors involving human actions', Burnham 1995, p. 8) constitutes what reception history calls a kairos, or point de la perfiection (see Dahlhaus 1985, p. 157). The alleged sympathy between Marx and Beethoven is reinforced, of course, by their very contemporaneousness. Yet an axiom of Jauss's thinking is that coeval reception is often the most blinkered, and that qualities of the aesthetic work emerge only much later in history. Nowadays, when to understand historical 'others' is always to forgive, it is difficult to convict pre-Schenkerian theorists on anything but foundationalist grounds. But, by the same token, the loose, baggy monsters of nineteenth-century music criticism should be acquitted for the right reasons. The virtue of Marx's Lehre is that it is roomy and messy enough to accommodate a huge range of musical observations unassimilable to any theory, past or present. It scores few points, however, for explanatory power. If music theory can be said to progress, then it does so by blending methodological parsimony, richness and heuristic efficacy in frameworks of increasing coherence. Another way of saying this is that analysis becomes less like a Swiss army knife and more like a single, all-purpose, tool. In this regard, it is wrong to present a Marxian analysis as being as typical of his ethos or system as a whole to the same extent that a Schenkerian graph is typical of the later theorist's work. From this standpoint, the old and modern extremes of Burnham's synoptic Eroica overview are strictly non-commensurable: Schenker's analysis is in every sense more complete than its precursors. Crucially, whereas Schenker's 'formalist' analysis stands on its own two feet, the 'metaphorical' analysis Burnham opposes to it is a composite of fragments judiciously cherry-picked from analyses which would not be half as convincing by themselves. If analysis is to continue as a viable profession, then raking over what Dahlhaus calls the 'debris' of music history is not necessarily the only move left on the board. The initial phase of any discipline, including music analysis, typically involves its delimitation as an autonomous field of study. Once this is over, the same moves which took writers on music through their formalist and cognitive turns will see the discipline into its second stage, which may be expected to recuperate the programmatic dimension. Burnham's vision Music Analysis, 1 6/iii (1997) g Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1997</page><page sequence="18">386 MICHAEL SPITZER of this second stage is that of a re-turn, or a turning away. But it is likely that the new analysis, when it finally arrives, will be more 'formalist' or 'cognitive' than ever before. Burnham's pessimism, therefore, is convincing only if one accepts the terms of his argument. His argument is itself based on an idiosyncratic, if not arbitrary, selection (and omission) of sources. Beethoven Hero's lapsarian narrative of music theory's fate is unfolded in chapter 3 across four mini- chapters, devoted to four canonical theorists: Marx, Riemann, Schenker and Reti. His partisanship with Reti's psychological programmes is the least persuasive: Reti is neglected not just for ideological reasons, but because he is generally felt to be a bad analyst, and no amount of special pleading will change that. The chapter as a whole pivots on a comparison between Marx's and Riemann's analyses of Beethoven's Op. 31 No. 1, a particularly quirky work. Marx comprehends the opening movement's surface disiunctions in terms of a 'form-generating opposition between a Gang-engendering motive and a Satz-engendering motive, between the will to motion and the will to closure' (Burnham 1995, p. 73). The background affect of the work - its 'spirited, yet flighty character' (p. 73) - supposedly motivated Beethoven's compositional decisions, such as his exotic choice of secondary key (B major). For Marx as for Beethoven, the 'whole' is in view at all times. By contrast, Riemann transferred the idea of wholeness to theoretical constructions - eight- bar periods and harmonic prototypes - from which the music was heard to deviate. Though Riemann's analytical tools were a lot sharper, the true dynamic impulse of the music slipped through his net. 'We are now,' says Burnham, 'in a position to see how Riemann's work makes possible an important turn in the history of Beethoven analysis, and thus of music analysis in general. For Riemann's functional prototypes are measured in terms of an overall underlying form. The prototypical dimension remains, but it has shifted from the global and spiritual to the local and perceptual' (p. 87). Burnham's thesis is misleading on both counts. Riemann was perfectly capable of expressing himself in figurative terms when he wanted to: his analysis of the 'Moonlight' Sonata speaks of its 'passionately agitated, storm- tossed' character (1919, Vol. 1, p. 251). Moreover, his refined rhythmic vocabularly was instrumental in addressing the work's restless qualities. Homing in on the finale's first bar, he declares that 'the hardest problem ... lies in determining the role of the semiquaver rest at the start of the bar' (Riemann 1919, p. 253). He then relates Beethoven's opening to an analogous example from Bach's three-part invention in ES. Compared with Marx, Riemann has a much more extensive grasp of historical connections. His analysis of Op. 31 No. 1 settles the question of its substitute dominant, B major, from the very outset by adopting a stylistic approach in which the work is put in the context of Beethoven's other experiments in third-related key areas, such as the MusicAnalysis, 16/iii (1997) C) Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1997</page><page sequence="19">CRITICISM, ANALYSIS AND BEETHOVEN RECEPTION 387 Variations Op. 34 (governed, Riemann observes, by a falling chain of thirds, F-D-B&gt;G-EWC-F), and the Waldstein Sonata. Riemann's interest in the 'character' of music may well be less paramount than Marx's. But this is more than compensated by his greater sensitivity to normative context, to the extent that the listener's appreciation of comic works, such as Op. 31 No. 1, depends on a knowledge of historical conventions. James Webster has written that this work's odd turn to B major is only comprehensible against the background of early sonatas such as Op. 10 Nos. 1-3, with their modulating transitions: 'Beethoven's transitions often feint in the direction of a different key before quickly reverting to the true second group key' (Webster 1978, p. 22). Op. 31 No. 1 is, accordingly, 'spirited, yet flighty' (Burnham 1995, p. 73) because it calls the (enculturated) listener's bluff, sticking within a 'wrong' key rather than reverting to the dominant. Marx, at least as Burnham represents him, comes across as a theorist entirely preoccupied by the internal dynamics of the music, with little sense of the composer's dialogue with convention. This is ironic, in view of both Marx's reputation as a taxonomist and Burnham's (Charles) Rosenesque leanings. The Tovey-Kerman-Rosen critical heritage of which Burnham seems to partake has traditionally championed the claims of temporality and 'dramatic fitness' against the spatialising tendencies of graphic analysis. But, by the same token, these critics are nothing if not keenly sensitive historians of style. Burnham's indifference to the normative side of historical transmission weakens his reading of Schenker's intellectual development. In Burnham's view, Schenker's monograph on the Fifth Symphony, which appeared as a series in Der Tonwille, marks 'an important station in the transformation of Schenker's conception of musical motives, Stufen, and the fundamental line' (Burnham 1995, p. 90). More radically, Burnham argues that the 'Fate' motive itself engendered the first movement's Urlinie, as well as the concept of Urlinie that Schenker then generalised for all music. By identifying the Fundamental Line with the inexorable thrust of this music, Schenker seals 'the circular relationship that obtains between Beethoven and the theorists' (p. 101). Beguiling as this notion might be, it is just not factually true. The first instalment of the Fifth Symphony analysis (Tonwille, Vol. 1, 1921) is presented contiguously with an analysis of Bach's E; minor Prelude from Book I of the Well-Tempered Clavier (Schenker 1921,pp. 38-45). Moreover, Bach's appearances in the Tonwille outnumber Beethoven's by eight to seven, even when we include the three instalments of the Fifth Symphony analysis.3 If, as Burnham sees it, Beethoven gave Schenker his 'guiding metaphor' of line, then Schenker draws from Bach his conception of diminution and phantasy. Schenker writes of the Prelude's 'flowering-forth [Fortpflanzungstrieb] of myriad repetitions' (1921, p. 38), and he shows much more concern for MusicAnalysis, 16/iii (1997) C) Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1997</page><page sequence="20">388 MICHAEL SPITZER recurrences or variations of motivic progressions than for the Urlinie's teleological aspects. This prototypical element in Schenker's theory, its grounding in contrapuntal and harmonic models, is now rather fashionable. William Renwick writes persuasively of Schenker's debt to the Baroque tradition of 'stereotyped patterns of structure', practical building-blocks for improvisation and composition. For example, the middleground octave descents which Schenker detects in the preludes in C major and minor, D major and E minor from the Well-Tempered Clavier, Book I, are all influenced by the regola del l'ottova, the Baroque practice of 'basing chordal realizations on harmonization of a scale' (Renwick 1995, p. 12). One might just as well speak of a 'Bach model' for reception history as a 'Beethoven model', or better still, a syncretic 'Bach- Beethoven' model. The 'Vermischtes Anhang' of the 1923 edition of Tonwille contains a little-remarked essay by Schenker entitled 'Bach-Beethoven' (Schenker 1923, pp. 43-5). Schenker muses on Beethoven's letter of 1819 to Archduke Rudolph, in which the composer asserts that he, together with Bach and Handel, belong to an 'Aristokratismus in der Kunst' (p. 44). Schenker then spins an elaborate metaphor, weaving together ideas of leading subjects in fugues (Beethoven's annotations of the C minor fugue from Book II), commanding figures in musical history (Bach the teacher of Beethoven), and spiritual leadership (Bach the 'missionary'). Finally, bringing the social, theological and artistic strands together, Schenker identifies the prospects of the Bach-Gesellschaft with the good works of the englischen Bibel-Gesellschaft. 'Art', says Schenker, 'makes brothers of all men' (p. 43). VI Choosing one's icons can be an arbitrary business. Bruno Nettl, taking an even grander purview than Burnham, believes that 'the mythology of the Music Building' is a set of variations with two intertwined paradigms, the 'myth of Mozart' interactingwith the 'myth of Beethoven' (Nettl 1989, p. 7). Whether our model is Bach-Beethoven, Mozart-Beethoven, or simply Beethoven alone, we must conclude that Beethoven Hero is mostly Burnham's hero. The book is never less than provocative and should be examined by anybody with an interest in any of the fields Burnham tries to unite. But it must be said that Burnham's rather brow-beating rhetoric is often as underdetermined as the heroic style for which it proselytises. Beethoven Hero is a hugely assured performance and an enjoyable read. But the urgency of its message is really a propos of nothing.
