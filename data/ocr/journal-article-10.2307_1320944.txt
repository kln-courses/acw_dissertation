Twenty-seven art education majors learned the clustering strategy for writing metaphoric interpretations of three kinds of paintings (realistic, abstract, and nonobjective) seen as color slides. Subjects were randomly divided into two groups. Prior to interpreting the paintings the experimental group engaged in relaxed attention exercises; the control group heard a lecture about the importance of those exercises. Eight judges rated students' written interpretations of the paintings on a 0-5 scale from literal to metaphoric. Interjudge reliability was high. The clustering strategy increased the metaphoric nature of students' written interpretations for all three kinds of paintings. Relaxed attention exercises significantly increased metaphoric interpretations of realistic paintings only. eaching art appreciation yields the skills to specify visual qualities, to identify styles, to recall dates and facts about the artist and the times, to state preferences supported by reasons, and to distinguish between such things as form and pattern. Those skills, though essential to intelligent viewing, are insufficient to appreciate art. Lacking is the skill to interpret works of art metaphorically. To interpret anything metaphorically is to make meaning. Meaning can be of two general kinds: literal and metaphoric. Literal meaning communicates, denotes. It stands in one-to-one correspondence with its referent and has consensual agreement within a culture. In contrast, metaphoric meaning evokes, con- notes. Metaphoric meaning stands in one-to- many correspondence with its referent and does not necessarily have consensual agree- ment within a culture. It subsumes literal meaning and moves into the realm of personal experience. Yet metaphoric meaning, while not exactly the same for everyone, does fall within the broad range of common experience.' Metaphor is considered by many to be an essential process and product of thought (Black, 1962; Feinstein, 1980, 1982; Honeck &amp; Hoffman, 1980; Johnson, 1981; Langer 1953, 1957, 1976; Ortony, 1975, 1979; Rico, 1976, 1983; Sacks, 1979). The metaphoric thought process promotes the understanding of one thing, concept, or experience in terms of another. In that process, attributes of one thing are transferred to another. In the trans- fer, clusters of attributes that belong to one thing interact with those of another. The interacting attributes are like filters that highlight certain associations, suppress some, and redefine others (Johnson, 1981). After the transfer of attributes takes place, ideas, situations, and feelings are reorganized and vivified, paradoxically both condensed and expanded. The result is that associations are generated. Different or deeper levels of meaning are tapped, and new insights emerge. When the metaphoric process results in a developed work of art, that product is itself a metaphor (Langer, 1957). If we agree with Langer that art is metaphor, then it follows that students need to be taught how to decipher the metaphor, that is, how to engage in the metaphoric process. The purpose of this study was to teach students a way to interpret paintings metaphorically and to test the effectiveness of that method.2 Two assumptions were explored: that meta- phoric thinking, being holistic, can be fostered by a strategy that de-emphasizes literal-analyt- ical thinking; and that feelings, associated more with metaphoric thinking than with literal-analytical thinking, can be evoked more readily when one is relaxed rather than tense. A fuller account of the concept of meaning and metaphor can be found in Feinstein, 1982. An abridged version of this study was presented at the National Symposium for Research in Art, University of Illinois, September 24, 1982.</page><page sequence="2">THE METAPHORIC INTERPRETATION Clustering is a search strategy that enables students to construct metaphoric meaning in written forms (Rico, 1976, 1983) and in visual forms (Feinstein, 1980). The strategy is one of rapid searching, which inherently precludes analytical thinking. Literal description, analysis, evaluation, and preference are held in abeyance. When using the clustering strategy to respond to a painting, it is scanned quickly for a dominant impression; this is written as a word or phrase and circled. Radiating outward from the circled word(s) are clusters of other words, reflecting the painting's qualities and the feelings evoked in the viewer. From the original dominant impression and the clusters of descriptors a metaphoric phrase or statement is written, which captures the interpretation of the painting. Metaphoric interpretation via the clustering strategy is not an end in itself, but may be considered a component of Feldman's (1972) guide for teaching art criticism. Relaxed attention exercises (McKim, 1972; Feinstein, 1980) are designed to release excess mental and physical tension and to promote heightened awareness and concentration. Seven such exercises were used in this study. Six focused on the head, shoulders, eyes, arms, and hands; one focused on breathing concentration. Two hypotheses were tested: that subjects taught the clustering strategy to interpret paintings will produce more metaphoric (less literal) responses than control subjects; and that relaxed attention exercises before cluster- ing will produce more metaphoric responses than will lectures about relaxed attention. All subjects were taught the same clustering strategy, designed to encourage the metaphoric interpretation of paintings. The strategy was subsequently augmented in one situation by relaxed attention exercises, and in another situation by a lecture. Method Subjects Subjects were 27 junior-year art education majors, ranging in age from 21-38. The scores of five subjects were excluded from the analyses due to incomplete data, leaving a total of 22. Stimuli Color slides of paintings were arranged into three groups: realistic, abstract, and nonob- jective (Feinstein, 1980). The three kinds of paintings were characterized by their relative adherence to or departure from realistic depiction and their relative reduction into fundamental shapes and forms. Thus a kind of painting is different from a style of painting (Fauvism, Surrealism, or Minimalism), which may also refer to historical periods and ideol- ogies. Realistic paintings embody images that are commonly understood and consensually nameable, as in works by Harnett, Cassatt, Hooper, and Warhol. Abstract paintings also embody images that are commonly under- stood and consensually nameable, but the images are distorted in terms of form and color or are displaced, often with a change of scale. The essence of the realistic image is retained in many abstract paintings, as in works by Picasso, Margritte, Matisse, deKooning, and Duchamp. Nonobjective paintings have minimal refer- ents to the consensually nameable. These referents are the circle, triangle, square, and their derivative shapes as might be seen under a microscope and in works by Vasarely, Pollock, and Frankenthaler. The three kinds of paintings do not have rigid boundaries, and should be thought of as existing on a con- tinuum with some overlap. Prior to the study the slides had been verified as to kind and similarity within kind by five members of university faculties of art education and art history. Design and Procedures The study was conducted between February 1 and February 15, 1982, in an art education course entitled Response to Visual Forms. There were two treatment conditions or phases. In Phase One the clustering strategy was learned and used by all subjects. In Phase Two, while the clustering strategy again was used by all subjects, half of them engaged in relaxed attention exercises; the other half received a lecture about the importance of those exercises. Phase One of the study consisted of four meetings of approximately one hour and 15 minutes each. During the first meeting, meta- phoric interpretation was explained and all subjects were given a pretest to determine the extent to which they could interpret slides of paintings metaphorically. During the second and third meetings they were taught the clustering strategy and given homework 78</page><page sequence="3">HERMINE FEINSTEIN assignments. During the fourth meeting they were given a posttest. The pretest and posttest tasks were to write metaphoric interpretations of paintings (slides). During the posttest, subjects used the cluster- ing strategy they had learned to interpret the paintings. For the pre- and posttests 24 slides were shown, one group of 12 for the pretest and another group of 12 for the posttest. Each group of 12 slides was divided into three kinds: four realistic, four abstract, and four nonobjective, presented in that order. The posttest slides were similar, but not identical, to the pretest slides. Each slide was shown for four minutes. Phase Two of the study consisted of one meeting of approximately two hours, during which the 22 subjects were randomly assigned to two groups (experimental and control) of 11 subjects each. Both groups used the cluster- ing strategy to interpret a third set of 12 slides, again divided into three kinds and shown in the sequence described above. Before inter- preting the paintings, the experimental group engaged in 15 minutes of relaxed attention exercises. The control group heard a 15 minute lecture about the importance of relaxed attention exercises. Treatment of the Data The results of Phase One were analyzed with a 2 x 3 factorial analysis of variance using repeated measures on both factors, times (two levels: pre- and posttests) and kinds of paint- ings (three levels: realistic, abstract, and nonobjective). The results of Phase Two were analyzed with a 2 x 3 factorial analysis of variance using repeated measures on one factor, kinds of paintings, with three levels (realistic, abstract, and nonobjective). Response Ratings All responses from both phases of the study were rated according to a six-point scale that ranged from literal to metaphoric, 0-5 respec- tively. A total of 792 responses were assessed by eight judges: five university faculty members and three graduate students. The faculty were from departments of psychology, educational psychology, and philosophy; the graduate students were from special education and art education. Seven of the eight judges were selected from a weekly reading group studying research on metaphor and related topics. The eighth judge, an art education graduate student, had a special interest in metaphor. Approximately three hours were devoted to training the judges. The training materials used were responses of five subjects whose incomplete data made them ineligible for the study. The judging sessions proper occurred on two con- secutive occasions. The judges rated the responses independ- ently, referring to the rating scale while looking at the slides that elicited the responses. They were told to bear in mind one overriding question: What else can this painting repre- sent? For example, if one response to Hopper's House by the Railroad was an elaborated literal description of the house, a low rating of 1 or 2 was given on the scale ranging from 0-5. If another response to the same painting did not refer to the house, but referred to metaphors such as loneliness, alienation, old- age, or abandonment, a high rating of 4 or 5 was given. Of 27 correlation coefficients, 19 or 70% are .60 or greater, the smallest being .13 and the highest .86. Although there were eight judges and 792 responses, four judges rated the responses of each subject. Each judge rated approximately 396 responses, one judge rating as few as 352 and another as many as 429. Results Phase One Times. The results of Phase One indicate that use of the clustering strategy increases metaphoric responses. The posttest mean ratings for all kinds of paintings are signifi- cantly higher than those of the pretest, F (1,21) = 8.98, p &lt; .05, shown in Table 1. The mean rating overall for the posttest is 3.12, and for the pretest 2.71 (see Figure 1). Table 1.

The differences among kinds of paintings are significant, F (2,42) = 4.72, p &lt; .05, indicated in Table 1. There is no significant interaction effect. Realistic paintings have the lowest mean ratings, ab- stract paintings rank somewhat higher, and nonobjective paintings highest. The mean ratings for the three kinds of paintings in- crease roughly in the same magnitude on both testing occasions (see Figure 1). Phase Two Conditions. The results of Phase Two indicate that relaxed attention exercises added to the clustering strategy do not significantly increase metaphoric responses uniformly across the three types of paintings. The difference between the mean ratings of the experimental and control groups does not quite reach statistical significance. The probability was set at &lt; .05 and the level attained is &lt; .0527 (see Table 2). The mean rating for the experimental group across all kinds of paintings is 3.29, for the control group 2.72. Those results are displayed in Figure 2. Kinds of Paintings. There is a significant difference among ratings for different kinds of paintings, F (2,40) = 16.54, p &lt; .0001, shown in Table 2.

Discussion Subjects and the Experimenter's Role The fact that females outnumbered males in both phases of the study could have influ- enced the results. Females may respond differently from males to the clustering strategy and to the relaxed attention exercises. Those factors, as well as the age differential, though deemed outside the scope of this study, need to be investigated in the future. The experimental teaching was conducted by the author, which is another variable that could influence the results. Training another instructor was not an option. Rather than postponing the study for an indefinite time, the experimenter-teacher role prevailed. Mean Ratings by Kinds of Paintings and Order Interjudge Reliability Metaphor research, being a relatively new field of study, does not have a large variety of standardized measuring instruments, nor many that consistently yield high positive interjudge correlations (Pollio &amp; Smith, 1980). The high correlations obtained from the newly devised rating instrument, though encourag- ing, may be due to its simplicity. The judges were required to rate written interpretations of paintings only on the extent to which they were literal or metaphoric. The scale was not designed to determine the quality of metaphoric responses: whether they were more novel or common; more analogic or metaphoric; more anthropomorphic, feel- ing-morphic, or object-morphic. Neither was the scale designed to determine the referential adequacy of responses by requiring the judges to locate the visual qualities in the work that may have prompted the interpretation (Pepper, 1945). The nature and function of the scale used in this study may be a possible reason for its success. (3.56) (3.52) Realistic (1st) Abstract (2nd) - I I 81</page><page sequence="6">THE METAPHORIC INTERPRETATION Phase One The clustering strategy increased metaphoric interpretations in about equal proportion for the three kinds of paintings even though the extent of metaphoric usage differed according to kind of paintings viewed. It is not surprising that use of the clustering strategy increased metaphoric interpretations. In general, when students are taught, they will learn. The clustering strategy engages the student with the work of art on a personal level. Whereas factual knowledge about the work is not a sine qua non, ability to respond in the here and now is. In addition to encouraging personal engage- ment with the work, the clustering strategy apparently promoted some concept generali- zation. The posttest paintings were similar to but not the same as the pretest paintings. There were two teaching sessions and two homework assignments between the pre- and posttest. In those four practice sessions students interpreted paintings similar to but not the same as those in the pretest. In other words, the concepts taught were applied to different paintings within and among the three kinds. Restraint must be used in generalizing the results of this study due to the lack of a formal control group. Subjects functioned as their own informal control group in the sense that they had not been exposed to the clustering strategy in previous classes. When asked to interpret paintings metaphorically in the pretest, subjects' scores were lower than they were on the posttest. The issue of nonrandomization of slides arises in the finding of response differences among kinds of paintings, the mean ratings being lowest for realistic paintings, somewhat higher for abstract paintings, and highest for nonobjective paintings. In all testing situa- tions the slides were presented in distinct sets: four realistic slides were shown first, four abstract slides second, and four nonobjective slides third. Given the time constraints, it was thought that a clearer result for each kind of painting would emerge if subjects were not required to switch categories rapidly. One might accept that explanation but still question the sequence of slide sets, maintain- ing that the high ratings for nonobjective paintings were due to their third place in the sequence. Subjects may have had a chance to practice on the first two kinds of paintings. The issue of practice notwithstanding, nonob- jective paintings seem to lend themselves to metaphoric interpretations more readily than do realistic and abstract paintings. Therefore, nonobjective paintings probably would have generated the most metaphoric responses regardless of their place in the sequence. The absence of a significant interaction in Phase One between pre- and posttests by kinds of paintings indicated that the kinds of paintings generating fewer metaphors at pretest also generated less at posttest. Realistic paintings elicited the fewest metaphors both times, abstract paintings more, and nonobjec- tive paintings even more. This finding may be affected by one of the variables mentioned above: nonrandomization, the effects of practice, or the ease of interpreting nonobjec- tive paintings metaphorically. These possible confounding variables would need to be controlled in future studies. Phase Two Relaxed attention exercises added to the clustering strategy did not increase metaphoric interpretations equally across the three kinds of paintings. It is surprising that they did not. Generally, when one is more relaxed than tense, there is a freer flow of associations. This finding may be due to the small sample. In general, effects with small samples that achieve statistical significance can be inter- preted as reflecting larger effects because the magnitude of the standard error is inversely related to the size of the sample. Since the probability level of the test for differences among kinds of paintings was strong, p &lt; .0001, the issue of a small sample may be irrelevant. To further explain the strong differences in metaphoric interpretation elicited by different kinds of paintings in Phase Two, it is neces- sary to consider possible causes of the interaction effect. The control group's mean rating for realistic paintings was considerably lower than the mean of the experimental group. This difference may have been due to the lecture condition as well as to the effect of relaxed attention exercises. The discursive nature of the lecture paralleled the literal nature of the realistic paintings, which may have impeded metaphoric responses. Because realistic paintings, by definition, embody consensually agreed upon and readily nameable phenomena, they are likely to elicit literal interpretations. One is inclined to name what one sees. Naming is primarily an analytic process that tends to obstruct metaphoric 82</page><page sequence="7">HERMINE FEINSTEIN interpretations, primarily a holistic and immediate process. In other words, two processing modes compete for primacy, and the one operating at the moment usually wins. The notion of an impeding effect of the lecture on the control group's mean rating for realistic paintings is given added credence by the group's subsequent increase in metaphoric interpretations of abstract and nonobjective paintings. Consistent with the foregoing explanation regarding the interaction effect is the experi- mental group's higher mean rating for realistic paintings. Although the finding concerns a nonconfirmed hypothesis, a speculation is offered. It may be that relaxed attention exercises do make a difference in the meta- phoric interpretation of realistic paintings. The tendency to interpret literally those images inbued with literal cues is restrained when one is somewhat relaxed. The exercises apparently did not influence the interpretation of abstract or nonobjective paintings. Summary and Conclusions The premise of this study is Langer's con- tention that art is metaphor. The purpose of the study was to teach students a way to interpret paintings metaphorically and to test the effectiveness of that method singly and in combination with other variables. Two assumptions were explored: first, that meta- phoric thinking can be fostered by a strategy that de-emphasizes literal thinking; second, that feelings are associated more with meta- phoric thinking than with literal thinking, can be evoked more readily when one is relaxed rather than tense, and thereby facilitate metaphoric responses. Because the study is the first of its kind and may have limitations, certain findings may not be generalizable and perhaps should remain within their contextual confines. The study's educational significance is a different issue, however. If one believes in the value of meta- phoric thinking and agrees with Langer that art is metaphor, teaching students to think metaphorically could have an educational return that far exceeds the investment. Once having learned to interpret works of art metaphorically on a personal level, meaning is expanded and enriched. With additional training, it is not only possible to become more sensitive to society's visual metaphors, but also to begin to question the values embedded in them. References Black, M.
