<plain_text><page sequence="1">PICO AND NEOPLATONIST IDEALISM: PHILOSOPHY AS ESCAPE Harry Berger, Jr. In a series of three essays published in the centennial review I have attempted to define a hypothesis based on the concept of period imagination, a hypothesis which might serve as an approach to the more detailed and concrete in terpretation of specific works.1 The second and third essays centered on a leading characteristic of the Renaissance imagination, the interest in the second world or heterocosm, the ways in which this interest was closely related to recon sideration of the concepts of play and fiction, to developments in perspective and to humanist attitudes toward art. The aim of the present essay is to suggest what in retrospect appears to be a defective embodiment of the Renaissance imagination, defective primarily because of its failure to take those interests sufficiently into account. My discussion will focus on Pico della Mirándola but will extend to other figures in an effort to characterize the limits of the particular kind of Neoplatonism associated with the Florentine Aca demy. In the first section I shall describe some of the es sential features of Pico's thought and world view, in the second I shall briefly criticize them, and in the third I shall hazard some general critical conclusions. I In the second proem to his Heptaplus, Pico divides the universe into three worlds, supramundane, celestial, and terrestrial, bound to each other by the various modalities of logical connection. Man, the fourth world, contains within himself all the aspects of the first three as possibilities, i "The Ecology of the Mind," VIII (Fall 1964), 409-435; "The Renaissance Imagination," IX (Winter 1965), 36-78; "L.

Within man all things lose their fixed outlines and are open to whatever new destiny man in his metamorphic freedom may achieve for them. But this is achieved here in the soul, not there in the world, and the validity of the achievement depends for Pico on an explicit boundary-marking gesture, "Here, not there." For man is somehow in two places at once: here he is a frail dweller in the terrestrial world of mortal bodies (caduca corporum substantia) sharing with animals a single situation—"unprotected by cover or shade, exposed to rain, snow, sun, heat and cold," and whether pure or impure, sacred or profane, subject to "the perpetual alternation of life and death."2 There, the all-things-in-all-things of the occult and Neoplatonic literatures are tempered by the fixed hierarchic topography of the essentially Aristotelian world model on which Pico superimposes them. The two worlds are further distinguished, though not con sciously, by a difference of inflection based on what Kant later analyzed as the difference between the external and internal forms of intuition: the there is conceived by Pico in primarily spatial terms, the here in temporal terms. There is a where, but here is a now. Man must see himself not only in both places but also in two relations: as a fixed object occupying a predetermined place in that medieval cosmos where time is a defective image of eternity, and where the eternal is felt primarily in visual or spatial terms; but also as an experiencing subject who occupies a span of time and within whom space and time emerge as modes whereby con sciousness conceives its objects. If the language I am using sounds too modern, the distinction can be put this way: a determinate and hierarchic cosmos is one which has been spatially actualized and localized; an indeterminate creature whose central faculties are ratio and voluntas is a power 2 Heptaplus, Pr. 2, in De Hominis Dignitate, Heptaplus, De Ente et Uno e Scritti Vari, ed. by Eugenio Garin, Florence: 1942, I, 186.

Though Pico describes man as a fourth world in the Heptaplus, in the Oratio he treats him as a second creation, a new being and a new mode of existence placed over against the first and distinguished by his consciousness (ratio) of his situation. In positing a disjunctive relation between world and man, Pico in effect lays stress on the second world taken by the mind. When God finished the first work of Creation, he "kept wishing that there were someone to ponder the plan of so great a work, to love its beauty, and to wonder at its vastness." Therefore, having made the finite universe per fect in plenitude, order and diversity, he created man "as a creature of indeterminate nature" and placed him at the world's center so that "thou mayest from thence more easily observe whatever is in the world" and so that "with free dom of choice and with honor, as though the maker and molder of thyself, thou mayest fashion thyself in whatever shape thou shalt prefer."3 The initial assignment of limits is crucial to Pico's position, and consistent in his thought. One finds in Ficino many praises of homo faher and these are intended, as André Chastel in Marsile Ficin et l'art (1954) has observed, "to fix by the analogy of art the manner in which God is present in his creation," and to suggest the comparable dignity of man, deus in natura: "his creative activity has its metaphysical justification in the fact that it extends the divine act which makes a perfect masterpiece of the universe." But Pico stresses homo speculator rather than homo faber. Man is praised for making himself rather than 3 "Oration on the Dignity of Man," tr. by E. L. Forbes in The Renaissance Philosophy of Man, ed. by E. Cassirer, P. O. Kristeller, J. H. Randall, Jr., Chicago, 1948, pp. 224-225.

Man is like an artist and beholder standing before a perspective picture. The human eye, situated at a proper distance from the object—the universe—sees the whole from a particular sub jective viewpoint which is at once ideal and true, a view point which man can vary according to his choice. Placed at a distance which will best allow him to see, man's field of activity lies within himself. But this new privilege has as its counterpoise a new distance from God. In his Commento on Benivieni's poem, Pico takes issue with Ficino's concept of the beautiful (II, 3, 8) mainly because he wishes to separate God more cleanly from the realm of Ideas than Ficino does. At the same time, he makes this realm a more self-sufficient goal, for in knowing Ideas man somehow truly knows God and possesses the good, and yet, as Cassirer has shown in an essay on Pico (JHI, III, 1942), that is only the truth, knowl edge and possession of symbolic form. Cassirer goes on to draw the consequences: Pico is no longer trying to exhibit the Many as the effect of the One, or to deduce them as such from their cause, with the aid of rational concepts. He sees the Many rather as expres sions, as images, as symbols of the One. And what he is trying to show is that only in this mediate and symbolic way can the absolutely One and the absolutely unconditioned Being man ifest itself to human knowledge. . . . There are only different symbols and different interpretations of one and the same meaning, which is the foundation of them all, but which is not capable of being grasped by us as it is in itself, without any symbolic intermediary. ... he maintains that our think ing and conceiving, in so far as it is directed toward the Divine, can never be an adequate expression, but only an image and a metaphor. And yet in the merely metaphoric, the merely imaginative, lies man's preeminent power of transforming reality as he can. Taking his stand within the relatively limited domain of poetic theology, implicitly revising the very significance 41</page><page sequence="5">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW of the term ontological, Pico is able to make and to some extent validate greater claims on man's behalf. The new position assigned to man is discussed by Pico as that of a magus and interpres. Distinguishing the good from the bad form of magic, he remarks that the former "is nothing else than the utter perfection of natural philos ophy," and he derives the word, on Porphyry's authority, from the Persian magus, which "expresses the same idea as 'interpreter' and 'worshiper of the divine' with us." The magus "is the servant of nature and not a contriver," one who does not so much work wonders as diligently serve a wonder working nature . . . having clearly perceived the reciprocal affinity of natures, and applying to each single thing the suit able and peculiar inducements . . . [he] brings forth into the open the miracles concealed in the recesses of the world, in the depths of nature, and in the storehouses and mysteries of God, just as if she herself were their maker . . . and [he] weds lower things to the endowments and powers of higher things. (Forbes, pp. 247-249.) Sorcery or witchcraft is a presumptuous assertion of power which betrays itself as weakness: the attempt to be a con triver or wonder-worker "makes man the bound slave of wicked powers" and subjects him to the "enemies of God." Its motivation seems connected with the uncontrolled de sire of the lower faculties, the urge of the pleasure principle to do away with all difficulty and obstacles to ease. The sorcerer is a false god trying to create a false nature, bypassing the discursive questing of natural philosophy in order to attain the false image of that peace which can only be granted by theology: if you see one blinded by the vain illusions of imagery, as it were of Calypso, and softened by their gnawing allurement, delivered over to his senses, it is a beast and not a man you see. the irascible power which struggles ... as the champion of desire . . . seizes in the dust and sun what desire will devour slumbering in the shade. 42</page><page sequence="6">PICO AND NEOPLATONIST IDEALISM Natural philosophy will allay the strife and differences of opinion which vex, distract, and wound the spirit from all sides. But she will so assuage them as to compel us to re member that, according to Heraclitus, nature was begotten from war, that it was on this account repeatedly called "strife" by Homer, and that it is not, therefore, in the power of natural philosophy to give us in nature a true quiet and unshaken peace but that it is the function and privilege of her mistress, that is, of holiest theology. (Forbes, pp. 226, 229 231-) If we consider Pico's attitude toward astrology, we may infer that interpretation or natural magic is the normative mean between two forms of surrender: astrological determinism which would do away with the responsibility of the thinking creature now (here), and Utopian magic which would wish away the natural limits of the human animal there in the terrestrial world. This process of interpretation may be concretely illus trated on a small scale by a passage from the Oration in which Pico considers how man may return to the divine source; the passage begins with an exhortation: Let us disdain earthly things, despise heavenly things, and finally, esteeming less whatever is of the world, hasten to that court which is beyond the world and nearest to the God head. There, as the sacred mysteries relate, Seraphim, Cheru bim, and Thrones hold the first places; let us, incapable of yielding to them, and intolerant of a lower place, emulate their dignity and their glory. If we have willed it, we shall be second to them in nothing. But how shall we go about it, and what in the end shall we do? Let us consider what they do, what sort of life they lead. If we also come to lead that life (for we have the power), we shall then equal their good fortune. (Forbes, p. 227.) The key word here is emulate—aemulemur. Emulation is aggressive imitation, an agon between the emulating self and its exemplar. The method of emulation about which Pico asks is most fully demonstrated at the level of style, by the grammatical and rhetorical strategies of his answer. The angels are first treated as exemplars at a distance from the self, 43</page><page sequence="7">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW superior and independently real—"There, as the sacred mysteries relate, they are. Let us observe them, imitate them, make ourselves their equals": The Seraph burns with the fire of love. The Cherub glows with the splendor of intelligence. The Throne stands by the steadfastness of judgment. Their reality is grammatically affirmed in the true Aristo telian manner: the angelic substance is the subject, the pred icate includes its energeia in the mode of essential attribute. By imitating the activity, man may come to share in the attribute: if, in giving ourselves over to the active life, we have after due consideration undertaken the care of the lower beings, we shall be strengthened with the firm stability of Thrones. If, unoccupied by deeds, we pass our time in the leisure of contemplation, considering the Creator in the creature and the creature in the Creator, we shall be all ablaze with Che rubic light. If we long with love for the Creator himself alone, we shall speedily flame up with His consuming fire into a Seraphic likeness. The situation calls for metaphor only in its Aristotelian sense of the transfer of quality. But in the next two sentences the relation between angel and man becomes more fluid, more symmetrical: Above the Throne, that is, above the just judge, God sits as Judge of the ages. Above the Cherub, that is, above him who contemplates, God flies, and cherishes him, as it were, in watching over him. Here the attribute is focused as a genus of which angels and men may be species—the class of just judges, or of con templative creatures—while the angelic title seems to be transferred from its proper reference to this genus. In effect Pico has replaced the substance with the power as the sub ject of thought. This leads to the following statement, the syntax of which may allow us to see the Seraph reduced to a vehicle or symbol of man as lover: 44</page><page sequence="8">PICO AND NEOPLATONIST IDEALISM Whoso is a Seraph, that is, a lover, is in God and God in him, nay, rather, God and himself are one. Great is the power of Thrones, which we attain in using judgment, and most high the exaltation of Seraphs, which we attain in loving. Thus Pico has converted the Seraph from reality to meta phor, from angelic substance to human operation, from re mote exemplar to indwelling attribute. In the next passsage, the Cherub as contemplation seems at first to have the status of a mere emblem: Moses loved a God whom he saw and, as judge, administered among the people what he had first beheld in contemplation upon the mountain. Therefore, the Cherub as intermediary by his own light makes us ready for the Seraphic fire and equally lights the way to the judgment of the Thrones. This is the bond of the first minds, the Palladian order, the chief of contemplative philosophy. Pico will later convert Moses in the same way, but here the historical figure provides an exemplar: man as complex embodiment of the simple qualities abstractly signified by "angels." Yet from this point on, Pico stylistically suggests a return of the Cherub to his original reality. At first this is merely implicit in the Cherub's reoccupation of the gram matical subject; he is still treated as an artificial model: This is the one for us first to emulate, to court, and to under stand; the one from whence we may be rapt to the heights of love and descend ... to the functions of active life. But truly it is worth while, if our life is to be modeled on the ex ample of the Cherubic life, to have before our eyes and clearly understand both its nature and its quality and those things which are the deeds and the labor of Cherubs. But Pico then asserts man's insufficiency and interposes the mystical tradition between himself and the angels: But since it is not permitted us to attain this through our own efforts, we who are but flesh and know of the things on earth, let us go to the ancient fathers. . . . Let us consult the Apostle Paul, the chosen vessel, as to what he saw the hosts of Cheru bim doing when he was himself exalted to the third heaven. He will answer, according to the interpretation of Dionysius, 45</page><page sequence="9">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW that he saw them being purified, then being illuminated, and at last being made perfect. Let us also, therefore, by emulating the Cherubic way of life on earth ... cleanse our soul We can know about real Cherubs only through the rare testi monies of God's chosen vessels; it is the human testimony, the symbolic form rather than the reality itself, which provides the model. In the process of emulation embodied in this passage, boundaries are marked, dissolved, reasserted between the mind and the reality which is its model and object. The ascensus of the mind is thus unequivocally internal, poetic, metaphoric—the movement "upward" is diagrammatically conceived as a movement inward. The Piconian metamor phoses through which "man becomes all things" and so creates his own nature are processes of imagination. They are neither magical nor merely fictional. Not magical, because the word "becomes" really means, for Pico, "plays the roles of." Not fictional, because the transformational activity of mind which his language mirrors is part of the growth of a real self and adumbrates a reality an sich: the very passage, as an aemulatio, is a historic moment in the development of Pico della Mirándola. The process whereby angels are con verted to abstractions or hypothetical figures thus has onto logical significance. But the reference of ontological is in transit here, for the domain of objective spirit is less con gruent with cosmos and more with homo than it is even in Ficino. Where Ficino usually speaks of anima, Pico usually addresses or speaks of homo. This is significant, since there is a World Soul but not a World Man. The individual soul may easily be envisaged as in or part of the universe, a portion of the World Soul, its epistemological counter part, etc. But man is a self-contained unit whose body and soul may be set over against the world as well as en visaged within it. Spiritual tends in its connotations to move toward psychological, mental, imaginative; therefore the play of metaphor becomes a more substantial activity so long as it is circumscribed as such: 46</page><page sequence="10">PICO AND NEOPLATONIST IDEALISM in the medium of this symbolic form of knowledge the fixed dogmatic content of the Church's teaching begins in some measure to grow fluid. Whatever is substantial and sacra mental is dissolved and becomes intimation, an image of some thing purely spiritual. Neither word nor picture, neither rite nor any other external action can exhaust the deepest mean ing of the religious.... (Cassirer, "Pico," p. 139.) But an image becomes an image-of, a noumenon, only through that final self-limitation whereby the mind bounds the area in which it has given play to its constitutive power and distinguishes that area from the transcendent realm where cherubs are ineffable. Pico's seems a casual or con ventional rather than a felt gesture of limitation. The domi nant vector of his thought is the movement from world to self, from reality/history/nature to mind, from mystery to metaphor. This becomes clearer if his treatment of the angels is compared to others. St. Augustine, for example, is quite definite on the subject of angelic emulation: Those who seek God by way of the spiritual powers set over the world or its parts, drift far away from him—separated not by space but by difference of affection. They strive towards the eternal, and desert what lies within them, though God is more inward than the innermost. They may have heard or conceived of some holy celestial power; but what draws them is the admiration that human weakness feels for the works of such a power, rather than the model of reverent submission which attains to the rest of God. They choose rather the pride of angelic potency than the devotion of angelic being. No holy person rejoices in his own power, but in the power of him from whom is derived all potency for fitting action. the saying "Know thyself" has a different sense from a saying like "Know the Cherubim and Seraphim": our knowledge of them is belief concerning beings not present to us, based on the statement that they are a kind of heavenly power.4 Much later, after God was understood to have revealed knowledge through the agency of pseudo-Dionysius, one could say more precise things about angels—so long as it was * De Trinitate VIII.ii (vii), X.12 (ix), tr. by John Burnaby, Augustine: Later Works (Library of Christian Classics, VIII), London, 1955, pp. 51, 85. 47</page><page sequence="11">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW revealed knowledge about heavenly powers whose reality extra nos was unquestioned: "God loves in the Seraphim as charity, knows in the Cherubim as truth, resides in the Thrones as equity. . . By the time of St. Bonaventure, who cites this passage from St. Bernard in the Itinerarium Mentis in Deum (IV. 4), there was an Empyrean at the circumfer ence of the actual world in which to situate the angels, and the common opinion was that if ever men could truly be like angels it would only be in the next life. Before the literal ascent of the blessed soul through the spheres, likeness was restricted to proportional analogy, as when, for example, the soul is ordered in a way which corresponds to the nine angelic orders. In all this, the functions of self, mind and metaphor were exercised in place—place being defined by two coordinates, the earthly center of the cosmos and the human middle of the hierarchy of creatures. The point of invoking angelic exemplars lay in the fact that their greater perfection and higher reality were presupposed. When St. Bonaventure has symbolic recourse to the Seraph, it is the six-winged figure seen by St. Francis in the vision of Alverna, and when he writes, "si . . . Cherub es essentiala Dei contemplando" (Itin. VI. 5), he is not thinking of a real angel but of the symbolic figures on the tabernacle (Itin. V. 1): to the placing of man in the spatial and vertical hierarchies of cosmology and mystical theology, these usages add a historical-figural ambience which firmly, if implicitly, controls and defines the experience being described. The two viae to God rational and mystical, or philosophical and theological— could still be related to each other as complements or alternatives, and the particular kind of tension between them discloses what was not yet problematical: the other ness and distance between God and man; consequent ac ceptance of the information conveyed by different external intermediaries (Scripture, Church, tradition, perception); the ability to let the qualities of the information (facts, dog mas, symbols, images) rub off on the mystical objects to 48</page><page sequence="12">PICO AND NEOPLATONIST IDEALISM which they were extended without jeopardizing the "inef fable" and transcendent otherness of such objects. Thus, on the one hand, St. Bonaventure can elaborate correspondences with abandon in order to bring near what is presupposed as remote and dissimilar; on the other hand, he can resolve the tension between inward and outward itineraries by ap plying the principle of hierarchic subordination which pre supposes the unity of the one true world. By Calvin's time, those things which St. Bonaventure could presuppose had become problematical: the relations between consciousness and Being, hierarchy and unity, interpretation and reality. Calvin's so-called iconoclasm is an attempt to evolve a less isomorphic style of reference, one which by revealing its difference from its transcendent referents in creases their distance. It is in the course of articulating this program that he mentions the Cherubim of the tabernacle, using them in a way which clearly reveals his departures from both St. Bonaventure and Pico: God sometimes appeared in the form of a man, but this was in anticipation of the future revelation of Christ, and, there fore, did not give the Jews the least pretext for setting up a symbol of Deity under the human form. The mercy-seat, also . . . where, under the Law, God exhibited the presence of his power, was so framed, as to intimate that God is best seen when the mind rises in admiration above itself; the Cherubim with outstretched wings shaded, and the veil covered it, while the remoteness of the place was itself a sufficient concealment. It is therefore mere infatuation to attempt to defend images of God and the saints by the example of the Cherubim. For what, pray, did these figures mean, if not that images are unfit to represent the mysteries of God, since they were so formed as to cover the mercy-seat with their wings, thereby conceal ing the view of God, not only from the eye, but from every human sense, and curbing presumption.® To this we may compare Pico's treatment of the tabernacle, as well as his use of the historical figure Moses: o Institutes of the Christian Religion, I.xi.3, tr. by H. Beveridge, London, »953. I. 92-93 49</page><page sequence="13">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW Let us also cite Moses himself . . . proclaiming laws to us who are dwellers in the desert loneliness of this body: "Let those who, as yet unclean, still need moral philosophy, live with the people outside the tabernacle under the sky, meanwhile purifying themselves like the priests of Thessaly. Let those who have already ordered their conduct be received into the sanctuary but not quite yet touch the holy vessels; let them first like zealous Levites in the service of dialectic minister to the holy things of philosophy. Then when they have been ad mitted even to these, let them now behold the many-colored robe of the higher palace of the Lord, that is to say, the stars; let them now behold the heavenly candlestick divided into seven lights; let them now behold the fur tent, that is the ele ments, in the priesthood of philosophy, so that when they are in the end, through the favor of theological sublimity, granted entrance into the inner part of the temple, they may rejoice in the glory of the Godhead with no veil before his image." This of a surety Moses commands us.... (Forbes, pp. 232-233.) It is worth noting that the difference here is not located in Pico's confident allegorizing as opposed to Calvin's meek submission to the text. Calvin allegorizes as much and as confidently as Pico. But the style of allegorization differs: Pico gives play to metaphoric fancies because his main in terest is in the possibilities of the symbolic form; Calvin asserts its limitations by stressing its inadequacy. As we saw above (p. 45), Pico had previously introduced Moses in a more historical perspective, but here he uses him as a mouthpiece. This is not Moses, but Pico playing the role of Moses. Where Calvin enforces the historical autonomy of scriptural events and figures as a guarantee of true interpre tation, Pico revises Moses according to the rationale of aemulatio, which involves transforming literal fact to meta phor, theological "poetry" to poetic theology, a then to a now, a historical to a mental occasion. And this raises some important questions about the relation between his aims and his accomplishment. For if his definition and program of interpretation are novel, they are too seldom embodied in his practice in such a way as to be adequately represented, much less enacted. 50</page><page sequence="14">PICO AND NEOPLATONIST IDEALISM II In moving from description to critique, we have to keep in mind the difference between Pico's stated intentions and those "motives" which a later interpreter elicits from his work. The present essay is concerned primarily with the life, thought, personality, motives and in general the "activity of spirit" which the work itself renders. With Pico, as with Ficino, Bruno and many others loosely called Renaissance Neoplatonists, we are confronted with a body of work which is, from a literary or philosophical point of view, second-rate, while being of great significance to the history of culture and ideas. Nesca Robb, whose judgments are always shrewd and perceptive, has summed it up this way in Neoplatonism of the Italian Renaissance (1935): There are writers who live though their works die, and Pico is one of them. ... it is Pico himself rather than his work that is still vital. He was the raw material of a poet, lacking in lit erary gift yet possessed of an inherent poetry of mind and character that illumines his life and breaks in veiled flashes through the inchoate clouds of his learning. In exploring a gap of this sort between the man behind the work and the man in the work, our attention may most profitably be directed toward the formal, structural and stylistic exigencies which are entailed but not realized by Pico's "philosophy." The assumptions and motives of Pico the man are familiar and may be briefly set forth: he believes that God's language is the language of symbol—"hieroglyph"—and that divine symbols display their transcendent origin by being hermeti cally obscure; they hide their meanings and thus spur the mind of man to interpretation. The cosmos is the greatest symbol, and the Mosaic scripture—especially Genesis—is its pre-eminent verbal representation. Moses is a model for all writers because he was inspired to set down in a single synoptic text a vision of the cosmos which infolded all pos sible interpretations. Pico treats the inspired account of Crea tion as the product of intuitive or noetic thought—having 51</page><page sequence="15">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW received the Word from the same Spirit who presided over Creation, Moses is called aemulator naturae. Less fortunate interpreters who are not thus inspired must fall back upon discursive modes of apprehension normal to fallen man. Pico resorts to ratio, to philosophy and discursive interpre tation, in order to get beyond them and attain to a simulta neous intuitive vision of God. Though his often labored pur suit of correspondences appears nothing if not rational, the context of pursuit is an emotive and mystical quest. His interpretive exercises may seem little more than a game, yet they have a serious psychological function: through them he hopes to work himself up to a state in which the vision will (seem to) flood his mind with its light. He is of course aware that man is not and cannot become God, that human dignity entails the tragic limitation, that if man could liter ally become a god he would lose the essential mark of his greatness, that is, the impulse to transcend a condition of mortality which in one sense cannot ever be transcended. The distinction between discursive and noetic knowledge, between the human and angelic forms of apprehension, is of course very old, but Pico's concern with it derives im mediately from Ficino. In Theologica Platónica III. i Ficino cites the field seen and painted by Apelles: It is the field which gives Apelles' soul at one and the same moment the perception of the view and the desire to paint it, but if Apelles sees and paints one blade of grass, then another, in successive moments, this is no longer an effect of the field but of Apelles' soul, which by nature is capable of seeing and performing things not simultaneously but suc cessively. As André Chastel remarks, the example is intended to dis tinguish "the normal modes of our inner activity from the operations aroused by the intervention of God and the angelic world, where intuitions are given as simultaneous wholes; and it is precisely toward the splendors of the superior vision and its symbols that Ficino's curiosity tends." Ficino's 52</page><page sequence="16">PICO AND NEOPLATONIST IDEALISM conception derives from Plotinus' famous misinterpretation of the hieroglyph: The sages of Egypt ... in order to reveal to us their wisdom . . . symbolized objects by hieroglyphs, and in their mysteries symbolically designated each of them by a particular emblem. Thus each hieroglyphic sign constitutes a kind of science or wisdom; and without discursive conception or analysis places the thing under the eyes in a synthetic manner.6 But Ficino passed on to Pico an interest not so much in the mystical character of the symbol as in the discursive con tent and the process leading up to the intuition embodied in the image: "Unless one knows what a hieroglyph means, one cannot see what it says. But once one has acquired the relevant knowledge, 'unfolded' by more or less exoteric in struction, one can take pleasure in finding it 'infolded' in an esoteric image or sign."7 To see the whole universe as a radiant hieroglyph, or rather to strip away the veil and see it all at once in angelic vision, was the goal of Ficino's philo sophic quest. His spiritualization of the humanist praise of man was ambiguous to the extent that this goal made him sensible of the life in time as fragmentary and unsatisfactory, an exile from man's true home. Time, itself like a hiero glyph, existed to be transcended. The particular symbol Ficino uses in his gloss on Plotinus is curiously emblematic of his central concern: Your thought of time ... is manifold and mobile, maintain ing that time is speedy and by a sort of revolution joins the beginning to the end. It teaches prudence, produces much, and destroys it again. The Egyptians comprehend this whole discourse in one stable image, painting a winged serpent, holding its tail in its mouth.8 The emblem visualizes the prior acts of thought whereby the mind came to the intuition the image represents. It is &amp;Ennead V.viii.6, Works, tr. by K. S. Guthrie, Alpine, N.

The interest in the discursive process thus leads the mind, whether consciously or not, to symbolize its own interpreta tion rather than the object giving rise to the interpretive impulse. This tendency is more assertive in Pico. He strives to establish in the object of his attention some otherness which is to be overcome—or more precisely, to establish it in order to overcome it. This otherness may be something exemplary, or neutral, or recalcitrant, or partial, or defective, but what ever it is, its function is to stimulate him to confront it, trans form it, assimilate it—in short, to dissolve the world into the self as a first phase in the process of self-transcendence, a first step on the ladder to God. When we turn our attention from the man and his motives to the work and its character, we may locate one important cause of failure in this tend ency, for it produces an unbalanced interest in the subject, the self, and tends to dissipate the very sense of otherness which makes self-transcendence possible. In his polemic against astrology, for example, he distinguishes natural (physical and spiritual or intelligible) causes from occult causes in the cosmos: the former influence nature but not man, the latter are not astral or demonic forces but human fictions, symbols, projections. But Pico's aim, as Cassirer has shown, is the liberation of man, not the objective revalua tion of nature. Unlike the cosmologists and scientific philos ophers of the later Renaissance, his attempt to improve human power does not proceed by freeing nature from hu man idols, striving to make it more independent and real so that it may be confronted as it is in itself. His attempt proceeds rather by freeing man from nature and restricting all nonhuman influences. The result, as Cassirer says in Individual and Cosmos, simply extends the thesis introduced in the Oration: . . not a new way of conceiving nature, but a new way of conceiving man's worth. Now, against the power of 'Fortuna' is opposed the power of 'Virtus'; against destiny, the will conscious of itself and trusting in itself." 54</page><page sequence="18">PICO AND NEOPLATONIST IDEALISM Cassirer remarks that Pico sees in man's sinfulness "noth ing but the correlate and counterpart to something other and higher": Man must be capable of sin, that he may be capable of good. For this is just Pico's underlying idea, that in good as in evil man is never a completed being, that he neither rests ever securely in good, nor is ever a hopeless prey to sin. The way to both lies ever open before him—and the decision is placed within his own power. . . . Hence however high he may rise, man must always expect a Fall: but at the same time no Fall, however deep, excludes the possibility of his rising and standing erect once more. ("Pico," pp. 229-230.) Pico's main interest is in the rising vector: sin and evil are less real to him than human power; they are dialectically necessary rather than existentially present in his writing. That is, they function as alien obstacles to be overcome so that man may fulfill the main tendency of his nature, which is to keep moving. Thus, if natural philosophy reminds us that it is not in her power, "to give us in nature a true quiet and unshaken peace," this is not because of human limits but simply because of the limits of natural philosophy, which passes the baton to "holiest theology." Even when God is the object of inquiry, the same tend ency to establish then dissipate the otherness of the object makes itself felt. In the longest and most important chapter of the De ente et uno (Chapter V), Pico leans heavily on Pseudo-Dionysius' negative theology to characterize God as "the being who infinitely transcends all that can be imag ined."9 The purpose of the chapter is "to show that not only with the Platonists and Peripatetics, who disagree with one another, but often in the same single writer, there can be, with respect to the divine attributes, many affirmations and many negations equally just" (p. 20). The argument ex emplifies Pico's attitude as described by Cassirer (p. 41 above): "our thinking and conceiving, insofar as it is direc » Pico della Mirándola: Of Being and Unity, tr. by Victor Hamm, Milwau kee, J943, p. 26. Future page references are to this translation. 55</page><page sequence="19">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW ted toward the Divine, can never be an adequate expression, but only an image and a metaphor." Pico arranges the quest for knowledge of God in four degrees, in the third of which God is conceived as superior to whatever is signified by the transcendental terms (the one, the true, the good and being). "In the fourth degree, finally, we know Him as superior not only to these four transcendentals, but also to every idea which we could form, to every essence which we could con ceive Him to be" (p. 26). After two short chapters disposing of Platonist difficulties in regard to prime matter and multi plicity, Pico devotes the eighth chapter to showing how "being, unity, truth, and goodness, are present in all that exists beneath God" (p. 28). This leads to a curious reversal in Chapter IX, "In which it is indicated how these four attributes pertain to God," for they can be referred to Him not only-—as we might expect—"as He is the cause of other beings," but also "as He is taken absolutely in Himself" (p. 32). The tone of the discourse at this point makes it difficult for us to believe that Pico has taken seriously his own strictures on the limits of attribution, for he seems to have shifted in an unqualified manner from negative to positive theology: We conceive God, then, first of all as the perfect totality of act, the plenitude of being itself. It follows from this concept that He is one, that a term opposite to Him cannot be imag ined. See then how much they err who fashion many first principles, many gods! At once it is clear that God is truth itself. For, what can He have which appears to be and is not, He who is being itself? It follows with certainty that He is truth itself, (p. 32) We cannot tell whether Pico has lowered God or whether he has simply given up God-as-He-is and retracted his dis cussion to the symbolic form of God, God-as-He-is-conceived. In the tenth and final chapter, at any rate, he draws a moral from the treatise by using the transcendentals as the ground of an aemulatio Dei, for example: Let us, lest we speak more of other things than of ourselves, 56</page><page sequence="20">PICO AND NEOPLATONIST IDEALISM take care that, while we scrutinize the heights, we do not live too basely, in a manner unworthy of beings to whom has been given the divine power of inquiring into things divine. The best precept . . . which this discussion can give us, seems to be that, if we wish to be happy, we ought to imitate the most happy and blessed of all beings, God, by establishing in ourselves unity, truth, and goodness. Let us therefore fly from the world, which is confirmed in evil; let us soar to the Father in whom are the peace that uni fies, the true light, and the greatest happiness. But what will give us wings to soar? The love of the things that are above. If ... by grace of truth, we do not fall beneath our model, we have only to move towards Him who is our model, through goodness, in order to be united with Him in the afterworld. Since, finally, these three attributes: unity, truth, and good ness, are united to being by a bond which is eternal, it follows that, if we do not possess them, we no longer exist, even though we may seem to do so; and although others may be lieve we exist, we are in fact in a state of continuous death rather than of life. (pp. 33-34) It is not God's love for us but our love of higher things, not the grace of God but the grace of truth, which will urge us upwards. The treatise in this fashion ultimately reduces God to a terminus for man, and even the remoteness of the God of mystical theology may serve chiefly to indicate how high man can soar by the proper use of his own powers. There is little feeling in Pico of human action as a response to divine pressure, as part of a dialogue with a God who is both pres ent in the soul and wholly other. The God who cannot be determined as an object exists indeed as a noumenon for Pico, but as such He is of little functional or methodological importance. It may of course be argued that the De ente et uno is not meant as mystical theology, but this is the point: Pico uses the strategy of the via negativa merely to respond "to the arguments which the Platonists invoke to sustain against Aristotle . . . the superiority of the one over being" (p. 20). 57</page><page sequence="21">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW The chapter is an episode in his unfinished attempt to reconcile Aristotle and Plato, and at its conclusion the brief essay into theology is abruptly terminated: From all this we conclude that God is . . . the being who infinitely transcends all that can be imagined, as David the prophet put it in the Hebrew: "Silence alone is Thy praise." So much for the solution of the . . . difficulty. The window is now wide open for a true understanding of the books com posed by Denys the Areopagite on Mystical Theology and The Divine Names. Here we must avoid two mistakes: either to make too little of works whose value is great, or, seeing that we understand them so ill, to fashion for ourselves idle fancies and inextricable commentaries, (pp. 26-27) Since Pico does not avail himself of the newly opened win dow, his Q.E.D. would be a non sequitur except for the fact that it underlines his main theme, which has less to do with God and Denys than with trying to solve old problems in new ways. Here, as in the envoi of the final chapter with its somewhat inconsistent and irrelevant though characteris tically Piconian attention to the rising vector, we cannot be sure whether Pico is more serious about the body of the argument or about the reflective envelope in which he has placed it. It is something of a jolt to see the transcendental terms used in the tenth chapter in a purely figurative manner, after they had been treated with scholastic seriousness in previous sections. The tenth chapter has ostensibly the struc tural function of a return—from God to man, from con templation to action, from intellectual withdrawal to moral application. But in fact it seems to display itself chiefly as a rhetorical triumph: the topics previously referred to God have now been neatly transferred to man; the subject of the De ente et uno has been verbally assimilated to the familiar assertions about the dignity of man. There is a "return" in name only, since the areas of mystical, meta physical and ethical discourse are but nominally distinct. And the "return" is itself an exhortation to renewed with 58</page><page sequence="22">PICO AND NEOPLATONIST IDEALISM drawal: "Let us fly from the world and soar to the Father, imitating Him by becoming unified, true, and good; since these three attributes are united to being, we do not exist if we do not possess them, and are in a state of continuous death." The notions of nonexistence and death aroused here are no less imprecise, no less hyperbolic, than the image of soaring, which means—reduced to literal terms—retiring within oneself and meditating on the Neoplatonic ascent. Ill From this examination of Pico it seems legitimate to draw some general critical conclusions which I think apply as well to Ficino, to Bruno and to other thinkers influenced by Florentine Neoplatonism. In brief, it might be said of them that they go up without coming down, they withdraw without returning, their going-up is a form of withdrawal, and not withdrawal with but withdrawal from their problems. Some of the causes, qualifications and ramifications of the dilemma follow: 1) In the case of the three above figures, especially Bruno and to a lesser extent Ficino, withdrawal or escape is pro jected into the work, while their lives in different ways ex emplify courage, will and endurance. Nesca Robb's judg ment that the man is better than the work applies to Ficino and Bruno as well as to Pico. Speaking of Ficino's protracted period of melancholia she remarks that "little is known of this episode," and certainly very little of it is felt in his formal work as a scholar and "philosopher." The opera seem to represent not the pressure but the purging of the problem. If he "carried on his work unflinchingly through a lifetime of ill health," this is precisely what the work leaves behind in its often enthusiastic optimism. Ficino gave his depression a traditional intellectual focus by viewing it as a conflict between his faith and his philosophy, and it was es sentially this conflict which produced a body of work most notable for the quality of reconciliation. Relatively late in his life he became a priest, and this may suggest that the opera 59</page><page sequence="23">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW provided him with the locus amoenus in which problems were worked out and resolved, if not transcended. While Ficino remained very much in the world as a priest, Pico, who had fewer personal problems, was fascinated in a more or less esthetic way by the idea of fleeing the world. However seriously he intended it, the interest in asceticism which became marked in his last years seems in retrospect to have been pursued as a game. Though he came under Savonarola's influence during this period he was unable to make a real renunciation—he could only speak and write of it, and perhaps this was a way of putting off the real thing. At any rate, his renunciation was put off until after death—he was buried in the habit of a Dominican monk. The act of writing and philosophizing may thus function as an expression of the pleasure principle, and the work may become a green world. The will to do away with an imperfect actuality leads the serious Neoplatonist to con vert his wish to a hope, to confuse the ideal with the idyllic and project them not only "upward" but also "outward" as presumptive reality. This will, or wish, helps to condition the treatment of, and attitude toward, immortality. For many reasons it was no longer easy to presuppose this doctrine as revealed fact and man's true end. By 1513 it had to be dogmatically re affirmed by the Lateran Council, and Pomponazzi's famous critique appeared in 1516. It may seem that Florentine Neoplatonism was one of the strongholds in which this dogma was sustained, but in fact Ficino gave the concept a strong this-worldly orientation which influenced Pico and many others. Castiglione's Bembo brings this out quite clearly when he says, "let us die a happy death in life" (italics mine). In his Renaissance Thought (1961), Kristeller, who has frequently and thoroughly discussed the question, re veals this orientation as much in his phrasing as in his explicit analysis: Ficino does not condemn or minimize the practical activi ties of life, but he states with great emphasis that the main 60</page><page sequence="24">PICO AND NEOPLATONIST IDEALISM purpose of human life is contemplation. By contemplation he understands a spiritual experience which begins with a detachment of our mind from the outside world, which then proceeds through various degrees of knowledge and desire, and finally culminates in the immediate vision and enjoy ment of God. Since this final union with God is rarely at tained during the present life, Ficino postulates a future life in which this aim will be attained in a permanent fashion by all those who made the necessary effort during the present life. The immortality of the soul thus becomes the center of Ficino's philosophy, because immortality is needed to justify his interpretation of human existence as a continuing effort of contemplation. Without immortality, that effort would be vain, and human existence would be without any attainable end. (pp. 129-130, italics mine.) Immortality is important not as a truth of revelation and dogma but as a dialectical or systematic (or perhaps rhetori cal) function which reinforces the value of special experi ences attainable in this life. This reverses the emphasis of Christian mystics from the Gospel Age through the fif teenth century, for whom the moments of vision in this life were merely pledges of the more abiding bliss to come. It does not seem that Ficino was aware of these implica tions, and this may be due partly to a semantic confusion inherent in his work. For example, he frequently affirms the soul's need to separate itself from matter in order to ful fill its longing, return to its natural place and see God. But this idea of separation is also applied to a quite dif ferent process: when the soul internalizes the universe it separates lower things from their material bondage by con verting them to mental images, then to symbols of higher things. The first is a mystical, the second an epistemological statement, and it is hard to avoid the feeling that the first is developed by metaphoric extension from the second. Thus the following passage seems susceptible of either interpreta tion: animus . . . investiget quoque supernas causas, earumque effectus: item ab effectibus inferioribus per medias causas us que ad causam supremam ascendat: atque vicissim a suprema 6l</page><page sequence="25">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW causa usque ad Ínfimos eventus circulo remeet. (Th. Plat. IX. 6, Opera Omnia, p. 218.) He may have in mind simply the theory that the soul possesses all things as objects of thought, a power accounted for not only by reflection but also by innate "imagines . . . divino rum, a quibus ipsa dependit," and "inferiorum rationes &amp; exemplaria: quae quodammodo &amp; ipsa producit." But he may also have in mind a more literal ranging of the sort suggested in such phrases as "transit in omnia" and "dum in alia migrat, non deserit alia: sed migrat in singula: ac semper cuneta conservat." These claims sound Hermetic, and it is not easy for us to take them seriously when we compare them to the more viable and metaphoric statements which de rive from the assumptions of earlier epistemology. The point is that Ficino seems to be more serious and literal about epistemology than about ontology, mystical theology and eschatology even though he does not think this is the case; he seems to be concerned mainly and primarily with the processes of consciousness, even though his avowed interest is directed toward, and phrased in the language of, more traditional and metaphysical topics. Thus he frequently speculates about the vision after life when man, like the angels, will view the whole at once, freed from the limitations of temporal duration and mortal perspective. But his own philosophic activity suggests that he is really more concerned with the vision produced in this life when, after restless striving, the philosopher's ratio embraces the universe, re conciles different points of view and completes the har monious world picture unfolded in his discursive record, the Theologica Platónica and the Opera Omnia. In this context, to make the soul "return to" God is a program which may be satisfied when the soul's highest power, specu latio, which operates without the help of bodily instruments, is given full play, since speculatio resembles the activity of the divine mind. This semantic confusion, which approaches magic, seems clearly to have been shared by Pico and Bruno, 6 2</page><page sequence="26">PICO AND NEOPLATONIST IDEALISM and to be connected with what can only be called the green-world idealism of the Renaissance Neoplatonists. 2) Renaissance Neoplatonists, for various reasons, lack a true dialogal sense; their work spreads out from the self in a dominantly unidirectional manner, as exemplified above in the case of Pico. This becomes explicit and self-conscious in Bruno, for whom the individual philosophic quest had priority over anything which might be received, whether from tradition, antiquity, the church or God. In Bruno the mono logal thrust toward "infinite Being" becomes a program which, separated from his life, loses the kind of realistic or tragic dimension which might have rendered the oeuvre significant in its own right. The work, standing alone, pro jects the image of the Overreacher in caricature form. There is more conflict, more confusion, between the intentions and the accomplishments of Ficino and Pico; had they evolved different strategies of language and thought, had they adequately embodied their intentions in their work, their achievement might have been as rich in itself as it was in its historical influence. What both required, and both lacked, were methods of "otherating" the divine, methods which would allow them to approach God without diminish ing his transcendence. One has the rather odd feeling, in reading Ficino and Pico, that while they imagine them selves to be climbing up the ladder to God, God is actually lowering the ladder while they climb in place. Methodolog ical slogans like "becoming God by becoming all things" too often lead their proponents to cross the insufficiently defined boundary separating metaphor or analogy from the ological fact. This monologal tendency has interesting effects in other contexts. There is, for example, a wide gap between Ficino as translator and as commentator, and virtually no gap be tween Ficino as commentator and as philosopher. He has not achieved the middle way of historical perspectivism which was to mark the origins of modern scholarship. He extends his own syncretic thought uncritically back into his 63</page><page sequence="27">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW sources. If this is in itself a medieval failing, there is a crucial difference in the historical circumstances: Ficino possessed new sources, complete texts, the materials for a more objective history of thought. The question of the re lation between ancient and modern, sources and self, arises for him as it did not for earlier thinkers, but he does not come to grips with it. The most familiar and influential instance of this failure is of course his commentary on Plato's Symposium, known as De Amore. Here Ficino plays the roles of his friends who "explain" (exponerent) the speeches of the seven participants in the original dialogue. All the "explanations" in fact develop Ficino's own version of the philosophy of eros, which draws more from Plotinus than from Plato. Though he makes a pretense of recording and interpreting the ideas of others, it is his own viewpoint which he reads into the utterance of his friends and back into "Plato." The peculiar quasi-actual status of Ficino's banquet produces an effect quite different from the quasi historical status of the symposium which Plato's speaker "recalls." Ficino's monologal tendency is most tellingly revealed in his theory of friendship, which I should like to contrast to an example of a truly dialogal theory, that of St. Thomas Aquinas. The latter's three questions on the nature, cause and effects of love in the Summa Theologica (I-II, 26-28) are chiefly concerned to show how there can be a union which does not destroy, but on the contrary enhances, the otherness and independence of persons in love. Statements about union are always qualified, and even when they appear in the objections to be answered, the replies do not question the qualification: love is a kind of union. . . . But a union or bond is not a passion, but rather a relation. Therefore love is not a passion. (26, 2, obj. 2) Union belongs to love in so far as by reason of the complac ency of the appetite, the lover stands in relation to that which he loves, as though it were himself or part of himself. 64</page><page sequence="28">PICO AND NEOPLATONIST IDEALISM Hence it is clear that love is not the very relation of union, but that union is a result of love. (Ibid., ad 2, italics mine) love does not cause union of essence; else love could not be between things essentially distinct. the lover in act is not the beloved in act. Therefore union is the effect of knowledge rather than of love. (28, 1, obj. 2 and 3) There is a . . . substantial union, as regards the love with which one loves oneself; while as regards the love wherewith one loves other things, it is the union of likeness. . . . There is also a union which is essentially love itself. This union is . . . likened to substantial union, inasmuch as the lover stands to the object of his love, as to himself. . . . Again there is a union, which is the effect of love. This is real union, which the lover seeks with the object of his love. Moreover this union is in keeping with the demands of love: for as the Philosopher relates . . ., Aristophanes stated that lovers would wish to be united both into one, but since this would result in either one or both being destroyed, they seek a suitable and becoming union;—to live together, speak to gether, and be united together in other like things. Knowledge is perfected by the thing known being united, through its likeness to the knower. But the effect of love is that the thing itself which is loved, is, in a way, united to the lover. . . . Consequently the union caused by love is closer than that which is caused by knowledge. (Ibid., ad 2 and 3, italics mine) The second reply is especially interesting for the echo of the Symposium transmitted through Aristotle. Aquinas cites as evidence precisely that serio-comic myth of the divided sexes which the remainder of the dialogue resolves in a typically Platonic way, that is, by climbing up the ladder. Even more peculiar is the hint that the love in question is between man and woman; this is no doubt not the way St. Thomas read the passage. In discussing the sacraments he adopts the normal medieval attitude toward marriage: "Matrimony ... a remedy against concupiscence in the in dividual, and against the decease in numbers that results 65</page><page sequence="29">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW from death" (S. T. Ill, 65, 1 resp.). As its Latin roots sug gest, matrimony, or marriage, refers less to a relationship between persons than to the maternal (material) function of the female and the generative (form-giving) function of the male (mas, maris; maritus). The discussion of love, on the other hand, has to do with a relationship between equals, a communion between independent persons in which the other is loved as a "second self." For this, Aquinas naturally relies on Aristotle's theory of friendship. The respect and disinterested love of friends has nothing to do with sexual love; what is more important, it is treated as an end in itself; one's friendship for another person may be proper or improper, may be a figure of one's love for God (S.T. II-II, 23, 1), but it is never treated as a rung on the Neo-platonic ladder. Ficino's treatment of friendship in the De Amore has mistakenly been read as homosexual, on the other hand, because it is described in such erotic metaphors; but the purpose of this is to express the power of God's attraction, the frustration produced by any earthly attach ment in the lover who has once taken the bait of Beauty. Aristotle's theory allows St. Thomas to distinguish between two kinds of attraction which are blurred in the De Amore. There is the fact of desire, which implies something lacking and which draws one toward the thing desired in the hope of making that other a part of the self; but there is also the quite different fact of friendship which is based not pri marily on longing for an unpossessed object, but on love of the self. So, after describing the various sentiments that comprise friendship, Aristotle concludes: It is . . . because the good man has these various feelings towards himself, and because he feels towards his friend in the same way as toward himself (for a friend is another self), that friendship ... is thought to consist in one or other of these feelings, and the possession of them is thought to be the test of a friend. The self-love in friendship differs from the self-love of desire, 66</page><page sequence="30">PICO AND NEOPLATONIST IDEALISM for in the first, the other is treated as self, while in the second, the other is reduced to an object: the movement of love has a twofold tendency: towards the good which a man wishes to someone,—to himself or to another, and towards that to which he wishes some good. Ac cordingly, man has love of concupiscence towards the good that he wishes to another, and love of friendship, towards him to whom he wishes good . . . that which is loved with the love of friendship is loved simply and for itself; whereas that which is loved with the love of concupiscence, is loved, not simply and for itself, but for something else. (S.T. I-II, 26, 4, resp.) The clarity of the distinction depends, for Aquinas, on avoiding any suggestion of erotic desire, which belongs to the class of desires directed toward inferior things. There can be "no friendship for wine and suchlike things," as he remarks in the sed contra of the same article, after quoting Aristotle: "A man is said to love wine, on account of its sweetness which he desires." The analysis of the relationship between lovers is kept in the masculine gender, and this emphasizes the attachment based on equality as against that based on want and inclination. "One kind of likeness arises from each thing having the same quality actually," and this causes "love of friendship or well-being": For the very fact that two men are alike, having, as it were, one form, makes them to be, in a manner, one in that form: thus two men are one thing in the species of humanity. . . . Hence the affections of one tend to the other, as being one with him; and he wishes good to him as to himself. In such love which is by analogy or proportion, each friend loves by remaining within himself yet being aware that what he loves is a person other than himself. But a second kind of likeness "arises from one thing having potentially and by way of inclination, a quality which the other has actually," as when wine possesses the sweetness desired by taste, or a woman "possesses" the imagined pleasure prom ised by her beautiful appearance: 67</page><page sequence="31">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW the second kind of likeness causes love of concupiscence, or friendship founded on usefulness or pleasure: because what ever is in potentiality, as such, has the desire for its act; and it takes pleasure in its realization, if it be a sentient and cog nitive being. (I-II, 27, 3, resp.) Both kinds of love or likeness belong to the actual relation of friendship, as we see when Aquinas discusses "mutual indwelling"—that is, the way in which love causes separate persons to be "within" one another: the object loved is said to be in the lover, inasmuch as it is in his affections . . . because the complacency in the beloved is rooted in the lover's heart. . . . On the other hand, the lover is in the beloved, by the love of concupiscence and by the love of friendship, but not in the same way. For the love of concupis cence is not satisfied with any external or superficial posses sion or enjoyment of the beloved; but seeks to possess the beloved perfectly, by penetrating into his heart, as it were. Whereas, in the love of friendship, the lover is in the beloved, inasmuch as he reckons what is good or evil to his friend, as being so to himself; and his friend's will as his own, so that it seems as though he felt the good or suffered the evil in the person of his friend. (I-II, 28, 2, resp.) By making it clear that the oneness of two lovers is meta phorical rather than metaphysical, sentimental rather than substantial, Aquinas shows how love derives its origin and its very meaning from the irrevocable distinctness of per sons; he also shows how, through the complicated psychic process of mutual indwelling, each lover can be "alone together," can sustain a "dialogue of one." In the De Amore, Ficino also discusses likeness and mutual indwelling, and devotes most of the fourth speech to Aris tophanes' myth of the demi-men. Though many of his in dividual conceptions are naturally similar to those of St. Thomas, the context of thought shows them to be working toward—or from—an opposite set of principles. Where Aquinas is concerned to keep lovers apart, Ficino's aim is to dissolve the otherness of a beloved self by reducing it to an object of thought. Since the lover's basic urge is for absolute 68</page><page sequence="32">PICO AND NEOPLATONIST IDEALISM union with God, the theory of friendship has to serve this end: respect and love cannot be for the self, the person, of the beloved so much as for something separable from him and much more important than his individual existence: the passion of a lover is not quenched by the mere touch or sight of a body, for it does not desire this or that body, but desires the splendor of the divine light shining through bodies. ... For this reason lovers never know what it is they desire or seek, for they do not know God Himself.... It . . . often happens that the lover wishes to transform him self into the person of the loved one. This is really quite reasonable, for he wishes and tries to become God instead of man; and who would not exchange humanity for divinity? If we love bodies, the Soul, or the Angelic Mind, we do not really love these, but God in them... .10 This means that the love of friendship, the idea of twin selves "horizontally" related, is of much less consequence than the sharp vertical inclination which moves the mortal creature toward the potential immortality, the permanent union with God, which he lacks on earth. And such an ascent abolishes the need for a concept of twin selves: when the individual mind attains to the level of its objective correlate, the Angelic Mind (Nous, Mens Mundana), it apprehends the single exemplar not yet divided into the subsequent multiplicity of individual forms. The aim of likeness and reciprocity in love, the abstrac tion of one form from two bodies, is thus contrary to that of the Aristotelian theory of friendship. The axis of ascent is located within each lover by virtue of the innate formulae which, since they are Ideas, are much purer than their inferior counterparts in the concrete world. This adds a certain inequality to the attraction through likeness: love— the mean between Poverty and Plenty—is always of the beautiful. The old man is the lover of the young, the less ío II.6 and VI.19, tr. by Sears R. Jayne, Marsilio Ficino's Commentary on Plato's Symposium, University of Missouri Studies, vol. XIX, no. 1, Columbia, 1944, 140-141 and 215. 6g</page><page sequence="33">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW beautiful of the more beautiful, because the lover sees re flected in the external form what he is trying to find and see in his own soul. Thus the concrete forms of nature provide merely the first step (though it is an important step) in the reflexive act of recollection. In describing the self-sufficiency of the lover, Ficino models his advice on the classical prin ciple of artistic selection, familiar through the often-repeated anecdote of Zeuxis and the Crotonian virgins. But he gives it what might be called a Mannerist twist, because the selection does not perfect what was immanent though in complete in nature; on the contrary, it arouses and unfolds an object peculiar to the order of mind: if you observe men individually, you will praise none of them in every detail. Whatever is right anywhere you will gather together and you will make up a whole figure in your mind from the observation of all . . . so that the absolute beauty of the human species, which is found here and there in many bodies, will be gathered together in your soul in the concep tion of one image. You value little the beauty of each man ... if you compare it with your Idea. You possess that (Idea), not thanks to bodies, but thanks to your own soul. So love that image which your soul created and that soul itself, its creator, rather than that crippled and scattered exterior. (VI. 18, Jayne, p. 213, italics mine.) 3) In the first two chapters of his study of Renaissance philosophy, Cassirer has described with great force the his torical significance of Cusanus and some of the main con nections between his thought and that of the Florentine Neoplatonists. Cassirer's interest in the development of early modern idealism, however, leads him to move from Cusanus' emphasis on self-limitation toward those more optimistic theses about the nature and power of man which were embraced by Ficino and Pico. Since what is new is the attention given to the mind's self-sufficiency, its germinal possession of all things and its ability to unfold them through experience, the form of Cassirer's exposition is itself na turally impelled along the rising vector, for example: 70</page><page sequence="34">PICO AND NEOPLATONIST IDEALISM the proof of the mind's specific perfection consists in its re fusal to stand still at any attained goal and in its constant questioning and striving beyond the goal. ... In this thought, perhaps, the basic Faustian attitude of the Renaissance re ceived its clearest philosophical expression and its deepest philosophical justification. The striving for the infinite, the inability to stop at anything given or attained is neither a fault nor a shortcoming of the mind; rather, it is the seal of its divine origin and of its indestructibility . . . this basic and characteristic Renaissance motif ... is at the centre of Leon ardo's theory of art, and at the centre of Ficino's philosophical doctrine of immortality. (Individual, p. 69.) For the purposes of the present discussion it will be useful to reaffirm here the context of self-limitation within which Cusanus developed his more "Faustian" ideas. This may be done by citing three methodological axioms which guided his thought: a) between the absolute maximum (God) and the relative maximum (the universe), between the infinite and the finite, the creator and the created, there can be no mean except that which God himself chose to create in Jesus (Docta Ignorantia and De Pace seu Concordantia Fidei). Since no human image of the divine can leap the gap and reproduce the original, b) the mind must begin by acknowl edging the perspectivist character of its relation (De Fisione Dei and De Beryllo): as everything appears red to the physical eye when it looks through a red glass, so the spiritual eye, in its limitedness, sees you, the goal and object of the mind's observation, according to the nature of its own limitation. Man is capable only of human judgment. . . . Ah, God, how wonderful is your face: the youth, if he would conceive of it, must imagine it as young, the man as male, the old man as old. In all faces the face of faces appears, veiled, as in an enigma—but it cannot be seen uncovered unless it be when we go beyond all faces to that secret, dark silence, wherein nothing remains of the knowledge and the concept of face. If this passage, especially in its final sentence, reveals its debt to the devotio moderna of earlier German mystics, it also points toward the Neoplatonists. For Pico, as we have seen, 71</page><page sequence="35">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW the limits of perspectivism exist in order to be overcome, though the darkness of the via negativa tends to be dis pelled by a relatively anthropomorphic brightness. c) The third and perhaps most significant axiom is that which Edgar Wind has described in Pagan Mysteries as serio ludere: "In order to guide the mind toward the hidden God, Cusanus invented experiments in metaphor, semi magical exercises which would solemnly entertain and astonish the beholder. These serious games consisted in finding within common experience an unusual object en dowed with the kind of contradictory attributes which are difficult to imagine united in the deity" (p. 179). One of Wind's major concerns in Pagan Mysteries is to show the extent to which the men of letters who revived the pagan mysteries in the Renaissance "had learned from Plato that the deepest things are best spoken of in a tone of irony" (p. 189). He distinguishes three meanings of the term "mysteries" available to these men, the ritual, the figurative and the magical: 1) "The first and original meaning of mysteries, which is exemplified by the festival of Eleusis, is that of a popular ritual of initiation. In it the neophytes were purged of the fear of death and admitted into the com pany of the blessed, to which they were bound by a vow of silence" (p. 13). 2) Plato is chiefly responsible for making "figurative use of terms and images which were borrowed from the popular rites but transferred to the intellectual disciplines of philosophical debate and mediation. In a half serious, half-playful appraisal of himself the philosopher took on the attitude of a new hierophant" (pp. 14-15). 3) the adoption of a ritual terminology to assist and incite the exercise of intelligence proved exceedingly useful as a fiction, but ended, as such fictions are likely to do, by be traying the late Platonists into a revival of magic. ... If the soul could be induced by a certain kind of poetic hymn to rise to a state of philosophic enthusiasm in which it could commune with the Beyond, then a similar force might be claimed also for the magical skills of incantation, for the art of invoking sacred names or numbers, or of ... 72</page><page sequence="36">PICO AND NEOPLATONIST IDEALISM casting spells by drawing figures or by manipulating mag ical tools, (pp. 15-16.) Though "in the literature transmitted to the Renaissance the three phases were already thoroughly mixed," Wind finds that "among the great Renaissance antiquaries . . . the figurative understanding was upheld ... as basic," and he attributes this to the naiveté with which they projected their own preferences back into the ancient sources: Whenever 'the mysteries of the ancients' were invoked by De Bussi, Beroaldo, Perotti, or Landino, not to mention Ficino or Pico della Mirándola, their concern was less with the orig inal mystery cults than with their philosophical adaptation. Good judgment alone did not impose the restriction; it was largely a case of good luck, for it derived from a historical misconception: they mistook the figurative interpretation as inherent in the original mysteries. . . . Plato appeared to them not as a critic or transposer of mysteries, but as the heir and oracle of an ancient wisdom for which a ritual disguise had been invented by the founders of the mysteries themselves, (pp. 16-17.) It seems clear, however, that Ficino and Pico did not understand the implications of serio ludere as well as Cus anus or Plato did. They did not, at least, see how its con sequences could be fruitfully translated into a method of production, formally and structurally embodied in their opera. Like so many of their contemporaries, they took an essentially Roman and medieval view of the concept of the poetic, which they identified with the rhetorical or meta phoric—Pico's well-known censure of ornamental style as merely manmade (in contrast to divine symbols) is a case in point. What they failed to appreciate was the potential usefulness of the poetic as fictional, counterfactual, hypo thetical, heterocosmic. Properly understood, serio ludere protects the mind from slipping into magic by keeping it alive to the fact that its symbols are only symbols, its fictions only fictions. Serio ludere also entails taking whatever game one plays very seriously, both for its own sake and as a model of activities which may be more general or significant. The 73</page><page sequence="37">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW game, that is, is pleasurable in itself and profitable as an analogy. So long as these two functions are clearly distin guished from each other, so long as the player recognizes the game is only a game, and stays within its prescribed limits, he may concentrate all the more intently on mastering its tech niques and exploring its possibilities. Yet at the same time, he may with equal fervor climb the ladder and pursue the ideal, the Utopian, the "supersensible" or "supramundane" without deceiving himself as to the nature of his accomplish ment. The problem, in Wind's terms, is thus to unmix the three phases of the mysteries, to establish the figurative as distinct from the ritual or magical, to acknowledge it as basic precisely because "figurative" means confessedly fictional, artificial, mindmade. What is required is not Pico's syncretic goal of a Poetic Theology; this is a dialectical half way house which, by exposing the full force and weakness of its green-world idealism, leads through critique toward a more viable situation: Poetry and Theology (or Mysticism), each knowing itself distinct from the other and thus able without confusion to utilize the disciplines of the other. The attitude of serio ludere might well be posited as the impulse behind much that is new and historically significant in renaissance thought: the reorganization of relations be tween understanding and doing, contemplation and action, theory and practice; the greater dignity and emphasis ac corded to method and technique, to technology and experi ment, to the possibilities of a particular discipline or a parti cular medium, etc.; the development of the heterocosm as the play- or questing-ground which the individual mind cir cumscribes both to pursue its inquiries and to manifest in formal and structural terms its experience of pursuit. To cite a few examples, such an attitude at work in the visual and literary arts obviously informs the theory—Alberti, Pico, Leonardo, Mazzoni, Tasso, Sidney, Spenser, Shake speare, Cervantes, Jonson—as well as the practice of the period. Serio ludere might well be the slogan not only of Montaigne but also of Castiglione, whose Book of the 74</page><page sequence="38">PICO AND NEOPLATONIST IDEALISM Courtier is concerned less with the Neoplatonic seriousness of Bembo's discourse than with a Machiavellian seriousness which sees games as essential to survival. Castiglione's pur pose is reflected more clearly in the words of Cesare Gon zaga than in those of Bembo: we have seen it happen in this house that many who were at first held to be very wise have been known, in the course of time, to be full of folly, and this came about through nothing save the attention we gave to it. . . . whenever we have detected some hidden trace of folly, [we] have simulated it so artfully . . . that finally we have understood what its tendency was; then ... we agitated it so thoroughly that it was always brought to the perfection of an open folly . . . wherein, as you know, we have had some wonderful entertainment. . . . Hence, I wish that for this evening our game might be a discussion of this matter, and that each would say: 'In case I should openly reveal my folly, what sort mine would be and about what. ..'; and let the same be said of all the others, keeping to the order of our games, and let each one seek to base his opinion on some real sign and evidence. Thus, each of us will profit from this game of ours by knowing his faults, the better thereby to guard against them. (I. 8, tr. C. S. Single ton, 1959, pp. 20-21.) Like the games it represents, Castiglione's book is by no means an elegant image of escape from actuality—the at tention critics have given to Bembo's Ficinian speech has been both excessive and inaccurate—but a controlled with drawal allowing its participants to perfect their defenses within the pleasant, secure and temporary green world of their friendly circle. What is most important to Castiglione is not the mere image of the ideal courtier, not the various theories about proper behavior, not even the individual parcels of instruction, but rather the whole method which the book exemplifies as well as demonstrates. The Book of the Courtier is usually misunderstood because its readers tend to take its literary form, its concrete presence as a work, less seriously than did Castiglione. As his prefaces make clear, the friendly circle survives for the author only 75</page><page sequence="39">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW in il libro, the circle of his memory and imagination to which he himself manifestly withdraws. The achievement of Ficino and Pico stands in relation to the great monuments of Renaissance imagination as do pre faces to great works. It is easy enough to state the new aims and new programs in fine prefatory rhetoric, more difficult to demonstrate them in the processes of thought, style and experience—that is, in the works which embody these pro cesses. Modern historians of ideas are sometimes cavalier about this distinction, and they might well profit from Leibniz' acute remarks about Patrizzi: a man of admirable views . . . who lacked the learning nec essary to pursue them. He wanted to correct the ways of dem onstrating things in Geometry, he had indeed seen that there was something lacking in them, and he wanted to do some thing also for Metaphysics, but he lacked the strength. The preface of his New Geometry, dedicated to the Duke of Fer rara, is admirable, but the contents are pitiful. Cassirer applies the same distinction positively to Kepler and relates it to the astronomer's own awareness of the importance of serio ludere: Kepler's esoteric beliefs and Neoplatonic speculations may have been important from the standpoint of psychological motivation, but none of this is really significant. The real emancipation is ac complished in Kepler's work. And it could be accomplished there only because Kepler stood for a new and stricter ideal of truth. Kepler himself tells us that in his first studies of planetary motion he had arrived at an hypothesis which for mulated all his observations with sufficient accuracy: the error amounted to only eight minutes. . . . But he was not satisfied, and went further: "Those eight minutes," he himself says, "became the beginning of the whole new astronomy." It was thus a new demand for "precision" which gave birth to Kepler's laws. And so there grew up a new and stricter sci entific critique of all pictorial and symbolic ideas, a clearer recognition of what symbols can and cannot do. "Ludo quippe et ego symbolis," Kepler says in a letter, "sed ita ludo, ut me ludere non obliviscar. Nihil enim probatur symbolis; 76</page><page sequence="40">PICO AND NEOPLATONIST IDEALISM nihil abstrusi eruitur in naturali philosophia per symbola geométrica. . . ."11 It is not only his accidental interest in two different modes of activity but his self-consciousness about it, his ability to shift back and forth between them, to honor their differences yet make use of them, which sets Kepler apart from what in comparison is the mere preface-work of Bruno and Fludd. As A. C. Crombie has pointed out in Medieval and Early Modern Science, it was not the gratuitous interest in ex periments, but the fact that this interest was felt to be scientifically valuable, which set apart the scientists of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries from their medieval predecessors: Undirected experiments and simple everyday observations abound in the work of medieval scientists. Certainly there was no general movement to conceive of experimental inquiry as a sustained testing of a series of precisely and quantitatively formulated hypotheses, pressing on to the reformulation of a whole area of theory. The examples of experimental inquir ies, even the best of them, remained isolated without general effect on the accepted doctrines of light or of cosmology. They were thought sufficient to illustrate the method, and meth odology was an end to itself. It would have become a dead end had not Galileo and his contemporaries, with a new di rection of interest, pursued the subjects of the examples for their own sakes. It was through taking these seriously, through paying attention to the detailed facts of experiment and measurement and mathematical functions actually exempli fied in nature, that the 17th century scientists were led to their radical revolution.... Thus, early in the first day of the Dialogues Concerning Two New Sciences, Galileo has Sagredo use the serio ludere argument to encourage Salviati to digress: SALV. To solve the problems which you raise it will be necessary to make a digression into subjects which have little bearing upon our present purpose. SAGR. But if, by digressions, we can reach new truth, what ii "Some Remarks on the Question of the Originality of the Renaissance," JHI, Vol. IV, No. i (January, 1943), 53. 77</page><page sequence="41">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW harm is there in making one now, so that we may not lose this knowledge, remembering that such an opportunity, once omitted, may not return; remembering also that we are not tied down to a fixed and brief method but that we meet solely for our own entertainment? Indeed, who knows but that we may thus frequently discover something more interesting and beautiful than the solution originally sought? (Tr. H. Crew and A. De Salvio, New York 1914, pp. 7-8.) The openness which marks the apparent structure of the treatise is analogous to the open and tentative method whereby Galileo again and again withdraws to a hypotheti cal play-world which he recognizes at once as counterfactual and as the only way to arrive at the reality behind phenom ena, for example: SALV. ... If therefore this experiment is to be made with accuracy it should be performed in a vacuum where every heavy body exhibits its momentum without the slightest di minution. If then, Simplicio, we were to weigh a portion of air in a vacuum would you then be satisfied and assured of the fact? SIMP. Yes truly: but this is to wish or ask the impossible. I grant that . . . conclusions proved in the abstract will be different when applied to the concrete and will be [to some extent] fallacious.... (pp. 81, 251.) What Salviati asks his companions to visualize is not the situation in nature, but the situation in a controlled experi ment: "Imagine this page to represent a vertical wall, with a nail driven into it . . ." (p. 170). Experimental withdrawal, however, can be justified only by the phase of return to actual nature, which for Galileo means applying the principle of correction: if we consider only the resistance which the air offers to the motions studied by us, we shall see that it disturbs them in an infinite variety of ways . . . hence, in order to handle this matter in a scientific way, it is necessary to cut loose from these difficulties; and having discovered and demonstrated the theorems, in the case of no resistance, to use them and apply them with such limitations as experience will teach. ... I now proceed to the consideration of motions through the air.... (pp. 252-253.) 78</page><page sequence="42">PICO AND NEOPLATONIST IDEALISM As a final example of serio ludere in the field of scientific inquiry, we may glance at Gilbert's method of withdrawal through the eyes of Sir Kenelm Digby who, in 1658, acutely discerned its significance: all the knowledge he got of this subject, was by forming a little loadstone into the shape of the earth. By which means he compassed a wonderfull designe, which was, to make the whole globe of the earth maniable: for he found the proper ties of the whole earth, in that little body; which he therefore called a Terrella, or little earth; and which he could manage and try experiments upon, at his will. And in like manner, any man that hath an aim to advance much in natural sci ences, must endeavor to draw the matter he inquireth of, into some small model, or some kind of manageable method; which he may turn and wind as he pleaseth.12 As demonstrated by the sixth book of the De Magnete, of course, Gilbert's return to actuality was inadequate, since the principle of correction was not applied rigorously enough, but Digby's statement heads us in the right direction. Serio ludere, in whatever field it exerts force as a motive, demands primarily a commitment to the work—both pro cess and product—and to whatever "truth" emerges from this commitment. Commitment to one's work must be greater than, or at least equal to, commitment to one's life, but not greater than commitment to life. The specialization involved in mastering a particular set of techniques and methods conditioned by the particular medium of work one chooses— this specialization itself should become a moment of con sciousness leading beyond itself. Thus, for example, a more intense concentration on literary, artistic, philosophical or scientific technique should theoretically produce a more in tense awareness that one is specializing, that whatever "truth" or "reality" one apprehends is limited by the conditions which the work imposes. This implies a formal exigency, namely, that the work ought to display this awareness; in order to effect this, one must learn the various techniques of 12 Two Treatises . . . [on] The Nature of Bodies . . . [and] The Nature of Man's Soul, London, 1658, p. 225. 79</page><page sequence="43">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW closure or circumscription whereby the work suggests its limits and points beyond itself. Furthermore, the work, like a picture plane, must be structured so as to draw into its field what is initially "on both sides" of it, that is, subject and object, or self and other. It is at this point that the serio ludere axiom makes close contact with the conditions and imperatives of a true perspectivism. I should like to illuminate this contact with the following two modern state ments drawn from quite different contexts, statements whose juxtaposition may suggest something about the close relation ship between formal and intellectual imperatives: the "subjectivist bias of modern philosophy" can only be re conciled with realism if we can find a way of reconciling the fact that all knowledge is perspectival with the fact that knowledge is about objects distinct from and independent of the experiencing subject. ... it is logically impossible that there should be a description of reality which is not a de scription from a perspective which is one among alternative perspectives—[this fact] does not involve a surrender to ideal ism. To grant this consequence ... to show that it is com patible with the claim that reality remains distinct from, and independent of, our knowledge about it is to defeat [the idealist] . . . our knowledge may be about an independent reality without its being the case that it is even logically pos sible that this reality should be described independently of the observer's perspective... .13 Poetic symbols . . . call attention to themselves as symbols and in themselves invite evaluation. What may seem stranger is that the verbal symbol in calling attention to itself must also call attention to the difference between itself and the reality which it resembles and symbolizes. ... In most dis course we look right through this disparity. There is one-way transparent intellectual reference. But poetry by thickening the medium increases the disparity between itself and its referents. Iconicity enforces disparity. The symbol has more substance than a noniconic symbol and hence is more clearly 13 Richard N. Rorty, "The Subjectivist Principle and the Linguistic Turn," Alfred North Whitehead, ed. by G. L. Kline, Englewood Cliffs, N. J., 1963, p. 153 8o</page><page sequence="44">PICO AND NEOPLATONIST IDEALISM realized as a thing separate from its referents and as one of the productions of our own spirit.14 I submit these statements as commonplaces of modern thought. When Cusanus made a statement very similar to Rorty's (see p. 71 above) it was not a commonplace, and the various kinds of consequence to which it could lead had not been explored. If one such consequence is embodied in the above statement, another quite different consequence appears in the neo-idealism of Cassirer. My own feeling is that the more viable perspectivism is first chiefly worked out in the practi cal domain of the various arts and sciences, and also in the broader context of the Reformation seen as a movement which fulfills or sublates the kind of Renaissance thought identified with Ficino and Pico. It might be noted in passing that the idea of commitment is caught up and modified in the very important Reformation concept of the calling. Language, poetry, philosophy and scientific inquiry may be seen primarily under the aspect of statement or primarily under the aspect of action. That is, each may be viewed as a mold into which one puts one's experiences, ideas, images, etc., and therefore as a medium which expresses and com municates a finished product; or, on the other hand, each may be viewed as the record of the process through which one arrived at the finished product. Doing philosophy, for example, may be conceived as working out and then present ing to an audience one's philosophical views or system; or it may be conceived as presenting to an audience the image of oneself working out one's philosophical views or system. The latter, with its self-reference, is the Platonic way in which philosophy cannot be separated from philosophizing. Modern perspectival realism would seem to entail a return to this Platonic way, and I think it is clear that Ficino and Pico follow Cusanus in taking a first step along this way— the way of perspectival idealism in which the role of the self is stressed at the expense of the phenomenological reality of " W. K. Wimsatt, Jr., "Verbal Style: Logical and Counterlogical," The Verbal Icon, Lexington, Ky., 1954, p. 217. 81</page><page sequence="45">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW the other. But the step they take has itself the quality of a preface or a programmatic statement rather than the quality of action. A program for experience is not the same as the experience; a program for contemplation or meditation differs from contemplative or meditative action; descriptive or methodo logical assertions about climbing the ladder are not the same as climbing the ladder. Pico tends to conflate program with action, and to confuse talking about philosophy with doing philosophy. The central image which emerges from Pico's opera—with the possible exception of the In Astrologiam— is not the world view which Pico sets forth but rather Pico setting forth his world view. The man-centered character of his philosophy and the self-centered character of his method are in a peculiarly accurate way projections of this failure to keep his eye on the object, to sustain the indepen dence and otherness of the reality outside mind or beyond self, whether this reality be natural, cultural or divine. This failure is intimately bound up with what is new and signi ficant in Pico's thought, which—as Cassirer has so persuasively argued—is the relocation of culture- and world-making activ ity within the now of the thinking self, the establishment of epistemology as the basic point of departure for the elaboration of Weltanschauung. But, apart from any personal failings, there is a formal exigency in a relocation of this sort which Pico misses, and which perhaps he could not be expected to note except on historical retrospect: When philosophy is understood as the experience of philosophizing, when the criteria of certainty or objectivity shift from tradition and dogma to controlled inner experience, when the limitations on what the mind can do and make are no longer presupposed as the beginning and end of its activity, then it must reconstruct criteria and limitations on a new model. Intellectual, volitional and emotional strategies of self-limitation must be newly elaborated along with a style through which they may be expressed. If Pico is one of the protogenitors of symbolic-form philosophy, if he anticipates 82</page><page sequence="46">PICO AND NEOPLATONIST IDEALISM Montaigne's conscious analyses of the concrete now and Descartes' formulation of Cogito ergo sum, it makes all the difference in the world that he did not restrict his focus as Montaigne did, that he did not utter to himself the magic Cartesian formula. Descartes of course ended up roughly where Pico did in his attempt to objectify his own system and attribute it to a God who must thereby be no other than a projected Cartesian system-builder. Descartes faced the problem of reconstructing the real within the limits of a method restricted to subjective certainty, and he unfortu nately overcame the restriction by an arbitrary act of will, a fiat. But the immediate and positive result of his confron tation was that, both in method and in world view, he analyzed experience into a number of clear and distinct areas, each with its own character and procedures, each imposing a unique set of rules on the mind, rules determined by the nature of the constructed—or reconstructed—object. Descartes' method and philosophy are thus deliberate externalizations of his attempt to meet the problem posed by the cogito, where Pico's are more or less intuitive projections of his ignorance of the fact that the problem confronted him. The result in Pico's work is a habitual conflation of areas originally clear and distinct, a continual metamorphosis in mental and verbal style whereby theology, philosophy, poetry and magic restlessly exchange places and natures. 83</page></plain_text>
