<plain_text><page sequence="1">by Edwin Berry Bur gum LITERARY FORM Social Forces and Innovations CCERTAIN novelties in the structure of contemporary lit:? j^ erature, especially the fiction and the drama of common life, point, I believe, to the emergence of a new literary form. It is premature to speak too confidently about it because it has not yet been exemplified in enough works of literature to permit us to regard it as firmly established. If it should become established, the fact would be of great importance since there have been very few changes historically in the dominant patterns of western lit erature. I am speaking of patterns that go deeper than mere mechan isms of verse form or division into acts, or even the larger cate gories of drama and epic. They go deeper indeed than the con ceptions of tragedy and comedy themselves. For these larger patterns are determined by the mores of society. They are the direct reflection of the basic actual patterns of human conduct. We get a clue to their definition from the clarity with which Greek tragedy illustrates the dominance of a particular esthetic form in the sense in which I am using the word. The structure of the Oedipus, for instance, is determined by the Greek belief in eternal law. It was a sin to kill one's father and to have chil dren by one's mother; and such sins must be atoned for. The suspense in the Oedipus comes from the spectators' awaiting the discovery by Oedipus of what they already know. The poignancy of the play lies in the hero's voluntary submission to punishment as soon as he realizes the nature of his sin. Its dramatic power cumulates from the harmony between its psychology and its phil osophy. Its esthetic worth is inextricably involved with its prac tical value as propaganda for conformity to the dominant norms of Greek conduct. Similarly, Prometheus, though he improved man's lot by bringing fire to the earth, has revolted against divine</page><page sequence="2">326_by EDWIN BERRY BURGUM authority, and for his revolt has been sentenced to eternal tor ment. The idea of progress is buried under the idea of static authority. Greek drama rejects the ideal of relativity: the no tion that any competition between two eternal laws might end in a stalemate was abhorrent to the Greek sense of form. It may be true that many dramatic plots reflect the tension in Greek society between a decaying primitive mores and a newer morality. My point is that the plays, in accepting the new morality as right, do not hesitate to reach a definite conclusion. Indeed, the Greek practice of keeping their plots simple, upon which Aristotle in sists, was intended to remove the possibility of confusion and to thrust the particular instance into firm clear subordination to the general rule. We may call the form that results a "closed" struc ture of composition. The guilty exception to what is defined as right practice is punished and disposed of; and eternal law flows on in all its grandeur. The same form is loosely exemplified in the earlier Greek epic. Although war may legitimately interfere, a man should normally be the active head of his family. Ulysses, after a justifiable viola tion of this norm in obedience to the higher exceptional law of service to the race in war, returns to his responsibilities in Ithaca. The difficulties on the way are not of a nature to invoke a tragic conclusion. The more serious difficulty of Penelope's retaining both her own virtue and her husband's rule during his absence is relegated to a single episode and obscured by Ulysses' scatter ing the suitors and the general flush of homecoming. What would for us be the center of attention, the conflict between the two laws, is glossed over by the mechanical application of the closed structure, and plot is lost in mere succession of episodes. The structural difficulties of Greek comedy, which even Aristotle seems to have been unable to cope with, arose from the same source that made tragedy dominant, the rigid conception of drama as a con servative social discipline to maintain respect for eternal law. When this conception was relaxed, as in Aristophanes, when the closed form was laid aside, in the moral holiday of comedy, the Greeks could not achieve a similar compactness of structure. When serious general laws were not violated, the presentation of life</page><page sequence="3">LITERARY FORM 327 tended to become the picture of an amusing flux of events, with out inner logic or apparent direction. When the culture of the classic past was revived during the English Renaissance, these latent structural defects which I have found outside the field of tragedy, in Aristophanes and in the Odyssey, reappear within the realm of tragedy itself. Elizabethan tragedy violates the closed form of the Greek while it melodram atically purports to imitate it. The practice of killing off every body of importance at the end of a tragedy although pedantically justified by the precedent of Seneca gives only the appearance of closed form; gives it quantitatively to conceal the qualitative violation. Hamlet is a prime instance. Virtually everybody is dead, except a minor character who emerges as the new ruler of Denmark. But it would be idle to say that eternal law has been upheld to universal satisfaction. The conflict which seems today most clear and interesting is left a muddle; the conflict between Hamlet's identification with his guilty uncle (his hatred for his father because of his own love for his mother) and his traditional duty to avenge a father's death. But the openly recognized con flicts are scarcely handled any more definitively. While Hamlet vacillates between his philosophical doubt that it is ethical to take human life and this traditional obligation for revenge, chance re solves the issue. In a similar way, while he remains unable to make up his mind whether suicide is justified, life worth while, the immortality of his soul a certainty, chance brings him the death he cannot will either for himself or another. All these con flicts are mechanically resolved in an orgy of killings; so that even though in a few of them justice may appear to have triumphed, it has been by accident; but in most of them we do not know whether justice has been done or not. We have only the psy chological finality of death in place of the philosophical finality of the triumph of justice. This avalanche of deaths has buried the one generalization the era accepted as absolute; the price of dissention within the royal family has been the foreign conquest of one's country. The play leaves the observer with a psychologi cal exhaustion that does not entirely conceal his philosophical confusion. Obviously there are too many conflicts of values here, and however episodically gratifying, they are not resolved in any</page><page sequence="4">328_by EDWIN BERRY BURGUM way that is clear enough to be socially useful. Nor is Hamlet the only play of Shakespeare's exhibiting this confusion of meanings. Richard the Second similarly hesitates between the desirability of removing a particular king and the fear of popularizing such a removal into a general rule. In fact, the exceptions to this am biguity in Shakespeare are those plays in which the recognition of legitimate political authority is unquestioned. These are the plays, like Macbeth, the most "classical" of them all, in which, because Shakespeare is most conservative politically, he can se cure a more swift and coherent plot. But Lear, though it argues the question in the wisdom of Lear's madness, also achieves the closed structure with its thesis, repeated for emphasis in a sub plot, that everybody suffers when a strong legitimate hand fails to control the state, the family, and by inference those business corporations into which the old guilds are being transformed. In the multitude of these conflicts is to be found the brilliance of the Elizabethan drama. But I do not think it has often enough been recognized that they are only reflections of unresolved con flicts in society itself. The superb closed system of medieval life has broken down. While it has lasted, it has reinforced the phil osophical absolute of Greek thought with the fool-proof doctrine of divine inspiration from the Biblical tradition. The notion of tragic conflict itself became an impiety. A society so certain of its authority, so systematic in its view of the universe, could only have made Satan its tragic hero and would have felt it blasphemy to do so. Conflict could no longer be solved by human action, but only through the grace of God. Absorbed in the positive rules and the heavenly hope of the Christian faith, the medieval so ciety felt neither the need nor the desire to emphasize the tragic exception. But now the tragic exception floods in everywhere and nobody can be sure it is not instead a novelty to which old rules, and the old conception of rules, no longer apply. Empiricism is in the air. The old is on the defensive everywhere except in poli tics where absolutism saves itself temporarily by championing the new. Elizabethan society, after the Armada, was a temporary uneasy equilibrium, held together by the personality of the queen, the flush of military victory, the prosperity of the country. But the class antagonisms beneath are denoted by the fact that the</page><page sequence="5">LITERARY FORM 329 monarch, though absolute, had to get permission of the bourgeoisie in order to enter her city of London. Feudal values are in process of being superseded by bourgeois ones. Underneath its specious adherence to classical forms and its real rejection of medieval, Elizabethan tragedy is expressing its interest in exceptions to the rule more than it is celebrating in true classical fashion the rule itself. The form of the drama, then, is actually changing under pres sure of the new attitude and authority of the middle class. But it is more important to note that it never reaches a clarity com parable to the Greek. Under the growing opposition of the mid dle class, neo-classicism, which represented the last puff of feudal inspiration, grabbed for the classic closed structure and strangled it in the dying grasp of dogmatism. Thus, at least, I would de scribe the rise of the doctrine of the three unities in France and the stilted formalism of Racine. In England, where the pressure of the new class was more imperative, even theoretical dogmatism could hardly be achieved by neo-classicism. It defeats itself in the grotesque extravagance of Rymer or is forced against its will into an experimental attitude in the criticism of Dryden. As far as the writing of dramas is concerned, the English neo-classicist had become incapable either of writing tragedies or of enjoying their production. The tragedies of Dryden are the exception that proves the rule. Generally speaking, tragedy in any effective sense of the word, became impossible; and comedy, losing the mechanical form it had inherited from Roman models, became tragi-comedy. Tragi-comedy may be difficult to define as esthetic structure, but its psychological origins are clear. It results from the impact of middle class seriousness upon aristocratic frivolity. Incapable of taking its ideals seriously, the English aristocracy could only satirize itself. It dared not satirize the middle class save through the compromising medium of its own relationship to the squirearchy; and when it sought a little consolation for its impotence in an impulse to ribaldry, it found a Jeremy Collier at the door. In fact the virus of middle class morality was al ready infecting its own thin blood. Congreve might satirize the innocence of virginity, but at the end of Love for Love he melts into adoration of it.</page><page sequence="6">330 by EDWIN BERRY BURGUM The transition continues, and only a new type of confusion emerges. But it would be fairer to look for an example within the ranks of the middle class. Often the difference, putting style aside, is only one of emphasis, as in Defoe where the writer is officially on the side of morality but is tempted to approach it through the detailed delineation of its opposite. Milton, of course, is the proper example. And if one demurs that he transcends the limitations of class, of course, he does in certain respects. Lycidas, for instance, is thoroughly classical. It is not only a closed structure; the closed structure is positively framed for us when the shepherd by his example tells us to quit moping and turn to our own affairs; we have been purged of pity and fear, and should now know enough to go about our business. But I cannot help feeling that this emphasis upon the frame was a re sponse to the contemporary temptation to tragi-comedy, a wilful rejection of its mixture of values by the most conscious discrim ination of them. Where death was concerned, it was easy for Milton to be a purist. But in Paradise Lost, his most mature work, he too reproduces the deficiency of his age, and if we do not recognize that this is so, it is only that we share the deficiency still. In a way we do recognize it whenever we discuss whether Satan or God is the hero. What we fail to see is that this dis cussion is irrelevant. Of course God is the official hero, but Adam is the actual one, and if we talk with admiration of many of Satan's qualities, it is that they are the virtues of Adam. Not the characteristics Adam displays while idling in the voluptuous ness of the Garden, but those we see beginning to show when he pulls himself together after the Fall, proud that the chance has come to show his manhood, to protect his wife, to exercise greater free will than choosing this rather than that banana. Adam is humanly sad to renounce the easy life of the leisure class, but he leaves the Garden of Eden like a man with a job to do and a scarcely concealed impatience to be about it. He has become the bourgeois ideal. And I wonder a little that those critics who seem shocked that Milton portrays so human a Satan with such under standing have not been more shocked that he dared what Dante never ventured, to portray God himself. In Satan an unconscious urge to rewrite the Prometheus legend is barely restrained by</page><page sequence="7">LITERARY FORM 331 conscious deference to the traditional subject. But in the gar rulous conversation of God with his son the Promethean spirit leads the poet into an actual parody of the naive anthropomorph ism of primitive peoples, and he not only pictures God as a man but as virtually the sort of man, aged and retired from business, to which Newton and Deism were about to reduce him. These are the real meanings of Paradise Lost. The loss of Eden was a great opportunity for man, but officially it was a tragedy. Hence the special confusion of its tragi-comedy. Satan has been the paradoxical instrument to release the energies of Adam, and we are at once (though obliquely) plunged into the later Romantic confusions between moral good and evil. When therefore, the middle class values which Paradise Lost represents find they cannot express themselves through the closed form of classical tragedy, they frankly create the new form of tragi-comedy. That is, they are no longer capable of producing tragedies; tragedy henceforth, as a form, degenerates into the tragi-comedy of melodrama; it cannot take itself seriously. But the new type fails to get clarified, fails to develop beyond the innuendoes of Paradise Lost. I think the explanation once more lies within the nature of the social situation itself. For the new society never explicitly denies the existence of eternal laws, but it does more and more (if we leave professional philosophers be hind) take its attention off from them. The theology of Paradise Lost, which is bad enough, deliquesces into Night Thoughts and Pleasures of the Imagination. Men are becoming absorbed in the practice of the new method of Adam which that other Adam Smith is to define so sharply for us as the method of competition. Any significant universal view of things dessicates into a neo classical survival in the eighteenth century or spins the thread bare fabric of a Paley. Burke alone, attempts to stem the tide by submitting the laws of competition to the higher law of social equilibrium, but he was only temporarily successful, since at the same time new theories of progress and evolution were approach ing the problem from another angle. Under such circumstances even tragi-comedy tends to disappear. Esthetic expression tends to lose sight of form altogether, and holds desperately to "the</page><page sequence="8">332 by EDWIN BERRY BURGUM forms" or experiments with new forms, or as in Sterne ridicules the attempt. The individualism of the Romantic movement marks a crisis in these tendencies. But for our purpose here, its importance is that it brings into the open the notion of progress. Now altogether and for the first time we find emerging a literature which dis regards all deference to the static law of the Greeks. Whether the method of competition is an eternal one or no, the attention is now centered on the new conception of history as change in an ever better direction. For the first time we get a frankly "open" literary structure. Contrast the novel of Fielding, in which mar riage closes like death upon Tom Jones, with the novel of Dickens which he can scarcely end he is so conscious of the passage of time and the production of children. The tendency is more strik ing still in the family series of Balzac and Dumas. Shelley's poetry is, however, the best example of open structure, and his Adonais should be contrasted with both Lycidas and Paradise Lost. Unlike Milton, Shelley will not leave his dead friend at peace in heaven. His poet hero has become a Prometheus un bound of ideas provocative of human progress. When he dies, he continues his development and in some obscure but certain way from his eternal abode still influences the hearts of men to their improvement. Shelley discarded his materialism, but he did not discard his ideal of progress; he made it go on in heaven in an almost Hegelian way. For the open form progress is an endless process, in contrast to those examples of the closed form which seem to admit prog ress within limits, without transmutation of species, and hence "closed" and become static once the limit is reached. A medieval, pilgrimage of human life is an example of such a closed form, be cause accumulation of moral worth or worthlessness stops when heaven or hell has been reached. The essential characteristic of the open form is that the entire work is presented as only a seg ment of a continuing universal process. The development that has been going on during its story continues by inference along the general lines that have been set, after the words have actually stopt. It is the opposite to a process of purgation and leaves the reader not tranquil but disturbed or on the edge to act. It</page><page sequence="9">LITERARY FORM 333 tends to remove the conception of tragedy entirely from literary expression in this best of all possible worlds. But we must not press in too detailed a definition. For the new concept remained of shifting content once you got beyond the general idea. The failure to understand its essential meanings, whatever they might be, we posit from the inability of Romantic literature to present dramatic action without falling into melo drama or sentimentality. The new form could not yet express itself through conflict and action, in what the critic would call dramatic structure. Its expression remained subjective, ideational, verbose, mere simple narration. The loose structure of the novel suited it; or the short lyric in which intricacy of meter disguised the lack of essential form. It is more germane to our purpose to examine a later develop ment of this open form. As the flush of Romanticism passed, a literature came into existence in which the idea of progress per sists despite an actual pessimism as far as actual present facts and moods are concerned. Shelley, once more, is the pioneer. The Ode to the West Wind ends with an abrupt turn from pessimism and impotence in the present to blind faith that spring must fol low winter. Zola's Germinal is a later instance from the field of fiction. The bulk of the novel consists of candid pessimistic ob servation. Though written from what we should now call a labor point of view, it shows no ray of hope. A coal strike is put down; the workers return to work at lower wages; they have learned no lesson of organization from the strike; the union leaders are hopelessly theoretical, more in touch with the middle class and their own political ambitions than with the working class; while on the other side, the organization of owners is in effective alli ance with the police powers of the government. No whit of the action of the novel justifies optimism; yet it has a happy ending of blind faith in the future dominance of the working class. Here an obviously closed structure is followed by an open conclusion which has no structural relation to it. Almost the same structure is found much later in Thomas Mann's Magic Mountain. A hope less picture of European decadence, followed by an expression of faith that out of the World War good must come through the automatic functioning of the natural law of the oscillation of the</page><page sequence="10">334_by EDWIN BERRY BURGUM dominance of good and evil. Mann, to be sure, furnishes a per verse connection in that this serious final philosophy has been pre viously expounded with the vacillating irony of doubt by one of his characters. Little more has been accomplished in all these years than that the latent contradiction in Paradise Lost has become glaringly clear. But the contradiction in Milton's work had been in the philosophy itself, not in the action; the open form of its con clusion had an evident relationship to the previous action. Now the contradiction is openly between the action and the philosophy; a now consistently optimistic philosophy is tacked on to consist ently depressing facts. Here is no satisfactory solution of the Miltonian dilemma. The dominant arts of our own period, painting, music, sculp ture, have resolved the contradiction by abandoning the social scene and restoring the closed form in a new guise of purely ab stract geometrical design. According to this conception "good" sculpture anywhere at any time, whether its theme is a madonna or a pigmy African chieftain, affords the same pleasure of bal anced masses, of rhythmic symmetries of line or curve. Fiction has found greater obstacles in the way of escaping social mean ing. But the torturous structures of the subjective novel, of sym bolism in poetry, of the whole cult of unintelligibility, show that our writers are making the desperate attempt. A portion of the literature descriptive of the working class alone has taken an opposite course. It has not sought to escape but to solve the Miltonic dilemma, the dilemma of Shelley and Zola. It succeeded in cutting through it when it found factual evidence for a new relationship between the closed and the open forms which sacrifices neither but brings them both for the first time into a new and an apparently adequate relationship. Thus at long last, it has evolved an intelligible definition of tragi-comedy. A total of pessimistic facts, whether in Sophocles or in Zola, in evitably demands the closed structure; for under such circum stances a strike, such as Zola presented, not only fails, but it fails for a reason similar to that for Oedipus' failure; the cumulation of mistakes becomes proof of the violation of an eternal law con cerning the social position of the working class. The "tragic flaw"</page><page sequence="11">literary form 335 now becomes the inability of the working class to recognize its humble position in the social structure which leads it into the mistake of trying to better itself by resort to the unruly method of the strike. Such a novel might theoretically be written. But it is an important historical fact that none, taking this position with the frankness of a Sophocles, has to my knowledge appeared. Certain novels have been published in which this conclusion would be clear enough if the events had been presented by themselves but is only a neglected inference since they have been overlaid with so much apparent sympathy or hypocritical disguise. The two that I have read happen to be both about the Spanish Civil War, Joseph Peyre's Rehearsal in Orvieto and Ernest Heming way's For Whom the Bell Tolls. They should be read to gain insight into the difficulties that baffle the attainment of the closed style today. But strikes do fail, as any particular venture of man may. If a writer nevertheless demands an optimistic conclusion to his novel which is something more than a detachable postscript at the end, he must throw his conclusion into some sort of valid re lationship to those very same events which are leading to the failure of the strike. In those events must lie the seeds both of the immediate failure and of the presumption of ultimate or later success. By a dialectic relationship amongst the details of the narration, the two opposite truths must be thrown into harmony: the truth that social progress exists as a general rule and the truth that the reality of particular failure indubitably exists also. The first truth is the new truth which science and Romanticism have brought into our consciousness; the second is the candor of classi cal observation disassociated from its particular philosophical ex planation. The first without the second produces the open struc ture of fantasy, unrelated to fact and history, like so much Romantic literature which has been justly criticized. But the classic recognition of the tragic event requires a more profound, a less one-sided analysis than the classic tradition has afforded it. The classic error lay in denuding the event of material, essential to its validity but irrelevant to the tragic conclusion which the dramatist sought to present with the impressiveness of over simplification. A banal platitude of Romanticism itself here helps</page><page sequence="12">336 by EDWIN BERRY BURGUM us out; for every cloud does have its silver lining; the unalloyed misfortune no more exists than the unqualified pleasure, the suc cess without a flaw. Every event, like the human personalities that participate in it, has its fluctuating antagonistic elements that make possible its feeding into either a pattern of success or failure. It feels the tug of other events upon it; these will determine the side of it that comes uppermost immediately; but its other and contradictory aspects continue to exist, continue to await those other events, more congenial to them that may activate it perhaps in an opposite direction. When the novelist's detail is seen in this fashion, his belief in progress demands also belief in the pos sibility of failure, belief in the existence of degenerative elements in society. The closed structure had a comfortable simplicity; a particular bad conflicts with an eternal good. But the Romantic open struct ure was an uncomfortable confusion. It had no method of recon ciling progress and poverty, joy and sorrow or any of the other well known contradictions. Tragi-comedy recognized the con fusion but could not give it order until the emergence of these new novels I am referring to. In them the hero may die, which is certainly a closed structure as far as he is concerned, but the cause may plausibly live on in an open structure ending because the effect of his exertions remains as a_ social force. Or the oppo site may be true; the cause may for the moment be done for, but the hero lives on to revive it. This new form, to be sure, de mands special definition of the hero as only the more successful creation of the same social forces that are at work in society gen erally. He is so well-integrated that he can in varying degrees mould the social forces that have created him; so that his death leaves a process functioning though in a changed fashion. The final crisis in such a case is only the last of a series throughout the book, and each crisis is a redistribution of the forces of men and events which has both its optimistic and its pessimistic sides. Progress under this new conception of conflict in action is no longer a vague concept of mechanical, and therefore unconscious, accumulation of good, but it is a process of human conflict from which any respite is only a temporary equilibrium. Every novel, thus composed, becomes avowedly an episode in the larger move</page><page sequence="13">literary form 337 ment of history, and even though exclusively about the present, is more truly an historical novel than the thousands so named which have understood the past as only a different back-drop to the same old story of human nature. This new form, while rec ognizing as clearly as any Greek that tragedy exists, can at one and the same time bring a form the Greeks could never attain to the definition of comedy by throwing it frankly into this dialectic relationship to the tragic fact. Since the handling of detail is vital to the success of this new conception and a handling of detail opposite to that of "the slice of life" school, any synopsis of a novel that illustrates it is bound to sound unfairly mechanical, like a glib summary of a living sit uation. But I take Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath to be a superb instance of this new method. The main story of the Joads gives the following graph. Traditional American optimism until the family reaches California; then a plunge into pessimism, relieved by the experience of the possibility of a better life in the govern ment camp; but after leaving it, a drifting into a confusion of vague hope and cruel experience. Meanwhile another graph is needed for Casey and Tom Joad. The preacher is pessimistic at the start when the family is cheerful; he becomes the confident leader of the farm hands in California when the Joads have lost hope. Though he is killed and Tom is forced to flee because he has killed a man in Casey's defense, Tom has been influenced by Casey's example and the experience of the government camp. In his farewell conversation with his mother, he sets the tone, phil osophically and psychologically, that hovers over the action of the rest of the book. The consequence is that the hope of the Joads at the end of the book is inarticulate and unfocused rather than vague; for Tom has aroused the conviction, in startling con trast to the desperation of their present circumstances, that he is somewhere still learning, and that he or, if he is killed, one of the men he has trained, the whole mass of those who have similarly learned, of those who now understand the valid meaning of demo cracy, will ultimately come to the rescue. I believe that this novel is the most subtle and adequate illustration of this new form of successful tragi-comedy. We are not here interested in the nature of the social viewpoint 4</page><page sequence="14">338 by EDWIN BERRY BURGUM of these novels beyond the factual statement that the new form appears congenial only to writers sympathetic to democracy and the common man. Our point is, rather, that we have at length seen emerge in modern times that extremely rare phenomenon, a new esthetic form, which appears to have resolved a confusion in the definition of tragi-comedy that has existed since the Renais sance.</page></plain_text>
