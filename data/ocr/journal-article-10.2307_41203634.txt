<plain_text><page sequence="1">Galileo: a New Science and a New Spirit ERNST CASSIRER hundred years ago last January Galileo Galilei THREE died - a date of supreme significance not only in the history of physics as a special science but also in the history of human civilization. Had Galileo died as a child the evolution of modern thought would have been retarded for decades and would almost certainly have differed in many fundamental aspects. He was one of those great and rare geniuses whose work is not restricted to any special field of investigation. We not only may, we must, think of his work from a general philosophical point of view and in the perspective of the history of modern philosophy. For even in the field of philosophy Galileo's thought proved revolutionary. In his last work, Discorsi e Dimostrazioni matematiche interno due nuove Scienze (Con- versations and Mathematical Demonstations), Galilei not only set forth new and fundamental physical facts; he introduced and firmly established a new general method of scientific thought, a method of empirical observation and mathematical deduction. To understand this method and to interpret it in its true sense became one of the principal tasks of modern phi- losophy. Thenceforth no philosophical school, no individual thinker, could avoid the problems first posed clearly by Galilei. The empirical and the rationalistic schools of modern phi- losophy are likewise under the influence and, so to speak, under the spell of Galilei's work. We can trace his thought in the works of Spinoza and Leibniz, of Gassendi and Hobbes. And when, in his Critique of Pure Reason^ Kant tried to appraise Based on a lecture delivered at Cornell University, April 1942. 5</page><page sequence="2">The American Scholar the consequences of empiricism and rationalism he was obliged to go back to the source of this development. In the Preface to the second edition of the Critique he says: When Galilei let balls of a particular weight, which he had determined himself, roll down an inclined plane ... a new light flashed on all students of nature. They comprehended that reason has insight into that only which she herself produces on her own plan, and that she must move forward with the principles of her judgments, according to fixed law, and compel nature to answer her questions. . . . Reason holding in one hand its principles . . . and in the other hand the experi- ment, which it has devised according to those principles, must approach nature in order to be taught by it: but not in the character of a pupil who agrees to everything the master likes but as an appointed judge who compels the witnesses to answer the questions which he himself pro- poses. . . . Thus only has thel study of nature entered on the secure method of a science, after having for many centuries done nothing but grope in the dark.2 I wish here to emphasize the methodological purport of Galileo's scientific work. Galileo's fame as a scientist depends on his discovery and his experimental proof of the fundamental laws of dynamics and on his defense of the Copernican system. His trial and condemnation linked his name once and for all time with the history of that system. But this is not the question that most strikes us if nowadays we read and study Galileo's work, for in the three hundred years since his death our scientific and philosophical interest has shifted. Many of the arguments whereby Galilei endeavored to support the Copernican theory have become obsolete. The decisive element in Galileo's work was not the defense of a special physical or astronomical doctrine (however important this doctrine may be) but the defense of a new concept, of a new systematic ideal of truth. In a famous letter written in the year 1 6 1 3 to one of his pupils, Benedetto Castelli, at that time a professor of mathe- matics in the University of Pisa, Galilei formulated the new ideal with admirable brevity and clarity. 2Emmanuel Kant, Critique of Pure Reason, Preface to 2d Edition. Translated by F. Max MÃ¼ller. London, Macmillan and Co., 1881, Vol. I, p. 368. 6</page><page sequence="3">Galileo: a New Science and a New Spirit The letter was to play an important role in Galileo's trial, for it became one of the principal grounds of his condemnation. But we find in it not only the assumption of a special astronom- ical hypothesis. The letter is much more; it is a new philosophy of science, a new appreciation of the task and the value of scientific thought. In this respect the letter is a radical revalua- tion of all values. There is no human or divine authority, de- clared Galilei, that may be placed above the authority of experi- ment and mathematical deduction. In the field of physics the principle of verbal inspiration - a principle that had thereto- fore been the guiding maxim of theology and consequently of medieval science - is to be rejected utterly. If ever there should arise an insoluble contradiction between something ascertained by empirical observation and something taught by the Holy Scripture there can be no doubt as to the side on which the scale of the balance of truth must decline. There is a double revelation of God, said Galilei - the one contained in His word, the other contained in His work, the one to be found in the Bible and the other to be found in nature and its general laws. But in case of doubt the latter revelation must always prevail over the former. For words are destined for human purposes. They are the most important, nay the unique, means of all communcation between men. But if there is any communication between God and men it cannot be based upon so uncertain a ground as words. Words are ambiguous by their very nature and essence. To be understood they must be interpreted - and this interpretation must always remain doubtful and insecure. But as soon as we turn to the second source of divine revelation, to God's revelation in nature, this uncertainty ceases. Out of the mutual support of observable facts and demonstrable mathe- matical propositions there arises an image of reality that possesses a unique and necessary truth. Why should we therefore, con- cluded Galileo, in striving to know the universe and its parts begin with the word of God instead of with His work - or is perhaps the work less noble and excellent than the word? What- ever knowledge may be given us in the form of true experience 7</page><page sequence="4">The American Scholar or whatever may be taught by conclusive demonstrations can never be questioned by any argument taken from Biblical texts, for not every word of the Scripture is governed by such rigid laws as every effect in nature. But this conception of the relation between God and nature immediately led to a new result, and one that from the point of view of medieval thought must have been not merely astonishing but scandalous. If mathematics is the bridge be- tween human and Divine thought it follows that there can be no insurmountable gulf between these two forms of thought, no radical difference between our own finite mind and the Divine intellect. Galilei drew this inference in a famous passage in his Dialogues. If we compare God and man, he says, with regard to the extent of their knowledge it is clear that human science is to be set at naught. For even if man knew many thousands of true propositions their sum would be as nothing when com- pared with the infinity of possible knowledge. But if we under- stand knowledge in a qualitative or, as Galilei said, in an intensive sense, if instead of its extent we take into account its intrinsic worth and its logical perfection, the problem suddenly changes. We then find that our human intellect conceives some truths so perfectly that it can gain such absolute evidence of them as exists in nature. Of this sort are all mathematical truths - the verities of arithmetic and geometry. Obviously, pointed out Galilei, the Divine intellect knows and conceives an infinitely greater number of mathematical truths than we do; for it knows and comprehends them in their totality. But with regard to objective certainty, the few verities known by the human mind are known as perfectly by man as they are by God. The verities of mathematics are necessary and eternal truths - and we cannot imagine any degree of perfection ca- pable of surpassing this mathematical evidence. This passage, from our modern point of view harmless and innocent, gave the greatest offense to Galileo's ecclesiastical judges. And if the passage is measured by the traditional 8</page><page sequence="5">Galileo: a New Science and a New Spirit standards of the Church his judges were undoubtedly right, for implicitly it denies one of the keystones of the edifice of medieval thought. In the medieval system there was always an insurmountable boundary separating two different realms of truth. There was an immanent and a transcendent truth, a human and a Divine truth, a truth of reason and a truth of revelation. But Galilei ventured in his Dialogues to deny and to demolish this distinction. As soon as we have reached the real truth, the truth of mathematics, he asserted, this artificial fence breaks down. Mathematics is indivisible. There is no immanent or transcendent, no human or Divine, mathematics. And the same holds good in the field of natural science. Urban VIII, the Pope under whose pontificate Galilei was accused and condemned, had been while he was a cardinal one of Galilei's protectors. To a certain extent he had even acknowledged the Copernican theory to be an admissible astronomical hypothesis. But in a personal conversation with Galilei he had objected that even if all observations and experiments and all mathematical reasoning supported Copernicus' theory, it would not follow that Galilei's doctrine must be true. For the omnipotence of God is not contingent on the rules and principles of human reason. God was, therefore, perfectly free to create the world according to laws entirely divergent from those which human science can discover and human reason comprehend. But Galilei could not accept this view. He knew and acknowledged no possible contradiction between the will of God on the one hand and the rules of logic, the axioms of mathematics, the facts of physics on the other. If these rules, these axioms, these facts are to be regarded as an immediate manifestation of God Him- self we cannot restrict their objective truth. Where reason speaks, there speaks God - and He cannot contradict Himself. By this general philosophical and scientific conviction Galilei had cut himself off from every possible retreat in his conflict with the Church. Conflicts between reason and faith, between free and authoritative thought had continually arisen through- out the Middle Ages and during the early Renaissance the 9</page><page sequence="6">The American Scholar latent crisis became more and more manifest. But in most of these cases there had always been an ultimate personal refuge. Nearly all who had doubted or contested a fundamental and dogmatic proposition concluded with the protestation that they by no means intended to call the revealed truth into question. Their doubts could prove only one thing: that there is a double truth, one for God and one for men, one accessible to our reason and one far above and beyond it. In the philosophical schools of Italy the doctrine of a double truth had been carefully elaborated and developed into a special technique of thought. But this compromise was not open to Galilei, for he insisted with the greatest vigor that if there is any truth this truth must be one and indivisible. The truth is necessity; and necessity admits of no degrees. But Galilei had still another dualism to overcome before he could found a science of nature. Plato had based his philosophy upon the presupposition that we cannot speak of a science of nature in the same sense as we can of a science of mathematics. For him mathematics was directed to the ideal world, the world of eternal and unchanging things; whereas physics, confined within the limits of natural phenomena, which have no real being, could never discover the permanent. It was most difficult for Galilei to combat the authority of Plato. He fervently admired Plato. In many respects he felt himself a true disciple of the Greek philosopher and often quoted characteristic and important passages from the Platonic dialogues. But he was convinced that in his own work, in the new science of dynamics, he had removed the barrier Plato had erected between mathe- matical and natural science; for this new science proved nature itself a realm of necessity rather than of chance. Nature is governed by universal and inviolable laws. Nature, affirmed Galileo, is no mystery to the human mind. It is an open book accessible and legible to everyone. But to read this book we must first of all know the letters in which it is written. And it is written not in ordinary sense perceptions but in mathe- matical symbols: in triangles, circles and other geometrical io</page><page sequence="7">Galileo: a New Science and a New Spirit figures. If we so understand nature then geometrical and physi- cal knowledge become equivalent in their logical value. Motion ceased to be a mere changing and flowing phenomenon; for Galilei it became an idea, a pure form belonging just as surely to a realm of eternal truth as do our ideas of number or of geo- metrical space. The most striking characteristic of Galilei's approach was his great simplicity of method. The words "Simplex sigillum veri," simplicity is the seal of truth, are applicable to his first questions and experiments. He began with the investigation of a single and obvious phenomenon - the fall of heavy bodies - something that had been observed innumerable times. But the conclusions he drew from this simple phenomenon gradually led him to an all-embracing and comprehensive view of the physical world that changed man's entire concept of nature. In his MÃ©canique Analytique Lagrange, a great physicist of the 1 8 th century who rounded out and completed the work of Galilei, commented: For the discovery of the satellites of Jupiter, of the phases of Venus, of the sunspots and so on, nothing but telescopes and assiduity were required. But it called for an extraordinary genius to detect the laws of nature in such phenomena as, in all times, had been evident, but the explanation of which had always escaped philosophical thought. The really revolutionary element in Galilei's work con- sisted not only of the way in which he answered the question but of the way in which he put the question. And to achieve the new approach he had to free himself from a philosophical and scientific tradition that had for centuries determined man's concept of the shape of the cosmic system. At first sight Aristotle's physics seems to be in full agreement with the modern view of the universe. Aristotle defined a physical or natural object as something having within itself a principle of motion and rest in respect of place, size or quality. Motion is therefore just as certainly the fundamental fact in Aristotle's physics as it is the focus of Galilei's thought and of II</page><page sequence="8">The American Scholar his physical theories. But there is a decisive difference in the "reasons" of motion as understood by Galilei and by Aristotle and his medieval followers. According to Aristotle we must seek these reasons in the essence and nature of things, in their "substantial forms." Every particular substance has a motion of its own corresponding to its peculiar nature, to its ontological character. Fire, water, air, earth are endowed with special inner tendencies and these tendencies determine the form of their motion: fire always strives upward to the heavens, earth always strives downward to the center of the universe. And beyond the sphere of the elementary movements - of the move- ments of water and air, of fire and earth - there is still another sphere composed of quite a different substance and therefore irreducible to the same general rules. Whereas all earthly elements move in straight lines - a movement that after a cer- tain time must necessarily come to a standstill - the motion of celestial bodies is eternal because their substance is eternal and indestructible. The substance of the heavens is incorruptible whereas the substance of our elements, of the world below the moon, is liable to change and decay. The same view prevailed in all the great systems of medieval thought insofar as they dealt with the fundamental problems of natural philosophy. Thomas Aquinas expressly declared that we must not think of the substance of the celestial spheres as anything analogous to the stuff of our earthly bodies. Between earthly and heavenly matter there is a verbal rather than a real community. Galilei's theory of dynamics destroyed this con- cept of a radical heterogeneity of matter - in the same sense in which his philosophy destroyed the assumption of a radical heterogeneity of truth. From his observations of falling bodies Galilei had learned that all heavy bodies fall in accordance with identical laws and with equal velocities, regardless of their mass or their chemical composition. Nature, concluded Galilei, is uniform; it always acts in the same way. For Galilei the homogeneity of matter was a simple corollary of his belief in the universality of the laws of nature. 12</page><page sequence="9">Galileo: a New Science and a New Spirit But to reach this goal, to conceive of nature as a system governed by universal and inviolable laws, modern thought had to take another step. Man had to renounce his teleological interpretation of nature; he had to view categories of ends and means as merely human categories restricted to a special and limited field and losing their usefulness and validity as soon as men strive for a universal explanation of cosmic phenomena. Here we grasp the real significance of Galilei's defense of the Copernican system. He could not desist j nor could he com- promise without sacrificing the unity and the fundamental character of his thought. He adopted the Copernican system not merely as an astronomical hypothesis but as an emancipa- tion from the narrow anthropocentrism and anthropomorphism that had theretofore impeded all investigation of natural phe- nomena. This concept of finality - that the processes of nature are directed toward an end or shaped by a purpose - pervaded both Aristotelian and medieval physics and metaphysics. Finality is both the reason for being of all things and the reason for all of our knowledge. From the human point of view this concept, fulfilling not only our intellectual but also our ethical and aesthetic demands, was natural and satisfactory. But modern science had to relinquish the principle of finality for an entirely new system of categories. Instead of being based on the concept of means and ends, modern science depends on the concept of space and time, number, quantity and measure. It was a long time, however, before Aristotelian teleology was superseded by the modern mathematical view. In the science and philosophy of the Renaissance we can follow, step by step, the slow development from the one to the other. Kepler went back to the Pythagorean conception of the universe. He strove to explain nature on the basis of number and harmony: God, he reiterated, is always counting and reckoning. Despite this insistence Kepler had no wish to sacrifice the Aristotelian scheme of thought. Neither the three laws formulated by Kepler nor the new cosmology inherent in the work of Coperni- cus, however important and decisive they both proved to be for 13</page><page sequence="10">The American Scholar the future development of scientific thought, were in them- selves strong enough to break the power of the Aristotelian sys- tem of physics. Even while rejecting particular ideas and particular doctrines of Aristotelian physics, Copernicus and Kepler continued to argue and reason within the framework of his metaphysics and ontology. To convince men of the truth of the heliocentric system Copernicus reasoned teleologically. He argued that it is most natural to ascribe the noblest place, the place in the center of the world, to the noblest celestial body, the sun. And in Kepler's Harmonia Mundi we find, over and over again, the same mode of thinking. In Kepler's mind mathematical thought and aesthetic speculation interpene- trated each otherj they were inseparable. Galilei was the first to make such a separation. He did not deny that metaphysical or teleological explanations of the phenomena of nature are possible. But he conceived his own task, the task of natural philosophy, as having a different function. Alluding to some general cosmological speculations from Kepler's Mysterium Ð¡ osmographicum Galilei remarked: But profound considerations of this kind belong to a higher science than ours. We must be satisfied to belong to that class of less worthy work- men who procure from the quarry the marble out of which later the gifted sculptor produces those masterpieces which lay hidden in this rough and shapeless exterior.8 We cannot, therefore, attain full insight into the nature and value of Galileo's science if we content ourselves with charac- terizing it according to the standards we customarily use in describing a philosophical system. It is commonly thought that in analyzing modern philosophy one should draw a clear line of demarcation between the rationalistic and the empiricist theory of knowledge. But if we follow this procedure the place we should assign to the thought and work of Galileo is by no means obvious. Galileo was not merely an empiricist; it may be claimed that he and not Bacon was the true founder of 8Galilei, Conversations and Mathematical Demonstrations on Two New Branches of Science. English translation by Henry Crew and Alfonso de Salvio. New York, Macmillan and Co., 1914, p. 193. H</page><page sequence="11">Galileo: a New Science and a New Spirit modern philosophical empiricism. On the other hand there has been no rationalistic thinker from the time of Leibniz on who has not admired Galileo and cited his method. The logical structure of Galileo's natural philosophy is not to be described by the categories of empiricism or rationalism taken in their traditional sense. For his natural philosophy does not separate reason and experience} on the contrary it sets up between them an entirely new relationship. A law of nature must be based on facts; it must contain no element incapable of verification, of experimental proof. But the facts themselves are not derived from sensory experience alone. The brute facts, before they can become the basis for what we call a law of nature, must be analyzed and brought into a logical order. In Galilei's scientific work we find the first and in a sense the classic examples of this type of mental analysis. Although grounded in experience it does not identify scientific experience with what is immediately perceived through sensory perception or acci- dental, unmethodical observation. All inquiry into the laws of nature is, Galileo was convinced, bound to a twofold pro- cedure - to a method of analysis and synthesis or, to use Galileo's own terms, to a method of resolution and a method of com- position. Scientific thought must dissolve the complex phe- nomena of nature in order to reconstruct them out of their elements; it must differentiate them in order to integrate them. Galileo was not yet in possession of those technical concepts and methods introduced by modern mathematical thought, by Newton's "theory of fluxions" and the differential calculus of Leibniz. But so towering was his mathematical genius that he succeeded in applying modern methods before they had found explicit expression or proof. By the application of the method of analysis and synthesis, of differentiation and integration, he arrived at his principal discoveries in the field of dynamics, his formulation of the law of inertia, his theories about the composi- tion of movements and of forces, his deduction of the laws of falling bodies and of the parabola as the curve of projection. The law of inertia is a far cry from being the immediate descrip- 15</page><page sequence="12">The American Scholar tion of a phenomenon derived from sense-experience. It seems, in fact, to contradict all the data of sense perception, for we have never observed a body actually moving independent of the influence of any outside force. But our scientific thought and our scientific imagination may very well, and must, assume and presuppose a state that strictly speaking is outside our observa- tion. In his Farbenlehre Goethe drew a parallel between Bacon and Galileo. He declared that Bacon was in no sense the true founder of modern empiricism, for his method was much more a method of disintegration than of unification. In contrast to Bacon with his haphazard accumulation of positive and negative instances, Galileo introduced a new type of induction, a method of simplification rather than of expansion and dispersion. In most of Galileo's fundamental experiments it is not so much the bulk of empirical evidence as it is his interpretation thereof that is of primary importance. Goethe goes on to say : Through Bacon's method of dispersion natural science seemed to be scattered forever. But through Galileo it became at once united and concentrated. Galileo proved in his early youth that for a true genius one case may stand for a thousand cases, inasmuch as he developed the theory of the pendulum and of the fall of bodies from the observation of a swinging lamp in a cathedral.4 Looking back at the great discoveries of Galilei we realize that throughout the history of science there has perhaps been no other instance of so great a goal attained by means so slight and inadequate. Galilei had no physical laboratory and no technical apparatus in our modern sense. Most of his instruments he invented and constructed himself. He built his hydrostatic balance, his telescope. He had no chronometer, no instrument for measuring time. When observing the swinging lamp in the cathedral of Pisa he counted his pulse to measure the time. Nor did he possess our conceptual tools. He worked without the infinitesimal calculus that in the hands of his successors, Newton and Lagrange, was one of the most powerful of intellec- 4Goethe, Zur Farbenlehre, Historischer Teil, Naturwissenschaftliche Schriften (Weimar Edition, Part II), Vol. 3, p. 246. 16</page><page sequence="13">Galileo: a New Science and a New Spirit tuai instruments. By the power, the clarity, the precision, of his analytical genius he became the founder of what we today call theoretical physics. Galilei was not a systematic philosopher in the sense we usually associate with this term. Yet although he did not, like Descartes, start with a general principle in order to deduce from this principle all the phenomena of the physical and spiritual universe, his various ideas were linked one with another in an admirably consistent whole. The concept of the unity of truth involves the concept of the unity of nature. Nature was for Galileo a system governed by inviolable laws. Galilei was not the first to conceive this idea. We find the same conception, more than a hundred years earlier, in tfye manuscripts of Leonardo da Vinci. "Necessity/' wrote Leonardo, "is the master and tutor of nature} it is the subject-matter as well as the discoverer of nature; it is its bridle and its eternal ruler." But Galileo proved what Leonardo had felt as a great artist and as a great scientific genius. It was in Galileo that all the basic ideas and ideals of the Renaissance reached their full maturity. Galileo should not be thought of as merely a great thinker and a great scientist. The manifestations of his genius were not limited to his discovery of natural phenomena, his formulation of scientific laws or his concept of the nature of the physical world. These are not his only and perhaps they are not his principal merit. Kant, at the end of his Critique of Practical Reason, wrote : Two things fill the mind with ever-new and increasing admiration and awe, the of tener and the more steadily we reflect on them: the starry heavens above and the moral law within. I have not to search for them and conjecture them as though they were veiled in darkness or were in the transcendent region beyond my horizon: I see them before me and connect them directly with the consciousness of my existence. The former begins from the place I occupy in the external world of sense and enlarges my connection therein to an unbounded extent with worlds upon worlds and systems of systems and moreover into limitless times *7</page><page sequence="14">The American Scholar of their periodic motion, its beginning and continuance. The second begins from my invisible self, my personality, and exhibits me in a world which has true infinity, but which is traceable only by the under- standing. . . .-It infinitely elevates my worth as an intelligence by my personality, in which the moral law reveals to me a life independent on animality and even on the whole sensible world.6 In both respects Galilei was a pioneer of modern thought and modern consciousness. He was great not only in his intellectual genius but in his personality. And he was never greater than in the last years of his life, after his trial and his condemnation. There is an old legend to the effect that after he had abjured the heresy of the Copernican system Galileo added in a low voice the words "Eppur si muove" nevertheless it moves. These words were not spoken and could not have been spoken. Galilei could not defy the authorities of the Church who were the masters of his destiny. But as a prisoner of the Inquisition, and in the greatest personal misery, he continued and completed his principal work, the Conversations and Mathematical Demonstrations on Two New Branches of Science - -a work that will always remain the classic of modern science. When he wrote it Galileo was more than seventy years old. He lived in utter seclusion, without friends, shut off from intercourse with other scientists, deprived of all means of scientific research and even of the ordinary comforts of life. He was suffering from several ailments and was without a physician's care. In carrying on his work under such circumstances Galileo became a great discoverer not only in the field of physical science but equally in the moral world. Galileo realized that his work was not an end but a mere beginning and he foresaw its potentialities for the future. In his Conversations and Mathematical Demonstrations on Two New Branches of Science he wrote: My purpose is to set forth a very new science dealing with a very ancient subject. There is, in nature, perhaps nothing older than motion, Immanuel Kant, Critique of Practical Reason. Translated by Thomas Kingsmill Abbott. Sixth Edition, revised.

And what I consider more important, there have been opened up to this vast and most excellent science, of which my work is only the beginning, ways and means by which other minds more acute than mine will explore its remote corners.6 I find in one of the works of the great medieval philosopher, Bonaventura, a thinker of the 1 3 th century, a passage reasoning that there must always be a gulf between a conviction based on religious grounds and a conviction based upon mere scientific or rational arguments. The firmness and security derived from faith and revelation are always superior to a judgment having no other support than logic or empiricism. As confirmation of this thesis Bonaventura pointed out that there had never been a man who had died for the sake of a speculative truth. A geometer who would choose to die for a mathematical truth would be regarded as a fool whereas every faithful and pious man is ready to die for any article of his faith. These are charac- teristic words, strikingly illuminating the difference between medieval and modern thought - the thought represented by Galileo. In Galileo there appeared not only a new science but a new spirit - the ethics of science. "To believe your own thought/' wrote Emerson in his essay, "Self Reliance," "to believe that what is true for you is true for all men - that is genius. Speak your latent conviction, and it shall be the uni- versal sense; for the inmost in due time becomes the outmost." These words we may apply to Galilei. He did not die the death of a martyr. But under the most tragic conditions he remained true to his great scientific task - he spoke his conviction and this conviction became the universal sense. *O}&gt; cit. 19</page></plain_text>
