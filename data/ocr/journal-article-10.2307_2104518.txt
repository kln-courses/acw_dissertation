<plain_text><page sequence="1">EXPRESSION AND METAPHOR The aim of this study is to examine metaphorical expression from the point of view of an intentional theory of consciousness and to suggest that the necessity of speaking (and thinking) in metaphors is not an accidental weakness of human thought but an existential necessity that pervades all the "sub-universes" of meaning. By an analysis of some of the fundamental metaphors sedimented in (philosophical) language I shall attempt to "situate" the problem of metaphorical expression with respect to experience and to suggest some elements of a general phenomenological theory of metaphor. By way of introduction it is necessary to recall very briefly three guiding notions from the phenomenology of language concerning (1) the pheno- menon of expression, (2) the appresentational structure of language, and (3) the phenomenological definition of meaning. 1. The Phenomenon of Expression. From the point of view of phenomenological analysis, language appears as one aspect of a total, contextual, human activity of "expressing" which cannot be studied in isolation from man's existential insertion in his life- world. If man as a unitary whole is intentional of the world, it is impos- sible to isolate the study of language from the study of man as, a world- intending organism, a dynamic experiencee" who structures his expe- rience by expressing its meaning. According to phenomenology the relation, of man to the world is not static and juxtapositional but dynamic and dialectical. An intentional consciousness is a consciousness strictly corre- lative to its life-world and can be defined and analyzed only in terms of this "ecological" correlativity. Secondly, the phenomenological view of man is nondualistic. Any theory which would analyze human reality into "pure" disembodied con- sciousness on the one hand and a body as its corporeal "instrument" on the other is excluded. Any division of subject and object which would make of lived-corporeality just another "object" of consciousness is like- wise excluded. Human reality as a unitary whole is intentional of the world. 538</page><page sequence="2">EXPRESSION AND METAPHOR 539 Another way of saying the same thing is to say that man is essentially expressive. Man is expressive even before he speaks: in his corporeal attitudes, in behavior, in gestures, in rhythmic movements and tonal utterances, in the creation of artifacts, works of art, and social institutions of all kinds. Man is expressive by his very existence; as Merleau-Ponty observes, for instance, a man's face is condemned to express something even in sleep, even in death. Speech is but one form, doubtless a late and derived form, of expression, and persons who have lost the ability to speak have not for all that lost the ability to express themselves!. The schizophrenic all rolled up in a ball with his face in his hands and unable to utter a sound is still "speaking" in the only way he can. In fact he shouts. Or, to take another example, most friendships are inarticulate. Authentic kindness and sympathy for another are seldom "spoken about"; they are simply done and accepted on a level of sub-understood, implicit, mutual comprehension which is the more expressive the less is "said" about it. No man can rely on language alone to say what he means. Expression is thus a more basic and a much wider category of lived experience than linguistic communication. Expression precedes and per- vades all efforts at communication with others, and communication itself greatly exceeds the area of linguistically expressed meanings, feelings, desires, purposes, judgments, etc. The man who: attempts to say all that he knows or all that he feels is condemned to failure. Logicians like to tell us that there are meanings ("propositions") which are the same for all men and which can be communicated by various empirical linguistic expressions, uttered in various places and at different moments of history. This is partially true and in the extremely simplified and abstract language of mathematics and formal logic -it is possible to express such meanings and to communicate them in a rather adequate manner. However, when one says communication, one enters the world of the intersubjective con- stitution of meaning and it is necessary to suppose that even in the com- munication of mathematical concepts or logical "truths" there lies beneath the threshold of what is, strictly speaking, communicated differences of meaning both for the "communicator" and for the "receiver" that are remarkable. In the highly formalized and abstract form of communication with which formal logicians are content, such differences of meaning are "negligible," but in other forms of communication they become less and less negligible as we proceed from the derived and abstract schemata of mathematics to the lived experience which is their source. For men speak and think and act before they can reflexively analyze and systematize what they have said and thought and done. Our insertion in the world of lived experience precedes any thought about experience. It is possible to ascend to fully communicable meanings which will be the same for all only by</page><page sequence="3">540 PHILOSOPHY AN PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH leaving behind, by abstracting from, every element of concrete, particular individuality that makes a given "expression" expressive.' 2. The Appresentational Structure of Language. It is because man is involved in the world and interested in the world in the company of other men that he speaks. Uttered sounds become instruments for conveying meaning. The-essentially referential character of gestures, words, signs and symbols is frequently indicated by saying that words and signs are arbitrary conventions, but we must reject the "rationalism" inherent -in this statement.. Men did not (and do not) sit down and reflexively excogitate. meanings and then agree on conventions for expressing them - any more than they founded civilized society on an explicit "social contract" as the old rationalistic social theory put it. Thought and -meaning are fully incarnate in language; the thematization of meaning does not precede language but rather language makes such thematization possible.. "For the speaking -subject, expression is a coming to awareness; man does not express himself only to others; he expresses himself in order to discover what he means himself." 2 The rationalistic separation of thought from. expression is based on the presupposition that thought can exist of itself before its bodily, fleshly expression. in gestures, signs and language. But if gestural and verbal expression is a "locali- zation" and a "temporalization" - an incarnation - of meaning, the possi- bility of its corporeal expression in words is an essential condition of the constitution of meaning.3 According to Husserl all forms of symbolic expression (in the widest sense) are marked by their appresentational structure. Here we are con- cerned only with language, though it must be borne in mind that much of what is said concerning language also applies to other forms of expres- sion. The appresentational structure of language involves what in non- phenomenological philosophy are usually called dimensions of reference. It will be convenient to. discuss appresentation in these terms here though it must be mentioned that the phenomenological notion of appresentation 1 See Joe K. Adams, "Expressive Aspects of Scientific Language," On Expressive Language, ed. Heinz Werner, Clark University Press, 1955, pp. 47-52. Adams concludes that "no strict line can be drawn between expressive language and scientific language" (p. 52). 2 Cf. Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Signes, Paris, 1960, p. 113. The whole of this study is indebted to Merleau-Ponty's work on the phenomenology of language. 3 Since phenomenological analysis is not "logical" analysis it deals with "world- phenomena," with words (not "terms"), expressions (not "propositions"), metaphors (not "analogies") etc.</page><page sequence="4">EXPRESSION AND METAPHOR 541 is both richer than the simple notion of reference and more involved than this abbreviated account would suggest at first glance.4 In a general way we can distinguish four levels of appresentational reference in language, all of which are involved in viewing words as the bearers of meaning: (1) First of all, as referring to the meaning-structure they primarily designate, words have two primitive and interrelated functions: (a) to designate or to point to experienced things, happenings, events, processes ("objects" in the widest sense), and (b) to signify or- carry meanings. In their designating or pointing function words enable the speaker to enlarge his life-space and life-time indefinitely. By means of words man can extend his perceptual field, he can manipulate (verbally) things not actually given in perception (though they may have been given previously and may be given again in the future). By means of words man can "live" in the past or the future, in short, by means of words man can manipulate "the absent." It is by the use of language that man takes his distance from the world of lived existence, distinguishes. elements in the chaotic flux of experience and thus experiences himself as transcending the objects of his experience. Words have a gestural function and some words can be simply replaced by facial or deictic gestures, but over and above this function and concomitantly with it words enable us to organize experience and to communicate our version of it to others. (2) Secondly, language is intrinsically referential in that it bears an intrinsic reference to its source, the intentional act of consciousness which is its correlate, man as expressive. Words are "historical" not only in the sense that each word has its own history, its own diachronic development in the linguistic evolution of a given culture. There was a time for each expression when it simply was not. Heidegger has said that it is the function of the thinker and the poet to "name" new things, new aspects of experience, and thus to bring what was "unknown" and as yet hidden or lost in the chaotic flux of experience out into the open, into the realm of the "known" - into the public domain. Experiences which were there before they were -"named," were as yet outside the realm of the- "known" because they were not yet distinguished, they could not be used, they had no distinctive consistency, they had not yet become cultural objects about which men could think and discourse. Just which regions of experience will be differentiated and disclosed by the linguistic process of naming them depends on many human and cultural factors, among which that of 4 The following discussion of appresentation is incomplete and non-technical; it also enlarges Husserl's original notion in significant ways. For Husserl's definition of appresentation cf. Logische Untersuchungen, VI, sections 14-15, 26, Ideen I, 43 (Gibson tr., pp. 135 ff.) and Cartesian Meditations, V, sections 49-54.</page><page sequence="5">542 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH common "interest" and "attention" is perhaps the most central. Some regions of experience are more differentiated in some languages than in others. The Eskimos have several words for snow where we have only one, the Bakairi Indians of Brazil have many names for parrots where we have only one; the Japanese have forty names for different kinds of rice but only one for what we call meat, the Arabs have several hundred words for camels where we have only a few, the illiterate peasant has an extremely rich vocabulary for animals and husbandry of which the literate city-dweller has never heard. But, once we are instructed as to what dis- tinguishes these various types of things from one another, we also can learn to make distinctions in our experience by attending to differences of meaning which are normally below the level of our own cultural threshold. By attending to a given region of experience we can lower the differential thresholds already sedimented in our language almost inde- finitely and make what was implicit in our experience more and more explicit. This is one of the principal functions of linguistic expression and it clearly shows the referential character of language, not only as directed towards experienced things but also towards our experience itself. (3) Thirdly, language as a means of intersubjective communication bears an intrinsic reference to the expressive-communicative context which consists both of the "speaker" and the "others" to whom the expression is directed and to whom it is communicative. When an experience is "named" and when its name is communicated to others, a human social group is enabled to carry it in its collective consciousness, to return to it, to possess it and to use it as common property. The words of a given culture become its store of "sedimented meanings" which can be taught to others and handed down to posterity. Such sedimented meanings are the very basis of human culture and, taken together as a collective expres- sion of experience, they constitute the world-view of a given linguistic community. Thanks to the sedimentation of meaning in words man can "live in language," he can create the sub-universes of poetry, religion, history, philosophy and science.5 He can live on levels of meaning several times removed from the primary world of perception. (4) Finally, given words carry the mark of the historical (sedimented) circumstances of their origin and use in ever new ways across history. When, for instance, in the history. of philosophy we speak of "belief in Hume's sense," of a "Kantian category" or a "Hegelian idea" we thereby designate, by a kind of historical shorthand, the distinctive meaning 5 The expression "sub-universes" in this sense was coined by William James, Principles of Psychology, II, chap. 21; cf. also Alfred Schuetz, "On Multiple Reali- ties" in Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, 1945, pp. 533-57.</page><page sequence="6">EXPRESSION AND METAPHOR 543 impressed on our general vocabulary by a great mind. To the extent that this element is important in our use of terms in philosophy, we can say that the appresentational structure of words involves a fourth dimension of- reference: namely to the philosopher or thinker who first defined (or re-defined) a word in an original and systematic manner. As. we shall see this is particularly important for metaphorical words. which have a life of their own and remain a historical force even when their metaphorical character has been forgotten. Reference to their original meaning is there in the sedimented history of the words themselves. 3. Meaning and Expression. Meaning can be (phenomenologically) defined as the noematic corre- late of experience. Meaning is what is. experienced and consequently what we attempt to express in behavior, in gesture, in language. All experience is experience of something. Meaning arises only in the noetic-noematic contact with reality which we call experience of.... Words, thus, are not meanings; a word or a series of words may point to -a meaning, but any number of words - including words yet to be invented - can be used to clarify and define a meaning by designating its various aspects and thus delineating its structure. A meaning is never exhaustively expressed in any one word or even in any combination of words; meaning always transcends any given attempt at its verbal expression.6 Ordinarily, in using language, we attend not to the words we are using but to the meaning which they appresent; we see through expressions to what they express, we live naturally on multiple levels of meaning, and it is only by 6 It is clear that not all syntactic elements distinguished in a given language carry meaning of themselves when isolated from their linguistic "environment." Moreover, cultures have divided their words in many very diverse ways. Some languages are highly inflexional like Latin, Greek and Russian for instance, and it may normally require twice as many words to render (roughly) the same meaning in an "analytical" language like English as Latin requires. Highly analytical languages, like English and Chinese, have large numbers of words which have little or no semantic value when isolated from their complements. Other languages, like those of the Eskimos, some American Indians and some Siberian tribes, are "polysynthetic" and they may express whole sentences of an Indo-European tongue in one word. Still others, like German and Turkish, are highly agglutinative and are able to string together words to form complexes which we can translate only by elaborate circumlocutions. Thus it is clear that one word does not mean one meaning, and because people think and speak in terms of meanings rather than words, they normally think and speak in complex phrases and sentences, not simple words. The meanings of words are much larger and more inclusive than any series of given words used to express them. For this reason it is impossible to restrict the analysis of meaning narrowly to the analysis of sedimented verbal expressions. No one word can be understood except in terms of the whole linguistic horizon (or "language game") of which it is a part.</page><page sequence="7">544 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH a special effort of attention that we can focus our attention on words as such. Words are only the vehicles of meaning. In order to clarify the phenomenological approach to meaning and ex- pression it may be helpful to distinguish it from abstract, logical analysis. The meanings we are speaking of are not clear and distinct ideas, nor are they "concepts" of the kind isolated, analyzed and defined through the logical analysis of language. The concepts with which logical analysis deals, which it tries to sort out and define as exhaustively as possible can be called "closed" concepts, by which I mean clearly circumscribed, fully defined ideas. The goal of logical analysis is to render ideas as clear and distinct as, the p's and q's of mathematical logic. But since all expression is appresentational in structure, since all language refers, to experience, the meanings incarnate in verbal expression are hardly ever simple "closed" ideas. In short, we cannot analyze language without including reference (1) to what the person or community of persons using this language mean and (2) to the structure of the world-meaning thus perspectivally appre- sented. There is a multiple relativity in all linguistic expression and there- fore in all thought about experience. For this reason phenomenology defines meaning as, an "open" structure, as a non-fixed eidos which can be approached perspectivally from an indefinite number of possible viewpoints but which can never be "pos- sessed" wholly and completely under any one aspect. Meaning transcends all of its expressions; it is an eidetic structure (like a Kantian idea) which is the pole (noematic correlate) of -an indefinite number of converging signifying acts but which will always escape exhaustive analysis. We can define world-meanings progressively and render them more and more explicit, but however far we carry our attempt to express them, there will always be more to say. The phenomenological clarification of experience is an infinite task, which, in principle, must be unending. Language is not composed of a number of discrete signs or symbols each with its own clear, little, unequivocal signification; all of our'signs and symbols together allude to a meaning which fixes our attention and about which we dis- course but which is never totally or exhaustively expressed. By means of expression (attending to experience) world-phenomena (meanings) can be more or less morphologically fixed through intersub- jective constitution. But they remain possessed of an essential relativity. Though we all experience and express the same meanings (as we all live in the world), no two persons experience or understand the same thing concerning them in every respect. For this reason phenomenology is forced, by its fidelity to experience, to consider meaning as intrinsically ambiguous. By a special effort of abstraction it is possible, of course, to construct clear and distinct ("univocal") concepts for use in very restricted domains of language. But whenever these concepts are situated in relation</page><page sequence="8">EXPRESSION AND METAPHOR 545 to their experiential referents and viewed as expressions of experience, they reveal their intrinsic multiple relativity (i.e., their intrinsic "ambi- guity"). 4. Metaphorical Expressions. We have said enough to indicate that the phenomenological elucidation of meaning and expression is not merely a problem of the "philosophy of mind." Man is not a pure consciousness. It is not sufficient to consider man as being or having a "mind" that refers, categorizes, thinks and sym- bolizes clear and distinct interior mental ideas by means of external physical signs. Such a view is simplistic in that it reduces man to one of his functions and considers him as a disembodied "thinker." Man is not a pure consciousness; he becomes conscious little by little, with great effort, in the company of other men, across great lapses of historical time. Man's existence is spread out in time and space; he does not possess him- self in pure immanent self-reflexive tranquillity. Through the invention and use of language (and expression in general) man is enabled to orient himself in the confused world of lived experience. He is enabled to put order into his experience of the world, and, by so doing, to become gradually' human. Thanks to the intersubjective constitution of meaning operated through language, man is enabled to become gradually aware of himself, of others and of the world as the transcendent "horizon" of expe- rience. All of this is to say that man as a whole is intentional of the world. His primary orientation is outward, he is first of all lost in the experience of things and it is through and in this intentional involvement with the world that he is able to become aware of his own transcendence as the "experiencer." I would like here to illustrate the phenomenological theory of man as a world-intending organism from the point of view of his use of language in becoming aware of lived experience. More particularly, I will limit this discussion to what is ordinarily called metaphorical language, first to a brief discussion of metaphor in general and then to a consideration of a few fateful metaphors which have molded Western thought in the supposedly most "detached" realms of philosophical speculation. Philosophers have traditionally adopted very superior attitudes with respect to metaphors. Metaphors, we are told, belong to poetry, "emotive" literature and anthropomorphic theology; philosophy does not need them and ought to avoid them. But the whole question is to know whether metaphors can be avoided and whether philosophers (or anyone else) should avoid their use. This much is certain: nearly the whole of extant, historical language consists of built up layers of metaphorical expression, and philosophers have been able to claim that they have escaped the hold</page><page sequence="9">546 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH of metaphorical language only because of their ignorance of the nature of language.7 Since language is intrinsically appresentational of experi- ence and therefore "anthropocentric," it is hardly surprising that it should be largely "anthropomorphic" as well. From the beginnings of language men have invested objects of thought with the familiar aspects of the lived human body and its processes. If we attempt to resolve thought (in the form of language) into its primitive elements, we do not discover timeless, logical structures but experienced life-world events in terms of which historical man has oriented himself in concrete existence. Here we are not primarily concerned with the "painting with words" used in poetry and literature, nor with elaborate simile, parable or other recherche' forms of metaphorical thought used to evoke "mental pictures," etc. We are concerned with the more fundamental metaphors which, con- secrated by long use, have lost their power to evoke images and thus -are no longer recognized as metaphorical. There are many categories of hidden or "dead" metaphors of this kind. Some of the most fundamental for language, and therefore for thought, are derived from the lived expe- rience of bodily processes, from perceptual experience, from sensation, from lived-space and lived-time.8 As a result the metaphorical use of such locutions as above-below, near-far, interior-exterior, open-closed, light-darkness, before-after, right-left, front-behind, simply cannot be avoided even in the most purified meta-language. The metaphorical character of these expressions goes unrecognized because they have passed so completely into common usage on all levels that we do not advert to them any more. Like the life-world, they are too close to us to be- seen without special effort, they are too familiar. And this more than anything shows that the logical analysis of language is not sufficient of itself to clarify completely the expressive structure of language. We must go down underneath the sedimented expressions of common usage 7 There is an amusing statement by Aquinas in this connection in his commentary on the De Anima of Aristotle, I, 8: "Plato habuit malum modum docendi. Omnia enim figurate dicit, et per symbola docet: intendens aliud per verba, quam sonent ipsa verba; sicut quod dixit animum esse circulum. Et ideo ne aliquis propter ipsa verba incidat in errorem, Aristoteles disputat contra eum quantum ad id quod verba eius sonant" (italics mine). We can almost hear Bertrand Russell comparing Frege to Bergson. 8 This is a difficult and important linguistic question which we can only allude to here. The eight original cases of nouns in Indo-European languages (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, vocative, instrumental, locative and ablative) seem to indicate primarily spatial or directional relationships for which, in English, we now rely mainly on "prepositions" like at, of, to, towards, by, with, in, from, etc. Whether a language uses inflexions, prepositions or postpositions is seems that some means of designating primordial spatial relationships such as these are among the most primitive elements around which words are built up.</page><page sequence="10">EXPRESSION AND METAPHOR 547 to their experiential rootsT. In so doing we can come to a better under- standing of what language is and why it presents philosophical problems. But what is a metaphor? Again, we must begin with the life-world of perceptual experience. The impossibility of speaking on any level of meaning without using words denoting primary perceptual life-world phenomena is itself a demonstration of the primacy of perception and what phenomenologists call the "natural attitude" in our experience. This has been admirably defended by Maurice Merleau-Ponty in his Pheno- menologie de la perception. That man must, first of all, speak in terms of his primary perceptual experience is an immediate result of the intentional structure of experience. There is a prehensive contact with the real (Whitehead) or a compresence with sensibly experienced things (Alexan- der), an existential "togetherness" with reality which precedes and under- lies all thought about reality, all reflexive cognition. Perception precedes apperception. We have already seen that the instrumentality of words derives from their being more flexible, more subtle forms of bodily gestures. And there seems to be little doubt that the most primitive words used to designate bodily processes, sensations, spatial and temporal relationships are pri- marily gestural.9 Originally they serve only to distinguish and designate primary perceptions. But such words can then be used not merely to name things or to point out and distinguish perceptual experiences but also to enable us to bring within our ken and to comprehend new, hitherto unnamed phenomena. A word which primarily designates a per- ceptual phenomenon, for example, the perception of light, once consti- tuted, is available for a new purpose and can be used with a new inten- tion, for example, to denote the process of intellectual understanding, and we speak of (mental) illumiation. Once established, the metaphorical use of the original word is no longer noticed; its essential ambiguity tends to fall below the level of awareness from the moment that it is taken as designating another, now distinguishable, experience. With metaphors, as with all words, what fixes our attention is not primarily the verbal expres- sion itself but that of which we are speaking through words. The meta- phorical use of the word takes its place beside the primary sense of the 9Cf. N. H. Tur-Sinai, 'The Origin of Language," Language: An Enquiry into its Meaning and Function, ed. R. N. Anshen, New York, 1957, pp. 41-79. According to Tur-Sinai's theory, "Prior to names and to any concrete term, language... had short demonstrative words serving to point out and refer to the simplest relations: here and there, above and below, flat, pointed, and the like" which were neither singular nor plural, masculine nor feminine, nouns nor verbs, etc. They were rather primitive "adverbs" which gradually turned into nouns, then into verbs, then were divided into singular and plural forms, etc. (pp. 50 ff.). Whatever the merits of his theory, Tur-Sinai has admirably illustrated the gestural origin of words.</page><page sequence="11">548 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH word as the denotation of a distinct meaning. Moreover, metaphors of this kind are never "fixed pictures"; like all words they point to distinctive human life-world experiences. They originate in the practical need to progress from "known" (already distinguished, already named) pheno- mena to what is as yet unknown and unnamed. In principle, no experience, no aspect of experience is incapable of being named and thus made public. It is only because of his perceptual insertion in the world that man adopts a certain metaphorical economy in his language, using primary perceptual categories to designate expe- riences of a more complex and derivative.nature. But any world-pheno- menon, no matter how complex or derivative, once it has been named, becomes by that very fact suitable material for later figurative or meta- phorical use. We build metaphors on metaphors as we progress from the "already-known" towards the "not-yet-known." The metaphorical use of words appears. as the primary instrument of the discovery of "new" meaning. The first modem philosopher of language, Giambattista Vico, devel- oped a nonrationalistic theory of metaphor which, I believe, basically coincides with what I am saying here. Following his cardinal linguistic principle that "minds" are formed by language and not language by "minds," Vico gives a surprisingly lucid account of the origin of meta- phorical language.10 "The human mind," he writes, "is naturally inclined by the senses to see itself externally in the body, and only with great difficulty does it come to understand itself by means of reflexion." 11 And he states his "universal principle of etymology in all languages" as follows: "words are carried over from bodies and from the properties of bodies to signify the institutions of the mind and the spirit. The order of ideas must follow the order of institutions." 12 Metaphorical language is a necessity of human expression and thought because man is naturally constrained to proceed from a few expressions that directly signify his. most essential sensory life to the extension of this limited vocabulary to cover ever wider purposes of thought and communication. Two princi- ples, according to Vico, govern the creation of metaphors: (1) the newly disclosed phenomenon is given the name of a previously named pheno- menon that in some salient way resembles it, and (2) we tend to discover this resemblance in that aspect of the phenomenon-to-be-named which most powerfully calls forth direct perceptual experience, or direct human 10 Book II, "On Poetic Wisdom" in The New Science, tr. Bergin and Fisch, Cornell University Press, 1948. 11 Ibid., p. 70, italics mine. 12 Ibid. I have followed the translation of the revised edition (Anchor Books, 1961) in rendering cose as "institutions" rather than "things."</page><page sequence="12">EXPRESSION AND METAPHOR 549 needs, processes, and interests which have already been named.'3 Vico's theory of language is extremely valuable in showing that metaphors are not the enemies of serious thinking. They are not accidental "weaknesses" of human thought which could be avoided if only we were more astute and tried a little harder. It is distinctive of the "human condition" that the metaphorical use of words cannot be avoided. Our goal cannot be to escape metaphorical usage but only to understand its function. Nevertheless, so long as metaphorically used words retain their original designative function alongside their superadded metaphorical function or functions, there is always the danger that they will take their own subtle revenge - and this is particularly true of the most fundamental metaphors derived from immediate perceptual experience. Once men have culturally organized their experience in a distinctive manner, and chosen their meta- phors, they tend to think within the cultural-linguistic bounds that they have unwittingly set up for themselves. They no longer think as they will but as they can. For this reason it is a very fortunate thing for the human race that it does not speak one language only but has developed many different linguistic world-views. Different linguistic cultures (and even sub-cultures within a given linguistic community) organize their experi- ence in distinctive ways. Thus through intercultural cross-fertilization (bi- lingualism, multi-lingualism) men are able with greater or lesser effort to break through the established linguistic sedimentations which constrict and limit their use of language. As a corollary it seems reasonable to suppose that linguistic analysis, at least in so far as it is directed towards the clarification of experienced meaning, can be successful only to the extent that it is based on the analysis of more than one (and preferably several) styles of linguistic expression. The empirical basis for serious linguistic analysis must be multi-lingualism. 5. Metaphors in Philosophy. In order to illustrate the hold of metaphorical expression even on the level of fully reflexive categorial thought, let us turn briefly to the "sub- universe" of Western philosophy. One of the areas in which philosophers have tried, almost from the beginning, to think as clearly as possible is in the realm of what now goes under the title of epistemology. Since the life of the philosopher is a life of "thinking," of theoria said the Greeks, nearly all philosophers have thought about thought and have attempted "3 Though I have synthesized and stated Vico's theory in a less archaic vocabulary, I trust I have rendered it faithfully. If this theory is correct, so far as it goes, it should free us once and for all from the rationalistic search for the tertium quid comparationis as the key to understanding metaphors. Metaphor is much more than a sub-class of analogy.</page><page sequence="13">550 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH to come to grips with the subtle and elusive phenomena of thinking, knowing, understanding, comprehending, etc. In doing so they have relied on a number of fruitful metaphors invented at the dawn of Greek philo- sophy, which became quickly sedimented in the philosophical tradition and which have continued to guide Western epistemological investigations down to the present day. In his extremely important work, The Discovery of the Mind, Bruno Snell illustrates the impossibility of speaking about the mind, the intel- lect or consciousness itself without "falling back on metaphor." At least in so far as the Western intellectual tradition is concerned, it is clear from historical studies of language that the "mind" was not discovered until about the time of Homer or shortly afterwards. It -was not that pre- Homeric man was incapable of what we now term "mental" or psycho- logical experiences (emotion, imagination, reflexion, knowledge, etc.) but rather that he had not yet clearly distinguished processes of this kind within the great flux of worldly experience. We find, further, that when mental operations or processes were first named, they were named by means of a metaphorical use of the terminology of sensation, particularly that of sight. A long preparation was necessary before it became possible to name even the primary sensory processes. Professor Snell cites a great number of early Greek terms used to designate the phenomenon of seeing and it is clear that these expressions are themselves primarily metaphor rical, at least in the sense that they did not originally designate the expe- rience of seeing in its specificity. Man is intentionally oriented towards the world and only by being conscious of the world can he become con- scious of his consciousness of the world. Thus he distinguishes aspects and qualities of sight before he is, able to recognize sight as such. By way of example, let us take one of the early terms Professor Snell has analyzed: Derkesthai (J&amp;pKEOrO9C) means: to have a particular look in one's eyes. Drakon (t6p9fKwv), the snake, whose name is derived from derkesthai, owes this designation to the uncanny glint of his eye. He is called "the seeing one," not because het can see particularly well, not because his sight functions exceptionally well, but because his stare commands attention. By the same token Homer's derkesthai refers not so much to the function of the eye as to its gleam as noticed by someone else. It denotes an "expressive signal" or "gesture" of the eyes.14 It becomes extremely plausible, on the basis of such investigations as those being made by Professor Snell and others, that every word was originally a designation of a concrete world-phenomenon, that it called forth an extremely concrete image, that it -was primarily a gesture.

This is what we mean when we say that if thought is analyzed into its primi- tive elements, we will find not logical structures (which are in actuality highly derived and much later) but the experienced life-world itself as the a prior condition of any expression whatsoever.'5 Let us continue with Professor Snell:. The words which were later combined to form the principal parts of the verb "to see": horan (opdv), idein (LEv), opsesthai (6pEaoxt), show that to begin with there was no one verb to refer to the function of sight- as such, but that there were several verbs each designating a specific type of vision.'6 Man acquired his power to designate even the primary sensory processes with great effort. Even the later and more technical term for sight, the one adopted by Plato and Aristotle for philosophical contemplation, theorein (&amp;opEb), was not originally a verb but a noun, theoros ( oo'dg), meaning "to be a spectator," from which it derived its later meaning of "looking at," ultimately "to contemplate." Here, clearly, the same word was used to designate in a confused way both seeing (the optical pheno- menon) and intellectual comprehension, and this is even more clear with the term noein (voeiv), which in early Greek "stands for a type of seeing which involves not merely visual activity but the mental act which goes with the vision." 17 It was probably through the use of this word, noein (vo8 v, voog), that the Greeks were first enabled to distinguish clearly the experience of "thinking" as such. Then, through the process of analogy so important in the evolution of language, the classical word for sight, idein, also came to designate (especially in the form eidenai, 811voct) the process of thinking, since- the word for thought, noein, also meant, in its primary sense, "to see." -Professor Snell has shown that in early Greek the eye served as the "model for the absorption of experiences" 18 and we can add that the earliest epistemological vocabulary is therefore a vocabulary of seeing. Here we have neither the time nor the need to pursue Snell's analyses further. This much is clear: at least in the development of the Greek language man is known to have proceeded in his noetic effort of naming 15 The word "primitive" in this connection does not refer to history. It should not be necessary to remark that the search for the metaphors lying beneath the surface of words is not merely a question of historical etymology. The etymology of words may occasionally guide research but a word may be influenced by historical metaphors or carry a metaphorical sense which has nothing whatever to do with its etymology. 16 Snell, op. cit., p. 4. 1t Ibid., p. 13. 15 Ibid., p. 18.</page><page sequence="15">552 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH experiences from the recognition of what we call world-phenomena or meaning-structures in his primary life-world, to the naming of the parti- cular acts or processes of experiencing by which he is, revealed to himself as the experience, finally to the distinguishing and. naming of various levels of this experiencing. This is, of course, a very rough and simplified schema; what we are interested in is the metaphorical use of words at each step of the process, the building of metaphors, on metaphors which enabled man little by little to extend his ability to discover and express meaning.'9 Human comprehension involves metaphor at every step.20 On the basis of Professor Snell's studies we can conclude that one of the primary, if not the primary epistemological metaphor requires, us to think of thinking as a kind of seeing. The metaphor of "intellectual sight" lies beneath a vast area of our Western epistemological vocabulary: eidos, eidetic, idea, ideation, intuition, theory, theorize, and the whole cluster of more directly "optical" expressions such as reflect, speculate, focus, view, inspect, introspect, insight, outlook, perspective, etc. It, no doubt, also accounts for the frequency with which we use the metaphor of light or illumination (and words connected with these phenomena) to discuss the process of thought, since in order to see men must have light. It is extre- mely doubtful whether the metaphor of light or the conception of the intellect as a lumen naturale will ever. be discarded. The other sensory realm most important as a source of expressions for denoting mental operations and processes is that of touch (as gained through the use of the hands). CVico believed that the Latin vocabulary for knowledge was especially conditioned by the fact that when the Romans entered history they were a strictly agricultural people. When they needed words for the processes of understanding and thinking, they 19 It is not necessary to go through the entire pre-philosophical vocabulary of knowledge to make this point. To take a last example, the family of words related to the Greek gignoskein (y"yVWoKetv), such as cognoscere in Latin, connaltre in French, recognize in English, originally signified "to be with" and then "to recognize" in the sense of "seeing or meeting the same person again." It designated the ability to identify other persons - as one recognizes one's friends, acquaintances, one's comrades in battle, etc. We have in the distinctive use of this word (i.e., for persons rather than for things) a primitive awareness of the distinction between "knowing" an aspect of the environment in an impersonal way and "knowing" a person (cf. the German wissen and kennen). For that reason the term gignoskein and its cognates is a much richer, while remaining a much vaguer, term than noein or idein. It seems to have been used originally for any knowledge of another person and frequently designated sexual knowledge of another. In most ancient languages we find a Word for knowing (cf. know in English) which is also used for the most intimate personal relationships. In knowledge we are "together with" what we know. 20 Snell, op. cit., p. 201.</page><page sequence="16">EXPRESSION AND METAPHOR 553 borrowed them, according to Vico, from an already established agricul- tural vocabulary such as intelligere (to glean), disserere (to sow), to which we can add recolligere (to gather up), observare (to store away), etc.21 In any event such words have in common the fact that they refer primarily to the use of the hands, the principal instruments of the sense of touch, and such locutions as grasping, observing, apprehending, comprehending, recollecting, etc. have become commonplace in our epistemological voca- bulary. In the full light of the 18th century David Hume was not better able to describe the difference between an idea that is "assented to" and a "fictitious" idea, and thus define his notion of belief, than by saying that the two felt different. It is evident, he writes, that belief consists not in the nature or order of our ideas, but in the manner of their conception, and in their feeling to the mind.... in philosophy, we can go no farther than assert that it [belief] is something felt by the mind.. 22 Having established that at least some philosophers know how ideas "feel," we can proceed to some of the more complex metaphors that lie beneath our epistemological notions. It is not the purpose of this limited study to go through the whole "spectrum of the senses"; 23 it is sufficient to show how some of the categories which belong primarily to the realm of sensory experience have been taken into technical philosophy. Among the dialogues of Plato the Theaetetus and the Sophist have a privileged place in this regard. Not only did they mark a point of crisis, a turning-point, in the development of Plato's own thought; they also scored a number of firsts in fixing philosophical terminology which it would be unwise to say that Western philosophy, at least up to Heidegger, has ever broken through. Besides fixing for the first time a large number of technical philosophical terms and thus making mature philosophical thought possible for the first time, Plato, in his later dialogues, and par- ticularly in the Theaetetus and the Sophist, gave us a series of epistemo- logical metaphors in his statement of the problem of knowledge which have for twenty-three centuries supported the whole edifice of Western epistemological speculation and sometimes collapsed under the weight. Without in any way attempting to be exhaustive, let us single out a few of these metaphors and sketch in a very preliminary way their historical influence. 21 Cf. R. G. Collingwood, The Idea of History, Oxford University press, 1946, p. 70. 22 David Hume, A Treatise of Human Nature, Everyman edition, p. 100. 23 This usage is from Erwin Straus, "Aesthesiology and Hallucinations" in Existence, ed. May, Angel and Ellenberger, New York, 1958, p. 157.</page><page sequence="17">554 PHILOSOPHY- AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH The first of these, probably originated by Socrates, is the notion of thought as conception.24 We find Plato's fullest account of the Socratic maieutic in the introduction to the Theaetetus (148e-151d).25 The young Theaetetus is discovered to be "suffering the pains of travail," about to give.birth to an idea which he has within him but which he cannot get out until Socrates offers to serve as his "midwife." Socrates claims to be a midwife of the soul who can judge (1) whether a man's mind "has ever conceived at all" or "whether it is barren," (2) when it is "in labor with some thought it has conceived" and thus "about to give birth," and (3) whether the resultant concept is a "real child" or a mere "wind-egg," the result of a "miscarriage" or an "abortion." This is Socrates' "special art" and, thanks to his skillful practice in this case, Theaetetus says he is able "to give utterance to more than I had in me" (21.0b). In the Meno the emphasis had been on "recollecting" (anamnesis) with great effort and by means of a dialectical interrogation ideas which the soul already knew, had already seen. As we have seen, the word idea comes from the word for sight whereas a concept is something produced by effort and requires the assistance of another, if not for its creation, at least for its production (its expression). We can speak of innate ideas; it would be odd to speak of innate concepts. In the later dialogues Plato is carried along by his own metaphor to say things which can be reconciled with his "metaphysical" theory of ideas only with difficulty. He maintains throughout that what he means by ideas (or forms, or kinds) are not mere mental. events or psychic creations; ideas are the eternal, subsistent objects of thought. Yet, under the impetus of this metaphor of knowledge as con- ception, he is led more and more to focus his. attention on the productive element in thinking, on the effort required to discover and formulate an idea, on the arduous interpersonal dialectic required to bring forth these 24 Again, note that this is a question not of etymology but of metaphor. The only primarily "sexual" term to receive a place in Plato's technical philosophical vocabulary was koinonia (KOWvcvOciO), "intercourse," used by Plato both for the "intercourse" of the soul with its objects of knowledge (whether through sensation or intellectual intuition) and for the "participation" or "combining" of ideas among themselves (cf. Francis M. Cornford, Plato's Theory ofKnowledge, New York, 1957, pp. 47, 239, 255-256). The actual word for conception, kyein (Kv'stv), though used in the relevant passages where this metaphor is developed, never became in Greek, as it did in Latin and in our language, a technical philosophical term. The metaphor of knowledge as conception was simply attached to the already existing epistem- ological vocabulary (of sight). The metaphors behind words thus cannot be simply deduced from their etymologies. 25 In quoting from the Theaetetus and the Sophist I am using Cornford's translation, with one or two minor alterations, since I judge it to be far superior to all the others available. In quoting from the Symposium I have relied mainly on Lamb's translation in the Loeb Classical Library edition though it has been necessary to re-translate certain words.</page><page sequence="18">EXPRESSION AND METAPHOR 555 already seen meanings. The conception-metaphor requires a greater place for man the active. "thinker" as the source, not perhaps of the ideas, 'but of all knowledge of the ideas. Socrates, the midwife, claimed to be barren; in fact it was a necessity of the metaphor that the midwife (the dialectical interrogator) be beyond the age of "child-bearing." Hence,. Socrates' continual refrain that he himself "knows nothing," and that his only ability is a certain gift he has for helping others bring forth what they already know but. cannot say. Nevertheless, the sense of this metaphor as it is used in the Theaetetus (with reference to the dialectical begetting of knowledge) and in the Symposium and the Phaedrus (with reference to the begetting of virtue) clearly involves active intellectual intercourse and mutual impregnation. In the Theaetetus Socrates states that, as a good midwife, he is also a good "matchmaker." He can tell when the union of two s-ouls. will be mutually "advantageous for the good" and thus fruitful of ideas, and when it will be a barren union that can only result in miscarriages. Many who have not been conscious of my assistance but have made light of me, thinking it was all their own doing, have left me sooner than they should... and thenceforward suffered miscarriage of their thoughts through falling into bad company; and they have lost the children of whom I had delivered them by bringing them up badly, caring more for false phantoms than for the true ... When they come back and beg for a renewal of our intercourse with extravagant protestations, sometimes the divine warning that comes to me forbids it; with others it is permitted, and these begin again to make progress (150e-lSta). The necessity of impregnation in order to conceive is even more stressed in the Symposium and the Phaedrus though there the fruit of dialectical intercourse is "virtue" or "the good," or "spiritual beauty" (which of course are only other ways of saying "true knowledge" in Plato's sense). Here the "pregnancy of the soul" and "procreation in the beautiful" does not result from a mere anamnesis (remembering) but from the active intellectual intercourse of thoroughbred souls.26 26 Cf. Republic 490a, Symposium, 206c-207b, 208e-209c, 212a, Phaedrus, 246b ff., 251a-252e This is no exhaustive list of the passages in which this metaphor occurs, but in the event that the reader may feel I am exaggerating Plato's reliance on the image of physical intercourse, or has been misled by Victorian translations from the Greek, an examination of the terminology of these passages should be sufficient. In the Republic, loc. cit., Plato applies' the metaphor to the knowledge of reality: the soul is moved by "passion" (8pwog) for being; it "approaches and marries" being (nyCrtda;Og KGU putysi); through this union it "begets" (yevv'aocg) knowledge and is finally freed from the pains of "travail" (d.bivog). In-.the Symposium all men are declared to be "pregnant (KVei9aL, 206c), overflowing with desire "to beget and bring forth" (TbKT&amp; KOC yevve, 206d); they approach "the beautiful one" in order "to engender and beget in the beautiful" (r g yevvacvewg KG4 To5 TOKOV &amp;V TC KCadt 206e). The soul is "set on fire" (dnrcsJevog, 209c) and "consorts" (dytAW-v) with the</page><page sequence="19">556 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH In the Theaetetus and the Sophist the conception-metaphor is given a still wider application in Plato's developing theory of knowledge.27 Sen- sation according to Plato is the intercourse between the soul and the world of becoming. "We have intercourse with Becoming by means of the body through sense, whereas we have intercourse with Real -being by means of the soul through reflection" (Sophist, 248a). The metaphor of sexual intercourse runs through Plato's analysis of sense-perception as well as through his theory of the dialectical interrelations of ideas.28 This strong metaphor recommended itself to Aristotle, the biologist, and through him to the medieval Aristotelian tradition, and' finally, through Oxford, to modem empiricism. According to Thomas Aquinas, for example, the intentiones sensuum (sense data) flow into the soul ("in- fluunt nobis") and impregnate the passive intellect which then reacts and conceives a conceptum (verbum mentis). 29 But the Theaetetus gives us yet a more important and more fateful metaphor. imagine then, says Socrates ... that our minds contain a block of wax... and say that whenever we wish to remember something we see or hear or conceive in our own minds, we hold this wax under the perceptions or ideas and imprint theamon it as we might stamp the impression of a signet-ring. Whatever is so imprinted we remember and know so long as the image remains... (19lc-d).30 The whole "empiricist" habit of speaking of knowledge in terms of impressions begins here. Aristotle took it up as an authentic description of the state of the mind before its awakening by sensation: the mind, he says, is like a (blank, wax) "writing-tablet on which as yet nothing actu- ally stands written." 31 From Aristotle, through Aquinas, to Locke -and fair one in order to "conceive"' (K5e8t), "bear" (-r'Kwet) and "give birth" (yFvv4, 209c). Such words as dvocet "to encounter," aVmivotC "to come together," and KOlVcVtiOC, "intercourse" also occur frequently in this sense. Thus there is a "pregnancy of the soul" (sv walg VvpXcl KvOiutv, 209a) which results from the marriage of the soul with truth (beauty, goodness) and whose fruit is virtue and knowledge (212a). Cf. also A. E. Taylor, Plato, London, 1926, pp. 227 ff. As concerns the Theaetetus and the Sophist, I refer the reader to Cornford's excellent translation of the passages cited and to his commentary, op. cit., especially pp. 27 f., 47, 239, 246-247, 255-257. 27 Cf.

At -the same time, because of his own interests and the "naturalis- tic" cast of his thought, Aristotle (and some of his followers) tended to "biologize" this rather mechanical metaphor. Thus the metaphor' of the assimilation of reality by the mind (like the assimilation of food by the body) was conjoined to the tabula rasa metaphor in empiricist epistemo- logy, and it has exercised a subtle influence on philosophers of all per- suasions ever since. This "alimentary epistemology" as Sartre has termed it cuts a wide swath in Western thought.32 To his wax-tablet image of consciousness Plato added another which, though it did not "catch on" in the same way, has been the more influ- ential in that it does not so narrowly require an "empiricist" approach to knowledge for its adoption. Philosophers have not often spoken of the mind as an aviary, but they have never ceased speaking of it as container or receptacle in which more or less elusive ideas (whether innate or "captured" from without) are moving and associating with one another in unpredictable patterns (Theaetetus, 196d-199b). It is not here a question of whether or not it is possible or desirable to avoid such locutions as "the contents of consciousness" or "the contents of the mind." Heraclitus gave Western philosophy the notion of the soul as something "deep"; we still speak of "depth-psychology," of ideas and feelings as being "profound" or "superficial," etc. The inner logic of such metaphors and the necessity of their use has still to be delineated. In fact, it has usually gone altoge- ther unnoticed by philosophers. It is not my intention to suggest that we can express ourselves, even in philosophy, without the use of metaphors, but only to suggest that their analysis requires a method which will lead us back to the experience-meanings they appresent. There appears to be a specificity of metaphorical expression which philosophers have too long neglected, and, since nearly all language is metaphorical, no philosophy of language can be complete until this problem is properly situated. To conclude, let us examine very briefly two of our contemporary epistemological metaphors. The first concerns meaning only, since Witt- genstein, unlike Husserl, did not focus his attention primarily on consci- ousness or experience as the condition of meaning.33 But he did focus on meaning and the complex, open vague, and ambiguous interrelations, which 32 J.-P. Sartre, Situations I, Paris, 1947, p, 31. 33 I do not know of any specifically Wittgenstinian metaphor for consciousness unless it is that of the fly in the fly-bottle, entrapped by the web of meanings it cannot get through: "Was ist dein Ziel in der Philosophie? - Der Fliege den Ausweg aus dem Fliegenglas zeigen." Philosophical Investigations, Oxford, 1958, p. 103.</page><page sequence="21">558 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH constitute the "family resemblances" of words. The philosophical analysis of meaning, according to Wittgenstein, consists in sorting out and tracing as best we can the many criss-crossing and interweaving threads that go to make up the strands of meaning in ordinary discourse. No single thread runs through the whole of a given strand, but the "continuous overlapping of fibers" leads us from one to another in a way that makes it possible for us to organize a "family" of interrelated meanings. In short, Wittgenstein views language as a complex, interlocking, tangled skein of meanings whose multiple and complex interrelations. it is the job of philosophy to discover and distinguish. It is noteworthy that this metaphor of meaning as a fabric is also an ancient one, though it was not much used between the time of Plato and Wittgenstein. Plato also conceived of his dialectical method as a study of the "texture of discourse." Plato's ideas or forms are the meanings. referred to in all discourse and which are all "woven together" in a vast network.34 This network or fabric of the forms (objective meanings) constitutes the real reality for Plato, and according to him the work of the philosopher is to trace the interrelationships of this articulate structure. Dialectic is the science of "knowing how to distinguish in what ways the several Kinds can or cannot combine." 35 The metaphor of" weaving ("the art of com- bining," synkritike, avy7xeTrtyx) and of tracing or distinguishing already woven meanings ("the art of separating," diakritike, btaxQtlrtXq) is frequent in Plato's later dialogues and serves to define the epistemological problem as it is posed in the Sophist and the Statesman.36 While it probably always remained present in the metaphorical background of Western philosophi- cal thought, it is Wittgenstinian linguistic philosophy which has given it a new force in contemporary epistemology. Bergson, in his radical criticism of traditional conceptualism (whether of empiricist or idealist inspiration), substituted for the reigning episte- mological notions of his day a notion of consciousness as action, "less a kind of seeing than a contact," 37 a dynamic, world-directed energy. Husserl, about the same time, elaborated a new phenomenology of con- sciousness with the aid of the ancient notion of "intention." As is usual 34"All discourse," says Plato, "consists of the weaving together (arvp).o) of Forms." Sophist, 259e. 35 Sophist, 253c. Cornford gives the whole Platonic vocabulary for the "com- bination" and "separation" of forms, op. cit., pp. 239 and 255-256.

Intendere in classical Latin meant primarily "a stretching out," ".a straining towards" and is clearly related to such locutions as attendere, "to stretch towards," and contender, "to stretch out vigorously, with effort." 38 By stressing consciousness in its active Leistung (doing), Husserl distinguished his notion of intentionality from that which Brentano, had borrowed from the Scholastics. In the Scholastics and to a lesser degree in Brentano, the emphasis is on the in-existence of objectified, ideal entities in conscious- ness (in the mind).39 But Husserl empties consciousness of all "objects" and defines it as intentional of the world in a completely de-substantialized and dynamic sense. Intendere animum in ... , as the original Latin use of the term has is, signifies for Husserl an effortful directing of consciousness towards the world. Consciousness is exertion. Consciousness is no longer passive (as in empiricism); it is essentially an activity, a spontaneity, a movement. It is a presence to things in the sense of the pre-socratic parousia (xz,-Qovaloa, presence to, directedness towards). Moreover, in virtue of this notion of intentionality, consciousness for Husserl is never a thing nor does it contain anything; as Sartre writes, there is no "inside" in consciousness: Against the digestive philosophy of empirio-criticism, of neo-kantianism, against all "psychologism," Husserl never tires of repeating that we cannot dissolve things in consciousness... Husserl sees in consciousness an irreducible fact which cannot be rendered by any physical image, except, perhaps, the rapid and obscure image of bursting forth. To know, is "to burst out towards," to tear oneself away from the clammy gastric depths to slip outside of oneself over there, towards what is not oneself... Now, consciousness is purified, it is as clear as a strong wind, there is nothing left in it, except a movement of escaping itself, a slipping outside of itself. If, by an impossible chance, you were to get "inside" a consciousness, you would be seized by a whirlwind and thrown back outside... for consciousness has no "inside."40 3s In discussing consciousness Husserl liked to use words indicating effort. Thus even when using the word Schauen (which implies the "viewing" metaphor), Husserl intensified it by inventing the neologism Er-schauen (viewing or intuition achieved through effort).

However Aquinas' commentary on the Metaphysics, IV, 4, no. 574, is more explicit on the in-existence of "intelligible intentions" in the soul, and the passage noted earlier from the Summa Theologiae, I, 78, 4, is clearer on the in-existence of the "intentions of the senses." 40 J.-P.

There is no, ques- tion of denying the necessity of metaphorical expression or of attempting to do without it. If philosophy is more than the analysis of already sedi- mented meanings, if it is a progressive clarification of experience, it will continue to develop metaphorically. The intentionality of experience means that man is dialectically related to the world and that he can only be defined in terms of the dynamic, bi-polar tension which we call expe- rience of ... One result of the primacy of perception (in the phenome- nological sense) is the metaphorical economy which man practices in all the sub-universes of meaning, including philosophy. In so, far as the phenomenological analysis of language is faithful to the "human con- dition," there is no question of analyzing metaphors, out of existence. Our task is to explain their nature and peculiar necessity. Words are only the vehicles of meaning. They are not primarily the object but the means of thought. By means of language man transcends his world, puts a distance between himself and his experience. He becomes "unstuck" from his perceptual immersion in experience by dis- tinguishing and naming its various aspects. This naming of experience is done in terms of direct human interests and needs. It is rooted in a com- mon intersubjective interest in the world. Since language is the expression, of experience, in using language our attention is directed primarily to what we are expressing (rather than to the expression of it), to what we mean, in short to the "open noetic- noematic meaning-structures given in experience. Once primary percep- tual experience has been organized in some way through the naming of various salient aspects of it, these primary "names." can then be used to distinguish and comprehend new experiences through a purposive varia- tion of the referential structure of the original words.. It is not only that the two or more meanings, designated by a given word-meaning resemble one another oir are "paired" in some way. We have seen that meaning is neither in things nor in consciousness but that it arises in the interaction of both, in the noetic-noematic encounter itself. A word becomes a meta- phor when it is used to refer with a new purpose, with a new intention, to a previously disclosed aspect of experience in order to reveal a hitherto unnamed and indistinct experience of a different kind. The metaphorical use of words thus brings about a re-organization, a re-focusing of expe- rience, which continues to grow in complexity with each further use of the word in a distinctively new sense, with each new purpose. We are able to attend to and distinguish new meanings within the</page><page sequence="24">EXPRESSION AND METAPHOR 561 experiential field by giving already established words new referents.. Through a sort of free variation we are able to "discover" relations in our experience of distinct meanings from an indefinite number of aspects or points of view. Thus we can say that "mind" for instance is a wax tablet, an aviary, a receptacle, and that "thinking" is a seeing, a feeling, a conceiving, a grasping, a stretching out towards, etc. "Mind" and "thinking" are not any of these things but the imperfectly expressed experiences which we designate by these words are experienced in a way which makes their expression by means of these references, from these points of view, peculiarly apt - though an indefinite number of other points of view always remain "open." Note, further, that since several metaphorically used words name the same phenomenon (more or less adequately), each under one of its aspects as we intend it, their primary designation tends to become gradually obscured as we learn to "live in" and discourse about the new realm of meaning they have enabled us to uncover. These disparate metaphors tend to become synonyms in reference to the new reality they have severally made it possible to distinguish. They now designate the same reality though each word keeps its (sedimented) metaphorical speci- ficity as designating from a particular interest-perspective, for a particular purpose, etc. Thus we see that various metaphors can appresent the same experi- ence-meaning perspectivally. They place us at the viewpoint from which men have hitherto approached a given realm of experience. Each meta- phor forces us to think what it appresents through its own perspective. Metaphors are the storehouse of the previous thought of mankind. They reflect the partial, finite, limited, perspectival, intentional nature, of human consciousness. It is because man is an "incarnate" consciousness and not a pure cogito that he must think in metaphors, from points of view given in his experience. This does not mean that we are "cut off from reality" by metaphorical thought. Metaphors, like all words, are not the objects but the vehicles of thought. Across the metaphors we use we attend primarily to what they appresent. To say that we cannot escape metaphor. is to say that we cannot escape seeing reality from some point of view, that we cannot escape the "human condition." It is by learning to take successive viewpoints with reference to a given phenomenon that we delineate it more and more accurately and make it gradually "known" and "meaningful." To discover new meanings we must multiply our perspectives, which is to say we must practice a kind of free metaphorical variation and this may be the very source of intellectual (linguistic) creativity in all the "sub-universes" of meaning.
