<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Coso" Style Pictographs of the Southern Sierra Nevada ALAN PHILIP GARFINKEL Two recently discovered pictograph sites have similarities indicating common origin to the "Coso" style petroglyphs identified by Grant, Baird and Pringle (1968). These sites were located during field reconnaissance in the Southern Sierra Nevada. The two sites appear unique for two reasons: (1) they date to the late prehistoric and historic periods which pre viously have not been noted as containing "Coso" style rock art; and (2) "Coso" style pictographs are exceedingly rare and are un known for these periods. Grant, Baird, and Pringle (1968) defined a peculiar petroglyph style found within the Coso Range located in the western Mojave Desert. Petroglyphs are found on patinated basaltic cliffs and boulders and display a wealth of representational zoomorphic and anthropomorphic forms. The most recurrent zoomorphic form and that which has come to characterize this locality is the full front-facing horned and boat-shaped bodied bighorn sheep. Grant, Baird, and Pringle (1968:18) say of this pattern: This method of drawing the horns (often with ears added) is probably the most characteristic feature of the Coso sheep. Both these features are extremely rare in other parts of the west. A few isolated examples in Texas may be laid to inde pendent invention, but a single example in Nevada east of the Sierra Nevada and numbers of horn-front sheep from the middle Columbia near Vantage suggest a northern extension of Coso ideas. Pictographs in the Coso style are rare and none seem to be attributable to the late period. Grant and his associates state that In the Coso Range, there are six sites where</page><page sequence="2">96 THE JOURNAL OF CALIFORNIA ANTHROPOLOGY ^1 ^v^^^l^ * Z jgj^ / CATu&gt;-478 g | V g; /K *^f&gt;0 lndion Wells \ \ ^Vs- ?

Locations of sites with Coso style petroglyphs in the Sierra Nevada. some designs are painted, and the style indicates that they are late and done by another group of people [emphasis added]. Most if not all the late period pictograph sites in the Coso Range are abstract and bear no resemblance to the earlier period petro glyphs. Furthermore, the only "Coso" style pictograph with zoomorphic representations appears very old (Campbell Grant, personal communication). The two pictograph sites to be described here contain elements which appear similar to those found on petroglyphs in the Coso Range. Both sites appear to date to the historic period based on the representation of "Europeans" on horseback. The second site is located adjacent to a small open campsite containing pottery, which is suggested to further date the site to the late prehistoric or historic periods. The first site (C A-Ker-735) is located north of Walker Pass in Indian Wells Canyon (Figs. 1, 2). Above the drainage, on a large granite Fig. 2.

Some of these elements are superimposed on earlier ones which are mostly painted in black and red pigment. The ceiling of the shelter is fire-blackened. No artifactual remains were noted in the vicinity of the site, although a boulder containing seven bedrock mortars or "cupules" is found in front of the shelter. The panel is approximately 2 m. in width and 1 m. in height. Most significant is the depiction of men wearing hats and riding on horses (Figs. 3 and 4), thus dating the site to the period of European contact in the area. These elements would appear to date to a time around the 1860's when gold and silver mining interests attracted Whites to the region; but they could also document earlier events, such as the Bonneville trapping expedition which passed the mouth of Indian Wells Canyon in 1835. The paintings appear so fresh that the actual pigment looks as though it was smeared on and has not been absorbed into the rock. Many of the other pictograph sites in the region appear older, with no actual pigment evident but only the stained rock manifesting the designs. The question immediately arose as to whether the site could be a forgery or manufactured even later in time than pre viously suggested. In an attempt to resolve this question a scraping of the white pigment was collected and analyzed using quantitative X-ray fluorescence. Through conversations with paint special ists, it was discerned that white pigment would be amenable to analysis in this way and that it would be possible to tell, first, whether the paint is of commercial or native origin, and</page><page sequence="4">98 THE JOURNAL OF CALIFORNIA ANTHROPOLOGY Fig. 4.

White paint manufactured in the late 1800's and early 1900's was lead-based. Lead was replaced in the 1930's by titanium as the base for the white pigment, and this latter substance is still in use today. The analysis revealed the elements enumer ated in Table 1. Error factors for major constituent elements through this type of anal ysis run as high as 15% per element, so care was taken to obtain a more precise measure of lead and titanium. No lead was revealed in the sample but a trace (0.62%) of titanium was present. This percentage is much too small to have come from commerical paint where tita nium is a major constituent, amounting to 10% or more by weight. Since the pigment used apparently was not commercial paint, and the site apparently is authentic, analysis of the stylistic elements was undertaken. Fifty different elements are dis tinguishable in the pictograph panel.

Six are shown with full front-facing horns and one has side-facing horns. They are all rendered in white pigment. These sheep bear striking re semblances to elements found in the Coso Range (compare Figs. 4 and 5 with Grant, Baird, and Pringle 1968:27,61, 75, and Heizer and Clewlow 1973: Pis. 11 and 18). Another large zoomorph (Fig. 6) may be interpreted as a dog, coyote, or mountain lion. The resemblance to Coso style elements is again quite noticeable. Grant and his asso ciates have suggested that this zoomorph is a dog, as it is sometimes shown attacking moun tain sheep in petroglyph panels found in the Coso Range. Almost identical petroglyphs are illustrated in the report on the Coso rock art (Grant, Baird, and Pringle 1968:22). Heizer and Clewlow (1973:Figs. 60/ and 61c) depict other Coso glyphs illustrating this same element. Other elements in the panel include at least three recognizable horse and rider motifs all painted in white pigment. Other elements include anthropomorphs, sunbursts, chains, "shields," other abstract elements, and a very notable "flower form." This large flower form (Fig. 4) is painted in orange and white. The only other large element in orange pigment is a fading shield-like pattern. Superimposition of some elements is common with earlier designs painted in red, black, and, less frequently, white. The second pictograph site (CA-Tul-478) displaying Coso affinity is found above Lamont Meadow in the Southern Sierra Nevada (Fig. 1). The large granite boulder upon which the panel is painted orients east and is found above a stream terrace. Adjacent to the site is a small area of midden containing a sparse amount of fire-affected rock and several potsherds (type unknown). Also placed nearby are three bi facial manos, found in situ, perhaps cached by aboriginal inhabitants for future use. One of the manos is made of nonlocal material, vesic ular basalt transported from the desert floor to the east. The pictograph panel is badly faded but contains two clearly distinguishable bighorn sheep in red pigment with full front-facing horns and boat-shaped body. Also depicted is a man on horseback. This site would seem to date to the historic period, based on the presence of the horse and rider motif and its assumed contemporaneity with the adjacent archaeological locus. This would be the first documented occurrence of a Coso style picto graph outside of the desert area of the western Mojave. Both these sites appear intriguing and suggest a late reappearance of interest in ceremonialism in the form of paintings, per haps "copying" earlier petroglyph forms found in the Coso Range. The Coso Range was the territory of the ethnographically described Little Lake Shoshoni (Steward 1938:80-84). Since the Shoshoni and neighboring groups denied any knowledge of the purpose or the production of rock art, it is illuminating to learn that the actual practice continued to some extent into historic times. During his toric times, the Little Lake Shoshoni moved far south of their original territorial bound aries and most likely utilized the productive pinon stands above and adjacent to the picto graph localities described herein.
