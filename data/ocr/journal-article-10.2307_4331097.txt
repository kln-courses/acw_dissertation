<plain_text><page sequence="1">Peter Chalmers Mitchell and Antiwar Evolutionism in Britain during the Great War D. P. CROOK Department of History University of Queensland St. Lucia, Queensland, Australia 4067 This paper attempts to set the ideas of the British zoologist Peter Chalmers Mitchell in the context of a continuing tradition of "antiwar evolutionism" that arguably dominated the debate over the "biology of war" in the generation preceding World War I. This peace paradigm is briefly sketched, as are dispositions within it both towards and against deterministic modes of thought. It is then contended that despite the shock of the Great War, peace biology demonstrated great powers of survival: despite the appearance of a range of wartime theories emphasizing the congenital bellicosity of humankind - interpretations ranging from physiology and biopsychology to crowd theory and demog- raphy - peace biology continued to expound an optimistic world- view based upon Darwin's holistic ecology, and used the new discipline of eugenics to demonstrate that war was a biological disaster for Homo sapiens. Peter Chalmers Mitchell's work is viewed here as one of the more interesting restatements of peace biology to emerge during the war, not only because of his skill in reinforcing the mainstream cooperationist tradition, but also because of certain significant departures that he made from current naturalistic modes when he sought to undermine biological militarism. In opposing the uncritical use of analogy and interpretations of human nature based upon universal biological laws, he defied the tone of much biosocial speculation. He resisted determinism, including the deterministic tendencies of some brands of peace eugenics, by employing what have been labeled as "'restrictionist" arguments that barred biological science free entry to the world of human behavior and values. In doing so he amplified rumbling dissent against evolutionary ethics that existed in biology, as well as louder protestations in traditional philosophy. However, Chalmers Mitchell took the debate several steps further by incorporating into his unique mix of ideas some salient "modernist" concerns of the early twentieth century: these included concern about the Journal of the History of Biology, vol. 22, no. 2 (Summer 1989), pp. 325-356.

THE CONTEXT In the Social Darwinist world of discourse in the generation preceding World War I the militarist assessment of war as a biological necessity was offset by a strong antiwar tradition of biological thought. What united thinkers of this tradition was respect for Darwin's ecological and cooperationist ideas, often combined with Kropotkinesque zoology and stage theories of social evolution that identified recent human history with de- veloping altruism and ethicality. Influential writers like Jacques Novicow, David Starr Jordan, Vernon Kellogg, and Havelock Ellis, backed by skillful propagandists such as Norman Angell, excoriated war as dysgenic, an anachronism fated to wither away as human history moved into a more civilized and peaceful stage. ' Whereas the militant interpretation of Darwinism sustained aggressive social doctrines by offering biological justification for competition and conflict as prerequisites for evolutionary pro- gress, the antiwar tradition presented a holistic Darwinism, emphasizing coexistence in the natural world and encouraging humane and optimistic assumptions about human nature and the possibility of peace between peoples in the future. Whereas militant Darwinism fostered "reductionist" images of humanity, stressing human animality and primal aggressive, territorial instincts, immune to social control, alternative theories of social evolution suggested that humans could transcend their genes, that pugnacious primal instincts were on the way out. Peace biology focused on the optimistic aspects of Darwin's thought - his 1. E.g., Jacques Novicow: Les luttes entre socie0ts huimaines (Paris: F.

Peace biology was, nevertheless, a complex phenomenon, encompassing a range of social, political, and scientific philoso- phies, amenable to a variety of intellectual influences. Internal disagreements developed not only about the observed reality of nature, but also about the propriety of extrapolating from selection theory to social policy, or, more generally, from the "is" of the natural world to the "ought" of human behavior. The rise of the "new biology" of the 1890s and 1900s, associated with the work of August Weismann, Hugo de Vries, Karl Pearson, and W. F. R. Weldon, encouraged the rise of a style of peace eugenics - particularly strong in America - that put biology at the service of pacifism, that tended to match the biological determinism of the militarists with an opposite biological determinism. David Starr Jordan's influential Human Harvest (1907) preached that "the blood of a nation determines its history."2 Vernon Kellogg also inclined to genetic determinism, although this was qualified by his belief that "we are a reasoning species" and that war was "only an element of controllable tradition, not of ineradicable dominating heredity."3 Pseudobiology featured in antiwar as well as prowar propaganda, both sides finding biologically predetermined pat- terns in human nature and history, both sides misusing metaphor and analogy to make sweeping generalizations about humanity from animal behavior. There was, however, no inevitable nexus between the new genetics and deterministic theory. Hugo de Vries, one of the founders of mutation theory, denied any analogy between an amoral, violent natural world and human social progress.4 Peace 2. Jordan, Human Harvest, p. 39. 3.

By choosing to proclaim the unity of mankind, he denied evolutionary justifications of both racial and individual struggle.

CROOK eugenics itself was ambiguous on the issue of determinism. It may have been susceptible to images of humankind subsumed within a larger natural system, of man dominated by genes; however, it also endorsed that side of hereditarian theory that wanted control over, rather than submission to, biological laws. Peace eugenics favored the use of human reason and ingenuity to enable man to escape from a "natural" situation of chance and laissez-faire, of waste and unknown consequences, into a more scientific world that recog- nized genetic realities and manipulated them in order to create an improved human stock and a peaceful future. Peace eugenics by no means accepted an evolutionary ethic that derived values from the anarchic "is" of the natural world. It envisaged the creation of a new moral order by short-circuiting nature through the use of science and reason, which were also part of the evolutionary inheritance.5 Traditional philosophy had of course long objected to natu- ralistic ethics for deriving criteria of right conduct from the natural world and (it was said) illegitimately deducing "ought" from "is" statements.6 Such ethical systems, which included evolutionary ethics, continued to encounter strong resistance in Victorian and post-Victorian Britain as being opposed to logic, to liberal sentiment, or to rational regard for human autonomy. From the romantic tradition, and Oxford idealism in particular, came the strong affirmation that "humanity was consciously unique and truly independent of the laws of organic evolution." 7 The whole methodology of deterministic Social Darwinism, theory denying that nature was based upon struggle: "It was thus not enough merely to separate man from the natural process of development - nature itself must be purged of its Darwinian associations" (p. 73). 5. Kellogg's Beyond War reflected these ambiguities. In one breath he declared that "Man is in the big brutal grasp of this world force we call Organic Evolution, ... his nearly absolute overlord" (p. 18). He then preached the possibilities of transcending the legacy of primal evolutionary forces by means of consciousness and cultural conditioning. In the case of man, he said, factors such as "conscious environing," teaching, and control of tradition almost outweighed "the more strictly evolutionary factors, the actual heritable controls" (p. 1 52). 6.

The restrictionists rejected extrapolation from the natural to the human world, from "is" to "ought," wanting to confine science to a particular realm and to leave values outside its boundaries.8 The biologists and eugenicists who used this approach (at least on strategic occasions) included de Vries (as we have seen), T. H. Huxley, Chalmers Mitchell, Theodore Chambers, and F. A. E. Crew. Huxley, although perhaps not a consistent "restrictionist," lashed out at the naturalistic ethic in his famous Romanes lecture of 1893. It was, he said, a form of "reasoned savagery," based upon the "gladiatorial theory of existence," and its purpose was to justify the "fanatical individualism of our time." Huxley empha- sized the use of reason and normal human morality to transcend primal struggle: "Social progress means a checking of the cosmic [natural] process at every step and the substitution for it of another, which may be called the ethical process."9 As I shall show in a moment, Huxley's follower and biographer Peter Chalmers Mitchell developed the "restrictionist"' position during the war by melding metaphysical and scientific reasoning to deny that humanity was bound by deterministic laws stemming from natural, especially animal, analogies. Human ethics, he said, must be founded on sources other than science, which had no absolute validity. The wartime objections of Crew, Chambers, and others to survival-based ethical systems will be briefly treated later. By 1916 the English historian James Bryce could flatly declare that natural laws could not be applied to human events because 8. Loren R. Graham, Between Science and Values (New York: Columbia University Press, 1981), pp. 6, 8, and passim. The alternative approach is "expansionism," which uses scientific theory and findings to support conclusions about sociopolitical values. Graham produces considerable evidence substan- tiating the strength of "restrictionist" attitudes in late-nineteenth-century science. 9. T. H. Huxley, Evolution and Ethics (London: Macmillan, 1893; repr. 1911), pp. 80-82. Huxley was much criticized at the time for seeming to suggest (while at the same time denying) that the "ethical process" was nonnatural. There is some debate over Huxley's credentials as a "restrictionist." For an argument that Huxley only denied the authority of evolutionary science to causes he disapproved of, while using it to justify his own liberal social policy, see M. S. Helfand, 'T. H. Huxley's 'Evolution and Ethics': The Politics of Evolution and the Evolution of Politics," Vict. Stud., 20, 2 (1977), 159-177. S.

CROOK human sequences lacked the uniformity that belonged to things in the world of external nature."' Across the Atlantic the philosopher Ralph Barton Perry launched an angry wartime attack upon the "'new ethics" of Darwinian naturalism, which (he said) derived frightening criteria of right and wrong from an evolutionary process that in fact implied nothing as to value and offered no way of distinguishing between forms of survival. Perry opposed the biological determinism of militarists such as Karl Pearson; he preferred the moral stance of those who wanted to differentiate higher from lower struggle, or even to abolish human struggle altogether." Peace biology in the west possibly attained its zenith of vitality during the pre-1914 generation, despite the hothouse atmosphere of great power rivalries and competing doctrines of force and militarism. When these dark forces triumphed in 1914, peace biology was put under almost unendurable pressures. The optimists who had insisted upon the ultimate peacefulness of western civilization were discredited, and theories of human violence were given a new lease on life. As the Oxford pragmatist F. C. S. Schiller later remarked, the holocaust of 1914-1918 "'revealed all too clearly how ferociously unchanged beneath the thin veneer of civilization lurked the old bete humaine, and how illusory was the belief in moral progress."' 2 J. A. Cramb put the verdict of academic militarism: peace represented the death-wish of civilization, war the life-force, "'a phase in the life-effort of the State towards completer self-realization, a phase of the eternal nisus, the perpetual omni-present strife of all beings towards self- fulfilment."

Considerations drawn from the latter world are accordingly, when applied to man, not arguments but, at best, mere analogies, sometimes suggestive as indicating lines of inquiry, but never approaching the character of exact science" (p. 72).

Theodore Roosevelt and Arthur Keith put the grand view of prowar eugenics by claiming that great wars did incalcul- able service to nations in promoting national and racial unity.'4 Before we examine the response of peace biology to the challenge of the war, let us briefly review some of the wartime theories against which it had to contend. A series of physiological and psychological theories seemed to confirm that William McDougall's "instinct of pugnacity" was still deep-rooted in humanity, clearly not yet suppressed by civilized custom or the "instinct of emulation."'5 The Harvard physiologist Walter B. Cannon analyzed the visceral responses aroused by belligerent emotions of anger and rage, and endorsed the "militarist conten- tion" that the fighting instinct was firmly fixed in human nature and had served man well in the momentous struggle for existence. Developing an idea put forward by the British Fabian Graham Wallas in The Great Society (1914), Cannon suggested that "baulked disposition" due to the frustration of belligerent natural aptitudes could lead to human maladjustment and aggression.'6 George W. Crile's Mechanistic View of Peace and War - written while the author, a distinguished American surgeon, was in charge of a hospital unit at the front in 1915 - portrayed man as a physicochemical mechanism, physiologically programmed for primal combat, going to war because of strong hunting and territorial urges.'7 Henry Rutgers Marshall described man as a "fighting animal": "deeply embedded in man's nature are instincts that lead him to fight: to fight as an individual, and to fight with others of his kind in groups."

Man, "the arch-slaughterer," was a natural carnivore with combative instincts, exhibiting ferocious animal-like traits in anger and fighting. ("The untamed man, when enraged, assumes in very truth the aspect of the tiger: he puts himself in a threatening attitude, frowns, growls, or even roars.") However, man had the more sinister capacity consciously to inflict pain and exult in cruelty. Campbell anticipated Robert Ardrey's "hunting hypothesis" by emphasizing how critical to human evolution and aggression had been our ape ancestor's abandon- ment of the arboreal life for a hunting career in competition with the carnivores.'9 John T. MacCurdy theorized that warring humans still felt vestigial hostility to their foes as species other than themselves, thus anticipating Konrad Lorenz's concept of "pseudo-speciation" to explain human aggression.2" The Iowa psychologist G. T. W. Patrick explained the "insanity" of the world war as a temporary, tension-reducing reversion by man, the "fighting animal," to primeval conditions. Patrick added a Koestler-style argument about an inbuilt imbalance within humans caused by retention of "the same old brain of our fathers and forefathers, deeply stamped with ancestral traits and primitive instincts," but out of place in an advanced social system.2 1 While Malthusian theory interpreted war as the last great "positive check," the result of a swarming world population,22 crowd theory in the hands of Martin Conway and Wilfred Trotter popularized the idea of the primal pugnacity of the crowd or "herd" and anticipated Freudian notions of war as triggering a return to a more atavistic and instinctive kind of world.23 Not all of these theories presented a case for unrelieved gloom or militarism. While Patrick regarded war as normal, he evinced a 19.

Campbell deplored the waste and eugenic harm of modem war, and sought solutions through global free trade and a United States of Europe. Crile ultimately held out hope for culture against ingrained behavior patterns, and advocated a wholesale system of human conditioning against war. (So did Benjamin Kidd in The Science of Power, 1918.) 24 Cannon rejected the thesis that war was a "natural necessity" and, like McDougall and William James, searched for moral and physical substitutes for war. Marshall believed that the ideal of peace could ultimately be realized, that "the beginnings of effective control of instinctive tendencies may be found in intelligent effort to eliminate the stimuli which arouse the instinctive reaction." 25 Malthusians like Edwin D. James pinned their hopes for world peace on programs of global contraception, agricultural science, free trade, and the spread of republican government. Crowd theorists spoke of peace being imposed by a supernational "overcrowd." Trotter hoped that social sympathy and expanding rationality would prevail over the dark subconscious and instinctive forces at work in the human mass. Although the Great War dealt a body-blow to optimistic antiwar evolutionism, that tradition showed surprising resilience and a capacity to regroup. In the continuing debate that took place over the biology of war, the antiwar school beat a strategic retreat, but managed to preserve the essentials of their position. They shed some of their utopian hopes and continued to assert faith in science, reason, and the human future. They continued to claim the authority of thinkers like Novicow in support of a more sophisticated model of competitive and adaptive behavior than that presented by the militarist school. The Novicovians argued that human evolution was moving from lower levels of physiologi- cal and social struggle to higher levels of intellectual competition. They exposed the economic, moral, and biological waste of war. They held that a genuine Darwinian interpretation of social evolution placed less emphasis upon violent physical struggle than upon a broadly based competitive process that incorporated adaptive capacity, social sympathy, and cooperation. As the Belgian scholar Charles Sarolea commented: the decisive struggle for life in modern humanity is not the 24. See D. P.

CROOK external and superficial struggle of the battlefield, but the permanent and deeper struggle of the city, of the laboratory, of the workshop, of the home, of the soul, the struggle for political rights or legal rights, the struggle for religious freedom, the economic struggle for a living, or for a higher standard of living, the struggle for truth.26 Those adopting, or adapting, Novicow's ideas in wartime Britain included Peter Chalmers Mitchell, Theodore Chambers, Sir Ronald Ross, Sir Ray Lankester, James Arthur Thomson, Sir James Crichton-Browne, F. A. E. Crew, and popularizers such as Havelock Ellis, Benjamin Kidd, James Bryce, W. C. D. Whetham, and Robert Munro.7 Most of these thinkers conceded that war had played a necessary role in human evolution, but held that it was no longer central to human progress. Theodore Chambers, a liberal civic reformer and eugenicist, thought war might be justified in the cause of high ideals, but he opposed the militarist vindication of "iwars of aggression, wars for power, and wars for greed, for extension of empire or the power to impose ideals upon others." 28 Sir Ronald Ross, the conqueror of malaria, viewed war as an essential selective agency in human evolution, and even speculated that the gap between man and the next highest creature had been caused by genocide stemming from man's combative instincts. However, war had now become obsolete: "Evolution has taken to itself a number of new and finer tools, wherewith to continue its great work, and the hatchet with which it formerly rough-hewed was no longer required." 29 Havelock Ellis agreed that war had been a "formative and developmental social force of the first importance" among early men, whose warfare "being free from the awful devices due to the 26.

However, in the more complex social order of modern civilizations, war had become progressively more dangerous to both individual and community, "until it reaches such a climax of world-wide injury as we witness to-day." War inflicted a "permanent loss in the material heirlooms of Mankind and a serious injury to the spiritual traditions of civilisation." War was not the inevitable application to humankind of the law of natural selection: There are ... two capital and final objections to this view. On the one hand it is not supported by anything that Darwin himself said, and on the other hand it is denied as a fact by those authorities on natural history who speak with most knowledge. That Darwin regarded war as an insignificant or even non-existent part of natural selection must be clear to all who have read his books. He was careful to state that he used the term "struggle for existence" in a "metaphorical sense", and the dominant factors in the struggle for existence, as Darwin understood it, were natural suitability to the organic and inorganic environment and the capacity for adaptation to circumstances.30 These ecological and cooperationist themes were to become the staple of besieged antiwar biology. Distinguished British naturalists such as Ray Lankester and J. Arthur Thomson protested against the militaristic caricature of nature as a state of Hobbesian warfare. Selection, according to Lankester, was not so much a matter of direct struggle between conspecifics, but rather a more general and relentless struggle against environmental perils and the pressures of overpopulation. He demarcated predation from warfare, and denied that warfare or anything resembling it was universal in animated nature.3' Thomson opposed the reduc- 30.

Chalmers Mitchell was foremost among the knowledgeable authorities on natural history cited by Ellis (pp. 16-18). The Yale sociologist Albert G. Keller attested to the priority of violence in human selection, but he held that as culture advanced, milder forms of struggle came to predominate as being more adaptive. He suggested a gene- cultural mode of evolution, reminiscent of Dawkins's theory of memes: social variations - like physical variations in nature - were tested by circumstances, with the fitter surviving; Keller, Through War to Peace, pp. 47, 50-52, 57. 31.

Responses to environment could be "competitive or non-competitive, self-regarding or other- regarding, with teeth and claws, or with wits and kindness." Especially among the finer forms of life, adaptive behavior was more and more often "something subtler, some parental sacrifice, some co-operative device, some experiment in sociality. The improbability of war being the saving grace of human history grows upon us." He pleaded for a return to Darwin's holistic view of nature: "Darwin attached great importance to the web of life, to the manifold and subtle inter-relationships that bind creatures together in a vibrating systema Naturae." 32 The Scots clinical psychologist James Crichton-Browne also defended Darwin against Bernhardian misinterpretation, declaring that "by favoured races he meant not those that are pugnacious and destructive, but those that are best suited to their whole varied environment. ... So far was Darwin from applying to human groups the principle of the struggle for existence, as seen in plants and animals, that he condemned war and regarded it as anti- evolutionary and a sort of disease arresting healthy develop- ment." 33 The wartime debate elicited a number of criticisms of Social Darwinist methodology, including its tendency to universalize data from the area of biological science, to merge science and values, and to "&amp;reduce" humankind to nonautonomous biological units. The biologist F. A. E. Crew rejected the "biological predestina- tion" that marked the militarist-materialist concept of civilization, "the Darwinian standard of efficiency of the animal as the standard of fitness for survival of individuals and races in a civilised world."34 James Bryce, following Chalmers Mitchell, advised 32.

There was nothing in the animal world, he said, like the wars of human tribes or states. In nature it was adaptation to environment, not fighting, that was the effective factor when one species superseded another.35 Chambers objected more generally to the use made by militant Darwinists of evaluative and teleological concepts in discussions of evolution, which ought to be regarded as a natural, value-free law. Rather than attaching moral signs to whatever it was that survived, or accepting war's "biologically just" decisions, humankind should "so influence environment as to tend to give survival value to the highest and noblest characteristics." 36 Antiwar biology itself merged antireductionism with more teleological visions of human evolution. Benjamin Kidd's Science of Power (1918) typified this tendency. Although he did not share the Novicovians' faith in reason, Kidd had a similarly teleological view of humanity moving toward a higher destiny of benign competition. Ethical and mutualist modes of existence would eventuate (he said) under the influence of religion and feminism, with cultural evolution the key to a more humanitarian and peaceful future. Despite his own tendency to see biologically determined patterns in history, Kidd had become disillusioned with Social Darwinism by 1916. He blamed it for generating exploitative capitalism, imperialism, and other forms of violent reductionism.37 This theme of suspicion of Darwinism was bolstered during the war by patriotic factors, because Darwinian militarism was identified with enemy propaganda, with the evil race-"science" of the Bernhardi-Treitschke school.38 For instance, W.

CROOK Whetham, although accepting some of the tenets of the conflict school, opposed the doctrinal use of Darwinism in German propaganda to erode conduct based on Christian ethics.39 Robert Munro's anti-German tract From Darwinism to Kaiserism (1919) blamed German Weltpolitik upon false views of Darwinism, and asked what possible parallel there could be between "the almost unseen struggles and competitions" that were always in progress between animals or human tribes, and "modern warfare, with its bombs, shells, projectiles, aeroplanes, submarines, torpedoes . . .?" Only man was capable of genocide: "Natural Selection does not deal with brutality of this kind." In the usual cooperationist style, Munro predicted that control over war would come with the ascendance of social over genetic heredity, with growing altruism and rational control over environment.40 Antiwar evolutionism in Britain also gained support from the continuing strength of peace eugenics during the war. This was not so surprising, because eugenic thought generally was predisposed to condemn the haphazard selection and waste caused by war, which offended against the principle of biological planning. Historically, eugenics tended to oppose war on racist and con- servative grounds, because war threatened to annihilate a virile Anglo-Saxon stock, and was also a threat to the capitalist system, an invitation to class war and revolution. Roland Hugins remarked in 1914 that the pacifists had enlisted "the youngest of the social sciences," eugenics, to demonstrate that war had led to "cacogenic" or antieugenic selection. He deemed Jordan's Human Harvest 39. W. C. D. Whetham, The War and the Nation (London: John Murray, 1917), pp. 203-204 and chap. 5 generally. Also, idem, "The War and the Race," Quart.

Kellogg that gave an authoritative stamp to pacifist eugenics during the war. Kellogg's classic study Military Selection and Race Deterioration (1916), researched and publicized well before the war, was to dominate the field until at least the 1920s.43 His more polemical Beyond War (1912) had attacked war as biologically stupid, "utterly without shadow of serious scientific reason for its maintenance." As a zoologist, he declared: "Its like does not exist in Nature outside the forays of the few degenerate fighting ant species."44 In Military Selection Kellogg used statistics on recruitment, war mortality, disease, the physiological condition of European popu- latons (especially French recruits after 1816), and demographic change to document his expectation that "exaggerated militarism" was racially disadvantageous. Modern recruitment methods en- sured that a superior elite was removed from the population and exposed to death and disease. War also helped the spread of race- deteriorating diseases, notably venereal diseases, among civil populations.45 41. Roland Hugins, "The Eugenic Judgment of War," So. At.

P. CROOK The sickening casualties of the western from lent popular and professional credence in Britain to the prevailing Jordan-Kellogg thesis that modern war was dysgenic. It became a cliche that the cream of the nation's manhood was being heroically sacrificed in the trenches. Everybody heard of the disproportionately high casualty rates among the officer elite, of whole classes of brilliant graduates from Oxford, Cambridge, and the public schools laying down their lives for their country. The National Birth-Rate Commission in 1916 flatly reported that war was "generally admitted to exercise a selective power that is dysgenic."46 The crisis generated alarmist fears about a possible genetic catastrophe in the west. In the Galton lecture for 1916, Professor E. B. Poulton warned the Eugenics Education Society that the war threatened to carry the world backward to lower and more brutal ideals and types of men. He quoted a letter from an American scientist who felt that "We are unquestionably witnessing the most stupendously interesting step of human evolution that has occurred since that which differentiated man from the anthropoid."47 In a lively, and often ambivalent, debate in scientific and scholarly circles a number of thinkers generally accepted the "war is dysgenic" orthodoxy, although frequently qualifying it and recognizing that there were some biological justifications for war. These men included Leonard Darwin, president of the Eugenics Society; Theodore Chambers; J. Arthur Thomson; E. B. Poulton; W. C. D. Whetham; Sir Hercules Read; C. W. Saleeby; and Havelock Ellis.48 However, a significant number of critics insisted Kellogg's dealings with the German general staff and intellectual militarists at the headquarters of the German army of occupation of Belgium (he was an American representative on the Commission for the Relief of Belgium) impressed upon him the entrenched nature of Neo-Darwinist militarism within the German world- view. He was converted from pacifism to ardent support of a war that would prevent the global rule of German ideology: "The creed of the Allmacht of a natural selection based on violent and fatal competitive struggle is the gospel of the German intellectuals" (Headquarters Nights, p. 28 and chap. I). Headquarters Nights made a great impact on the American biological community (information from a reader of this journal). 46.

Macfie rated war low on the scale of factors causing dysgenic selection in modern life, compared to the ravages of industrialism, drunkenness, and congenital diseases. Transatlantic influence was exerted on the debate by thinkers such as the statistician William S. Rossiter and the eugenicist Roswell H. Johnson. Rossiter predicted revolutionary effects of the war upon Europe's reproductive patterns and social and economic life: "the ruthless hand of war may be fashioning a new age" (William S. Rossiter, "Influence of the War upon the Population," Nor. Amer. Rev., 203 [May 19161, 700-710). Harold Boag put similar views in England when he extended the concept of genetic losses to include loss of "human capital": H. Boag, "Human Capital and the Cost of War," J Roy. Statist. Soc., 79, pt. 1 (January 1916), 7-17. Roswell H. Johnson tried to set up a multifactorial model to systematize the manifold theories respecting selection by war: "Natural Selection in War," J. Hered., 6, 11 (1915), 546-548, which anticipated the more comprehensive approach he adopted in collaboration with Paul Popenoe in the popular textbook Applied Eugenics (New York: Macmillan, 1918), chap. 16. Johnson, a member of the American Breeder's Association eugenics section (usually characterized as illiberal and racist), considered World War I to be highly dysgenic as it decimated the superior Teutonic amd Hebrew races.

CROOK MITCHELL'S VIEWS It is in this context that I propose to consider the ideas of Peter Chalmers Mitchell, a distinguished zoologist and civilized Scot, whose Evolution and the War (1915) constituted one of the more intelligent restatements of the "optimist" tradition on the biology of war. After a youthful fling with biological militarism, he became a stout opponent of hereditarianism and deterministic laws derived from animal origins. The science of animal behavior, he argued, did not warrant extended generalization to human behavior; nor did the divisive state of Darwinism provide a viable basis for applying selection theory to man. Unusually among biologists, he advanced the concept of scientific uncertainty, arising out of the "new physics" of the late nineteenth century, to attack extrapolation from nature to man. An infusion of idealist metaphysics added an edge to his suspicion of mechanistic and reductionist militarist doctrines. Chalmers Mitchell (1864-1945) was an impressively cosmo- politan thinker, educated at the universities of Aberdeen, Oxford, Berlin, and Leipzig. By 1915 he had written books on biology (including Outlines of Biology, 1894), a biography of T. H. Huxley, and a best-seller, The Childhood of Animals (1912). An examiner in biology to the Royal College of Physicians (1892-1896, 1901-1903) and Secretary to the Zoological Society of London (1903-1935), Mitchell was active in journalism, writing popular science for a range of journals and newspapers, most abundantly for the Saturday Review under the editorship of Max Harris. During the war Mitchell was recruited to the War Office as a captain in military intelligence (MI7) and worked for the Imperial General Staff and the War Mission. His intelligence work focused on propaganda for distribution on the German fronts. In 1918 he acted as War Office liaison officer to Lord Northcliffe, appointed by Lloyd George to be director of propaganda in enemy countries. Mitchell was awarded a CBE in 1918 and a knighthood in 1 929. ' 51. At M17 Mitchell was in charge of the distribution of propaganda for military zones, a job he kept until the end of the war. As part of the Crewe House propaganda team assembled by Northcliffe under Henry Wickham Steed and Campbell Stuart, Mitchell had a hand in drafting and publicizing the British peace terms. It is possible, although I have seen no evidence to this effect, that Mitchell may have distributed his book as propaganda; however, he was mainly concerned with the massive air distribution of leaflets, and his book was probably too cerebral to meet War Office and Crewe House objectives of undermining morale or appealing to restive minorities or oppressed nationalities in the German and Austrian empires. See P. Chalmers Mitchell, My Fill of Days (London: Faber and Faber, 1937), pp. 293-298; Sir Campbell Stuart. S5ecrets of</page><page sequence="19">Peter Chalmers Mitchell and Antiwar Evolutionism 343 Intellectually, Mitchell was torn between the British empirical tradition and German idealism. Describing himself as a "hard-shell Darwinian evolutionist, a lover of the scalpel and microscope," who disliked all forms of supernaturalism, he admitted to a love- hate relationship with Hegelianism and was fascinated by issues such as vitalism in biology. As a raw twenty-year-old graduate from Aberdeen, he spent some months in Berlin at a time of militarist fervor, orchestrated by Bismarck, and found this deeply disagreeable. However, he liked German hospitality, and he liked Hegel: "Schopenhauer had bored me, and Kant had beaten me, but the shining, fragile net thrown by Hegel over the universe had enchanted me." As a brilliant Oxford zoologist Mitchell absorbed German zoology, visited German universities, and came to know many German scientists - but his intellect and heart turned steadily to France. He read French (and Russian) literature incessantly: Balzac, Gautier, Flaubert, Zola, Maupassant, de l'Isle- Adam, Huysmans, and others. This "amazing literature of beauty and insight" he placed above German literature and "far above dyes and drugs and all the material progress of Germany." 52 In a Saturday Review article of 1896, Mitchell ingeniously put the view that Germany rather than France was Britain's rival "in the biological sense." This was apocalyptic science in the style of H. G. Wells. Mitchell spoke of nations as "species in the making" and forecast an era of world wars fought between expanding giants, with feeble races wiped off the earth. The arsenals of war, armies and navies, were like the teeth and claws of the tiger, the weapons of the "species-corporate." As conflict was most deadly in nature between species most similar, and most expansive Crewe House (London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1920); Henry Wickham Steed, Through Thirty Years: 1892-1922 (London: Heinemann, 1924), 11, 221, 224, 242, 244-246; M. L. Sanders and P. M. Taylor, British Propaganda during the First World War, 1914-18 (London: Macmillan, 1982). Mitchell wrote the article on propaganda for the 12th ed. of the Encyclopaedia Britannica (he had been superintending editor for biology, paleontology, and zoology for the 11th ed.). Mitchell was a Liberal in 1919, and even considered standing for Parliament, but he became disillusioned by Lloyd George's vindictive peace policy and his views moved to the left. He sympathized with the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War. He was living in Malaga at the outbreak of the war and "as a passionate 'Red"' fraternized with the anarcho-syndicalists (My Fill of Days, pp. 264, 383). 52. Mitchell, Evolution and the War, pp. x, xxi, 107; also his reminiscences, My Fill of Days, esp. chaps. 3, 6. After reading Russian for technical purposes, he was led to Russian literature - to Pushkin, Lermontov, Gogol, Dostoevsky, and, of course, Tolstoy, whose ideas may have pushed Mitchell toward pacifism. He wrote Materialism and Vitalism in Biology (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1930), warning against the rash interpretation of idealism and vitalism by social prophets and politicians.</page><page sequence="20">344 D. P. CROOK territorially, Germany was likely to be England's natural rival. France and England were "commensal mates"; Russia was a huge protoplasmic mass, ready to absorb invaders but lacking organisa- tion for external aggression; China and Japan were too distinct from the West to threaten a present danger. The smaller nations were "an assortment of incongruous breeds, imperfectly trained to live together in a harmony that requires the utmost vigilance of the keepers" (an interesting foretaste of Desmond Morris's metaphor of the "human zoo"). According to Mitchell, the "first great racial struggle of the future" would be between the Anglo-Saxon conspecifics, England and Germany. The next would be between the victor and America, which was becoming expansive and would challenge for world supremacy when its population exceeded natural biological limits. Although the article drew little attention in Britain, it caused ripples in Germany where von Bulow saw it as a sign that the British were shaping up for an inevitable war against an emerging naval rival.53 Mitchell soon forgot his morbid prophecies of war. He visited Germany in 1911, 1912, and 1913, but anticipated no trouble. Like others he was convinced that "war between great modern nations was a horror that no statesman would face." His ideas had in fact changed notably by 1914. He had read Tolstoy, and opposed the Boer War. He had come to reject Bernhardian militarism, playing down the role of struggle in natural selection and denying that man as an ethical creature was subject to biological laws governing the life of lower animals. He delivered three lectures along these lines to the Royal Institution in February 1915. They provided the basis for his Evolution and the War.54 Mitchell lived in the age of Ernst Mach, Henri Poincare and Albert Einstein, F. H. Bradley and Alfred Whitehead - men whose scientific philosophies had demolished the old Newtonian cer- tainties and sown widespread doubt that scientific laws expressed an objective knowledge of reality. Scientific laws were constructs, hypotheses about a world that was, in Bradley's phrase, a structure 53. P. Chalmers Mitchell, "A Biological View of Our Foreign Policy", Saturday Rev., 82, 210 (February 1, 1896), 118-120, in which he wrote: "Were every German to be wiped out tomorrow, there is no English trade, no English pursuit that would not immediately expand. Were every Englishman to be wiped out tomorrow, the Germans would gain in proportion." This was the sort of "illusion" that Norman Angell set out to dispel. Bernard Shaw noted the article with alarm; he went to see Frank Harris, the editor of the .Saturday Review, and when Harris denied writing it, retorted that it was equally harmful whether written by Harris or the office boy (Mitchell, My Fill of Days, p. 65). 54. Mitchell, Evolution and the War, p. xxv.</page><page sequence="21">Peter Chalmers Mitchell and Antiwar Evolutionism 345 of emergent relationships. Mitchell absorbed the epistemological misgivings arising out of the "new physics," and with some originality applied them in the biological world to enhance the "restrictionist" approach. He expressed skepticism that any signifi- cant implications for humans could be drawn from so-called Darwinian science. He argued that a scientific law had no absolute validity, that it was a generalization from acquired experience: a scientific law is the result of the interplay of two factors, the extended world, at once the occasion and the subject of experience, and the human mind, ranging over the extended world, codifying, simplifying, schematizing. The resulting law is of the human mind and in the human mind, rather than of the extended world or in the extended world. It is an attempt at comprehension, subjective and not objective. In a curious melding of "new physics" with idealist metaphysics (reminiscent of Mach's epistemology), Mitchell denied that science was capable of ever understanding the "ultimate, metaphysical reality which enfolds and permeates us." He accepted Kant's view that science was theoretical and that one must look to a source other than science for the rules of conduct. This was the basic fallacy of the militant Social Darwinists, that they extrapolated from a biological "law" such as the "struggle for existence" to human rules of conduct.55 In any case, Mitchell asked, had biological science in fact established satisfactory laws governing animal and human behav- ior? He was much concerned by the war of paradigms that had accompanied the genetics revolution of the late nineteenth century, when older traditions of natural history and orthodox Darwinian theory came under siege from new ideas, when Mendelism, biometrics, and revived Lamarckism vied for suprem- acy within the world of biology.56 Even though, as a zoologist, Mitchell believed that natural selection was the best hypothesis of the cause of organic evolution, he insisted that there was too much disagreement about its credibility among naturalists for it yet to be regarded as scientific law. He cited Huxley's opinion that natural selection was "an illuminating and admirable hypothesis" rather than a proved theory. Acute debate was taking place between 55. Ibid., pp. 6-7. 56. See Peter J. Bowler, The Eclipse of Darwinism: Anti-Darwinian Evolu- tionary Theories in the Decades around 1900 (Baltimore, London: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1983), chap. I and passim.</page><page sequence="22">346 D. P. CROOK orthodox Darwinists, focusing on small, continuous variations as the key to selection, and Mendelians, emphasizing the importance of large and discontinuous fluctuations: "many of the most ardent Mendelians have such confidence in their own theory that they no longer think it necessary to invoke the operation of natural selection at all." Another school of zoology believed in directive rather than natural selection. Given these schisms, it was "merely ludicrous to suggest that natural selection and the struggle for existence have any claims to be regarded as scientific law"; natural selection was not a law but a "hypothesis much in debate." I Having made these warnings, Mitchell then reinforced mainline peace biology. Professionally aware of the range of Darwin's ideas, he argued that there had been a great deal of misinterpretation of the concept of "struggle for existence": Darwin's survivors, the 'Yavoured races" in the struggle for life, were not meant to be the best armed necessarily, but rather the best suited to their whole environment "including climate, food-supply, chances of mating and leaving offspring, general adaptation to their place in the composite web of life." Too often people forgot that Darwin emphasized that he used the term "struggle for existence" in a "large and metaphorical sense, including the dependence of one being on another." 58 Like P. A. Kropotkin, Mitchell asserted the importance of cooperative behavior, mutual aid, as a factor in evolution. It was rare for separate species to war against one another. Each had its niche in the ecological scheme, and there was rarely a direct struggle to take over an environment. Species tended to live side by side, the main competition being between individuals of the same species to survive in the face of severe Malthusian pressures. Nature produced an immense oversupply of young in most species, with a resultant competition for food, air, water, and living space. The better adapted tended to survive longer and leave more offspring. Often it was the more intelligent, hardier, and more adaptable that displaced the more aggressive and better-armed creatures from an environment. This was the case, for example, in the displacement of the fierce Tasmanian wolf (thylacine) by the dingo, with its larger brain and greater resistance to disease. 57.

It was only when the "poets and popular writers got to work, that the struggle for existence acquired the special significance of fierceness and cruelty, became an expression of nature 'red in tooth and claw"' (p. 22). 59.

He publicized the researches undertaken by Victor Shelford, zoologist at the University of Chicago, whose team for years surveyed the life-systems of all animals, large and small, at field stations within one hundred miles of Chicago, concentrating on the Indiana sand dunes around Lake Michigan. Mitchell was impressed by Shelford's "patient and exact study of nature of a kind that would have delighted Darwin." Shelford's contribution was to put violence and struggle into place in the larger web of life: "He expects to find nature 'cruel and heartless'; he admits that 'to die to become the food of another organism is the fate of the vast majority of animals."' Yet Mitchell believed Shelford's results to be compatible with his own theory that evolutionary success depended less upon active violence done by dominant to weaker species, than upon general adaptive capacity. Shelford's team had found that the animals of any region formed communities, consisting of a number of species that had selected a particular environmental complex: different groups formed stream, pond, lake, prairie, thicket, and forest communities. The investi- gators reported a finely balanced system of interdependence and unconscious cooperation. The dominant factors in successful struggle were a natural suitability to environment and a capacity to adapt behavior to circumstances. They found no trace of the remotest resemblance to human warfare. Popularizers such as Havelock Ellis were soon passing on this version of Shelford's work to the British public.6" to which the brown rat was better suited. Cockroaches had achieved success because of their ability to adapt to widely varying environments, including human environments; there was no evidence that members of different cockroach species attacked one another: "there is nothing even remotely comparable with the interpretation of the struggle for existence as war" (Evolution and the War, pp. 27-34). Even amongst the social insects, such as bees, wasps, and termites, although there was fighting in defense of the hive or nest, or in raids for food, there was nothing in the form of direct warfare between communities. Ray Lankester had suggested to Mitchell that a closer analogy might be drawn between nations and communities of social insects, than between nations and species (ibid., pp. 37-38). Havelock Ellis propagated Mitchell's views in "Evolu- tion and War" (above, n. 30), chap. 2: Mitchell had shown that "even the most widely current notions of the extermination of one species by another have no foundation in fact" (p. 17). 60. Ellis, "Evolution and War," pp. 34-36. Mitchell may have played down the central role of struggle in Shelford's work. Shelford concluded that the vital sequences of plant and animal succession depended upon "negative mechanisms - the war of all against all, and the self-elimination of species from their own habitat": J. R. Engel, Sacred Sands: The Struggle for Community in the Indiana Dunes (Middletown, Conn.: Wesleyan University Press, 1983), p. 171, and</page><page sequence="24">348 D. P. CROOK In his book Mitchell distinguished between animal predation and human warfare: "The strength and ferocity so frequently displayed in the animal kingdom, the restless pursuit of their prey by hungry animals, the use of offensive weapons such as beak and claws, horns and teeth, are frequently used as analogies for the activities and weapons of human warfare. But the comparison does not bear close examination." Animals were ferocious, or used their weapons, to obtain food - or else only in defence of themselves, their mates and young, or in the rivalries of sex. Mitchell did not consider that human war may have been waged for extensions of such reasons. The point he did make was that violence and struggle had been exaggerated as key factors in animal evolution: "I could adduce from the writings of Darwin himself, and from those of later naturalists, a thousand instances taken from the animal kingdom in which success has come about by means analogous with the cultivation of all the peaceful arts, the raising of the intelligence, and the heightening of the emotions of love and pity."61 In any case, could "laws" derived from animal behavior be applied to humans? Mitchell had doubts about the units under discussion. The units of the animal kingdom - species, subspecies, varieties, races - were connected by blood relationship, linked by common descent. The units of human populations - or at least those favored by militant Social Darwinists in their zoological analogies - were nations, and nations were now known not to be of the same order as units in the animal and vegetable world; they were not united by blood relationship. Following the anthropologi- cal theories of the American William Z. Ripley (The Races of generally pp. 168-172 (the phrase is Engel's). Shelford quoted from Theodore Roosevelt a long passage depicting the "hideous horror" of the everyday life of wild creatures and preliterate man: V. E. Shelford, Animal Communities in Temperate America (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1913), p. 7; and Engel, Sacred Sands, p. 171. Shelford was in a similar tradition to pioneer ecologist Frederick Clements who was influenced by Spencer's organismic philosophy, whereas most members of the Dunes movement were cooperationists in the tradition of another pioneer in animal ecology, Henry Chandler Cowles. According to Engel, Cowles was influenced by analogies between plant commu- nities undergoing change and human communities undergoing social evolution and reform: "The engine of progress was not so much competition between individuals as experiments by pioneering associations of organisms ... in more adaptive reciprocal relationships with one another and their environment. Behind his thought lay the experimental social, democratic paradigm of the Chicago pragmatists" (Engel, Sacred Sands, pp. 148-149, 172). 1 am indebted to one of this journal's readers for drawing my attention to these sources. 61. Mitchell, Evolution and the War, p. 41.</page><page sequence="25">Peter Chalmers Mitchell and Antiwar Evolutionism 349 Europe, London, 1899), Mitchell distinguished three racial types among the white population of modern Europe: long-headed (dolichocephalic), tall, blond Nordics (or Teutonics); round- headed (brachycephalic), stocky, intermediately colored Alpines (or Celts); and longish-headed, short, dark Mediterraneans. Anthropological studies had shown that these types were inter- mingled in Europe, despite concentrations in certain areas. Britain was Mediterranean and Nordic with an absorbed Alpine element. France had the three races in well-marked forms. Russia was typically Alpine, with Nordic strains in the northwest. Germany despite the pan-Germanists - was diverse, with predominantly Alpine types in the south, center, and east, Nordic only along the northwest. Clearly Europe's political divisions did not correspond to the racial types of their inhabitants. Even if the struggle for existence were the law of life, it did not necessarily apply to political units that were the products, not of common descent or genetic links, but of "bonds that are peculiar to the human race." By this he meant essentially cultural bonds.62 Cultural evolution, Mitchell argued, had become the charac- teristic means of human development, and this set human history apart from all other natural history. Of course, it was not possible completely to disentangle hereditary from environmental factors in the shaping of individuals or peoples: "moulding of the stock and moulding of the individual act and react one on the other."63 But on the whole he was skeptical that wholesale genetic modification of human stocks took place as a result of supposedly selective agencies. This applied to war. On the eugenics of war, Mitchell was unconvinced that any systematic effects could be demonstrated, and found the evidence to be vague and conflicting. While many of the bravest were likely to perish in war, many who were aggressive and martial were also likely to disappear: "If this consideration be pursued on theoretical lines, the inference might be drawn that forty years of unbroken peace have made Germany too ready to embark on war, as there has been no opportunity for her fire- eaters to be eliminated." On this issue Mitchell was out of step with conventional eugenic thought, which, as we have seen, was predisposed to condemn the haphazard selection and waste caused by war. Mitchell, however, was very wary of the "clamorous pretensions" of the Mendelians, who were prominent in eugenics. There was an element of sociopolitical suspicion in his attitude to 62. Ibid., p. 64. 63. Ibid.,pp.70-71.</page><page sequence="26">350 D. P. CROOK the Mendelians. They were too ready to find hereditarian causes for social diseases, to ignore the predominance of nurture over nature in determining the character of a people or culture, and thus to delimit the scope for reformist social programming.64 Mitchell described himself as an "epigenesist" in the long- standing biological debate between "ipreformationists" and "(epi- genesists." The former believed that organisms unfolded from a tiny preprogrammed precursor, the latter that the key influence was environment acting upon the germ to form the mature creature. Mitchell applied epigenesis to nations. The most impor- tant forces molding difference in nationality were, he said, epigenetic - that is to say, that they were cultural forces imposed upon the hereditary material, and had to be reimposed in each generation. Despite Weismann's demonstration of the role of the germplasm in handing on traits from generation to generation, and its relative immunity from environmental influences, scientists were now aware that environment played a key role in determining the final result of the evolutionary human process.65 With nations (Mitchell argued), this meant that education, social conditions, and value-systems acted upon the basic genetic material to shape the mental and emotional qualities of a people. Physical change caused by selection in humans was slow and imperceptible - but the result of the environment on the mind was critical in forming attitudes. Such attitudes were transmitted to the next generation, not directly by inheritance, but by cultural acquisition via tradition and literature. Literature was a "'new organ of a nation," transcending individual life, shaped and growing from generation to generation, forming a "permanent mental environment of the most powerful kind."' It was an organ of Kultur, giving a continuous life to national ideals, emotions, political and social systems, concepts of justice, and religion. This served to differentiate nations, however alike their initial racial composition, in a fashion that was new and peculiar to man.66 64. Ibid., pp. 70-83. Against pacifist eugenicists such as Jordan, Mitchell suggested that after a war, returned heroes were attractive to women, and this was likely to result in "high and selective reproductive activity" (ibid., p. 78). Also, orphans of the killed were well provided for by the state. G. G. Coulton cited his arguments against Jordan and Angell in Main Illusions of Pacificism, pp. 112-113. Mitchell was critical of William Bateson's suggestion, made to the Australian section of the British Association, that mental and emotional aptitudes and qualities were genetically determined (Evolution and the War, p. 79); he said flatly that "nurture is inconceivably more important than nature" (p. 82). 65. Mitchell made an earlier statement of this case in P. Chalmers Mitchell, "The Making of Modern Races," Nor. Amer. Rev., 179 (July 1904), 526-542. 66. Mitchell, Evolution and the War, p. 90.</page><page sequence="27">Peter Chalmers Mitchell and Antiwar Evolutionism 351 Although man was physiologically a slightly modified ape, he had during eons of human evolution acquired a consciousness that had no parallel in the animal or vegetable world: And it is consciousness that transforms all the qualities and faculties acquired by human beings from the animal world and that is the foundation of free and intelligent existence. It is not the existence of alternatives, not unforeseeability or spontaneity but the consciousness of these that puts man and the nations he makes above the laws of the unconscious world. It is conscious- ness that gives man the power of being at once the actor, the spectator and the critic, that enables him to distinguish between self and not-self; and that brings with it the sense of responsi- bility and of reality.6" Man was not, therefore, bound by supposedly deterministic laws derived from animal analogies. Mitchell was sarcastic about the current obsession with man's animal origins: "Since Charles Darwin convinced the world that man came into existence by descent from lower animals, zoological analogies are presented to us not as literature but as scientific fact." As the augurs of imperial Rome inspected the entrails of animals before giving advice on grave matters of state, so "modern philosophers explain and justify human conduct after a visit to the monkey-house at the Zoological Gardens." The pseudoscientists went to the insects to explain human social organization. They explained man's ferocity by reference to the ape and the tiger. "Human nature is interpreted in terms of protoplasm."68 Mitchell foreshadowed some modern methodological objec- tions to the use of analogy. Unlike certain sociobiologists, he advised extreme caution in making comparisons between different species, and especially between man and the lower animals: It is merely futile to range up and down the animal kingdom, picking a resemblance here and a resemblance there; only the tracing back of human qualities down the exact line of ancestry of man, whatever that may be, could help us, and even were that done, no doctrine of origin, nor proved fact of origin could obliterate the distinctions between man and beast. However fruitful and interesting it may be to remember that we are rooted deep in the natal mud, our possession of consciousness 67. Ibid., p. 105. 68. Ibid., pp. 1, 93.</page><page sequence="28">352 D. P. CROOK and the sense of freedom is a vital and overmastering distinc- tion.69 On the other hand, Mitchell was even more sarcastic about another extreme, that of the vitalists - especially the followers of Henri Bergson, who suffused all life with a sense of consciousness, purpose, and freedom. That only blurred the real distinction between man and animals. Mitchell wanted to demonstrate that man was unique, not according to traditional philosophy or religion, but according to Darwinian law. He held with Darwin that the moral, intellectual, and emotional qualities of man had evolved from the qualities of animals. Nevertheless, animals were on the whole instinctive, man intelligent; animals irresponsible, man responsible; animals automata, man free. There was no need to postulate an innate moral law within human nature, as did the Kantians. Writing as a "hard-shell Darwinist," Mitchell concluded: I assert as a biological fact that the moral law is as real and as external to man as the starry vault. It has no secure seat in any single man or in any single nation. It is the work of the blood and tears of long generations of men. It is not in man, inborn or innate, but is enshrined in his traditions, in his customs, in his literature, and his religion. Its creation and sustenance are the crowning glory of man, and his consciousness of it puts him in a high place above the animal world.70 It followed that humans could create peace, if they wanted. War was not fated. Evolution and the War ran through two printings and was translated into French and Portuguese.7' It obtained a generally favorable reception in wartime Britain, although it never became broadly popular. Havelock Ellis and Sir James Crichton-Browne used Mitchell's authority to show that struggle against environ- ment, and capacity to adapt to it, were more important than fighting in the evolutionary process. Crichton-Browne, a friend of Mitchell's, praised his "admirable and opportune lecture" in Bernhardi and Creation (1916), which cited Mitchell's ecological 69. Ibid., p. 94. Cf. S. A.

G. Coulton's Main Illusions of Pacificism (1916) used Mitchell's skepticism about the methodology of peace eugenics to discredit the Jordan-Angell thesis that war was dysgenic.74 The reviews, generally good, praised Mitchell's scholarly contribution to the war effort. The Sociological Review recom- mended the book to the reader "who wishes to know how the philosophic biologist meets the militarist perversion of the Darwinian hypothesis." The New Statesman judged Mitchell's cool scientific dissection of Friedrich von Bernhardi's doctrine to be "far more damaging to the enemy than all the thick volumes of denunciation issuing from the printing presses." The reviews also indicated the contentiousness of the issues raised. The Saturday Review commended Mitchell's clarity and maturity, but accused him of drifting into the "danger-zone of pacifism" under the influence of dreamers like Tolstoy. Nature, although respectful, felt that Mitchell had underestimated hereditary factors: "when the author expresses his belief that 'nurture is inconceivably more important than nature', he is opposing complementary, not antithetic, factors." 75 Nor did Mitchell's "restrictionist" views escape censure. Sir Ronald Ross, editor of Science Progress, warmly recommended the work of "a genuine man of science. ... In this book we find none of the hypotheses converted into dogmas and fancies converted into facts which disfigure the works, not only of the pseudo-philosophers but even of those who claim the rank of men of science." However, Ross was more confident than Mitchell about the reliability of Darwinian theory, disputed his distinction between law and hypothesis, and was more inclined to think that 72.

The reviewer in the Saturday Review argued that Germany's aggressive policy preceded Bernhardian Darwinism and was really based on the "cruel and predatory tactics" of universal industrialism; Mitchell "passes over in silence" the main questions in the psychology and politics of peace and war.</page><page sequence="30">354 D. P. CROOK laws derived from animal behavior might legitimately be applied to humans.76 The Times Literary Supplement was more sympathetic towards Mitchell: "German 'biological necessity' is seen to be based not on a law but on a very questionable hypothesis conceming Nature, and to be linked with that hypothesis not by relation but by analogy - and a false analogy." The reviewer commended Mitchell's premise that the "law of struggle" in nature, even if established, would be no evidence that a similar "law" must govern civilized humanity: "He is constrained once again to defend Darwin against the Darwinians, and in the process shows that the whole study of natural selection has been divergent from the crude conception of natural war." 77 When Mitchell's book was translated into French and published with a preface by Etmile Boutroux, academician and philosopher of science, it again attracted approval for its critique of German doctrines of omnipotent force, while similarly generating theo- retical debate among French biologists. The Sorbonne biologist J?tienne Rabaud hailed Mitchell for expressing "the essential fact that absolute force is not dominant in biologic phenomena," but he refused to accept that man differed so radically from animals as to make analogies illegitimate: "To endeavor to separate, from the metaphysical and sentimental point of view, organisms that one is obliged to assimilate from the biologic point of view, is a rather vain undertaking." However, another eminent biologist, Joseph Grasset of the medical faculty of the University of Montpellier, sided with Mitchell. He declared that man, as a fixed species for many centuries, presented characteristics so specific - notably from the "psychical point of view" - that he should rationally be made the subject of a separate science, human biology: "The human biologist must guard himself as carefully against the amibomorphic error as the general biologist guards himself against the anthropomorphic error." This antireductionism was combined with traditional peace evolutionism, even in war-torn France, when Grasset agreed with Mitchell that it is not the general biologic law of struggle, battle, the victory of the strong, which should be applied to man; it is the law of progress, mutual love and help, collaboration and emulation. ....

He questioned the conflict paradigm that underpinned biological militarism, and reinforced a holistic and more peaceful model of nature by reference to the emerging discipline of ecology. His "restrictionist" objections to the deterministic tendencies of much prevailing biosocial thought combined philosophical with biological arguments to assert that human history was sui generis, based upon the unique development of human consciousness and the cultural transmission of knowledge. Mitchell's opposition to biological militarism reflected Victorian anxieties about the legitimacy of evolutionary ethics. However, he introduced an innovatory note, linked to the "modernist" intellectual milieu of the time, when he put objections to the use of analogy on the grounds (1) that the Darwinist paradigm had not been properly established, and (2) that scientific laws themselves were uncertain and subjective. The first objection related to the bitter controversies that racked the biological world in the 1900s when mutation theory thrust the Darwinian concept of natural selection into temporary disrepute. In this respect Mitchell encoutered continuing Darwinist orthodoxy, not least from peace biology itself, while confusion was added by his personal devotion to Darwinism and his sociopoliti- cal suspicion of Mendelian hereditarianism. The later triumph of a new Darwinian synthesis under men like R. A. Fisher made Mitchell's criticisms seem outmoded. In the second respect, Mitchell's attack on the primacy of naturalistic science echoed the epistemology of the "new physics" and movements such as German neo-Kantianism. However, positivism was still deeply embedded in Britain, indeed enjoying a resurgence from the last decade of the nineteenth century.79 Mitchell's critique of the 78. P.

CROOK Darwinist version of it seems to have been too novel and puzzling to influence a generation still convinced of the soundness of the science. Mitchell made more impact when he put his objections to the use of analogy on the grounds of professional methodology. As a naturalist, he could argue: It is impossible to make correct comparisons even between an insect and spider, two creatures so closely allied that only zoologists would separate them, unless we could trace the qualities of the insect and of the spider respectively down to their common ancestor, and in so doing we should almost certainly lose all that made the comparison interesting and significant, and be left with little more than the qualities common to all protoplasm. ... It is quite true that the whole web of life is in physical and physiological community, but considerations drawn from any part of it require so much modification before they can be applied to any other part, that they become merely verbal.80 This type of criticism was to have a more lasting heritage. Chalmers Mitchell is worth remembering as an articulate early spokesman of a persistent, if often embattled, modern tradition that has resisted interpretations of human nature and history based upon genetic determinants or immutable biological laws, or upon the use of animal analogies to generalize too freely about human aggression and war.

Paradoxically, the revival of positivism was also associated with the growth and prestige of physics, if Mackenzie's theory is right - for positivism flourished with the rise of a scientific methodology that "stressed fact-finding and . . . devalued theory" (p. 336). 80.
