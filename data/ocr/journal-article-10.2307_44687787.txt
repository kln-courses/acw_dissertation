Although it has been demonstrated that seat belt use is highly effective in preventing occupant ejections, it has been argued that occupant containment during rollover can be accomplished with the use of laminated side glazing. This study was conducted to evaluate the retention characteristics of production laminated side windows. The current vehicle fleet was surveyed for vehicles equipped with production laminated side glass. The survey examined relevant window system parameters including glass retention system, glass configuration, and window geometry. A representative subset of five front door systems from several manufacturers was chosen for further evaluation. In addition, one legacy rear door system with laminated glass was included for comparison. Drop tests were conducted on the production component door-glass systems utilizing an 18 kg (40 lb) headform at an impact speed of 24 km/h (15 mph). None of the tested window systems retained the headform under these loading conditions. Given the results of this study, together with the NHTSA's previous measurements of occupant effective mass, it is concluded that production laminated side glass is not an effective barrier to occupant ejection during rollover. INTRODUCTION In recent years, the auto industry has seen a growth in the use of heat-strengthened trilaminate glass in side window applications for passenger vehicles. The stated purpose by the OEM manufacturers and suppliers of these products include solar energy and UV light control, sound reduction, theft deterrence and weight reduction. With regards to annealed trilaminate glazing, it has been proposed by some that its use in side windows can improve occupant retention rates during rollover (Sanees, et al., 2001). However, a survey of the literature reveals that to-date there are no published rollover research studies that have evaluated the retention characteristics of heat-strengthened trilaminate glass installed in production door-window systems. Trilaminate side window glass is constructed of two panes of heat-strengthened glass bonded to an interlayer of polyvinyl butyral (PVB). Heat-strengthened glass has strength properties that fall between tempered and annealed glass and it can be manufactured at lower thicknesses than fully tempered glass (Esposito, 1999; Willke, et al., 1999). The combination of strength and reduced thickness permits heat-strengthened glass to be manufactured into a trilaminate having the same thicknesses as tempered glass, which provides automotive manufacturers the option of using either tempered or laminated glass in side windows without modification of the production automotive door components. At a given overall thickness, the trilaminate glazing offers superior acoustic properties in terms of noise attenuation (Esposito and Freeman, 2002). Review of the literature indicates that very little objective testing has been performed on heat-strengthened trilaminate glass in production side door-window systems. In the NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) sponsored work, Atelsek et al. (1995) conducted guided impactor testing on chemically tempered trilaminate glazing; however, test evaluations of this material were performed in a laboratory fixture with the test window rigidly clamped into a large metal frame. Willke, et al. (1999) applied the same guided impactor protocol to prototype heat-strengthened trilaminate, but the side windows tested were installed in heavily modified prototype door-window systems. Sanees, et al. (2002a, 2002b, 2003a, 2003b) performed testing on some production door-window systems; however, the glazing evaluated was composed of annealed trilaminate and the protocol differed substantively from that applied in the earlier NHTSA sponsored research. Esposito (1999) discussed the performance of heat-strengthened trilaminate, but this work focused on theft deterrence and glazing resistance to efforts to gain entry into the compartment. Only Kramer, et al. (2006) has evaluated heat-strengthened trilaminate in a production door-window assembly. This 193</page><page sequence="2">work demonstrated that heat-strengthened trilaminate fractured due to vehicle deformation has retention capacity comparable to tempered glass. In fact, the vast majority of prior published tests have focused on the performance of materials other than heat strengthened trilaminate glazing, including annealed trilaminate glass (Sanees et al., 2002a, 2002b, 2003; Moran et al., 1995; Atelsek et al., 1995), glass-plastic (Clark et al., 1984, 1989; Peterson et al., 1989; Moran et al., 1995; Atelsek et al., 1995; Willke et al., 1999), and polycarbonate (Miller and Sykes, 1998; Sykes and Miller, 1998). These materials have significantly different characteristics from the heat-strengthened trilaminate glass used in today's production vehicles. The objective of this study was to evaluate the retention characteristics of the heat-strengthened trilaminate side window glass used in current production vehicles. A series of drop tests were conducted on production component door-glass systems utilizing an 18 kg (40 lb) headform at an impact speed of 24 km/h (15 mph). This impact speed represents 77 percent of the maximum rollover occupant-to-glazing relative velocity (31 .3 km/h), as determined by the NHTSA's film analysis (Atelsek et al., 1995). It also represents 80 percent of the most frequent occupant-to-glazing contact speed (30 km/h) associated with glazing fracture in side impacts (Atelsek et al., 1995). The test protocol used in this study is substantially similar to the procedure utilized by the NHTSA in their prior retention evaluation (Atelsek, et al., 1995; Willke, et al., 1999; Willke, et al., 2001). However, in the present test setup, the fixture supporting the door- glass system was designed to replicate the configuration and attachment points found in the current production vehicle environment (i.e. the door was supported only at the forward hinges and door latch assembly, with no other modifications made to the door frame or glass retention systems). Furthermore, the 18 kg (40 lb) headform was dropped vertically onto the glass, rather than using a guided impactor as done by the NHTSA. This drop-test setup was adopted to more accurately replicate the occupant-loading scenario found in a rollover environment, where centripetal accelerations (most often in excess of 1 g) act on the vehicle and occupant during and after the contact event. In addition, a drop test was conducted on one legacy laminated door-glass system utilized in the late 1980's and early 1990's. Observations were made regarding the retention capability of the trilaminate glass, as well as the glass failure mechanics. These observations are discussed in the context of prior work regarding trilaminate side glazing. METHODS LAMINATED GLAZING SURVEY An evaluation of 2006 model year passenger vehicles sold in the United States was conducted to identify vehicles in which laminated side windows were available either standard or as optional equipment; thirty-five vehicle models from 16 vehicle manufacturers were identified with this laminated side glass option. A survey was conducted of this passenger vehicle subset to better quantify the laminated side window glass in current production vehicles. As part of the survey, the window systems were photographed, and geometric characteristics of the window, seal, and window attachment system were measured. These included the glass construction and overall thickness; overall perimeter dimensions; and seal overlap at the front, top, and rear of the windows. The vehicles surveyed represent over 90% of the total volume sales of 2006 model year passenger vehicle models with laminated side glass. The surveyed vehicles included trilaminate side glass manufactured by multiple glass suppliers including PPG, Pilkington, Saint Gobain, Guardian, Vitro, and Carlite. The glass thickness utilized ranged from 3.1 mm (0.122 in) to 5.0 mm (0.197 in); and overlap of the seal along the window edge ranged from 7.9 mm (0.31 in) to 38.9 mm (1.53 in). Complete glazing survey results can be found in Table 1 (Appendix A). Based upon the survey of the 2006 side window vehicle applications, five door systems were identified for testing to obtain a cross-section of the surveyed glass dimensions, suppliers, and retention geometries. These door systems include the Jeep Grand Cherokee, Chrysler Pacifica, Lincoln Aviator, Chevrolet Trailblazer and Volvo S60. In addition, the Chevrolet Suburban was included as a legacy system. The trilaminate side glass in the Chevrolet Suburban was found only in the rear door systems and utilized annealed glass. Annealed glass does not have the increased strength, increased fracture resistance, and reduced fractured glass particle size of the heat-strengthened glass found in current laminated side windows. DROP TEST PROTOCOL To evaluate the retention capabilities of the production door-window systems, an 18 kg (40 lb) impactor was dropped onto the glass at an impact speed of 24 km/h (15 mph). The fixture shown in Figure 1 was designed to allow translational and rotational adjustment of the various door glass assemblies involved in the test series. Brackets were welded onto the hinge and latch surfaces of each door and bolted to two steel shafts mounted in the rigid fixture. Each door panel was oriented such that the glass surface plane was horizontal (level) at the impact location and secured in place by clamping four shaft collars that were welded to the rigid stands. Using this set-up, each door was supported only at the hinge and latch attachment points to the vehicle, similar to their mounting in the respective vehicles. The pretest position of the headform was adjusted vertically for each door to achieve a drop height of 2.29 m (90.3 in), corresponding to a 24 km/h (15 mph) impact speed. 194</page><page sequence="3">Figure 1: Test fixture and setup The impactor consisted of the Free-Motion Headform (FMH), specified by Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 201 U, bolted to a 0.497 m (19.6 in) long cylindrical steel ballast. The total mass of the headform and ballast was 18 kg (40 lb). During the test series, asymmetrical loading of the headform face induced post-impact rotation, allowing the shaft of the ballast mass to contact the doorframe. This occurred after window separation from the doorframe and did not affect the test outcome; however, it did result in damage to the upper doorframe as the impactor passed through the original window plane. Following the first test, the ballast cylinder was changed to minimize the opportunity for post-test contact by increasing the diameter and reducing the overall length. Despite these modifications, the ballast weight still contacted the frame during some of the subsequent tests. The upper rear corner of the window was identified as the impact location based on a typical occupant seated position with respect to the door-window assembly, as well as evaluations of restrained rollover occupant kinematics (e.g., see Bahling, et al., 1990; Moffatt, et al., 1997; Newberry, et al., 2006) and recent observations of unbelted occupant-to-glazing contacts during full-scale rollover (Luepke, et al., 2007). To achieve a consistent location across the door-window assemblies evaluated in this test series, a template was created based on the projection of the frontal cross-section of the FMH (Figure 2). A one-inch border was extended around the perimeter of the projected area of the FMH to ensure that the headform edges were away from the door window frame, minimizing the opportunity for headform- to-window-frame contact. This permitted a more consistent test methodology, allowing for better comparison of the test results, and isolated the study with respect to trilaminate performance. The template border was positioned on the test window tangent to the upper and rear door seals, and the center of gravity (CG) location indicated on the template was used as the target impact location for the headform CG. Figure 2: FMH template for marking impact point (above) and positioning on one of the test windows (below). 195</page><page sequence="4">The headform was instrumented with a tri-axial accelerometer connected by an umbilical cable to the data acquisition system. The accelerometers were sampled at 10,000 Hz and low-pass filtered at CFC 1000 (as defined in SAE J211). The data were integrated to estimate vertical speed change during impact. Given the significant rotation of the headform that occurred after the seal separation, this analysis was limited to the interval from initial contact until the glass was visibly displaced from the seal. The test set-up and post-impact test door-glass assemblies were documented with still photographs. Each test was also documented with two high-speed video cameras recording at 1 ,000 frames per second and one real-time video camera. RESULTS In all of the tests, the impactor penetrated through the window opening. Illustrations of the impactor dynamics can be seen in Figure 3 and Figure 4; and post-test photographs of the windows are depicted in Figure 5. The capacity of the window systems to retain the headform impactor can be assessed from the velocity change experienced by the impactor prior to glass-seal separation. The velocity change is directly proportional to the impulse required to fracture and separate the trilaminate glass from the window seal. Values for the impactor velocity change in the vertical direction ranged from approximately 3 to 8 km/h (2 to 5 mph), well below that required to contain the impactor. At initial contact, each window frame flexed downward (outboard) until fracture of the glass. Window frame elastic deformation ranged from 13 mm (0.5 in) to 64 mm (2.5 in). Following glass fracture, the headform pocketed and the edges of the glass pulled out of the seal. The glass initially separated at the rear vertical channel adjacent to the contact point. As the contact event progressed, the glass separated from the seal along the upper doorframe, and continued along the sloped portion of the frame adjacent to the A-pillar. Initial separation between the glass and seal occurred within 20 ms of first contact. The glass, being supported by the window regulator, rotated around the beltline, vacated the window portal, and permitted the headform to pass through the window frame. The cylindrical ballast weight contacted the upper edge of the window frame after window glass separation as the headform continued through the window opening (Figure 3). Glass fragments were embedded in and visible abrasions were present on the headform skin. In addition, abraded headform skin material was present within the fractured glass surface. Figure 3: Individual frames captured from the high-speed video of the Volvo S60 test DISCUSSION The NHTSA spent more than a decade evaluating alternative materials for side window applications with a specific objective to mitigate occupant ejections (Atelsek, et al., 1995; Willke, et al., 1999; Willke, et al., 2001). Their multifaceted approach to this issue involved a combination of statistical analysis of field data, computer simulation, and various forms of component-level testing. The latter included evaluations of prototype window-door systems using: (1) sled and pendulum testing with anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs) to evaluate the extent of the occupant's total body mass that participates in the glazing surface interaction (i.e., the effective mass concept), (2) sled testing with ATDs to evaluate neck injury potential, (3) free-motion headform testing to evaluate head injury potential, and (4) testing with an 18 kg (40 lb) guided headform impactor to evaluate window retention capabilities. 196</page><page sequence="5">Figure 4: Individual frames captured from the high-speed video depicting impactor contact and penetration on each of the door-window assemblies tested. 197</page><page sequence="6">Figure 5: Post-test photographs of: (A) Jeep Grand Cherokee, (B) Chrysler Pacifica, (C) Chevrolet Trailblazer, (D) Lincoln Aviator, (E) Volvo S60, and (F) Chevrolet Suburban. 198</page><page sequence="7">The NHTSA originally proposed the development of their 18 kg (40 lb) guided impactor for testing at impact speeds of 32 km/h (20 mph) as part of their August 19, 1988, Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM), and indicated that retention at this level (defined as no penetration through the plastic layer) could be used as a performance specification (Atelsek, et al., 1995; ANPRM 53 FR 31712). In 1994, the Agency continued their investigation into "the problem of occupant ejection out of glazing" and created an Advanced Glazing Research Team, which developed a methodology and test device that could project an 18 kg (40 lb) impactor at 24 km/h (15 mph). In 1995, the NHTSA reported on sled and pendulum measurements of occupant effective mass during glazing contact, which were conducted at speeds ranging from 9.7 - 24 km/h (6-15 mph) (Atelsek et al., 1995). This work included a configuration that was deemed representative of rollover and emphasized a posture at glazing contact consistent with a restrained rollover occupant. This research revealed that more than 50% of the total body mass participated in glazing impact during a head and shoulder contact consistent with rollover. In other words, the effective mass of an occupant under these impact conditions (or the appropriate weight for an equivalent rigid impactor) should be well in excess of the 18 kg (40 lb) mass originally proposed. This was confirmed by the NHTSA in follow-up finite element modeling, which demonstrated that the 18 kg (40 lb) impactor imparted only 62% of the energy that was transferred to the load surface by the full ATD. Despite these findings, the NHTSA elected to continue their glazing retention evaluations using an 18 kg (40 lb) impactor. Thus, the NHTSA's retention test protocol is a conservative representation of the glazing loads produced by occupant loading. In reality, occupant containment during rollover is a very difficult task. In the real-world rollover environment, side window glass intended to retain occupants must be able to withstand multiple and relatively long-duration loading events produced by occupant impact, centrifugal forces, vehicle accelerations associated with ground contact, and, glazing loading and deformation due to vehicle-to- ground contact (Luepke et. al., 2007). Moreover, if unrestrained occupants are to be retained by side glass, the glazing must be able to accommodate loads associated with a multitude of occupant orientations at impact, which include, but are not limited to, the head and shoulder leading orientation evaluated by the NHTSA in their effective mass and neck injury evaluations (Atelsek et al., 1995; Willke et al., 1999; Willke et al., 2001). This is demonstrated by the Agency's simulations of unrestrained occupants in rollovers (Atelsek et al., 1995) as well as recent rollover crash testing (Luepke et. al., 2007). Both of these studies demonstrate a multitude of occupant postures at glazing contact, which imply effective masses greater than that observed during a head and shoulder glazing contact (Exponent, 2006). In the present study, the authors evaluated the retention capabilities of the current production heat-strengthened trilaminate door-glass systems using an 18 kg (40 lb) impactor at a 24 km/h (15 mph) impact speed. Despite the conservative energy level represented by this test protocol, the impactor was not retained by any door/glazing combination, regardless of channel type, retention overlap, glass or PVB thickness. The conservative energy level applied in this test protocol does not limit the current study. If a larger effective mass was utilized in this testing, it likewise would not have been retained. Using test protocol involving an 18 kg (40 lb) impacting the window-door assembly at 24 km/h (15 mph), the present testing demonstrated that current production heat-strengthened trilaminate door- glass systems are not an effective occupant retention system. These results are supportive of the NHTSA's findings in that laminated glass cannot be retained in a window frame under this test protocol unless the doorframe is highly modified beyond that which is reasonable for use in a production vehicle environment. The NHTSA has conducted testing of trilaminate glass under a number of conditions. These glazing door systems were perimeter- clamped glass, perimeter-encapsulated glass or heavily modified door-window systems that were not representative of production vehicles. Under some conditions, these modified door-glass systems were able to contain an 18 kg (40 lb) impactor an impact speed of 24 km/h (15 mph), however these configurations resulted in higher neck loads, which are associated with an increased risk of neck injury. In contrast, Kramer et al. (2006) has conducted drop testing onto production door-window assemblies equipped with heat strengthened trilaminate glazing which had been pre-fractured as a result of vehicle deformation. Under these conditions, the production door-window assembly did not contain a partial ATD weighing 18 kg (40 lbs) at an impact speed of 13 km/h (8 mph). Sanees et al. previously reported that testing utilizing laminated annealed glass and protocols "based on recent National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) studies for advanced glazing" would retain occupants (Sanees et al., 2002b). This testing was performed on 1980's vintage vehicles, including a 1983, 1984, and 1989 Chevrolet Suburban, using a 40 partial ATD. However, impact speeds were well below the 18 kg (40 lb) impactor target speed utilized by the NHTSA (Willke et al., 1999, 2001). In addition, the partial ATD was angled relative to the impact plane (Sanees, et al., 2003a, 2003b), reducing the overall effective mass loading the door-glass system (Exponent, 2006). As part of the present study, we utilized a protocol equivalent to the retention test adopted by NHTSA and dropped an 18 kg (40 lb) impactor vertically onto a window-door assembly from a Chevrolet Suburban of the same exemplar year range as the Suburban tested by Sanees, et al. (2003). Under this test condition, the 199</page><page sequence="8">impactor passed through the window frame and was not retained. In some prior studies, tempered glass installed in side windows has been criticized for its potential to cause lacerations (Yudenfriend, 1996; Yudenfriend and Clark, 1997). In contrast, Patrick (1995) reported that tempered glass, which is designed to fracture into small fragments with relatively dull edges, has very low lacerative potential. Although not a focus of the present study, the contact interactions between the headform and heat-strengthened trilaminate glazing observed in the present study demonstrate that heat-strengthened trilaminate glass poses significant lacerative potential following fracture. This occurs when relatively large and sharp (in contrast to smaller less-sharp tempered fragments) glass pieces are retained in close proximity to the area of contact post-impact due to the fragments adhering to the PVB interlayer. In this test series, the impactor pocketed in the PVB interlayer before the window pulled free of the door channel. Embedded glass fragments and gouges were found in the rubber headform skin following testing, and pieces of headform skin were deposited on the fractured glass surface. The potential for laceration under these conditions is readily apparent. CONCLUSION A series of drop tests was conducted on a representative subset of current production trilaminate door-glass systems using a protocol based on the NHTSA's retention assessment (18 kg headform at 24 km/h). None of the tested door-window systems retained the headform impactor. The performance of the window system represented, at most, one-third of the impulse/delta-v necessary to contain the impactor. As compared to the performance necessary to retain a rollover occupant, the retention tests conducted in this study demonstrated similar performance between current production systems. These test results, combined with the prior research by NHTSA and others concerning occupant effective mass during rollovers, lead to the conclusion that the current production heat- strengthened trilaminate door-glass systems are not suitable for occupant retention during rollover.
