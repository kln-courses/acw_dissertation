Ci82.50. The Phenomenon of Religion. By NINIAN SMART. Macmillan, 1973. PP. V+I57. ?2.95. At first one might think that these three books have very little in common. Kai Nielsen's programme is a familiar one. In the five chapters of his book he tries to distinguish between philosophical scepticism and religious scepticism, to resist any attempt to deny that foundations must be sought for religious beliefs, to deny that any such foundation can be found in religious experience, to meet a number of theological counter- arguments, and to conclude that whereas all anthropomorphic beliefs in God are false, all other conceptions of God are meaningless. Michael Durrant takes a closer look at the notion of God, finding no philosophical satisfaction in the suggestions that 'God' is a proper name, a descriptive predicable term, or like anything suggested by non-propositional accounts of ascribing attributes to God. While Michael Durrant takes a close look at one notion, Ninian Smart takes a quick look at many. At times, in the course of his four chapters, the subject-matter is hardly philoso- phical in character, reading more like an apologia for a certain way of going about the study of religion. Smart brings out the variety of disciplines involved in the study of religion, what is meant by treating religion as a phenomenon, the importance of myths, and how the tensions between the study of religion and specific theological viewpoints can be resolved. Yet, despite the obvious differences in the topics with which these philosophers are concerned, one finds common philosophical threads running through their work, common assumptions which still charac- terise contemporary philosophy of religion. I shall concentrate on three of these. The first assumption concerns one of the most important questions in the philosophy of religion: the sense in which religious belief has an .object. Despite a great deal of lip-service to the variety of criteria at work in different areas of discourse, for Nielsen, if 'God' is to mean anything, it must refer to some kind of object or entity. The choice he offers us is clearly stated early on: 'But God-talk is either like Zeus-talk, in that it is anthropomorphic and makes straightforwardly false claims, or unlike Zeus-talk, it is non-anthropomorphic and makes putative truth- claims which are neither verifiable nor falsifiable even in principle and, hence, are in 'reality not genuine truth claims' (p. 8). Putting aside this unsatisfactory view of what it is to believe in Zeus, what does this dis- tinction amount to? If one asks what is to count as a putative truth- claim, one finds oneself back at Nielsen's conception of Zeus-talk. So there has been no grammatical shift in the notion of 'talking about' in the two contexts, and no recognition by Nielsen of the possibilities in language which would necessitate recognition of such a shift. At first, it seems that Michael Durrant has recognised the importance of being alive to grammatical differences where talk of God is concerned. This is</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS I55 the whole point of his attack on those who have construed 'God' as a proper name or as a descriptive predicable term. But when he comes to consider other possibilities we find him arguing like this: 'If it is part of the "grammar" of the goodness of God, or follows from that "grammar", that nothing can possibly constitute God's goodness failing, then it must also follow from that "grammar" that nothing can consti- tute God's goodness operating either and if nothing can possibly consti- tute this then the notion of God's goodness operating is itself a nonsensical one, for the sense of "operating" is dependent upon the sense of the notion of "failing to operate"; they are correlatives' (p. 82). But what sense of 'operating' is so dependent? One may think of the activities of a person or the descriptions of the proper workings of a machine. But Durrant has just spent two chapters telling us that 'God' cannot be understood in this way. Now we find him criticising an account of God's activity for not meeting requirements which he himself has argued are inappropriate! He says rightly that 'no Christian would want to deny that the notion of God's goodness operating is one which is present in Christian discourse' (p. 82), but takes little trouble to see what that notion might mean within such discourse. There are similar tensions relating to the object of faith in Ninian Smart's book, but one of the strengths of his treatment is that he stresses the inadequacies of treating religious beliefs as if they were metaphysical theories. He sees that the reality of God is bound up with activities of worship, and emphasises the expressive character of religious beliefs. The strength and the tension can be illustrated by a sentence with a comic ending: 'Common as it may be to define religion by reference to belief in God, gods, etc.... there may be merit in looking at the Focus or Foci of religious activity through the medium of the mythic, that is, in a context where such entities are acting, not just so to say quietly existing' (p. 79). The failure to recognise grammatical differences also influences the second characteristic running through these books. In an attempt to bring out that the reality of God is different from the reality of one thing among many I have spoken from time to time of religious beliefs as pictures which set limits on what can be said to God and about God. Both Nielsen and Durrant criticise my work in this respect. Nielsen, however, uses 'picture' in the sense of photograph and so searches for the object to which the picture corresponds. Durrant too requires decision procedures to decide between the truth-claims of various pictures. Such talk does not take seriously the use of 'picture' where it indicates the grammatical context which would determine the meaning of belief and doubt, truth and falsity. When Nielsen and Durrant ask whether such pictures correspond to reality their questions betray the same misunderstanding of those which ask whether what Wittgenstein called grammatical rules correspond to reality. Similar tensions are to be found in Smart's book. At tfimes he recognises that religious experience is something which can only have a meaning within the context of religious language and tradition, but at other times he speaks of religious experience as if it were independent of religious beliefs and could act as a check against which they could be assessed. At one stage he speaks as</page><page sequence="3">I56 BOOK REVIEWS if the Focus were necessarily beyond all religious expressions (pp. 64- 65). Also, in facing the question of the truth of religious belief, Smart in the end settles for the view that religion is true if it explains human experience better than any of its competitors. I find this deeply confused because it speaks of human experience as if it had a reality independent of the various ways of living human beings engage in, among.them, the religions of the world. Thirdly, a brief word about the way in which our authors see the relation between their philosophical reflections and religious belief. Nielsen, by defining what he means by intelligibility from the outset has ruled out the acceptability of any alternative. Durrant's position is a curious one. He claims to believe within the Church what philosophical analysis has shown him to be nonsense. Smart's philosophical discussion, despite his disclaimer, covers a yearning for what he calls 'a world religious pluralism' (p. io), and never resolves the tension between itself and specific theological viewpoints. Since religious belief is an explana- tion of religious experience, the belief must be tentative, modifiable in the light of new facts. To Nielsen one feels like saying, 'Don't think, look!', to Durrant, 'Look again', and to Smart, 'In looking widely, remember that what is ragged must be left ragged, at least, as far as philosophy is concerned'.
