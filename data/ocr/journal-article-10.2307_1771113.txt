<plain_text><page sequence="1">A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE. By BarbaraJohnson. Baltimore and London:Johns Hopkins University Press, 1987. xii, 225 p. The title of this book is meant to convey the distance traveled between Johnson's The Critical Difference and her more recent effort. Her goal is to "transfer the analysis of difference... out of the realm of linguistic universality or deconstructive allegory and into contexts in which difference is very much at issue in the 'real world"' (p. 2). This shift in emphasis or in context involves a critical rereading of the earlier work. "It was when I realized that my discussion ...was taking place entirely within the Sameness of the white male Euro-American. . . canon that I began to ask myself what differences I was really talking about" (p. 2). This tale of self-criticism and, necessarily, of self-trans- cendence is in fact so insistent and so compelling that it makes evaluating the book in any other terms difficult. But this project of literary criticism as self-portrait is one of the problems that Johnson is both addressing and avoiding. Barbara Johnson is a self-confessed "Yale daughter" (p. 39), a particularly favored student and disciple of the late Paul de Man. The first five essays, collected under the rubric "The Fate of Deconstruction," present her speaking in that quasi-official capacity. Since deconstruction has been attacked by the critical establishment, Johnson demon- strates that the latter's arguments inevitably espouse the logic of non-contradiction, assuming that, since deconstruction has rejected its "positive" values, it necessarily falls into the traps that those values guard against (namely, solipsism, obscurity, relativism, skepticism). In fact, however, deconstruction questions the logic of non-contradiction and attempts to write in an "other" logic. Since, inversely, deconstruction has been accused by political critics of remaining within the canon and the institution, Johnson must caution against such a hermeticism and argue that deconstruction, in the way it differs from itself, holds the key to this "Yale lock." She introduces the notion of "surprise" as a way to counteract the risk of decon- struction's becoming just another -ism. Johnson also takes it upon herself to articulate deconstruction with feminism, revealing the male bias of the Yale school at both the institutional and the textual level. The articles are clever, polemic, and seamless. If anything, they are a bit too tidy: by rarely naming her opponents and discussing the debates in the most general terms, she gives the impression of having resolved the question adequately when, in many cases, she has barely scratched the surface of the issues involved. In the best article of this group, "Rigorous Unreliability," Johnson skillfully shows 282</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS the paradoxical value that referential criticism occupies in de Man's theory of literature. In his introductory remarks to an essay on Proust, he notes that while "literature neces- sarily breeds its own formalism . .critics cry out for the fresh air of referential meaning" (quoted p. 21). The distinction he sets up is made on the basis of necessity (metaphor) and contingency (metonymy), the very terms he deconstructs in his subsequent discussion of Proust. Proust uses metaphor to reconcile the inside and the outside and thereby "overcome the guilt of inwardness" (p. 22). If, as de Man claims, metaphor depends upon metonymy for this reconciliation, then Marcel "and by implication, close(ted) reading" (p. 22) are still guilty. It is that guilt that haunts much of A World ofDifference. The rest of the book is devoted to a reading of literary texts that combines efforts to "uncover the workings of 'differences within"' while dealing with "a subject matter that asks the question of difference as if 'differences between' had referential validity" (p. 2). In spite of the larger questions that theoretically unite the book, each chapter stands more or less alone, succeeding or failing on its own terms. Some of the readings are excellent: "Teaching Ignorance," a Felmanesque analysis of Moliere's School for Wives that shows how the play's staging of pedagogy anticipates the pedagogical uses to which the play has been put, stands out in particular. And the pages on Gwendolyn Brooks's "The Mother" are a poignant discussion of the problems raised by women poets writing on abortion. In a way, the chapter is a strong rereading of de Man's "Autobiography as De-facement" and "Anthropomorphism and Trope in the Lyric" that demonstrates how the Romantic problematic of the "lost child-the speaker's own former self' (p. 188) is complicated when the speaker is a woman whose child was lost through her own decision to have an abortion. Other chapters, like the short essay on a passage from Thoreau's Walden, are unexcep- tional to the point of being trite. Many are simply uneven: Johnson makes a convincing argument that the conventional view of Mallarmi as a Symbolist who abstracted and purified language at the expense of the referent is based on the institutional privilege given to the last revision and the Complete Works. In fact, Mallarme was extremely sensitive to the historical context and situation of each of his writings. But when she goes on to claim that Ferdinand de Lesseps, in designing the Panama Canal according to the exact model he used for the Suez Canal, was a (bad) Symbolist poet because he ignored the referent, she only succeeds in pointing out the dangers of unchecked analogy. Only four of the sixteen chapters deal with authors who could be considered non-ca- nonical. The two chapters on Zora Neale Hurston exemplify the problems faced by a missionary of deconstruction. Critics of lesser known works always bear the added burden of having to demonstrate that the books are worthy of attention. But Johnson places her entire reading within the frame of her personal quest for the "real world." Since she comes to the text asking "What [was] I, a white deconstructor.. .doing talking about Zora Neale Hurston, a black novelist and anthropologist...?" (p. 172) she runs the familiar risk of confronting otherness only to the extent that it offers a mirror image of herself. Noting that Hurston had been criticized by other blacks because "wealthy white people... simply paid her just to sit around and represent the Negro race for them" (quoted 173), Johnson goes on to say that her chapter will stage the encounter between the black writer and her white audience because she is a "student of literature trained in the European tradition and interested in Hurston out of a concern for the non-canon- ical" (p. 174). Johnson's defense of Hurston's adoption of the "perfect darkie" stance (it is, she says, a "successful strategy for survival" [p. 174]) is troubling because Johnson is, in effect, one of her patrons, watching Hurston sit around and represent the non-ca- nonical. 283</page><page sequence="3">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE And it is clear that Johnson is looking for a solution to her own problems, or an absolution of her guilt. She focuses on the moment in Their Eyes Were Watching God when the protagonist becomes conscious of her oppression as a woman and understands that "she had an inside and an outside now and suddenly she knew how not to mix them" (p. 162). Johnson notes that "Janie's increasing ability to speak grows out of her ability not to mix inside with outside...but to assume and articulate the incompatible forces in her own division. The sign of an authentic voice is thus not self-identity but self-dif- ference" (p. 164). "Self-difference" is of course the value of values in The Critical Difference and Johnson is here trying to hang on to it while at the same time affirming the feminist value of "authentic voice." Yet in this case, it seems that Janie's coming to consciousness involves not only self-division but also, and more importantly, a knowledge capable of transcending it. This is one of the major problems with A World of Difference: there is a drive to bring feminism around to deconstruction, or to tinker with deconstruction in order to make it more politically acceptable, without a real recognition of the very different stakes of the two critical traditions and the enormous difficulties involved in any confrontation between them. The book does not always succeed; the best one can say is that it tends to fail in interesting, and symptomatic, ways. The direction Johnson is moving in is certainly a promising one and it is safe to say that her best work lies ahead. JANE MARIE TODD Reed College</page></plain_text>
