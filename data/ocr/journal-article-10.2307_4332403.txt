<plain_text><page sequence="1">THOUGHT AND SENSIBILITY By MARTIN LEBOWITZ THE fact that sensibility is a function of intelligence has im- portant implications. It is popularly, and not alone popular- ly, believed that thought and feeling are mutually opposed, that we employ one at the risk of ignoring or incapacitating the other. This false notion, so common among writers since the renaissance, and widespread even today, but singularly absent from medieval and classical literature, reflects a basic division in modern culture which science and technology have done much to bring about. The tendency of writers in the last century to make art a religion, a social corrective, or a refuge survives in our own day among critics like I. A. Richards, who sees art as a kind of therapy, and also among men like T. S. Eliot, whose inclination, equally objection- able, is to make religion an art-a set of beliefs having no factual warrant but rather an emotional utility for a society depressed and debilitated by industrialism and science. Whereas Richards, echoing Coleridge, advocates a temporary "suspension of disbe- lief," Eliot, in effect, wants the suspension to be permanent. This is the "pragmatic" fallacy, which does not begin with James and Nietzsche but goes at least as far back as Kant. And, like other features of literature and philosophy in the 19th Century, it marks the divorce of feeling and thought which began with the death of medievalism and was widened and deepened by the spread of industrialism; a divorce which meant for the personality of the individual a separation of the cognitive from the moral and aesthetic, and for society, a separation of practical or productive</page><page sequence="2">220 KENYON REVIEW activities not merely from their fruits but from enjoyment and human (which is ideal) significance. That is to say, the divorce was a cultural phenomenon which had unfavorable effects, and for this reason: no true separation of emotion and intellect, of practical means from human conse- quences, is possible; so that a culture which fosters their division will succeed often in starving, debilitating, perverting either or both. Eliot has called contemporary philosophy unbalanced. And one may agree, without, however, exonerating Eliot himself from the charge. But what is a well-balanced philosophy? To ask this is perhaps to beg the question, or to desert philosophy for some other discipline, such as psychoanalysis. Nevertheless it seems clear that philosophy is well-balanced when it succeeds in accom- modating both the ideal and the real, the desirable and the actual -in other words, feeling and thought. That it is no easy task the record shows, and there is no assurance that it can be repeat- ed in a manner sufficient for our time. Aquinas and Aristotle are of course the exemplars of symmetry and sanity; but who today can assent to either without suspending disbelief? Yet to be a Thomist in the 13th Century, or an Aristotelian in the 4th B.C., was to have a sound orientation to life. This suggests an import- ant point: that sanity is a concept without meaning except in re- lation to a particular culture, in relation to the illusion which one age will approve and another reject. Every age has its mythology, just as every man has his; myth- ology consists of those anthropomorphic illusions which are pro- jections of sensibility. In a sophisticated age they are called ideals or moral meanings, though even then they are often mistaken for facts. Without them there would be no morality and, one may suspect, no conduct, since emotion is not merely conation but also, almost invariably, a form of belief in which something is seen or felt as meaning something else. As such it has no cognitive value. (From the functional standpoint emotions do have cognitive value:</page><page sequence="3">SENSIBILITY 221 the emotion of fear, for example. is proleptic, a warning based on past experience. But as predicates applied to existence emotions are illusory.) But it does possess rationality: since it is meaning felt in conative form, emotion is always a function of intelligence and of knowledge, the indispensable link between knowledge and conduct. This might be taken to mean that all thinking is wishful, a notion rejected by Freud himself. The truth is that knowledge may be objective but never dispassionate; it is irrational inasmuch as it reflects a need or an inclination to judge and explain exper- ience by one standard rather than another; and it is irrational in- as much as thought is interpenetrated with feeling. All intellect- ual innovations bring changes of sensibility; to know differently is to feel differently; and since feeling naturally translates itself into belief (while becoming manifest in behavior) all knowledge, even the most exact, is a source and a subject for mythology. A moment's reflection must convince one of this; and yet, though we recognize the myth in Platonism and Christianity, we fail to see it, for example, in Bertrand Russell's "A Free Man's Worship," simply because in that piece Russell expresses one of the dominant illusions of our age; nor do we see the myth in "The Modern Temper," though Krutch's exaggerated picture of an apathetic alien universe is itself an example of anthropomorphism. The point is that though philosophy may become engrossed ex- clusively in technical and analytic concerns, substituting logical an- alysis for metaphysics, leaving mythology to the poets, in the human personality there can be no such division. Eliot says in his fine piece on Dante: ". . . the love of man and woman is only explained and made reasonable by the higher love, or else is simply the coupling of animals." This is a false dilem- ma but a characteristic criticism of the moral deficiency of mod- em culture; a deficiency that is the result not merely of material- ism or naturalism, for periods before ours, such as the Hellenic period and the 18th Century, produced some fairly sound ad-</page><page sequence="4">222 KENYON REVIEW justments of attitudes to facts in a universe conceived as non-pur- posive. The dilemma is not really one of a morally unacceptable universe; it is based on the subversive effects of industrialism and specialization, which have disorganized society almost beyond repair, introducing a variety, indeterminacy and discontinuity into human motives and desires which have disintegrated experience and vitiated sensibility. Sentimentality may be defined as the expression of an emotion disproportionate to its object. But, strictly speaking, all emotion, insofar as it is a kind of belief, is in excess of the facts. Every word and experience is saturated with superfluous meanings hav- ing no cognitive value; these in addition to the indefinite number of implications, possessed by every word and every assertion, which do have cognitive value but can never be wholly certified. The awareness of such superfluous meanings constitutes emotional perception. Consequently, to call the world non-teleological is usually to produce an impression, or evoke an image, unwarranted by the facts which justify the use of that term: the deception is as great as when the world is said to be alive or divinely ordered. The fact, taken by itself, that science is mechanistic and material- istic, and will remain so, despite the uncertainty principle and the theory of relativity (neither of which has altered scientific method in any important respect), is ground neither for despair nor ex- ultation. Science will remain materialistic in this sense: to speak of existence, as distinguished from mere subjective impressions, is always and perhaps necessarily to speak of objects and their properties. And science will remain mechanistic because its aim is to correlate conditions with events, to discover the specific deter- minants even of vital phenomena. This is not to deny that human behavior is purposive: it clearly is purposive. But what from a moral standpoint exists as a purpose, from a scientific standpoint exists as a force, having determinate relations to physical and mental conditions. The point is simply that sound moral attitude cannot be re-</page><page sequence="5">SENSIBILITY 223 stored at the cost of denying what we know to be true: the at- tempt to find a remedy in such a sacrifice produced the extrava- gances and disequilibrium of romanticism, which are still mani- fest, even among those who call themselves anti-romantic. And, as has been said, there is historical evidence for the view that the race can develop and fulfill ideal incentives that experience can have an orientation towards perfection, without the encourage- ment of a deity or an animated universe. If mankind has a future commensurate with its past, either in quality or duration, (and one may reasonably doubt that it has), then the morbid flux of conflicting forces and competing alternatives must be stabilized somehow and made coherent. A continuity must be reintroduced into experience, and this can only be done by social reform. Just what changes must be made is a question for another occasion: the point concerning us here is that the sensibility of an age is an expression of its entire cul- ture, which has physical, practical and intellectual aspects. Sanity, personal and social, largely means order, balance and proportion among the various departments of life, each of which is contigu- ous to the others, drawing its quality and value from the whole. 2. The interdependence of thought and sensibility has implica- tions for literary criticism also. It was suggested originally that the tendency to place science and art at opposite poles, by calling one intellectual and cognitive and the other emotional and sensuous, reflects the disunity of modern culture. Science and art are not identical, in some re- spects they are opposed; but there is greater affinity between them than many believe. Writers like Bergson, T. E. Hulme and Croce have done much to establish the view, nowadays so widespread, that intellectual analysis precludes aesthetic intuition by diverting the mind from qualities to relations, from the immediate to the contingent. True, science and art differ in that the former studies things as signs of other things or as determinant conditions,</page><page sequence="6">224 KENYON REVIEW whereas the latter fastens attention on experience as an end in it- self. Nevertheless, empirical qualities are distinguished as such and become specifically accessible to awareness largely by virtue of the mind's analytic power: they are perceptible insofar as they can be recognized, that is, insofar as they can be designated in discourse; and to be designated is to participate in the vast system of logical relations embodied in language. So that the discursive faculty makes clear perception possible. This point is important for poetry, indicating that science and art are manifestations of intelligence because both are formal, both dependent on the discursive capacity of mind. The essential (and paradoxical) feature of consciousness is that it is at once relational or cognitive and aesthetic; perception is vivid and dis- criminating in proportion as it is characterized by understanding: in both science and art understanding consists of the awareness of something as a sign of something else. That is to say, the virtue of intelligence is that it imposes form on experience: in the case of science, or of knowledge in general, form is cognitive; in the case of art, form again consists of meaningful relations, only here the effect is sensuous; the paradox being that each portion of a work of art, by receiving significant relations to the rest and the whole, become in itself vivid, engrossing and clearly perceptible. This explains why emotion is precise only to the extent that its object is precisely realized; for the emotions evoked by a work of art constitute its form, in the sense that its form is the totality of its meanings. For example, in the drama, which is the most formal of lit- erary types, the value and interest of any episode depends large- ly on its significance in relation to the whole: its significance largely is, in fact, its relation to the whole. And the emotion as- sociated with it is, again, simply the awareness of this signifi- cance, this relation. In Kantian terms, emotion may be called the form of aesthetic awareness. It must of course be acknowledged that no work of literature</page><page sequence="7">SENSIBILITY 225 is interesting or moving solely because of its intrinsic form. Art always relies at least partially on extraneous associations. The main consequence of form, however, is that in any portion of a work the rest of it is presumed and implied (just as in science, where a vast theoretical structure is implicit in any assertion). Sometimes more is presumed than merely the work of art: a knowledge of other works is often essential, as in Joyce, Eliot and Pound, or a knowledge of historical personages and occur- rences, as in Swift and other satirists. To determine the nature of form in any literary work is to discover exactly what each im- age or episode presupposes for its intelligibility and effect. In Joyce and Eliot the main formal device is comparison and contrast. In Ulysses at least part of the comedy consists in the disproportion between the modern characters and their legendary counterparts; and the Homeric themes, given contemporary em- bodiment, receive the character and force of universality. Where- as Flaubert wrote three books, each dependent on the others, to suggest and exemplify the inferiority of the present to the past, Joyce sharpens the contract by presenting it in a single work. The same technique appears in "The Waste Land": But at my back from time to time I hear The sound of horns and motors, which shall bring Sweeney to Mrs. Porter in the spring. O the moon shone bright on Mrs. Porter And on her daughter They wash their feet in soda water Et 0 ces voix d'enfants, chantant dans la coupole! The first line is of course partly from Marvell; the next two, as Eliot points out, are intended to suggest the following from the "Parliament of Bees": When of the sudden, listening you shall hear, A noise of horns and hunting which shall bring Actaeon to Diana in the spring, Where all shall see her naked skin. The last line is from Verlaine's "Parsifal," as Eliot indicates.</page><page sequence="8">226 KENYON REVIEW One might suppose erroneously that this method has only a limited use, for purposes of arresting contrast. The following, from Part V of "The Waste Land," depicting the passage of the disciples to Emmaeus, displays the same technique producing a somewhat different impression: Who is the third who walks always beside you? When I count there are only you and I together But when I look ahead up the white road There is always another one walking beside you Gliding wrapt in a brown mantle, hooded.... Eliot tells us in his notes that he associates the hooded figure, who accompanies the disciples, with the Hanged God of Frazer; and he makes this comment, which explains the significance of the passage: The lines were stimulated by the account of one of the antarctic expeditions . . . : It was related that the party of explorers, at the extremity of their strength, had the constant delusion that there was one more member than could actually be counted. The word "white" in the third line instantly connects the ant- arctic with its climatic opposite, the desert over which the dis- ciples pass; and the desert is of course the waste land itself; the hallucinatory hooded figure is intended in this context as an im- plicit commentary on the experience and conception of the super- natural. Eliot's method is objective, therefore, despite its difficulties for the reader, in contradistinction to the more intelligible vague- ness of the poetry he condemns. He himself has justly insisted that this is so; and insofar as he is successful his work is highly formal, its form being the complex relations of disparate im- ages and ideas. The variety and diversity of his material is actually the index of the formality of his work, and of the ex- tent to which it embodies clear and exact perception. Nowhere in literature, perhaps, is there a better demonstration of sensi- bility as the correlate of intelligence.</page><page sequence="9">SENSIBILITY 227 Though Eliot is the literary descendent of the French symbol- ists, he has not been influenced by Mallarme or Valery. His method is in a sense the opposite of that of Mallarme, whose nearest affinity in English is probably Swinburne. According to Val6ry, literature is "an art which is based on the abuse of lan- guage. . . Everyhing which makes language more precise, which emphasizes its practical character . . . (is) contrary to its function as a poetic instrument" (quoted by Edmund Wilson in Axel's Castle). This conception of poetry as exalted ambig- uity is fashionable now; nor is it wholly false: but it is less true for some poets than others. Poetry does indeed rely on sugges- tion and evocation; and it is true that a writer-like Joyce, for example, in Finnegans Wake - may be ambiguous (and ob- scure) without being vague. But we have indicated that feeling in art is a counterpart of meaning, that one is lucid and exact in proportion as the other is. The same faculty which gives accur- acy to thought and prudence to conduct gives refinement, exacti- tude and scope to feeling, and form to art. The desire to di- vorce the literary use of language from its analytic use is simply another manifestation of the disunity of modern culture. And the important point for literary criticism is this: those works are the most truly formal which are the most significant; to separate form from subject matter is to destroy form altogether. The symbolists, thinking they had purged poetry of everything but form, had in fact made it amorphous, an art dependent on ex- traneous and casual associations. It is in this sense that the poetry of Swinburne is formless.</page></plain_text>
